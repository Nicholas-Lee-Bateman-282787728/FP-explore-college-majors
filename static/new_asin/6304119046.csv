And several months ago when I saw that the AFI had selected it the number 1 American  film of all time, I was stunned. Who are these people? I know Citizen Kane  is partly based on a real person's life, but the plot totally sucked. The  acting wasn't great either. Everyone talks about the cinematography, well I  wasn't even impressed with that, though I suppose back when it was release  it was something.",917049600,,540,4.36

792732,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane is accepted by many to be a classic, a great story that is told in a very innovative way. It is worth seeing more than once and thinking about what is being presented and how it is done. I thought it is worthwhile sharing the thoughts of the Chief Rabbi of England. This is what he wrote in one of his lectures:
Something happened to the cinema at that point. Namely  and maybe it happened before: this is just the point I can date, Citizen Kane, 1941  what happened is this. That cinema liberated itself for that moment from the conventions of the theatre. In other words, until then a lot of movies  not all  were like theatre only on film. But the mobile camera liberated cinema from the conventions of the theatre.
I just want to remind you and remind ourselves what happens when you are sitting in a theatre watching a play. When you sit in a theatre watching the play, all the action is taking place in a world that exists on the stage. You are in a different world. Even though you are entering into the reality of the drama, you are not actually part of that world. You cannot suddenly interrupt in the middle of Othello and say, Hes telling a lie, for heavens sake!  and change the plot to a happy ending! You cannot do that! Because the play is in one dimension of reality. You are in another dimension of reality and you are in a fixed vantage point: the point of view of the gods. You are seeing the play as a detached observer. A detached observer that can see and hear everything but cannot influence events.
In other words, what Orson Welles did when he moved the camera was to break the convention of a static observer. He suddenly allowed us to see things from a moving point of view.",1504656000,2,1714,4.327102803738318

792735,5,6304119046,"Is Citizen Kane ""The Greatest Film Ever Made"" as is often cited by film critics and fans alike since its release?

I think that is subjective and entirely up to the viewer, that is, you. Someone could trace Citizen Kane's greatness in its legacy and massive influence on every single film it influenced afterwards. I believe that Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever directed. For it is Orson Welles' fine attention to detail, meticulous storytelling, and his utmost care in the crafting of his art that makes Citizen Kane so notable.

He chose very specific sequences, shots, and scenes to hopefully get the audience to understand that man that was Charles Foster Kane. The film starts with a news reel that tells Kane's entire life. We learn the ""whens"" and ""whats"" of his life.

Then we follow a journalist hoping to uncover the significance and meaning to Kane's last word: ""Rosebud."" In this journey, he interviews Kane's ""whos"": his adopted father, his banker, his best friend, his second wife, and finally his butler. Herein, we find out the ""hows"" of Kane's life. The intimate details of his mortal coil as Kane's closest citizens experienced them.

Lastly, upon the great reveal of the biggest twist ending in film history, you understand the ""why"" in Kane's life. Why did Charles Foster Kane do what he did. Why buy things instead of investing, why love who he loved, and in the way he loved. It all makes sense and Welles plotted it all out for you.

For Orson Welles, Kane is just a man that he may explain as a film character. It's all there for you to find out and enjoy as you will for yourself.

Films are unique in the world of art as they are a visual medium for an auteur director to reveal something to the audience. We see what we want to see as well as what the director intends for us to see in their work.

Orson Welles' debut film Citizen Kane is a clear example of a masterful director focusing the audience's view on particular shots, subjects, themes, characters, developments, reveals all through cinematography, editing, and the unique angling of the lens. Welles accomplishes so very much in this movie.

The acting is excellent throughout from all actors and actresses. You believe everyone. The old age makeup and the makeup to make them appear weary and worn is so authentic. The sets are grand, Bernard Herrmann's score is intense and magnificent like the man that is Charles Foster Kane.

However, these are all merely clockwork to the final machination of Citizen Kane as a film. All of these aspects are supervised lovingly and hand crafted by Orson Welles. I think Welles truly made a masterpiece of film. For all its individual parts are remarkable, but what endures about Citizen Kane is how Welles speaks to humanity's greatest theme and motivation: love. It is this simple beautiful thing that we function for, with, and towards evermore.",1504224000,,2883,4.75

793005,5,6304119046,"This review is for the two disc set of Orson Welles 1941 masterpiece Citizen Kane, which has endlessly (and rightfully) been called the greatest film ever made. Of course, I'm not going to go over the whole plot, which to film lovers is already gospel. This review is to concentrate on the technical and scholastic aspects of Kane, namely this two dvd set. And there are three very good reasons to get this particular copy of Kane.

1. The film itself, which has rarely looked better. It's a very crisp print, in which details obscured in earlier versions are now wonderfully clear. The soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann has never sounded better. Maybe the most overlooked great film soundtrack ever. All the technical wizardry at play in this film, from the lighting to the camera angles to the special effects (which, when pointed out, are absolutely astounding) seem to be just so much more breathtaking in this version. It's certainly as good as the movie can possibly look.

2. The audio commentary by the late, great Roger Ebert. (I'm guessing it was recorded in the late 90's/early 00's, before he lost the ability to speak.) Mr. Ebert stated on more than a few occasions that this was his favorite movie of all time. The commentary shows that at absolutely every turn. He's the perfect person to take you on a guided tour of the dark alleys, brightly-lit paths, strange regions and brilliant hidden corners that make this film so magnificent. I could never get tired of hearing him talk about how the deep focus camera work in Kane is so carefully and subtly handled. Or how the special effects are just as revolutionary as, say, Star Wars, without being noticed much, if at all. Or fascinating tidbits, such as how the actor who portrays the reporter, Thompson, is also the stentorian voice of the announcer in the opening News on the March segment. Most important of all, Mr. Ebert shows you how to appreciate this film, for all it's worth, like no one else can. Whether you end up loving the film and making it your cinematic lifeblood, or decide that it's too inflated, dark, slow paced, and maybe even overrated, is up to you. But you will understand why this film is considered perhaps the greatest film of all time.

3. The bonus documentary on the 2nd dvd, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which was originally aired on PBS back in 1996 as part of the series American Experience. This nearly two hour doc is about how Welles clashed with newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, the purported inspiration for Charles Foster Kane. How the film took Hearst's life, loves, and powerful ego and transformed them into the ultimate parable of business: you were happiest when you had nothing except what you loved most. How Hearst tried to suppress, and even destroy the film. How the career of Welles took off like Comet, and then burned out into wine commercials. How the film vanished from the public view for many years, only to reappear with the position in history it still holds today. This is one of the best documentaries ever made on movies, business, power, politics, Hollywood and celebrity. I'd say it's worth the price of admission, but when you get the greatest film ever to boot, well you can't go wrong.

  Also there are some other features of note, such as a second commentary by director Peter Bogdonovich. This one is interesting, but not as good as Mr. Ebert's. Since PB knew Welles and hung out with him a lot in later years, it's more of a bit chummy and anecdotal in nature. Plus there are also other extras such as the original trailer for the film, (don't pass it up, it's priceless) a photo gallery and a tiny bit of film of the world premiere. In all, it's the Kane 101 you will need in your film theory class (If you're into that sort of thing.) But with a movie as classic, timeless, groundbreaking, endlessly watchable and almost symphonic as this, you may never have to go to film school. -----------------PEACE
BTW- Just for the record, my favorite bit of dialogue in Kane is:
  ""You know Mr. Thatcher, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in..............sixty years!""",1496880000,10,4142,4.687757909215956

793008,2,6304119046,"Talk about a movie that hasn't aged well and doesn't hold up! ""Citizen Kane"" is one of them. Was it groundbreaking for it's time utilizing new filming techniques? Sure. But us people- We live now sadly and there is very little story here. I know the pretentious hipster crowd still talk about it but I suspect even they don't truly like this dated bore.

The movie is good enough to almost be interesting but never quite gets there. The ending is one of the biggest anticlimaxes in movie history. And also,the ending,whether climactic or not,has zero consequences or implications for the characters in the story.

Basically the whole movie is a search for what the dying words of Kane really meant. The journalists come close to finding out but never do. This doesn't matter though because the audience finds out what Kane's dying words are and it turns out that the words actually would have not had any impact on anyone whatsoever whether known or not. ""Rosebud"" is just a child's sled. Means nothing. Had very little to do with Kane's life.

Second, there's the seemingly insoluble mystery of who or what is Rosebud.  Third, and most important, there's the development of a tragic character.  Kane begins as a normal child, until he is sent away from his beloved mother and loses his favorite toy at the same time.  Next we see him as a brash, fun-loving young man.  Next he becomes a tycoon who tries repeatedly to buy love (which he lost with his mother) and very expensive ""toys"" (paralleling the loss of his favorite toy as a child).  He becomes an egocentric tyrant who alienates every friend.  Finally, he dies a lonely recluse surrounded by the trappings of wealth that could do nothing to help him.  Kane is a huge success with money, but a failure as a human being.  The theme is straight from Ecclesiastes: ""All is vanity.""  And, yes, the viewer does discover the solution to the mystery, unexpectedly, at the film's very end.

Don't watch it because you remember your film appreciation professor mentioned it in her lecture once (the time you actually went to class).  Don't even watch it because of Amazon reviews like this one.  Watch ""Citizen Kane"" to watch a brave movie from the 40's that still manages to entertain 75 years later.

Is it dated?  Yes.  Is it perfect?  No.  Is it the best movie of all time?  How can one movie please everyone, all the time?  It doesn't (that movie, of course, would be ""Bio Dome"").  Is it entertaining?  I think so.

Why is it brave?  The character actually changes throughout the movie.  He starts out as an idealist and ends up worse than the people he had fought against.  Not a protagonist that gets OKed by production companies often.  Also, the timeline is cut up into flashbacks, making it harder to follow than a more linear story would have been.  And sorry, no happy ending either (spoiler alert?).  I think that is all rather brave stuff, even now.

If you've read this far, you get a high-five.

Yes, I do love the movie, but not because someone says I should.  I like it because it is a well-made movie that entertains and surprises me.

Don't like something just because it's popular, but don't dislike/discount something just because it's popular either.

793360,3,6304119046,"This movie has been praised for its use of light and shadow and the influence it has had on other filmmakers. Thats fine, but I want to see a movie with compelling characters and a compelling story. To me the story was only somewhat compelling and most of the characters were not all that interesting. Orson Welles himself is a far more interesting person than the one he portrayed. The one exception is the character played by Dorothy Comingore as the second Mrs. Kane, a woman who is forced by Welles William Randolf Hearst type character to become an opera singer even if she cant sing. In real life Comingore experienced the wrath of the real William Randolf Hearst who did not care for her portrayal of his mistress and with the help of Hedda Hopper and Walter Winchell managed to blacklist her, thereby destroying her acting career. She turned to alcohol and died in obscurity in 1971. It was probably due to Hearsts influence that the audience booed at the 1941 Academy Awards every time one of its nine nominations was announced. By the way, Comingore was pregnant when shooting began, a fact that Wells ingeniously hid with wardrobe and by shooting her behind tables.

Orson Welles makeup is terrific as he ages throughout the film; however, I thought two scenes in particular were contrived, one where Kane stands up and applauds the poor performance of his wife while everyone else has stopped clapping and the other is where he goes berserk and starts destroying Susans room after she leaves him. This is unfortunate because Welles got so involved in the scene that his hands actually bled.

 Welles said the story of Kane was an attack on an acquisitive society. One would think the Soviet Union would find this appealing but Welles noted that the Soviet Union, believing that the capitalist Kane was too sympathetic a figure, refused to show the film.

We don't learn until the last frame what Kanes dying word Rosebud meant and when we do, its rather disappointing. Even so, it is consistent with the theme of the story. By the way, since Kane died alone, how did anyone know Rosebud was his last word? Even Welles, when asked, could not answer that question.

Should you watch this movie if you haven't seen it? Yes, you should. This film broke all the rules and invented some new ones. But I think you're more likely to find yourself studying the film rather than being drawn in by the story and characters.",1476576000,2,2424,4.694117647058824

793404,5,6304119046,"I am the furthest thing from a movie snob and I avoided this movie for many years thinking that it would be boring, since so many movie critics love it (lol).  I finally took the plunge and discovered that Citizen Kane is a fascinating movie on many levels. It is one of the few movies that I want to watch multiple times.

To get the most out of the experience, I would highly recommend watching an extremely riveting documentary called, The Battle Over Citizen Kane first. This will give you some background on the businessman that the fictional Citizen Kane was inspired by...William Randolph Hearst. It's also helpful to know that this movie broke ground with its cinematography which is one of the main reasons it is considered ""the best movie of all time"". The visuals were used to help tell the story in a new and unique way. There are many articles online which discuss this in great depth which you might want to peruse before viewing so you can watch for some of these things.

This is probably the only movie in history where a film studio let a 25 year old novice director have complete control over everything... cast, music, script, camera, etc... This control no doubt gave the director/screen writer/star Orson Welles the ability to tell a story in a ground breaking way and his inexperience enabled him to be open to experimentation which resulted in numerous film innovations.

The mood of the music and atmosphere is haunting. The story itself is unforgettable especially the final scene which I won't give away. I encourage everybody to give this movie a chance!",1475020800,2,1582,4.741818181818182

793555,4,6304119046,"The Battle Over Citizen Kane, 1996 film

This tells about the battle between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst (the model for Charles Foster Kane). Welles had a contract with RKO. People talk about the past. Hearsts control of the press gave him power over people. [Most still believe what they read in a newspaper and don't understand how they are being fooled or manipulated. The National Association of Editors and Publishers still control the media.] It tells about Hearsts history. He owned the San Francisco Examiner and began to increase circulation. He attacked the Southern Pacific railroad on behalf of the people. Welles thrived on controversy. Welles staged a version of Macbeth set in Haiti. Welles staged Shakespeare plays that were more active. It tells about Marion Davies, an actress loved by Hearst (who was 52 with a wife and children)

Hearst did what he could do to increase circulation and profits. His spending showed his faults. The Great Depression curtailed his spending. Hearst attacked the New Deal; the Income Tax affected his behavior (higher marginal rates). Welles was ambitious when he came to Hollywood; he wanted complete control. [No mention as to who owned RKO Pictures.] Parts of Charles Foster Kanes life were based on Welles personal life. Hearst learned of the movie and tried to kill it. Hearst ran stories about previously censored events in Hollywood. Hearst complained about the use of foreign actors, immigrants or refugees from Europe. They tried to ban the movies in theaters (an oligopoly then). Welles was called a Communist or worse, the FBI investigated him as a security threat. Hearst papers promised a blacklist of any theater that showed it. Welles never again produced big pictures. He worked as an actor and put on weight from his excesses. He also acted in commercials.

This is a short biography of Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst. Both had flawed personalities, one was more powerful than the others. Should there be a law to prevent one man or corporation from owning or controlling so many newspapers? Yes. Power corrupts the person who has it (no oversight). That is also true for radio and television broadcast stations. But Wall Street may not agree. Even then the National Association of Editors and Publishers will still control the play in the news. What is best for the people? Distributed power is the working definition of democracy. The Filmography lists Orson Welles movies. Is the character in The Stranger similar to Harry Lime in The Third Man?",1466467200,,2537,5.035714285714286

793841,5,6304119046,"I about got what I expected. A superbly made film fit to match all the critical acclaim it received. It covers the life of our protagonist, Charles Kane loses his childhood early when his mother sends him off to live with a man who promises to turn him into a wealth successful man. From there it covers the themes of political scandals, possession vs love, struggles with morality, the what selflessness truly is, the price of failing at a great endeavor and the emptiness one feels toiling at a life of bitter, superfluous work that culminates in a very clever deconstruction of the American dream. If you think a film denouncing capitalistic endeavors and ambitious greed are too plentiful than you have to understand that very message was unheard of for the time. It still holds up to this day as a great film. I'm no expert at directing but I can tell the contrast of shadows in low light is done perfectly and wonderfully stylistic. The soul of this film is its character study of Kane and his complex of wishing to receive love without knowing how to give love. Yes you probably know the twist to the film, but just know that when I saw the reveal, and I thought hard about it, it was one of the greatest movie moments I'd ever witnessed. It serves as harsh, tearful stab to the gut when you realize how a lost chilshood can torment a man to eternity.

(There is a beauty to the lighting in those films that you can't achieve in color, although color does of course have different advantages.)  Most important, it's a great story.  It's funny and dark and sad.  Everything about it is clever and the casting is wonderful.  I understand why the pace seems slow to some now -- the pacing of many modern films borders on frenetic.  It tops the great film lists for reasons that aren't important to all viewers (the incredible tracking shots, the cinematography, etc.).

So, I was curious to know if I still felt the same way.  I do!  Let me make a few brief points about this film.  Sets/settings are important to any film.  The sets in this movie are poorly done..  Some of the buildings/settings are obviously drawn out; i.e. the newspaper location.  The character development is poorly done.  I still don't know what motivated Kane in most of the film.  I really believe this film is rated #1 for political reasons.  Everyone who knows anything about this film, knows it is patterned after the life of William Randolph Hearst, (through about 1941).  Hearst had been an admirer of Hitler before the War.  Earlier, around 1900, he had been a supporter of William Jennings Bryan, (a Democrat and populist), who was also an opponent of the theory of evolution.  Citizen Kane attacks Hearst for these political beliefs only.  Ranking the film #1 has nothing to do with the quality of the film.  It has much to do with Hearst political eccentricity, and strange personal life.  Citizen Kane is far from a great film!!",1449964800,2,1216,4.576744186046511

794546,5,6304119046,"Why lavish a 1080p, high-definition Blu-ray transfer and lossless DTS-HD Master Audio on an old, 1941, black-and-white movie in monaural sound?  More to the point, why lavish such attention on a movie that doesn't contain even a single gunshot, car chase, or explosion?  Because it's ""Citizen Kane.""

The question has never been whether ""Citizen Kane"" is one of the greatest films ever made; that's a given.  The question is whether it is THE greatest.  The American Film Institute thinks it is, voting it to their number-one spot.  Other such lists usually place it at least in the top five, usually at one, two, or three.  Not bad for a movie that failed in its initial theatrical run.  In any case, it's a self-recommending film, but I'm not here to tell you to buy it.  Let me just say I can't imagine anyone even remotely interested in the subject of film not buying it.  Warner Brothers give their ""70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition"" every advantage a classic movie of this stature should get:  newly remastered HD picture and sound, two full audio commentaries, a documentary as long as the film, a TV movie about the making of the film, and a ton of collectible material, all contained in a handsome three-disc package.

My late best friend, a professor of film, always used to say he thought people overrated ""Citizen Kane.""  Maybe.  I won't argue the point.  I first saw the film in the Fifties when I was still in my teens, and I must confess it didn't overly impress me.  Then I watched and studied it more seriously in a college film class in the early Sixties and began to see its worth.  Having owned several tape and CD copies of it and taught it to a number of film students over the years, I've come to agree with those critics who place it number one on their lists of all-time-great movies.  I certainly can't think of any film that deserves more respect or commands a more prominent spot in the history of film.

As everyone probably knows, cowriter, producer, and director Orson Welles based his story on the real publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst, his fictional character of Charles Foster Kane imitating pretty closely the personal and professional life of the famous newspaperman in rather unflattering terms.  The resemblance was so startling, in fact, that Hearst, who controlled a good number of the country's media outlets in 1941, tried everything he could to stop the public from ever seeing it.  The disc's accompanying documentary, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane,"" does a good job detailing the controversy surrounding Heart's attempts to suppress the film, which he made on a modest budget at RKO.  Heck, Hearst even tried to buy the negatives (with the help of a pal, MGM's Louis B. Mayer), and when that failed he refused to allow any of his own newspapers or radio stations to run ads for it.  By the time the film opened, to good reviews in non Hearst-owned outlets, the general public either believed it was a loser or didn't get a chance to see it at all thanks to its limited distribution.  It wouldn't be for another decade or two before people had the chance to reevaluate the film, and then it began appearing in art houses and college classrooms as a classic of the silver screen.

Obviously, people have written books on the merits of ""Citizen Kane.""  Let me just mention in passing that while it breaks little new ground, it does bring together a number of filmmaking techniques that had been in various stages of development previously.  For example, the movie refines the use of narrative point of view and flashback storytelling; emphasizes psychological lighting, light and shade (chiaroscuro), and deep-focus photography; embraces a sound track of amazingly wide dynamics for its time; provides frequent instances of overlapping and interruptive dialogue; employs complex and elaborate camera work, unique camera angles, abrupt cuts, multiple exposures, special effects, and dissolves; extensively uses mirrors, mirroring, and mirrored scenes and imagery; and utilizes many other examples of modern cinematography and storytelling in general.  The result is a cinematic tour de force that's just as dazzling to watch today as it was so long ago.  It's hard to dispute that it has influenced almost every filmmaker since its day.

Never mind that at age twenty-four this was Welles's first film, and that some people often criticize him for relying too much on the work of others without giving them entirely proper due.  Yes, famed cinematographer Gregg Toland did the amazing camera work and perfected the deep-focus photographic style, Bernard Herrmann did the musical score, and Herman J. Mankiewicz helped write the script, for which Welles gave them all due thanks in the credits.  But one cannot deny that this was Welles's baby from start to finish; and, besides, at this stage in the game, some seven decades later, what difference does it make who was responsible for it.  The point is that what we have is splendid, no matter who the collaborators were or how much they contributed.

But probably the movie's strongest claim to fame is that it tells a good story.  Covering Kane's life from childhood to deathbed, multiple recurring flashbacks look at the story from differing points of view, as a newspaper reporter tries to track down an angle on Kane's mysterious dying word, ""Rosebud.""  All of the characters, we come to realize, actually know the enigmatic Kane less well than they think.

Welles himself stars as Kane.  Welles was an actor, writer, director, producer, magician, and pitch man who was almost as complicated as the man he was playing.  Be that as it may or perhaps because of it, Welles puts in a first-rate, commanding performance as the poor boy left a fortune, who turned it into an empire ""the likes of which we shall probably never see again.""  For his supporting cast Welles chose largely players he already knew and had worked with before, many of them stage actors from his old Mercury Theater days, like Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead, Paul Stewart, and Ray Collins.  For the part of his mistress in the film, Welles chose Dorothy Comingore (pregnant at the time but nicely camouflaged) to play Susan Alexander, a role modeled on the real-life actress and Hearst mistress, Marion Davies.  Comingore may at first appear a bit superficial in the part, but she amply conveys the emptiness of a life filled with everything and nothing at the same time.

Possible Historical Spoiler:
According to an essay by Gore Vidal and to a trivia note at IMDb, ""Rosebud"" was William Randolph Hearst's pet name for the most-private part of his mistress, Marion Davies.  The use of the term as a plot device in the film enraged Hearst, which is probably why he tried to destroy both the film and Welles.  ""Hearst always suspected it was co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz who divulged this secret, since he had been a part of Hearst's and Davies' inner circle.""

Video:
What we've got here is a 2011, MPEG-4/AVC digital transfer on a dual-layer BD50, the movie restored from original nitrate elements in 4K resolution and remastered for Blu-ray in 1080p.  The results look better to me than the print I saw in a theater long ago, although here memory does not serve me so well.  One cannot find a blemish in this fresh, new transfer, which retains its original 1.37:1 theatrical aspect ratio.  What's more important, the black-and-white contrasts are startlingly vivid, with deep black levels and glowing whites.  Toland's photography keeps both background and foreground people and objects in crystal-clear focus, and any minor moments of softness go by almost unnoticed.  For all I know, the film probably never looked this good when RKO first showed it in motion-picture theaters.

Audio:
The monaural soundtrack, rendered via lossless DTS-HD Master Audio, sounds smoother now, particularly the dialogue, with a more-powerful dynamic range than ever.  After undergoing some apparent noise reduction, it sounds almost as clean and clear as the picture is sharp, with almost no discernible background hiss.  This is still not modern multichannel audio, but for 1941 it is as good as it gets.

Extras:
Warners' ""70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition"" includes not only the movie in high-def but a multitude of valuable bonus features on three discs, plus an assortment of collectible items.

Disc one contains the feature film in HD, accompanied by the choices of two audio commentaries.  The first is with film director and Welles biographer Peter Bogdanovich, who has spoken lovingly before on the subject of his hero and sometime mentor.  The second commentary is with film critic Roger Ebert, who spares us no apologies in his unabashed affection for the movie.  Both men supply knowledgeable insights, behind-the-scenes anecdotes, and revealing observations on the filmmaking process.  There's quite a difference between listening to an actor talking about an insignificant film and a pair of experts providing important information about one of the world's greatest films.  Bogdanovich, for example, tells us that Welles told him that many of the camera angles he and Toland worked out, so discussed and admired today as symbolic and meaningful, they produced simply because they looked good to Welles.  OK, so maybe the guy was just lucky; in any event, everything worked.  It's hard to make a choice between the two commentaries; I'd suggest if you have the time listening to both of them.  I found myself flipping back and forth; when one fellow would pause for a moment, I'd click over to the other.  That way I got to hear essentially what both men said about the same scenes.  Anyway, in addition to the commentaries, there are thirty scene selections; a theatrical trailer; English, Polish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Czech, and Romanian subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two, a standard-definition DVD, contains the 1995 PBS documentary, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane,"" which is almost as long at 113 minutes as the two-hour feature film itself.  The documentary, of course, chronicles the struggles between Hearst and Welles over the film and its content, two titans of their time in a clash of super egos.  Today, Hearst is a footnote, Welles a curiosity, and ""Citizen Kane"" a monument.  The movie outlives them both.  Warner Bros. present the documentary with chapter titles and English subtitles.

Disc three, also a standard-definition DVD, contains the Emmy and Golden Globe-winning 1999 movie ""RKO 281.""  It stars Liev Schreiber as Orson Welles, James Cromwell as William Randolph Hearst, Melanie Griffith as Marion Davies, John Malkovich as Herman Mankiewicz, and a host of other stars as the notable personalities in the story of the making of ""Citizen Kane.""  Warner Bros. present it in its native 1.78:1 television aspect ratio, with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound and several filmographies.

Among the additional items, there are the collectibles:  a twenty-page souvenir 1941 program reproduction; ten reproductions of studio memos and correspondence; a forty-eight page book with photos, storyboards, and behind-the-scenes info; and five one-sheet/lobby-card reproductions.  The three discs come housed in a handsome cardboard-and-plastic foldout Digipak container, it and the rest of the extras tucked into a strong, handsome cardboard slipcase.

Parting Thoughts:
I've read that the Academy Awards audience in 1942 hissed and booed the film's nine Oscar nominations--for Best Picture, Actor, Director, Writing, Art Direction, Cinematography, Film Editing, Scoring, and Sound Recording.  The film managed to win only for its screenplay, mainly, people surmise, because Mankiewicz co-wrote it with Welles.  The movie made Orson Welles forever a living legend, yet because of the movie's unwarranted notoriety he found himself also forever an outcast in Hollywood.

As an aside, William Randolph Hearst III, the old man's grandson, said in 1985 that he had always enjoyed ""Citizen Kane,"" and that he invited Welles to visit the Hearst Castle, San Simeon, anytime he pleased ""on my tab.""  I suppose time heals all wounds.  In the case of ""Citizen Kane,"" time has also helped improve upon a good thing.",1433030400,5,12306,5.081592039800995

794671,4,6304119046,"To begin with, Citizen Kane has to be one of the most successful cinematographic films ever made, with an utterly brilliant use of shadows, lighting, and technique  the deep focus technique mentioned in our handout. To that add the fascinating use of angles  the glorious early shot through a curve of the broken glass snowstorm ball, the trick of shooting below a person looking up to convey stature and dominance, and sets profound in size and lavishness. The editing is extraordinary too: what with the film jumping around from present to past and back, to inserted pseudo-newsreel footage and back to the characters, it is remarkable how easily the viewer can follow exactly what is going on. The opening of exterior shots of the mansion, Xanadu, is very striking and has the feel and music of what could easily be a horror thriller, and I think thats more than a little by design, as the film is essentially about a kind of monster, Charles Foster Kane.
The acting is excellent and I questioned none of the characters as presented, (although Wells Kane character walking around in a stupor toward the end was tiresome, it too was believable.) The film is very watchable, and I enjoyed it more than I did when I first saw it some 40 years ago, where its one unforgiveable flaw must have stood out to me as superseding the remarkable visual and acting achievements. Flaw? For all its ornate manipulation, this is an empty film. The Rosebud device works very well to move the story, yet, in the end, provides no resolution: Kanes true character remains as elusive and enigmatic as the ending. The reporters in the screening room made a commitment to tell the real story of Kane, yet, in the end, they fail, and their newsreels of the character and the actions we see him take in the movie are as close as were ever going to get. Kane is an engaging character, but not a great one, in the sense that we are never given any background that explains why and how he became such a shallow hypocrite, just as there is no explanation or motivation why he was so driven to collect and consume things or why a sled would stand so large in his memory as to be his last conscious thought. Finally, in short, no explanation of who this character is at all, which nevertheless makes it a good story, but just a story, and a truly great film, in my opinion, should go deeper.",1429574400,4,2363,4.557647058823529

795001,5,6304119046,"CITIZEN KANE is one of those films that often makes critics' top ten lists of the greatest films ever made, and has built quite a reputation as such over the 70+ years since it was released. It's also one of those films that people might be familiar with, but may not have seen. And until now, I hadn't actually seen it myself. So, does it live up to its reputation? Yes, it mostly does. The story, if somebody out there doesn't know, is about Charles Foster Kane, who is taken from his parents at a young age to live with a powerful businessman and, once he comes of age, takes over control of a newspaper. Over the course of his life, which is recounted almost entirely in flashback, you see a transition from an idealistic, principled young man to a reclusive shell of his former self. I thought it was a very well-written, well-shot film that gives a very balanced portrayal of a polarizing figure. All of the performances were excellent, especially Orson Welles, who was the brainchild behind this film. I also took notice of the incredible camerawork and cinematography which made effective use of light, shadow and space as well as some really sharp camera angles which provide visual insight into power dynamics that are an integral part of the story. However the most important aspect seems to have been a man who desperately wants love and approval, but doesn't know how to get it except by trying to buy it. It is this single part of Kane that makes him a compelling character, despite being such an enigma otherwise. There was also the film's central nagging question of what his final word, ""rosebud,"" meant. I thought that the answer, which is revealed in the film's final moments, was a bit underwhelming but extremely effective as a narrative-driving device. Overall, this is a classic film that deserves to be seen by all, if for no other reason than that it is an important part of film history.",1423958400,12,1913,4.646017699115045

795064,5,6304119046,"First things first, the BluRay disk is now cheaper than the simple DVD, so it's the one to choose.  The black and white film is not greatly affected by either definition standard.
Now to the film, this is a must-see/must-have for those who don't just love films but the whole genre of film-going.  The epic film made by auteur Orson Welles was intended to make a statement of megalomania, power, and the powers-that-be.  Supposedly about William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate, it was as much about the ego and megalomania of the director himself(Welles) than of anyone else.
The film is admittedly a masterpiece, with gigantic canvas murals of a life of wealth and power, increasing with each acquisition of a newspaper or famous journalist.  We see the personal life too.  It's not intended to be a pretty picture and it's not.  With great performances by Orson Welles himself, Joseph Cotton, and a small circle of regulars who worked for Welles and the studio, this movie keeps you watching to see how it will all end and what the mysterious 'Rosebud' (Kane's last words) referred to...

Be aware that the film is an intellectual and not an emotional adventure.  There is no catharsis..you never laugh, cry, or cringe.  Throughout the picture, you will note events and think how well staged they are.  That was good enough to put this film in the pantheon of great films, but whether you want to watch a great film that doesn't move you is another matter altogether.",1422748800,,1477,4.8023715415019765

The movie holds up really well under scrutiny.

What was really breathtaking was watching it with the kids. It caught the attention of our teenagers and at the end they seemed to 'get' it. For whatever reason when I told them ""this is the #1 movie of the 20th century"" they took notice but on another level I'm hopeful that they got the point that this titan, this larger than life man who had so much in life really just wanted that childhood innocence that he'd lost on that day. When I explained this to them, of course, they were politely attentive, but I'm not sure how much of it they ""got"".

795348,5,6304119046,"What else can be said about CITIZEN KANE that hasn't been already said? Some viewers describe it as the greatest movie of all time; others consider it rubbish. Produced by the wunderkind of the classical Hollywood era, the film incorporates most of the Mercury Theater cast who had spent most of their time working with Welles in New York.

Thematically speaking, it is an incredibly daring film for its time, in that it attacked precisely those forces of capitalism that drove the Hollywood studios. Like Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), the studios enjoyed a monopoly over the production and distribution of their products; and could distribute whatever forms of propaganda they wished. If we accept that CITIZEN KANE is in part based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, then the link between Hollywood and the newspapers becomes more pronounced, as Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), the would-be opera star who fails on her debut, is a fictional representation of Hearst's belle Marion Davies, who had an equally distinguished Hollywood career.

Welles' satire of the shallowness of capitalism is chiefly communicated through the interaction between Kane and his closest associate Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), who works closely with Kane on improving the circulation of the ""New York Inquirer,"" but soon realizes how Kane's judgment changes almost daily. The list of ""principles"" that Kane sets forth, when taking over the newspaper, become lost as the tycoon becomes more and more obsessive in his desire for power. In an important sequence, Kane opens an envelope sent by Leland, and finds the principles crumpled up inside, together with a torn check. Money, it seems, cannot buy everything.

What sets CITIZEN KANE apart from other movies is the complexity of its visual score. Gregg Toland's deep-focus photography is just magical, especially in the scenes taking place at Xanadu (Kane's residence), where the sheer size and scope of the property has been emphasized. There are some memorable shots - notably the image of Kane as reflected in a hall of mirrors, suggesting that nothing exists beneath the surface. Welles and Toland also achieve some memorable sequences shot from the floor upwards looking at the characters - a strategy that not only emphasizes their sheer size (and domination of the frame), but reinforces the film's major theme of the desire for power. Such shots are contrasted with the shots at the end, where the camera tracks backwards, focusing on Kane's possessions which become smaller and smaller and more and more insignificant as the shot continues. The film subsequently cuts to a shot of Xanadu with flames coming out of the chimney, emphasizing the total destruction of Kane's world.

The experience of watching CITIZEN KANE demands our attention; every sequence, it seems, is carefully structured, with a precise concern for lighting and scenic design. The cast are just brilliant; every actor, it seems, has been ideally cast for their roles. This is the kind of film that can be watched again and again; on each viewing, it seems, something new can be discovered.",1410825600,,3126,5.17193675889328

Many students do not immediately appreciate the movie--a lot of them say it's good but not the greatest film ever made, as its reputation would have them believe.  However, I think to truly appreciate KANE you have to watch it multiple times--there's simply so much going on, both in terms of story and technique, that you can't take it all in during a single viewing.  Every time I see the movie, I see something different or start thinking about things in a different light.

With people parroting the line ""Citizen Kane is the best movie ever,"" I had to think that this movie would be WAY better than this. I suppose that this movie broke all sorts of Hollywood conventions and rewrote the Hollywood rules with its creativity, but I've got to be honest in that I'd never know the difference, growing up in the 1980s and '90s. Now that any and all innovation has worn off, I've got to judge this movie purely on its plot, characters, acting, dialogue and just the nuts and bolts of whether this is a good movie or not......and it's not. So many of the performances are embarrassingly stagey and cheesy. They don't meet modern standards of good acting. The movie also had about seven plot lines, and Welles's portrayal of Kane failed to have any gravity and was unconvincing. Kane failed to strike an image of being good or bad, and this movie ended up saying nothing, except that this guy wanted his sled back, and I didn't even care about that. I also kind of object to the overall theme: that money won't buy you happiness. The movie seems like vague socialist propaganda, and I can think of worse things than getting rich.

The Blu ray copy of Kane is Glorious!! All the detailed work that Welles, Toland, the makeup artist, and set decorators contributed to his here for all the world to enjoy after those who created them have left us. This set includes the HBO film RKO 281, it is a short sometimes untrue, but very entertaining movie about Orson's making of Kane. The film stars Liev Shrieber, John Malkovich, (the Late Great) Roy Scheider, and James Cromwell as Hearst, all of whom are in top form. It is only 80mins long but a lot of fun and it adds to the aura that exists around Kane, definitely worth a watch. Also included is the Excellent documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane, 2 hours of fascinating details about the lives of Hearst & Welles and what happened when these Titans collided. It is a very entertaining, and informative film, which helps explain these 2 men without drawing conclusions, they give hints and facts and let the audience decide what the story really tells you about them. Also the film has 2 commentary tracks, and they are wildly different as you would expect from Roger Ebert and Welles Biographer and friend Peter Bogdonavich. Ebert is a movie nut and gives quick exciting stories and tidbits about the film, the actors and the influence of the picture, it is very enjoyable. Bogdonavich is much more outrageous and ""artsy"" for lack of a better word, he fills his commentary with second hand Welles tales, and more personal bits from Welles life, it is also very entertaining.

795763,5,6304119046,"Please note: This review is for the two-disc special edition of Citizen Kane.

Citizen Kane is one of the best movies I've ever watched but after all the reviews here it's hard for me to add anything new--at least to the reviews that rave about the picture, that is! The acting is superb and it should be noted that at least two prominent actors, Agnes Moorehead and Joseph Cotton, had their feature length film debut in this picture! Orson Welles doesn't simply act, he directs wonderfully and his contributions to the script (which were pretty significant) enhance the film greatly. (Herman J. Mankiewicz also wrote a fair amount of the script.)

I was particularly impressed with just how well certain camera techniques were employed in Citizen Kane. True, some of these techniques may have been used before but I doubt they were ever used so effectively up until this film was made. One technique that was in fact pioneered was ""deep focus;"" this is ""a technique that keeps every object in the foreground, center and background in simultaneous focus. This brought a sense of depth to the two-dimensional world of movies. (The Internet Movie Database)."" Another brilliant technique used in Citizen Kane is the way the camera often looks up at ""powerful"" figures like Kane and down at people like Susan Alexander Kane who is not exactly at her most powerful when she fights with Charles Foster Kane. I also liked the way they made it appear that Kane was addressing a crowd during a political campaign; while the filmmakers actually used a still photo of a crowd (with the camera appearing to look at a crowd from the rear), tiny holes were made in the photo and they used moving lights to make it seem as if the crowd were actually live--very clever indeed!

As for the storyline itself, the film shows us the life of political newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) in flashbacks that are somewhat nonlinear. The central character, Kane, is obviously based on political newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst and his life--there are too many similarities for this to be interpreted any other way. Ruth Warrick is exceptional as the first Mrs. Kane, Emily Monroe Norton, the niece of the president at the time Kane marries her (Hearst never married a president's niece--he just married a woman with the same last name as then-President Wilson). We see how that marriage progresses--and the second Mrs. Kane, Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), represents Hearst's mistress Marion Davies (Susan sings for her public just as Marion Davies acted in Hollywood for the public). Dorothy Comingore gives a fine performance opposite Orson Welles! There are other similarities between Kane and Hearst but I'll stop to avoid spoiling that part of the story for you!

Nevertheless, it's still well worth repeating what some others have noted: that the ""No Trespassing"" sign (at Xanadu, Kane's huge estate) shown at the very beginning and the end of the film is quite meaningful--just as the sign tells people to stay off the grounds of the estate, Charles Foster Kane lives his life staying away from other people--he doesn't ever truly learn how to love another selflessly and give to another without expecting something back as if he owned that person or group of people. The way Kane is robbed of a childhood with love and tender care from two parents sets him up for personal failure despite all the financial success he gains--and could possibly lose.

Look also for solid performances by Agnes Moorhead as Charles' mother Mary who sends him away at a tender age with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris) as his guardian; and Everett Sloane is wonderful as Mr. Bernstein. Ray Collins plays Kane's political opponent James W. Gettys and Erskine Sanford plays Herbert Carter. William Alland plays newspaper reporter Jerry Thompson (whose face is almost always completely in the shadows) and Paul Stewart plays Raymond, the head butler at Xanadu, Kane's huge estate. Harry Shannon has a brief role as Kane's father. Look closely and you'll see Alan Ladd as a reporter at the end of the film (he's smoking a pipe) and cinematographer Gregg Toland plays the interviewer in the 1935 newsreel. Nat ""King"" Cole has an uncredited role as the pianist at the El Rancho club.

This fine two DVD set comes with bonus features: the first DVD has short but very good footage of the premiere of Citizen Kane; I also liked the storyboards, photos and correspondence we get to see. The second DVD has an extensive and brilliant documentary entitled ""The Battle over Citizen Kane"" which, as Amazon notes above, explores the not so smooth relationship between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst.

Citizen Kane is a must-have for fans of the actors in this film and film aficionados everywhere. This is an example of American cinema at its very best.",1396742400,,4857,4.937576499388005

795886,4,6304119046,"Citizen Kane was a ""first"" movie in many ways--it was the first to use its special method of story telling, first to use sharp focus on all characters during filming, and probably the first to chronicle the life of someone still living at the time (even though the filmmakers vehemently denied that the movie was about anyone non-fictitious). Many directors claim that it was the best film ever made, for many reasons.  The question that was raised when we watched it, however, was ""Does the movie still hold together today?"" We were divided on this one.  I would say that if you haven't seen Citizen Kane, by all means, watch it as a museum piece.  Orson Welles was right when he called RKO Pictures ""the greatest train set"" that anyone could play with, and he plays with every toy in the box in this movie, from special effects to marching bands and dancing girls. But since this movie's production, so many of its elements have been copied so many times, and so well, that it seems dated in comparison with its successors.

795933,1,6304119046,"I, like many others, had heard this was the best film of all time, and like some others, I came away scratching my head.

  Let's start with the story. For me, the story has a fatal flaw in it. There is never an explanation as to why Mary Kane would turn over all the profits of the mine that she owned, to Charles when he turned 25. Surely, the same bank that managed the trust for Charles could have done the same thing for her? If she wanted to get Charlie away from his dad, couldn't she pay him the $50,000 a year allowance that the bank was paying both of them ( the mother and father ), to disappear? She could have moved east with Charlie and been involved with his upbringing, and things could have been much different for everybody in the film. Instead we get a situation that doesn't make any sense, so the rest of the movie can be made. Of course, it's also possible I missed the explanation, so if I did, can somebody enlighten me please?

  Next comes the acting. Joseph Cotton, who played Jedediah Leland, is completely unbelievable as a drunk, and as an old man. As i was watching both of those scenes, I was completely unconvinced. He looked like someone who was acting the part. Orson Wells also didn't do old real well, and the scene in the bedroom after Susan left him, he was completely underwhelming in. He looked like someone who was just walking around destroying things. Susan just left him. All his ""friends"" would know. He was just made a fool of. And nobody makes Charles Foster Kane look like a fool. He told us that in the hotel room right after Susan's opera debut. Remember, Susan wanted to quit because every paper in the city panned her, and Charles thundered"" I will not be made a fool of!"" In that scene, Orson showed real passion. In the bedroom scene, nothing. He just walked around, almost Frankenstein like, destroying things.

  Finally, I come to the camera work, specifically, the deep focus. I understand it was very innovative at the time, and the director of photography, Gregg Toland, did a great job shooting it. Technically, it was great. But it didn't add anything to the movie for me, and they were almost used as a club to beat the viewer over the head with. ""hey, something important is going on here, don't miss it!!!"" "" See Charlie way over there by the window as Bernstein and Thatcher sit at the desk talking about Kanes failing newspaper enterprise. That means he hates what money did to his life, and he's trying to do everything he can to get rid of it."" "" And see Charlie sitting way over there when he's talking to Susan about having a picnic. That means he doesn't really care about Susan.""

  The lighting on the other hand was much more subtle. When someones face went in to the shadows, It let me know something was going on there, but didn't broadcast what it was, at least not to me. After it happened a couple times, I finally got the feeling that that moment was when the person became meaningless to Charles, just a plaything to be used for amusement. I could be wrong there, it could mean something completely different, but that's what I got from it.

  All in all, these are the reasons this film failed to make a connection with me. Please, let me know how wrong I am. Thanks.",1393200000,6,3251,4.422110552763819

Quite honestly, it's nearly as criminal as the disrespect given to Welles and his people in various awards ceremonies, or the treatment from the public for well over a decade.

This is a five-star motion picture. This is a classic, a legend, and at some point may be regarded as a mythological creature. It has been parodied so many times that there are people who know some scenes yet could not tell you the origin. There are more uses of original techniques that are still used today in this film than ANY classic film the average adult can think of off of the top of their head. With a tad bit of historic perspective, one realizes that it's based somewhat on the real life of a media mogul (and, in reality, a number of once-ambitious human beings) and in some ways ways predicted the future of the star and director of the picture. It contains a top-notch internet meme, for crying out loud!

For the folks who give this one or two stars, I have two thoughts:

There are many more in-depth and better articulated reviews than I can offer; however, I've noticed that a lot of people don't seem to appreciate what is so special about this movie, noting that some elements seem trite or hackneyed, but what they might not know is that those Hollywood tropes originated in this film.  The cinematography, use of time/chronology, make-up etc. were groundbreaking and Orson Welles gives a hell of a performance. I try to imagine what it must have been like to screen Citizen Kane in 1941, never before having seen the flashback or actors aged so perfectly with makeup.  If you are looking to brush up on your film history and still see an enjoyable movie that spans the rags-to-riches life of a man, poignantly discussing that money and power cannot buy happiness or love, then it is certainly worth two hours of your life.

Why do we see movies? Is it simply for the entertainment and enjoyment value or because the technical aspects (acting, direction, etc.) were great? In short, for both reasons. But some movies only fall on one side of these categories. The art of filmmaking has many purposes. It can provide a cheerful and sensational escape from reality but it can also uphold a moral truth, show the consequences of a good or bad decision, depict history or illuminate the good, bad and ugly aspects of life. However most people see movies to be entertained or cheered up so when they come across a movie like Citizen Kane that doesn't even try to be cheerful, uplifting or entertaining, they don't know how to react.

Citizen Kane is a tragedy, and Charles is not a particularly likeable character but depressing stories with unlikeable characters are not worthless if they have a moral lesson. A tragedy with redeeming values can certainly be good. Herman Mankiewicz (screenwriter) obviously meant the movie to be a satirical, hard-hitting swipe at the shallowness and emptiness of the elite and he succeeds completely. His style of writing is brief, concise and to the point--not one line is wasted.
Charles manages to become the wealthiest man in America and a very powerful, influential person worldwide. Yet for all his prestige, he ruins the good life for himself with his own lousy choices. Just as he leaves his first wife Emily for Susan when he gets tired of her his second wife leaves him when she gets tired of him. He showers Susan with all the luxuries money can buy (just like Rhett Butler does to Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind) helps her get started on her career as an opera singer, sticks up for her when her music teacher gives her a hard time and tends to her when she is sick in bed. Yet she is shallow and selfish (again just like Scarlet) just as he was to Emily. His tearing up her room in a fit of rage when she leaves him and stopping to pause at the globe with the cottage reminiscent of his childhood home when he was young and innocent is a powerful depiction of the old saying ""What goes around comes around."" As his co-worker Jedidiah Leland says later on, he wanted everyone to love him. He kept sucking it up but was too selfish to give any of it to his family and friends. (With the possible exception of the examples of how treats Susan.) As a result he drove them all away and died a miserable man.
Orson Wells does an excellent job in the title role. He smoothly glides through all the stages of Charles' life--as an innocent cheerful young man, arrogant newspaper critic and corrupt politician.

All the other actors offer strong support especially Dorothy Comingore as Susan who slowly transforms from a sweet, likeable, down-to-earth young lady to a melodramatic, temperamental, annoying shrew.

Ruth Warrick as Emily, the first wife, doesn't have much to do but she looks absolutely beautiful especially in that white fur and silk dress in the blackmail/confrontation scene and proves a warm, sweet, lovely and endearing presence--heck, I would have chosen her over Susan in a heartbeat!

Much has been said about how the special cameras angles help enhance the storyline. I quite agree. My favorite parts were the up and down shots during the blackmail scene and the long shots going up and down on the stage during Susan's stage performance. The costumes and sets are luscious (especially Xanadu Palace) and should have won Oscars.
That being said, Citizen Kane is a depressing film and one I wouldn't see very often--maybe once a year. But it upholds a moral truth--that all the riches of the world cannot satisfy the heart or make up for having a bad character--and that's what makes it a great film. And it is unquestionably a great work of art.",1386547200,3,4291,4.879286694101509

796350,3,6304119046,"""The Greatest Film Ever"" is what many say about this film.  While it's true that it tops the AFI for American movies, followed by Casablanca and 3rd place The Godfather this film is not the greatest every time.  CK has been dethroned by movies like Tokyo Story or Vertigo in the ""Sight & Sounds"" which is the snuff movie guys favorite internationally respected poll.

While I recommend people watch this movie if you like movies, I also remind them that this is a movie from 1941.  This movie while amazingly done for its time, in this day and age of modern acting it would be considered a weak movie, with mediocre actors and a long-winded story that could have been done in a 45 min short.  But, we must remember this movie in it's time was very advanced compared to its peers.

As for me I don't consider this the best overall film, I do think is better than Casablanca or Gone with the Wind, there are many other later films are so much better like The Godfather or Dr. Zhivago.  I can put this movie in the double digits in my own list and will probably never top it.

I thought the story line was merely okay.  I imagine it had much more significance when it was originally made.  As I understand it, Kane was loosely based upon a real newspaper magnate of the time.  It is always nice to watch older cinematography, showing things that were new back then that we take for granted today.  Orson Wells did a fine job, and I enjoyed seeing how they aged the actors.

796494,4,6304119046,"I watched Citizen Kane a few nights ago and found it touching and sad; it reminded me entirely too much of people I've know and the life I lived for a few years. I've worked for a charismatic leader and followed him through the trials and tribulations of the business world; some of the scenes seemed much too familiar for comfort.

This is a sad, serious movie that dwells on the strengths and weaknesses of a strong leader and the impact of his decisions on the lives of those who followed him. I had no interest in the technical aspects of the movie and watched it without any thought but to simply experience this famous movie.

As I started writing this review I was reminded of the story of the individual who was to see the Mona Lisa for the first time and commented to the guard that he wanted to see if it was as good as everyone seemed to think and was told by the guard that the Mona Lisa wasn't on trial, he was. I feel as if I'm on trial as I write this review. Throwing caution to the wind I decided to go ahead and express my thoughts on the movie.

This is a somber, sad, movie that examines the life of a bigger than life individual who had a strong influence on the lives of those with whom he came in contact. I found it interesting, and provocative but will probably not want to watch it again for a long time, if ever.

Having worked for several years for a man who was similar to Kane in several ways, I found the movie disturbing and too personal.

It is a story that everyone should see at least once and I suspect that most will not share my experience and can view the movie with greater objectivity.

796501,5,6304119046,"One of the two best American movies ever to be denied the Best Picture Oscar, for decades Citizen Kane has occupied the all-time Top-10 lists of just about every film critics' organization on Earth. It is a genuine classic, an over-the-top, bravura debut by Orson Welles so full of innovations it has influenced the career of just about every moviemaker who's seen it. Beginning with a brief but now-famous prologue - in which the word ""Rosebud"" is uttered in a whisper by a pair of lips in ultra-close-up - it documents the rise and fall of fictional newspaper publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles), whose character is based loosely on real-life tycoon William Randolph Hearst. For that reason, the movie almost didn't get made - because Hearst made so many threats, legal and otherwise, against RKO, the studio of record. Welles, only 25 years old at the time, moves the story along effortlessly. Even this many years after its release, Citizen Kane remains full of surprises for first-time viewers, with a razor-sharp, Oscar-winning script by Herman Mankiewicz and Greg Toland's ground-breaking cinematography. As Welles once said - and demonstrated here - a movie studio is ""the best toy train set a boy ever had.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1380758400,,1488,5.830275229357798

There are no favorite parts of this classic; it starts fast, moves fast, and ends with the voice of a young boy who just wanted his childhood sled, the least expensive thing he probably ever had.

Years ago, watching this movie, had an effect on my own life.  I've never met a happy person who is also dirty, rotten, stinking wealthy.  They always want more, more, more and it can and has driven people to their own suicide or into a character anyone could see in another film: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

Like a perfect storm, all of that talent came together to give the world Citizen Kane, a story of the life of William Randolph Hearst so thinly disguised that Hearst spent a fortune trying to suppress the film.

Hearst's aversion to the mirror notwithstanding Citizen Kane is a complex account of a complex man. This restored edition is not just a tribute to Wells and his assembled cast and crew, but to the power of American film at its best. The ironic truth is  that Wells's own descent into self-parody is forecast by the life of Kane. History will see that he and Wells were birds of a feather.

Too many people said that it was the greatest movie ever, and when you go to watch it with that expectation, you can't help but feel disappointed.

I think people are more in love with the lore surrounding the movie rather than the actual film itself, which is a real chore to watch. The camera shots were interesting, the lighting was interesting, the FX makeup was well done, but the entertainment value was sorely lacking.

It's in the top ten all right -- top ten movies I wish I'd never wasted my time on.

797099,4,6304119046,"The brain-child of Orson Welles, Citizen Kane opens somewhat unimpressively, however it is certainly very moody and atmospheric. As the camera closes in on a great mansion we are given a first hand view of a dying man and his mysterious final word ""Rosebud."" In the following newsreel we learn the man was Charles Foster Kane (Welles), a millionaire tycoon and newspaper man. A journalist is enlisted to find out anything he can about Kane. He scours the memoirs of Kane's deceased childhood guardian. Then, he talks with Mr. Bernstein who worked with Kane's paper the Inquirer. He gets around to talking to Kane's unstable former friend Jedediah Leland as well as Kane's second wife. We learn from these accounts about his early years, his success with yellow journalism, the evolution of his first marriage, and the rise and fall of his political career. Furthermore, we find out about Kane's unhappy second marriage that ultimately left him loveless after looking for affection his whole life. Fittingly, we are again left with the bleak view of his fortress Xanadu and we now have the knowledge that ""Rosebud"" was in fact utterly trivial.

Obviously, Greg Toland's black and white cinematography using deep focus and low camera angles is wonderful. The framing of the narrative with different points of view and flashbacks was unique at the time. The actors age in front of us showing the progression of time and montage is used to effectively condense time. There is the overlapping and fragmentation of dialogue to create a realistic feel throughout the film. Bernard Hermann puts together a score that slowly changes along with Kane. And of course you have the supposed basis of Kane on William Randolph Hearst. Historically, Citizen Kane may in fact be the most important film and artistically it is certainly up there with the best of them. I will let others decide if that makes it the very best film, period.",1370044800,3,1919,4.9411764705882355

797193,5,6304119046,"This review is about the 70th Anniversary Blu-ray version (with book). The restoration and transfer to Blu-ray is quite excellent, especially given the age of the B&W film used from the archives. I found nothing objectionable with the gray scale, highlights or deep shadow. The audio is what it is -- good -- given the era in which the film was made. No objectionable extraneous clicks, pops or (especially) hiss. Don't expect the kind of high fidelity that current films have though -- ability to record that didn't exist when this film was made.

Don't underestimate the enormous power William Randolph Hearst had, even after the Great Depression had put a major dent in his news media empire, just before U.S. entry into WWII when this film was released. Hearst considered this film a personal affront and did everything he could to kill it ""with extreme prejudice."" It would have likely swept the Oscars had Hearst not launched an all-out attack on Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, severely damaging Welles' career permanently. Hearst tried first to kill the film before it ever saw the light of day. This included an offer to pay the studio, essentially a bribe, to not release it and destroy all the film's negatives and prints. Failing that, he then then limited theaters in which it showed by threatening to *permanently* refuse advertising in any of his newspapers for *any* theater that showed it. As a result, Citizen Kane did not open in New York in the theater it normally would have (the one the studio used for major film releases). For the Academy Awards, he heavily influenced Guild members as he controlled printed reviews of films, directors and actors.

""Citizen Kane"" is groundbreaking in its screenplay by Welles and Herman Mankiewicz (the older of the two Mankiewicz brothers), and in Toland's cinematography for which he and Welles had to invent equipment and create methods to achieve -- influencing many films, writers, cinematographers and directors that have followed. The story itself -- about the rise and fall of a very powerful megalomaniac's newspaper and radio station empire, that by self-proclamation allegedly fought for the rights of the ""Little Guy"" -- is compelling and the manner in which it's told on film is powerful. These are the reasons Citizen Kane has endured at the very top of the lists of all-time greatest feature films ever made . . . in spite of all Hearst's efforts to quash it.",1366156800,5,2431,4.912408759124087

Be as it may, the fact is that this DVD transfer is indeed quite different from that of this Blu-Ray edition. I found the latter much closer to the theatrical presentation, and may be a strong evidence that Mr. Graver was right.

What, on the other hand, I do miss in the box is the excellent BBC documentary titled The Complete Citizen Kane, aired in the early 1990's. And apparently this documentary has not been available elsewhere.",1366156800,2,775,4.776119402985074

I will say that Warner Bros. has done a loving HD transfer of Orson Welles debut, blacks are deep and the film is bright and crisp, with much more detail visable than in the previous DVD release.  The first shot through the Kane compound's fence, stark, showing the grain of its age, but clearly detailed, tells you right away what you are in for.

The supplements are carried over from the DVD with nothing new, but having the Roger Ebert commentary is worth the price alone. It rivals the best commentaries of Scorsese with its insight, detail, and obvious love of the film. The documentary included ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" offers nothing new, but for those unfamiliar with the film's backstory and Welle's struggles, it will no doubt provide some interest. As for the packaging, you are either a fan of the ""Digibook"" style or you aren't. I for one am, and the pictures, quotes and the like included in the book make a nice companion piece to the film.

Contrast appears to be off on my set up (which features an Oppo 103EU Multi Region BD player and a Samsung DLP Projector throwing a 14 foot 16:9 picture with this movie pillar boxed to 4:3 within.)

Sound is clear and the extras from early DVD releases make a reappearance although the amount of supplemental material is by no means exhaustive.

If you are buying the movie on Blu-ray for the first time and would like an attractive commemorative package then this will be adequate - certainly its a step up from previous home video releases in lesser formats. I still believe that one day a better attempt at transfer will correct the bright, contrasty picture, but until then enjoy a wonderful movie that is not only interesting but a mastercalss in movie making 101.

797286,5,6304119046,"About ""Citizen Kane"" (1941).....

Orson Welles was famously a self-promoter and opportunist of high skills and great gifts, and the widely accepted reputation of his movie ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) as ""the greatest movie ever made"" is due at least in part to his drum-beating, showmanship efforts over the decades to give the movie that label.

In fact, ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) is a tabloid type celebrity scandal story worthy of ""The National Inquirer"" tabloid newspaper and/or scandal magazine (the publication appeared in both forms over the many profitable decades it operated).

William Randolph Hearst (in the not too well disguised fictional persona of ""Charles Foster Kane"") is taken to task for having a pretty blonde unmarried ex-chorus girl mistress (Marion Davies named ""Susan Alexander"" in the movie), for living a life of profligate extravagance obviously both immoral and ridiculous, and for getting away with it all.....for living a life into advanced old age where he passes away, finally, in the care of uniformed nurses on duty at one of his mansions certainly as big as one of the Pope's summer palaces or any of French King Louis XIV's residential retreats.

In short, ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) ""dishes the dirt"" and wades through sleeze, sleeze, sleeze, all sanitized by the fact the sleeze is perpetrated by a person of wealth and power, a captain of industry of the sort demonized widely and often in the 1941 world then very much in love with Socialism and the philosophy of ""sharing the wealth,"" meaning robbing the rich and spreading assets of rich around for the ""poor"" to share and enjoy.

""Rich bad guys"" were very much in vogue in pre-WWII 1941 in the USA as targets for politicians and the media (the ""New Deal"" and Huey Long's ""Share The Wealth"" hustles were two of many examples of the times.....Upton Sinclair's California ""EPIC""....an initialism standing for ""End Poverty In California"" was yet another of fame in the 1930's...).

""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was a movie about a bad USA rich guy....tabloid stuff for sure.

It was presented using tried and true 1920's German art movie techniques of proved value...extreme close-ups, distorted angles, unusual and rarely used techniques of framing and scene changes.

""The Third Man"" (1949) is the other movie of fame and honor Orson Welles made while still a handsome young man (middle 30's in 1949), and it also used eccentric and honored German art film techniques to portray post WWII Vienna, Austria as the dark world of ""Harry Lime,"" the villain (another villain) Welles portrayed in ""The Third Man"" (1949).....

BTW, Welles was ""the third man"" referred to in the movie title, even though he was not officially given status as first billed movie star in ""The Third Man"" (1949)....Joseph Cotton was the ""official"" head movie star in that movie.

""Citizen Kane"" (1941) became a media event due to the efforts of Orson Welles to make it so, and his efforts continued decades after ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was released, and quickly forgotten by most people.

The retrospective (and in ways probably revisionist) history about the movie details....over the decades following 1941...tales of Louis B. Mayer offering almost one million dollars to burn the original negative before the movie is released, tales of the ""battle"" between then 76 year old Hearst and then 25 year old Welles, and blow-by-blow tales of how the movie ""almost never made it to the theaters"" and was ""disappeared"" after a brief release...

Welles became a movie star starting with ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), married Rita Hayworth, and was a mainstream Hollywood ""player"" during the 1940's and 1950's until his bad health and old age arrived early ended a not bad 20 year career in movies during which he was seen often on USA and world movie house screens.

He even became a player in the world of television, which displaced Hollywood movies by 1960.......who can forget the Orson Welles ""Paul Masson Wine"" TV ads promising the world that Masson wines would never reach wine customers ""before it's time""? ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was and is an OK black and white movie hard to enjoy the first time through which became a long range media event, and still is.

It is much more important as a media event and example of promotion and pop-scholarship than it is or was as a movie which stands on its own feet.

10 stars for ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) for it's place in ""the big picture""......not the same as 10 stars for being a good movie, pure and simple.

""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was never ""pure and simple.""

797479,5,6304119046,"Arguably the greatest of American films, Orson Welles's 1941 masterpiece, made when he was only 26, still unfurls like a dream and carries the viewer along the mysterious currents of time and memory to reach a mature (if ambiguous) conclusion: people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily. Welles plays newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. The result is that every well-meaning or tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event. Written by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz, and photographed by Gregg Toland, the film is the sum of Welles's awesome ambitions as an artist in Hollywood. He pushes the limits of then-available technology to create a true magic show, a visual and aural feast that almost seems to be rising up from a viewer's subconsciousness. As Kane, Welles even ushers in the influence of Bertolt Brecht on film acting. This is truly a one-of-a-kind work, and in many ways is still the most modern of modern films from the 20th century. --Tom Keogh",1357084800,,1154,4.8040201005025125

797702,5,6304119046,"I'm almost ashamed to say, I did not see this movie until well into my adult life. I do love movies and always wondered why this is at the top of everyone's ""best of"" lists.  My son is also growing to love ""old"" black-and-white films (because we tell him they are ""for grownups""), so we downloaded this from Amazon On Demand to watch together.  The HD print was awesome on our HDTV . . . this is a ""big"" movie but it was fine on our regular 42"" flatscreen. The movie, while not ""for kids"" in the traditional sense, was actually pretty interesting to my grade-schooler -- it does feature Kane as a child, in no small part, and tellingly my son's own questions (""where did his mom go? Is that man his friend now?"") managed to cut to the heart of the story itself! Not to mention the ending -- wow, did the two of us ever understand what ""Rosebud"" truly meant.

Orson Welles, if you only know him as an old man, was an astoundingly handsome and snappy young actor. Kane is a ""larger than life"" man who grew up wealthy, ""inside"" the establishment, but instead of following along and being a ""good fellow"" he pursues tabloid journalism -- both to be a thorn in the side of the establishment and to feed his own, ever-growing ego.  Along the road, he gets bigger and bigger while -- well, you might think you know where this kind of story always goes, but you have to see it to really feel HOW it gets there.  Welles hits every note perfectly. The film takes place mostly in flashbacks, which of course these days is par for the course, but (again with through a grade-schooler's eyes) the technique creates its own story of reminiscences, confusion and detachment from the past (""When is that? Who is that? Is he young or old?""). The big moments from Kane's life -- and there are huge ones, literally operatic -- ebb and flow through the (sad) reality of what his life ultimately became.  This movie is so big and bold -- the span of the story is bold, Charles Foster Kane's ambitions are bold, the sets are bold (this is one of the first films to show ceilings of indoor sets! It was an extravagance at the time because sound stages usually had no ceilings!) And, one of my favorite things about old movies -- it is a historic record in itself, a living singing picture of the world in 1941 -- an era of suits, cars, phones and city streets that are so different from ours. But when it comes to politics, news, ego and love (or ""love"") Citizen Kane still rings true -- and we have not come so far, after all.",1346976000,4,2504,4.339743589743589

797704,5,6304119046,"Recently I reviewed the 2011 Academy Award -winning film The Artist and commented in that review that the silent movie directors and producers of the 1920s (the actors I am not quite as sure of) would have given their eye-teeth (or at least their first born) to have had the technology available now back then to produce higher technical quality films. I am not so sure that I could say the same about director Orson Welles' 1941 film classic, Citizen Kane.

Oh sure some of the technical stuff today could (and has on the remastered versions ) enhance the sound, and  maybe some of the production values but this magnificent film does not rely on technical skill so much (although some of the scenes and backdrops are of high quality) as the driving plot line, the script, and above the acting of director Orson Welles's merry band of Mercury Theater players (think Joseph Cotton, Agnes Moorehead, Everett Sloan and, oh yes, Orson Welles, among others).

The plot line and the way it unfolds beginning with a clever news-of-the week video of Charles Foster Kane's life after he passed away to bring us  up to speed really is something to watch. Of course it did not hurt that this piece was a thinly-veiled portrait of the famed newspaperman and arch imperialist war-monger (the Spanish-American War and other little adventures be exact) William Randolph Hearst. He of ""yellow journalism"" fame although today he would be strictly minor league, maybe scandalous in Toledo or someplace like that.

Then to have the strong cinematic personality of actor Orson Welles (shown as well in other films like Falstaff, The Lady From Shang-hai, and The Third Man) play that strong Hearst personality just added to the drama. As well as did the flashbacks by various parties who knew Kane, had worked for Kane, had loved Kane, had hated Kane or were just pure baffled by him. And then that dramatic undercurrent throughout the film of Kane's characteristic that would banish him from the godly pantheon, his utter incapacity to love anybody but himself that left him alone at the end. Yet he was still able to go back into deep childhood to remember the good part of his life, the part many of us harken back to as we age. We all, or almost all, have our Rosebud memories and maybe that is the connecting thread to the continuing relevance of this classic film. Just make sure you don't go for popcorn or something out in the kitchen at the beginning of the film, okay. Trust me on that please.",1346716800,,2483,4.711981566820277

797708,5,6304119046,"Is it true?  The greatest? Well Citizen Kane certainly has the greatest reputation of all time. Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film, directed by and starring Orson Welles. Much of this film's accolades came from the era when it was released. Upon release Citizen Kane was a new kind of epic. Orson Welles utilized innovative cinematography techniques, music, and narrative structure to present this cinematic experience.  These innovations went on to affect every element of the film making industry. It is truly is a movie on a huge grand scale.  It's deep and it follows the entire life of a man. Citizen Kane is a fictional portrait of a famous American.  The famous main character is Charles Foster Kane who was played by Orson Welles. Kane is an immensely wealthy man that builds an empire.  He has everything yet he is only human.  He struggles with relationships, fame, responsibly, and emotion just like everyone else. The film explores many issues all humans experience in life. It is full of interesting quotes and could spur many philosophical conversations. Throughout the course of the film you really get a feel for what this characters life was like. Citizen Kane is a very thoughtful and meditative piece. You may not think it is the best movie of all time, but when you watch it you might wonder: could it be?

797821,5,6304119046,"I'm going to state something right upfront, and it's gonna be seen as snobby and uppity.  If you do not like character studies, black-n-white video, or stories that are always slow or, at best, on a low simmer, then you will most likely not enjoy this film at all.  So if you going to hate and be a troll about it, then go ahead and waste you time and life doing so.  Also, some people think this film is supposed to be a detailed and disguised bio-picture for the news-magnet William R. Hurst.  It is not.  The main character, Charles Foster Kane, has characteristics and a few parallels to the real-life Hurst, for sure, but the fictional character is his own unique voice and person.  Yes, Wells based parts of Kane on Hurst, but that does not mean they are equivalent.

Why do I enjoy Citizen Kane and think it worthy of being in my personal top-twenty film lists:

(1) I think the black-and-white cinematography is simply awesome in terms of eye-candy.  However, this type of candy isn't bad for your little gray cells.  Orson Wells, along with his team of film-makers, make this a perfect film to look at and get caught up into.  The spirit and tones it evokes are memorable to me, the two most outstanding ones being the Kane family log-cabin and the Kane mega-mansion Xanadu.

(2) Soundtrack is great, evocative, and moody, ranging up and down the scale.

(3) I actually like the character of Charles Foster Kane.  I find him interesting.  You see him boasting and standing on the  pinnacle of the world of success and power, and you also see him all the down the ladder to the stages of despair, rage, and despondency.  Basically, you actually see a normal human being in a unique position in life that most of us could only dream of achieving.

(4) It's quasi-historical.  It shows you an aspect of a time period of the world and the United States that seems to be left out or forgotten by most media.",1339372800,,1911,4.502906976744186

everything he could in Europe and had it built into his home.  The museum treats Hurst as a very
special man.

I know that he had a yellow journalistic and political side.  While there is no movie called Hurst
Citizen Kane is about Hurst, thinly disguised.  In spite of my motivation I just could not get into
it.  It really did not tell his story.  I don't know why it's such a classic.

If you are a man who identifies with the psychological aspects of the film, and this is your first time watching it, then ok, it is shocking in it's great insights.

797824,4,6304119046,"This is a 2-disc special edition, and I'm thinking maybe the special ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" is almost as interesting as the original movie. The point is made that this movie constituted a battle between two enormous egos, two enormously successful men: William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles. Hearst was old by that time, and Welles was young. Hearst's empire you know about. Welles had been amazingly successful in radio and producing plays in New York. He was signed to an unprecedented contract with RKO when he came to Hollywood in 1939. The script of ""Kane"" was leaked to Hearst, and a huge battle ensued. Interestingly, he was not nearly so upset about the film's portrayal of himself as of his second wife -- that is, Kane's second wife; I'm not sure Hearst ever married the woman he lived with who was represented by Kane's second wife. Hearst managed to have RKO stop distribution of the film, so it did not become known outside of art-film theaters and college film-making courses until much later.

The story opens with the death of Kane, and everything from there on is about reporters attempting to follow up on the mystery behind Kane's last word: ""Rosebud."" So there are interviews with the people who were important in Kane's life, and then flashbacks as they tell their stories. It's an effective way to tell a story which may have been original with this film. We are talking about a film released in 1941, after all. In fact, I think many things were either original to this film or developed into now-classic movie techniques by the film. For example, Kane gazes on a picture of the ""best of the best"" in his rival newspaper, which then morphs into a live grouping of the same men as they are being photographed upon their coming to work for Kane. Kane (Welles was a young and quite handsome man at the time) smiles and jokes charmingly over the fact that it took him six years to get what he wanted.

Another interesting technique is a series of identically staged scenes that come immediately after one close associate comments that Kane's first wife probably rarely saw him except at breakfast. They both get older and fatter, their clothes become more expensive and elaborate, the opulent conditions in which they have their breakfast are more and more opulent, and she becomes more and more nagging and shrill. So we know it's over time, and the strong impression is that she grew increasingly bitchy and he grew increasingly tired of her. Very effective story-telling for what probably only lasts two minutes.

There were enough differences between Hearst's life and Kane's that if he had wanted to, Welles could have fallen back on the old ""it's only fiction"" line in his battle with Hearst. But both were way too egotistical to allow any compromise. As the movie progresses, you can't help wondering who can be said to have won the battle in the long run.

I'm going along with the critics who have said this is one of the best films ever made, but a bit too serious and demanding of its audience to ever be one of the most popular.",1337385600,2,3070,4.690166975881262

A nurse enters the room and is viewed through the leftover shards and contents of the glass ball on the floor. Nothing in any film up to that point had ever thought of such a cinematic touch. Genius.

2) A woman is screaming at Kane as he desends a staircase, he opens the front door and a car horn sound mingles with and replaces the screaming. Blue my mind!

3) Camera is placed underneath the floor, we look up at Kane, from shoes to head. Exciting extreme angle.

4) In Kanes' pleasure dome, a new scene begins with a cockatoo screaching in close-up, flying away. The body of the bird did not seem solid, I thought I could see though it. Shocking sensation.

My copy of the standard disc upscales very well in 1080p on my blu-ray player and while the picture quality is very good and bright, there are still very faint white spots in some frames for example in the scene where the reporter is reviewing the manuscript in the vault.  The sound quality is also good there but this blu ray version has a vastly superior sound quality coming in DTS mono.  The strange thing is that when it comes to the picture quality, the blu-ray shows a lot more grain when compared with the vault scene in the standard version and while the white spots are virtually a thing of the past, the lighting is pretty dark and at the end when the reporters leave Xanadu, you can hardly see a thing on the blu-ray while you can still make out the faces on the upscaled standard disc.  As the second disc on the ""Battle for Citizen Kane"" is virtually identical to the one on the standard release there is nothing to compare among the two here.  The booklet packaging with the colour photos and pages is nice but other than that, there is nothing really to distinguish between the blu-ray and the standard dvd release.

Better sound quality but arguably slightly better picture quality when compared to the upscaled standard disc and equal special features except for the better blu-ray book packaging makes it a tough call on whether or not to double dip.

798055,5,6304119046,"Considered by many to be the greatest American film of all time, it's taken me nearly 10 years to see it again.  I had been contemplating replacing my ""remastered"" 60th anniversary edition with the Blu ray version.  Being an active collector of films, this is a decision that comes up often.  When it comes to video tape and even laser discs, it's a pretty easy decision.  But should you automatically upgrade your DVD's to Blu ray.  If you have a limited budget, the answer isn't always yes.

 I can add little to the evaluations of thousands of critics, both professional and amateur, regarding the quality of the film itself.  While watching it this time around, I was amazed at the time and effort given to the makeup.  Several characters in the film including Orson Welles' Charles Foster Kane, age over several decades as the reporter allows them to reminisce in a series of flashbacks.  Given the technology of 1940, the art is at its highest in this film.  Kane in fact, begins the film as a dying old man, but the story quickly reverts to his time as a boy growing up in Colorado.  His parents decide that he should grow up in a more cultured environment so they send him off to boarding school after the discovery of silver on their property.  Eventually Kane becomes involved in newspaper publishing which leads to great wealth and politics.  The last words Kane spoke as he slipped away was ""Rosebud"".  The reporter is charged with discovering who or what Rosebud was.  This leads to the various interviews with important people in Kane's life.  Technically and artistically the film is a marvel.  The acting is top notch and all performers came from Welles' Mercury troupe.  In particular look for an excellent performance from Dorothy Comingore as Kane's second wife, singer Susan Alexander.  She has a wide range in emotions to portray in addition to various chronological ages.

This edition of ""Citizen Kane"" includes the documentary ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" which is a fascinating film itself.  It was no secret Welles was using William Randolph Hearst as his model for Kane and California's San Simeon for Florida's Xanadu.  Hearst wasn't happy about it and did all he could to destroy the film and Welles.  I watched the DVD on a Blu ray player that upconverts/upscales the DVD to ""near Blu ray"" quality.  Does it?  Well, the operative word is ""near"" and for me and for this remastered, black and white, mono audio film, its close enough.",1323043200,,2464,4.76595744680851
798056,5,6304119046,"I heard M Night Shamalan was great at twist endings, but he really proves it with this one!  In this classic, he starts off with the mystery of ""Who is Rosebud?""  The story goes on for a long time building solid characters and slowly filling in the life of Kane.

***Spoiler alert***

Then after building everything up (especially suspense) we find out from Kevin Spacey that Rosebud is Keyser Soze.  Man that cop never saw it coming.  And the way that the falling coffee cup with Kobayashi on the bottom smashes, just like the snow globe:  BRILLIANT!  I watched it several times just to piece everything together.  It wasn't until the third viewing I caught that Brad Pitt and Ed Norton were, in fact, the same person who was terribly allergic to water.

Like all timeless classics, age has not withered its potency, and 70 years later it is as relevant as ever and absolutely just as moving as it no doubt was back in 1941.

Blu Ray-wise, it's even better. Movies this old should not look this good. It just doesn't seem right, and yet, here it is - presented absolutely perfectly without the tiniest flicker or grain, in stunning STUNNING 1080p that gives incredible details to old coats, snow flurries, mansions, facial expressions.. and, well, every single shot. It's glossy all the way throughout. This is NOT a low budget restoration, it's a transformation like no generation has yet to experience. If you think Blu Ray can only enhance modern, color spectacles, watch this movie. You will be proven wrong. In fact, some of my all-time favorite blu rays to show off my 1080p television are Black and White.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca-BLU-RAY/dp/B000Q6GX8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca [BLU-RAY</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Zone-Blu-ray/dp/B003JBI3GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Zone [Blu-ray</a>] are just some examples that dazzle a high definition screen. Citizen Kane is among the best, if not THE best, however, and has set the bar even higher. I'm so happy that this release was taken seriously.

OVERALL: If you're a fan of this classic or have never seen it before, buy or rent this movie on blu ray.

798176,5,6304119046,"There is little to say about a film whose genius needs little analysis. Welles' mock[ing]-""biography"" of William Randolph Hearst is an attack on just about everything wrong with this country. Nothing has changed in 70 years, and ""Kane"" remains an indictment of our vulgar, grossly materialistic society. It is also an extremely entertaining -- and yes, fun -- film that holds your interest from beginning to end. The last 30 seconds -- among the most-famous in film history -- ought to make any halfway rational person seriously question what they're doing with their lives. (The ""Kane"" theme is a variation on the ""Dies Irae"".)

Is it really the best movie ever made? I can only answer that with another question -- what film would replace it for #1? When ""People"" magazine selected the 100 greatest films more than a decade ago, ""Kane"" was #2, behind ""The Godfather"". As great as Coppola's masterpiece is, it lacks the ""startle factor"" of ""Kane"". Even by modern standards, ""Kane""'s screenplay, cinematography, and non-linear (but easily grasped) structure remain remarkable. Reviewers said they'd never seen anything like it, and in an age of boring, overwrought CGI extravaganzas, ""Kane"" remains unique. No one has quite caught up with it. *

'til now, the best transfer was the DVD of a few years back (apparently from the composite negative), a big improvement over the previous transfers from prints. This is probably from the same source, but scanned at 4K. Whether you should replace that copy depends on how big your set is, how close you sit, and the quality of the scaler in your BD player. All I can say is that I've never enjoyed the film so much.

The only thing that would get me to buy yet another edition (I still have the Criterion LV) is a restoration of the soundtrack. If the dialog and effects stems still exist (and they probably do), it would be nothing more than a matter of finding the money to re-record Bernard Herrmann's score in modern surround sound. With a bit of amplitude and phase EQ to the dialog, ""Citizen Kane"" would emerge even better than the original.

* Since writing this, I've thought of two films that can truly stand comparison with ""Citizen Kane"" -- ""Chinatown"" and ""L. A. Confidential"". Both are among the finest films I've seen, and reward repeated viewing.",1316304000,4,2306,4.845177664974619

I also A-B compared it to a previous DVD special edition, and I don't find the resolution of the film much improved in the Blu Ray version.

The five star reviews are from those who are either old enough to remember the film when it was new, fresh and incredibly important because of its innovations in film-making, or can enjoy a movie for how it influenced the film-making process since its release. The one star reviews are from the young who simply can't see what the fuss is about for an 'old' film which, of course, technically does not compare to the CGI and effects processes available to film-makers today. No ""rush"" to be had except from thought - but why should a movie involve cognitive work as movies are just for entertainment? Right? The best movie of all time? To make this distinction does NOT involve comparing it to a modern film one on one for technical values, acting, etc because you simply can not do that. Apples to elephants so to speak. But how the film influences the medium, relates to its ""then"" surroundings, shows innovation - all these reflect the greatness of a film. And it is hard to fault Citizen Kane on these grounds. An audience member's personal liking for the subject matter of a film can not be used to properly rate a film, except for a rating of that person's experience. If a person individually does not like a film, it does not accurately reflect the film's effect on any other person - nor its importance in the scheme of things.

But this film held their attention and they had plenty of questions about it.  I regard this as a mini-triumph, but then, it is easier to do with a film that is this good.

For myself, it was also an almost completely new viewing experience:  this time, rather than a personal history about the loss of love, I saw it from an historical perspective that I lacked as a youth.  In that way, with the overt references to WR Hearst - the rise of yellow journalism, overt meddling in politics and even international relations, and the manufacture of news - it was doubly fascinating for all of us.

Still, the sadness of Kane's plight comes through with perfect clarity, indeed as perfect drama.  It utterly riveted me, was even painful to watch most of the time.  I even liked the level of psychological depth in all the characters.  Not to exaggerate, but I found it as complex an experience as one would expect from Shakespeare.

He would put the camera in places never before imagined, he would cut into the stage to get low shots, he understood depth of field and panning through those depths and countless other techniques that made great use of visual story telling.  On top of that, he understood story from a Theatrical/dramatic point of view.  Welles understood the medium of film from A to Z, top to bottom, inside and out, period and he shows it in this movie.

Atop the AFI's 100 Greatest Films of American Cinema is an amazing & prestigious accomplishment, but it also puts a negative light on the film because it means that people should have expectations for it that are so high it is ridiculous. Everyone approaches it, almost randomly, as the greatest film of all time, & then is disappointed only because they thought it would be better.

People must consider the time period in which this film was made & realize what a film of influence & importance this was. Innovative cinematography, as well as great music & very unique narrative structure. It is more than groundbreaking because it has had such an effect on cinema.

The greatest film of all time: No.  Interesting satire on a long forgotten power monger?--Yes.
But not the classic film of all time.  And I am an Orson Welles viewer; and this is not one of my favourite films that he made.  Now the Invasion from Mars radio stunt: A classic! to end all classic manipulations.  And a revealing insight into the minds of some Americans at the time.  Not funny, if you were one of the people who became injured in the panic.  Otherwise, a classic national prank that made the rest look like idiots.
The Ambersons was butchered, so we'll never know what that was meant to be; but it still gets 4 stars by all the critics.
Oddly, Citizen Cane was the breaking of Welles as a film maker. So hyped as time passed, he couldn't live up to the hype.  If the film was rationally viewed, he may have had less expected of him.

If however, you are watching a movie for narrative and because you want to care about the characters, then this movie will leave you cold.  I can't help feeling that anyone who likes this movie is pretentious and only raves about this movie because it makes them appear somehow knowledgeable.  I fear that, like most critics, people who can 'see' something wonderful and profound in this movie only want to raise themselves above the masses and don't truly enjoy this debacle, for how could anyone enjoy a movie filled with obnoxious characters that has a protracted story with no compelling elements?

My family sat in dismay awaiting the wonders of this movie after it garnered so many critical reviews extolling its virtues and rating it the greatest movie ever made.  We were sadly disappointed.  My dad fell asleep; my sister--who has done media studies--couldn't handle it and left after less than an hour, and my mom & I sat in agony awaiting some magnificent event or epiphany that would allow us to see why people raved about this movie.  Alas, it never happened, and when it finished, we were just left thanking God that it was over.

I can easily rate this as one of the worst movies of all time, and it's a truly excruciating experience having to watch this.  I think they could inflict this movie on prisoners at Guantanamo bay to get them to talk.

It's worth noting that this movie bombed when it was released, and it was only subsequent views years later that people started to profess its virtues.  Technically, maybe yes.  Characterization and story line?  Snoozeville and, as stated, sheer agony to watch.",1305763200,7,1735,4.820945945945946

If you're asking why I was dreading seeing this film, it is because to date I am not keen on older things. Besides my lack of interest in black and white films, admittedly I find books and music from my parent's youth to be of little relevance. However, I still went ahead and watched Citizen Kane with an open mind.

I was unable to watch this film in one sitting, because I kept falling asleep near the twenty minute mark. By the third time I was finally able to finish it.. I was completely underwhelmed, and actually disgusted. Disgusted with all the praise it has acquired, disgusted by the lack of action, disgusted by how much Orson Welles was consumed with his own ego and pretension. In simplest terms, Citizen Kane is outdated babble, trying to convey a message but only coming out as empty talk, where it's only value lies in nostaglia (like ""Pulp Fiction"".)

It's a thorough, unbiased glimpse into both men's lifestyles, triumphs, mistakes and defining moments. The documentary is a bit on the long side, but in retrospect I can't imagine which slab of material could've been sliced away. It's all integral to the big picture. Considering all that led up to it and everything that worked against it, it's something of a miracle this film ever saw the light of day.

798358,3,6304119046,"Stylistically, you can probably go to your local theater today and see something done in one of the movies that is directly inspired by (or in a lot of cases, directly stolen from) Citizen Kane.  The same has probably been true for many of the better movies ever made since this one came out.  It is worshiped by every critic, director, producer and actor out there.

So why do people hate it so?  Simple.  It's because it's all style and no substance.  While something can be found in most every great movie that you can connect to, it's just not there in this movie.  Like everyone else, I saw all the movie lists and wondered what it is about this movie that people liked so much.  But watching it left me wondering that much more.  It just doesn't draw the viewer in.  The interviewees are all wooden and predictable, and Welles himself is just someone with an enormous ego playing...someone with an enormous ego.  I didn't feel for Kane, I didn't relate to him and in the end I just didn't care.

To this day, the greatest danger in making or watching an ""Oscar-worthy"" film is mixing enough style in with the substance.  In most cases, there is a failure with that; it's usually too heavy on style and pretense to support the substance.  Citizen Kane, to me, is the perfect example of how soul-less Oscar-worthy films can be.  Part of it is that Kane was, in the end, soulless, but it didn't get there without a lot of help.  It's impossible not to appreciate everything it's done for film-making since, but that is not enough of a reason for me, at least, to consider this in my top ten.",1302480000,4,1594,4.444827586206896

The bad: It drags in some places and the can be boring at times.

But:

1) The movie, 70 years old, is often slow by modern standards.  It wasn't until about halfway through that I started catching on to why so many call it the best movie of all time.  But this criticism is not that important, and if it were my only one I'd still give the film five stars.

2) My big beef:  The film is utterly NON-redemptive.  Although it is brilliant in showing the problem, it does absolutely nothing to suggest, let alone show, a solution -- or even a suggestion that a solution is possible.  I suspect this is because Orson Welles had no realistic idea of how to heal childhood traumas.  For that reason I cannot give the film any more than three stars.",1293840000,2,955,4.52046783625731

I'm only 22, so if you are a bit older than me, you may love it-- from the reviews it seems that most people do-- but I just can't see any one in my generation actually appreciating it.",1292716800,,563,4.081081081081081
798442,4,6304119046,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

It's difficult criticizing a movie that's hailed as the greatest movie of all time. From the standpoint of cinematography, it might just deserve all the accolades that have been heaped upon it all these years. But my specific bone to pick with Citizen Kane is a story line that kind of runs out of gas.

Orson Welles said that 'Kane' was not specifically about William Randolph Hearst but represents a sort of composite portrait of the rise and fall of a prominent American in the public eye. But one can see clearly that Welles had it in for Hearst. So much of the first half of the movie (up until the midpoint) is reminiscent of Hearst. And indeed it is the most compelling part of the picture. Up until half-way through Kane we feel that Welles is really being fair to his Kane-Hearst character who's depicted as charming but also capable of acts of megalomania. It's this multi-dimensional portrait throughout the first half that really grips our attention. Plot wise the stakes are raised until Kane's thunderous fall from grace when he's caught in a ""love nest"" with the ""singer"". This is the setup for the second half of Act 2 of the script leading to the 'point of no return' when Kane flips out after his second wife leaves him.

Welles was faced with a big problem in the second half of his script--what to do with main character? The first half is so believable because it is based on the events of a real person's life. But when Welles looked to Hearst for inspiration for the second half of his movie, there really were few compelling conflicts LEFT for him to latch on to. In real life, Hearst continued to publish his newspaper, was sort of a recluse who didn't reveal much about his private life and did NOT have a bad relationship with the woman who he was involved with (in contrast to the relationship between the fictional Susan Alexander and Charles Foster Kane). So what did Welles do? He decided to create a false portrait of Hearst, a veritable straw man, which he could easily shoot down. Welles, the Hollywood 'progressive' now went into battle as the standard bearer, slaying the 'reactionary' Hearst. Kane-Hearst loses his charm and basically becomes almost completely unlikable in the second half of the movie. Welles grafts a 'character flaw' on to Kane-Hearst based on a man named McCormick, a Chicago heir who promoted the singing career of his no-talent mistress which is reflected in the Susan Alexander Kane story arc.

By falsely depicting Kane-Hearst as a violent man obsessed with trivial pursuits, we no longer see a character who is multi-faceted. This is Welles deceiving himself that he's 'better' than William Randolph Hearst (despite Welles's disingenuous claims that the character was not really based on Hearst.)

Citizen Kane is really the harbinger of things to come for Orson Welles's career--a career that ran the gamut from profound inspiration to adolescent narcissism. Technically Citizen Kane was probably the greatest film ever made and full of sensational performances. But at the same time Welles's elitist point of view and simple inability to follow through to complete a story full of great promise diminishes the overall impact (in small measure) of an American classic.",1292112000,2,3274,4.860215053763441
798443,5,6304119046,"I was unsure at first about watching this movie. I asked a friend about this film and he sid that it was one of his favorite movies. Since my friend and I have the same taste in movies for the most part, I gave this movie a chance and I am glad I did. This movie is very moving in the tale of the life of Charles Foster Kane and the search of his last word ""Rosebud"". Orson Welles takes on a journey of the people that were in Charles life and the stories they had of Charles. It is not until the very final scene you find out about Rosebud.

The filming was outstanding, the directing above the rest and the cast was incredible. Citizen Kane is one of the greatest motion picutres that I have ever seen and will have to own very soon.",1290556800,,735,4.034246575342466

You can watch the movie a hundred times and see something new each time.  The most famous aspects of the movie, of course, are the cinematographic tricks that Welles and camera man Greg Toland use:  cameras that enter through windows, doors, skylights; shots from floor level looking up at the characters;  degraded film to represent newsreels;  flashbacks, flash forwards, composition where everything in the shot is in focus and of course the famous payoff shot at the end, when we find out what 'Rosebud' represents.

I would say that this is certainly not the most entertaining movie ever made, but you have to be impressed w/ the inventiveness and incredible visual effects that this movie achieved.  Of course it's a must-see movie and probably should be watched several times.",1284940800,,889,5.0
798445,5,6304119046,"Whenever people start proclaiming something 'the greatest ever', I always get a bit wary. One, because hype is usually, well, based on hype and not fact, and it eventually becomes self-sustaining (ie people jump on the bandwagon of acclaiming something, just because they feel all the 'critics' have done so). Two, because even if it isn't overblown too much, I am usually disappointed when I had my hopes in the sky.

'Citizen Kane', well, I think it's hard to make its case as the greatest movie ever made, but it *is* Damn good. Do yourself a favor, and don't just watch it once, pass judgment, and reference it to your friends every once and a while just so you can feel Cultured. Actually THINK about this movie. ^-^ I promise you it's worth your time. I watched the documentary about it, read various reviews/essays about it, then re-watched it...only then did its scope truly sink in. ""Gee,"" I can hear you saying. ""Shouldn't something truly Great strike you the first instant you see it?"" Yes, I agree, but truly great things also require digestion. This movie is Good upon first viewing, and becomes Great when you give it the time it deserves.

Quite apart from the movie, the story behind how it was made was also larger than life. Do yourself another favor, and read up about the Orson Welles - William Rudolph Hearst clash. It's Fascinating, and sheds another layer of light on this fantastic film.

The acting is superb and is wonderfully restored from the highest quality surviving elements. The movie starts out with a newsreel. The second disc contains a documentary titled The Battle over Citizen Kane, and that is definitely worth a look as well. Two thumbs up....WAY UP to Mr. Welles and the rest of the cast as well.",1281052800,,596,4.579439252336448

798450,5,6304119046,"For all my reviews visit my website [...]

I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movie unless otherwise stated.

Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.

Excuse me, I was extremely sick while I was watching this movie and I couldn't pay as much attention as I usually could.

So anyways, how do I feel it is innovative? Most people say it is for the shots, which, definably it is. For a B&W film, it's absolutely beautiful. Everything is so craft fully filmed. The moving shots going up and down, just everything is beyond words for the shooting.  It's the work on genius on it's shots, it planted the ultimate apple tree seed for the farmers of tomorrow to eat from and plant more seeds. See my symbolism?

And that's another way I think this was extremely innovative, symbolism. This was obviously done before, some of the all time greatest and favorite films before this were King Kong, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, Werewolf of London, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Nosferatu, The Phantom of the Opera, Hunchback of Notre Dame (you can see I love horror movies of that time,) but all those wonderful titles of which I have not reviewed on this site all show symoblism in something of fantasy. A giant gorilla, a vampire, a zombie mummy, a werewolf, a shape shifter, a phantom, some of them were real but are outcasts, and thus were not seen very much at the time. Citizen Kane however, delivers the symbolism in a factor of the human perspective. There's also much more of it, in Frankenstein, the whole plot is one point of symbolism, however, this carries out like a book with multiple symbols in addition to that type. I haven't really explained it have I? You would haft to see it for yourself, which I highly recommend.

The scripting is very awesome. The idea of doing something, again, so familiar to us, is pure genius. Making it work so well. They didn't just flat out go flat, like some people these days do. But, they really did put the candy on the apple. They were also aware to make sure the candy stayed on the apple and not become it's own candy but to stay with the apple. Am I still symbolic or am I just a maniac? Oh, I haven't even talked about the greatest of things. It's done between two stories, the story of Charles Foster Kane is told through stories from his friends, and a newsreel. At the same time, we try to find out what his dying words ""Rosebud"" mean in the time after his death. So, they tell two stories at once. You pick any masterpiece from well, anytime but especially that time, you will probably not find that innovation. And you never really find out what Rosebud means until the end of the movie, and then, it's still done extremely symbolic and discreet.

So, this is extremely innovative. Probably one of the top 10 innovative movies of all time. I'd say, a collection of opinions would say that these movies are the top greatest not in a specific order. Citizen Kane, King Kong (1933), Transformers (1986), Jason and the Argonauts, Casablanca, Cloverfield, Alien, Godzilla (1954) and Frankenstein (1931).

So what is the rating? As an innovative picture and part of history, it by far deserves a 6/5. However, past the innovation, to an naive view, I'd say 4/5. Take it up to 5/5 between the two. I, Da Ca$hman signing off.",1277078400,,3392,4.547540983606558

[The allure of Citizen Kane has persisted through the changing of cinematic technique and style. Although full of technical innovation and revolutionary for its time, its unshakable position as the `greatest movie of all time' cannot be attributed solely to the technical genius of Orson Welles. His use of special effects was inventive, and showed clear influence from Welles' experience as a magician. In addition to its use of special effects, Citizen Kane was also groundbreaking for its addition of meaning to existing cinematic and editing techniques.] author Alvin Lin

This is perhaps one of the most well known opening lines to any film, and it comes from an appropriate source.  Orson Welles's Citizen Kane.  On may be surprised to learn however, that a film long considered on of the greatest films of all time wasn't a hit when it was first released.  In fact, released in 1941, the film was not a cultural marker of its time.  In an era beset with stress and the harsh realizations of reality, the general audience demanded a lighter fare in their movie-going experience.  The musicals of MGM were big at the time, and it wasn't until Welles own The Stranger was released in 1946 that he reached a mass audience.  However well received The Stranger was, Welles despised it, calling it his worst picture ever.

Citizen Kane only received lukewarm reception from the public.  The critics immediately hailed Welles as a genius, and the worst reviews rated Citizen Kane as a masterwork of their time.  There was no indication of the fact that almost sixty years after it was made, it would still be hailed as the best movie of all time by the American Film Institute.

The question begging to be asked is, ""What makes this film so good?""  I honestly had a lot of trouble reconciling myself to the fact of its greatness.  Like so many objects of art in our time, once something is proclaimed great by a number of people, it has a certain sort of inertia that will not allow people to consciously question its greatness.  I know few people who have worked their way through such dense behemoths of books suck as Tolstoy's Anna Karina or Joyce's Ulysses.  Even with this fact, they remain classics of their languages, and held up as gold standards, which we should only hope to reach.  But I digress.  The problem with our generation is that we don't have the attention span to realize when we are seeing a master storyteller at work.  Many of the methods Welles pioneered have now become so overused that they have fallen in the realm of the clich&eacute;.  The cinematography we see was at the forefront of Film Noire, a genre whose popularity lasted well into its second decade, and whose only defeat was the rise of color in film.  Also seen is the non-linear story line, a device we can see influencing directors as diverse as Francis Ford Coppola and Quentin Tarintino.",1276473600,3,2314,4.611246943765281

The story premise is good, and Welles is a captivating actor, in my opinion, but on a scene by scene basis, the movie never really grabbed me.  There's a shallowness to it, a depth lacking from the characters...  although maybe that was the point?  Jorge Luis Borges wrote a very interesting review of this film in 1941, which when I look at it in that way re-interests me a bit, although ultimately it sounds like he comes to the same conclusion I do.  Here's the web address where you can read that review: [...]
But the movie is definitely worth watching, not only because it's sort of required watching for any film fan in the way that Moby Dick, however hard it is to get through the chapters on Cetology, is required reading (justly or not) for any American who considers themselves literate, but also because there is a truly epic, and highly intriguing story that is the film itself.  Welles and Hearst are great characters in themselves, fuller, more complicated and more absurd than any character in the film, and all of the hoopla surrounding the film and those characters as well as others (like Welles' ""co""-screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz)are definitely worth looking into.

798543,5,6304119046,"I wish I would have watched this movie earlier in my life.  It's so ridiculously hilarious.  I love Kane.  He reminds me of an over-the-top friend I had in college, except my friend had SOME stability.

But if Kane had stability, where would his ambition have gone?  It would have taken a back seat to his stability.  Sort of like my desire for stability keeps me hushed up about the dream I have of promoting G-rated Shock Value.

The message of this movie seems to be that personal ambition makes for an awesome story, but a horrible lifestyle.  No one watches this darn movie to see who or what Rosebud is.  People watch this movie to see the rise and fall of a man with an insane dream.  That's what makes the script of this movie so strong and gives it so many memorable quotes.  Kane clearly believes all the garbage he spews, even though he knows it's garbage.  Nowhere is this more clear than when he refuses to drop out of the race for governor.  For me, that's the defining moment of the film right there.

Best movie of all time?  Eh, that's debatable.  While it's certainly up there with movies like Mary Poppins and Annie Hall, it's tough to pick which is THE best.  It should be enough to say I like everything about this film.",1272672000,2,1241,4.37280701754386
798544,5,6304119046,"In 1941 actor/director/writer Orson Welles would release one of the most cherished films to ever hit the silver screen.  Many have cited it as the greatest film of all time, and many more agree that Citizen Kane is the quintessential American movie.  Like all great films it transcends traditional narrative to become something all its own.  The movie almost holds a surreal feel as audiences are thrust into the luxurious, yet lonely life of Charles Foster Kane.

Citizen Kane is a great looking film, no question about it.  It's obvious that the sets are fake but the movie uses that to its full advantage.  Each of these sets is so exaggerated and ornate that it allows the film to transcend generations.  It's a kind of timeless quality that is rarely seen in contemporary pieces.  What looked good in this film upon its release still looks good to this day because it is an exaggeration of the American culture, which when someone really thinks about it, hasn't changed much since the time of Citizen Kane's release.

Even more important to Citizen Kane's set designs are the lighting mixed with expert photography.  Lighting of Kane becomes the most crucial aspect of discerning his character and foreshadowing his path.  Though the dialogue is often brilliant, Citizen Kane seems to have been made with solely the visuals in mind, because it is clear that the story of Kane's rise and fall can be told through the powerful imagery presented throughout the movie.

From being the ""voice of the people"" through the use of his newspaper (The Inquirer) to giving off the ferocious political campaign speeches clearly inspired by Adolf Hitler, the scope of Citizen Kane never seems to back down in its uncompromising character-study of a man who could never back down.  As the viewer follows his path towards self-destruction they realize that this character is not unlike many who still inhabit the country to this very day.  When they look at Orson Welles as Kane they can see the type of person everyone knows all too well.  Everyone knows about someone who will do anything for love, only to discover he's done all the wrong things.  Kane fails in life because he never learns that an emotion such as love can never be bought.  Gratitude can be bought, or appreciation, but love requires something beyond the material realm of personal interaction.  All these emotional issues are brought to focus by the film's outstanding scope, which is far ahead of its time.

What else stands out about this film?  Everyone cites the lighting, directing, and sets, but also one needs to keep in mind: Orson Welles' acting is extraordinary.  He can be funny, tragic, compelling, charismatic, and many scenes he is in make-up in order to play Kane through the decades.  Surely it is one of the greatest performances ever captured on the silver screen.

So, is Citizen Kane the ""greatest movie ever made""?  Without much hesitation the answer is yes.  Maybe it isn't at times the most entertaining film ever made, but it clearly has the merits that make it worth seeing again and again.  This film looks great, its story is full of loose-ends for the audience to solve for themselves, but most important of all is how well the film has aged.  There are not many, if any complaints to be had in regards to Orson Welles cinematic landmark.

Citizen Kane remains the undisputed champion of American cinema...

But how is the DVD?  Well, in short: the two-disc special edition is a great restoration of this film and includes a great deal of special features.  The best of these features is a feature length commentary by infamous film critic Roger Ebert and the other being the documentary ""The Battle for Citizen Kane"" which is a great overview of the conflict between Orson Welles and communications tycoon William Hearst.

If you truly love movies you'd be a fool not to have this landmark film as a part of your collection.",1267660800,5,3914,4.812874251497006
798545,5,6304119046,"The greatest film ever made? That's debatable. It's debatable whether or not CITIZEN KANE is even Orson Welles' greatest film since TOUCH OF EVIL is regarded by many of the director's devotees as being better. Logically then, that would have to make TOUCH OF EVIL the greatest film ever made.

Actually, no single film has a right to such a designation as being the greatest. Every movie is limited by its genre and the specific story it proposes to tell. Different films have different things to say and many diverse ways of saying them. One genre - be it drama, horror, comedy, musical, etc. - is not above another. There are outstanding films of every type. Having said that, CITIZEN KANE is definitely one of the greatest films of its genre and of all time, and the influence it had on motion pictures is undeniable. However, many of the techniques accredited to it as being ""firsts"" have been used in movies well before KANE. Devices like flashbacks, overlapping dialogue, visible ceilings - these things weren't introduced in KANE as it's often cited. The difference was that Welles put them all together in one film to create a cinematic synthesis, like a magician's bag of tricks opened up to dazzle and enthrall the spectator. This comes as no surprise given the fact that Welles himself liked to dabble in magic and the art of illusion. One implausibility in the script was overlooked: When Kane whispers ""Rosebud"" on his deathbed no one is around to hear him, so how does everyone in the film know it was the last thing he said? The fact that we're willing to dismiss or not even notice this rather major oversight is a tribute to how the film's magic spell affects us.

Kept in proper perspective, CITIZEN KANE is still a powerful work, its vivid imagery lingers in our memory and its message - ""of what profit is it to a man if he gains the world but forfeits his soul?"" - remains as potent as ever. Warner's special edition does ample justice to Welles' most discussed film.

However, in my opinion, I wouldn't necessarily call it THE greatest movie of all time, as some critics would say. To me, The Godfather takes that place, but that's a completely different movie. Also, while it is an excellent film, Citizen Kane is not one of my personal favorites. Movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, No Country for Old Men, Das Boot, & The Insider are some of my favorites, but Citizen Kane is not. I've seen it straight-through at least twice, and it didn't leave a huge impression on me. Still, I can acknowledge Citizen Kane as one of the greatest movies of all time (but not THE greatest).

798549,5,6304119046,"Alright, ""greatest movie of all time"", let's see what you've got.

Anyone who sets out to review ""Citizen Kane"" with the goal of determining, on first viewing, whether it is the greatest film ever made is setting themselves up for disappointment.  It's a burden of expectations that is best set aside, insomuch as that is possible.  Reviewing ""Kane"" today poses a lot of challenges; its main plot point has been thoroughly spoiled, its technical innovations are standard by now, and it has been the subject of numerous parodies (the first I can remember seeing being an episode of ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" in the early 1990s).

We open with the famous dying word of one Charles Foster Kane, media tycoon turned disappointed recluse in his vast Florida mansion.  Kane, played as an adult by Orson Welles (actor/writer/producer/director; I'm assuming he just didn't have time to edit and score it), is plucked from his poor upbringing to a life of great wealth, and enters into the newspaper business.  On his death, a reporter out to uncover the meaning of `Rosebud' interviews various people from his past:  his second ex-wife Susan (Dorothy Comingore), his longtime #2, Bernstein (Everett Sloane), and his sometimes best friend Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten).  None has any idea what `Rosebud' means, but they talk a lot about their experiences with Kane.

""Citizen Kane"" is similar to the works of Theodore Dreiser, depicting the damage to the soul caused by the pursuit of money above all else.  Kane's whole life and all his relationships, public and private, are defined by trying to get people to love him, despite struggling to love anyone himself.  Kane is well-played by Welles, and supported by a group of great actors, notably ""The Third Man""'s Joseph Cotten.  The age makeup used to allow the same actors to play characters over a 50-year span is surprisingly good for the period (the black-and-white probably helps with that).  Many of ""Kane""'s technical innovations have been standardized in subsequent decades, but, having seen several other film styles from this era, one can still appreciate how this film looks.  I did find a few of the scene transitions and music a bit jarring.

Recommended (really, everyone should see this film just to get a sense of it).",1264723200,3,2271,4.986737400530504
798550,5,6304119046,"I got the two disc DVD set of Citizen Kane.  The film was quite controversial of the time and RKO Pictures originally was not going to play it because of the pressure put to bear by William Randolph Hearst, famous newspaper magnate and philanthropist.  Even to this day, the Hearst Corporation has its fingers in every pie:  radio, television, cable, satellite broadcasting, etc.  Hearst did not like that Orson was making what amounted to an unauthorized criticism on Hearst himself.

Similarities?  Oh yes!  Although the names were changed, the film follows Hearst's life to a Tee, with a lot of creative license being taken.

Orson Welles, only 24 years old, who, flushed from his success on the Mercury Theater and his famous (or infamous) broadcast, War of the Worlds, he created what many consider the best film of all time and many consider the beginning of the end of Orson's career as a radio, stage and film master of entertainment.

[For those who do not know, on Halloween night back in the 1930s, with America concerned about Hitler's advances in Europe, Welles adapted H.G. Wells War of the Worlds with realistic-sounding newscasts and had the Martians invading Grover's Mill, New Jersey.  Many people actually believed these broadcasts to be REAL and panicked!  Radio was like TV is today, with soaps, westerns, news, and so on as main entertainment and so having your shows interrupted by newscasts and bulletins was common.  This created major controversy and put Orson on the map!]

 But back to the review:

Charles Foster Kane, as a child,  is being taken away as the family can no longer have him.  His mother is played stoically by Agnes Moorhead, a strong character actress in her own right (well before ""Bewitched!"" the cheesy sitcom of the Sixties.).

Kane gets a newspaper, expands his empire, builds a castle (in Florida rather than San Simeon (current location of Hearst Castle), collects art as well as pretty girls, runs for office, confronts scandal and finally dies, dropping a snow globe and whispers ""Rosebud.""

Why Rosebud?  Well, the newspaper guys who are creating the news reel (News On The March!) want to know more about Kane and what Rosebud is.  The film then goes through a lot of flashbacks and personal interviews with fictional (and thinly disguised) friends of Kane to find out more about the man, his mission and what was Rosebud.

Was Kane a self-seeking vampire who sucked the spirit out of everyone he came in contact with?  Or did his childhood memories still haunt him decades after the fact?

Melodramatic to the extreme, some scenes were slow-paced.  The black & white photography was simply gorgeous.  And getting a peak at life as it might have been like in the early 20th Century was enjoyable and fascinating.

Disc Two:  Wow, this was great.  Actual filmed interviews with Orson Welles done in the 1980s before his death.  You can see his eyes light up as he recalled the creative energy he possessed as a very young man, creating plays in Harlem with an all Black cast in creating Shakespeare for the masses.

Touched on are the Mercury Theater broadcasts for CBS and the War of the Worlds broadcast.  The narrator said it best:  Orson accomplished it all at a young age and then was burned and never came back after Citizen Kane.

Extensive biographical data on Welles and Hearst, both driven men, both creative geniuses in their own ways, proud and gifted and heading on a collision course with each other.

""A film is never really good unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet.""

The film just looks different from other films with its dark geometric interiors and camera shots that actually accentuate all the interior settings. It also is a unique story for it famously follows the life of William Randolph Hearst and is a commentary on that oversized powerhouse ego-maniac. The two female leads in the film, Ruth Warrick, playing first wife Emily Monroe Norton Kane, and Dorothy Comingore, playing second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, were extremely strong performances that were as different from each other as night and day. For Kane is one of those people who do not think the normal consequences of life apply to him. When he runs for public office while attacking his political opponent, he never seems to realize that the fact that he has a mistress will come to light and destroy his marriage and his political career. Kane relentlessly attacks career politician James Gettys, played by Ray Collins. But Gettys is a seasoned street fighter. He gets the goods on Kane and then carefully confronts him in a set up situation where both women are involved. Emily Kane shows tremendous grace in the face of defeat and humiliation. But then a life of hell starts for Susan Alexander Kane for she becomes the project of her husband who pushes her to sing and become an opera star. Susan Kane's speaking voice can peel paint off walls, a penetrating and grating high volume whine. When she and Charles Kane escape to his castle, the film becomes surreal, something out of Camus or Sartre, where people become each other's hell. Susan Kane's fall into alcoholism is tragic and yet totally expected. Joseph Cotton plays Jebediah Leland, Kane's best friend who sinks into alcoholism and obscurity in the shadow of his overpowering friend. Agnes Moorehead plays Mary Kane, the poor puritanical mother who gives up her son so that he might develop the sophistication to enjoy his wealth.

Well, I have to conclude that it is probably impossible to single out any movie as the best, but if I had to it wouldn't be ""Citizen Kane.""

This is not to say that I thought it was a bad movie at all.  However, Welles's innovative use of the camera, which causes so many to regard it so highly, was so relentless that I was frequently pulled out of the story to consider the artifice of it, making it feel rather cold and technical.

798614,5,6304119046,"Yes.  Count me in as one of ""Them.""  A Kanenite.  Orson Welles's initial motion picture effort, CITIZEN KANE, not only is Welles's best film--it's the best film ever made.  Because of the story?  Well, that's certainly interesting enough in its own right, but it's not the reason this powerful film is the best ever captured on celluloid.  Look, any film that spawns books, documentaries, commentaries, and makes countless ""Best Films of All Time"" lists has got something unique and magical going for it.  So what is it?  To explore this topic, I highly recommend you get this TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION of CITIZEN KANE.

Made in 1941, when Welles was a mere twenty-five, CITIZEN KANE was light years ahead of its time in production, imagery, lighting, sets--unparalleled cinematography.  Easily one of the most creative and innovative of all films, CITIZEN KANE is a haunting presentation of moving camera shots (often through what are supposed to be inanimate objects), of rooms with low ceilings made of cloth (for lighting purposes, plus the cloth easily hid the boom mikes), of scene lighting contrasts where one character is in light, the other in total silhouette, of scenes shot entirely by a below-ground-level camera, of surreal close-ups, of a despondent Kane walking across the screen, his reflection captured in hundreds of mirrors.  All of the visual tricks and optical illusions serve to enhance and symbolize the story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon so extravagant and outrageous in his efforts to attract acceptance and love he ultimately garners neither--and loses everything, especially a connection to his childhood.  (""Rosebud."")  That Welles was making a thinly-disguised biography of mogul William Randolph Hearst was lost on no one, especially Hearst, who made so much trouble with RKO Studios the film was quickly shelved, and didn't find an appreciative audience until years later.

While this special edition contains several extras, you must view movie critic Roger Ebert's commentary.  Ebert, an unabashed and enthusiastic student and fan of CITIZEN KANE, is a wealth of information about all the scenes and their background history, about all the tricks and gimmicks and optical illusions Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland (the real star of this movie) dreamed up to make watching this film so mesmerizing.  For supporting actors, Welles brought over his Mercury Theater radio performers, who all made their screen debuts here, including Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore (playing a very shrill and petulant second wife), Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Everett Sloane, and William Alland (a longtime Welles assistant).  On disc two you'll find the documentary ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane,"" a 1996 PBS production; it explores the lives of Hearst, Welles, and the controversy surrounding the production of CITIZEN KANE in meticulous and fascinating detail.  The delicious irony here, in the film and in all of the extra features, is that not only is CITIZEN KANE the portrayal of William Randolph Hearst--it is also a thorough examination of the personality of Orson Welles himself.  Best movie ever?  A resounding yes.

After all, it is perennially ranked #1 (AFI, Sight & Sound, etc.) and thus there is an *expectation* that it will be one of the best.

It might well be other people's favorite film, but I cannot say the same. It was very good, and I will surely watch it again (I've already watched it twice on this nice new DVD). But I can think of several movies I like better, including Casablanca which came out a year later.

Funny enough, I see more of a parallel between Charles Foster Kane and Orson Welles (later in life) than I do between Kane and William Randolph Hearst. In the end I think the film is a technical masterpiece and kudos to Welles, who of course also directed and produced. But in my opinion, he was better in Touch of Evil (1958).

So all Citizen Kane has to stand on now is it's story, acting and script.  All of which are fine.  It's a movie that has aged somewhat well over the years.  The debate over the greatest movie ever made will rage on fforever (but you mostly see Citizen Kane and Casablanca somewhere on that list).  When Citizen Kane debuted, however, it was incredibly good craftsmanship for filming.  Remember, film was fairly young at this time.  There were still a lot of things that were being played around with and experimented with in film.  Citizen Kane, upon release, was hailed as a technical achievement that, for many reasons may seem like they aren't such a big deal today.  But they WERE a big deal then.

Almost everyone knows the story of Citizen Kane, but it doesn't hurt to recount it.  The story begins on Kane's death bed.  He utters one last word: ""Rosebud..."" before he dies.  Because of this, people are in question as to what Kane's last word meant.  What was the meaning behind ""Rosebud"" and who or what was it?  As people investigate, the audience is treated to Kane's life.  From being taken from his real parents to rising to being the best of the best in journalism.  And ultimately his downfall.  We see as Kane lives his life and becomes of the most iconic people in the world.  We meet several people and learn to really appreciate Kane as a character.  The movie keeps plowing forward until we the audience learn just what Rosebud really is.  It may not seem like much from the get go, but the screenplay in and of itself really plays out really well.  As we learn about Kane we're willing to be taken for a ride.  The last scene in particular--when we learn what Rosebud is--is a really fantastic scene in and of itself.

Yet there were certain things about Citizen Kane that made it unique for its time.  The first is that the movie is essentially a host of flashbacks telling the story of Charles Foster Kane.  It spans so much time, but it gets through it quickly.  Again, it seems like no big deal to us, but the way Orson Welles does it is still a technique very few do.  Even though time is passing in Kane's life, we hardly get that sense.  The time periods seem to mesh together because rather than tons of hardcuts we're mostly treated to it fading through his life, sometimes even in the same room.  Another technique that was done really well that was introduced by Citizen Kane was using makeup to make the characters age.  This, of course, is still done to this day.  The final technique that was quite astounding was the film's camera work.  Again, not a big deal in this day and age, but consider that Citizen Kane truly showed people you could do things with simple cuts and edits and pan shots.  For example, being able to see everything in the background foreground etc. in sharp, clear focus.  This was pretty amazing before.  If you take film classes, I'm sure you may get someone who goes on about this.  Citizen Kane's cinematography seems to be a favorite historical fact of many film buffs.

It may also seem strange that the cinematography is praised because for the first time in a shot you can see the ceiling of a home.  This is because many films didn't get filmed on location.  Seeing things like this was quite an amazing achievement when Citizen Kane came out.  To put it simply, there's historical significance to what Citizen Kane did for film.  Of course, you don't exactly think of that these days when you think of Citizen Kane.  Most of us, of course, remember ""Rosebud"" and others of us remember that first scene.  Many of us (myself included) weren't even around when Citizen Kane was the big influence it was.  Put simple, Citizen Kane was like Star Wars.  So innovative and different for its time that it sort of lives on as a result.

Of course, that also means that certain things about Citizen Kane are truly forgotten.  Unless you actually study film or read up on it, those who watch Citizen Kane now might be scratching their heads wondering just what the big deal is.  Indeed Citizen Kane does have things about it which might not bode well in this day and age.  The first being that Citizen Kane just feels long.  It's a two hour long movie, but I won't lie... it's boring.  It's an amazing film that everyone should see at least once, but it can be boring.  And it has little to do with special effects (which I'm not a big fan of anyway) or anything like that.  It's because the movie just moves at a snails pace.  It takes a lot of time to really develop Mr. Kane, but a lot of it can be very boring to watch.  Yet at the same time there are many exchanges that are quite interesting to watch.  The narrative in and of itself is very good.  It's just that... like I said, it's boring.  There are times when watching that you sort of feel like asking ""Are we there yet?""  It's mostly in the middle when the film begins to drag, but as we move on, especially that last scene, the brilliance of the film's screenplay can be seen.

With it's reputation of being among the greatest films ever made, it may surprise people to know that Citizen Kane didn't take home that Oscar for Best Picture.  In fact, of all the awards it was nominated for at the Academy Awards... it only won one.  For screenplay.  Despite all it's innovations in cinematography, art direction, and editing, Citizen Kane was never honored with an Oscar for any of these categories.  And when reading up on Citizen Kane you sort of get the feeling that perhaps the film was cheated out of those awards.

In spite of it all, Citizen Kane is a movie worth viewing at least once if you're a big movie lover.  It's one of those movies that ought to be viewed not just for enjoyment, but perhaps for historical purposes as well.  It is nice to say that the story and narration have aged incredibly well and are still fondly influential.  It's just a shame that the innovations of Citizen Kane aren't realized in quite the same manner.",1249516800,6,6384,4.446937014667817

  Very simply, the film begins with the infamous scene every movie buff has seen. An older man with his last breath says, ""Rosebud"" and drops a snowglobe. It shatters on the floor.  He has died in his enormous mansion.
  And now the story begins.

 For those impatient movie watchers: It is important to see the ""mock"" documentary during the beginning of this film to get the idea how Kane (Orson Welles) became so rich. After a newsreel has been reviewed, they try to investigate why Kane said, ""Rosebud"" on his deathbed.
  Just who is ""Rosebud"".  Does this ""Rosebud"" inherit a fortune?
  They begin to interview every important person in his life since he became rich to locate ""Rosebud"".  Along the way we discover his miserable childhood.  As an adult with the help of his guardian, Mr Thatcher, he decides it would be fun to run a newspaper.
  i will not spoil the rest of the story for you, but you will discover how Charles Foster Kane became the world's richest tychoon.  However, in his personal life, his life wasn't always a bed of roses.

  Also in the cast: Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Joseph Cotten, Sonny Bupp, Buddy Swan, Joseph Cotten, Alan Ladd, Dorothy Comingore, Renee Godfrey, Paul Stewart.

This movie was chosen to be preserved and was added to the National Film Registry in 1989 by the United States national Film Preservation Board.

  Trvia: Many thought this film was based upon the real-life weathy newspaper publisher, William Randolph Hearst, to which Orson Welles denied to aviod lawsuits.

  Orson Welles was only 25 years old at the time of filming. During the scenes of Kane destroying Susan's room, Orson Welles' hand was really bleeding as his threw himself into motivation. He continued his scenes like a pro.

  Orson Welles wanted Lucille Ball for the lead, but RKO vetoed it.  Lucy repaid his kindness by having Orson appear on her hit CBS tv series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Lucy-The-Complete-Sixth-Season/dp/B000E6EJWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Lucy - The Complete Sixth Season</a>&nbsp;in 1956.
  In 1958, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz would buy RKO and changed the title to Desilu.
  Orson Welles and Lucille Ball would meet again on Dean Martin's Celebrity Roast: Jimmy Stewart, televised in 1978.

  You may have first heard of Orson Welles from his CBS Radio program, ""The Mercury Theater on the Air"" dramatization,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-of-the-Worlds-Original-Broadcast/dp/B000LZ5AIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War of the Worlds - Original Broadcast</a>, October 30, 1938.

  People who listened to the above broadcast thought it was real and it caused a mass panic. People were calling the operators, the police, and emergency because they were upset. People called into CBS Radio not realizing it was only a radio dramatization, not an actual news report. People were sensitive because of the war.
 This is dramatized in the tv-movie, The Night That Panicked America (1975).

798660,3,6304119046,"There is a lot to like in Citizen Kane if you are a film student or historian.  The plot isn't bad either and Orson Wells broke a few molds getting this film out.  If you study film history, this is the one for you.  If you are looking for some entrancing entertainment, there are better choices.  I've seen the film 5 times and each time I ask myself, so, where's all this best film of all time stuff located.  In the beginning?  Middle?  Ending?  Rosebud?

Like all art, film can exist on many levels.  Kane is perfect for the classroom but not necessarily your living room.  It is a better movie than the Oscar winner for that year, 'How Green was my Valley', but not better than 'The Little Foxes', 'The Maltese Falcon', 'Sullivan's Travels' or 'Sergeant York' all released in the same year.

I might have given Kane 4 or 5 stars but I'm revolting from the politically correct ratings and giving you my honest opinion.  All 5 of the other films mentioned in this review will give you more viewing pleasure.  I've been collecting and studying film for over 35 years so this review is not from a Star Wars generation type person.",1245628800,3,1131,4.453658536585366
798661,5,6304119046,"For all the baggage that Citizen Kane is bagged with, it's pretty remarkable that underneath, the hype (Citizen Kane tops the list of AFI's greatest films of all time, on both editions), the hate, and opposing view points about it, Citizen Kane is really a good movie.  Make no mistake, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not the best movie of all time, but that's not it's fault some people scrutnize it because of those biased film geeks at the American Film Institure (though it certainly has more of it's virtues than a magazine like Rolling Stone does) It is one of the most innovative films, however, and I won't deny the importance of the movie.  The good thing about all this is that the movie is still a great movie, and has a good story, and the filmmaking and artistic quality is still very good.  Here's why I think so.

Personally, I don't think the film making in this movie is a product of it's time. While it's not as fresh as it must have been when it was first released, it's still has artistic quality and has some of the coolest shots still worth looking at years later.  The Rosebud shot, the opener, the noirish look, the scene with the mirrors, even the art direction in this movie is great.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland deserved an Oscar for his work (of course he didn't), as it's as incredible to hear about the details from the commentary from Roger Ebert (this man is a film critic, he knows a ton about film that idiots like Ben Lyons and Gene Shalit only wish they did).  The acting is great, and it's hard to believe that Welles was able to pull off both young and old Kane (the make up was responsible for the old, and that was even influential), convincing no less.  It always feels like a meticolously crafted film, and it pretty much is.  The only potential thing that could be considered dated in some eyes is the black and white and 1941 production standards, which to me don't even matter much.  Everything else looks as fresh as it did in 1941.

Citizen Kane is basically a pastiche of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper king who apparently did not like this movie because it portrayed him in a negative light.  Regarding it's meaning, the message may be obvious for a lot of people.  And no, it doesn't rely on the symbolism.  I sort of agree with Ray Carney on the symbolism part, which is nice, but not really a profound statement.  Symbolism to me is more like a cool footnote, and if it's done tastefully, it works merely well. (that can't be said for the millions of mediocre student films that say nothing, except they are slathered with pretentious symbolism).  Citizen Kane is both of the previously mentioned.  However, I do not find the scene where he finds the globe to be symbolism.  I've seen objects before that totally transfix me and take me back to my younger days, I don't know, but it does.  The object isn't the focus, the way he reacts to the object is the focus.

Rather, I think Citizen Kane is loss of pureness, or idealism.  Kane wanted to help other people because he's truly believed it in the beginning, but gradually became selfish, empty.  Kane is just a representation of just how many things can be reduced from their good intentions to emptiness.  Look at the concepts of free will, individualism, love, and personal fullfillment.  All of these things are pure when taken in the right mind, but all of these have been robbed and dumbed down into general fakeness (the government, marketing, music, movies, even people themselves) and used to push buttons, sell products, and trick people into believing the fakeness is actually genuine.  At a most basic level though, it shows that money indeed doesn't buy happiness, and you have to be internally motivated, and for good reasons.  There's nothing more enriching than good relationships (with the right people) and genuine care,  and if we give in to greed and fakeness, we could end up just like Kane.  That's my take on the meaning of Citizen Kane.

Is Citizen Kane, in my opinion, the best film of all time?  It's definitely the most influential, and maybe it deserves the greatest title as a monument kind of stature, but it will never be among my favorite films of all time.  And that' mostly the difference here. It will never be a personal favorite to me, but Citizen Kane, for the right camp (I am in that camp), will satisfy mightily.  Please ignore everyone else and whatever anybody tells you and like it for how you like it.  There is no other way in life in figuring out what you like.",1242172800,4,4520,4.561338289962825
798662,5,6304119046,"In 1941, after Orson Welles had already made a splash in theater and radio, he headed for Hollywood. The 26-year old whiz kid decided to take on another big name, newspaperman William Randolf Hearst. His first film, Citizen Kane, would be a satire on Hearst's life. Not only would Welles star in the film, but he would also direct and co-write it. Although the film was almost destroyed forever, it can still rightly be called the one of the greatest movies ever made!

The film opens by the deathbed of newspaper mogul Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) just in time to hear his dying word: ""Rosebud"". What is Rosebud? That's the question reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) wants answered by any means necessary. Thompson sets out to investigate first-hand accounts of Kane and interview the people who knew him best. Told through flashbacks, Kane's life unfolds from his childhood, his rise to wealth and power in the mass media, his scandalous political career, two disastrous marriages, and his eventual fall. From these events, Thompson tries to piece together Kane's life and solve the mystery of what Rosebud truly is...

With the making of this film, Hearst was outraged. Hearst and Welles were on a collision course and their two enormous egos clashed. Hearst banned any mention of the film in his media empire and vowed to have the film destroyed and Welles' future career ruined. Fortunately, the latter two did not happen exactly as planned (although neither of them were quite the same afterward), and Citizen Kane survived to be the great film we all know today.

The film is innovative in its use of light and shadow, its non-linear style of storytelling, and Welles' incredible make-up job. He looks totally believable as Charles Foster Kane in all the stages of his adult life. All the shots were meticulously planned and nothing at all was wasted.

The two-disc set of Citizen Kane not only contains the classic film, but also two full-length audio commentaries, storyboards and newsreels, and a two hour documentary called ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" produced by the PBS series, The American Experience. What more could you ask for?

This film, for some inexplicable reason, has been built up over the years by the pretentious set as an icon of cinematic excellence. These are the same type of people who probably think Pablo Picasso was a great artist. Not because they have the intellect or taste to judge him a great artist, but because other misguided people have influenced their weak minds. It is time for the truly reasonable among us to finally stand up and proclaim that,""The Emperor is not wearing any clothes!"" In other words, Citizen Kane is an extremely boring, dated and grossly overrated film that was a commercial failure in its day.(It lost its studio,RKO, $150,000) Which just goes to show, people had much better taste back then.",1237075200,7,999,4.58659217877095

Citizen Kane is an anomaly in the history of film.  Orson Welles came to Hollywood, a fervent, raging 24 year old theater and radio prodigy with no film background whatever.  He created in one film a tragedy meant to be larger in scope and power than any Shakespeare play, a film that would draw on the human need to piece together someone from stories and recollections (a non linear narrative- no film had ever been made in this way before), a film that would use every cinematic device available to tell it's story.  No studio ever gave a new director (or any director) this much power, and never had any new director seized on a such a complete vision for how to make a film in such a new way.  The script by Herman Mankiewicz used the life of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst as it's main body, and this ignited a terrible battle of wills between Welles and Hearst. The included documentary 'the battle over Citizen Kane' is crucial in understanding these 2 men. Because the ultimate irony here is that the message of the lone businessman who runs off everyone in his search for love is really not Hearst's story at all, but Welles'. Welles lost all his clout, sank into obscurity, became an industry joke, and died. He became the bitter recluse, his onscreen creation. That's the real tragedy, here.",1236038400,2,1344,4.630252100840337

If the AFI never put out a top 100 list, this film would have fallen into obscurity long ago, and it would have stayed where it belongs, a novelty for film school students...

First let me start by saying that although I appreciate Star Wars, I was not brought up on MTV.

I am a tremendous fan of movies in general, and a huge fan of black-and-white films..the greatest ever....Casablanca....also very good, almost anything by Frank Capra...and for those into action, go rent (or better buy) a copy of Gunga Din........

But Citizen Kane is simply....unwatchable....

It is sooooooo boring......

I give Orsen Wells a lot a credit for making a movie at 24, but if he was 44 and this was his 20th film would everyone still be so enamored with it??

If film people like it because it has ""out of the ordinary"" camera angles, and uses film tricks like ""flashbacks"", fine, but that does not make this a good movie...

By the way, one thing has always bothered me about the movie that nobody ever brings up. Everyone says that Wells was so ""brave"" in making a film belittling William Randolf Hearst (one of the most powerful men of his time). My question is, how shallow was Orsen Wells that he had to try to make a name for himself by attacking someone else. Now maybe Hearst was a creap, and deserved to be attacked, but if you made the same movie and had the lead character be an oil tycoon, or a bank president, Wells (and his movie) would not have had the buzz it did back in 1941 or even today for that matter. I wonder then if history would still speak so highly of this film..............

So in conclusion.....any film that helped make Steven Speilberg or Martin Scorsese want to be a film Director, yea........but that dosen't make it a good film....

My advice (sorry amazon), rent it, or watch it on late night television, and then decide if it is something that you want in your home film library.............it will never be in mine......................",1231459200,8,2117,4.594164456233422
798728,4,6304119046,"This review is for the Turner Home Ent version of Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition).  The reason I emphasize that fact, is the reason I recommend it.  As everyone knows, Citizen Kane appears every year near the top of the list of the greatest films ever made.  In my opinion, if that were objectively true, then you could show it to anyone and they would agree, but they don't.  I have shown the film to many friends over the years and most seem puzzled by its status as the greatest.  Why?
  In art, there are works that stand alone.  There is no question why they were created.  Alongside these are works that are incomplete although the art dealers and art critics would never admit it.  These works have a hidden secret interpretation.  The best example is minimalism.  To the uninitiated, a solid-colored canvas seems like someone forgot to paint a picture into it, but once the concept of color fields as art is revealed, you may realize that the works connect to that idea.  So then and now, the art question hinges on whether or not an art work that needs THE BIG EXPLANATION in order to connect to the audience is a great or even good work of art.
  On the second disk is a fascinating documentary film called, `The Battle Over Citizen Kane.'  It is THE BIG EXPLANATION and I have found that not only do people tend to agree that Citizen Kane deserves is status as The Greatest after they view it, but often they want to see Citizen Kane again to see what they missed.  Since the documentary is somewhat required viewing for ""the greatest movie ever made,"" I have a hard time giving Citizen Kane my vote for the greatest, but I recommend anyone to watch the documentary first unless they were there in 1941.",1230940800,2,1722,4.503225806451613

798732,5,6304119046,"First, let me get one thing out of the way: Citizen Kane is not the greatest movie ever made. It is the safest choice for the best movie ever made based on who you're trying to kiss up to. The way the critics gush about this movie, you'd think Citizen Kane invented cinematography, nuance, good storytelling, etc. Whoever says that this movie is the greatest movie of all time has only seen fifteen movies. Check out Children Of Paradise, Scenes From a Marriage, Au hassard Balthasar, The Red Shoes, Rashoman, La Dolce Vita, The 400 Blows, The Battle of Algiers, Metropolis, Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Making of Citizen Kane, etc, etc, etc. There are thousands of films that can make a strong case for being the greatest film ever made, so I'll just focus on the merits of Citizen Kane.

First, Citizen Kane is loosely based on the life of Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst and his rise to the top of the newspaper business. The story is told in a series of flashbacks that are each narrated by an old acquaintance whose account cannot--for various reasons including inebriation and dementia--be completely trusted. However, all of their accounts of Kane's life share a common thread: Kane was incomplete. Everything he bought was a substitute for Rosebud and his stolen childhood, which became fuel for his obsession for power and the love of the public through his newspapers.

Orson Wells played both Kane and himself--a powerful and talented prodigy who had no sense of his own limitations. And, indeed, at the tender of of only twenty-four years of age, Welles had absolutely every reason to fall on his face. He didn't, he couldn't--not after securing the most lucrative motion picture contract in the history of motion pictures (for his time). William Hearst tried to destroy the film, to keep the world from seeing Citizen Kane; however, the film survived both Welles and Hearst, and lives on for the ages as a proverb: no matter how far you travel, you can never escape who you truly are. The technical achievements of this film are legendary. Believe it or not, the second disc, the Battle Over Citizen Kane, is actually better than the film itself. A film that is well worth the hype, though not the title of greatest film ever. See it, but judge it in the overall context of great films and think for yourself.

798733,4,6304119046,"It is a spooky night. Atmospheric dramatic music accompanies the camera to a heavily fenced perimeter. The heavy cast iron entry gate shows an ominous logo, a circle with a big K inside it, right next to it a sign saying ""No Trespassing"" and right then we know we will enter a domain, which is forbidden to anyone but the viewer. In the far distance in the darkness we notice a single lonely light coming from a gigantic mansion, but we still have quite a way to go and so we continue our ghostly journey across this mysterious and haunting estate while we keep an eye on the light, passing a lifeless pond, sculptures, a zoo and all in a more or less state of decay. Suddenly the light coming from the house is extinguished. The music holds its breath, what's going on here? We sense it's more than merely a person going off to bed; the music and preceding images have prepared us for something different.
There's a slow transition and suddenly we are in a room where it's ... snowing? in soft white idyllic looking scenery, midst of which we notice a rather ramshackle house. The camera pulls back and we now realize we were looking inside one of these glass toys, held by a hand that, while its owner expels his last breath, must release its grip and it falls to the ground where it shatters, after which the camera zooms in to the lips of the dying man which can still utter one last word ""Rosebud"" before closing forever.

This is the magic beginning of a brilliant movie called ""Citizen Kane"" , probably the most famous directorial debut in cinematic history from Orson Welles, who the world mostly knew before that as the voice behind the notorious ""War of the Worlds"" radio show that panicked half the country as it was taken for a news broadcast, who subsequently became famous with his ""Mercury Theatre Company"" both of which resulted in him getting an up to then unprecedented carte blanche for his debut feature which included sole final cut control.
The owner of aforementioned lips is called Charles Foster Kane, media mogul with even presidential ambitions once upon a time that were thwarted during a senator election because of a cover-up. The movie's premise is simple: a journalist's attempt to track down the meaning of the mysterious last word coming from Kane's mouth ""Rosebud"".

We tag along his research which involves a series of interviews of key people in Kane's life that offer us through the flashbacks they trigger a gradual insight into his life: His childhood in poor circumstances, an inheritance on condition of leaving behind said childhood in general and his mother in particular and eventual retreat literally and metaphorically behind walls to shield himself from the outside world by whom he feels unloved and misunderstood. Most of all Kane is a tragically lonely man with emptiness in his heart, created there by the forced severing of the connection with his mother as a child, which he keeps on trying to desperately fill by either earning or trying to buy people's love.

As he is unable to really invest something of himself in any relationship, all his human contacts remain hollow and long term are doomed to fail, which no huge and megalomaniac ""Xanadu"" can remedy, the estate he bought and ""pimped"" one would say nowadays I suppose, with art and animals from all over the world, to rule his own little empire that the world wouldn't permit him outside its bounds.

Orson Welles with this movie created a first rate masterpiece, helped by the fantastic script by mainly Joseph Manckiewicz (with input by John Houseman and Welles himself), a great director himself, and cinematographer Gregg Toland who came up with all kinds of technical novelties like the famous ""deep focus"" shots. Quite experimental as well was the use of sound and light, but those are just interesting little facts. Sure, they contribute to the movie's impact, but it is the story and the cast's performances that give it life.

Our tenacious reporter will never find the answer to the question of the meaning of the word ""Rosebud"", but the director mercifully informs the audience. That being said a lot of guesswork remains for the viewer and to some extend it will remain a mystery as to who this Charles Foster Kane really was.

I will not go into the parallels between the fictional character of Kane and newspaper owner William Randolph Hearst, the included documentary ""The Battle over Citizen Kane"" will serve to give all the information one could wish for on that matter and it's quite fascinating, but in the end to me inconsequential to the appreciation of this movie.

This film deals with these things in a visceral experience of entertainment.  This film had to be quite a risk for 1941 but it's clear that it could not have been any better if made in 2001.  I thoroughly enjoyed every last second of it.

798790,5,6304119046,"I thought ""Citizen Kane"" was well acted and well written and produced.  It is a glimpse into the life of ""a big American"", as Thompson's boss Rawlston pointed out, but ultimately it is a story of how consumed we can become by our own demons if we allow them to overtake us.  Kane could be seen as a hypocrite--championing the workingman and fighting for his interests, while at the same time employing the tactics of those he rails against (the rich, privileged, and powerful).  But at heart, he is just a man looking for love and acceptance (from friends, family--particularly his mother, who sent him away at 10 years of age--and the people).  And because it never works out for him, he takes his losses in the most personal way, until finally he is consumed by it and it takes its toll on him (symbolized by the Rosebud sled being consumed once and for all by the flames of the furnace).  Rosebud was, indeed, something he lost--his link to his childhood and it would forever have an impact on him.

798837,5,6304119046,"Oh how the times have changed.

A film that was in all actuality a box-office flop; critically panned and literally booed at the 14th annual Oscars; a film that received nine Oscar nominations yet only received one statuette (for screenplay) rises from the ashes of a pummeling demise to become considered the greatest American film of all time.  All too often this is the case; a film is either critically lauded or distained only to, with time, change the minds of the American public.  `Citizen Kane' rests comfortable at the top (the number one position) of AFI's list of the top 100 films ever made, and I don't see it dropping positions anytime soon (unless `The Godfather' sneaks in).  Personally, I feel that America got this right; the second time.

While I personally prefer Coppola's `gangster' masterpiece I feel that `Citizen Kane' is a marvelous example of perfected cinema, an entertaining and enlightening film that stands the test of time and in all actuality gets better as the years roll by.

The film opens the fragile whisper of the word ""Rosebud"" before it explodes with the exclamation of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane's death.  The film revolves around a news reporter trying to uncover the meaning behind Kane's last word, ""Rosebud"".  What that reporter finds though is that no man's life can be summed up with one word.

I find that revelation to be supremely important and universally reaching.  The whole of `Citizen Kane' can be summed up in the realization that no man can be fully understood without fully understanding where he came from, what he strived for and ultimately what he became.  As this reporter interviews those closest to Kane, those who loved and or hated him, he (as well as we) gets a beautifully well rounded and complete picture of the man that was Charles Foster Kane.  We get an inside look at his professional life as well as his personal life; his friends, his wives, his business partners.  We get to see how Kane interacted with others, how he dealt with those close to him and even those who peered down at him with evil intent; but as the film draws to its close we realize that the one thing we never got to see is the one missing link to fully grasping `who' Charles Foster Kane really was.

That is his `rosebud'.

Sure, `Citizen Kane', in the process of exposing this man, delves into the politics of corruption and greed, wealth and power, but it's the underlying message that floats to the surface and becomes the true root of the film.  When one walks away from this film he is left with a reflective work of deep meaning and everlasting presence; a universal message that touches the foundations of humanity and dwells eternally in the bowels of those privileged to witness this masterpiece.

The first thing I noticed about `Citizen Kane' was its visual styling.  This is a film that feels up-to-date all the way around.  I'm fully convinced that this film could be released this year and it would hold up strongly against the world of modern cinema.  You know how some films feel dated?  `Citizen Kane' is not that film.

Another facet of `Citizen Kane' that is stellar beyond compare is that of the acting, especially on the part of the films writer, director and star Orson Welles.  Welles is charismatic, natural and convincing.  He gives a masterfully well rounded and committed performance that stands tall as one of the finest male performances of all time.  Seriously, how he lost the acting Oscar is beyond me.  How this movie lost any of the Oscars it was snubbed for; Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture, Score, Film Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction and Sound Recording; is beyond me.  At least it was honored with the Screenplay Oscar, but still, that's such a token award for such a marvelous film.

`Citizen Kane' is lauded as one of the greatest, as the greatest even, and I have to jump on that bandwagon and let my voice be heard.  This is a revelation, an iconic piece of cinema that is sure to prove supremely entertaining and rewarding to the viewer.  The film is paced beautifully, never loses the audience's attention or appreciation and, as I mentioned, just gets better and better every time you watch it.  Orson Welles had a vision, a marvelous vision at that, and while it was not fully understood or appreciated upon its release, he can `rest in peace' now, fully aware that his vision will never be forgotten.",1209081600,4,4422,4.741176470588235

Considered by many as the greatest movie ever made it did not disappoint. The acting was terrific. The camera angles and shots were for the time in a league of their own. Making a movie based on the lastword of a dying man (rosebud) and keeping you the movie goer watching until the end just to find out what he meant was also amazing.
To bad we do not see Hollywood put more of these types of movies out.

798839,5,6304119046,"Lots of people would use lots of different criteria for themselves in deciding what makes a movie great; I know people who dismiss any movie that's in black and white for instance.  Others need non-stop action with fancy special effects and crystal clear colour enhanced with CGI if necessary before they would even consider the content as a candidate for greatness.  For me, a movie has to have substance and it has to move me with an abiding message that never gets old even with repeated viewing.

Like another reviewer, I agree that what makes this movie for me other than the innovative manner of telling a story using flashbacks and excellent acting and directing is the message that the movie is trying to put across and ""Citizen Kane"" does this extremely well indeed.  For me this movie proves that our actions and what we eventually become are inextricably linked to how we treat one another and how we in turn are treated.  We see young Kane as a relatively well-balanced kid who is suddenly traumatised with a shocking dislocation from his familiar and loving family background to embark upon a life not of his own choosing.  Charles Foster Kane becomes what he becomes as a consequence of this probably feeling that a lack of parental love and a lack of control over his life is what led to his involuntary departure from his ""Eden"" subsequently over compensates and results in his self-destructive and generally despised future behaviour.  I found myself greatly sympathising with Welles' character and it helped me understand my own life too.  This movie touched me deeply and the great acting, directing etc was a nice plus too.

This 2-disc version is a real treat for fans as well as the picture quality is brilliantly restored; the only thing I would have liked to have is an option for Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 or DTS with THX quality sound.  They were able to do it with ""Gone With the Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" etc and so they really should be able to go all out for this of all films.  The documentary ""The Battle for Citizen Kane"" is also very good and is a big plus for the overall package.

If he had known it was of a snow scene he might have had the wits to trace it back to young Kane's winter of discontent when the bank seized hold of him and stole him from his beloved sleigh.  How dumb could one get?  (Perhaps as dumb as many investigative reporters are who fail to deliver the goods or come up with erroneous nonsense that they pass off as truth - or WMDs?) Anyway - I will forever wonder if Thompson's not picking up the ""ball""(in this case albeit a glass, smashed one) was intentional by the makers of KANE or was Thompson just tired at the end of the day or was this a script glitch?  Also not mentioned - to my knowledge - is the preponderance of fireplaces in the film...leading up to the end one which consumes the secret for all time.  (Notice the fireplace directly behind the young Kane when he is given a new sleigh by Thatcher - portent of things to come.)  One other thing that I have never seen mentioned in commentaries of the film is this:  the great Kane-as-a-boy snow scene....the snowman....it is a forecast of the endless statues that the elder Kane will collect; plus...it somewhat looks like the bald-domed, fatter Kane when we last see him: in the Colorado scene we thereby have child and future man, together.  The fact that a snowman is frozen- as Kane is emotionally frozen (especially at the end of the film after Susan leaves) is another point to be considered. So when we first see the dying Kane he God-like holds his past world in his hand, yet being a limited human being afterall (despite Kane's seeming unlimitness of power and money, etc) he cannot enter the scene in the ball...just like he cannot return to that moment in Time.  Conversely, when we first see Kane as a boy, he is in the world of the glass ball - but that world is also about to be shattered by the adults who plot his future within the confines of the warm boarding house. It is then - from this interior - that we see child Kane framed...as he is also about to  be ""framed"" for a crime he did not commit and sentenced to a life of wealth and riches he never asked for - or may have ever even wanted.  In both cases, however, the dying Kane at the film's opening and the first time we see K as a child - in both instances, he is....alone.  Existentially alone in a frozen world that only the human heart and hearthside can warm. One last thing to anyone familiar with the music of Rachmaninoff:  listen to his magnificent tone poem ""Isle of the Dead"" and you will hear what is essentially the Kane motif throughout it.  I absolutely love the music of Bernard Herrmann but cannot help thinking he was influenced - however subconsciously - by Rachmaninoff's piece.  Even the painting that Rachmaninoff based his tone poem on is reminiscent of Xanadu, somewhat.  Anyway - CITIZEN KANE is the ultimate film about ALL of us....not just powerful, multimillionaire publishers....but ALL of us...because we ALL have a ""Rosebud"" in our souls and minds that will be on our lips when the curtain closes.  ""Rosebud"" is, in its most basic form, the desire we all share to....start again, conquer Time, turn back the clock and NOT have die and end our dreams or our bodies.  This is what ultimately makes KANE....a CITIZEN.",1202601600,,4252,4.540575916230367
798842,5,6304119046,"At the opening of Orson Welles' 1941 film CITIZEN KANE, a dying old man drops a snowglobe as he whispers his last word ""Rosebud"". Some two hours later we learn that this puzzling utterance was the name of his beloved childhood sleigh. If this mystery was all there was to the film, I would be angry at the number of cartoons that have spoiled it. Luckily, however, ""Rosebud"" merely sets up the skeleton of the film. When a reporter goes to interview those who knew the deceased, the real drama of the story turns out to be the rise and fall of newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles himself).

Based on William Randolph Hearst, Kane is an inheritor to a great fortune, yet he chooses to work at a minor newspaper, turning it into the leading daily of New York City through abhorrent yellow press methods. Being able to create the news itself in determining what goes on the front page only feeds the fires of his megalomania. Driven to believe in his own greatness--while he simultaneously craves the love of those around him to validate himself--Kane goes from a popular man of the people to an eccentric recluse with two failed marriages and no friends left. As he sits in his vast estate, surrounded by an art collection he never even unwrapped, Welles convincingly relays the moral that possessions don't buy happiness.

I initially found the film difficult to appreciate in some aspects of production. The transitions between scenes are primitive, and the make-up used when Welles and a couple of others play old men is not convincing. However, the quality of the screenplay is more than sufficient to make up for the limitations of early 1940's film-making. The acting is superb as well. Though I find Welles more gripping as the younger and sociable Kane than the old recluse, many of the other actors play their roles with perfect naturalness. Surprisingly, many of these actors had never appeared on film before, which makes their achievement all the more impressive.

Evidentally no pristine transfer of the film exists. That's a real shame, but nonetheless the film is enjoyable even in its shoddy video quality. Writing reviews like this is somewhat unnecessary--CITIZEN KANE is such a legendary film that if you enjoy cinema you'll seek it out regardless of what I say.",1202169600,5,2305,4.830379746835443

I could hardly imagine how difficult it would be to make the greatest movie ever and do it as your first movie before your 26th birthday. When you look at movies, there is before ""Citizen Kane"" and after. There were so many innovations in that movie that have become standard now, some people fail to realize how great this movie is.

798844,4,6304119046,"It is very difficult to write a review for a film like ""Citizen Kane"", that is universally accepted as being one of the greatest movies of all time. It seems unnecessary to write another review proclaiming its brilliance, while to say anything else seems like sacrilige. The only way I think that this can be done is by considering each aspect of the film one at a time.

""Citizen Kane"" is the story of multi-millionaire Charles Foster Kane, told by those who knew him, to a journalist, after his death. It is said to be based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who attempted, unsuccessfully, to have the film suppressed upon its release.

Technically, ""Citizen Kane"" is a brilliant film. From a historical point of view, this film revolutionized film making. In ""Citizen Kane"", Orson Welles introduced a number of cinematic techniques that had previously never been used in American movies. Prior to ""Citizen Kane"", movies were just seen as little more than filmed stage plays. Orson Welles changed that and because of him film became an artistic medium in its own right. Although, Welles's use of these techniques seems a little clumsy by modern standards, considering that he didn't have decades of movies to refer to, what he did was incredible.

The acting in ""Citizen Kane"" is uneven in quality. Orson Welles (who received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this film) is excellent as Kane, as is Joseph Cotten as Kane's best friend. The film is let down, however, by its supporting actors, in particular Dorothy Comingore as Kane's second wife. Nevertheless, it is pointed out at the end of the film that the majority of the actors in this film had never appeared in movies before, so to a certain extent, the poor acting can be overlooked. (As an aside, watch out for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance by Alan Ladd as a journalist in the final scene of the film).

What lets down ""Citizen Kane"" the most is its script. From the vantage point of the 21st century, ""Citizen Kane""'s Oscar winning script seems slow-moving and is the victim of poor character development. The news reel scene at the start of the film goes on for too long, as does the second half of the film, about Kane's personal life. I would have preferred to see more of his newspaper career. Further, the characters of both of Kane's wives are underdeveloped.

Overall, I do not think ""Citizen Kane"" deserves to be called the ""best"" film of all time. There are other better films out there, even films made at about the same time, for example ""Casablanca"", which was made the following year. Nevertheless, I will agree that it is one of the most influential movies of all time, and for that it deserves to be seen.",1199577600,2,2698,4.744136460554371
798845,5,6304119046,"This is a good DVD version of a great movie.  I understand that it fails to engage many viewers, and I don't want to sound condescending and suggest that the unengaged lack attention spans.  Certain art pleases some and displeases others and this film is no different.

""Kane"" combines humor and pathos in a tale of lost innocence, arrogance and self-destruction (plus numerous other themes) that will either speak to you or annoy you by the end.  It spoke to me.  I loved the symobolism and allegory, and I, personally, love the history that goes along with the film of the epic battle between Welles and Hearst.

In terms of the history of American Cinema, you cannot dismiss this film.

If so, there's nothing that can be done about it using today's technology. Despite this problem, it is quite viewable. The audio is in much better shape, however, and the recovery there seems to have gone quite smoothly.

The American Experience doc is first-rate. It not only tells the story of the effort to suppress Kane, but how the two egoistic giants--Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst--almost destroyed themselves in the battle over the picture. The backstage stories of Welles' excessive lifestyle, treatment of his Mercury players, and personal background that made Citizen Kane ultimately more the story of Welles life than of Hearst's are first-rate.

798910,5,6304119046,"What struck me most while finally seeing CITIZEN KANE (as the only person probably in filmdom who had not!) was that the story of Kane I could trace in the lives of so many other high-powered moneyed public figures even to this current day! Newspapers still can control what we think and how we perceive ""reality"";newspapers still intentionally slander and try to discredit in order to control public opinion (now, even certain television stations!);how rich folk attempt to  control the movements of the rest of us and make us think that they really identify with us;how public persona and private lives are often diametrically opposed;how careers can be made with the sure and certain influences of wealthy people;how political office is often something to which they aspire......but most importantly,just how much these people are scared little children in need of their mommies and daddies and their sled!!!!!!

This film says it all. Yes this film is a marvel in cinematic technique etc,etc.etc,but for me it is the timeless message of the corruptibility of the average citizen resulting from the lack of early essential childhood needs being provided. That this story was based ""loosely"" on the life of mogul William Randolph Hearst almost seemed irrelevant to me as a million more ""Hearsts"" have come and gone and still are here in my own lifetime.

With the upcoming elections within a year, I am glad to have CITIZEN KANE for my very first time. This film only continued to confirm what I have always believed:that ultimate power corrupts ultimately (someone else said that first!).If ever a film was made to expose people for what they are and to aid an already cynical nature, then I am glad to have made CITIZEN KANE that most agreeable choice!

The extras on this DVD, a two hour film on how Hearst tried to destroy Wells and the film is priceless. ANY serious moviegoer needs this DVD in their collection.

798911,5,6304119046,"After the disappointing previous DVD release of ""Citizen Kane,"" which was gray, smeary and over-processed to the point of looking like it was shot on videotape instead of film, I was hoping the new hi-def Blu-Ray version would reverse those errors are restore the evocatively shadowy and contrasty look of cinematographer Gregg Toland's beautiful black-and-white photography. It does so, and more. The images are now perfect, pristine, luminous; the shadows are deep and black, the whites sparkle.  Faces that were intended to be in deep shadow are. With the photographic style of the film meticulously honored in this hi-def version, it is amazing how compelling the images are, and how they convey and deepen the poetic and psychological aspects of the story.  After watching this movie at least 25 times -- first on TV in the 50s (where its modern reputation began to build), later on 16mm and 35mm film, VHS and DVD -- watching this hi-def Blu-Ray is almost like seeing it for the first time, with the subtlety and nuance of the images visible as never before.  The sound is also perfect.  Pops, hiss, clicks: all gone.  Bernard Hermann's music regains its startling and layered complexity, and Welles' orchestration of every aspect of the soundtrack (using techniques from his years directing radio dramas) is a master class in sound design.  If you have one of the old DVDs, now's the time to upgrade.  On this 2011 Blu-Ray disc, ""Citizen Kane"" is brand new again, and timeless.",1194566400,,1484,4.959677419354839
798912,4,6304119046,"Up until recently I had never seen Citizen Kane in toto. I had seen bits of it here and there in arts classes and on TV.After watching this movie and reflecting I can only envision one man that could ever had played this part to perfection and that was Orson Welles himself. This movie is as much autobiographical as it is biographical,that is there is as much Welles in this picture as Hearst. From what little I have read on both subjects over the years it is amazing how much these two men had in common in real life in their personalities and their subsequent dealings in whatever concerns were of most importance to them at any given moment. It was almost art imitating life imitating art.
But in 1941 both came together in one glorious time which would never be repeated. The picture earned Welles and company I believe around 10 OSCARS(if memory serves) of which only one was issued denying Welles his just due. Hearst had won the battle but in the end Welles won the war.
On further reflection another thing that very much jumped out at me as I viewed this film was the cinematograpy. The camera work was phenomenal. The lighting,the angles and the placement of shots added totally to the entire feel and execution of this picture.
And another aspect that I noticed was the editing. Of course as Welles controlled just about every aspect of the picture this,I would assume,could also be laid at his feet. But take for example a scene which involves Kane and his first wife. It lasts about five minutes in all but it shows them sitting at either end of a large table. Through several dissolves we see Kane and his wife going from a newly happily married couple to two distant and cold individuals. Brilliantly done.
Technically this picture has been cleaned to perfection. It is a fine transfer. There are two discs here,one has the movie along with clips from the original trailer and opening night,a short interview with a co-star and two different commentaries. The second contains a special which(again) I only saw part of a few years back on PBS called:""The Battle for Citizen Kane"",which was part of the American Experience series. You will notice that this disc alone is for sale so it is worth every penny to be included in this set.
All in all I highly recommend this set to everyone. I have really no complaints in any department.

798915,5,6304119046,"And so we come to this, the pinacle of American film making. Often cited as one of the greatest films in movie history, and one that I saw for the first time only about three years ago. Does it live up to the hype?

God, yes.

Much is made, and rightly so, about the technical inovations in this movie. There are many and they are notable. The use of zooms before zoom lenses, the use of deep-focus, the appearance of ceilings, Greg Tolland's wonderful cinematography, etc, etc, ad naseum.

What really made this movie great for me are the performances and the story. Consider: Welles, who was young when this movie was made, convincingly manages to portray Kane at all the major stages of his life. Part of this was the makeup, but only part. Most of it was due to his incredible and forceful acting ability. Supporting performances by the likes of Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead (in the days before ""Bewitched""), round out a superb cast.

Beyond that there's the screenplay. Sharp, biting and well-written with a good ear for dialogue (not surprising, given Welles' background in radio). At time the story is laugh-out-loud funny, and at other times filled with great pathos. Yeah, there's flaws (starting with the fact that no one appeared to be in the room to hear Kane's last word), but who cares? Mostly what it is, is amazing cinema.

Yes, the iconic images help. When I watched this movie the first time, it was like I was seeing it again. I'd seen so many referrences to the film, particularly in ""The Simpsons"" that it all gave me an odd sense of deja vu. This is not a bad thing.

The DVD presentation is great! Wonderful, insightful commentaries and ""The Battle Over 'Citizen Kane'"" (which is worth the DVD price in of itself), round out an excellent DVD.

A word to people who haven't seen the film before, or who have but weren't duly impressed: When I watched this movie the first time, I could sense the greatness. I could tell it was an amazing film, but I couldn't quite figure out why. Then I played it with Roger Ebert's commentary track, and it all became clear.

798916,5,6304119046,"To me Citizen Kane is about the dangers of the self-made man and his ego.  America loves the image of this kind of man making his way to the top.  This film shows what often can be involved and how good intentions over time often become distorted by issues of power, greed and ego.  The Protestant Work Ethic has long been the bane of our exisitence in this country since Colonial times.  Combine that with a born again christian outlook and you have all the excess and extreme of the American character.

We claim to have no aristocracy in this nation, but are not all the Kane's, Hearst's, and Rockefeller's our eqivilent!  I would argue that the self-made man is more of a danger than any noble.  The self-made man has tasted poverty and wants to crawl his way to the top no matter the price.  This outlook, born out of the merciless Industrialism of the last Century has ravaged the natural resources of this land.

Citizen Kane shows us what total, uncontrolled Capitalism is, and how autocratic men like this run it, making any modern day King or noble sweet by comparison.  Watch this film for its brilliant camera techniques, and for the incredible stage presence of Orson Welles, yes by all means.

I still struggle with the meaning of the movie. But here's my guess (it could be wrong or maybe there are several answers):

It tells the story of someone who as a child had fortune thrust upon him and as a man tried to use it to do perhaps the one thing it could never do: buy people's love. Initially we think his enormous wealth is a blessing but by the end we know that it is a curse (and he knows it as well). And so who, where, when or what Rosebud turns out to be makes as much sense as anything else in this crazy world. And I thought it was very touching.

798970,5,6304119046,"Some reviewers have commented on the ""snobbery"" of some reviewers when reviewing Citizen Kane. I sympathize. But it seems to me that those who take any knock against this film so personally do so for very valid reasons. I knew plenty of what are considered the ""finest"" films before I watched Citizen Kane, and even enjoyed some of them. However, I perhaps knew very little of film craft and technique, lighting, composition, etc. before I finally sat down and watched Kane.

Like many have said before me (Ebert and and a whole posse of film critics online, CHUD for instance), it was Citizen Kane that made me a - I cringe while stating this! - ""film buff."" I assume the feeling is likewise with many of the reviewers here. Quite simply, so many movies by so many directors/cinematographers/actors would have passed by me along with their emotional resonance, if it wasn't for Citizen Kane.

It's true; you can enjoy Citizen Kane without trying to notice the innovations that Welles unleashes. It is a brilliantly entertaining story and still one of the best examples of non-linear storytelling (is that too snobby?). But the beauty here is in the details and the way Welles actually _makes_ that emotional resonance happen.

The reason so many people get so personal about this movie is because Citizen Kane is a cinematic gateway drug of sorts. I watched Citizen Kane, and I got it, and from there on in, I found it increasingly harder to be sated by the severely below-average movies that are being pushed on audiences now. I jumped to the Kubricks, the Bergmans, the Renoirs, the Langs, the Quays(s?), the Fellinis, the Melvilles, the Kurosawas, and blah blah blah. Most importantly, _I got it_, and it's because of Citizen Kane.

I don't think that the average filmgoer has to know the ins and outs of editing and direction and cinematography in order to enjoy some of the movies that are considered the ""finest"" ever made. But it certainly helps, and it more than pays for the effort. It makes you a much more attentive filmgoer, at the very least. It was when I first watched Kane that I asked myself questions like, ""How in the world did the camera move through that table? Has lil' Kane been in the window frame this entire time? Oh my god, has that lit window been in the same place the entire time (even its reflection, no less!)? Where the hell are the boom mics? Why is there a gigantic portrait of Kane in every other conversational scene? Have I ever seen a deep focus shot before?""

There is a reason Kane is still atop the AFI's 100 Best list. It is a 5-star movie, through and through. And if you have any idea about the amount of #*$& that Welles went through in his life just to finish his movies (if he even managed that), you'll know that he deserves that top spot more than anybody else. I think that there are better movies out there at this point, I think that Welles himself even did better movies than Kane, but Kane is still one of the best. It is a marvel that this movie still has the power to turn an inattentive college student into a perfectly attentive filmgoer. And hell, I still like Michael Bay's ""The Rock""...

798972,4,6304119046,"Love it, hate it, or be indifferent, Citizen Kane is clearly an American Classic. It holds such power in the cinema world due to the immensity of its themes - ego, the will to power, the American Dream silver trail from poverty to immense wealth, the overarching power and instability of the media, the effect of women and men on each other. It is a contender for the Great American Movie - just like the parallel battle for Great American Novel. This is something only realy done in the USA. No one speaks of the Great British Movie, or the Great European Movie - the same paradigm just doesn't seem to appear for the more varied, fragmented film industries over here. But in America you have to strive to be the best, the greatest. Orson Welles, a fledgling director and star knew he was grappling with something immense here, and he holds true course well throughout. The movie is a compelling jigsaw puzzle plot with fantastically original cinematography (for its time, though there is a big debt to early Hitchcock), that slots in place revelations about a complex, turbulent character of a paragon of the Great American Male. The rewards are immense - but the sacrificies can be ruinous. And what use are all those gilded possessions in the end when they're carted away and burned? The ego is fragile, consciousness transient, and everyone knows how even the greatest stories must end eventually.",1184889600,,1402,4.773662551440329

See it for Gregg Toland's lovely, pathbreaking deep-focus photography, Herman Mankiewicz's witty dialogue, and Welles's legendary performance as the enigmatic Kane. The film also marked the auspicious debut of several actors, including Cotten, Everett Sloane, Ruth Warrick, and Agnes Moorehead, superb as the mother who abandoned the future newspaper magnate as a boy.

798975,5,6304119046,"When wealthy media magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies, he utters the enigmatic word ""Rosebud"". An obituary newsreel documents the events in his public life. The producer of the newsreel asks a reporter, Thompson (William Alland), to find out about Kane's private life and personality, in particular to discover the meaning behind his last word. The reporter interviews the great man's friends and associates, and Kane's story unfolds as a series of flashbacks.

First, Thompson approaches Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore), who refuses to tell him anything. Thompson then goes to the library of Mr. Thatcher (George Coulouris). It is there that Thompson learns about Kane's childhood. In the first flashback, Kane as a young child is abandoned by his mother (Agnes Moorehead) when he becomes suddenly wealthy, and sent to live with his banker, Mr Thatcher, despite the misgivings of Kane's father.

Other flashbacks show Kane's entry into the newspaper business and his profit-seeking with low-quality ""yellow journalism"". He takes control of the newspaper and hires all the best journalists (which he gets from the Inquirer's rival, The Chronicle). His attempted rise to power is documented, including his first marriage to a President's niece and his campaign for the office of governor. A ""love nest"" scandal ends both his marriage and his political aspirations. Kane remarries, but his domineering personality destroys his relationships and pushes away his loved ones.

Despite Thompson's numerous interviews with the people in Kane's life, he is unable to solve the mystery; he concludes that ""Rosebud"" will remain an enigma. However, the camera pans over workers burning some of Kane's many possessions. One throws an old sled, with the word ""Rosebud"" painted on it, into the fire, the same sled that Kane was riding as a child the day his mother sent him away. There is a shot of a chimney with black smoke coming out. After this twist ending, the film ends as it began, with the ""No Trespassing"" sign. The closing shot shows the ""K"" on top of the iron fence.

Susan with a symbolic jigsaw puzzleCitizen Kane has inspired myriad interpretations over the decades. In Orson Welles: Hello Americans, Simon Callow argued that Citizen Kane should not just be understood as a fictional work but also as a post-fictional piece: a piece where the audience is drawn in to view themselves in the process of watching the film. In a 1941 review, Jorge Luis Borges called Citizen Kane a ""metaphysical detective story,"" in that ""... [its] subject (both psychological and allegorical) is the investigation of a man's inner self, through the works he has wrought, the words he has spoken, the many lives he has ruined..."" Borges noted that ""Overwhelmingly, endlessly, Orson Welles shows fragments of the life of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine them and reconstruct him."" As well, ""Forms of multiplicity and incongruity abound in the film: the first scenes record the treasures amassed by Kane; in one of the last, a poor woman, luxuriant and suffering, plays with an enormous jigsaw puzzle on the floor of a palace that is also a museum."" Borges points out that ""... At the end we realize that the fragments are not governed by a secret unity: the detested Charles Foster Kane is a simulacrum, a chaos of appearances.""

The film combines revolutionary cinematography (by Gregg Toland, with whom Welles shared a title card, which was a gesture of Welles' appreciation for Toland's overall contribution to the film, much like John Ford previously shared credit with Toland for The Long Voyage Home) with an Oscar-winning screenplay (by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz -- though most film history circles consider Mankiewicz's contribution to the screenplay to be far greater than that of Welles), and a lineup of first time film actors, associates of Mr. Welles from his stint at the Mercury Theatre, such as Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead. This a true work of film art and many have tried to unsuccessfully emulate the camera angles and the methodology of the angles and pathos.

A modern ""Tragicall Historie Of Dr. Faustus"" (written by Christopher Marlowe; the play, NOT THE MOVIE), this deeply sentimental portrait of lost love is remarkable not only for its thematic elements, but for the camerawork (considered revolutionary in 1941; expertly shot by Gregg Toland, who had worked on the successful ""Wuthering Heights"" two years earlier). This film deserves to be seen not just by film students, but by everyone. What a shame that this film was not a box-office hit upon its initial release in 1941.

Orson was only 25 when he made it, and even today its script, performances, and technical innovations are still fresh and interesting.

It's an incredibly cinematic experience, and a searing indictment of yellow journalism which is practiced way too often today.  The film has been parodied quite a bit (most notably on The Simpsons, who parody just about everything), and its reputation as the greatest film ever made hurts it a bit, and it is unfortunate that both of these things have a detrimental effect.

799064,4,6304119046,"I am 62, and ""Citizen Kane"" has been hyped as the world's greatest film all of my life. I finally saw it for the first time when I was about 20, and even though I was in college earning a degree in journalism, and this is a movie partly about the journalism of the early 20th century, it really did not live up to the build-up. I viewed it again around the age of 40, and appreciated it a bit more. Finally, I watched it  again last week, and totally enjoyed it...the writing, acting, directing, odd style of story-telling, crazy camera angles, and all. When I was in college, a popular book was ""Citizen Hearst"", a biography of William Randolph Hearst, who Orson Welles was satirizing with his Kane character. Kane and Hearst share many traits in common, but the movie is not a thinly disguised biography of the Rupert Murdoch of his era. It is a work of fiction, a study of a man whose personality was shaped when he was a heart-broken boy, and whose inherited wealth led him to glory, power, even more wealth, and finally ruin. As is mentioned in the film, ""Charles Foster Kane wanted to be loved"" but he didn't know how to get it except through purchase or pandering. Don't worry if it does not knock your socks off the first time you see it. It is the kind of film that a person who has lived long enough to have a few big failures, and a success or two, will appreciate more.",1178064000,4,1381,4.311538461538461
799065,5,6304119046,"Laying claim to being the greatest movie ever made is bound to attract extensive essays from cineastes dismantling the film every which way ad infinitum. Suffice it to say that Orson Welles' first-time effort as a filmmaker remains an astonishing and often unparalleled work. Only 25 years old at the time, he provides an audacious vision in which all the parts of this 1941 masterpiece fit perfectly together with a furious precision. Moreover, there is a consistently precocious tone throughout that a more veteran director could not possibly capture, and this is what makes the film truly unique. It manifests itself in several complementary ways, whether it's the groundbreaking deep-focus cinematography of Gregg Toland, or the propulsive editing by Welles and future director Robert Wise, or the involving whodunit quality of Welles' and Herman Mankiewicz's sharp screenplay, or the meaty performances of a then-unknown cast of stage actors. The beauty of the film comes from the simple fact that no single component dominates the other.

The result is as cohesive a vision as has likely been seen onscreen and one that Welles was never able to recapture for the rest of his life no matter how hard he tried. The film examines the life of a William Randolph Hearst doppelganger named Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper publisher who has amassed a fortune and more than a few enemies. The plot revolves around the mysterious utterance of ""Rosebud"" as Kane's dying words and how an investigative reporter interviews the people in Kane's life to find out the hidden meaning of that word. The interviews provide the means for selective flashbacks to his lonely childhood, his beginnings as a yellow journalist in building a publishing empire with closest confidante Jedidiah Leland, his first marriage to wealthy socialite Emily Norton, his scandal-laden run for governor, his obsession in turning second wife Susan Alexander into a world-class opera singer, and his sad decline at his isolated mountaintop estate, Xanadu.

The film combines a first-rate detective story with a classic tragedy about wealth and power and the inevitable ruin that comes from Kane's unrelenting self-absorption. It is startling how convincing Welles is as an aging magnate, and his naturally larger-than-life persona fits nicely into the Shakespearean contours of the character. The cast consists entirely of his Mercury Theater troupe with Joseph Cotten a particular standout as Leland. I always found Dorothy Comingore a bit too cartoonish as Susan, the character inspired by real-life movie star Marion Davies, Hearst's long-time mistress, but more subtle turns by Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother and Ruth Warrick as Emily more than compensate.

The 60th Anniversary, two-disc DVD set has enough material to please Kane aficionados beginning with two separate but equally valuable commentary tracks, one by director and Welles confidante Peter Bogdanovich and the other by film critic Roger Ebert. Bogdanovich is more academic in his approach even though he had the personal relationship with Welles, while Ebert can barely contain his enthusiasm with each scene he describes. The first disc also contains the original trailer, a brief newsreel of the film's New York premiere and three sections of intriguing material focusing on the production, post-production and the press book. The second disc contains a fascinating 1996 documentary feature, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"", which focuses on Hearst's attempts to ruin the film. To put it mildly, this DVD set reflects essential viewing.",1176854400,2,3576,5.336879432624113

The film basically was the beginning of the real art film, and nothing before or since has come close.

799068,5,6304119046,"For what it is, Citizen Kane is damn near perfect. But it really does have flaws just as any movie does. Critics rave about the camera angles, the script, the story.... As a film buff and aspiring filmmaker, I cannot discount the greatness of Citizen Kane. But it was only until such filmmakers as Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese, Francis Ford Coppola came along that we really did start to see just how influential this film was.

Before and after Kane, Frank Capra, John Ford, Cecil B. DeMille, and Victor Fleming films were really the greatest films in Hollywood. People loved the romantic, soft, sometimes-sentimental Frank Capra pictures... in fact, he was one of the many filmmakers to inspire Steven Spielberg. People loved the harsh but ultimately Hollywood vision of reality in John Ford's masterpieces (The Grapes of Wrath)... and we still do. Cecil B. DeMille was among the chief epic filmmakers... and he still is. Then Victor Fleming came along. I know it's hard to say that Gone With the Wind was all due to the greatness of one man, but he sure helped. His other great film that year was the legendary Wizard of Oz which is still a beloved classic for children. However...

Even though Orson Welles gave us the ""Greatest Film in American Cinema"" (again, I'm not stating a fact), he still cannot be considered the greatest or most influential filmmaker in the history of film. I believe that top prize will always belong to the unmatched master of suspense, Alfred Hitchock. None of his films suggests influence of Kane. In fact, he made Notorious with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman just a few years before Kane, and that film had some pretty Hitchcock-esque shots. He was his own great filmmaker, he didn't need any influence.

However, Citizen Kane has aged pretty well over the years. It feels real and somewhat modern, it looks real and modern, and it sounds like it could have been made easily today. But, many people have their own favorite film. They will attack anyone who tries to persuade them differently. That's why I think it is almost unwise and definitely unfair for AFI or any critic to dictate to people what the greatest film is. Nothing is set in stone. A lot of the ""know-nothing"" audiences still believe Gone With the Wind or Casablanca, Star Wars or Titanic is the greatest. Are these critics elevating themselves above the average moviegoer because of their extensive research, because of all of their experience critiquing movies, because they've watched so many???

Roger Ebert, who gives an audio commentary to the film... I guess he's trying to say that he's a film historian who knows all there is to know about can... he didn't like Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid. Now, that was a favorite for many moviegoers. He has the brass to put down a movie that so many people love and at the same time, he's telling them what they should see. When film critics can be that influential, I think its time we start thinking about discarding the purpose of such Hollywood bigotry.

Now, I have nothing against him personally, I like Ebert today moreso than I did way back when. He actually was one of the few who defended my favorite film, Titanic when it came out. But, he - like all of the other ""know-it-alls"" think they can tell us what is the greatest film. They can't. We're not all wise to the ways of film. We know what we like. I don't adore Citizen Kane, but I respect it just the same.

I've seen well-over 700 films, including a lot of ""great"" films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and I still prefer Gone With the Wind to Citizen Kane or Casablanca. But, they're all great... just different.

If you're a film scholar, you have to see Citizen Kane once. But do not be persuaded. If your favorite film just so happens to be Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, hold onto that, don't let the ""know-it-alls"" tell you different. I'm going to hold onto my love for Titanic.

799069,2,6304119046,"Maybe I just didn't get it, but why do people like this movie so much?  It's mostly lame with hints of promise and then the whole thing just peters out.

If you haven't seen this turkey yet, go rent ""I Love Trouble,"" which has the always sparkling Julia Roberts and the no-less sparkling Nick Nolte as a newspaper man (Nolte) and a newspaper woman (Roberts) who fall in love.

Nick Nolte has done some fine work is ""48 Hours,"" ""3 Fugitives"" and others in his numbered series (I believe he is also on the wonderful show ""2 1/2 Men,"" playing one of the full men, not the 1/2 man).  Julia Roberts is always a treat, and you may know her from ""Pretty Women"" or ""Hook.""  The two perform beautifully as they tell jokes to each other, write for newspapers, and fall in love in the process.  Is it their cantankerous relationship that draws them together, or the dizzying smell of newsprint, or both?  It really doesn't matter because this puppy is a real cinematic treat.

""Citizen Kane,"" by contrast is the weaker of the two films as it follows Orson Welles playing a man named Citizen Kane (hello, unbelievable character name, anyone?) who writes for newspapers and likes snowglobes, showgirls, rosebuds, and getting older and wider.  That's about it in a nutshell.  I know this movie is supposed to be really old, so it is a ""classic,"" but it doesn't even make any sense.  It's also kind of like ""Newsies"" without the music.

They might consider remaking this film and might I suggest Bernie Mac as an Internet newspaper man who besides trying to jazz up his daily blog has to care for two foster kids and maybe a dog.  The Hollywood writers can probably come up with some more details to flesh it out--I'm just spitballing here--but I think with a little finesse and maybe a cameo reuniting him with Ashton Kutcher, this could be a very decent film.

Gather together one hundred professional film critics. You can mix and match them in any way you like, from any country in the world and from any period of time after World War II. Ask them what the best movie ever made is. While there are very few things about which film critics agree, this is one of them: the choice by the overwhelming majority of your mix-and-match set of film critics will be Citizen Kane. (The website They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? actually does this, except with, as I write this, 1,365 critics. I don't need to tell you what the outcome is, do I?) That said, faced with actually seeing a film so widely regarded as the best ever made, the average Goat is going to have one of two reactions: either ""hey, wow, they're right!"" or ""what's all the hype about?""

Well, I'm your average Goat. And I have to say, I can see what all the hype is about, as long as I turn my head and squint just right. I like Pauline Kael's quote about it: ""it's the most fun you'll ever have watching a great movie."" Now there's a sentiment I can get behind.

Welles' masterpiece is great not just because of the movie itself-- which Welles wrote, produced, and directed at the tender age of twenty-six (by contrast, Muranu was thirty-four when he directed Nosferatu, Romero twenty-nine at the time of Night of the Living Dead, Riefenstahl thirty-three at the time of Triumph des Willens)-- but because of the politics surrounding it. I won't even begin to attempt to get into that here; the American Experience documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane (thoughtfully included with the 2005 Warner two-disc set) is longer than the film itself. See The Battle Over Citizen Kane soon after seeing the movie itself to get some perspective.

Note: here be spoilers. I assume the majority of those reading this, even those who haven't seen the film, already know the whole ""Rosebud"" shtick, but I'll warn you about spoilers anyway.

The plot: a media tycoon, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), dies of old age. His last word: ""Rosebud."" A newsreel crew working on a ten-minute film of his life wants to find out what he meant, and the rest of the film is members of the crew talking to Kane's friends and intimates, trying to track down the meaning of that word. They never do. Through the omniscience of the camera, we find out that ""Rosebud"" was the name of the sled Kane had as a child growing up poor in Wyoming, and that no one else will ever know this; the sled itself is burned by junk dealers as the closing credits roll.

Now, here's the thing. The legions of folks who say ""it's just a sled!"" missed the entire point, and that's how Welles sets the whole thing up. Everything from the early scene of Welles in Wyoming (in which, of course, Rosebud plays a minor role) to the final moment of the film is a red herring. Which leads you to one of two conclusions: either the mystery is secondary to Kane's life in Welles' vision, or Welles would go to any length to pull a fast one. (I lean towards the second hypothesis.) It's a fun red herring, to be sure; after the screening of the newsreel itself, which takes up the first ten minutes of Citizen Kane (and they are the slowest in the movie), it rollocks and bounces along making just as much fun of itself as it does of the larger-than-life Charles Foster Kane. And it does make fun of Kane; why else would they portray a media tycoon longing, on his deathbed, for his penniless existence in the middle of nowhere? But the claws are always at least covered in velvet; it's an affectionate sort of savagery, if such a thing is possible. No one the film crew talks to is overly fond of Kane, and some outright hate him; all, however, are forced to admit to at least grudging respect for the man. Now, think about that for a moment (and think about the fact that Welles himself is playing the object of all this scorn); there's a whole lot of emotional layering going on here. Solid stuff for a twenty-six-year-old kid.

Welles had a grand vision for this movie, and, given complete freedom by the studio, he realized it. He did, in fact, make a great movie. Even with all the perspective, all the historical facts, all the mulling it over for weeks and realizing the depth of the script coupled with the incredible acting talent, pitch-perfect production, etc., though, I'm not even sure it's my favorite Welles movie. (I have a soft spot for The Stranger, the Welles that never pops up on anyone's thousand-best list, much less hundred-best.) Yes, it's a fantastic piece of work, an absolute must-see, a thoroughly enjoyable ride through the mind of one of the finest directors to ever work inside (or outside) the Hollywood machine. And it's possible that no movie ever made could live up to the hype to which this one has been subjected. It's genius, yes. But the best movie ever made?

One of these epic films that is not meant to be entertaining but a catharsis with a lesson..

When watching this film you know you are not watching some one's YouTube video but a serious work of art from soup to nuts that is a careful psychological profile of an unbalanced billionaire whose need for external attention and impressive riches of grandeur overshadows what he lacks..Love and a meaningful inner life.

His need for power even under the guise of protecting the ""common good"" remains false and insincere and a mask of hype that money can buy success and renown yet in fact does not make up for his own lack of depth and purpose as all make clear to him in this difficult high art penetrating film.

This extreme extrovert seeks it all on the 'outside"" and his tumultuous lifestyle, loss of wives and friends,scandals,own peculiarities and eccentricities leaves this character a very lonely man in the dead cold as his world breaks down as he destroys all the external trappings of his wealth before breaking down seeking the security of Rosebud...a chair.

No bought hype or elected office title and approval from others will help this pathetic soul forced to look into his own reflection.

Is the American bravado and character parallel to this movie as critics often say? It seems that a one sided reliance on the trappings of wealth and power does not compensate for a happy existence as this film portrays.

  Kane didn't seem all that distraught by having his wealth and power. He didn't seem regretfull that he had allowed his life to lean this way. The people he interated with gave more clues to the man then Orson Welles wooden performance. All I saw was a man who wanted to do good and burned out early and yet I didn't feel none of the passion of someone of his position and abilities should have radiated on the screen.",1167782400,4,614,4.415929203539823

799178,5,6304119046,"Considered by many the best American movie, Citizen Kane is a story about a man's accumulation of immense power and betrayal of moral principles that guided that man at the beginning of his quest.

Citizen Kane was made by RKO Pictures Inc in 1941 who gave Orson Welles freedom and resources to create this movie. Orson Welles was only 24 years old at the time. Ambitious, controversial, stubborn and strong he created this movie going through a drama outside the studio, in the real world, as intense as the drama depicted by the movie. Citizen Kane is the story of a powerful publishing magnate who started his career by managing a modest newspaper to arrive at an incredible power and influence. In the real world this character is believed to be William Randolph Hearst that inspired the creation of the character in the movie: Charles Forster Kane (played by Orson Welles).

The main theme of the movie is about the possibility of a man to accumulate such a huge power that would transform such a person into a tyrant with unlimited means of dictating others how to live their lives and play roles that seem appropriate at the call of the moment. In the past, this fear of living in a society dominated with cruelty and caprice by a powerful magnate was present in many novels and movies created in the first half of the twentieth century. The movie might look a little bit outdated to the current situation. It is unconceivable that anyone could control the media with the same absolutism as Charles Foster Kane did. However, the psychology of possession of power remains intact and relevant today as it was a hundred years ago. The movie depicts the corruption of the soul that increasing power exerts incessantly on the successful person to the point where reality becomes an extension and a consequence of the individual will. If you become too rich (and too powerful) you loose the opportunity to become a great man.

I liked the filming techniques Orson Welles used in the movie to create tension, emphasise a message and to manipulate perception and tunnel your focus on a particular element. There is this scene where filming camera is rising above El Rancho building, going past an electric signage, and then closing up on a skylight glass with rain pouring heavily blurring the image below, and then as if going through the glass closing in on the Susan Alexander sitting on a table covered with white cloth. There are many other settings that will get your attention throughout the movie and make you wonder how in the world they did it with no computers, but only with imagination and subtle understanding of how human perception works.

Citizen Kane is a great movie. It is not something that will relax you, but it is a movie that will take you in the past and helps you understand a thing or two about the people that lived in that era.  You have to keep that in mind when you watch it because this is not a James Bond movie.",1166832000,6,2945,4.655769230769231
799179,1,6304119046,"This movie is very over rated and if produced today, it would seem rather humdrum.  I believe that this movie is as famous and/or popular as it is because of how the film was made, rather than content itself.  Allow me to explain, Orson Welles had a heck of a time bringing his vision to the screen.  He faced production problems and funding issues and other thorns in the side.  Once he was able to finish the film and the end product was like nothing done before, it was and is placed on a pedestal.  However as far as the film itself, it is so boring and insipid.  I can care less about a politician who is searching for his inner child and the demons of his past.

This movie was made several years before World War II; FDR was the president at the time and was rather very popular with the masses.  Does this mean that society back in the 1940s really cared about the ups and downs of a politician?  Consequently, many people could careless about FDR and perhaps politics in general.  Perhaps this explains all the hang ups that Orson Welles ran into during production of ""Citizen Kane"".  Take this notion of empathy ten steps forward, the majority of society in American today don't care about politicians.  Oh I think society cares about politics and the incumbents that drive the machine.  However, I don't believe that society cares about the demons and/or inner child of politicians that emanate behaviors and vetoes.  Society today is a bit more self-centered than that.  Just present this notion ""Rosebud or relief on taxes"".

I'd like to backtrack to the production grapples that Orson Welles faced when he was making Citizen Kane.  Just because he had a hard time making this movie doesn't mean that the film is great.  So Orson had some troubles making this movie, big deal.  Productions woes don't constitute a great movie.  If this were the case Ed Wood's ""Glen or Glenda (1953)"" would be a cinematic masterpiece.  Ed Wood had faced many of the same cumbersome issues during the production of ""Glen or Glenda"" that Orson Welles faced making ""Citizen Kane"".  Nevertheless, ""Glen or Glenda"" isn't remembered for its astute aesthesis, it is remembered as a campy B movie.  Which in some ways is sad, the content of ""Glen or Glenda"" touched gender identity disorder and transvestite issues.  At this point in time, during the 1950s, this subject was very taboo.  However, Ed Wood had the courage to pull it off.  In comparison of pushing the envelope, ""Glen or Glenda"" is more memorable than ""Citizen Kane"".

I believe there is a cluster of movies people love because they are instructed so by ""film buffs"".  ""Citizen Kane"" as well as ""2001: Space Odyssey"" (which was also a hideous and over rated movie) fall underneath these requirements.  Yet if someone states that they dislike either the former or latter, they are crucified by ""film buffs"".  Also people who proclaim they are ""experts in film history"" know that any type of slander against ""Citizen Kane"" or ""2001: Space Odyssey"" is heresy.  I know a great deal of film history and did plenty of film/video work both professionally and in college.  Despite my ""declared"" endeavors, I still think that ""Citizen Kane"" sucks, so I guess I'm not a cookie cutter.  Whenever someone states they are an ""expert in film history"" it is just euphuism for ""my opinion is better than yours and you don't know any better.""

""Citizen Kane"" is a slow moving film, with flat characters, especially the main character.  I couldn't careless about anything that happened in the movie.  I totally hated ""Citizen Kane"" and think this film takes too much attention away from other classic films.  With respect to these ""so called classics"" (i.e. ""Citizen Kane""), it really does seem that many people assimilate the views of others, rather than using their own critical thinking skills to develop an opinion.

Here is a list of some classics that are far superior to ""Citizen Kane""

1) Gone With the Wind
2) Psycho
3) Breakfast at Tiffany's
4) The Seven Year Itch
5) Scaramouche
6) Casablanca
7) Suddenly Last Summer
8) North by Northwest
9) D.O.A (1950)
And last but not least
  10) Glen or Glenda",1165968000,22,4144,4.731843575418995
799180,2,6304119046,"For years I had heard of this Citizen Kane movie. I heard that it was the one of the greatest films, if not the greatest film of all time. But I had always had my doubts on this movie. It seems to me that almost every film that people consider ""classics"" or ""masterpieces"" are nothing more than overrated, over-hyped films that aren't that great to begin with. After finally watching ""Citizen Kane"" for the first time, I must say that my opinion about these ""classic"" films are still the same. I went into this film with an open mind, really expecting a good movie, but that's not what I got. I got quite a long, boring film with a weak plot and storyline. Heck, I knew what ""Rosebud"" meant 15 minutes before the movie ended!!I found myself not caring about any of the characters at all, especially Kane. As many people have already written, I do give credit to Welles for the inovatitive camera angles and some creative lines of dialogue here and there, but I see NOTHING in the this movie that would make me think that this movie is ANYWHERE NEAR one of the greatest films of all time.",1165363200,10,1087,4.412935323383085

No problem. This film is not for everyone.

That said, I love it. It draws me in, and I think it does so because it makes me curious. I want to know more about the characters, and I am ultimately disappointed as much as the reporters are.

That said, I'm not too happy with this dvd. I had the GREAT pleasure of seeing aphenominally high-quality print at the Crest theater in Sacramento 15 years ago, a print that was used to the 50th anniversary video tape. It was clear, and very detailed.

This dvd is clear and detailed, but somehow just doesn't look right. It's too clean, too clear, and at times I feel that not just dust and scratches have been removed, but also details in the film. Somethings are just plain missing - raindrops disappear, and the opening newsreel seems to have been too cleaned up as well. It needs to look beat up!

So, four stars. Nice try, too much restoration.

For those who don't like the film, don't buy it.

Not to excuse his behavior, but Kane tried to control everyone while trying to make them love him because he had no control when he lost his parents as a child.  The mysterious ""rosebud"" was the name of his sled which he repeated several times in the course of the film at times of stress. He also recalled his most happy time of life which probably occurred just prior to being sent away by his mother.  He was playing in the snow just before he was traumatized by being forced to go away with a total stranger. The scene depicted in the glass ball of a snow scene he obsessively fondled and the word ""rosebud"" were his last thoughts at death.  With a lifetime of adult memories as a powerful, wealthy man and the lost love of a beautiful woman, what did he think about at the moment of death?

From its revolutionary (and still awe-inspiring) visual style to its memorable performances, Citizen Kane is a genius accomplishment. Welles, like a sponge, soaked in the qualities of world cinema (primarily European cinema) and used these tools to create a film that is unlike anything before or since. The heartbreaking story of Charles Foster Kane is the embodiment of the American Dream in all its glory and folly, providing a mature and modern outlook on the fallability of man.

I understand that there was a great deal of creativity and innovation that went into making Citizen Kane, but it was in all the wrong areas. The story, plot, acting, and pacing were extremely tedious, making Citizen Kane one of the dullest movies I have ever seen.

I do not believe an art form can be called the best of its kind if it does not, first and foremost, entertain. Innovative? Yes. Entertaining? No. If Citizen kane were a car it would have an innovative look, and innovative features, but driving it would be pure torture. If Citizen kane were a chef's creation, it would have an innovative combination of ingredients, and an innovative plating, but would taste like trash heapings.

While there has been a lot said about this movie, I will leave you with this. Place Citizen Kane before an average modern movie fan and they will be wrestling the ZZZ Monster half way through.

Ok, so here we have a guy, basically the Ted Turner of his time who has just died.  His last word is ""Rosebud"".  Now, everyone knew who this guy was, so everybody is going to want to know who or what rosebud is.  Some reporters assume that rosebud is a girl and therefore a major part of discovering Kane's true personality.  So, basically they interview a slew of people who knew him in an attempt to find out more about him, which fills the majority of the film in the form of flash backs.  In the end the reporters give up and the secret of rosebud and Kane is lost forever.  Now, What's the point?

Do we really expect this generation to give rave reviews to a masterpiece like Citizen Kane when they write glowing reports for such classics as ""Dude...where's my car?"" and ""The FICTION Code""? Aside from the sterling acting by Welles et al, the plot for this movie was striking and awe-inspiring. It encapsulates the consequences of a negatively-altered childhood, power-hungry ambitions, and an attempt to ""control"" those you love into loving you back.

The mystery of the investigation after Kane's death is enough to keep an attentive viewer's attention alone - but the devolution of Kane's charisma and the emergence of his frailties make this film one of the greatest ever.

To those who knock this movie, I simply say the following: Get an intellect. Lose the MTV/CNN/HBO shock-valued, reality-TV ignorance that tends to dull the brilliance out of a capable mind. Citizen Kane will change the way you look at life, love, and the consequences of life-altering actions on the decisions we make.",1149379200,10,1093,5.027624309392265

My sense is that this is critical opinion only, and that few ordinary moviewatchers like myself would think it even close to the top.

I must admit I have seen once, or maybe one- and- one half times only.

The whole mystery around Kane's last utterance 'Rosebud' and the subsequent search by flashbacks to discover 'who he really was' did not grip. I suppose this is because the type of Citizen Kane, the Hearst-modeled tycoon is not a type which holds any real interest for me. The aura of great wealth and power in business is simply something which leaves me cold.

So if the major character is not appealing or of greatest interest, then what can be so 'great' in 'Citizen Kane'?

Here I think there are answers which I as a layperson simply do not get. The introduction of 'deep focus photography'is one such element surely.

Anyway, case closed.  This remains the greatest film of the talking period, period.  The technical stuff is great, but the core of the film, as one reviewer noted, is character.  Character is the genesis of great fiction.  I ought to know.  I've taught creative writing for twenty years and published a chunk myself, some of it pretty acceptable.

But there is more.  This film gets at, through Charles Foster Kane's excursions and incursions, the essence of American Imperialism, which appears more and more to be the essence of the American Character, the notion that ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong, or at least inferior.""  Entitlement both personal and international.  Does this not ring anyone's bell?  Kane had his pet war, created by a corrupt government in collusion with the media...and we now get...?  Somebody shout it out:  Fox.

So if watching things blow up is your idea of entertainment, I'd recommend sticking with  games.  If you want to feel and think along with a movie that could have, should have, been made today, this is your ticket.

Also, you get Orson Welles acting with the bravura of a champ, not to mention Joseph Cotton, who is sublime as the innocent turned cynic.  And all the technical stuff that everybody talks about.  Yep.  Great.  Still, for me, this is one of the two movies that best encapsulate the ""character"" we 'murkins have backed ourselves into by neglecting to confront the dark side of ourselves and the society we've created.  The other, obviously, is that great film by David Lynch, Blue Velvet.  Quite a different film, but the two works have similar resonances.

Power, money, control, denial, rot, denial.  And then denial.

I also invariably find Citizen Kane quite entertaining.  I've watched it about fifty times, and laughed and cried.  I wince at the slow decay, the destruction of everything that touches the man.  Yet the early sequences with the young Kane!  They're hilarious, full of self-absorbed adolescence gone amok and gone on way too long, as one might also characterize some critics of this masterpiece...and who might see themselves a little too clearly, hence the negativity...and denial.  Nobody has approached the level of craft AND emotion of this movie and with Hollywood being what it is, nobody ever will.  Hello, Mr. Welles.

You might really have enjoyed reading ""Pride and Prejudice"" - but if you're forced to read it and told ""this is a great book!"" you might not enjoy it at all.

Let me say first why this is a classic. There are a TON of visual puns, lighting effects, production effects, that had never been used before. The in-focus effects were spectacular when this movie came out. It was an incredible groundbreaker - one that inspired thousands of other filmmakers. If you weren't around in 1941, then in essence everything you watch is ""based"" on this. It's like praising Edgar Allen Poe for writing mysteries, if you love mysteries that exist now. They draw their origin from that spectacular start.

If you were born after 1941, you might say ""well that's interesting, but I don't have to like the pyramids of Egypt to like modern architecture. I like Van Halen even though some of their songs were really written by classic blues artists 40+ years earlier; I don't like the blues original songs. I like current stuff and don't care about what it was based on.""

That is of course true, and a human trait. So if you're not a fan of ""tracing the roots"" of movies you love, let's just take the movie itself as a standalone entity - as the story of a man.

Orson Wells made this as his very first movie - and he not only acted in it but also directed it. He was a newbie. He did some amazing things in his very first attempt every to make a movie. To start with, you as the viewer are really ""drawn in"" to the movie in a way that most movies don't do. The interviewer is usually in the lower right, i.e. sort of where you, the audience, are sitting. You and the interviewer are both directly talking to and interacting with the people on the screen.

Kane was ""stolen"" from his family at a very young age - raised by strangers, sent off to schools and training. He grew up alone, with only some friends to keep him company. He decides when just out of college to run a newspaper, sort of a lark. He has great ideals - to help the little man. Once he gets a taste of power and public affection, he gets addicted to it. He begins to create stories that don't really exist, to ""make world events happen"". He starts to manipulate the people around him to get him more and more attention. When he gets abandoned, you feel sorry for him - but you also know it's completely his own fault.

These aren't just random vague events that are happening in outer space. They are very personal events happening to a ""real person"" - this was of course based on real life events of that era. Not only that, but they could happen to any of us. We all have tasks that we do, that bring us joy. We all have the potential to have growth with our dreams - but if we got that growth, would we do ""good"" with that power, or would we start to be tainted? If we had power over those we love, would we use it 100% for their own good, or would we do subtle things that made US happy and not necessarily them? How many parents, for example, pushed kids to go to a particular college because it appealed to the parent, even if it wasn't the perfect match for the child's personality?

This obviously isn't a hack and slash movie with a lot of combat and violence. It's a movie about the trade-offs we all make as we go for our dreams, find success, find failure, try to make love work. This isn't the story of a 23 year old having a fun college life. It's the story of the full life of a man - from sad, lonely young child, to idealistic young man, to a sad, lonely old man.

The way life affects us - and the way in which our choices affect our life - are universal concepts that are really important to pretty much every human being. It might be that some particular humans might not care yet. Certainly I remember for example when I was a teenager that I didn't give a lot of thought to the nebulous ""long off future"". Now that I'm a bit older, though, the thoughts of choices made, opportunities missed and long term goals are very important to me. Citizen Kane is a very touching portrayal of one man's journey through the years.",1142121600,6,4542,4.296728971962617

Charles Foster Kane starts out in life as a total idealist fighting for those whom are underprivileged and against those for whom society are its pawns. By the end of the film Kane has completely lost all his youthful idealism and dies a crass materialist,loveless, friendless, and hopeless - a mere shell of a man. Sure the film was a great technical achievement but the story and the acting are phenomenal, in fact, if this were not the case I wouldn't care less about the film. According to todays' standards of explosions and relentless action it would be considered a sleeper, full of talking heads. I would think today's younger crowd probably would find this film boring and stupid and perhaps that's just a reflection of todays' empty materialism and loss of values that seems ever pervasive in the West's nihilistic decline.",1141344000,2,986,4.910179640718563
799422,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane, like many great films of the period, usually require the viewer to gather at least some information about the film and its creation in order for it to be understood what an achievement the film really is.

Firstly, if you try watching the film for the first time without reading at least some information on it, then chances are probably you will think the film is boring. Like many old black and white films, modern viewers tend to think there boring because they lack many of the special effects the newer great films generally have. The film is old (1941) and the technology available to Welles (the director/writer/actor) was very limited. Also, some critics also believe that the film being in black and white also adds to the feeling that it maybe too long when in fact it is not. (The film is just shy of two hours).

Something that viewers should know about this is that the main subject of the film, though debated heavily by some, is generally agreed to be centered around the realities of the ""American Dream"". Succinctly, the dream of most Americans is too be born in extreme poverty (which was widespread at the time due to the great depression) and to grow up to be extremely successful which was personified at the time by being President.

World War II made the possibility of the American Dream to many millions of Americans which is the reason why Welles choose to portray the realities of that dream in his film. Kane, the main character, like the actual president himself, due to his immense success becomes separated and isolated from his real friends. His isolation becomes so complete that he sometimes has difficultly telling who his real friends are. The motif that success might not bring about happiness was actually an original idea at the time and played a major part in Welles winning the Oscar for best original screenplay.

Now, the motif has been so commonly used in today's films that the average viewer won't be able to appreciate the originality in it.

The film is also noted for being highly innovative as well in that camera angels used and the advent of the ""deep focus"". The use of camera angels to portray Kane's feelings in the film was a major innovation at the time that mostly goes unnoticed by most because it is SOOOOO commonly used. (For instance if Kane is feeling powerful the camera angel would view him from a floor view to show the he feels taller than the rest of those around him. And if he feels isolated, the camera usually shoots him from an upwardly angel to personify him being small and insignificant). The deep focus is when the camera is initially focused on an object that is near the camera and then is shifted to focus on object that is away from the camera (usually in the background). American Beauty, The Silence of the Lambs, Titanic, virtually ALL films (including the best films) you can think of have used the ""deep focus"" somewhere in the film.

Finally, this film is one of the precious few that actually benefit from multiple viewings. In fact, viewing this film more than one would probably be the only way you will be able to appreciate it, other than reading what has been written about it. I do agree though with what some viewers have said in that it is a major misfortune that it is considered to be the best film in history because many who do view it will try to criticize because of its immense critical acclaim.

If you like flashy, big budget Action films, with battle scenes, and explosions happening all of the time (Independence Day, Armageddon, Godzilla to name a few), you probably won't enjoy this film and I recommend you don't see it. To the film critic who has seen tens of thousands of film's in their lifetime a film like Citizen Kane comes around once in a century.

Citizen Kane is a film with a truly original story, (think of the plot in The Matrix), amazing film innovations (think of the sound use in Star Wars),  and spectacular acting (think of Charlize Theorn in Monster). If you can see that, then you will see why so many critic's around the world (even none English speaking ones!) consider this to be the greatest film in history.

799424,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane, stared by and directed by Orson Welles, with as pefect of a cast as one could make for each individual role, is widely regarded by many movie historians and critics as the greatest motion picture ever made. Well how well that arguement holds up is up to each individual viewer. What is undeniable is that it was decades ahead of it's time in it's ability to tell something at the time so original and flawless.

Orson Welles plays as Charles Foster Kane, and we see him from a little boy till he becomes an old cranky man. It's told brilliantly from the perspective of a reporter who's investigating the meaning of Kane's apparent last word, ""Rosebud"". The way this movie shifts is so non-linear that it required viewers to put pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle, but it surprisingly is never confusing in how it does it. Kane as a boy is adopted by a wealthy man, as a young man buys a news paper that he makes a mokery of, marries a President's niece, runs for office buy get's set back by a singer who can't really sing, gets obsessed by material possessions, and I still haven't begung to describe the complex life it unveils. The cast of characters do a magnificent job at surrounding him at different points in his life, along with being inteview subjects after Kane's death, but Kane is always in the forefront and his presense on screen is never topped.

This film is fascinating, entertaining, and mezmorizing at every single point. After watching it many times I still don't remember where everything begins and ends, but can easily comprehend Kane's life in luxery. It's a film that must be in any true movie lovers collection.",1138665600,4,1654,4.6416382252559725

FOR TODAYS MOVIEGOERS this is a slow movie, give it a chance.  The only way ""today's moviegoers"" will enjoy this movie is if they get into the story of Kane.  It is a good story and an interesting film.  There are even moments of light humor.  However, if you need action and don't care to think much, this isn't your movie.

FOR THE FILM CRITIC this movie is revolutionary.  There are a number of firsts in this movie, and without them, ""today's moviegoers"" would be lost.  For example, this movie was one of the first to use deep focus, allowing us to focus on both the foreground and background, adding subtle, yet expertly done images.  This allows the active viewer to foreshadow the events.  The deep focus, in addition to this being one of the first movies to show ceilings, allows Orwell to play with perception, creating scenes that are exciting even today.  Use of shodows and mirrors also adds to the illusions of Orwell.  Overall, this movie changed the course of all that followed, and that's why it is AFI's greatest movie of all time.",1137628800,4,1236,4.640552995391705

The young Charles Foster Kane loses his private, personal ""Eden"" (or the innocence of his youth and family connections).  His response is chronic overcompensation, which leads to meaningless material acquisition (Xanadu, newspaper empire, statues that never come out of their crates, trophy wives, etc.).  Kane's striving after power, control, and ""things"" (the fruits of capitalist society) stems from the trauma of failing to find meaningful connections, purpose, and love in his youth.  The film makes a powerful connection between the corruption of society and the corruption of human nature.  This states, somewhat simplistically, what I take to be the core theme of this masterpiece.  Of course, the greatness of the film is in its complex elaboration of this theme, through a brilliant use of the entire arsenal of cinematic expressive devices.

The very few American films since then of comparable ambition and technical brilliance (say, The Godfather Part II and Raging Bull) were not as groundbreaking or influential.

799543,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane is often said to be the greatest film ever.  I'd like to go further and propose that it's the greatest work of art of the twentieth century.  Here's why:

1) Film was the most dynamic and robust art form of the century.  Classical music, the traditional visual arts, and literature all entered an overly self-conscious, modernist phase.  Only film had the freshness and, yes, the vulgar vitality of such great nineteenth-century forms as opera and the novel.  It was, in short, the great popular art form.  And Citizen Kane was the best of the lot, the film of films.

2) For better or worse, it was ""the American century.""  And what work of art goes more to the heart of American culture than Citizen Kane, with its brilliant exposition of class, politics, business, and media?

3) Film is the great synthetic art, something like what Wagner dreamed of creating.  Literature, theater, the visual arts, and music all come together--and no film better exemplifies all the possibilities of this synthesis than Kane, with its great sceenplay, cast, sets, and score by Bernard Herrmann.",1132358400,8,1095,4.896739130434782

He takes all kinds of chances with lighting, camera angles and lenses.  The complexity of the frame within a frame, time splintering story structure has never been duplicated before or since.  Unlike a lot of ""great"" films, ""Kane"" is also very entertaining--dramatic at times, comic at others, but always filled with detail and invention.  Taking on William Randolph Hearst as a subject may not have been the greatest career move on Welles' part, but it does provide the film with an extra resonance for any American citizen.  Hearst was a great historical figure who had an important role in the shaping of this country.  When you look at the rise of tabloid journalism, attack-style politics, and televised celebrity trials, it's easy to see that his legacy endures.  Also, Kane's obsession with collecting and ""buying things"" is especially relevant in our culture of conspicuous consumption.  Like Kane, we all strive to improve our lives through acquiring more stuff, and in the end we are similarly doomed to lose all we have collected.",1132358400,12,1316,5.027649769585254

799662,4,6304119046,"""Citizen Kane,"" released in 1941, was ahead of its time in cinematography. Many long cuts, showing action in real time, fill the film. The few short cuts are taken mainly to emphasize dialogue. This story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane is based losely on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who fought the release of this film into theaters.

The story is not told in chronological order. The first impression we get in this film is of a run down mansion, inhabited by a dying old man, whose last word in life was ""rosebud."" The quest of the film is to discover the meaning of this word, which we discover has nothing to do with the lady-loves of his life.

""March of the News,"" a satire of the theater weekly ""Time Marches On"" newsreel, is footage of Kane documenting his lifetime, and gets the audience inside the life of this powerful, yet uncaring man. The story of his life is told through a series of flashbacks, some spanning many years through one dissolve. Kane collects statues, paintings, animals in a zoo, and a vast area for his home and castle in Florida known as Xanadu, based on the ""castle"" of William Randolph Hearst, who did his best to destroy the film before it was shown to the public. Charles Foster Kane is a montage of several real-life characters, Hearst among them.

Shot in black and white, this film uses the space of the audience's screen to show a qwell focused depth in the field of vision. Lighting is maintained through low key lights, and sharp angles of hard light, with characters all remaining in focus. Characters in the beginning of the film are shot almost in silhouette, focusing on voice and dialogue rather than the visual images. Symbolically, the public is in the dark about who Kane was. The older Kane gets, the darker shots become, reflecting a realism of cinema in the beginning of the film, but changing to baroque and excessive with the passage of time.

As a boy, Kane is removed from his mother's home because she has come into money, and wishes for the boy to be well cared for. In addition, the father is excited about receiving $50,000 each year during the boy's absence. The mother, played by a young Agnes Morehead of ""Bewitched"" fame, is solid, stoic and almost unfeeling at the loss of her child. Similarly, Kane does not visit his parents during the film, referring only to his mother's passing, and possessions he ought to go through. He is on the way to see about the family's possessions when he is splashed by a passing carriage and covered in mud. By chance a young woman offers him some hot water to clean up, and a relationship developes between them. Susan Alexander, age 22, works in a music store in charge of sheet music. Susan's mother wanted her to be an opera star. In this scene, Kane is a middle aged newspapeer tycoon.

On his twenty-fifth birthday, Kane comes into total inheritance of the sixth largest fortune in America. It is here we see the adult Kane for the first time, preferring to dabble in newspapers of all his assets. Mr. Thatcher, Kane's guardian and personal attorney, keeps Kane informed of his misguided interest in the newspaper which is costing him a million dollars a year. ""At this rate, I'll be broke in sixty years,"" Kane quips.

Kane and his worldy belongings move, claiming his previous editor's office as his home. To increase circulation of the ""Inquirer,"" Kane hires the top ten newspaper men from a rival paper. He always buys the best.

The shot of a portrait of these newsmen of ""The Chronicle"" dissolves into a new shot of his staff. Kane paid these reporters well to come to work for him. One senses Kane has no scruples, despite the fact he gets his way by being charming. During an office celebration, Kane dances charmingly with chorus girls, his dancing reflected in an elaborate shot with his image reflected in the mirror as his friends Mr. Bernstein and Jedidiah talk of him as a great and famous man, and all sing an original sone about Charle Kane. Kane leaves for Europe, and returns collecting not statues but one who collects diamonds.

Kane announces his engagement, and consequent marriage to the niece of the President of the United States, the dark haired Emily. He wants not only to fit in with the elite, but to have high society to bend to his whims. His is not a happy marriage, shown in a series of montage cuts over the breakfast table. His wife eventually leaves Kane and takes their son because Kane doesn't spend time with them, or understand and empathize with family feelings. Kane is newspaper tycoon bound.

Kane treats his wives like another

of his many possessions, telling the women what they are, what they will think, and what they will do. His second wife pursues a career in opera, which is a mistake because she has no talent. Her misery falls back on him, but he pushes her to continue.

Kane has political aspirations which burst like a bubble once his extramarital affair with the second woman is made public, and his first wife divorces him. The grandiosity in which Kane presents himself is actually very shallow, his work for his fellow man's benefit appears only in his early life. As an old man he is callous and uncaring of anything that doesn't have directly to do with him. ""All he ever wanted was love,"" recollects Jedidiah as an old man.

Kane is a man of wealth and power, and builds an opera house in Chicago for his wife to sing in. As well, his newspapers across the country give Susan Alexander Kane rave reviews. Only his friend, Jedidiah Leland, arts editor, writes a scathing review of her performance which Kane finishes as the man, his friend from college days,

passes out from drunk before he finishes the review. ""Some kind of friend he is,"" whines his lame songstress-wife. His was a friend who returned the now defunct constituion of the paper, written in the early and naive days.

Kane is responsible for the coverage, and perhaps the fighting of the Spanish American war in Cuba, saying he only needed pictures and he could supply the headlines. The ""Inquirer"" is not a newspaper of solid fact, but rather sensational items.

The second interview the report, getting an angle on a ""great American's life,"" is the interview with his second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an alcoholic night club singer. She performs twice nightly for a floor show in a club in Atlantic City, which has no patrons. She sits alone, drunk and getting drunker. She doesn't wish to talk to the man, but is finally persuaded on a subsequent visit from the reporter Thompson.

We learn of the meeting of Kane and his second wife on a street corner, as she leaves the drugstore with toothache medicine, and he has just been splashed with mud by a passing horse and buggy. Thety retire to her boarding house room, and his attempt at first seduction is quelled by her keeping the door open. Their relationship shown on screen is harmless, but the audience knows that more comes to pass between them. Kane loves Susan because she loves him, without realizing he is a wealthy powerful newspaper man. But, the more she knows him, the less she likes him.

Kane pursues the governorship of the state, expressing his concern for the ""working man."" His dreams for the Presidency of the United States die, but out of his grasp because his affair is exposed. ""A toast to love on my terms. That's the only terms that anyone really knows,"" says Kane when defeated at the hands of his precious working class, now represented by organized labor.

Kane is a man of wealth and power, and builds an opera house in Chicago for his wife to sing in. As well, his newspapers across the country give her rave reviews. Only his friend, and arts editor prints a scathing review which Kane finishes as the man, Jedidiah Leland, his friend from college days passes out from drinking before he finishes the review of her performance. ""Some kind of friend he is,"" shrikes his lame songstress, now wife.

Despite a palace of 49,000 acres of scenery and statues, and the still being built compound/castle of Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane, and he erupts into a violent temper explosion in which he destroys Susan's room. Kane lives his final years alone, in what Leland refers to as his colleseum.

As a group of reporters and photographers survey more possessions than can be counted, the audience sees Kane's sled, burning in an incinerator. Can one word really sum up the wishes of one's life?",1130630400,3,8427,4.661952861952862

799770,5,6304119046,"Like many others, no doubt, I first saw Citizen Kane in 1998 when it topped the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest movies. And being 18 when I first saw the movie (and being like many other young people), I thought Citizen Kane was overrated. I thought the movie was good -- certainly -- but great? Among the best ever? I just didn't see it.

Seven years down the road, however, I must admit that I've changed my mind. I just purchased Citizen Kane to add as an essential to my DVD collection, and having just watched the movie again, I must say that I now have a much greater appreciation of the classic film.

I still don't think it's the best movie ever, but I think it more than deserves to be in the top ten or top twenty. Certainly among the best.

All the discussion of film technique and groundbreaking cinematography aside, the STORY of Citizen Kane is a fantastic one; and to realize it parallels not only the life of William Randolph Hearst but of Orson Welles, as well, makes it even better.

In fact, if not for the supplemental Battle over Citizen Kane DVD included with this two-disk special edition, I would never have understood all the history surrounding the film.

All in all, I think Citizen Kane is one of the best movies ever made for two reasons. First and foremost, it's a brilliant tale of how a good man can destroy himself and crumble to nothingness (something from which anyone pursuing excellence in his/her life can learn). And, secondly, when Citizen Kane is placed in its historical context, it only helps to elevate an already great picture. From the story of its subject(s); to Welles' original battle just to get it shown in theaters; to its resurgence in the 50's; to its grandiose stature today; it's certainly a fascinating journey of how powerful art can't be held down. In the end, it will triumph and be recognized.

Mix those two reasons in with all the discussion of groundbreaking filmmaking, and you have one heck of a motion picture.

I highly recommend not only giving the movie a chance but watching the supplemental Battle over Citizen Kane DVD, as well. If after watching both the movie and supplemental DVD, you're not convinced Citizen Kane is deserving of its stature, I think that (at the very least) you'll understand why so many others think it is.",1129075200,8,2321,4.618932038834951

799772,5,6304119046,"It's surprising and a bit discouraging to me to see even defenders of this film (as opposed to mere trolls) characterizing it as ""slow"" or ""dull.""  The real problem, I suspect, is the experience and expectations of modern viewers.  One critic recently observed that most mainstream contemporary American films seem to be made for an audience suffering from a collective case of attention deficit disorder.  They are full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  People come wanting merely ""stimulation,"" ""entertainment,"" and ""escapism.""  And they walk away without gaining any wisdom or intellectual nourishment.  They aren't challenged to reflect on their life or their world.  In short, viewing these kinds of films is not an artistic experience in any way.  That's not to say there aren't worthwhile films being made today, because there are--but I'm talking about typical mainstream cineplex fare.

There also don't seem to be many ""auteurs"" left--cinema around the world has become more and more a corporate enterprise rather than the expression of an individual director's view of the world.  But the work of world-class directors such as Welles (and Renoir, Mizoguchi, Ozu, Kurosawa, Ray, Bergman, etc.) has demonstrated that films can be on a par with, say, great novels and plays.  These directors have used film as a medium for exploring complex human issues in an artful manner.

Citizen Kane--for many people the preeminent example of such a film--actually moves quite rapidly for the most part.  The opening dissolves create a sense of enigma and suspense, and the newsreel that follows utilizes very rapid cutting and a huge stream of images, some comic, some poignant.  From there we move fairly briskly through a sequence of flashbacks from the perspectives of different characters, each providing another piece of the puzzle and fleshing out the bare-bones story of the newsreel.  There are many movements backward and forward in time, and many scenes employ technical devices that are still dazzling (zip pans, rapid cuts, unusual angles, deep focus photography that creates multiple planes of significance, etc.).  And all the while we are penetrating deeper and deeper into the life of a man who had a huge impact on the America of his time--a fictional man, of course, but modeled loosely on William Randolph Hearst and not too far from such political/media brokers of more recent times as Ted Turner or Rupert Murdoch.

If brilliant, innovative, influential filmmaking and a story about politics, media, corruption, a sex scandal, and the inner life of a shaker-and-mover are found ""boring,"" maybe the fault lies with an audience that asks so little of film.",1128211200,14,2679,5.193023255813953
799773,4,6304119046,"I honestly enjoyed this movie. I don't think it was one of the greatest films that I have ever seen...but it is a really good film. The film's pacing had nothing wrong with it. The people who say this movie is boring are the people who are missing the point. The movie is slow to build on everything because it wants you to get to know Charles Foster Kane enough to get an honest opinion on what kind of person he is. It has good character development and the movie even views Kane from several different perspectives. These perspectives (shown through the eyes of other characters) give several dimensions to Kane. You need to pay attention to the meaning behind several things in the movie such as the importance of ""Rosebud"" and how that represents the time in his life where he was truly loved and had true happiness. If you truly give the movie a chance, you just might like it.

P.S. If you view the movie with no expectations, then you will most likely like it better than if you expect it to be the best film that you ever watched upon first viewing.",1128124800,5,1058,4.3979591836734695
799774,5,6304119046,This is probably the most underrated film ever made.  It's even more exciting than Speed Racer reruns.,1127952000,5,102,5.0
799775,4,6304119046,"When watching a film, the average viewer comes to expect a few things.  They expect a beginning, a middle, and an end.  They expect building drama and a climax.  In this film, they get both, only the film itself is the drama and climax--the beginning, middle, and end--and not the story.

Orson Welles takes all of his talents in radio, theatre, and writing and tackles a new genre, the cinema.  In the process, he does things unheard of in contemporary techniques and stuns critics... well, a few of them.  Most of the critics and the general audience ""didn't get it"", so to speak.  That of course doesn't stop its fame, for it has another pull that keeps it alive for years before it becomes embraced fully: a nice helping of controversy, both with the ""outrageous"" techniques and the, uh, political commentary.

Today, we have a film that will never die and shouldn't.  Breaking traditions in more ways than one, Welles has assembled celluloid with more poetry than what has come to be expected of cinema both then and now.  Still, poetry isn't always liked, and contemporary audiences may have issue with the general dullness of the story, for after all, the career of Welles and the controversy of the film are sparks and explosions, the Rosebud mystery is the intrigue, and the importance is the art-value, but the movie itself trudges along, hardly leaving room for any entertainment.

Part of this is intentional, and used to great effect.  The movie is, after all, about failure, and regardless of how many times we watch it, it is begun and end with ""No Trespassing"".  One problem modern audiences may definitely have is understanding that this film doesn't even pretend to answer its own mystery, despite the so-called revelation at the end.  It's an exploration film where the exploration is the finale, without goal.  Because of the perfection of the failure theme, the movie leaves the audience just as empty as the characters...  and then what is the audience supposed to do with it?

Thus, it all becomes a matter of approach.  This film should be seen, but it doesn't necessarily have to be appreciated.  It's worthy of its place as a critically-acclaimed classic, and yet it's still debatable whether it is worth it.

As for this DVD, it is an very good transfer and especially is required for the soundtrack.  For once we can finally hear why exactly she's a bad singer, we can hear his whispered death-word, and some more expressionist techniques are revealed.  Commentary tracks are interesting enough, I suppose, but the documentary is much more worth the time for seeing the importance of the movie without having anybody getting too nostalgic about the film proper.

799871,5,6304119046,"Cinematography: Toland was at the top of his game, and Welles was lucky to have so experienced an eye behind the camera.  Think expressive, meaningful angles, shadows, deep-focus shots--they're all there, a veritable textbook of technique.

Music: Herrmann, like most on the set a newcomer to Hollywood, broke the mold of German Romanticism (Korngold, Steiner).  Arguably this is his best film score, although Vertigo's up there too.  Particularly great moments: the snow music that suddenly goes from gorgeous to sarcastic; the clever waltz variations underscoring the darkening mood of the breakfast scene; the aria (which has been recorded stupendously by Kiri Te Kanawa, although in the film it deliberately isn't put over so successfully); and the way the main theme is hurled at you at the climax--always gets me.

Editing: Such energy & innovation here, particularly in the newsreel (a brilliant parody) & the rapid segues leading from Susan's apartment to the campaign speech.

Acting: Most of the cast had plenty of stage experience which translated into fresh dramatic power on the screen.  Cotten & Moorehead turned in better performances later, but Sloane, Collins, & Comingore are at their best here, and Welles's own performace is simply towering.

Make Up: Poor Welles had to get started at 2 a.m. everytime he wanted to shoot an ""old-age"" scene, but what they achieved here still holds up against anything today.

Narrative Structure: Welles started out shooting Heart of Darkness, and when the funding for that project dried up the one thing he carried over to Kane was the flashback structure, which has influenced so many things since, from classic film noir to Pulp Fiction.

Themes: All the brilliant devices are there not for their own sake but to serve the subject matter, a tragic story that takes on some big themes about society & private life, and it's this matching of form & content that really makes the film so enduringly great.",1126656000,14,1959,5.09375

That Welles raised film to a new level at age 24-5 is astounding, but his precocious work in radio gave him a different perspective on the medium and allowed him to use sound in experimental and expressive ways (that have yet to be equalled, really).  Of course, Welles does not deserve exclusive credit for this achievement: H. J. Mankiewicz contributed some of the best material in the screenplay, Gregg Toland was the top cinematographer in the business, Bernard Herrman contributed one of the finest scores ever written, and there are many other important contributions, not least from a very talented cast fresh from the stage (Everett Sloane's Mr. Bernstein I'd single out as the most remarkable performance next to Welles' own . . . both of them are aged so convincingly, and Sloane does it almost exclusively with his odd-bird looks and acting skill).

799977,5,6304119046,"I'll just make a few quick comparisons with ""the competition.""  Some of my criteria for ""greatness"" will be explicit, some implicit.  These, of course, are just my opinions, but that's what this forum is for: to exchange opinions.  First, I think a great film isn't merely escapist; it has to give us some insight into our reality, just as a great work of literature does.  For that reason, I'll drop popular favorites such as Wizard of Oz, It's a Wonderful Life, Star Wars, E.T., etc. out of the running.  Delightful as they are, they don't offer a whole lot to mature, reality-based interests.  Casablanca?  It features a wonderful script and acting, but the direction is nothing special and certainly not innovative.  It's a great film if you want ""a good story,"" but it doesn't offer much in the way of sustenence for the mind or cinematic artistry.  The American films that compete most directly with Kane in terms of sheer cinematic brilliance, such as Vertigo and 2001, are genre pictures with fantastic elements; they don't go to the heart of American civilization the way Kane does.  Ultimately, I don't think they offer as much, even though they offer quite a lot.  So what other film combines cinematic brilliance with thematic depth in such generous helpings?  The ""New American"" films of the late 60s and 70s give one a lot to pick from and certainly dig deep into the American experience.  Bonnie and Clyde, Chinatown, and the first two Godfathers are all obviously great films, but all belong to clearly defined genres (gangster picture, film noir) instead of transcending genre the way Kane does.  And their view of life is more bleak and one-sided than Kane's is.  To my way of thinking, they aren't as grand or as generous.  The constraints of genre also apply to the great musicals like Singin' in the Rain and the great westerns like My Darling Clementine and The Searchers (which are very great pictures indeed!).  Nashville, The Last Picture Show, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull transcend genre and explore complex American realities.  But their subject matter is more limited and less universal (country music, small-town life, urban psychosis, boxing) than Kane's (politics, business, media).  And one-sided bleakness is again a limitation with so many of the better films from that era, which lack the comic and nostalgic elements of Kane.  It has been mostly downhill since, as we enter the age of spectacle over substance.  I might pick Raging Bull as #2 for its stunning and uncompromising brilliance, but LaMotta is a dwarf of a human compared to Kane--a truly great man (externally) and a fit subject for tragedy.  He's an American equivalent, if you will, of a Shakespearean antihero: articulate, charismatic, self-conscious, and deeply flawed.  Kane, by my estimate, not only surpasses the competition in terms of cinematic and thematic qualities (i.e., human interest), but it also has one of the great screenplays and an original one at that--not a mere literary adaptation like Gone with the Wind, Grapes of Wrath, etc. etc.  Then, add to that an innovative flashback narrative, a great cast of characters played by some first-rate actors, one of the great scores (by the very great Bernard Herrmann), and some phenomenal make-up artistry (Welles himself is aged so convincingly, it has held up completely over the years--give credit here to his immense acting ability as well).  So there you have a few reasons why I agree with those who rank Citizen Kane #1 among American films.  Actually, if the studio hadn't butchered The Magnificent Ambersons (Welles's next project) it would probably be the toughest competition: Welles himself thought it was the better picture.  But in its diminished form I don't think it can be considered as great, wonderful as its fragments undeniably are.  Is Kane a ""thinking person's film""?  Yep.  The more you think about it and analyze it, the more you'll get out of it.  But it has a huge heart too, and that's what keeps us coming back.",1124668800,15,4006,4.934328358208956

I dozed several times during the viewing and when I woke up had to back up to the places where I dozed off just to see if I had missed anything.....(I hadn't).

I'm telling you I had tears of boredom streaming down my checks!!  There were no aliens or big explosions and no big stars like Bruce Willis or Jackie Chan.  It was even in black and white for cripes sake!!  It was all just so boring, particularly all that human drama crap and stuff about political machinery and newspapers shaping public opinion (I never trust the critics myself!!) and sex scandals and betrayals of trust.  Everyone knows the purpose of all film from all eras is to entertain ME, with all that stuffing between my ears, so what the hell was Wells thinking?  I mean does he really expect us to care about the corruption of innocence or to reflect on the American dream??  Does he really think we care one jot about subtle nuances of lighting and expressive camera angles or a complex, fragmented narrative structure that enacts the unknowable nature of certain human truths??  Or that old ""classical"" type score by Bernard Herrmann??  Why, he should have used some good rap music to liven things up.

Maybe, though, I'm just a troll.  In any event, my criteria for excellence should be evident.  I don't like films that are boring to a person who is easily bored.

As I said before, I have tried to watch this film many, many times and I fall asleep within the first twenty minutes.  To say this it is overrated is an understatement in my opinion.

How can we honestly compare this to the grandeur and scope of ""Gone With the Wind"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", or ""The Ten Commandments""?

800064,5,6304119046,"The short judgment I have on Citizen Kane is that it's a grand masterpiece. It lives up to reputation. Many are the souls of the cinema, surely, who have joyfully hailed it through the years as simply the best movie ever made (e. g. The British Journal ""Sight and Sound,""1982; American Film Institute Top 100, June 16, 1998 has it both as NR. 1). They are not wrong, they are not wrong...

That might of course be because of the glowing originality, or the splendor it shows in it's composition, the techniques it deploys, the bald and ferocious statement it ultimately makes on American and Western culture. There could be many things in there that causes the praise.  I primarily go for the substance and the statement it makes while focusing in on Charles Foster Kane's decaying life, more so than the technical aspects.

There have certainly been many other precious movies to appraise, Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, Annie Hall, The Time of the Gypsies, Short Cuts, Apocalypse Now, Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Bicycle Thief, Nostalgia, and many others. Notwithstanding these great films I can't deny the fact that Citizen Kane has the staying power and a tremendous impact. To me it comes through most of all as the awesome comment on the cultural life of Western societies, built by greed for money, where newspapers and other mass media supposedly are controlling our lives. The blind faith we also might give those at the pulpits -- the politicians -- is ruthlessly examined as it quickly erodes. What shows is what remains: false hopes and the tragic void creeping inside of us while only living for ""Western"" materialism that could never help Charles Foster Kane, of which he was painfully aware.

The crash of course on Wall Street 1929, and the ensuing depression years gives historicity. The years following the crash were depressing years indeed, before Franklin D. Roosevelt began ""The New Deal"". Equally it did damage to Kane's empire.  It's more than anything else though a personal tragedy to witness the inevitable downfall of Charles Foster Kane. First the fall from politics, ""caught in love nest with singer"". Then fall from marriage of Susan Alexander; the fall from his whole life, eventually left with nothing but a mansion in Xanadu, echoing so clearly the crazy falsity of hopes placed in riches or in comfort of empty materialism. The welth, what will it eventually do for our happiness? Nothing. Then what's it all been worth? You can forget about all the cinematics and the techniques of this picture for a moment while enjoying just the Kane drama.

There really hasn't been a movie quite like it since.

800202,5,6304119046,"If you have seen only the movie, ""Citizen Kane"", you have seen half a story at best. Like no other, the story behind the story is as powerful as the movie itself. Without it, this would be just another great old story, well told, high tech for its time and within budget.

From this two-disc set, we see a clash of two powerful men, William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles, each following his own misguided path. We see two great ironies. At a young age, Orson Welles knew the value of a good controversy - in show business, there is no such thing as bad publicity and all that. Of course, controversy killed ""Citizen Kane"" commercially. To William Randolph Hearst, ""Citizen Kane"" has to be destroyed. It wasn't. It became perhaps what the great Mr. Hearst is best known for.

This controversy raged in a time when America started losing its innocence. A time when all doctors, ministers and the Fourth Estate (to name only three) were not questioned as they are today.

Rosebud was the intended irony. The word Rosebud meant everything in the story and it meant nothing. It was a storytelling device. But what did Rosebud mean to William Randolph Hearst? Well, I'm not going to spoil the surprise except to say that it meant Hearst tried to have a sense of humor. Of course, he didn't. A sense of humor was one of the few things he couldn't afford. If he had only found humor in the parallels to his life, he would have been in a better mood to see that some of the story had nothing to do with him. It's fiction, for crying out loud! A wiser man would have laughed it off. A smarter man would have hired the primary screenwriter, Herman Mankiewicz, to write an authorized biography, which would have neutralized the bad publicity. However, Hearst wasn't built that way. Winning wasn't as important as crushing his opposition.

Experts say this is the greatest screenplay ever written. I agree. Experts say this is the greatest movie of all time. It is certainly one of the greatest but objectively, there is no greatest single film of all time. ""Citizen Kane"" is in my top 20 somewhere.

I have a single negative comment. My player may well be the problem but this DVD ""skipped and slipped"" on me. I found a ""solution."" I took a couple of intermissions, which allowed the hot DVD to cool then all was well again. At least I hope it is as simple as that.

800203,5,6304119046,"There has probably been more pearls of wisdom cast at CITIZEN KANE than any other movie.  I just did a book search on the title here on Amazon and came up with 43 results.  There are `Perspectives on,'  `Focus on,' `Casebook on' and a `Making of' or two, as well as a waggish `Raising Kane.'  Tossing out the strays - Jeffrey Archer's `Kane and Abel,' for instance -- that haven't a thing to do with Orson Welles' masterpiece, you're still left with a shelf full of books on the movie.  And that doesn't even begin to count the magazine and journal articles.

  So what's a rube to do?  Any `insight' I might offer on CITIZEN KANE has undoubtedly been gurgitated and regurgitated a dozen time.  The best I can come up with is this: The last time I saw this it was a cheap vhs tape and I remember disliking it quite a bit.  The Warners' Home Video disk is extremely clean and the movie benefits tremendously.  You've really got to watch a clean print of this one to appreciate it.  This will never be my favorite movie - or even my favorite Orson Welles movie - but I've watched it three times (the disk has a separate commentary track with Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert) and I've seen something new in it each time.  Not just because the commentators point it out, either, although the commentaries help in appreciating the nuances of Welles' direction and Gregg Toland's camera-work.

The two-hour long `The Battle Over Citizen Kane' documentary on disk two, an episode of PBS's `American Experience,' gives a welcome and complete overview of the controversy surrounding the production and distribution of the movie.  The clutch of specials on disk one - ad campaigns, call sheets, etc. - are interesting but, unlike the `Battle' on disk two, unessential.  CITIZEN KANE, however, is essential viewing for anyone with an involved interest in movies beyond the current hits.  I didn't love it, but after watching it three times in a short span I can now appreciate why it's considered by many the greatest movie ever made.",1122768000,10,2025,4.672316384180791

Its technological advancements are notable as the artistic talents of the director still us dazzle today. The choice of camera angles, the settings for the scenes, and the entire idea of a film-long treatment of a man's psychological makeup illustrates just how innovative and unique this classic is. The ""rosebud"" mystery holds our attention throughout. Outside of the film itself, the history of its production and release is nearly as interesting as what transpires on the screen. Frankly, I was surprised that Hearst did not sue Orson Welles for defamation, but then I read an article showcasing all the differences between the life of W. Randolph Hearst and those of Charles Foster Kane; so now I'm not sure what to think about the controversy. Anyway, it adds another level of allure to this masterpiece.

Citizen Kane is a powerful film that deserves to be studied for another century or more. I  recommend it, but, in my opinion, it is not close to being the greatest film of all time.

Film is an art, but it is also a science. And in any science, not everything is open to personal interpretation. For the most part, summer blockbuster movies are silly and stupid. The only reason they get made is because they rake in a lot of dough for the studios. They entertain on a base level and rarely address the human condition.

What most people are not able to do when they see a movie is separate what they LIKE from what is actually GOOD. Just because you like a movie, does not make it good. ""Terminator 2"" is my favorite film of all time, I like it more than any other film I've seen. Do I think it is one of the greatest? ABSOLUTLEY NOT!

And as for ""smaller, cheaper, seriously minded movies aimed at older audiences"", they are smaller, cheaper and seriously minded because they are most often a labor of love. An artist who really had something to say (and wasn't just trying to make 500 million dollars for the studios) got his ""smaller"", ""cheaper"" film made. ""Alien"" is your favorite movie...not the greatest! The reason why most people find ""smaller"" films boring is because they do not know how to read cinematically! Film is a visual language, and if you cannot speak a language, chances are you can't understand it. CASE AND POINT:  I'm not a mathematician. I can't read math. Some one drawing on a chalkboard explaining theories of quantum physics is likely to bore me. Catch my drift?

Lastly, movies are not just entertainment. They are a means of self-expression. If they can entertain you, that's good. I think it shows a great deal of ""self-centeredness"" when we can't look beyond our own desire for pleasure and comfort to recognize what others are trying to say.

800209,5,6304119046,"This review is for the Two-Disc Special Edition released in 2001 by Warner Brothers.

Of course to many, this is considered to be the greatest movie ever made.  I personally think Casablanca, the first two Godfather epics, and Chinatown are better, and possibly several others, but still, Citizen Kane is undoubtedly one of the great masterpieces of Hollywood.  The movie generated a lot of controversy and mystique in its day with the alleged conflict it created with newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst.  The film was also a groundbreaking movie technically with the great depth of field shots and upward camera angles showing rarely seen ceilings.

The story line is about the life of the world's richest man.  First, we find a young Kane who falls backward into a fortune, one that he initially wishes to have no part of, but is cajoled by his parents and his financial trustee to grab this opportunity of a lifetime.  When Kane is finally old enough to have full control of his vast wealth, he elects to become involved in the newspaper business.  His reasoning is that he believes he has a moral obligation to report the truth and protect and help the people who can not help themselves.  Kane even goes as far as publishing a ""Declaration of Principals"".  Of course from that point on, we view a man gradually corrupting himself until he's finally a completely broken man.  There are many moral lessons found in this movie which is another reason why it's such a great classic.

There are countless memorable scenes in this film and many great quotes.  The greatest line of course is the last dying word of Kane and that is the word, ""Rosebud"".  From that point on,  the movie revolves finding the meaning behind that mysterious word.  Some of the other great quotes include, ""If I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man.""  Another of one of my all time favorites is, ""You're right Mr. Thatcher.  I did lose one million dollars last year.  I expect to lose one million dollars this year.  I expect to lose one million dollar next year.  You know Mr. Thatcher, at the rate of one million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place -- in 60 years.""

Since the movie is so convoluted with flashbacks, plus it contains strange camera angles, visually captivating scenes and brilliant dialogue, it's nearly impossible to appreciate with just one or even two viewings.  That is why I would strongly recommend buying the 2 DVD Special Edition package.  This is actually the third time I've seen this movie.  The first time was in the mid-80's on the big screen in an art theater.  The second time was on VHS cassette.  In both cases, as I recall, the video image and the sound were poor and it made it difficult to appreciate and follow the film.  However, Warner's DVD transfer is perfect and the black and white tones are superb.  You will see some film damage in the newsreel portion of the movie, but that was intentionally done when the film was released to convey the illusion of an old, archived film.  The bonus features are also wonderful.  This is probably the third or fourth release of this movie on DVD and this edition is well worth the extra $10 or so for the superior image and sound quality, plus the extra CD bonus material which goes into great depth about Hearst and Welles and examines the great conflict between the two.  Anyone who appreciates truly great movies should have this particular DVD edition in their collection.

800211,3,6304119046,"The reviews on this site are either ""best film ever"" types, or ""this is garbage"".  In each camp, the reviewers insult the other camp.  Each camp screams that the other camp has no taste.

Citizen Kane is not, in my opinion, anywhere close to being the best film ever.  I've seen several movies in the last few weeks that I believe are better - Amelie and Aguirre The Wrath Of God.  I'm sure there are dozens more I would place above Citizen Kane.  But it does have some points in its favor.

It is the story of an extremely egocentric man.  Maybe that is redundant.  Aren't we all extremely egocentric.  Most of us are.  I don't think we can comfortably point at Kane and say we are so different, that we can't be compared to him.

One of his traits was a desire to show how right he was, how ""good"" he was.  That is why he finished his employee's negative review of his own wife's singing, despite the fact that it would hurt his wife's feelings terribly and even make himself look bad.  He did it to demonstrate how wonderful he was.  Don't we all like to be right, to show people up, to win every argument.

Despite his egocentricity, Kane wasn't a bad man.  He was actually a very good one.  Better than most.

Apparently the one thing he cherished most was the joy of childhood.  I'd go along with that.  I think the happiest times of my life were in childhood too.  Once we grow up, things start to get complicated and go bad, and we start to make mistakes and get hurt.

I never trust cliches, and it is a cliche that this movie is the very best film ever made, and it was produced impeccably.  I disagree on both points.  My biggest criticism of it is that it doesn't reach me, on a gut level, or on an emotional level, or even on an intellectual level, as much as some others do.

The first time I saw it, many years ago, it disappointed me very much.  Parts of it dragged, parts of it were draining.  I would have described the slow parts as ponderous and tiresome.

Seeing it for a second time, I thought it was worth 3 stars out of 5.  It is not the masterpiece it's cracked up to be, but it does have its strengths.

I will not join the masses bowing to the genius Orson Welles, just as I will not join the masses bowing to the genius Stanley Kubrick.  I think they are both overrated, particularly Kubrick, but when it comes to the word ""overrated"", Orson Welles and Citizen Kane come quickly to mind.

It's therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the documentary ""The Battle over Citizen Kane"" and the HBO film ""RKO 281.""

I'm amazed at how many people I encounter who have watched ""Citizen Kane"" once and thought it was just OK.  But seeing it once is simply not enough. This is true of any great film, but more so for ""Kane,"" a multifaceted work that cannot be fully digested upon first viewing. In many ways, ""Kane"" is the Bible of modern cinema: you'll find something new each time you watch it.

Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman's wizardry. Welles' Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast.

The expertly produced documentary, ""The Battle over Citizen Kane,"" recounts the factors that nearly prevented Welles' film from seeing the light of day. But it belabors the comparison between Welles and Hearst. Both were certainly ambitious men, and Charles Foster Kane is based as much on Welles as on Hearst, but the similarities end shortly thereafter. By repeating the popular wisdom that Welles' career tanked after ""Kane,"" the documentary glosses over Welles' achievements. Welles went on to make several great films, two of which (""Touch of Evil"" and ""Chimes at Midnight"") are often cited by Welles scholars as superior to ""Kane.""

While the documentary overdoes the comparisons between Welles and Hearst, ""RKO 281"" distorts the relationship between Welles (Liev Schrieber) and ""Kane"" co-writer Herman Mankiewicz (John Malkovich). Mankiewicz was holed up with Welles' Mercury Theatre partner John Houseman - not Welles - at Victorville, and Houseman was Welles' confidant throughout the ""Kane"" controversy, not Mankiewicz.  If the film simplifies real-life relationships, it remains an enjoyable - if somewhat lightweight - re-enactment of the controversy, with great performances by James Cromwell as the imperious Hearst and Melanie Griffith as the ditsy Marion Davies.

Back to the inevitable question: is ""Citizen Kane"" the greatest movie of all time? Quite possibly, though ""Touch of Evil"" might be even better among Welles' own films. But ""Kane"" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. ""Citizen Kane"" has topped the highly regarded ""Sight and Sound"" polls since 1962, and the American Film Institute reinforced ""Kane's"" #1 status with its 1998 Top 100 list.

800339,5,6304119046,"""Citizen Kane"" is probably the most discussed, most written-about movie ever made, as the more than 500 reviews in this column will attest.  Where you stand on its significance and its greatness is pretty much a matter of when you were born.  Most younger viewers (those under 40) tend to be unimpressed and wonder what all the fuss is about; while older viewers remember how there had been nothing quite like it in the history of the movies before it was made and for a good quarter of a century afterwards.

This is because the ""film-school"" generation of Hollywood directors, Scorcese, Lukas, Coppola, Spielberg, and De Palma among them, all grew up studying ""Citizen Kane"" to the point where every frame was memorized and incorporated so many of its innovations into their cinematic vocabulary that we now take them for granted.  Therefore, it's important to point out just what was so new and daring about ""Citizen Kane"" in 1941 and for the next 25 years or so.

First of all, as Welles would freely admit, ""Citizen Kane"" was a collaborative venture.  RKO gave Welles a crew composed of some of the best technicians in Hollywood, and Welles encouraged them to push the envelope and experiment.  A large part of Welles' genius in making ""Citizen Kane"" was his open-mindedness, his acknowledgement of his ""babe in the woods"" status as filmmaker, and his willingness (later insistence) on exploring new techniques or new ways to use existing techniques.  Welles' indebtedness to previous masters like Lang, Murnau and Eisenstein is pretty obvious.  Yet no one can deny that the cinematic techniques he borrowed from those masters he took to a degree and used to an effect undreamt of in their work.

The unsung hero in the making of ""Citizen Kane"" is, of course, cinematographer Gregg Toland.  Toland's use of wide-angle lenses and deep-focus photography became the most salient element of Welles' visual style.  But Orson understood possibilities implicit in that deep-focus photography that Toland had not imagined.  By mounting shots with a distint foreground, main focus and background in deep-focus, Welles managed to simulate three dimensions in a two-dimensional image.  Nobody, not even Toland had done that before, yet it is the hallmark of Welles' visual style, not only in ""Citizen Kane,"" but in all his subsequent work as well.  It would not be until Stanley Kubrick came along that somebody would explore and use the possibilities of cinemascope as effectively as Welles exploits deep-focus in ""Citizen Kane.""

The quick-cut editing, whereby a second scene begins with the logical reposte of something in the current scene has become such a standard feature of worldwide cinema that nobody even notices it anymore.  But when Welles ended one scene in ""Citizen Kane"" with Mr. Thatcher saying:""Merry Christmas, Charles,"" and began the next with him saying ""...And a Happy New Year!"" without a pause, it had never been done before.  Likewise, the fade-in, fade-out sequences where one character narrates a particular scene on one side of the screen and fades out, while the scene fades in on the other side of the screen until it dominates the whole screen is a technique common in movies today, but it began with ""Citizen Kane.""

One of the signature features of Welles' visual style, begun with ""Citizen Kane"" is beginning the movie with a ""processional"" scene.  In ""Othello,"" for example, the movie begins with a literal funeral procession.  Then there is that famous, long, uninterrupted tracking shot that begins ""Touch of Evil.""  The effect is to put the viewer immediately and specifically in the world of the story and its characters.  It's a technique Welles did in spades in the opening of ""Citizen Kane,"" as the camera (and therefore, the audience) processes across the grounds of Xanadu, from the gate, past the docks of the artificial lake, past the private zoo, the staturary, up the hill to the mansion and finally into Kane's bedroom.

Although no other director in history packed as much visual information into each and every frame of his movies (and all of that detail is significant!) as did Orson Welles, he could be an astonishing minimalist when he chose to be.  The most brilliant use of sound in ""Citizen Kane"" is when Kane speaks his last word, ""Rosebud"" while holding a paper-weight depicting a winter scene.

Then Kane loses his grip (a symbollic detail), drops the globe to the floor, where it shatters, while we hear NOTHING.  Then he dies.  The symbolism of the pre-figuring contained in this scene determines the course of the entire movie and encapsulates the humanity at its heart.  ""What does it profit a man should he gain the whole world while losing his soul?""",1115510400,8,4710,4.979565772669221

It has a special place in film history for the innovative approach employed at the time it was released in 1941. From my perspective, this film should be on the summer viewing lists for every high school student.

800478,3,6304119046,"I have seen this film at the top(or near) of nearly every film list I've ever seen.  Prior to my viewings of the film, a few of my friends(who also take a keen interest in films) urged me to watch it attentively.  Having seen the film twice now, I can't help but doubt film-critics calling this film the best of all time.  Perhaps this is a result of my youth and ignorance, but I suspect the movie has aged poorly and that people of my generation will never truly appreciate this film.

  Citizen Kane meets all the criteria of a classic film, the most important of which is: it deals with themes that are universal.  That is, Kane's ambitions, the corruption of politicians, and the general human desire to be loved.  Unfortunately, Welles makes a few missteps in executing these ideas and he tends to concentrate on irrelevancies such as his second wife's attempt at becoming an opera singer.  Perhaps some movie-goers find this suitable, but it is my firm conviction that a film should include scenes which are relevant to the development of the film, and that everything else should be scrapped.  Had Welles concentrated further on his Newspaper organization, and less on his domestic affairs, the plot would seem a lot more coherent.  As a result, it is not clear exactly what Welles is trying to say with this film.  With films like The Godfather, the implications were clear: organized crime is another form of American business.  Taxi Driver implies that loneliness is an ineviatable state of the human race.  This film on the other hand, can't quite make up its mind as to what it wants to get across.

  My own feeling is that this film has too many flaws to be really considered on the same level as say ""The Godfather"", ""Seven Samurai"", or ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"".  The crucial difference being, not only do those films know what they want to say, but the manner in which they say those things is meticulous and free of any redundant words.",1115251200,4,1963,4.624277456647399

If you want Special Effects Extravaganzas don't see this film. Citizen Kane was made in the 1940's and its style in both the screenplay and direction have continued up to the present.  The Simpsons steals heavily on Citizen Kane.  Camera angles and even scenes are lifted out and are used for much the same effect as they were used in the original film.  So the influence this film has on those in the industry today is staggering.

  On ""Rosebud"": A journalist interviews all who knew Kane in order to find out what Kane's dying words meant.  At the end of the film we know who or what ""Rosebud"" is but is it significant or not?",1111795200,,799,4.570422535211268
800483,5,6304119046,"This was the film that almost never was. Orson Welles, an accomplished radio personality was given a really extraordinary deal by RKO Studios. Basically he had complete control over his projects, final say on the final cut, whatever actors he wanted and could write, star and direct this film. However, it was too closely related to the life of a newspaper tycoon that he wanted it destroyed. And how's this for irony: the ""greatest film ever made"" was actually booed whenever one of it's 9 Oscar nominations were announced on stage.

The movie starts out famously with Charles Foster Kane, an old man clutching a snow globe and muttering ""Rosebud"" before dying. A news reporter wants to find out what was so special about this word, could mean anything, could mean nothing. So we find a man named Thompson visiting people who knew Kane and see if he can unravel the mystery.

While it may not look like since it's been near 60 years since the film came out, there was a lot of new camera techniques and lighting on the film. One it introduced was deep focus photography, where everything in front of the camera and everything way in the background were in focus, which was new since it was usually one's clear, one isn't.

Also with the help of deep focus, certain scenes suggest something without saying it. There's a shot where Kane is signing away control to his fortune so he doesn't by everything in sight and in the room behind is what looks like a standard sized room with a standard sized mirror. However he walks closer to the mirror and you find out it's a big damn mirror with the top of it being close to 20 feet above his head. Another scene is in regards to a massive fireplace same concept.

There's the infamous political rally where he just basically had a painting, punched some holes and moved lights around to simulate movement. When Kane meets his 2nd wife his face is fully lit, but when things start to go little sour, he's backlit(meaning his face is in shadow). There's many more of these(for example in the opening scene there's one window that is always in the same place every single frame despite we're getting closer to the mansion.

All this talk of the technological feats and not a word about the film itself. To be honest, it's a good film. It's not ""holy $%#@ that's the best film eva!"" but it's not horrible. You watch it and it's not a moving film, it's just really well done.

Also, check out the Ebert commentary. Say what you want about his tastes but he does know film. He's like an encyclopedia almost bringing details that you'd think ""why would he know that? and how?"" He also gets into the technical shots and how they were done which is quite different for a critic.

Anyway you look at it, it is a quite well-made film, it's just it may not be everyone's cup of tea but there's a lot of people who seem to like this cup.

The only real problem I have is that the it isn't a color version too. I know there's one out there because I saw it on television in the 80s. When DVD is supposed to be the definitive version aren't we allowed to choose to see color as God intended through our God-given eyes? I know everything isn't grey, althogh some people would have you believe the same. I think the black and white version is fine too it looks kinda neat but I wish we could watch any version and the magic of Dvd usually provides this, let alone the wide skinny kind and full boxy kind of movie which this also doesn't have, but I don't mind that as much because let's face it, a black and white movie would look funny if they stretched it all skinny like a color movie like 2001: a space Odyssy.

No, this film is not over-rated, nor is it boring. It may be too ponderous for some tastes, and that's fine, but it really IS one of the greatest classics in film history: aside from breaking every rule of cinema storytelling up until that time (the episodic format jumps back and forth in time, a style not really re-ignited in movies until the '90s) but moved significantly forward in terms of camera-work... Yes, younger viewers might not recognize these things today, but the story (loosely based on the life of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst--- Patty's granddaddy) is a sweeping portrait/satire of super-wealth at the beginning of the 20th century.

That one simple thing could have stood out before he died and the simple things in life. The meaning , etc.. I don't know many my age who could probably sit through Citizen Kane and follow it. Im 22 years old. It is very long and it might be boring to some my age. It was made in 41. I noticed the great camera shots and scenes throughout the movie. Orson was gifted to write , direct and star in such a good movie at such an early age. I admire the camera work and plot of the movie but I just wished they wouldve told us more about Rosebud and explained. But then again maybe that would take away from the movie , I think its meant to leave us with mystery about rosebud and to actually think about it. Serious film buffs will love this movie. The one reviewer called it an ( aquired taste). So I Would definetly rent this before you buy. I bought it cause I wanted to see the greatest movie of all time instead i watched and felt a diffrent feeling.

800615,4,6304119046,"Citizen Kane is regarded as one of the best American movies of all time, if not the best.  After seeing it for the first time, at first I couldn't quite see why.  Sure, it featured innovative technology for its time, but these innovations go largely unnoticed by all except film historians.  And sure, it is clever at times.  And it does seem to bring a powerful message about a man's lust for power and satisfaction in material things, a fruitless quest which ends in emptiness and misery.  I suppose it is brutally honest in showing how a man's idols can fail him, but there is no note of hope or redemption.  But perhaps this is the kind of movie that classifies as art instead of entertainment, and bears the most rewards on multiple viewings.

The story-line begins with the death of the wealthy media magnate Charles Foster Kane (modeled somewhat after William Randolph Hearst, who fought to prevent the film from being shown).  Appropriately, it is up to journalists to tell his story, and in their quest to summarize his life, a reporter searches for the significance of his dying word, ""Rosebud"".  The quest is not successful, but this is a clever device to present Kane's life as the fruit of media inquiry, with interviews and flashbacks.  *Spoiler* The final scene does solve the mystery, where it becomes evident that Rosebud is the name of the snow sled from Kane's childhood.  Kane was taken from his mother as a young boy, and entrusted into the custody of a rich industrialist, leaving his family in order to embark on his quest for greatness and power.  This pursuit resulted in the accumulation of many worldly goods, but no happiness.  As others have pointed out, the tragedy of Kane's life illustrates the truth of what the Bible says in Mark 8:36 ""For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?"" On this level ""Citizen Kane"" is a powerful movie with deep symbolism, showing how a man deprived of love from childhood is given money and power, but enters the depths of despair when he finds that it can't buy love or happiness.

Certainly this is a message worth hearing, especially in a world where many put their hope in riches and power.  But while ""Citizen Kane"" shows us the emptiness of Kane's life, it offers no alternative.  Like the book of Ecclesiastes, the pursuit of Kane's happiness in earthly things ends only in misery, meaningless, and a vanity of vanities.  But unlike the Bible book, the films concludes with a tragic finale with no sense of hope.  Citizen Kane is brilliant in showing the emptiness of life lived apart from God, but in the end it is a dark movie where the light of the gospel is absent.  It has to be admitted that Kane's life is not a pretty picture, and the tragedy of his life is neither pleasant nor entertaining.  If you're looking for entertainment, don't watch Citizen Kane.  But if you're looking for art with a powerful message and don't mind the absence of a final note of hope, look no further than Citizen Kane. -GODLY GADFLY",1104192000,6,3029,4.6138059701492535
800616,5,6304119046,"A few weeks ago I had the astounding honor of fulfilling one of my lifelong goals; I met Roger Ebert.

Me and my co-directing friend went to the Savannah Film festival with big cheezy grins on our faces. We were going to have a once in a lifetime opportunity to go through a shot-by-shot question and answer session with Roger Ebert. That in itself was incredible, and more than enough to keep this Alabama boy happy the rest of his days. I have spent the last decade reading his reviews, along with millions of other folks every week. He is arguably the number one personal source of information on Citizen Kane. So respected in fact, he was given the task to have an informative commentary track on the disk, which any fan of the film should listen to.

We had to throw around a few bargains, but finally we krept our way to the front row. In front of me, the stool in which he was going to sit on. Most excellent, right? Wrong, that's nothing - just the beginning. Behind me, a voice was heard amongst the others in the packed theater. ""Thats where he sat last night."" To my amazement he was pointing to the chair directly beside me. I choked as they brought in a microphone and placed it in front of the seat to my right. I was going to watch what the American Film Institute calls ""the greatest movie of all time"", with one of the most respected Critics of all time.

Sure enough, he came in and gave a brief bow. ""Peter O' Toole was here wednesday, and let me tell you, he is a pro at taking applause. First he gracefully entered bowing then, once he had sat down, he noticed the balcony, so he stood once more with a surprised expression on his face as if he didn't deserve it. He is the master."" Likewise he did so to the balcony.

Ebert was very nice, and if he were to stop reviewing, he would have no trouble finding work as a stand-up comedian. Popping the Citizen Kane disk out and placing it in the player, he kept the crowd rolling with anecdotes. Anything from why watching weekly citcoms is a sin, to the absurdity of yearly sports. He is anti-cycle. ""Watching three episodes of Seinfield is a good thing. Watching every episode of seinfield is a waste of life. Watch a movie, listen to music, have a picnic, make love to your spouse... anything!""

Ofcourse there were some unhappy groans, but hey, he was honest and unpolitically correct, which anyone should give him credit for. Finally, ""Lets get the movie going.""

He sat down beside me. There was a brief exchange of nods as the lights went down. The rules to the question and answer session is, as the movie rolls if you have a comment or question you yell out ""STOP!"" And so he does, then the question is asked.

I was able to decifer some of the unintelligable questions for Ebert, because it was a packed house and some of the voices were very faint. One person caused a laughing riot when he compared the little monkey dolls in the wife's room with the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz; As if there was some intentional link between them. Ebert replied, ""That is something you have to decide between you and your conspirator."" The voice lashed out, ""In this case, that would be you!"" ""Uh oh,"" Ebert laughed to himself.

There were many facts unearthed during the session. Some that even he, after over a hundred viewings, hadn't realized. Such as ""the ranch"" mentioned earlier in the film held the same name as the bar his wife is drinking in during her talk with the newspaper man. Also shot in which main characters are seen as the camera pulls back through a window. A hand is barely seen removing a chair from the way of the camera. Very neat information for fans. These discoveries led to applause towards the discovering audience members. Later these were put in his own essay about the festival.

""The sled in the film was purchased at auction by Steven Spielberg."" I was shocked. I leaned over to him, ""I was the one who sent you the e-mail about that when it happened."" He was surprised, ""Really?"" Then he want back to the Q and A. I supposed he was just humoring me, because he is no doubt use to the crazies out there. So I left it at that.

Once the film ended and he had said his last words, the crowd stood up and raced towards him. To my surprise, he walked over to me, ""So, you sent me that e-mail?"" He really remembered. Out of all of the thousands of e-mails, he plucked from his memory, my letter. ""Yes sir,"" I said. ""Wow, and I replied right?"" he asked. ""Yes, you said 'thanks for the information'. That 'news about the sled interested you greatly'.""

I knew the people standing around us were growing angry, but we continued to talk. After all was said and done, my friend and I received autograph's and a picture which you can see at hideawayfilms dot com. He gave us almost all the time he had, and for all of these things I am extremely grateful. I know it took an act of God to bring all of this together so perfectly, and to him I am forever in debt.

Watching Citizen Kane was an incredible experience that everyone should take part in atleast once. If you don't like it, that's fine, you know my opinion. Give the commentary a shot, it's a wealth of information that will help in your pursuit for film knowledge. Kane is the standard by which many filmakers, including myself, have set for themselves.

The American Film Institute made this film the #1 film of all time. Why?

But Welles, and the very tender age of 25, managed to turn out an extraordinary gem, radical for its time with its use of deep focus, flashback editing, and unique camera angles.  Pauline Kael, who wrote a wonderful book on this film, once called ""Citizen Kane"" a shallow masterpiece.  This may be a weakness, in that it may not offer all the intellectual fodder of Fellini's ""8 1/2,"" but it is also a strength.  For few films in the history of cinema have managed to offer substantive creativity and thoroughly enjoyable content, both at the same time.  It is the one masterpiece I actually have fun watching.

800765,5,6304119046,"It doesn't take long to realize that even the best movies have their detractors.  When ""Citizen Kane"" topped the list of the 100 best American movies of all time, there were a few critics of a choice that many felt did not appeal to the majority of American movie-goers.  Fair enough although ""Citizen Kane"" certainly has a story that is a lot easier to follow and enjoy that most of the ""artistic"" movies of the last century. It does seem to slow down at times but this is one of those movies that reveals more and more about itself each time you view it.

It is as though the puzzle of the movie is also a puzzle for the movie audience.  What did Kane mean by the dying word, ""Rosebud""?  Well, everyone who saw it through to the end certainly got a big clue but did that really tell everything there is or was it just a big hint to the larger story hidden in the movie itself?  As we watch the reporter trying to find the answers, we can see inside the story to the many insights hidden throughout the film.  Every time we see it again, the picture becomes clearer.  It isn't just that Kane wanted his childhood back; in many ways he was reliving his childhood as an adult with bigger toys but just as much enthusiasm.  It isn't just that he wanted love that was real; it was clear that he was unable to handle the love he received.  It is a far more complex picture that we have before us than most of us comprehend the first time or two through the reels.  Perhaps it is best to leave it at its' simpler messages but that is to miss the appreciation for the intentional complexity given it by its' creator, Orson Welles.

There are many examples beyond just the story itself as to why ""Citizen Kane"" is such a classic; the camera angles and perspectives, to name one.  However, as much as I appreciate the cinematic innovations, I am fascinated by the story and the many insights to life itself that are revealed in this classic.  This is not necessarily a movie I stop at if I come across it while changing channels.  Sometimes I'm just not up for it, preferring, instead, something lighter for my tired mind.  However, when I want to appreciate just how well all the elements of a great movies can come together in near perfection, I chose to watch ""Citizen Kane"".  It may have a few faults (such as who the heck was there to have heard him utter the work ""Rosebud""?).  However, the faults are almost embarassing to mention compared with the magnitude of its' achievements.  This is a movie everyone should see at least twice.",1097625600,7,2532,4.383297644539614

800767,5,6304119046,"""Citizen Kane"" has always been enigmatic to me.  There is no denying that when this film was released in 1941 it was light-years ahead of other films in regard to technique, story-telling, and enough cannot be said about the superlative cinematography by Gregg Toland.  The screenplay by Herman Mankiewicz is superb.  The ensemble acting by the Mercury Theatre troupe is outstanding. Orson Welles had to have the most chutzpah in the world to make a veiled biography of William Randolph Hearst, one of the most powerful men in the world at this time.  But is this (bold letters for effect)THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL-TIME?  In all likelihood, yes.  That said, I would not rank it as one of my favorite films but one I deeply admire.  With apologies to Roger Ebert, this film can probably be best viewed in a film course where it can be analyzed and dissected.  It may just be me, but I hold ""The Godfather"" in higher esteem, a film that is both art and entertains.  A film by Orson Welles that I enjoy more is ""A Touch of Evil"" because it has higher entertainment value(and atmosphere to die for).  Another recommendation for Welles fans is ""The Third Man"", a film that Welles appears in but did not direct but it sure feels like he did.",1095897600,2,1234,4.568181818181818
800768,5,6304119046,"This is the movie to end all movies.  Everything about it is just amazing.  Story, acting, cinematography, music.  It is sad, poignant, funny, dramatic, and hits every right note.

  Orson Welles, I must say is a cinematic genius.  The story begins with a newsreel about the death of Charles Foster Kane, newspaper giant, which begins to reveal the depth of Kane's character, and also his witticisms that help to define the way he lived his life.

  Kane is a man who was sold to the bank as a child when his mother came into money, and he was raised in preparation for being very rich. Very rich he is through his life, and he amasses a great fortune in building a 'pleasure palace' in Florida called Xanadu, and collects rare statues, and about anything there is to buy. He is married twice to a politician's daughter, and then to a beautiful singer.

  He himself runs for governor once, but loses, due to a scandal. All of this, by the way, is revealed in the opening sequence newsreel, so I am not spoiling the movie for anyone.  Anyway, Kane always sees himself as a spokesman for the people. And he wants people to love him, although he never truly can be a man of the people, because he is so gosh darn rich. At one point in the movie Kane says "" If I hadn't been very rich, I would have been a great man.""

  The dialogue in this film, is highly intelligent and telling, and always a pleasure to listen to.  Kane represents the fulfillment of the American dream, reaching the top, not merely by being raised with money, but by creating a name for himself with his ingenuity in running a newspaper.  His banker/ former guardian disapproves of his profession, but Kane carries on even if he's losing money, at first because he likes the fast pace and the public name he makes for himself.

  Kane always maintains a sort of boyish innocence despite all of the money and fame.  He is not a bad guy, just very stubborn, and sheltered in a way, from how to live a normal life.  He gets everything he wants, loses it, and loses something very dear to him, that is dear to everyone, that is revealed at the end of the film.  This loss is so sad, and so easy to relate to.

  This film, above all else, is highly intelligent, which is a feature that has become rare in the film world. The viewer is a participant in the unfolding story here, and is expected to be able to make connections to things they have seen earlier in the film.  Modern cinema, as a general rule, does not give the audience this much credit.  Here, Welles does, with Citizen Kane, and it is a real treat.

  Every scene is beautifully composed, and the lush black and white photography, and innovating stage setting, is breath-taking.  The music, as well, contributes to the story, including a song ""This can't be love,""  sung by a singer, when Kane and his wife go on a picnic.  Chilling scene, and my favorite in the movie.",1095292800,3,2899,4.413988657844991

800907,5,6304119046,"I won't waste space repeating what respected students of cinema, critics, and film fans have already said, and said much better than I can.  This is simply a remarkable movie--haunting, funny, sad, boisterous, bigger-than-life.  Whenever I watch the scenes of Welles portraying Kane as a young man, running the Enquirer, I get a lump in my throat:  so young and vibrant, totally unconcerned with the conventional wisdom about how movies should be made.  The twinkle in his eyes is his wink at the viewer; he's a magician (Welles literally was) letting you know that you're watching an illusion, and he's almost--but not quite--letting you in on the secret.  The secret, of course, is that all really good magic is mostly stagecraft and patter, and Citizen Kane is almost nothing but stagecraft and patter.  I think that's the secret of its ongoing appeal for me.  I like the fact that you can see some of the behind-the-scenes gizmos that make the trick work, and that it's still astonishing when you see the trick unfold.

The commentary by Roger Ebert for the 2-DVD set is terrific, by the way, despite a few small gaffs (e.g., Kane's friend is Jed Leland, not Jeb).  Don't deny yourself the pleasure of seeing Orson Welles and Gregg Toland, his photographer, pull out all the stops.",1092787200,,1285,4.831050228310502
800908,5,6304119046,"the negative reviews of ""citizen kane"" on this site seem to have one thing in common: whether the viewer fell asleep while watching, had to fast-forward to get to the end, or finished it but found it slow and boring, none of these reviewers seems to have returned for a second viewing.  and this is the crucial problem.

""citizen kane"" is a film that will require a second (or even a third) viewing.  why?  well, think about your favorite song for a moment.  do you remember the first time you heard it?  did you love it then the way you love it now?  if not, i suspect you grew to love it more and more over time as you became more familiar with its lyrics, its structure, its rhythms and its textures.  appreciating ""citizen kane,"" like appreciating great music (or, for that matter, great art of any kind) requires dedication and time.

there's a reason why the film is paced the way it is.  there's also a reason for the film's complex structure.  it's a portrait of a man's entire life, recounted by those who knew--or thought they knew--him best (notice that the narrative is never from kane's point of view).  and so it turns out to be a film not about charles foster kane himself, but rather about the way he is remembered by his friends and enemies.  and the final sequence, when you reach it, is truly heartbreaking.  the meaning of ""rosebud"" is revealed, but notice how that forces us to reevaluate all that has come before.  sure, we know what ""rosebud"" is, but we should ask ourselves what that means.  how well did all these people really know kane?  how well do we now know him?

there is so much to love here if you'll only give it a chance.  so, you've already seen the film once and now it's time for your second viewing.  brew yourself a strong cup of coffee, sit down and get comfortable, and start from the very beginning (no fast-forwarding this time).  if you find a shot that you like, pause it and look a little closer.  if you don't understand a scene, rewind and look at it again.  just as you would with a great part of a song, or with that word or two that you can't quite hear, allow yourself to linger over details and explore uncertainties.  this is how ""citizen kane"" will grab you and make you care.

and, well, if it still doesn't work for you, then come back and post another review.  i bet what you have to say the second time will be much more interesting than your initial lament.",1091836800,6,2419,4.379775280898876

My conclusion? This film is amazing. Honestly, I know very little about the movie making- I'm not in film class, I have never directed anything, and I don't even particularly enjoy behind-the-scenes documentaries; my qualifications lie far more in literature. As a result, I was interested more in the plot and characterizations in this film than I was in the manner in which it was filmed. It was my feeling that not only was this movie breathtaking in it's portrait of Kane, one of the most fascinating characters I have come across in movies or books, but the narrative structure was entrancing without being gimmicky- it jumped through time with as little pause as a Tarantino movie, gradually revealing backstory a la Memento without the inherent inhumanity of a movie about a person to whom virtually no audience member can relate.

Let's see, how about we give complete control of a major film to a twenty five year old radio voice with zero film experience (whose claim to fame was scaring the life out of the public with a fake story about aliens landing on earth) and even better, let him staff the movie with actors who have little to no screen experience. On top of that, we'll let it become one of the most controversial pictures of its time because it mirrors the life of one of the biggest names in America today. Why, it may never be able to be released because of the lawsuits-- Great idea!
I have just described Citizen Kane. All of the above is true, which makes the fact that it is possibly the greatest film in American Film History even more amazing. Everything is perfect. The script (which Welles co-wrote), the actors (all relative unknowns except Welles and Joseph Cotton), the special effects (listen to Roger Ebert's Commentary on this special edition for details) and finally, the makeup-- You won't believe how great a job they do making 25 year old Welles look 60.
As for the story, it's done in a most interesting fashion. Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dies at the very beginning of the movie and utters his famous last word ""Rosebud"". A reporter is given the task of finding out just what that one word meant. So he goes and interviews all the people who knew Kane to try to learn the meaning of the word. In the process, we are shown Kane through the eyes of those who knew him. We never see Kane through his own eyes, always what his former associates saw.
This is interesting, because Kane is a tragic figure as seen by just about everyone. He is unhappy and lonely. We as an audience eventually learn the meaning of Rosebud. I have read reviews that complain that the movie is about this one thing (I won't reveal what it is). But long before we learn the identity of Rosebud, the film has made its point. What is the point? My opinion is that the film shows us basically the worthlessness and despair of materialism. Loving ""stuff"" or money will ultimately lead to unhappiness.
By the way, this movie almost was never seen. The man I spoke of at the beginning of the review is William Randolph Hearst, former newspaper magnate. He saw too much of himself in the film and sued to squash it. Fortunately he lost. The second disc in the set is a two hour documentary on this topic. It is also excellent and well worth a viewing.
One last thing. Although this movie has been ranked on the AFI list as number one American movie of all time, it did NOT win Best Picture in 1941. That film? ""How Green was my Valley""",1089417600,4,2691,4.42741935483871

800913,5,6304119046,"So many of the films that critics unanimously pick as the greatest of all time are overrated, confusing, ponderous, overly symbolic art pieces that leave viewers scratching their heads. The collective reaction is, ""What in the hell was the director smoking?"" Arty camera work and tons of symbolism and metaphors can never take the place of good acting, solid direction and, most importantly, a good script.
Much has been made of Citizen Kane's technical brilliance -- Welles' use of overlapping conversations, Gregg Toland's deep focus photography, set design that incorporates ceilings, etc. However, none of this would really mean anything if the film didn't have a great story and screenplay. Citizen Kane may be a triumph in filmmaking technique, but it is also a deeply engrossing story with characters we can relate to and sympathize with. Welles' Kane is a selfish, unhappy, overly controlling dictator who has everything and yet still manages to make himself more and more unhappy. Most of us know the feeling of not appreciating someone or something good in our lives until he/she/it is gone. We see the promise and idealism in Kane's early life, like him and believe, as Joseph Cotten's Jed Leland does, that Kane is a great man who can do so much good in society. As Kane's life progresses, however, he becomes more and more bitter, alienates everyone who cares about him and dies alone, longing for the simplicity of his early life before he became wealthy. When Kane, as an old man, loses control when his second wife Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) leaves him, we can't help but feel for him -- even though most or all of his unhappiness is his fault. That the audience feels such empathy for such a flawed character is Citizen Kane's greatest triumph and is the true basis for Kane's reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.",1087948800,4,1855,4.8920634920634924

801024,5,6304119046,"Charles Foster Kane; welcome to Xanadu the biggest fortress ever built. That opening sequence in which we feel inmediatly the presence of the purest sense of the german expressionism, gives us one of the multiple clues who will give Orson Welles, this legend name in the cinema story.
Ths story is told brilliantly for Welles; the way Welles introduces to the world of Kane is through a new who informs us about the death. Warning about this point because Kane will never be telling his life in first person, but through all those knew him in a far or close distance. In this sense Welles, cleverly gives us a huige puzzle that you as viewers must arrange , and thanks to all his countless devices, at the end of the film when you finally discover what Rosebud means , you leave your seat convinced you're a private eye; but rememeber what Welles said once about Rosebud: it just was Freud for one dollar.
And this bitter opinion is due the fact that Rosebud means the iodea of something that never reached the complete process of growing up; a flower who never became the best of itself; I mean this point is remarkable because the sense of unfinishness is what Kane means ; nor more either less.
In fact Kane is a man who had everything he wanted; except just one thing; his stolen youth and the dreams contained in this unique stage of the life; the world needed just before he reached his twenty years old and made from him a man before the time comes.
That's why you can understand his outrageous character; and thanks to The Inquirer he can expand his biological time and in a certain way to try to live his lost years.
When he meets to Marian in that funny water accident; he confess her another clue; both of them are surrounded and involved by the loneliness even they are so distant in his respective social status.
And all his efforts walk in this direction. Remember by instance, the smart answer pronounced by Kane in a very special inflexion point of the story: ""I'm all what you hate"" .
Kane loves challenging the world, in every little detail; he plays with it and ""no matter if he losses one million dollars each year , because he would lose all his fortune in Sixty years"".
All his life turns around the sophistication, the greatness and above all to be remembered and loved or hated but never pass away by a sense of indifference. And this is an important issue, because there's a shakesperian mood in this point of view.
How can you translate the shakesperian spirit of glory and trascendence into a raising democatric country and also the new raisng empire of the world.
That impplies all his outrageousness; the expensive parties; the employement of the deepness of field which lets you watch the secondary planes just beside the first; remeber that dramatic sequence in which Welles and Cotten walk in the newspaper room.
The camera works at the floor level; another clever device of Welles; I think he wants to give us the sensation of being in a theatre hall , and in many ways that resource let add much more dramatism to every take.
Greg Tolland made an unfirgettable work behind the camera; because this film demands of you that the images through the travellings , dollies and objective use be another actor in this play.
The monumentality all along his achievements is obviously a consequence of his character; that justifies the fact of trying Marian be the greates prima voice female in the Opera ; (however; in the deep of his soul and his mind he knows she'll never reach that goal; but once more he's challenging the world)
Remember what Oscar Wilde said once:  ""The difference between a caprice and a passion who remains all the time of one life; is the caprice remains for a longer time"" .
This film will be always a must for all the viewers of any age and as well as Bach , Mozart or Beethoven music or the Michelangelo works or Vermeer paintings , due his mythical essence; such its own force for transforming every time you watch them; but the question is Who really transforms: you , the work of both of two?
Orson Welles (1915-1985) still continues being a refernce point for many film makers , great or minors ; and to name his contributions would surpass certainly the permitted limit of this review.
A film is really good, when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet, undoubtly a wise sentence of Orson Welles.
It's time for all those people who still hadn't watched this movie that literally is a must to make it.
A masterpiece in the widest sense of the word.",1085443200,2,4510,4.54054054054054
801025,4,6304119046,"Many of you, like me, may have had your Kane interest piqued by its ""#1 Film of All Time"" rating by the AFI (American Film Institute). Be forewarned that the AFI also honors ""Jaws"", ""Rocky"" and ""Snow White"" in the same breath. So whatever. If you dive into this film head first expecting the greatest thing to hit the screen, you will be disappointed.  The audio commentary itself (included on this edition) states that Welles' ""Chimes at Midnight"" is a superior film.
Personally, I thought Citizen Kane was very impressive. But I am easily impressed by camera lenses, lighting techniques and 1940s nostalgia. It isn't the acting, script or plot of Kane that appeals to me so much as its artistic storytelling.
If you read through these reviews, you'll be puzzled at how some people can proclaim it a work of art while others are bored and irritated by its pageantry. It's the same with a Picasso painting or a Beatles song or a Chicago skyscraper.  Art can be found in anything if you have the patience to look for it.

Yet the movie is poorly acted except for Orson Welles (Charles Foster Kane), and the plot isn't very intruiging either.

801028,5,6304119046,"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a motion picture is worth a million words. Unfortunately, Amazon limits reviews to a thousand words only so I'll have to be brief but no amount of words can do justice to ""Citizen Kane.""
I can't, and therefore won't, pretend to be ""objective"" about this film.  As the great Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci once said, ""Objectivity does not exist - it cannot exist ... The word is a hypocrisy which is sustained by the lie that the truth stays in the middle. No, sir: sometimes truth stays on one side only.""
In the case of ""Citizen Kane"" the truth is on one side only: it is a truly great film and deserves to be ranked as one of the greatest films, if not the greatest film, ever made. And anyone who says otherwise is not only wrong but grossly ignorant of this film, the history of film, and its place in the history of film.
A few key highlights on ""Citizen Kane.""
First, ""Citizen Kane"" is a work of art. (Yeah, I know that is a cliche, but like most cliches, it's true).  Most movies are merely entertaining because that is all they are meant to be and do. ""Citizen Kane"" tried to be more and do more and succeeded.
Second, Orson was a genius and ""Citizen Kane"" was his masterpiece.
Third, its screenplay is itself a masterpiece. Just as matter of fact, the actual shooting script was based on two scripts (written separately by Welles and Mankiewicz) that Welles combined into one for the final version. By the way, best screenplay was the only category that garnered an Academy Award for ""Citizen Kane.""  By rights, ""Citizen Kane"" should have won all the categories but did not because of the efforts of William Randolph Hearst (incredibly, the real Hearst was even worse than the man ""Citizen Kane"" portrayed!).
Third, the look (and sound) of ""Citizen Kane"" is glorious. Gregg Toland was one of the greatest cinematographers in the history of film, period, and ""Kane"" proves it. Without going into the boring (actually not boring) technical details, this film was ahead of its time and used many techniques for the first time that we have long since gotten used to. Unfortunately, we have forgotten where they came from.
Welles and his cinematographer Gregg Toland developed or enhanced techniques for allowing the drama to develop on multiple planes of vision and sound. the film's deep focus photography, which allows actors and objects to remain in focus whatever their distance from the camera, allowed multiple actions to be shown within a single frame and remain comprehensible, allowing for complex interactions between foreground and background.
Welles and John Aalberg created a complex soundtrack that merged multiple dialogues, sometimes spoken simultaneously, and music into a comprehensible whole.
Fourth, Bernard Herrmann. Do I need to say anything more? Although Bernard Herrmann received an Academy Award nomination for his score for ""Citizen Kane,"" he actually won the award that year for his music for ALL THAT MONEY CAN BUY.
Fifth, the film editing was fantastic. Kudos to Robert Wise.
Sixth, the extraordinary cast of actors were drawn entirely from the famed Mercury Theatre troupe, which Orson Welles founded when he was only 21 years old.
Seventh, It was directed by Orson Welles.
Eighth, It was produced by Orson Welles.
Ninth, Charles Foster Kane was portrayed by Orson Welles.
Tenth, ""Citizen Kane"" was made by Orson Welles. Did I mention that he shared the credit for best original screenplay?
I think there is a pattern here.
Bottom Line: If ""Citizen Kane"" is not already in your DVD collection, get the two-disc set, you won't regret it.",1083024000,3,3620,4.863857374392221
801029,5,6304119046,"I highly recommend this DVD edition of ""the greatest movie ever."" It has 2 great commentaries, one by director Peter Bogdonavich & the other by film critic Roger Ebert.
Also the DVD has the AMAZING 2 hour documantary, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane."" I basically spent an entire day watching citizen Kane: the movie twice (w/ and w/out Ebert's commentary) then the doc.
I think what makes this film the ""greatest movie"" is not only the film itself, but the history around it's release and the subject matter of the titular character and how the movie portrayed not only the real life media-mogul Kane was based on, William Randolph Hearst, but also the filmaker and star, Orson Welles.
The film was nominated for 9 Oscars but only won the best orig. screenplay. The short version of the story is:
Hearst was born a rich boy and became a SUPER rich boy w/ his newspaper empire in the early 1900s. Welles came to Hollywood from NYC after his famed WAR OF THE WORLDS radio broadcast in 1940. Welles was touted as a ""Genius"" by some papers and got ""the best studio deal in the history of Hollywood."" Him getting all this attention and creative control and not having made 1 film pissed off a lot of people. After Welles tried to get his 1st 2 films made and they fell through he started making CITIZEN KANE based on the life of Hearst.
It was leaked Welles was making the film and Hearst used his many papers to destroy the credability of Welles during the filming. His papers made up stories Welles was a Communist. This and Welles' own egomania (he believed the 'genius' title) & bad temper drove his reputation into the ground. CITIZEN KANE opened to limited release due to Hearst. After Heasrt died in 1950 the film started showing up on critics ""10 best films"" lists, eventually becoming the legend it is today. Welles never again got the kind of creative control or funding he got on KANE, his first and greatest film.",1082764800,2,1919,4.5813953488372094

801031,5,6304119046,"AFI recently rated its top 100 movies of all time. The list has some occasional questionable rankings, but nonetheless, gives credit where credit is due. Citizen Kane was ranked #1 on that list. Is it the best movie ever? In my opinion, not hardly. But it is a marvelous work of film and is certainly worth taking the time to watch.
The story is of the life of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. At a young age, Charlie Kane rises from poverty and takes control of a virtually unknown newspaper chain. In an attempt to become a citizen of the people, he strives to popularize himself with the public and provide more and better information than his lofty competitor. But in the end, Charlie Kane dies in his extravagant statue-laden palace of Xanadu, alone and unhappy.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie is that it avoids the traditional chronological timeline that many movies follow. Instead, it follows through a series of flashbacks among Kane's closest friends and acquaintances as they divulge their information and experiences of Kane to a reporter seeking to gain insight about the recently deceased and highly influential man. The timeline is frequently disrupted, a style of movie making that has become more and more popular in recent years, and the movie throws the viewer into a number of important periods of Kane's life as being told by the various people interviewed by the reporter. The reporter that seeks to learn more about Kane learns that his dying words were ""Rosebud"", but despite his frequent inquiries, he is unable to ascertain who exactly Rosebud is. Ultimately, the reporter never learns the true nature of Rosebud, but the viewer learns of the secret in the film's final scene as Kane's childhood sled is seen smoldering in a furnace, the word Rosebud painted on it. The question to the viewer then becomes: What is it about Rosebud that was so important to Kane in the end? It is, in my opinion, his nostalgia and longing for the days of innocence of his childhood. As a child, with no cares or worries in the world, Rosebud ultimately symbolized the happiness he felt at that period in his life, despite his impoverished state of living. As a dying man, he was unhappy, alone, and living in a state of perpetual despair, even with all of his luxuries and incredible wealth. And although the reporter never learns of the nature of Rosebud, he does in fact obtain his true goal of learning about the incredible life that was led by Charles Foster Kane.
The technical perfection and excellence that is associated with this movie is indeed profound. Camera angles, lighting, and other marvels of movie-making which I am not overly familiar with are still readily apparent to the amateur viewer. Focusing on the technical aspects of the film, one can surely appreciate the attention to detail that Welles put into making this extraordinary masterpiece and appreciate the aesthetic qualities that it exudes.
This movie was indeed way ahead of its time and is still thoroughly loved and marveled at by movie lovers to this very day.

  The movie's plot is a different story. Charles Foster Kane is based on the real life man William Randolph Hearst, who was a newspaper tycoon during the late 19th century to the mid 20th century.

When we tried to see it, we nearly fell asleep, so we just kinda fast forwarded to the end.

The theme veers around a (typical) rich guy who was born with a silver spoon, then gagged on it with his egotistical empire of yellow journalism, and made a spectacular, stylish mess of his life. The plot line is thus simple and predictable, the acting very convincing but not legendary. There are several quotable quotes, which may interest some viewers. Around the middle the movie exhibits a bit of chaff, long scenes where very little purposeful happens.
Yet, the artistic value along with some of the ""scandal"" involved in Citizen Kane (semblance to the real life of William Hearst) is what made it a classic years later. If it is believed that this film was a trailblazer in cinematography, I can absolutely see why. It sports a dazzling kaleidescope of amazing lighting tricks and innovative camera angles (e.g., having the camera on the floor).

This 2 DVD set contains the #1 rated American movie of all time in resored digital transfer with multiple commentary tracks; more importantly, it also contains a narrative documentary that traces the fast-paced life of the young Orson Welles whose career would be dashed over this film.
The documentary's thesis - that Kane is essentially an autobiography of Welles superimposed on the canvas of publisher W.R. Hearst's life is a cogent argument and one of the most facinating stories in 20th century America.
Both men were willing to sacrifice the truth for spectacle, and both succeeded in radically transforming the world around them. Hearst changed newspapering in America. In the early days he'd pay any price to get the best reporters and editors and turn them against the rich and powerful. Welles equally changed the world of electronic media, showing the world the terror that radio could bring with 'The War of the Worlds' and the political muscle Hollywood could weild with 'Kane.'
It might seem that Welles got the last laugh in this showdown. But the documentary is wise to point out that the movie's legacy is the only enduring winner. Movie lovers around the world also win - as 'Kane' is one of the most entertaining and dramatic yarns in cinema history.
The audio commentary tracks by Roger Ebert and Welles biographer Peter Bogdanovich are chock full of cinematic insights and interesting anecdotes.

While it is true that some lighting techniques that are employed are dated and worn, you wouldn't have to go far (for instance the blockbuster Harry Potter films) to see that these techniques are still used OVER SIXTY YEARS LATER.  The cast (especially Orson Welles) brilliantly portray very realistic feeling characters.  The camera was used to enhance the story's changing moods and directions, but Orson Welles never gets caught up on making the picture so spectacular as to overshadow the plot.  Through each and every scene the story becomes more involving, building a suspense that climaxes with the final shot.
This is the way movies should be done.  So many movies in the past half century have tried to imitate the simple brilliance of Citizen Kane but have fallen short.",1063065600,5,844,4.915492957746479

Clearly, hundreds of movies to follow were influenced by the new and daring strategies used by Wells; this special edition includes commentary from Hollywood insiders describing the exact extent of the impact the movie has made.  That being said, however, what was once groundbreaking has lost some of its mystique given that so many modern films have surpassed the techniques used here--should Memento be considered one of the best movies of all time too?  Yes, the story is engaging, the mystery intriguing, and the character of Charles Foster Kane compelling; combined with the filming methods, these characteristics truly make Citzen Kane a great movie.

801285,5,6304119046,"There's not much to say about ""Citizen Kane"" that hasn't already been said.  I know there are people who don't understand why this film is considered to be one of the most brilliantly made films ever produced, but I propose the reason for that is this: the film and narrative techniques on display in ""Kane"" have become so integral to every film made since that they no longer seem special in Orson Welles' film when looked at from a 21st Century perspective.  I encourage anyone still in doubt of this film's greatness to instead look at it from an historical perspective; just compare it to any other movie that also came out in 1941 and I think ""Kane""'s uniqueness will be apparent.
I don't think the film is without flaws.  Welles' pacing can be slow at times, and I think the last quarter of the movie especially drags.  The story itself isn't particularly interesting or even novel for its time, but one doesn't (or shouldn't) watch ""Kane"" for the originality of the story.  Instead, pay attention to how the story is told and who's telling it.  When the film is over, ask yourself this: can you say you've been given an objective account of Kane's story?  Do you really know what happened to him?
This is radical stuff for 1941. Can you imagine a movie being released at that time that didn't answer the questions it raised?  The motivation that puts the entire world of the film in motion remains unresolved.  That doesn't happen very often in films even now, let alone then.
And if none of this is reason enough to watch ""Citizen Kane,"" just watch it for the stunning cinematography and compositions.  Virtually every frame is a work of art in itself.
And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, then just watch it for Orson Welles' mesmerizing performance in the title role.  Easily one of the ten best in cinema history.
And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, you're on your own.",1061164800,3,1897,4.5828402366863905
801408,5,6304119046,"Whether or not the AFI was right in calling Citizen Kane ""The best movie of all time"" is debatable, but it still stands as one of those essential movies that everyone has to see. Orson Welles, then young and precocious, displayed style and intelligence in Citizen Kane that revolutionized filmmaking, and the film might be considered groundbreaking more for it's technical accomplishments than the movie itself.
Welles directs himself as Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon whose life was often the biggest source of news around. ""Loved by millions, hated by just as many"" was his catchphrase. The movie follows his entire life, from childhood to death. It was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, a real-life newspaper tycoon. I have seen Citizen Kane so many times, and it is starting to feel dates, especially in the dialogue. But the performances from Welles and his Mercury Theatre group and the visual elements more than make up for that. As the documentary and commentary teach us (more on that in a minute), Citizen Kane was more of a techical accomplishment. Welles used camera tricks, montage techniques, and difficult shots that were, at the time, never before seen on the screen. The attention to detail that went into every scene illustrates the passion that Welles brought to the screen. It has rarely been matched by any movie made since.
For the 60th Anniversary, Warner has put together a terrific 2 DVD set. The obvious jewel in the crown is the 2 hours documentary titled ""The Battle over Citizen Kane"", which not only tells the story of how the movie was made, but the lives of both Welles and Hearst. It is essential viewing to say the least. My second favorite extra is the Audio Commentary by film critic Roger Ebert. Love him or hate him, you can't deny his passion for movies and his almost encyclopedic knowledge of the subject. His commentary is full of fun facts and insight that made me look at Citizen Kane differently. The second commentary is by Peter Bogdanovich, a film scholar and Welles biographer. This one has it's moments, but it meanders at times. The Ebert one is the best. Rounding off the extras is an entertaining theatrical trailer and loads of storyboards, photos, and promos.
Citizen Kane will always be regarded as a masterpiece, and rightly so. This DVD set from Warner is a must have, and with the quality of the extras, expect to be spending a lot of time with this DVD. Essential.",1061164800,2,2453,4.801418439716312

Movie Review
Citizen Kane was filmed in 1941 and was directed by, produced by, and starred Orson Wells.  Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Wells wrote the screenplay.  In the opening scene there was a lot of symbolism such as wrought iron fences, fog, a moat, a light on the hill from the house and the light going out when the main character of the film died.  It was during this scene Charles Foster Kane, the main character, speaks the word ""Rosebud"" and then drops a glass globe that shatters on the floor.  Just before it shatters, the viewer looks inside at the falling snow and then Kane dies.  The story is based on the true story about William Hearst, newspaper tycoon.
I give this movie 5 stars because from start to finish this movie keeps you intrigued with one thought and that is, ""What is Rosebud.""  Orson Wells never overworked any scene as so many movies do nowadays.  The movie was filmed with a lot of symbolism which keeps the movie viewer's interest and also feeds the viewer's thoughts well beyond the length of the movie.
The movie takes you back to the time just before Charles Foster Kane became one of the world's richest people in history.  Charles Kane's story began when a boarder could not pay for his rent at a boarding home owned by Mr. & Mrs. Kane.  The boarder gave Mary Kane a deed to an old abandoned mine for payment. The mine was later called the Colorado Lode Gold Mine and the 3rd richest gold mine known in the world.  Mary Kane took $50,000 of that fortune for her and her husband.  She then gave custody of her son, Charles Foster Kane, to Mr. Thatcher, a banker from New York, who would manage the fortune and boy until he was 25 years old.
Kane bought the New York Inquirer and immediately became publisher and printed news by ""his definition.""  Some called Kane a ""yellow journalist.  Mr. Jedediah Leland, a schoolmate, ""best buddy"" and dramatic critic for the Inquirer stated, ""I was his oldest friend,"" and Mr. Kane ""never gave anything away,"" ""newspaper was his life...and he loved himself,"" but Kane ""didn't know how to love anyone.""

After Kane's death the big question on everyone's mind was ""who or what was Rosebud.""  A newspaper reporter interviewed Kane's 2nd wife, Kane's General Manager, and even his butler-in-charge at his well known estate, Xanadu, but no one knew what the significance of Rosebud was.
Charles Kane loved to collect beautiful things and among those collections were statues, paintings, and pictures that could have filled 10 museums.  Kane's collection was worth billions.  Charles Foster Kane had the 6th largest private fortune in the world.  Even though he could buy anything that he ever wanted, Kane was never able to buy love and happiness, consequently Charles Kane died alone.
During the liquidation of Kane's estate the packers and movers were told to burn items that had no significant worth.  The camera zooms in to see a man throwing a boy's sled into the furnace that had Rosebud painted on it.  The sled was the only possession left of Kane's boyhood and memories when he went sledding in the snow.  Most importantly though, the sled symbolized the time in Charles's life when he had a mother and father and a home and when he was loved.",1060214400,,3239,4.677248677248677
801410,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane is one of the most analyzed and written about films in all the history of movies.  You certainly don't need any commentary from me about the artistic merits of the film.  However, I will say that I find the movie visually stunning with a visual style that has been copied by many and almost always to lesser effect.  Some of the images stay in my memory like a beautiful melody.
The script is also very good and at times it is powerful.  And while it is always listed as one of the greatest of all movies, and maybe as a movie it is, I certainly don't think it is the most powerful or moving film ever made.  It certainly is a great film, but can't you think of others that move you more deeply that were also well made films?
But to think that Welles was only 25 years old when he made this film is absolutely breathtaking.  In making this film, Welles at once triumphs as a producer, director, and actor.  I can't even think of a similar achievement to compare it with.  Wagner at Bayreuth?
This disk is a very beautiful transfer of the film (there are a few small defects), plus interesting commentaries by Roger Ebert, and Peter Bogdanovich, plus the trailer, newsreel from the premier, storyboards, and a second disk with a two-hour documentary on the battle Welles had with Hearst over the making and release of the film.  Isn't it interesting that the film has become more famous than Hearst?  Such a thing was unimaginable in 1941.
But don't buy into the myth that this is a crypto biography of Hearst.  There is also McCormick and others (McCormick is the one who built the opera house for his mistress).  Certainly, aspects of Hearst's excesses are obvious, but one of the powers of fiction in the hands of an artist is to mix multiple realities together to get at something deeper and more instructive.  Ebert points out that the famous scene in which Kane destroys his mistress's room was based on a scene where Welles himself lost his temper in a restaurant.  True artists spare themselves least of all.
This is a great set of disks that do justice to this great film.  I am glad that I own it.  It deserves to be in your collection.",1059436800,4,2159,4.455470737913486
801411,5,6304119046,"How much power can a man have? How much power can a man wish? How much would a man influence others, and how much would he wish to control them?
This is an excellent movie to think about these questions. It may seem too fictitious judging just by the questions, but *there are* people like that outside. There are people with such power, and people with such ambition, or desire of controlling others.
And, at the end of their lives, if they grew up that much power, they could still influence others in bizarre ways, as the movie shows from its start.
This movie gives space not only for these thoughts, but also for the other side of human relationship. Not control, but affection. How do humans choose one or another to pursue?",1059091200,,730,4.496240601503759

Mary Kane, Charles's mother, ran a boarding home and by default a boarder gave her a deed to an old abandoned mine, which later was called the Colorado Lode Gold Mine, the 3rd richest gold mine in the world.  Mr. Thatcher, a banker from New York, took charge of Charles, who was just a boy, after Mary Kane gave up custody.
Kane was seventy years old when he died.  Kane married and divorced twice.  Kane's first wife was the current President's niece and her name was Emily Monroe Norton.  Charles Kane married his 2nd wife, Susan Alexander, two weeks after his first divorce.
A newspaper reporter, Mr. Thompson, interviewed people that knew Charles Kane to find out what ""Rosebud"" meant.  Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Kane's General Manager, said that ""Emily was no rosebud"" and maybe ""Rosebud may have been something that he lost.""  Neither, Mr. Bernstein or Susan Alexander knew what ""Rosebud"" meant.  Susan ""didn't want to sing"" and ""everything was his idea, even my leaving him.""
As publisher of the New York Inquirer, Mr. Kane would print news by ""his definition,"" and some called Kane a ""yellow journalist.  Mr. Jedediah Leland, a schoolmate, ""best buddy"" and dramatic critic for the Inquirer stated during his interview, ""I was his oldest friend,"" and Mr. Kane ""never gave anything away,"" ""newspaper was his life...and he loved himself,"" but ""Rosebud, I don't know.""  Mr. Leland wrote the dramatic critique about Susan's poorly performed opera debut and was later fired.
Kane was still married to his first wife when Charles and Susan's affair was publicized at the same time Kane was running for Governor of New York.  Kane lost the election.  The Inquirer printed that there was a ""Fraud at the Polls,"" twisting the truth as was the usual.
  The butler-in-charge told Mr. Thompson that when Susan left, Charles trashed Susan's bedroom and that Mr. Kane ""was a man who had everything"" and that ""I guess Rosebud was just a piece of the puzzle that was missing.""
Charles Kane was a collector of statues, paintings, and pictures that could have filled 10 museums and was worth billions.  Charles Foster Kane had the 6th largest private fortune in the world.
The last scene of this movie was seen in the boiler room with a staff member burning some of the items considered to be worthless and the camera zooms in to show the viewers that a sled that belonged to Charles when he was a child and still living with his parents was being burned up and bore the brand name Rosebud.",1059004800,,3135,4.719266055045871

Orson Welles was a genius and not only that, had the balls to take on Hearst in a passive aggressive fest that could do nothing but provoke anger from the publishing magnet. Visualy stunning and intense, this movie should be in every dvd library.

It has been 62 years since its release and yet it remains one of the most interesting, indeed compelling films ever made. It was directed by Orson Welles who also plays the lead role of Charles Foster Kane. William Randolph Hearst presumably served as the model for Kane. (I have no interest in getting into all that now. Others have already discussed quite thoroughly the film's historical context and have much of value to say about it. The comments which follow are limited entirely to the film itself.) Perhaps only directors and cinematographers can fully appreciate Welles' technical achievements in this film. Even 62 years later, I am still fascinated by the analysis of Kane personality, especially as it is revealed in his relationships with various associates over several decades. His intelligence is formidable, his charm almost irresistible and yet....

Most of us have an indelible childhood memory or association. For Kane, it is ""Rosebud,"" the last word he spoke before dying. Those who view this film accompany reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) as he seeks to understand the meaning of Kane's last word. We learn that  Kane  was relinquished as a child by his parents (Agnes Moorehead and Harry Shannon) after he becomes the heir to a substantial fortune; his conflicts with his guardian, Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris); his impetuous decision to run a newspaper with the help of schoolmate Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane) because it would be ""fun""; his emergence from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton (Ruth Warrick), whose uncle is the President of the United States; then Kane's bid for public office which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore); Kane's futile attempts to promote his second wife as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive but incomplete palace called ""Xanadu.""

Thompson conscientiously attempts to reconstruct Kane's life as best he can but even so, there are so many unanswered questions as the film ends. What does Kane make of his childhood? When was he happiest? Why embarrass and abandon Emily, a decent and devoted wife? Why did he decide to spend what remained of his life with Susan Alexander? As he lay dying, did he feel that his life (everything considered) was a success? I have thought about these and other questions a great deal and am dissatisfied with my responses to them. No doubt that explains why this film continues to attract and then frustrate me...and perhaps others. There are other questions which I would have asked of Welles, especially during his final years.

Perhaps (just perhaps) the answers to all of the questions which could be asked of Kane and of the man who created and then portrayed him cannot be answered. And perhaps (just perhaps) that is why this film continues to attract and then frustrate efforts such as mine and others to explain it. So I guess we must cherish its art and accept its ambiguities, just as ultimately we must accept the basic ambiguity of what it means to be a complicated human being.",1057622400,8,3575,5.062818336162988

Great characterizations, unconventional (for its time) structure, beautiful and effective photography by Gregg Toland and stunning performances that make this film what it is.  So rarely do the full complement of elements in a production work this well together.
The real treat of this DVD, of course, is the fact that not only is there the film itself, but also a fantastic documentary on Welles and William Randolph Hearst (the inspiration for the character of Kane).  It's an episode of the PBS series 'The American Experience' and it reveals a great deal about the circumstances leading up to the production of the film (as well as a detailed recounting of the conflict between Hearst and the Welles camp before and after the film's release).",1056931200,4,831,5.0

801521,4,6304119046,"In the movie Citizen Kane, auteur Orson Welles uses a variety of visual effects to make his film appealing to audiences. The film begins in medias res because Kane has already died at the start of the film. This technique is used to immediately capture the attention of the audience. The film is about a group of reporters who set out to research the life of the very rich, static character Charles Kane. Their goal was to discover the meaning behind his last words, ""Rosebud."" The audience learns about the life of Kane through the use of flashbacks and a nonlinear film structure. As the reporters interview different people in Kane's life, we are taken back in time to witness the relationship Kane had with those people. This style of film is much more interesting than the normal chronological structure.
The flashback to Kane's childhood shows a happy boy playing in the snow on his sled. His mother is inside making arrangements to send him away after learning Charles would be inheriting a large sum of money. The extreme close up angle of her face shows that she believes she is doing this for the good of her son. She obviously feels he would be better off away from his father, especially with all of the money he will receive. This flashback explains why later in life Kane's character is so concerned with earning the love and acceptance of others. He felt like his mother sent him away because he wasn't good enough. He spends his adult life trying to force people to love him. He marries two different women, runs for governor, and buys a few newspapers in an attempt to control what people think. Unfortunately, nothing works out as Kane would have liked, and he dies a very lonely man. In order for a film to be successful, the audience must have a connection with the main character. The flashback to Kane's childhood makes the audience feel sorry for him and understand why he is the man he is.
The direction style in this film was way ahead of its time. Fading scenes made smooth transitions, even with the nonlinear structure in which it is filmed. Filming in black and white allowed Welles to take advantage of shadows. When Susan tries to convince Kane that she does not want to sing anymore, he steps towards her and his shadow covers her face as he tells her she cannot quit. She is singing again in the next scene. The camera angles are high as Kane gives his speech during the run for governor to indict that power and presence Kane exhibits. When Susan leaves Kane, there is a close up of a bird squawking loudly, which shows the emotional turmoil Kane is suffering through as he becomes alone once again.
There is a lot of symbolism in Citizen Kane. The most important symbol is the sled called Rosebud, which represents the only time Kane was ever truly happy in his life. This symbolism technique is called value placed on an object by a character. The reporters in the film fail to uncover the meaning of Rosebud, and in the denouement it is ironically burned as junk. The snow globe also represents his happy early childhood. The palace he builds represents Kane's wealth and power, yet all the space inside represents how lonely he really is inside.
Kane's character remains static throughout the movie. Even when he realizes he is losing those close to him, he refuses to change his ways. He loses two wives and his best friend and is left to die alone and miserable. Susan's character is very innocent and nave when she first meets Kane. After many years in an unhappy marriage, she develops the nerve to leave Kane.
The unique style of directing and great acting makes Citizen Kane a fantastic movie.",1055980800,6,3637,4.622874806800618

There's very little action in this movie, just a lot of talk, talk, talk about Kane. There's sort of a plot, which is about finding out what ""Rosebud"" means.

The PBS documentary on the battle over the film, between Welles and William Randolph Hearst, is fascinating entertainment in its own right.  A wonderful and truly interesting documentary.  Pairing it with the definitive copy of the film, at minimal cost to consumers, is a great idea.
The audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich is reasonably interesting, and the audio commentary by Roger Ebert is especially deep and enjoyable.
For those who don't know, the movie itself is brilliant.  It exemplifies every element of what can make a film great : psychological depth, skillfully constructed screenplay, real human emotion and depth, great characters, great acting, great cinematography, real level of quality and ambition.  This DVD presents it in all its glory as well as supplemental materials that will please any fan and will give anyone new to the film much background as to why this film is frequently listed as the greatest of all time.",1048723200,5,1113,5.021739130434782

  The story if about Charles Foster Cane (Wells) a newspaper tycoon. I will not say more becouse you should see it for yourself. Do yourself a favor and get the DVD with the commintary by Roger Ebert. It gives real insight to this already amazing film....",1047600000,,558,4.355769230769231
801619,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane is rightfully regarded as one of the great films in the history of the cinema, if not the greatest.  Orson Welles, the boy wonder of the New York stage, made the greatest screen debut ever in directing and starring in this amazing film.  Although some critics have tried to minimize Welless contribution to the film by pointing out that the movie as filmed by Welles was enormously faithful to the brilliant original screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz.  No doubt the original script played a major role in the success of the film, though it should also be pointed out that the film was graced by major talents at every point.  The score was by Bernard Hermann, considered by many to be the greatest composer for cinema (Pyscho, North by Northwest,  and Taxi Driver were just three of his other films), while cinematographer Gregg Toland even before Citizen Kane had already established himself as one of the masters of his discipline, and Robert Wise was a celebrated editor before embarking on a highly successful career as a director.  But despite all the talent, Welles managed to outshine them all, and make his mark on this film as few individuals ever have.  Although utterly inexperienced in cinema, Welles managed one visually brilliant moment after another.  Having a cinematographer of the quality of Toland helped enormously, in that he could help Welles translate his vision into film.  The scene where adults decide the future of a young Kane whose playing in the snow is framed by a window in the background is a brilliant but impossible shot, but it packs a visual wallop.  Or the scene in which Kane and other characters are filmed from below ground level, with the camera being place in a hole in the floor shows that even in his first film Welles was trying to go beyond his predecessors.
Welles was not the only cinematic neophyte working on the film.  Many of the key performers in the cast had not worked in film before, but had been members of Welless Mercury Theater.  The cast is impeccable, and because so many went on to long careers in cinema and TV it is hard to remember that at the time they were virtually all unknowns.
Yet, despite all its greatness, Citizen Kane is in the end an emotionally unengaging film.  The viewer never gets close to Charles Foster Kane, and while our hearts go out to the little boy who is separated from his Rosebud, they don't linger with him.  Not just Kane, but all of the characters feel remote from the viewer.  Kane strikes us, in the end, more as victimizer than victim, and one feels that whatever bad things have happened to him were more a result of his actions than anything that was done to him.  In the end, I find Citizen Kane easier to admire and respect than to love and cherish.  The greatest film of all time?  Possibly.  The most moving?  By no means.
My favorite moment in the film contains perhaps my favorite line in all cinema.  Mr. Bernstein, played by Everett Sloane, is reminded by a reporter that in the early days of Kanes career they made a lot of money, to which he replies, Yes, we made a lot of money.  But theres no trick to making a lot of money, if all you want to do it make a lot of money.",1047513600,4,3198,4.544502617801047
801620,5,6304119046,"Every time this movie is rerun on Television, I stop the remote and see it over again to pick out some of the incredible and innovative visuals and details Wells made.

801621,5,6304119046,"I thought I'd just contribute my two cents in the ongoing Citizen Kane controversy. Having seen the film a couple of times, I understand why it recieves such accolades. I also understand why it recieves negative reviews. I will be counted among those who believe Citizen Kane to be a truly great film. Even beyond its ""Greatest-American-Movie"" status, it's a remarkable viewing experience. On my first viewing, several years ago, indeed, I had trouble staying awake. However, I watched it again last year, and I was completely engrossed until the very last frame. I loved it. Every bit of it, from the story to the acting to the photography.
However, its easy to understand why other such movies as Casablanca and Gone With The Wind are bigger crowd pleasers while Citizen Kane is pretty much revered solely among film buffs and critics. Those two movies are closer to the typical Hollywood formula. While they don't exactly have happy endings, romance is a big part of their storylines. Citizen Kane is not a romance. It's more about the man himself than his relationship with his wife. Those films also contain more obvious, straightforward narratives than Citizen Kane. Kane is more like a montage than a narrative. Most people seem to prefer a conventional narrative in movies. That could be two reasons why Citizen Kane isn't more highly regarded among the casual moviegoer.
I will say this also. The people who make the claim that Citizen Kane is the greatest American movie are people who are generally a lot more familiar with the overall scope of American film than I or most of the reviewers here. They are film scholars, not just casual movie viewers. People who see Citizen Kane in its historical context and not just as an old movie. People who see Citizen Kane in relation to the grand scope of film history. I cannot make the claim that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie of all time. For one thing, I have not seen every movie ever made and I'm not familiar enough with the world of cinema (especially the early half of the 20th century) to even begin to make that claim. However, the people that do make this claim are people that truly know the world of film and study every aspect of it. I'm not saying that you should agree just because movie scholars say so, but I'm saying that those who make this claim generally know a lot more about movies than the rest of us.
I wouldn't even begin to know what movie to deify as the greatest of all time. I don't know enough about cinema history to even think of making such a claim about any movie. However, if Citizen Kane is not the greatest, then it certainly belongs at least in the Top 10.",1047081600,,2655,4.61522198731501

801623,5,6304119046,"It's no secret and no wonder why Citizen Kane continues to captivate audiences 50 years after its initial release.  By now everyone knows of, or has heard about, the epic battle to have the film boycotted and destroyed.  William Randolph Hearst was not a happy camper when this fictionalized bio, that strangely paralleled his own life, hit the big screen. But there was little he could do to stop audiences from taking to it like moths to a flame.  Welles directed, produced and stars as Charles Foster Kane, a man so encapsulated in his own wanton revelries that he gradually collapses under the weight of his own debauchery.
Warner Home Video has at last given this American classic a stunning digital transfer.  The film elements rarely show signs of their age.  Contrast and shadow delineation is remarkable.  The audio has also been nicely restored.

The print, as other reviewers have noted, is remarkably crisp and clear -- this release is comparable to some of the better Criterion releases.  Also, I found the commentaries to be quite interesting.  Robert Ebert's commentary was as good as any I have seen, to my considerable surprise.  The included documentary is also quite good.  The other special features were well-executed if somewhat superfluous.

801625,5,6304119046,"""Citizen Kane"" tells an old story, but what it has to say is as relevant as ever. Everyone knows the basics--Charles Foster Kane is a newspaper publisher who, after his death, is remembered by those close to him. (""Close"" is really the wrong word, as Kane managed to alienate pretty much everyone he knew.) What becomes clear is that nobody really knew Kane; he kept himself removed from the world as he accumulated possessions. The reporters covering his death feel that, if they can identify the meaning of his last word, Rosebud, they will gain some insight into his mind. This is really only a plot device, though. Nothing can fully explain Kane, or any of us.
This movie has been so lauded for its technical achievement, the camera angles, etc., that it is easy to overlook the screenplay (by Herman Mankiewicz and Orson Welles) and, especially, the acting. That Welles, at 25, could have portrayed an elderly man so well is astounding. One wants to give credit to the makeup, but it's more than that. We feel that Welles has really lived all those bygone years. Of course the supporting cast members, most of whom had never acted in film, are also excellent.
Roger Ebert's commentary on the DVD is really outstanding, and particularly good at pointing out specific shots and camera tricks. There is also a track by Peter Bogdanavich. A documentary, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"", explores the parallels among Welles, William Randolph Hearst, and the figure of Kane. It is quite well made, and they certainly got a lot of people to talk. But after seeing both Bogdanavich and Ebert explain that many parts of Kane were based not on Hearst, but on other figures, the documentary seems too intent on showing Kane to be an exact double for Hearst.
The reason for my title is that, when something has been called ""the greatest film,"" people want to approach it with an oppositional attitude. ""Oh yeah? We'll just see about that!"" It is better to simply expect a good movie. Noting its influence on later films increases one's admiration. But it is not necessary--""Citizen Kane"" does just fine by itself.",1045267200,2,2105,4.785714285714286
801626,5,6304119046,"This is the greatest American film ever made, as entertaining as it is revolutionary.
When it was made, Orson Welles tackled a seemingly simple topic, a reflection back on a dead man's search for love and happiness in his life, and made a film that's epic in scope, gorgeous in its visual execution, brilliantly written, incredibly acted.
All in all, it's inspiring to filmmakers looking for a great debut film from a new director. ""Citizen Kane"" also works for regular moviegoers just looking for a good drama.
Using interviews with all his closest friends and colleagues, Welles uses flashback to create a portrait of the life of millionaire media magnate Charles Foster Kane. Kane was, in conflicting accounts of those who knew him, a man of great character and potential or a wealthy, cold, manipulative scoundrel.
What, if anything, can be learned about the man from his last word? What does ""Rosebud"" mean?
The answer makes for good mystery, and it leads the viewer to ask key questions about what defines our lives and gives them meaning.

I do admit that sometimes I was bored with the plot, but what I really paid attention to was the impressive cinematography. I was most impressed with the deep-focus camerawork and the extreme foreground and background vision. While some may be unimpressed, it's important to realize that this film was made in the 1940's and many of the techniques used in this film were unheard of at the time. It was a pioneer for future filmmaking and cinematography. In addition, the magnificent acting allowed for many long, uninterrupted shots. The acting is so good (particularly Welles'), you'd never know that almost every castmember had no film experience prior to this movie. The bonus DVD profiles the battle between William Randolph Hearst and RKO over the release of this film. The informative documentary provides some insight to why Hearst vehemently opposed this movie.

801692,5,6304119046,"I think that this is probably one of the greatest movies of all time. The scope and vision that it took to make such a movie as this is amazing to me, to say the very, very least. If you are a serious film student, or interested in the history of American film, then this is a must see for you.
Those who contend that this film is nothing more than self glorification of hollywood and it's many characters have either a) missed the point or b)failed to appreciate it.
In the former case, I think that the individuals who criticize it without understanding it are looking at it through modern day spectacle eyes, trying to see it as something that is supposed to be entertaining and have a point. The 'point' is simply that our own lives seem so complicated and big, but break down to a few moments that we hang on to forever, maybe without anyone else even knowing. That is what life is. Other movies try to glorify life or make it something that it is not...why do you think they have the line 'I always wanted to say this...', it's because in real life you can't...real life is dishes and bills. That what citizen kane struck me as, dishes and bills. Truth.
The later group is the noveau cliche type, those who think that art is some underground thing that only they and a few others know about. Bad news for you folks is this: there were a lot more renaisance painters than leonardo, but he survived because so many liked and appreciated his works. Others claimed that there were other artists who had a better scope or understood 'art for art' better than that master...question is, where are they now? If your vision of art is so much better than the masses, then why isn't it in the masses? That is my answer to those reviewers look at this movie; that this (movie) is the type of art that reflects the culture it came from, that will survive as a reflection of that culture. There are hundreds of others, true, but they failed on the simple basis of broad blanketing of social capture. My personal favorite is Pygmalion, but I'm no fool to think it will be shown in history classes years from now as explanation of our times.

What's even more astounding is realizing that Welles was 25 when he made this!  How someone could convey so many tacit aspects of a larger than life character and keep him real without making him a cartoonish buffoon is an amazing feat when you think of the life experience you need to live for the kind of perspective necessary to avoid a very easy pitfall such as that.

It has top numerous lists (including AFI's Top 100 American Films) and is revered by practically every movie critic.  While some film has to rank number one, and Citizen Kane deserves the title as much as any film, actually watching the film is a bit of a letdown.  That is not to deny the film's greatness.  Orson Welles directed, co-wrote and stars in the film and he set the standard for the likes of Woody Allen and Spike Lee to command the three major components of a movie.  No one else reached the levels of greatness that Mr. Welles reached with Kane.  His acting is brilliant, the screenplay is sharp and his directing is first rate.  The fact that he only won an Oscar for the screenplay and the film was a commercial bomb shows that the Academy and film going public weren't ready to accept this progressive film and how he was ahead of his time.  The actors in the film were apart of Mr. Welles' Mercury Players and they all (especially Joseph Cotton) give strong turns.  Going back to my point about the film being a bit of a letdown, I mean with all the praise and superlatives that are heaped on the Citizen Kane, the film has set such an impossible buildup, it may not meet the modern film fan's expectations.  The bonus disk is worthy of a separate release itself.  It contains the documentary, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which itself was nominated for an Oscar, that is one of the better documentaries about Hollywood that has been produced.

The documentary is the story of what happened when William Randolph Hearst found out about the film and thought it was about him.
In terms of the film, it's done beautifully. Wonderfully edited and rarely shot at a right angel, it's done with wonderfull precision. All the actors are well cast for their roles and Orson Welles himself assumes not mearly the title role, he literally becomes him.

This review is for those of you who do not know about this film, and are maybe even wondering why you should care. Why do so many film critics lavish so much praise on a film made so long ago?
One reason is the director and star of the film, Orson Welles. Already considered to be a genius at a young age, Welles stormed Hollywood at age 25 with the clout of a man three times his age. With that power, he made a movie that defied typical storytelling techniques, invented cinematic tricks on the fly, and successfully pulled off filming an unflattering, near bio-pic of the nation's most powerful newspaper publisher, William Randolph Hearst.
The kind of ""carte-blanche"" given to Orson Welles at the time, was unprecedented, but now, it's unthinkable. That makes this film all the more mezmerizing because it's a fantastic film.
It centers around Charles Foster Kane, a larger-than-life man without the fear that stops lesser men from achieving greatness. But Kane's life is not all great, and in a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards, we see how Charles Foster Kane was both tender and loving, but ruthless and selfish just the same.
This is a film of immense importance in American cinema. It was Orson Welles' greatest acheivement, yet the beginning of his downfall. After all, who could possibly top a movie as good as ""Citizen Kane?"" Welles discovered that it was impossible to even try.
This is an important film for fans of movies, film historians, people interested in the William Randolph Hearst connection, and in the sheer drama of filmmaking. There has never been a movie like it, and there never will be. It is a film that will surprise you, no matter how many times you watch it.

  I had a little disapointing experience when I saw this movie for the first time. I just guess what ROSEBUD means before the movie's end. There was a episode of a cartoon in the 80's that use a piece of idea of Citizen Kane in the history. It was about a ghost of a millionaire that always shout Roooussebuuuddd around the old mansion, large like a castle. In the end of the episode this ghost is seen happily enjoying his skiing board in the snow, saying Rosubud, that he was trying to find. When I was watchnig Citizen Kane I remambered this cartoon and think: THAT'S IT. So the movie's revelation wasn't a surpriese to me, unfortunately. Despite of all movie's magnificence I was ""damaged"" by a cartoon. Funny, isn't it?

Behind all that, Citizen Kane is the American cinema. There is not a major director today who has not been influenced by the genius Orson Welles put forth in his debut masterpiece. The film centers around a group of reporters investigating the origin of the dying newspaper tycoon (loosely based on William Randolph Hearst), Charles Foster Kane's last word: Rosebud.
The movie begins with an unforgettable newsreel montage summarizing the man's life. From there on, the viewer is thrown into a gloriously chaotic world of flashbacks upon flashbacks, in which the viewer slowly learns just about everything about Charles Foster Kane's enthralling life. From his trying childhood to his rise to power to the pinnacle of his success to his marital difficulties to his fall from grace, the story of Charles Foster Kane is presented for the viewer in a way that few other movies can offer: magically.
Citizen Kane, arguably, is THE triumph of the American cinema, and one of the greatest films every created. To many, iy is THE greatest. To me, it stands next only to THE GODFATHER.",1031875200,4,1405,4.907563025210084
801784,5,6304119046,"It's truly difficult to come up with anything original to say about Citizen Kane, as it is one of the films that has been endlessly discussed, dissected, and reviewed over the years. To get to the point, though, there IS a reason for all this fuss. Admittedly, Citizen Kane may not be THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME because that title really doesn't have any meaning - there are so many types of films that to compare them ALL in one category is ridiculous.
Nevertheless, as stated earlier, there is a reason why Citizen Kane has been ranked as it has. Although it is easy to dismiss Citizen Kane as no longer being as groundbreaking as it once was, this is a silly way to approach film. So what if it is no longer new technologically? Watched as objectively as possible, like any other film, Citizen Kane is very entertaining and has many obvious merits. For instance, the acting is top notch, as is the insightful, cynical script. Yes, the cinematography is good too.
Just in case there are people out there who aren't familiar with the plot of this film, it is a series of flashbacks on the life of Charles Foster Kane, a man who controlled numerous newspapers and a vast fortune. Many films dealing with tycoons have been made before and since Citizen Kane, but none have been able to deal with the topic as brilliantly as Orson Welles did in his remarkable debut.
Anyhow, it may be that Citizen Kane has aged some, and it is hard to identify ONE FILM as the greatest of all time. But after watching Citizen Kane with an open mind it becomes clear why people might rate it as such - from start to finish, this is a beautifully rendered, interesting, and amusing film. As far as unforgettable moments go, it's tough to beat ROSEBUD! So go see what the fuss is all about and enjoy two hours of classic entertainment!",1030838400,,1817,4.492447129909365

I did exactly that. Well, it is a good movie. The use of lighting, the angle of the camera, blah blah blah. It just doesn't seem original to me. I guess I should blame this on the movie's originality, I mean its technologies are repeated by later movies so so many times, that its originality doesn't look original to me anymore. I guessed out what ""rosebud"" long before the ending, these tricks are no longer new.

Look for brilliant compositions at every turn, particularly when the young Kane is taken from his home by Thatcher and in the night club where Susan Alexander performs.  My least favorite part of the movie:  Kane dancing and singing at the party w/ the greatest newspaper men.  This seems to be Welles wanting to show that he can dance and that he's the master of his domain.  Brilliant transition:

801851,5,6304119046,"I first watched ""Citizen Kane"" in college in a class called history of journalism.  We were drawing parallels between fictional newspaper giant Charles Foster Kane and real-life media mogul William Randolph Hearst.  There are so many coincidences that it's no wonder this film was almost halted before it hit theatres.
But it's still fantastic and especially revolutionary for 1941.  Multi-hyphenate Orson Welles and cinematographer Gregg Tollan employed innovative filmmaking tricks that had never been thought of before.  And Welles delivers a stirring performance as sometimes carefree, sometimes brutal, but always wealthy Kane.  It's an engrossing and interesting story filled with success, heartache, and scandal.
In order to appreciate the caliber of this movie, you must understand film history and how advanced this movie was compared with other films made around the same time.  You must also have some knowledge of Hearst's life so you can appreciate some of the humor and satire.  Otherwise, you will find it boring and certainly won't understand why the AFI called it the greatest movie ever.
Do I think it's the greatest movie ever made?  No.  What is the point in calling a movie the greatest ever made when movies are still being produced today?  Who's to say that a movie won't come along in the future that leaves ""Citizen Kane"" in the dust?  It hasn't happened yet, but it could.  Either way, this film will still have a prominent place in cinema history that will never be taken away from it.",1028073600,4,1512,5.076923076923077
801852,5,6304119046,"Loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, this is the story of the rise and fall of one of the wealthiest men in the world.  It is also the story of a period of time in American history beginning in the 1890s when it seemed that all was possible.  Its innovative film techniques also raised the standard to which the world of film would forevermore have to aspire.
The film begins with the death of the rich man, Charles Forster Kane.  The audience sees newsreel footage about his life and so the general outline is established early.  But when a newspaper reporter now interviews all the people who knew him well, the flashbacks tell the real story.  Orson Wells plays Kane in an outstanding performance, the use of makeup as well as his voice and body language making him age before our eyes.  Joseph Cotton plays his best friend.  And Agnes Moorehead has a small role as his mother.  The rest of the cast's names are less familiar today:  Ruth Warrick is cast as his first wife; Ray Collins as a corrupt politician; Everett Sloan as his business associate; Dorothy Comingore as his second wife.  They were all young unknowns then, and it was Orson Wells' skill that brought out outstanding performances from all.
The Turner Classic Edition of the video I watched included a short piece about the technical aspects of creating the film, which I found fascinating.  According to Robert Wise, who did the film editing, shooting though cheesecloth filled with sand to get a grainy effect created the newsreel shots.  Some shots were done from a camera that was actually placed below floor level and aimed upwards or a ceiling camera aimed downwards. The dominant characters had camera angles aimed upwards at them; the weaker characters were shot with camera angles aimed downward. The film is shot in black and white with high contrast, often having the foreground characters completely in shadow. Often, the features of a character are indistinct and shadowy and it is the voice that carried the action.  Other times, the entire scene is in what is called ""deep focus"" with every bit of it absolutely clear.  It was Wells' genius that made it all work so well.
The film moved fast and held my interest throughout.  There was never a lull or a dull moment because of the technique of overlapping dialog, which moved the viewer from one scene to another with maximum effect.  No detail was left out to make this a perfect film, which can be watched over and over again, just to see its unique composition.  I give this video my highest recommendation.  If you've never seen it, don't miss it.  If you've seen it before, see it again.",1027900800,15,2644,4.696312364425163

Now I understand, thanks mostly to the Roger Ebert commentary on this DVD, which focuses on the technical, production and compositional aspects of the film.  Ebert's commentary on this disc is simply the best I have ever seen on a DVD--time and again Ebert points out and explains brilliant touches and conceptions most of us wouldn't have noticed on our own, and he does it in an earnest, non-condescending, explanatory way.  Illuminating and insightful.  The Bogdanovich commentary is from a different perspective.  It's a little too in-groupy, ""me and Orson,"" for my tastes, but it doesn't merely duplicate Ebert, and adds to my understanding and enjoyment of the movie, even if it's not the eye-opener that Ebert's commentary is.
The companion DVD-Documentary is also illuminating.  Now for the first time I understand Welles's strange lack of success in Hollywood, despite his reputed (and undoubted) genius.

801950,5,6304119046,"The titular Kane is a newspaper baron that starts off young, impetuous, and championing the common man.  As he ages, he becomes less and less attuned to the common man, withdrawing to a gigantic manor named Xanadu, where he dies with only his servants and utters his final word: ""Rosebud.""  The movie starts at Kane's death, and the making of a newsreel of his life.  A reporter sets off to discover the ""secret"" of the man, and to try to find the meaning of his final word.  Thus, the film is set up as a series of flashbacks as old friends and associates reminisce to the reporter about Kane.
Such a dry interpretation of the plot does not do justice to the magic, the humour, and the intricacies of the film.  It is superbly crafted and the performances are top-notch.  The screenplay is witty and the film is watchable over and over because the non-linear nature of the plot keeps you guessing about what will come up next (a credit to editor Robert Wise).
This DVD edition is clean and crisp.  The video is fantastic (perhaps too good - the newsreel, famously dragged around the parking lot by Wise to make it look more realistic, is perhaps too clean).  The sound is okay (but not great).  There are numerous special features.  Some are not very useful, such as layouts of storyboards that are too small (on my system) to see.  Two extras stand out.  The first is the 2-hour documentary on Wells, the movie, and William Randolf Hearst, the alleged basis for the character of Kane.  Instead of focussing on the film and the similarities and differences between Hearst and Kane, it actually compares the lives and careers of Hearst and Wells, only relating to the film character when there is an obvious overlap (e.g., the relationship between Kane/Hearst and their respective mistress-starlets).  The second great extra is the audio commentary by Roger Ebert.  He gives an inside view (culled from books, documentaries, and his own observations) of all aspects of the film, including shot composition, special effects, the actors and crew, etc.  It's a fascinating accompaniment (much better than the trite and dull second commentary by Peter Bogdanovich).

Bogdanovich provides a great amount of insight during the film.  He explains a lot of background into Welles thinking.  The second commentary by Roger Ebert is equally worthwhile.  Ebert spends his time talking about the production aspects of the film.  He explains the lighting and the use of ceilings and the way one-shot scenes and deep focus make the movie a technical miracle.
Besides all of that, you also get a 2-hour documentary on the making of the film and the controversy that surrounded it.

My issues with it are the same as everyone else's, for the most part-- mainly that this is considered a ""great"" film because it popularized innovative technical work decades ago, but for modern audiences will not really notice the breakthroughs. It is a necessity for the film student to watch, and as an engineer, I appreciate Welles' technical determination to do the work he wanted to do. Lay audiences are quite justified and reacting with ""huh?"" when told it is ""the best film ever made.""
My unique issues regarding the main weakness of this film can be borne out in the other reviews themselves-- generally, even hardcore fans don't connect to the characters or has deep abiding affection for the story. It does not emotionally resonate with audiences. For those that love the film, it's because of its connection with Orson Welles-- ""a technical genius!"", ""ahead of his time,"" ""only 25 when he directed, produced, and starred!"" they will say. The connection that fans of this film feel is with the man, Welles, himself, which is why the film has such enduring appeal amongst filmmakers or those who wish they were filmmakers. Many people who are fans of Gone with the Wind or Casablanca couldn't tell you who directed them because fans of those movies identify strongly with the characters and the story and the emotions of those movies, not the process and personality of the man who made them. By contrast, the connection fans of Citizen Kane have is not with Citizen Kane the character but Orson Welles the filmmaker. This makes the movie a wonderful experience for those who want to identify with the technical and professional achievements of Welles, but not for those seeking a more ""human"" connection with the actual characters and experiences depicted in the film itself.
Orson Welles was the best filmmaker of his time, and perhaps all time (Hitchcock being his main competition for this title).

The innovations Welles and Toland made in the cinematography and as a director were years and years ahead of their time. The makeup and art direction is Oscar Worthy. Even Robert Wise's editing was well done. Welles use lighting, the deep focus, long takes, and low angles was revolutionary. Sure, there are several plot holes and continuity goes all to hell, but you don't notice it. That's how much the movie captures you visually, and with the superb acting from Welles, Joseph Cotton, Everette Sloan, and Dorothy Comingore you don't notice until you've seen it several times. Oh, and before I forget, Hermann was the composer.
The DVD itself has a lot of great features, this is how a DVD should be made. It is a 2 disc set that is packaged beautifully in a slipcover case.

On every level of craft and artistic integrity, this movie is well-deserving of the title of best movie ever made.  Even today, the film looks absolutely beautiful, and its sheer style is still admirable. The rich black-and-white picture looks absolutely fantastic, and the realism in the acting and emotions on EVERY player's part is so authentic, it really makes you feel like your watching old news reels from the 1940s.  Every film class should offer a course on this film's cinematic brilliance and mastery of craft.  There is no doubt about that in my mind, because from a technical standpoint this film just appears absolutely flawless.
Well, that being said, now I must speak a more personal opinion about this movie.  The story itself is not nearly as exciting or involving as I was expecting when I first watched it, and when it all comes down to it, I personally, don't think that it by any means even has that remarkable of a story.  It's not that the story isn't good, its just not all that interesting.  Bottom line.  I can think of many, many other movies that were much more mind-blowing and held my interest much better than 'Citizen Kane' did.  I don't know that that necessarily makes them BETTER movies, but it's all relative.  There are many things that make a movie good - the direction, the camerawork, the storyline, the acting, and its very difficult to base a movie's greatness on ONE of these things.  I own 'Citizen Kane', and I've watched it probably four or five times, but not necessarily because I enjoy it, but just to further study it from a technical standpoint, including the lighting, the innovative camera angles, Orson Welles' incredible performance and every other element that seems to make it so revered in the hallowed halls of film greats.  Pretty much, my lifelong ambition has been to be a filmmaker, and there are few films that are more of a credit to their artform than 'Citizen Kane'.  So, if you are a movie nut, then you need to see and appreciate this.  Just don't be afraid to be critical of it.",1018310400,4,2224,4.654731457800511
802067,5,6304119046,"When you start to realize how many ""first times"" this movie contains, and when it was made, there's no wonder that it's been deemed the best movie of all times. It was the debut in the director's seat of also first-time big screen actor, co-writer and producer, Orson Welles. He was surrounded by a cast of experienced actors, most of which were new to the big screen as well: there goes a couple of ""first times."" In terms of the script, the fast-forward and rewinding of events into the future and back to the past is simply mind-boggling. Welles accomplishes the magical time shifts by resorting to some pretty nifty editing tricks (fading out, fading in, etc.) This might be something that movies such as Pulp Fiction or Memento have us a little more used to these days, but Citizen Kane broke film-making ground when it accomplished this back 1941. Also, the content of the script itself was very controversial back then, due to the fact that it was ""loosely based"" on a real-life big media mogul, William Randolph Hearst. This caused the movie to suffer all kinds of oposition and delays at the time, in spite of the fact that the contract Welles signed with RKO for the movie was one that allowed him creative freedom in ways that are evident all through the movie, and that can be the envy of today's Hollywood's directors. Yet, as controversial as the story was ""outside,"" the story itself is based on a concept that strikes for its simplicity: ""Rosebud,"" Charles Foster Kane's last word, and the pursue of its meaning by a team of journalists, among the people that supposedly knew the man well. Supposedly, because appearances can be deceiving...
Illumination is simply fantastic: the game of shadows and bright lights to cast more suspense or cheer up a particular scene is superb. The angles from which the actors are shot at times, break not only the normally accepted paradigms of directing at the time, but also the studios floors (since they required the use of a hatchet to make way through the wooden floors, down to a point where the camera could be placed at footstep level.) The effect this accomplished in terms of the scenes shot this way was amazing, since dominant (power) characters where shot from below, thus making them ""larger"" and more imposing than they would have looked like, had they been shot normally. Likewise, submissive or powerless characters were shot from above, much from the perspective of the dominant characters.
Some scenes are worth a thousand Oscars, one of my favorite ones being the one where one of the reporters walks into this huge room under custody and is furnished with a book from the diaries of another wealthy man who was close to Kane, in order to read about Kane in it. The scene is just magnificent, in terms of illumination (shadows below, god-like illumination from above), camera angle, script, everything... And this one is only one of several, that make up a movie that has stood the test of time, and has become a pivotal influence to most of today's directors. I hope I have made my point, but if I haven't, long-story, short: you can't afford not to see ""Citizen Kane.""",1018051200,2,3142,4.735401459854015
802068,5,6304119046,"In June 1998, on a much-publicized list, the American Film Institute named ""Citizen Kane"" America's Greatest Movie, sparking a controversy that rages to this day. Since then, when people watch ""Citizen Kane"", they've been analyzing it and dissecting to see why it made the list. They completely have forgotten what made it so great.
I am one of those who think any greatest movie list is ridiculous (Though, if asked to, I would make up a list). How can you judge the greatness of movies by ranking them 1,2,3? And what would you judge them by? Entertainment or artistic value? That is why most critics, when they make ""greatest"" lists, rank them alphabetically. However, I believe the best way is for a person to have several favorite movies and, if they are asked what is their favorite, they can name one of those. But they should also know why. ""Citizen Kane"" is one of these I would name because it's so creative. Every scene is a delight to watch in terms of cinematography, lighting, sound, writing, music or acting. Almost the entire cast was in their film debuts. Orson Welles, Joe Cotton, Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Erskine Sanford, William Alland, Paul Stewart and George Coulouris are all excellent and most would have long, productive careers. It's difficult to name who is the best, but I think that Cotton (For his talk to Mr. Kane while drunk), Sloane (For his speech about the girl with the white dress) and Moorehead (For her scenes at the boarding house) were the best.
My favorite quote from the movie comes early, in the newspaper office scene between Welles and Coulouris. Here, after being asked by Coulouris ""Is this really your idea of how to run a newspaper?!"" Welles remarks ""I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher, I just try everything I can think of"". As stated before, Welles and almost everyone else involved had no previous film experience, yet had been landed a huge contract to have full creative control on a movie. Much of Hollywood was envious at this and looked down upon Welles, hoping he would fail. However, Welles and company took advantage of any thing they had and doing anything and everything they could think of in the movie. No idea was too large or too small. One example was with the plot device, the last word of Charles Foster Kane called ""Rosebud"".
Film Critic Pauline Kael once called ""Rosebud"" a gimmick. Admittedly, this is correct. It seems to explain everything, but really doesn't explain a thing. What makes the movie's story so great though is that it gives us the inside on a rich and famous celebrity, the kind we are always interested in. Rosebud is the key of newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson (Alland), as well as ours, to unlocking the life of Charles Kane. Contrary to some statements, we really never sympathize with him during the story since he is a jerk. He uses people to his own advantage and kicks anyone around who gets in his way. Nevertheless, his story is fascinating. The screenplay by Welles and Herman Mankiewicz (Surprisingly, the film's only Oscar winner) was one of the first to take liberties in the plot. It doesn't have a linear narrative, but rather jumps from interview to interview, from event to event. Gaps made by one interview are filled by another and oftentimes a new gap is created.
However, there are other elements that make the film work. In addition, there is the photography of Gregg Toland (The only major team member with previous film experience), the film editing courtesy of Robert Wise (Who would become a great director in his own right), and the sound created by Bailey Fesler and James G. Stewart. One must also cite Maurice Seiderman's makeup work, which convincingly makes many of the actors look aged. In fact, some of the actors would resemble their older characters in later years (Compare Welles's appearance as the older Mr. Kane with his Detective Quinlan in 1958's ""Touch of Evil""). Blend all these elements together, allow to bake and you got a great movie. Even after 60+ years of age, the movie is still as fresh and entertaining as though it were made yesterday, just as it will be 60 years from now.
If you decide to watch the movie for the first time, do not expect it to be the greatest movie you have ever seen. Instead, don't expect anything. Only expect another movie and you will get your money's worth. On the cinema mountain range, there are few on or near the same height as this one in terms of artistic and entertainment value. Sadly, many of today's teenagers aren't getting raised on films like this. In fact, when I told someone about this movie recently, he said ""Citizen Kane? Is that a movie?"" Most unfortunate, especially since the filmmakers of tomorrow need better inspiration than from today's good but largely forgettable movies.",1017619200,3,4840,4.769964243146603
802069,5,6304119046,"i had this film as an assignment in a film noir class. i'd never seen it before and had read very little about it, knew nothing of the plot, or who bill hearst was, etc etc. if you'd asked me about ""rosebud,"" i'd have assumed it was an obscene reference (and according to roger ebert it is). i was essentially unbiased as to the content of the film.
on first viewing i found it ""sentimental,"" yet effective for the really good (by any standards) performances of welles, cotton, et al. it's a ""life story,"" quite literally, from early childhood to death, of a larger-than-life figure; so it's bound to impress the viewer with the sheer scope of its subject and its inevitable tackling of monumental life issues, including the meaning of life itself in a way more direct, really, in its simplicity than has ever been achieved before or since in cinema. the ultimate sentiment implied by the word ""rosebud,"" the snow-globe, the sled itself, is that of childhood innocence lost. that winter day when his mother handed him over to the bank might have been the last of his life. there is the idea that the world and worldly life corrupt the soul, and that his mother, though she may have felt she was acting in his interest, had therefore sold his soul to the devil as it were that day and sealed his fate.
there were a few points i missed the first time through, so i decided to watch it again with one of the commentaries - roger ebert's. this is certainly one of the better commentaries i've heard on dvd; all too often they degenerate into brainless pedantic ramblings that have nothing to do with anything, but ebert brings his knowledge of the making of the film, of welles himself, of the sundry ground-breaking techniques and effects used in the film - nearly every shot is a special effect - and of the many layers of meaning in the elements of the story, adding comprehensively to one's knowledge and appreciation of the film. plus he actually talks about the scenes that are on the screen as he's talking. how often can you say that. so i watched the whole thing again, and the vista widened.
the next day i watched it again, this time with the peter brogdonovich commentary. this was just as informative as ebert's, and by the time it was over, i felt like i'd made the damn movie. i also felt like i never wanted to see it again, it having occupied something like 9.5 of the last 24 hours of my life. of course, i did watch parts of it again and again as i wrote my paper.
by the way i got an ""a"". these director commentaries on dvds are great for film classes. (the teacher recommended we watch them, i wasn't ""cheating"" at all.) very comprehensive and facinating. oh - i watched that hearst documentary and the ""making of"" thing too, they also helped a great deal. i bought this dvd for this asignment, but i haven't watched it since my paper, i admit - i did burn myself out on it. but it's still a powerful movie, unique in the history of cinema for the degree of nigh-omnipotence the hollywood ""powers that be"" allowed to be invested in one genius - the 26-year-old orson welles - to realize the project, and for the inevitable epoch-making backlash thereby incurred, which really did cripple welles' career permanently and probably set everybody back a few decades.
a legendary film in every sense.  i can't believe another reviewer called it ""boring"" but hey, no accounting for tastes.  he probably thinks ""dude wheres my car"" is the paradigm.",1017273600,2,3457,4.538461538461538
802070,5,6304119046,"This film is a masterpiece. The last tycoon of the first half of the twentieth century. A power and an influence entirely based on newspapers and a new way to practice journalism : journalism as a reality show. Kane has the tendency though to think he can mould the opinions of people as if he controlled them through his papers. The film is a sad demonstration of the impact of such journalism and at the same time its limits and its failures. Actually he is destroyed in his political career by the same papers and journalism that all the other papers immediately imitated because the circulation of Kanes papers was menacing the others to be crushed down into oblivion. But the film also explores the personal dimension of the character, his pharaonic ambition, his cult of collecting artistic artefacts or any other collectibles, his love for his second wife and its inevitable end because she could not live up to his dream of being some kind of king or god on earth. She felt abandoned and crushed by the famous palace of Xanadu and finally decided to leave. Strangely enough the film does not emphasize the death of his son, from his first marriage, a death that must have been particularly dramatic to Kane. The film is also a masterpiece by its technique and the way the story is unveiled and developed. It tried all kinds of story-telling techniques, a film in the film, a musical in the film, a jounalistic investigation within the journalistic world of Kane, and a completely exploded plot line that follows the investigation more than chronology. Things come apparently haphazardly though in an absolutely planned way. The structure is not clear cut and onesided, but rather a multifarious and multifacetted structure that gives to the film a tremendous power and dynamism.

Though it is true that some are bored by the movie because it's ""just a boring black-and-white movie with no action"", those who hold that opinion are in the minority. KANE is often held as the pinnacle of filmmaking by movie buffs not just because of the advances the movie made in film production, but also because it set the standard that all filmmakers wish to reach: the total director's vision; a movie made with total control and no studio intervention. With that said, what does KANE hold for the average film-goer? The movie has an excellent script (it won an Oscar), great acting, and a haunting score. The story, though loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, is an old one: powerful man starts out promising and full of ideals, becomes consumed by greed and loses his vision, and ends up losing it all (anyone read Macbeth or ALL THE KING'S MEN?). Overall, a deeply penetrating and thinking movie that film buffs usually love and that most everyone else will at least enjoy if they don't mind a strong drama filmed in black and white.",1016496000,,1147,4.627450980392157

I stopped pretending fifteen minutes into the movie and was not only entertained by the movie, but by my grandfather's incite on the movies of this era and breakthroughs this particular one brought to the movie industry. the fading in and out of scenes, the ending focus on ""rosebud"", etc. and the acting which was not a dramatic portrayal, but an almost real one compared to the acting of that era was something you only see again maybe 15-20 years later. Since then, I have seen it two other times and as a 23 year old and then a 26 year old, found it even more riveting. so why not five stars? Well, it is still a movie from a different time and has that time stamped on it from the very beginning. I still watch old movies trying to broaden my horizons (whatever that intails), but I can't find that common cultural binding point with them and they fail me. Orson Welles did that.

802144,5,6304119046,"I first saw Citizen Kane in the mid-'80s in an Intro to Film class at Community College.  I took the class because I thought it would be an easy A.  As it happens, I got a B+.  Anyway, I was prepared for a 2 hour yawn festival.  A cure for insomnia. As it happened, I was hooked by the 'newsreel' footage.  The whole Rosebud thing and Kane himself were a facinating mystery.
I thought the characters were better drawn out in 'Kane' than in many of the films I usually enjoyed.  The friendship that Kane & Leland had was particularly well developed.  It just felt like Orson Welles had really put his heart into the film.  One didn't get the impression that he was in it just for the money.  The fact that the film is Black & White just adds to the beauty and mystery of this film.
I'm not the type of person who likes a film just because
 it's soooo intellectual.  I do find 'Citizen Kane' to be a very smart film, though, and a film that one needs to pay attention to during their viewing.  Unfortunately, most people see film or TV as a merely passive activity, which you shouldn't have to actively participate in with the ol' noggin.  One really does need to pay attention to the details to really 'get' this film.
'Citizen Kane' is a great film, one of the greats of all time.  The greatest of all time?  Beats me.  I have seen too many films and find it impossible to narrow it down to one great film of all time.  'Kane' is even, perhaps, a tad bit over-rated, but I can find very few films made before or since that are as well crafted as 'Citizen Kane'.  Kane proves that one can make a film with a big visual impact without CGI, blue screens, chase scenes, or big explosions.  Perhaps some reviewers were bored with the film because it lacks explosions and enormous dinosaurs!?
The DVD package is superb.  The picture quality is very close to perfect. The best quality I've ever seen on a film this old.  It looks better than some of modern films that I've viewed on DVD.
The sound is great, too.  It's mono sound, but come on, this film was released in 1941, many decades away from Dolby Digital Stereo sound. The commentaries by Roger Ebert & Peter Bogdanovich are great, with Ebert's being the most informative, in my opinion.  The documentary on disc 2, which is just a few minutes shorter than the actual film gives a lot of insight into the battles had over the film with William Randolph Hearst, who supposedly inspired the film.

The plot of the film, the rise and fall of multi-millionaire and newspaper emperor Charles Foster Kane, is known to most fans of film...So what makes it so great?  I think lots of people will tell you that Welles' innovative camera angles, beautiful cinematography, great Mercury Players all contribute to the brilliance of the film.  For me, though, no film has ever been a better study of the best and worst of human nature.  Kane (and Welles too, for that matter) was an extremely gifted man who was able to control nearly everything he touched.  What so many of us wouldn't give to have what Kane had.  Kane never asks the question on-screen, but you know what is going through his mind:  ""Is this all there is?""  What a powerful study of a man of power and influence.
'Citizen Kane' is such a film of staggering proportions, it has been imitated countless times, but never equalled.  Welles truly was a genius and even if he never surpassed 'Kane' himself, the film will continue to live on as the standard against which all other films are measured.  It is truly greatness.
But there's more.  'The Battle Over Citizen Kane,' the second disc is just as great as the feature.  The story behind the film is an amazingly informative and entertaining feature.  See how 'Kane' came to life and how it almost died before it was ever born.  An amazing tale.

802149,5,6304119046,"In his commentary on this DVD director Peter Bogdanovich remarks on how Orson Welles once told him that while aspects of Citizen Kane had been mightly influential, (deep focus, overlapping dialogue, having the ceiling in a shot,) the things that Welles thought truly important about the film were never widely used by film-makers. Bogdanovich doesn't elaborate on what exactly the Master considered the important aspects of the film but from what I know about Welles I would have to think that what he considered truly valuable about Kane was its use of illusion, misdirection, and audience expectation to tell the tragic story of Charles Foster Kane.  From a dramatic standpoint Welles' goal was to produce a truly Shakespearean vision in then modern day America but from a cinematic view the film-maker's intent remained true to the qualities he had brought to both his stage and radio productions.  Namely ambiguity, uncertainty, magic.  Nothing in Kane is as it seems.  Temporal and spatial perception are as malleable as the ore which gave Kane his wealth. Characters walk into photographs, Newsreels become real, locations freeze into newspaper headlines.  One such headline famously describes Kane's love Susan Alexander as ""singer"".  Jed Leland says Kane ""spent his whole life trying to remove those quotes.""  But all of Citizen Kane is in quotes.
The DVD is excellent, the film looks spectacular, and the extras are fun.  The commentaries by Ebert and Bogdanovich are fascinating.  Ebert's commentary focuses more on the film, with almost shot by shot explanations of what's going on, while Bogdanovich's comments are more personal, more concerned with warm anecdotes about his friend Orson.  There are at least two 'Easter Eggs' contained in the menu selection, one an interview with Robert Wise, the other with Ruth Warrick.  Both are interesting, if too short. The American Experience documentary on Disc 2 provides the fascinating backstory behind the film's production, but I, for one, believe one shouldn't make too much of 'Kane-Hearst' parallels or 'Kane-Welles' parallels, for that matter.  The joy of the film rests in its timeless inventiveness; its examination of both the historical and the ephemeral, and how the two intertwine; the humor, warmth, and pathos of the characters.

I'd come down on the side of this being an amazingly well-written, engaging movie, myself. Hey, I was one of those skeptics when I first saw Kane, but it's a great story, told in a really winning way, with fantastic acting and a real sense of honesty to everything about it.
Even leaving that alone, though -- wow, does this DVD ever understand what makes you want a DVD.
First of all, the image transfer is astonishingly clean. If you have an old tape of this movie, you're going to sit up in your chair three or four times and realize you never even saw this or that whole scene before; the images are that much clearer than your bleary old VHS copy. It has that visual zing that you get from really good DVDs.
Then there are the extras. You get a whole extra two hours' worth of the American Experience episode, which is extremely satisfying entertainment for anyone who's ever liked a televised biography. (American Experience bios are sometimes breathtakingly good, and this is a superb example.) You get original storyboards for scenes. You get letters from Orson Welles. You get studio memos from the censors. You get production photos. The two soundtracks' worth of commentary are quite different, complementing each other well, and both of them are good fun. (I wish Roger Ebert could stop talking long enough to breathe, or that the sound balance was a little lower [or less consistent] on him during his soundtrack, but he has a lot to offer.)
If you're on the fence, Kane is absolutely worth buying in this form. The only DVD I've been quite this impressed by is the Criterion Collection version of The Third Man, for similar reasons: superb restoration; loads of fun extras; and a dazzling, classic, complex and satisfying movie to begin with.",1011225600,19,1890,4.695783132530121
802245,4,6304119046,"In order to survive the passing years, a film must be able to transcend the limitations of the era in which it was made.  This is a difficult test, particularly for films that largely rely upon new technology and innovative technique for impact: as these new effects are seen more often in other films, we come to accept them as standard, and in consequence the film that introduced them no longer has same the freshness as once it did.
To a certain extent CITIZEN KANE faces precisely this problem.  A pioneer in the use of deep focus photography and in innovative editing, KANE stunned audiences of its day with a powerful visual and aural montage.  Some forty years later, however, most filmgoers have had at least some opportunity to see other and later films that at least approximate KANE's effects; consequently, these elements lack the same impact they once had, and the film must increasingly rely upon story, script, and performances for continued appeal.  And it is here that KANE runs into a bit of trouble.  The story KANE tells is quite cold, and although the script has incredible precision, bite, and complexity, it ultimately presents its characters as second-rate personalities who prove unable to transform their lives into anything beyond the pathos they so deplore.  They are not likable enough to be sympathetic, they are not dark enough to fully stir our curiosity, and for all Charles Foster Kane's millions they ultimately emerge as merely so many opportunity-squandering unfortunates.  As such, while they certainly engage the viewer in an intellectual sense, they seldom engage the viewer in an emotional one; this coupled with the fact that the film's technique no longers offers quite the same shock-of-the-new as once it did makes CITIZEN KANE increasingly problematic with the passage of time.
There is a tremendous amount to admire in CITIZEN KANE, but with each passing year it becomes more and more of a historian's darling and less and less of a film that remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels.  Even so, it is (and will no doubt for the foreseeable future remain) a landmark film, one that will be worthy of considerable reverence for many years to come.",1011052800,4,2212,4.911528150134048

Some say ""Godfather"", others ""The Matrix"" (usually adolescent males), ""von Stroheim's ""Greed"" (my own choice), ""The Bicycle Thief"", etc. Those who like ""Citizen Kane"" tend to be very, very liberal and a bit anti-american (either by being snobs or by being anti-capitalist) as they relish its story of how money and power corrupts, as if money and power can only corrupt Americans (Hello? Has anyone heard of the Medici's?). These fans of the film gleefully point to the film as some kind of indictment of the american dream. It is nothing of the sort. It is the indictment of one man, a fictional character who never existed. Any attempt to condemn the real life Hearst because of the film ""Kane"" is grossly unfair. For one thing, Heart's mistress, Marion Davies, was a talented comedienne (See the video ""Show People"") not the no-talent dummy portrayed in the film. Rather than being a major anti-capitalist statement, the film is simply a very lukewarm melodrama. It is also absurd and just plain silly, also. I won't tell you what ""Rosebud"" is (so as not to ruin the film for you if you haven't seen it) but it has to be the stupidest plot device and conclusion in film history. Anyone who doesn't finish watching the ending with either hysterics, or a deep sense of resentment that such a build up should have such a major let down needs to have their head examined.

I find it nothing but a moderately engaging curiousity.",1010707200,6,1708,4.60327868852459
802247,5,6304119046,"Is this Welles' greatest film? That's open to debate but it is a stunning debut that set a standard difficult to follow. At the ripe old age of 26 after a steady diet of theater, literature and performance Welles decided to turn his gaze on the one art form he really hadn't mastered. After watching John Ford's Stagecoach (and one can assume a number of Hitchcock films as well), Welles and his collaborators Herman J. Mankiewicz, cinematographer Gregg Toland and film editor Robert Wise created one of the enduring classics of American cinema.

Edit: The Blu-ray edition of this film is exceptional and an improvement over the previously over processed DVD released a decade ago. Warner has done an exceptional job of restoring the film to Blu-ray providing fans with a sharp looking presentation with previously unnoticed detail (at least on home video) and a far more film-like presentation.

Keep in mind that while Welles was in charge, Mank, Toland and Wise all played a substanial part in helping to create this classic film. All of this helps explain why Welles had a difficult time following up on Kane; he only worked with Toland and Wise once again and never with Mank. The Magnicient Ambersons is a near classic that fails primarily because of the botched version eventually released.

This deluxe set has all the extras you could possibly ask for: the commentary tracks by Ebert and Bogdonovich are complimentary and quite different; the documentary is quite good at illuminating the infighting that went on in creating this film. This edition on Blu-ray includes ""RKO 281"" the docudrama about the making of the film from HBO.

For those who appreciate Welles' film this is the ultimate edition.

Highly recommended.",1009065600,2,1730,4.972318339100346

The film itself is pure genius - a magical tale of the creation of a media empire and how the empire came crumbling down, evenly sprinkled with comedic wit and cinematic innovation. The additional documentary, The Battle over Citizen Kane, delves into the fight between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst (the inspiration for Kane), and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1995.

Ebert's commentary adds to this DVD an entertaining and enlightening lecture on the art of film-making.  In my opinion, that commentary alone is worth the price of the disk, and provides a benchmark against which other DVD commentaries might get measured.  Given that Citizen Kane, itself, is a benchmark film, this is probably only fitting.",1007942400,,526,4.8

What I will comment on is the DVD and some of its special features.  As far as the DVD quality goes, this is a great transfer of this film.  I've seen it quite a few times on TV and video, but its never looked as great as this.
However, more than any other reason, you should get this disc for the special features.  Particularly the two commentaries by Roger Ebert and Peter Bogdanovich.  These commentaries give amazing insight into the movie and the making of the movie.  They enhance your enjoyment of the film because of the things you may not have noticed or realized during previous viewings.  The commentaries discuss everything from how a shot was created to why the shot was chosen.  There are a lot of revolutionary movie making techniques that were created during the making of this movie that we may not have realized because they are so commonplace in modern movies.  These commentaries let us know exactly what those revolutionary technics are and why they are important.
The Ebert review is my favorite.  He keeps you interested through the whole movie and has great insight into the movie.  Although repetitive at times and a bit rushed (which is the nature of the format since he can't exactly pause the movie for you to discuss an item at length... although that would be a very cool feature).  The Bogdanovich commentary was good as well, but a bit dry and boring at times.  He didn't have the same enthusiasm during the commentary as Ebert, but I think that's the nature of Bogdanovich and not because he isn't enthusiastic about the film.

The movie, supposedly based on the true-life news tycoon Hearst, is truly boring.  While technically it has a lot of merits -- the editing, the cinematography, the make-ups -- the story itself is really difficult to follow.  I paused the movie numerous times, because it was painful to go on watching it.
After finally finishing the entire movie, I took out a few books on movies and read the relevant chapters on Citizen Kane.  Of course they all sang high praises to the film.  Then I watched it again, this time looking for the ""classic"" moments as described in the books, but once again I found the film disorienting and painful to watch.
If you've never seen this movie, you may want to rent it first to see if you can stand it.  If you like it, you may consider the DVD edition with an extra DVD on how the movie was made (an equally boring documentary).",1006128000,16,992,4.417582417582418
802321,4,6304119046,"""Citizen Kane"", based loosely, on the life of newspaper publisher W. R. Hurst, is as controversial a film as it is important.  Orson Welles is supurb in the leading role, portraying the rags to riches newspaper publisher who becomes more stingy and cold as his riches and popularity, and power, increase.
New techniques in film making, also Welles doing, gives the movie more depth.  Fast cuts, and overlapping dialogue are Welles doing.  Watch for the close ups, and scenes where the camera pans directly down from the ceiling - also Welles innovation.  They are standard now, but never would have been but for Welles.
The story begins with Kane on his deathbed, uttering that immortal and illusive word ""rosebud"".  He dies.  No sooner than he is buried than an extensive search is made to discover what the meaning of ""rosebud"" is.  Newspaper reporters visit close friends, and distant enemies of Kane to gather insight.
Now, the movie changes.  A biography of the man's life is unfolded, unraveled, and, at times, maliciously documented; and depending on who is telling the story, Kane is either hero or villian.
We see Kane as a little boy, being dragged away from his parents to live in wealth and comfortability.  He does not want to leave his mother; though it is at her insisting he leave, for the sake of his future.  The frame cuts, and it is now 20 years later, and enter Orson Welles.  Kane is a young man now, headstrong, ambitious, and power hungry; a shell of the innocent boy we saw only minutes earlier.  His life has changed.  But is it what his mother had wanted?
Throughout the rest of the film, Kane ages as fast as his character develops more hunger and thirst for power, always putting his work ahead of friends and family; lusting for more, more, more, and never satisfied ... until he ultimately destroys himself.
The movie can be a bit long at times, and, as I have done, have the viewer fidgeting in his seat, wondering when the action will pick up.  However, that is the movie's only flaw.  I found ""Citizen Kane"" to be a great pyschological drama which I have enjoyed watching many times.",1005782400,,2117,4.683783783783784

Thank god no ""5.1 ehnancement"" was applied to ruin it. I mean really, that would be like going back to the Mona Lisa and making it more colorful.  This film is the Mona Lisa, and this is the best lighting in which to see it.",1005350400,,510,4.28125
802324,5,6304119046,"Is Citizen Kane the best film ever?  I don't know.  I'm not sure it's either possible or advisable to quantify art in such a manner.  I love it.  I also love Young Frankenstein.  Is THAT the best film ever?  Probably not.  Best is a lousy word to bandy about here.  Is this an extremely lovingly-made issue of a classic, influencial piece of particularly well-realized film history?  ABSOLUTELY.
Like it or not, Kane had a massive influence on nearly everything that followed, all the way up to Pulp Fiction.  Simply put, my recommendation would be to get this DVD for three reasons.  It's a foundation of the techniques we take for granted in  film today.  It's a beautifully done set of DVDs, extras galore & a stunning transfer.  It's an engrossing character study/morality tale set up in a challenging non-linear story.  As for the rest of fine reasons to own it, other more eloquent reviewers have already weighed in.  Check 'em out.
One or two caveats.  This movie isn't for everyone by any means.  Want to sit back and simply be entertained?  This may not be your cup of tea.  As I said, the narrative isn't plot driven so much as a lifelong character study, so it may not immediately engage you the way, say, Rear Window might.  Certainly this isn't for everyone.  Often artistic achievments aren't (I still can't get into The Sound & The Fury; I respect it, but I just can't enjoy it; Oh well).
(...) As many have mentioned, widescreen didn't happen in the theaters until 1953, partially as a reaction to television in the home as a way of setting movies apart & attempt to regain lost audience.  The aspect ratio of Kane is almost identical to that of your standard TV, so pop it in and for once enjoy a bit of art appropriate without black bars.
I suppose in summation I should say that this is a wonderful, challenging, idiosyncratic work, full of amazing and groundbreaking technique, presented in a beautifully wrought DVD that does justice to it's rank as a great film, and that many people predisposed to rankings feel it's the best film of all time.",1005091200,,2066,4.615384615384615
802325,5,6304119046,"This film is without a doubt my favorite film of all time. The reason for this is that this film contains so much that has later become standard in movies. The gorgous photography, which looks even better on this magnificent DVD, the acting, dialogue, music, story, special effects. Everything about this movie is done perfectly. When one sees this film, it seems as though the film costed almost as much as any high budget film in Hollywood, but it wasn't. Welles planned the film down to each shot, which is why he made those transitions so perfectly and seemlessly.
(...)This film, like all films made in the sound period before 1953, was photographed in the Academy ratio, which was 1.37:1. Since the television screen has an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, would the picture have minor cuts on the sides. This film, though, is photographed making full use of the width of the screen, so on the Criterion laserdisc version of this film were there a couple of scenes that the extreme left or right side was cropped, but on this transfer have they fixed this. If one talks about that a film that was orginally filmed at a ratio of 1.37:1 would have to be letterboxed to be able to see the whole picture, is that person just being silly. It simply would not be worth the effort, in comparision to transfering films that were filmed in the old Cinemascope ratios of 2.35:1 and 2.55:1 that would badly need letterboxing. But such a picture didn't come out until 'The Robe(1953)', 'How to Marry a Millionaire(1953)' and 'White Christmas(1953)' when CinemaScope and VistaVision was introduced.",1004918400,,1582,4.7773722627737225

Matter of debate, but it is undeniablely one of the masterworks of cinema.  It is a brillant film in structure, techinque, and overall emotional pull.
The best part?  Well, that is an individual choice.  The print is so pristinet that you might have thought it was shot with a digital camera (well, George Lucas is no Orson Welles).  Both commentary tracks are fascinating (Ebert just won a major award for best commentary track of '01), if a bit dry.

Orson Welles inserts his own past, present, and future into the telling of the life of William Randolph Hearst, and the results are less than uplifting.  The young Kane shows an admirable disdain for his money, and money never really gets hold of him, directly; but the power and art that money can buy do indeed take over his soul, and his youthful idealism (or was it just a put-on) gives way to the central fact of his life - ""If I say it is so, it is so, for I am Charles Foster Kane!""

And through his early comings in theater and radio, he soon achieved an unprecedented deal: to make a feature film, no strings attached (an almost impossible thing to comprehend today).  After several mishaps, Welles settled on ""Citizen Kane,"" which utilized incredible cinematography, a great cast of theater actors, and meaningful dialogue and storylines.
  The film starts at the end of a life, with the passing of Charles Foster Kane.  Kane's family inherited a supposedly worthless Colorado mine that tielded untold millions.  His mother put this into a fund for Charles to befully his by his 25th birthday.  Throughout his lifetime, Kane used the moeny for profit, controlling an entire newspaper empire, and also used his wealth for pleasure, buying up countless art treasures, and creating his own heaven on earth, a gigantic private kingdom called Xanadu.
  One news company, while putting together a newsreel of Kane footage, soon realizes that there's no real hook to keep the person interested, until one of them remembers what Kane's last word was: ""Rosebud.""  none of the newsmen know, and one is promptly sent on an investigative search for the truth, tracking down countless friends of Kane, as well as reading the memoirs of the man who was entrusted to be his legal guardian, and a former wife.
  A great bonus on this disc is the documentary ""The Battle over Citizen Kane,"" which tells how William Randolph Hearst, who was somewhat portrayed in the film (Hearst was also a newspaper tycoon, spent frivolously, and created his own private estate), tried to use his power in Hollywood to keep the film from being seen (even having a huge sum of money to destroy the original negative).  Word of mouth kept advertisements from Hearst's papers, and even possibly cost Welles the Oscars (the only one the film won was for screenplay).
  Ok, why am I praising this film and have not given a concrete fact?  Well, here they are: the cinematography is planned out in almost every frame.  things represent a character's power, be it the size of the room or camera position.  Even the actors are the best cast I can think of from that time.  Normally when people look back on films from early cinema, the dialogue seems somewhat stilted.  Here, all the characters talk believably and their actions always come to a great means.
  Orson Welles, being Actor/cowriter/producer/director really did a magnificent job as Kane.  He plays him from the young man, through his leap to bellowing power, and into his old age when he can't quite grasp what he wants.

802407,5,6304119046,"Without a doubt, Citizen Kane is one of the great films made. However, the propaganda machine which is the AFI 100 Greatest American Movies has created a maelstrom around this film which will never end - much like the maelstrom the movie created during its production. Ironic.
The operative word in the AFI list is ""American"", and you also have to ask yourself who are and what is the criteria of the AFI Board that made this list. The fact the the AFI list excludes any and all foreign films (except some of David Lean's work which shouldn't be considered an American film anyway) AUTOMATICALLY handicaps it, if not making it an out right mockery of the concept of a ""Greatest Films"" list. No films by Fellini, Truffaut, Kiewslowski, Kurosawa, Godard, early Hitchcock, Tarkovsky, Fassbinder, Herzog, Bergman! Come on now, those are the filmmakers who helped take film from a maudlin form mass entertainment to a true art form. If one was to examine subsequent lists presented by AFI, you'll understand how hackneyed and meaningless their 100 Greatest American Film List. It's all subjective anyway - filmmakers, particularly, will rate Citizen Kane higher than the typical movie-goer of today for several reasons discussed in other reviews of the film. Kane will have it's place because its a much-talked about film.
With that being said, the film and the DVD version are great. Period. Greatest of All Time, under what criteria. Don't bash the film because it's not to your taste - some might argue that Michaelego's Sistine Chapel is the greatest work of art of all time, others might say any number of works by Picasso or perhaps Mozart's symphonies. To recognize quality is what counts. To dismiss Kane as slow, boring and stupid (which it is CLEARLY not) shows that the viewer/reviewer is lacking in artistic experience. Would one condemn the early Renaissance works of Giotto because they don't do full justice to the human form the way Carravagio does?

802408,5,6304119046,"There is a reason Citizen Kane appears somewhere on just about everyone's Top 10 List of all-time great movies, and it isn't that movie reviewers and movie lovers have gone sappy & sentimental or ""politically correct"" in their estimation of this film.  It is simply because it is still, over half a century later, an astonishing piece of work.  Absolutely stunning, using every trick & device ever invented in movie making, and coming at them with such freshness and originality, decontructing and reconstructing them into something new & unique, that the word ""genius"" was invented to describe such efforts.
I dislike how that word genius is bandied about so much today describing everything from gifted natural athletes to clever comedians and politicians.  I rarely use it myself.  But, if this wasn't a work of genius, I don't know what would qualify.  This is such a grown-up movie, telling an archetypal American story, but with brilliance in every frame and every line of dialogue.  Is is so mature a work, made under the strictures of the Hayes code, that it makes most of what we see today, without virtually any limits, look like the work of children.
AND it was made with such economy!  Really a low-budget project, through sheer brilliance a Big Story is told modestly, without a wasted shot or line of dialogue, by terrific editing and intelligent construction.  Intelligence is what you see everywhere in Citizen Kane, especially in its humor...and funny it is as well.
I could go on, but why bother? If you don't ""get it"" if you find it ""boring"" nothing I say will change your mind.  I will say this, if that is  your reaction, you know nothing about film-making.  Citizen Kane is an exhaustive primer in brilliant film-making.  Welles threw in the kitchen sink!  That it was a 25 year old's first movie , while not important to your enjoyment or appreciation of the film, is finally just awsome.  The continual inventiveness in scene after scene is dizzying.
The DVD has lots of goodies.  An excellent documentary on the background of the struggle to make and release the film and William Randolph Hearst's (somewhat understandable) effort to destroy it.  There are comments and even regrets by Welles...he was a young man tearing down an old man and there is cruelty in it.  There are 2 very different and excellent commentary tracks by Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert.  The former more a friend's recollections, the latter an intense analysis of the art of the film-making.  All in all, a very nice package.
The restored film is beautiful.
One of my oldest memories is sitting in front of a B&W television mesmerized by the opening of Citizen Kane.  I must have been 10, and I don't recall if I watched it all, and certainly wouldn't have understood it all, but I was completely entranced by the sheer look of the film.  I had never seen anything like it.  It was pure Magic!  And ""magic"" it remains to film lovers the world over.  Nuff said.",1002672000,4,2962,4.774066797642436
802459,5,6304119046,"Okay, so I stole the title of this review from Pauline Kael.  Sue me. Yet without Ms. Kael's revivalist view of ""Citizen Kane,"" this work of art would never have finally achieved the prominence it so deserves on the mantle of great cinema.  I'd practically worn out my VHS of the movie, which was not made from an exactly pristine print of the film, so when I watched the DVD it was like seeing the movie again for the first time.  This new digitally remastered version is almost too gorgeous, too perfect to put into words.  Glancing through the other reviews I saw mention of James Caan, Marlon Brando, and car crashes, none of which you will find in this movie...fortunately.  And as for the movie being ""slow,"" well, if you want slug-brained manic action, rent the ""Die Hard"" series.  ""Kane"" takes its sweet time unfolding a story as complex as a rose, and like a rose, it blooms with intense beauty to reveal a breathtaking finale.  This is filmmaking perfection: flawless and deliberate, ingenious and inspiring.  It is a movie of ""firsts"" from which countless filmmakers have borrowed.  Long before Tarantino was juggling timelines and Stone was mixing media, Welles was treading the fine line between reality and that which imitates it.  Once a movie (or any item) is labelled ""the best of all-time,"" there is a cynical tendency for us to second-guess such an accolade.  But ""Kane"" withstands the test of time and its rewards are even greater and more gratifying than they were the year it was released (and largely overlooked).  For those who appreciate the art of filmmaking in its finest form, ""Kane"" is a wonder to behold, especially when one considers the multi-faceted role that young Welles had in its creation.  It is hard to imagine a 25-year-old artist in this day and age who could co-write, direct, and star in a film that would literally rewrite the lexicon of cinematic language as we know it.  ""Citizen Kane"" is that rare thing of beauty that comes along once in a few lifetimes, and this new DVD, with its informative bonus disk, belongs in the library of everyone who knows that car crashes, explosions, pretentious digital FX, and Keanu Reeves do not a movie make.",1002585600,6,2190,4.744063324538258
802460,5,6304119046,"There are some who do not believe that Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever made.  Some people understand that the film has some remarkable technical innovations, yet still find the film less than compelling.  I can't really explain this reaction to the film, but it exists.  Perhaps if we understood why someone doesn't like Citizen Kane we would also unravel other great film mysteries such as  who would pay full price to see Tom Greene in something like Freddy Got Fingered and who can't wait to see Bio Dome 2.
Not everyone is going to agree it is the greatest film ever made or the most entertaining and once you start calling anything The Greatest of them all a bit of skeptism is likely to rear its head.  One thing is certain, most will appreciate Greg Toland's beautiful use of light and shadow and photographic genius.  And the more you know about how innovative some of the shots were and what lengths it took to accomplish them, you'll appreciate the effort even more.
The life of the fictional Charles Foster Kane is examined in detail.  It all starts with a quest to find out the significance of the last word kane uttered as he died -- Rosebud.  And all of the film techniques used in the film still seem fresh, the symbolism all works perfectly. In fact the film is constructed not unlike some massive reality television specials that might be called... The Unauthorized Biography of Charles Foster Kane. Of course it would be those reality television specials that are poorly mimicking some of the ideas and structures of Citizen Kane and not the other way around.  In other words we're talking about a film that can enjoyed as entertainment, not something that one only appreciates without feeling an affection or warmth toward it.  You can praise the film until you are sick of praising it and still find something in the film, a shot, a camera angle, a dissolve,  an actor's look, a line of dialogue, that will take your breath away.
Except for the barest hint of edge enhancement this is the cleanest, crispest and most beautiful black and white film you've ever seen on DVD.  And it doesn't look overly processed or mechanical.  In fact there are some dark scenes where for the first time I was able to see some details I've never seen before.
The audio is Dolby Digital 1.0.  Rather than artificially enhance and try to remix the soundtrack it was merely cleaned up and presented as clean and crisp as possible.  It might have been nice to have heard a stereo version of Bernard Herrman's magnificent score, but it would seem utterly un-natural to long time fans of the film to have an artificially enhanced stereo surround soundtrack (and the elements probably don't exist to do it anyway).
There's a lot of extras on the DVD's from newsreel clips to secret Easter Eggs to find and enjoy.
There is a generous selection of stills which are automated but can be paused if desired. One of the still galleries contains additional commentary from Roger Ebert.
THE POST PRODUCTION section has four subsections including Deleted Scenes which offers photos, sketches and storyboards that show scenes which did not make the final cut of the film or were abandoned even before they were shot.
If you highlight the sled on the features menu you will see the 5 minute interview with Ruth Warrick who played Emily Norton Kane. She talks about working with Welles and how the film was shot under strict security so no one would know exactly what was being shot or how it was all going to be put together when it was finished.
Click on the sled on the last page of the second section of the production notes for a brief 3 minute interview with director Robert Wise. Wise was the editor on Citizen Kane and he tells the story about meeting Welles for the first and one of the first screenings of the film for very nervous executives and lawyers.
On Disc 2  you will find the full length documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane which was originally aired on P.B.S.'s American Experience Program.
It tells the backgrounds of both William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles.  How their paths crossed, how the two men clashed and how Hearst became obsessed with stopping Kane and destroying Welles' career.  Kane bombed at the box-office but was then nominated for 9 Oscars, however it won only one and afterwards RKO withdrew the film from the market and put it in it's vault for several years.  Hearst's campaign to ruin the film and Welles was pretty effective but he also hurt his own career and reputation in the process.
The first of two feature length commentary tracks is from director Peter Bogdanovich.  Bogdanovich's comments range from discussing the film's technical achievements and analyzing the storyline to recounting conversations he had with Welles about the film.  We learn Kane is not his favorite Welles film.
Roger Ebert's feature length commentary is even more interesting, informative. If you are not quite sure why the film is so highly regarded this commentary will clear it up for you. Ebert spends a lot of time talking about the innovative cinematography (deep focus photography), editing, the special optical effects used to create the imagery in the film and the lighting.  He goes into some detail about the symbolism used throughout the film and how the film was actually very low budget.
Citizen Kane is a masterpiece and this DVD celebrates that by showing off the film at it's very best.  The extra's allow those who have not read several books, or seen documentaries about the film or Hearst and Welles to 'catch-up' with critics and film-buffs.

802461,5,6304119046,"The 60th anniversary restoration of Citizen Kane on dvd is reconstructed from the best remaining film elements, and is absolutely gorgeous (especially breathtaking for those of us who might have been used to seeing the film on scratchy, broken up prints from tv).  The disc also contains two feature length audio commentaries, one by Welles friend, confidante, colleague, and biographer Peter Bogdanovich, and the other by Roger Ebert.

The Bogdanovich commentary combines directorial insights, many from conversations with Welles, inside perspectives that emanate from Bogdonavich's 18 year association with Welles, mixed with an odd, underlying haughty tone.  Why is not clear to me, but might be related to a certain protectiveness of Welles' legacy.  He is never critical of Welles, and presents him in only the best light as friend and artist.  Both have some experiences in common, although each career arrived at their respective stations for different reasons:  Welles career never recovered from the Hearst blacklist (plus Hollywood's  spite and jealously of the extraordinary contract the RKO gave him with unprecedented artistic freedom without having previously directed a film), and Bogdanovich never recovered from decades of mediocre work after a brilliant start (""Last Picture Show"" is a great American film).  However, the content is very interesting, and at times captivating.  Despite my objections, I found his insights illuminating, and certainly added to my enjoyment and appreciation of the film.

The Ebert commentary (IMHO) is more disciplined and complete, and essentially similar to Roger's shot-by-shot analyses that he performs at The Virginia Film Festival (this year at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville from October 25-28) and like venues.  The presentation includes vignettes about Welles and the making of the film, plus Ebert's usual mise-en-scene analysis, which is both entertaining, accessible, and instructive.

I have always enjoyed Kane, but this pristine print makes viewing the film a nearly new experience.  Because Kane is such a great classic, folks can forget how entertaining it is:  there's something for everyone - drama, noir, irony, slapstick, humor, and even a song and dance number!  Happily, there are two discs:  the first contains the film, the two audio commentaries, and some other features.  The second includes and excellent special (originally aired on PBS) on The Battle Over Citizen Kane which chronicles the war between William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles.

In any case, this is one of the great films, and a must for any collection.",1002585600,2,2615,5.462686567164179
802462,5,6304119046,"This is an astounding movie -- made even more so by the fact that Orson Welles was only 25 when he made it.
The camera angles are incrediblely fun to watch. The ""deep focus"" technique of having everything in focus in the foreground and background (no matter how far back) is amazing. And the story never ceases to captivate me -- not to mention depress the heck out of me.
There have been over 270 reviews of this movie, so I'm not going to provide any insights regarding plot or actors. I will comment on one of the DVD's bonus material, though. (I've watched the movie twice -- in one day! -- since the DVD arrived so I haven't delved into all of the bonus stuff yet.)
The Roger Ebert commentary track is extremely enlightning, despite the fact that he never stops talking and you can't hear in the movie what he's referring to. Be that as it may, you'll gain a whole new appreciation for the film once you know all the behind-the-scenes stories.
This movie may take a bit of concentration, a bit of stamina (it seems longer than it really is) and a bit of appreciation for the technical aspects, but it's one that you really must see -- if only to be able to say afterwards, ""I just watched the greatest American film ever made!""",1002585600,3,1232,4.384279475982533
802463,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane is considered by many cinematic experts and the AFI (American Film Institute) to be the GREATEST AMERICAN film of the last 100 years and maybe of all time. With this SPECIAL DVD EDITION set we now can understand the complexity and genius of the film and the characters it portrays.  Many hundreds of reviewers have made comments, given opinions and their ideas about this epic ""CITIZEN KANE"".
I only want to add my observation and enlightenment to this #1 Classic Film.  I was curious to learn why this was voted and acclaimed to be the BEST AMERICAN FILM in the last 100 years.
My advice and conclusions are:
1.) Make this a project (as if it was for school or research).
2.) Understand the world of 1941.
3.) Understand the Characters both real and within the world of Citizen Kane.
4.) Discover the meaning of ""ROSEBUD"".
This DVD set provides all the background and character development (DISC 2).  Once you move into this world you will be ready to enjoy and digest the movie (DISC 1).
This DVD set is a great educational tool to the world of the cinematic genius of Orson Welles and the power of money.  A newly ReMastered Picture and Sound DVD provides the vivid black & white world of ""Citizen Kane"".  After watching & studying all the Special Features, I was ready to graduate to the movie itself.  Now it is to me A Classic, a one time event in the history of cinema.
This is a great experience and with the right investment in time you may to consider ""CITIZEN KANE"" one of the best films ever to bloom from a ""ROSEBUD"" and why.",1002585600,,1551,4.4822695035460995
802464,5,6304119046,"So much praise has been heaped on ""Citizen Kane"" that it seems pointless to add any more adjectives to describe it.  Suffice it to say that Welles's slightly ficitionalized portrait of the rise and fall of one of America's first media barons remains as engaging and enjoyable today as it must have been 60 years ago.
""Citizen Kane"" is a masterpiece of expressionist filmmaking - from its dramatic deep-focus cinematography, to its brilliant compression of dramatic time, and its creative use of staging and matte shots.  But its also a still relevant picture of the contradictions of the American dream - how our native American idealism is compromised and undone by our unyielding drive for power and fortune.  It is, as Ezra Pound would say, ""the news that stays news.""
Warner Brothers has created a handsome edition of this great film.  The print quality is about the best we're likely to get for a film this old and the extra disc has a not-bad documentary about Welles' battle with William Randolph Hearst, on whom the movie was based.  ""Citizen Kane"", and the documentary about it, provide a fascinating look at the intersection of art, commence, and power. An essential DVD.",1002499200,4,1181,4.885
802465,5,6304119046,"The print and transfer on this DVD are nothing short of stunning--  I've never seen the film look this good.  (Makes me sad for all of the classics that only exist in scratchy old dupes; not to mention the ones that don't exist at all any more.)  The extras-- documentary, commentaries, etc.-- are also excellent.  You simply can't ask for a better video presentation (well, short of an HDTV disk).
As for the movie itself, well, I like Welles' followup, ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" a little better, but I have no problem with calling Kane the greatest film ever made.  If you've never seen it (which is likely, since you're reading this), be warned that there's no one thing you'll see that'll make you see the greatness.  In fact, that's kind of what the movie itself is about: looking for simple answers when life is much too complex for that.
Also understand that there's a difference (or there *can be*) between a film that you think is the ""greatest"" and one that is your ""favorite"".  There might be movies I watch more often than Kane, but I still think it's (at the very least) one of the top three or four greatest.  To use a lame analogy, the music you think is the ""greatest"" is probably not what you've got in your CD player right now.
Here's some of what to look for in Kane, if you've never seen it:
The amazing cinematography (the Ebert commentary provides a lot of insight into it, but watch the movie first), which is still a major influence today.
  + The acting, all of which is great.
  + The screenplay, which gives us a large number of multi-layered characters, tightly woven together in a structure that was (and maybe still is) as unique in its day as ""Memento"" is today.
  + The editing, which working in tandem with the cinematography and screenplay is not only revolutionary, but cleverly brings more depth to the film by guiding us through it in a very deliberate way.
I guess I'll stop here.  Again, my advice, though I know it's hard to do, is to just watch the film with an open mind, not with a stubborn ""OK, let's see what's so great about this God damned movie"" attitude.  And think about it afterward.  Maybe even watch it (or parts of it) with the Ebert commentary.
Enjoy!",1002499200,,2208,4.507537688442211
802466,5,6304119046,"It makes me ill to read some of the negative reviews posted for this movie. A perfect example of the MTV generation more interested in action, gore and sex than a movie as poignant and profound as Citizen Kane.
Don't read this review thinking of some desiccated old reviewer who remembers ""the good old days"" of film making, as I am only a normal 22-year-old guy, and had only seen the movie for the first time yesterday. Then I saw it a second time later that night, and a third time this morning.
Boring? Slow? The time seemed to fly by watching the movie. With the cinematography better than any I've seen today, and with the intriguing story of an equally intriguing man who never finds what he needs the most in anything he did in his life filling your mind with possibilities of exactly what Rosebud is. A movie that makes you think 60 years after it was made. Then again, it is probably that fact that makes this movie such a turn off for the younger crowd. They don't want to think, all they want is a mind-numbing action-packed drug of a movie, if you will.
It pains me to imagine a persons mind so restricted to the point where any picture outside of what is ""normal"" sends their minds into a fit of rejection.
Was this the best movie of all time? I'll have to think about it. But it certainly ranks up there with the best I've seen.
In case you were wondering, I will buy this movie, and add it to my collection of DVD's, and it will be the first black and white movie I own. I'm a science fiction guy first and foremost, owning Independence Day, Men in Black, The Fifth Element, Fight Club, Gattaca, Dark City, The Abyss etc. I will make Citizen Kane a proud addition to them.
What is the one thing a man who has everything could never get back? If you can answer this question, you know the secret of what Rosebud is.
Don't criticize a movie just because you don't get it. People of small minds have a problem reaching beyond the trash put out by the studios today. Believe me, most of it is trash, I try to go to the movies once a week, and have yet to see a movie this year I will buy when it comes out on DVD.
Rent it, borrow it, buy it. Just watch it. You won't be disappointed.

By nature, any time something extremly subjective like a movie is ranked number one people are going to be divided.  Personally I don't think this is the best movie of all time, it's in the top five for sure but not the best.  That honor has to go to my all time favorite the Godfather but that story is for another review.
The movie Citizen Kane is a radical departure for most people.  Raised in the short attention span theater, alot of people don't have the patience to sit through this movie.  But for those who do, and are in the mood to think a bit, this movie is great.  When you first see it, on the surface their isn't much their.  It's a good story but why all the hype.  Well the impact of Citizen Kane actually hits you when you turn off the movie.  You sleep on it, or you do something else and the next day you start to think about it.  You realize that this is damn good cinematography, not just for 1941 but for 2001.  Their is a ton of great shots in the movie from when he drops the snow globe to when he takes a picture of the reporters he stole away.  You then begin to think about Rosebud.  Sure everyone already knew what Rosebud was, but why is it so important to a man who seemingly has everything, and yet nothing at the same time?  You also begin to see that for all his success, his failures far out weigh them.  All this stuff starts seeping into your mind and you suddenly realize the impact of this movie.  His unraveling at his failed attempt to make an opera star out of his wife, his failed attempt at running for governor all make you think.
  So for those of you who ""get"" Citizen Kane, you already knew these things, but for those of you who have seen it and don't like it, watch it again and like the quote at the end of American Beauty tells you, ""look closer.""",1002153600,,1884,4.186111111111111

But it is one that continues to mesmerize every time I run it, and I do think it lives up to its reputation.  Short of seeing a restored print on the big screen, this DVD version has to be the best way ever to see this film, in absolutely beautiful black and white.  If you have any doubts whatsoever about whether or not you'll like ""Citizen Kane"", at the very least give it a rental, preferably this DVD version.

Also included is the wonderful documentary ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"", which is a good, informative study of the lives of both Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst, and how their lives eventually collided over this film.

802582,5,6304119046,"This restoration of ""Citizen Kane"" is nothing short of miraculous, practically as dazzling an achievement as the film itself. It's pretty well known that the original 35mm print of ""Kane"" was lost long ago, so expectations of producing a superior duplicate from another duplicate were never very high. On the film's 50th anniversary, Turner Enterprises released a restored print for theatrical release, but though it was brighter, it had a somewhat white-washed, softy-focused aura that served neither Welles' purpose nor the ""film noir-ish"" properties of Welles' masterpiece adequately.
The DVD restoration, on the other hand, has crisp, sharply-defined images, richly complex and nuanced blacks, whites and greys, and an audio track that sounds fresh and ""present"" without over-equalization of highs and lows or gratuitous stereo simulation.
For some viewers, ""Kane"" ranks as the greatest film of all time because it's possible to stop the film on any single frame of its 2-hour length and produce an exegesis not only on the aesthetic and technical strengths of that individual shot but on the film as a whole, given its organic structure and the microcosmic status of each of the parts. For such viewers, this version should prove especially indispensable, affording glimpses of information--faces and other objects formerly covered by dark shadow, lap dissolves once too subtle to spot even in slow motion, competing, yet independently crucial, conversations--perhaps not accessible since the film's initial release.
Even without the bonuses, the single disc would be worth the price. But the inclusion of an additional DVD, ""The Making of Citizen Kane,"" along with the historical, biographical, contextual materials included on the first disc make this package a steal.  With this many riches to choose from, viewers may be excused if they pass up the Peter Bogdanovich running commentary on the film (I couldn't stay with it for very long), but Roger Ebert's extemporary ""play-by-play"" is not merely profuse but perceptive, articulate, and edifying from the very first shot. Even his commentary during the gallery of stills, in which he explains why ""Citizen Kane"" is his favorite movie and why it deserves its reputation as the best ever, is not to be missed. (I now realize that the hurried, superficial quality of much of his newpaper reviewing in recent years says more about the product than the reviewer.)
One caution: The first disc, with ""Kane"" and all of the assorted contextual material that follows, initially behaved ""buggy"" on my iMac DV.

This edition gives you three perspectives: Citizen Kane sans commentary, Citizen Kane with Peter Bogdanovich's commentary, and Citizen Kane with Roger Ebert's commentary.  Their commentaries are excellent.  Bogdanovich views Citizen Kane from a predominately psychological perspective, and Ebert views it from a cinematic perspective.  Their commentaries complement one another perfectly.  Disc 2 (The Battle Over Citizen Kane) explains the historical background of Citizen Kane.

In movie years, Citizen Kane is older than Moses. This makes its camera work and staging all the more remarkable. This is a brooding tour de force.
I invite all the people who have never seen it to sit back and drink in the imagery that Welles throws at the viewer. From the bright and clear images of Kane building his news empire to the distorted views of him being covered in a burial shroud...few have shown such mastery.
Cinematography is just the tip of the iceberg though. All of the visual appeal is used to convey a message about what is really important in life. Even if it does not become your favorite movie, this is a film that demands to be seen.

This is a film for the ages that one viewing cannot do justice. This isn't the kind of film you watch on the surface only, because no one thing in this movie has a single meaning. ""Rosebud"" is more than just a sled, or a lost childhood. The film says it best that no one word can describe a man, and that is what Citizan Kane was doing; describing a complicated man from different points of view. This is, indeed, the greatest film made.
  And on the DVD: The picture is outstanding! I've never seen this film look so good. And for film buffs, the feature commentaries by both Peter Bogdonavich and Roger Ebert are excellent and give you a whole new perspective on the film. The documentary that comes with it, Battle over Citizen Kane is haunting.
  This movie is a must-see and must-own for anyone who appreciates great filmmaking.",1001894400,6,1144,4.45933014354067
802589,5,6304119046,"The gorgeous new transfer of CITIZEN KANE on this DVD is much improved over that for the Criterion laserdisc version in 1991.  The picture is much cleaner; scratches, splices, and other blemishes have been cleaned up considerably.  Details in darker areas are much clearer.  For instance, in the scene where Charlie writes his declaration of principles while his head is in a shadow, on all previous transfers of the film that I saw, his head is in near total darkness; but on this DVD, his facial features are still clearly visible.  Another example is the scene where Charlie orders Susan to continue singing and his shadow totally engulfs her face.  On this DVD, you can distinctly see her facial expression in the shadow, while on older transfers, you cannot.  The improved details within shadows are crucial since much of Greg Toland's innovative photography makes elaborate uses of light and shadows -- shadows that are not just invisible black spaces, but with details, textures, and significance just like lit spaces.  Observant viewers will also notice on the improved DVD picture that, during the projection room scene, one of the people in the shadow is Joseph Cotten.  He is barely noticeable on old transfers, but very much so on this DVD.  (CITIZEN KANE is a rare film in which the actor who plays a main character also plays a cameo role in it!)  Also welcomed is that certain frames in the movie are displayed in ""windowboxed"" format (such as the huge headline ""Kane Marries 'Singer'""), ensuring that they can seen in full on certain monitors.
The audio transfer has not been neglected.  The mono sound is clear, sharp, and smooth.  Loud sounds are bright but not harsh.  Soft sounds are always audible.  The softest sound in the movie is probably the moment when Charlie says to Bernstein, ""Close the door,"" right after Susan's opera debut.  On old transfers it is barely audible, but much more so on this DVD.
There are 2 audio commentaries, one by Roger Ebert, who has done many shot-by-shot analyses of CITIZEN KANE and has deep knowledge about the film, and another one by Peter Bogdanovich, who knew Orson Welles personally and has deep knowledge about Welles's life and career.  Ebert's narration is livelier and covers more grounds.  He analyzes some of the themes in the story, and explains many innovative techniques used by the filmmakers, emphasizing that KANE is largely a ""special-effects"" picture.  Bogdanovich speaks subduedly and sparingly throughout (at one point he says there are other Welles pictures he likes more than KANE), but he makes many keen observations about Welles that can only come from someone who knew him well.  He says he once asked Welles why he did things so differently from other filmmakers.  Welles replied, ""I was like the guy who felt sick, and the doctor asked him what he did very morning.  And he said, ""Every morning I get up, then vomit..."".  The doctor asked, ""You VOMIT every morning?""  And the guy said, ""Doesn't EVERYONE?""  The guy thought what he did was normal.  And so did I.""
Other extras on the DVD include a one-minute newsreel footage of the film's New York premiere, the wonderfully-edited original theatrical trailer, and about 100 stills from the film's storyboards, production photos, press kit, and posters.  In the ""Still Gallery"" section, Roger Ebert speaks again on an 11-minute audio track about the significance of Welles' achievements in KANE.  There are two ""easter eggs"" (undocumented features) on the DVD as well.  One is on the main menu -- select the ""sled"" symbol and you will see a 6-minute interview of Ruth Warrick, who recalls her experience working with Welles.  Another ""sled"" symbol can be found in the ""Production Notes -- On the Set"" section where Robert Wise is mentioned.  Selecting it will take you to a 3-minute interview of Wise, who recounts a few anecdotes about KANE.
The second disc contains the excellent 2-hour documentary THE BATTLE OVER CITIZEN KANE, from 1996.  The disc is identical in content to an earlier DVD released by WGBH Boston Video.  The documentary provides vivid portrayals of Hearst and Welles, detail accounts of their rise to power, and fascinating details about the making of KANE and, of course, Hearst's attempts to destroy it.  The makers of the documentary went on to make the equally brilliant HBO movie RKO 281.",1001808000,5,4351,4.9326923076923075

Some people refuse to admit that besides spectacular technical effects, the story itself is enjoyable, and meaningful. I won't go into detail on that, though...
I'll just rave for a moment or two about the DVD, whith which I am thrilled. I love the commentary, I love the documentary, I love the photage, I love the media presentations. I miss only one thing: commentary by Welles himself, but some things are impossible, sadly. I think he would have been tickled pink to sit and talk about his baby, for two hours, to an adoring audience. :) Oh welle...
Warner Brothers, I commend you.
To anyone who is reading this and hasn't seen Citizen Kane, BUY THIS DVD IMMEDIATELY, AND HAVE IT OVERNIGHT MAILED, THEN POP IT IN THE MINUTE IT ARRIVES! If you are not amazed, and touched by this film, I'm truly sorry for you. You're missing out.
To anyone who is reading this, and has already seen Kane, well, you better than I what you think of it. If you liked it, do yourself a favor, and buy this superb DVD, and enjoy America's #1 Film of All Time as you've not seen it before. If you didn't like it, don't buy it. Spend your twenty-five bucks on Batman Forever, or Titanic, or some other 'modern' movie, with 'superior effects,' and more 'engaging characters,' and an ending with 'more kick'.
I wrote my Senior Report on Citizen Kane. I got a ninety-three. It was one of the lowest grades in the class, and it was one of the lowest grades I'd ever gotten in English (by far my best subject)... but I loved writing that report, and I wouldn't do a single thing differently. It's a magical movie, and this DVD does it justice.

802663,5,6304119046,"This is the DVD set that Kane (and most great films) deserve -- an excellent quality print with a very clear recording of its soundtrack. The DVD comes with about 30 index points, so it is very easy to find a particular scene.
If you haven't seen it, don't let the fact that Kane is considered to be a ""Great Film"" put you off.  Sure it is famous for all its innovations and clever techniques, but it really is a tremendous amount of fun to watch on its own.  The DVD lets you see a great print of the film, and its extra features (below) let you understand the interesting history behind the film and also some of the technical things that help to make it a ""Great Film.""
For me, the best extra feature of the DVD is a newly recorded running commentary by Roger Ebert who plainly loves Kane and really talks us through its many neat visual and sound effects.  Ebert gives us a lot of ""Now watch this..."" that really add to the enjoyment of the film.  There is also a second commentary by the director Peter Bogdanovich who was a good friend of Welles that gives of some sense of what Welles may have been thinking when he made different parts of the film.  Both sets of commentaries have the nice feature that you can hear the original movie underneath them so you know what the commentators are referring to.
In addition to the a disk of the film itself, this set has a second DVD that is a really good 2-hour 1996 documentary (seen on PBS) called ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane.""  The documentary presents the lives of Welles and newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst whose life is the thinly disguised subject for the film.  Both men led interesting lives, filled with ego and extragence.  The battle kept Kane from being shown widely and basically ruined the film career of Welles who became the ""youngest has been who ever was"" after Kane premiered (he was 26! or so).  There is lots of interesting file footage of Hearst and Welles, and interviews with those who knew them or have written about them.  For me, one of the engaging moments of the documentary come in an interview with the old Welles saying that he basically wasted his life after Kane -- he should have left films rather than spending 98 percent of his time hustling (his word) to try to get money for his film projects, many of which flopped.
This is a great set to have and is a definite buy.  Finally, at [this price], it is a real deal, especially given that the set contains the documentary as a second disk.",1001721600,7,2490,4.426695842450766
802664,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane, in my opinion and in the eyes of just about every legitamite film critic in America is one of, if not, THE greatest movie of all time. After viewing it I was so blown away I had to sit down for awhile and collect my thoughts. At no point in the movie is it boring unless you are one of those ignorant fools who thinks all black and white films are boring. Albeit, there isn't much action in Citizen Kane, but the characters make up for it ten fold with their realism. The ending of Citizen Kane is definatly one of the biggest surprizes in the history of filmmaking and makes watching the movie worthwhile. The plot was so important that forms of it are being used in big name Hollywood movies to this day. The film was extremely naive in its undertaking as it writes a biography of one of the richest and most influential people in American history ever and showed how imperfect the life of a supposedly ""perfect"" person is. This movie truly plays out like a dream. Don't listen to losers who tell you elsewise.",1001635200,,1026,4.37696335078534
802665,5,6304119046,"This is not a review of the movie ""Citizen Kane.""  I would not be so presumptuous to review or analyze a film about which volumes have been written and about which almost 250 viewers have already expressed their opinions on these pages.  Included with the DVD edition is a PBS documentary prepared about 4 years ago ""The Battle over Citizen Kane.""  It is on Disc 2.  It is only one on many documentaries that have been prepared about this film, but it, like many PBS documentaries, was very well done.  Unlike some other documentaries about Citizen Kane, it concentrates more on the two main protagonists - William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles.  It provides excellent biographies on both of these men, then discusses the battle to make this movie and the battle to prevent this movie from ever being seen.  There is very little information about the technical aspects of the movie -- the camera angles, sets, editing and sound.  It focuses on two of the biggest egos in the late 19th century and early 20th century America, thereby providing the viewer with a very compelling and thorough understanding of the controversy surrounding this movie. The documentary suggests what ""rosebud"" means (there have been mnany interpretations) and argues that Citizen Kane is as much an autobiography of Orson Welles as it ostensibly is a biography of Hearst.
If you have not seen this movie, or if you have already seen this film, or are seeing it again for the first time on DVD, or if, as some reviewers have opined, believe there was no plot to this movie or fell asleep while watching it (UNBELIEVABLE!!!), I strongly recommend that you watch the documentary first. This will provide you with a much better appreciation for Citizen Kane and also make the viewing much more enjoyable.",1001635200,,1780,4.832236842105263
802666,4,6304119046,"Now is your best chance to overcome your dislike for Citizen Kane. And if you already love the film you should be in hog Heaven.
 Citizen Kane is the story of a man taken out of his childhood at a young age who rises to greatness by creating a great newspaper empire to become one of the most powerful and influential men in the United States. He has friends, money love and an extravagant palatial estate called Xanadu high in the hills and above the world. Eventually all the treasures of his life become corrupted and lost by his own folly, jealousy and manipulations. This once powerful man lies in solitude longing for the things he lost in his life. He dies with one final word on his lips. ""Rosebud"" A reporter eager to make a story of the great man and decides his angle will be to decipher the meaning of this final word that is a mystery even to Kane's closest friends. It is through this reporter's investigation we learn the life of Charles Foster Kane.
 Very few people watching the film today have any personal recollection of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper mogul and yellow journalist upon whom the film is based. Nor are we much aware of the films being made at that time to give us a perspective on the many new innovations introduced by this film.
But most of us are familiar and comfortable with Roger Ebert who gives you a walkthrough on the film in one of the two commentary tracks. And there is a two hour documentary as well as scads of interviews and extras to make you expert enough at the film to pose at any Hollywood party as the boorish film snob you have always longed to be. And maybe if you are lucky you may even decide you like the film. If not there is still one bit of drama on the DVD you are sure to enjoy and that is the original Halloween broadcast of Orson Welles ""The War of the Worlds"". The radio broadcast that scared America and almost drove one woman to suicide.
 This DVD truly is a filmschool in a box and from what I can see, a pretty reasonable price for a double disc set. This film can help fans, non-fans and new viewers to appreciate this acclaimed film on new levels in a way never before available.",1001635200,,2162,4.346534653465347

Through it we see the life of one Charles Foster Kane analyzed: a man doomed by his own ambition, corrupted by power and with love only for himself. We see the creation of Kane's behemoth news empire and how it destructed. This is the single best character study I have ever seen, and it really defined the genre. This is a movie you can watch dozens of times and see something new every time, it is also a funny film (I laughed more than a few times), and such innovative storytelling and camerawork. The acting is excellent, and the score is perfect, not melodramatic, like many scores for older films, but entirely appropriate.

802670,4,6304119046,"I'm at the point of my life where I'm trying to re-watch movies that I might not have fully appreciated the first time around.  Some movies I have re-watched and still have the same conclusion (such as Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time In America;"" while I am much more of a Leone fan today than years ago, I still consider that my least favorite of his).  And then there is ""Citizen Kane,"" which I HATED with an absolute passion the first time I saw it many years ago.  Maybe it was because of all of the praise the film gets that jaded my feelings on it.  It could've been all the hate mail I got for giving a bad review of the movie.  Or, it could've been I was a dumb kid who didn't fully understand good filmmaking.

It was a little of all three, if you ask me.  Two years ago or so, I felt it was time to give Charles Foster Kane another shot, and now I can finally appreciate it for what it is.  Now, I can see why it gets all of the accolades it has received.  I wasn't a big fan of the story when I first saw it, and because of that it clouded my vision, not allowing me to see how brilliantly filmed it was.  Also, I didn't know the full history behind the movie, which I will get into later.

In short, ""Citizen Kane"" follows the life of newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane.  When he passes away, he utters one final phrase that has everybody wondering what he meant.  A reporter sets out to find out what it could possibly mean, and what he's presented is a portrait of a very complicated and sad life, no matter how successful Kane had become.

The star of the movie, understand, is not the writing--although now I have to say I like it more than I did back then.  The star of the film is the camera itself, presenting us very complex shots that had not been used before.  You can tell that this was Orson Welles' grand labor of love, and was willing to even give up everything in his life for it.  He would use a lot of weird camera angles that would tell the story rather than simply letting the camera face the actors.  Also, Orson gives one heck of a performance as ""Charles Foster Kane,"" completely absorbing himself into the role.

Also, another thing that really makes me appreciate the movie now more than ever is the FANTASTIC documentary on the second disk entitled, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane.""  I had no idea that this movie was inspired by a real person and because of that, Welles pretty much destroyed his film career with this very movie.  It's a must-watch if you really want to understand what it meant to Orson to have this film made.  That is what makes this Special Edition ""special,"" indeed.

So, I got rid of my old review of ""Citizen Kane.""  Why?  Because I grew up some and my feelings have changed.  It's not my top favorite film, but finally I can appreciate the love and labor that went into it.  Sometimes that happens to us.  There are films that takes years for us to finally appreciate.  I'm glad I took the trip again with mature eyes and appreciation for good filmmaking. - Michael Crane

The second disc that it comes with (The Battle over Citizen Kane) was great when we made copies of it for PBS at my work. It is a nice way to understand the whole film and the real-life results of the pseudo-life story of William Randolph Hearst. Citizen Kane also combines the urgency of needing to ""know"" about the keys to a man's life (i.e. 'Rosebud', etc.) as well as watching him rise to fame and then fall from grace. It is a film like no other that has since emerged from Hollywood, a true 5-star gem!

Welles and Mankiewicz prove Charlies self-destruction his self-loathing here. Its so subtle. Kane was terrified of finding his own history, roots, freedom, happiness. He sabotaged his self-discovery. He denied himself the childhood world of play (remember Thatcher's christmas gift of a sled?).

There are a lot of folks who will tell you this film ""sucks"" pretty much because of where it finished in some poll of snobs. They don't like snobs. So they trash the film. That's missing the point.
Some others try to outsnob the snobs, by making hyperarcane references to camera angles, cuts and lost films of the 1910s and 1920s. They miss the point too.

You don't need a PhD to see what kind of man Kane could be and the kind of man he becomes. However, if you DO happen to have a PhD, there's more intellectual meat the the bone of this film than many smart folks can digest in a lifetime.

And this...my persoanl favorite scenes are the great picnic scene on the beach with the music and the tents and all those black limousines, more suited to a funeral; and the scene of the wife, the Marion Davies character, sitting on the floor in front of a fireplace big enough to roast a rhinoceros, should one want to do such a thing, and doing yet another jigsaw puzzle and complaining that they never did anything or went anywhere...this, in a room of cavernous proportions, another reference to the fact that even San Simeon is not a guarantee of domestic bliss.

Some people say that it has too many flashbacks and is too confusing, (like the guy who wrote the reveiw that is a few slots under mine,) in my humble opinion these are the kind of people who have no pateince at all. People who want a movie to be as easy to understand as it could be. But the truth is, the best movies are ment to be figured out and thought about. Despit all the nay sayers who say that this movie wasn't as revolutionary as many say it is and those who just don't understand it, it is a wonderful, excellant movie.

This movie is great not just because of those things, or because it's about the fact that rich people can be just as lonely and hopeless as anyone (despite having lots of money). It's because it illustrates the theme so amazingly well with Welles' landmark portrayal of Charles Foster Kane. It is believable, which is the highest compliment anyone can pay to a job an actor does. You see Kane as a real person, and like the guys in the movie, you try to understand him - but you can't. Kane is a man who's desperate to be loved, but who himself is incapable of loving anyone. The result is that when he dies, there's utterly no one to remember him, and no one that has ever understood him - themes and images near and dear to my heart.
The reporters in the movie are trying to figure out what Kane meant with his dying words. In the process, they try to figure out Kane himself, but they fail, because no one was close enough to Kane to understand. Kane is a man who, despite having amassed unbelievable wealth, has wasted his entire life. He has no appreciation of art or culture or beauty even though he collects statues, builds opera houses, and marries beautiful women. His life is concentrated on ""getting stuff"" for no real reason. There's an amazing scene in the end where his wealth is just lying in piles and some workers just throw it in the fireplace (since no one wants to buy it). Everything is really expensive - finely crafted chairs, Oriental rugs, paintings - but there's so much of it and it's all in piles, so it looks like trash. And that's the point of the movie - the American Dream as it's commonly known is hollow.
Of course, all that would just be preaching if not for Welles' performance, which is outstanding, and creates a truly powerful film. I definitely recommend seeing it.",999302400,,1900,4.510144927536232

Best for its innovative cinematography (shot after shot have been copied by other filmmakers ever since), witty script, and superb acting - with Joseph Cotten, in my opinion, taking the honours from Welles himself on that score. But also best for being so incredibly entertaining while being self-consciously clever. There are lots of good jokes (including one famously rude in-joke*), and it's splendidly cynical about business and politics in a way that US films probably aren't allowed to do any more.
The DVD release does everything a DVD should: giving us a generous supply of outtakes, ""making of"" information that help you look at details (even now) with a fresh eye, discussions with the people who made the film, and some of the many critics who've carved themselves a living out of talking about it.
But in the end, I don't expect I'll watch all that other stuff very often. Maybe once more. In the end it's the film, _Citizen Kane_, in a format that beats the hell out of video, looking crisp and clear and sounding terrific, that makes this a worthwhile buy.
Cheers!

* ""Rosebud"" wasn't just a symbol of Kane's innocent, lost,childhood. It was also, out in the real world, a pet name that William Randolph Hearst used for, er, an intimate part of his lover's (Marion Davies) body. And though in public Welles insisted the film was not getting at any corrupt and powerful newspaper magnate in particular, that detail made it clear to Hearst that Welles meant Hearst, and he meant it _personally_. No wonder Hearst went out to destroy Welles. I might have been annoyed myself.",998956800,13,1738,4.777408637873754

802871,5,6304119046,"Reviewing this movie is like reviewing Shakespeare . . . what can I really say about it?
Orson Welles, a genius of the craft, portrays Kane in all of his emotions and all of his incarnations over the years.  I can just listen to his voice all day, even reading the ingredients to ice cream.  Watch for scenes where he limps, since he broke his leg during the filming of the movie.  And the scene where he goes postal in the room?  That was filmed with a broken leg.
The cinematography is eye candy.  Will all the advantages we have today, why aren't we resurrecting the angles and framing that Welles or Fritz Lang used?  All we are getting is rehash of the Matrix for the umpteenth time.  Can we return to beauty?  Or do we get glitzed by computer generated effects at the expense of art and story?
The story is a jigsaw puzzle, with each interviewee providing a piece.  But putting the perspectives together we get an external view of a man.  But externally, we just see what a man does.  We read his journals, and see what he thinks and feels.  But what is a man really???",997228800,,1075,4.32
802872,5,6304119046,"""Citizen Kane"" is often called the best film ever released, and today's audiences may find little in it to justify the legend that surrounds it.  That is not surprising given the generations that have grown up with ""Star Wars"" and ""The Godfather"" - certain contenders for the top spot.  To be sure, many films since ""Kane"" have made use of its novel editing and camera angles, and yes, many more flicks have aspired to its phenomenal staging and screenplay nuances.  But never before or since its release has any film captured the ESSENCE of filmmaking as ""Citizen Kane"" did, does and continues to do even 70 years after its release.
From its opening frame, to its flashbacks and Xanadu sequences, ""Citizen Kane"" created unforgettable images that remain with the film viewer for decades, if the viewer opens themselves up to Orson Welles' majestic point of view.  The tales of lost innocence, coupled with the lust for raw power and the tremendous symbolism of its sets, lightling, cinematography and editing are forever imbedded in cinema's short history.  I cannot say that another film won't one day capture all of these elements in such sure-fire ways.  But, as a film lover, I cfan say not a single film since its release has truly come close.
Is ""Citizen Kane"" the best film of all time?  Forget the critics, forget the hype and judge it for yourself.  If you remain open to what it has to say and bring with yuo a childlike innocence rather than a tired point of view, you will agree that ""Kane"" redefined cinema in its day, and continues to surprise today.  A brilliant film, an epic on the order of ""Ben Hur"" with the intimacy of ""All About Eve"" and the passion of ""Godfather,"" ""Kane"" will live forever!",997056000,10,1712,4.698996655518394
802873,4,6304119046,"Widely, and perhaps unfairly, recognized as the greatest movie ever made, Citizen Kane is undoubtably a landmark for its technological innovations.  Although both the story and the special effects do not come close to matching the best that is avialble today, in its time, Citizen Kane was a giant.  A lot of this has to do with the unique storytelling method of using flashbacks.  Virtually the whole story comes across as a reporter, in a futile attempt to discover the identity of the mysterious ""rosebud,"" makes a series of interviews.  One could argue that the non-chronological structure that results is a predicessor to movies such as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Memento.""  Another dramatic inovation in ""Citizen Kane"" is the dramatic use of lighting.  Legend has it that Orson Welles simply was unaware of the conventions at the time and simply ran around setting things up the way he felt they would be most effective with a team of bewildered technicians following him and correcting his minor flaws.  The end result of the effort is a film that looks totally different than anything that came before it both visually and scriptwise.  Although both of these advancements represent the kind of itellectual leap indicitive of genius, it is ridiculous to assume on these grounds that ""Citizen Kane"" is actually a better movie than something like ""Star Wars"" or ""The Godfather.""  Although neither of those movies might have been made without it, they have definately carried the baton to much greater heights than even ""Citizen Kane"" could have concieved.  Essentially ""Citizen Kane"" is a movie that is past its time.  The same thing will happen to ""Star Wars"" and ""The Godfather"" and every other movie ever made.  For those of you who appreciate involved, creative filmmaking, ""Citizen Kane"" will always be a masterpice with abundant characteristics to support its title as the greatest film ever made.  But if you are just a recreational movie fan, be wary of that claim because it is far more likely you will be much more emotionally engaged in a more modern film.",994723200,3,2065,4.968023255813954
802874,5,6304119046,"Orsen Welles is a genius.  You've probably heard that a million times, but what is it about this movie that can elevate a director to such status?  For starters, Welles was an innovator in such mundane fields as equipment and lighting.  He innovated numerous ways of lighting his set which allowed him to achieve shots with large depths of field or backlighting.  He also invented equipment which allowed him to achieve tracking shots that were unheard of before his time.  You follow the camera over a rooftop and then down through a skylight into a room where a conversation is taking place.  It seems pretty standard today, but you don't see that sort of thing in films before Welles came along. There is so much more, though.  What is the big deal about shot with large depth of field?  Examine the scene in which Kane's parents and the executor of his uncle's will are arguing over his future.  The shot contains four characters.  The banker, who wants to take Kane away.  Kane's mother, who wants him to stay.  Kane's father, who is undecided.  And Kane himself as a child who can be seen through the window playing with Rosebud.  The banker is positioned close to the camera, the mother is positioned by the window, and the father wanders back and forth in the shot.  The very positions of these characters illuminates where they stand on the issue being discussed.  The father is the most obvious example of this, as he wavers back and forth in his decision he wanders back and forth in the room, moving closer to the banker or closer to his wife by the window and his son playing innocently outside.  This is one example of how Welles utilized the large depth of field shot which he created especially for such scenes as this.  There are no cuts, no panning, just the room, mapped out on each end with a decision, and he plays the characters against this map. Then there is the ending.  Rosebud is the sled?  What does that mean?  It means that the search that the faceless men have been on is a wild goose chase.  How can one item in a man's life define who that man is?  It can't, as is reflected by the jigsaw puzzles that Kane's wife does, or the long tracking shot at the end which covers all the items in Kane's life.  It doesn't matter if Kane's last thought was of his boyhood and the sled he used to play with.  That does not discount every decision he has made throughout his life, it does not change any of the plans which he set into effect, or alter any of the lives he has ruined as he traveled through life becoming less and less like the young, adventurous noble man he started out as when he first comes into the newspaper office.  He may long for his distant childhood, but every step he took away from that life was a step he took by himself, and simply longing for the past does not absolve anyone of responsibility for the decisions they have made throughout their life.",994291200,6,2900,4.445075757575758
802875,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane has to be the most reviewed and discussd film of all time. Rather you are for it or against it one thing is certain the film can not be ignored. The plot is told in the opening credits through a newsreel flash forward after Kane's death, thus the information about the fims central character Charles Foster kane is established, the film then starts from Kane's early years of a child deprived of love to a wealthy newspaper tycoon adult void of a concious or a true ""love"" to call his own. But what makes kane an amazing film to watch is that it seems to be such an uninviting film to watch. Welles genius gives you this impossible figure for the viewer to empathize but as the film plays out you feel more than just disdain for the character but for the whole atmosphere of the film. Citizen Kane plays like a grown adults nightmare! Reality is twisted when the things in our adult life that we would love to own such as furs, diamonds and expensive homes are placed in Kane's lap and he not only loaths these material wishes but he buys nore and more of them as if one day they will magically fullfil the void he knows they can't fill. That is the magic and truth behind this flick Kane ultimately dies when all his materlistic needs are met and he suffocates in his need. Love, respect and happiness does pop into kanes life but when all is said and done the mere fact that Kane through out the entire film seems to relish the thoughts of wanteing to want makes Citizen Kane the most enjoyable film to dive into time and time again. And as for transition to DVD, the quality of the entire package is so well done and the picture so sharp you can actually count the whiskers on kane's face as he whispers his infamous dying words ""Rosebud""! The film also includes the Oscar Nomintated ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" it details to great acord the war between Welles and Hearst (Kane is supposedly based on Hearst). Welles paints Citizen Kane in stark lighting, haunghting music and beautifuly dizzing camera angles and the pristine transfer to DVD is simply amazing.",991353600,,2080,4.476315789473684
802876,5,6304119046,"Yes, it's true. CITIZEN KANE, like so many people have said countless times before, is my own inspiration to filmmaking; acting, directing, writing and producing my own future Oscar-winning epic masterpieces - PRISONER OF WAR, PRISONER OF WAR: PART II, PHILIP, KING OF SPAIN, and TRIANGLE. Although, I should say that CITIZEN KANE is one of many films that have inspired me, others include David Lean's trifecta of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and DOCTOR ZHIVAGO; GONE WITH THE WIND, SCHINDLER'S LIST, THE ENGLISH PATIENT, THE LAST EMPEROR, and SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. And, to a very lesser extent, I'll even say TITANIC and, maybe (though I hope not), the upcoming PEARL HARBOR. Though PRISONER OF WAR will be much more heartbreaking and moving without being melodramatic than either TITANIC and PEARL HARBOR! (Yes, there are a lot of impressionable films!) And soon, so will my films be legendary, critically-acclaimed, Oscar-winning, box-office smash-hit, epic classics.
Wow, that's a mouth full!
Back to CITIZEN KANE, a very inspirational film due to its groundbreaking techniques in camera angles (cinematography), dialogue, subject matter, shadows and lighting, and acting.
In 1941, Orson Welles, 26-years-old at the time, was given permission by RKO Radio to produce a film of his choosing. He decided to write a scandalous story loosely based on the life of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst and his mistress, actress Marion Davies. Controversial at the time because of the backlash that the film and Welles received when word got to Hearst of this picture depicting his life. Hearst tried many ways to get this film from ever being shown: He tried to buy the negatives from RKO in order to burn them; he tried to slam the film in all his newspaper, and even had Louella Parsons, a powerful critic at the time, slam the film in her columns. For more on this story, check out the 1999 film ""RKO 281.""
Welles, along with Herman Mankiewicz (brother of Oscar-winning director Joseph L. Mankiewicz), both collaborated in writing the script. Welles, who starred as the ""hero"" Charles Foster Kane, also acted as the director and producer, bringing in his Mercury Theater stage troupe from New York to fill in the parts for his film. They were: Joseph Cotten, as Kane's friend Jedediah Leland, the newspaper's drama critic; Everett Sloane as Kane's nerdy assistant, Mr. Bernstein; Agnes Moorehead, as Kane's mother Mrs. Mary Kane; Dorothy Comingore as Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander Kane; Ruth Warrick as Kane's first wife, Emily Norton Kane; Ray Collins as Kane's rival in politics, ""Boss"" Jim W. Gettys; Erskine Sanford as the befuddled Herbert Carter; Paul Stewart as Raymond the butler; and George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, the man who takes little Charlie from his mother and father, played by Harry Shannon.
It begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane with his final words ""Rosebud."" This meaning is the basis for the film, as a mystery, film-noir, and as a character study with little bits of comedy in it (supplied by Erskine Sanford's character). The film is basically told in flashback, going from his childhood in 1878 to his death in 1941. Revered as America's own Kublai Khan, living in seclusion in his castle Xanadu, which was taken from Hearst's own real-life private castle - San Simeon. We learn of Kane's rise to power, as a simple newspaper owner to a political-hopeful man, to his downfall when he is disovered to have an affair with a struggling singer, who eventually becomes his second wife. More sad news, his first wife, Emily, and son Charles III, were killed in an auto accident. Told by his friends, Jed Leland and Mr. Bernstein, and by his second wife, the shadowed figure of a man named Jerry Thompson (William Alland) uncovers each secret that reveals some truth to the myth of Charles Foster Kane.
In the end, we find out what ""Rosebud"" meant. His sled, which was prominent in the beginning, was a reminder of his lost childhood. He never wanted the money, only love! But, according to Leland, he wanted ""love on his own terms,"" which sadly costed him in the end. Truly thought-provoking and moving!
At the Academy Awards, Orson Welles received 4 personal nominations from CITIZEN KANE's 9 noms in 1941 for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Screenplay (with Herman Mmankiewicz), and Best Picture. The only award the film received was the Best Screenplay Oscar!
From the haunting score by Bernard Herrmann to the shadowy photography by Gregg Toland to the fast-paced editing by future Oscar-winning director Robert Wise (WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC), CITIZEN KANE proved to be a film way ahead of its time; as well as a film that could stand among the very best!
Orson Welles's debut proved to be his most powerful and influential.",990403200,,4813,4.972704714640199
802877,3,6304119046,"I rented the film based on the strength of the reviews.  In my opinion, it is a good film but no masterpiece.  One thing about the picture which I found very annoying was the loud blairing circus music when cutting to different scenes.  I wouldn't have rented this movie if I were an MTV junkie.  I appreciate good movies (old and new) but Citizen Kane is not worth buying; rent it instead.
One of the qualities of a good movie is that it stays in your mind long after you've seen it.  Citizen Kane doesn't have this lasting effect.  The main character never seems to do any introspection and it was not made clear how he died.  The main character does come to a point in his life where he becomes disillusioned and that (I think) is when he says ""Rosebud"" then drops the glass ball on the floor.  I have my own theory on what Rosebud meant but I'd rather not spoil the picture.  I'll give you a hint, it's similar to Lester Burham's red pontiac firebird in ""American Beauty"".  Anyway, I think it should have been made clear what he meant by rosebud.",990230400,2,1050,4.338461538461538
802918,5,6304119046,"I think there has been a recent backlash over 'Citizen Kane' because it is frequently voted the 'greatest film ever made' by movie critics and movie buffs.  Many people are rebelling against this idea because they feel otherwise.  What they don't realize is how silly it is to call any one single film 'the greatest' ever made.  Regardless of how one feels about Orsen Welles' masterwork, there is not doubt that his movie is at least one of the most important and influential films ever created.  It revolutionized they way movies are made; it has groundbreaking originality in camera angles, flashback sequences, screenplay, metaphors and acting.  'Citizen Kane' has one unforgettable sequence after another; it has one of the most haunting openings and hair-raising endings to any film I've ever seen.  It is one of those rare movies that many people could never forget throughout their lifetime.  If I had only seen it once, I still would have been able to remember it sixty years later.  There is no doubt in my mind.

No for the double DVD..  'The Battle over Citizen Kane' is just as fascinating as the film itself.  It shows how the career of Orsen Wells was ruined just for making a movie.  He was dealing with people who were much more powerful then he realized.  Some free country we live in, right?  Roger Ebert gives his usual wise and intelligent commentary about the film.  I think he might be the only living critic who has discussed 'Citizen Kane' more than anyone else.  He should keep on discussing because it is a timeless work of art.",990057600,,1555,4.724907063197026

ALSO, based on the reviews, I thought this would be a great film.  It fails miserably. Charles Foster Kane's belligerent, aggressive, superior and obnoxious attitude lacks sympathy and, as a protagonist, he elicts little pity.

What really made this movie great was the ending. I won't tell you the ending, as that would hopelessly ruin your pleasure of seeing it. Speaking of the ending, it has got to be one of the most powerful endings that I've seen--but you have to be patient. Everything from the dialogue to the camera angle, EVERYTHING is PERFECT in that ending. Some people say how the ending in the Sixth Sense was good, but the Sixth Sense is NOTHING compared to the ending in this movie. But the movie's basic message is this: The most significant things in life are things that are seemingly insignificant. One reason why this movie is so powerful is because it was based on a real person. Most of us knew or now know that this movie is modeled after the life of William Randolph Hearst. They say that this movie is the best movie of the century, but this is one of those movies where if you deleted the ending or changed it in any way, it would go from a five star movie to a three star movie or less, really quick. Yes, this movie is very slow, something you could only bear to watch maybe once a year or two, if that. Sometimes once is enough. If you haven't seen it, give it a try. Don't expect some sing-song, happy happy joy joy 40's movie with Fred Astaire. Nope. This movie is very dark and haunting, but very powerful. See it at once.",985564800,,1503,4.3144876325088335
802922,3,6304119046,"I think this movie was super technologically speaking, however the plot left little to be desired.  Kane had a very complex inner struggle going on inside him that takes a little thought to fully understand.  While Kane was very young (8, I think) his mother sent him out west with a very large inheritance comming in the future.  It was during this scene that the father gets angry with Charles and says he needs a whippin'.  I think this is the most important scene in the entire movie because it tells so much of Charles' life until this point.  We all know that the early years of a childs' development means so much, it literally can predetermine a childs life.  It was very evident that Charles had an abusive father.  The mother even says she is sending him away, ""...so you [dad] can not hurt him.""  His father gave him very little, if any love at all.  At the same time, his mother is giving him away.  I have no idea how Charles took this, but nevertheless, he was never able to fully ""experience a mothers love.""  I think a child needs a life-time of loving, and even then, still longs to be loved more.  Charles had no control of his mother sending him away, which I think accounts for his obsessive urge to control everything around him, including his wives.  Their leaving makes his inner struggle even more complex.  Now, I think I'll bring in a little of the technologigal side of the film here because it adds so much to this theme.  Notice that when Charles' mother is signing him away he is dwarfed by the camera.  Then when his second wife leaves him, he is pictured larger than life.  In both instances, he has no control.  Because the film centers around Kane's last word ""Rosebud,"" perhaps this theme is often overlooked.  In reality the sled symbolizes little, it is only necessary for one-time, lazy viewers.  Those who watch a film and do not search any deeper than what is told and shown to them on the screen.  In my opinion if they had never revealed what the rosebud meant, I would have been just as satisfied with the film.  Much more could be said about the film and all other elements of it, so I look foreward to reading all future reviews.",985219200,2,2174,4.450632911392405

Orsen Welles changed the way movies were made with Citizen Kane by introducing many new camera angles and techniques and with its story structure. Unfortunatley, appreciation for Citizen Kane usually comes only from movie critics and movie buffs and is dismissed by others as `boring'. Admittedly, Citizen Kane is a very deep movie and it may require 2 or 3 viewings to fully understand it and to appreciate it for the masterpiece that it is.
There are a number of aspects that make Citizen Kane a classic and a landmark for movie making. The use of camera techniques and angles that Orsen Welles introduced are outstanding. The camerawork in Citizen Kane is outstanding even by today's standards.
Then there is the script. Written in such a way that it flows, never looses its way and always keeps you hanging onto every word. It really is one of the greatest scripts ever written.
Then of course, there are the themes in Citizen Kane. One is the fact that Kane wants to be loved but doesn't know how to love. Another is the message that riches don't bring you happiness. Charles Foster Kane was a man who had everything yet only really valued 'Rosebud'. Also, Kane was very high in terms of social status and knew a lot of people, yet he was still lonely.
Citizen Kane is one of those movies that can be watched over and over again and is just as good everytime. It never seems to lose its interest and has stood the test of time.

Realize, folks, that Welles was only in his mid-twenties when he made this picture. Then go and watch him play a man who ages 50 years in the course of the film.

He then sought love from people through money. Not having really been loved, he could not give it. ""Rosebud"" represented  the last thing that he held onto from his childhood. Both my mother and I were astonished to see how this pattern was repeated over and over again. Especially from Jed Leland and Susan Alexander's accounts. This is a  ""must see"" film.

Based largely on the life of media mogul William Randolph Hearst, this has all the elements of a great movie.  The story of Charles Foster Kane is given to us at the beginning of the film in a sort of parody of the newsreels common in that day.  This is to be the bare bones of all the disjointed scenes of his life.  With each retelling of parts of his life, we are treated to more layers and understanding.
Charles Foster Kane began his life quite poor and the son of a sometimes abusive, sometimes loving father.  His mother, when she comes into a large amount of money, makes the ultimate sacrifice and sends him away from the father who, she believes will harm her son.  This is a good time to mention Agnes Moorehead's portrayal of Kane's mother.  It is intricately done and fascinating to watch.  What might have been considered a heartless character in that she sends her only child away is actually a heart wrenching moment in which a loving mother does the only thing she can do.  She tries to give her son a better life.  Kane eventually makes for himself a huge empire starting with the Inquirer, the first newspaper he gained control of on a whim.
Another brilliant stroke intended to keep us enthralled is the storyline that threads throughout the film.  A reporter, Thompson, tries to find out the meaning of Kane's dying word, ""rosebud.""  Throughout all his meetings with Kane's former friends he never finds its meaning.  ""I don't think any word can describe a man's life.""  This is certainly the case in this movie, when a man changes from freshly idealistic to bitter with impotent rage.  He goes from having control over his entire world to watching helplessly as his wife leaves him.
Many scenes in the film are visually stunning.  Xanadu, the unfinished and yet decaying mansion represents Kane's life.  Though he is capable of so much more, he dies without accomplishing it all.  Kane and Susan, together in the hall of Xanadu are viewed far apart, representing more than their physical distance from one another.  A device used often in this film is the long shot in which all objects in the shot are in focus.  In many of them, Kane is made to appear larger than life, dwarfing other characters in the scene.  Although in some scenes, such as when his mother is literally signing him away, he is seen blissfully ignorant, playing in the snow outside...an almost invisible figure.  In addition, when he is signing many of his holdings away, it is he that is dwarfed by the large window above him.  These different perceptions of his size are used skillfully to inform us of his current status in life.
The theme that has the most impact for me is the idea that, all his life, Kane wanted only for people to love him.  His problem was that he could not love in return.  We are all afraid of being hurt this way.  How many times have we wanted love without the risk of letting our own hearts in on it?  It is terrifying to think that we could lose these chances just as Charles Foster Kane does.
This film, infinitely complex, is rightly considered to be one of the best American films of all time.  Its layers and mystery will keep viewers enthralled for years to come.",979689600,2,3279,4.530612244897959
803006,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane has been considered one of the best movies to come out of the black and white era, much less of all time.  It also is probably the top of Orson Well's movie career.
The movie starts off with a distant fog haunting over the famed gothic castle, ""Xanadu"".  Moving past fences, and gates it goes to show how private and closed the star of the show, Charles Foster Kane, really is.  Moving toward the castle you get a glimpse of Mr. Kane.  Then you see him take his last breath and mumble the famous word, ""Rosebud"".  This word is then the basis of the whole movie.
It then jumps to a newsroom, with a crew watching a documentary on Kane.  They feel like something is missing from it that would give it the edge it needed.  They then thought that if they knew what this ""Rosebud"" meant that possibly they could get the upper hand on the news and make some serious money.  So the case is afoot.
Soon a reporter is going all over the country, talking to friends, family, and ex-employees to possibly get a hint of what this ""rosebud"" is.
The film is made with multiple flashbacks that are introduced by the men and women that the reporter is interviewing.  Going back to his childhood and how he ended up in the money, all the way until his political career is destroyed by a careless affair, and ending with his wife leaving him.
Kane's life is filled with highs and lows.  Disappointments have made him hard, and good times give him an arrogance that made his role in the film very eye appealing.  I felt that this movie was extremely well done.  It caught my attention from start to finish.  It was put together in such a way that it left people wanting to know even more about this fictitious, larger than life character.
I don't know if one can say enough about this movie.  It was in black and white, which usually kind of bothers me, but I thought it really helped add the necessary film fundamentals that encompass the viewer to the point of questioning ones reality.
This film, though fiction is also a semi-direct representation of a real life character.  William Randolph Hearst was a man living in same time as the movie came out.  He was greatly offended by the similarities portrayed in the movie.  Though Hearst tried to use his power to get ""Kane"" out of the theatres before it started, he failed.  But the after shocks of Hearst's outrage hit Welles' career hard.  The film was up for nine Academy Awards, but only receive one.  And after ""Kane"" there was a gradual downfall in Welles career up until he died in 1985.
I thought this movie was great.  I don't always like old movies, but this one was superb.  I hope all of you feel the same way.  Please, check it out, you won't be disappointed.

803008,5,6304119046,"Citizen Kane is considered by many, with Casablanca, to be the best American movie in history. Although I am not an avid movie-goer or a film buff, I can't disagree with that appreciation. It is certainly the greatest movie I have ever seen.
Despite being in b/w, Welles' use of light and camera angles is nothing short of stunning, esp. the group scene after the first newsreel. One little problem, though : I don't know if it's because of this recording in particular, but the sound volume grows terribly loud as the movie progresses, so keep your remote in hand.
But the most incredible aspect of this movie is without a doubt the story. We follow the quest of a journalist as he is assigned to find out the meaning behind Charles Kane's dying word : ""rosebud"". The journalist goes to talk to many people who knew Kane during his life, and gives rise to numerous flashbacks of their contacts with Kane.
Despite his never-ending wealth and ambition, Charles Foster Kane is a complex and tortured man. He runs a newspaper empire, attempts to run for governor, and erects a gargantuan castle called ""Xanadu"", where he cannot find peace. His apparent paradoxal nature is explained when we understand that what he seeks is love, but on his own terms. He seeks what he does not have.
This movie is powerful and asks pointed questions about, for example, the difference between egoism and self-centeredness, and how this affects our view of the world. This is, in a good sense, a very spiritual and involving movie.",977702400,11,1511,4.7272727272727275

I just have to say a couple things about it, besides the fact that it is the greatest film ever made and it's perfect in every way, because we all know that.  I have a message for all the viewers...if you watch this movie and expect something entertaining then, you should just not watch this film at all...it is not meant to be entertaining.  It is like a work of art.  ""CITIZEN KANE"" is like Piscasso's Old Guitarist painting...it's not exactly the happiest most entertaining painting in the world but...IT'S GOOD!  This movie is one you don't just go to Blockbuster and pick up for a good Saturday night movie..NO NO! It is a film which needs to be studied ahead of time, watched very carefully, and probed into. This is a film which calls for the human mind to function on a higher level...much higher than the normal standard of thinking.  The camera shots- we know they are beautifully mapped out and have such an artistic value to them that you could take almost any still from this movie and hang it in a art museum! You need understand this movie...study each character...especially Kane...the title of the movie is ""Citizen Kane"" because underneath all that money, power, greed, and corruption- he is just a citizen, like you and me.  So, I suggest to anyone who wants to see this movie to ask someone about it...who has studied it before...ask them to explain it...My dad helped me alot in the understanding of this movie, as he does with many movies.  Once you understand this movie, it becomes MORE than a movie...it helps you understand all movies...and how character is crucial to plot, and how the camera angles and lighting is what makes a movie different from a play....it adds an artistic element to a motion picture that you cannot acheive in a play..and Orson Welles understands this, for he is the most important and brilliant film director to ever grace the screen with one of his films.  This picture single-handedly rises above all other pictures as a masterpiece of film...and it will remain that way forever because Welles is the Shakespeare of the motion picture, and just as there will never be another William Shakespeare, there will never be another Orson Welles.",977270400,9,2248,4.702290076335878

One of the things it could be designed to be is a big message, a headline in one of Kanes newspapers even. The headline reads: America is powerful, and power corrupts. Kane could represent America, a country that was given great power, from another. The country hoped to enlighten those of the underprivileged and bring liberty to all. The country hoped to have fun and was innocent and nice to all the other countries. As America became more and more powerful though, it began to  care only about itself. America now foolishly views itself as the greatest nation of them all now. America thinks that it can control everything, and forced the other countries to love itself, two of them are Russia and Vietnam. When these countries do not agree to love him, we retreat to our material world and die cold and lonely, forgetting Americas youth of love and happiness. I know im starting to ramble, but the point is, Citizen Kane has not one message or theme, but many. It's a brilliant movie that shouldn't be watched because its entertaining or dramatic or whatever, It should be watched because it's art. I would even argue that if you classified Citizen Kane under one genre it would have to be a comedy, with the joke on America, and our sick twisted ways of valuing money and material over anything else.",975715200,3,1386,4.703703703703703

Except for one thing...in any review of a classic film, or any film for that matter, you cannot simply cast aside the 'special effects' or any other aspect of the film.  To say that all that is secondary and that only the story is important is ludicrous.  The camera work, the directing, the cinematography, the performances, the writing, all of these are essential parts of the story, and Wells is a master.  The use of circular narrative, the deep-frame focusing, the high and low camera angles, the use of light and shadow(you only have to look at Conrad Hall's work in American Beauty, to see Kane's impact).  This is a master work because every aspect of the production works together, not because the story is good.

Beranrd Hermann, who also contributed music for Alfred Hitchcock movies (particularly Psycho) and the Twilight Zone TV series, does an excellent job with the score.  For me, the most interesting part of Citizen Kane is seeing the kind of person Charles Foster Kane (Welles) was to others (he is seen as an egomaniac, shallow, lonely, private, and mysterious by each of them).  Nobody knows the real Kane in the end, not even the viewer.

 Time and time again Welles tempts fate, risking disaster to create masterpieces. Star of stage and radio, film with its limitless possibilities (and Hollywood with its machinations) prove his undoing.

Citizen Kane, more than any other film that I am aware of, lets us into the most inner reaches of the soul of the main character.  The ... review of this film sums up the conclusion of this film as ""...people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily"".  But that's not true - Charles Foster Kane is a remarkably simple man, whose whole life has been a fruitless search for one thing - unconditional love.
I've known people like this--wealthy, influential, who seemingly have it all.  The problem here is that everyone wants something from them.  They are loved, but conditionally.  Pay their salary, and people will love you.  Stand up for their rights, and people will love you.
Imagine being 8 years old and sent away by your mother, the one person you were sure loved you unconditionally, never to see her again.  And on top of that, you are one of the richest people on the face of the earth.  How could you ever be sure again that anyone loved you for yourself?  This movie is the story of that unsuccessful search for unconditional love, and the longing for Rosebud, the symbol of the last time Kane experienced it.
Citizen Kane is known to have been based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, but I doubt Orson Welles had ever met the man prior to making this film.  He must have known well someone similar to Kane to so thouroughly understand how a wealthy and powerful person can be, deep down, so insecure.",971049600,6,1637,4.459731543624161

Plainly put, Orson Welles' masterpiece is both an exquisitely crafted work of cinematic genius, and a fun movie to watch.  Zippily edited, stirringly scored, brilliantly acted, peppily written, KANE is a movie I can go back to again and again, both for its delicate subtleties and for its sheer entertainment value.
Okay, if you're the sort of film watcher who can't stand anything in black and white or (like someone whose name I won't mention) doesn't like to see films made before you were born, there's nothing to be done for you.

Just about every body is disturbed to some degree by this film. Why? Because Welles cuts to the  very center of what is to be a human being. No one, I think, starts out  with the premise  ""I'm going to be a bad person"". Kane, is propelled in the  beginning by a need to do good and gets done in the end by his obsessive  desire for power, wealth, material goods, control, love and adulation.  Shaped by events in his early childhood he is incapable of giving or  receiving  love.  In this respect, Orson Welles, has created a tragedy in  the classic tradition of the Greeks or of Shakespeare. Charles Foster Kane  is specify symbolic for each of us as individuals and in general for an  American society, where we have more and more of everything material and  less and less of  the humanity and love which makes a civilization great.

This film worked magic for me at one time, and still could  again if I were in the right mood.  The key, to me, is the sound and the  music.  Bernard Herrmann's score evokes feelings that are unique, that no  other movie score that I've heard comes close to.  This has little to do  with its intrinsic qualities as music.  It has everything to do with the  context in which the music is heard:  what's on the screen, what else is  being heard, where we've been in the story and where we're going. I'll give  one example.  After the long, soul-grinding Leland segment we cut to the  outside of Susan Alexander's nightclub.  The weather is calm (unlike the  first visit to the nightclub which took place during a thunderstorm) but  there is a chastened, morning-after-a-storm feeling.  In order to feel  this, we need to have already experienced: a) Susan Alexander's anger  during the first visit  b) the thunderstorms during the first visit c) the  later thunderstorm during the Bernstein segment d) the emotional  meat-grinder of the Leland segment. Both the characters and us have been  softened up by what's come before, but it is the music at this moment, a  quiet back-and-forth figure in the winds, that draws all these threads  together to express something for which the best phrase I can come up with  is ""a feeling of being chastened by life.""",963705600,,1505,4.706563706563706

803172,5,6304119046,"Probably the most unfortunate thing that ever happened to `Citizen Kane' was that it found itself atop the AFI top film list.  Now, no one can simply enjoy the film.  Everyone feels compelled to scrutinize it and make  a decision about its greatness.  Asking whether `Citizen Kane' is the best  film of the century is like asking if Marilyn Monroe was the most beautiful  woman.  It depends on whom you ask.
`Citizen Kane' is not the most  entertaining film I've ever seen, but it is certainly one of the most  important.  It is a vanguard motion picture and a gargantuan achievement  for Orson Welles.  If you consider the fact that Welles was a 24 year old  Hollywood outsider who had only done radio and theater when he landed the  contract for this film, you begin to appreciate what a big deal it was.  This was during a time when a few studios controlled every film that was  made. How many 24 year old actor/directors can you name today, even in a  world where independents abound?
The story is based on the life of  William Randolph Hearst.  Writer Herman Mankiewicz had an up-close look at  Hearst as he had been an occasional house guest at the Hearst mansion.  The  similarities were striking, right down to the paramour whose career Hearst  promoted, who loved to do jigsaw puzzles.  The fact that this film was  released at all is a marvel in itself.  Hearst went on a personal campaign  to crush the film and enlisted every powerful friend he had to stop it.  Louis B. Mayer offered RKO $800,000 to destroy the print.  John D.  Rockefeller ordered the Radio City premier cancelled.  All of Hearst's  newspapers were forbidden to mention the film.
Hollywood was uniformly  against it and Welles was branded an insolent maverick.  The film was  snubbed by the Academy.  It was nominated for 9 Oscars and won only best  screenplay.  The film turned out to be a commercial failure, losing  $150,000.  With all the forces stacked against it, we are lucky to be  having this best film debate at all.
The story has a simple moral; that  money and power can't buy happiness.  We see Kane's progress from a happy  child, to an idealistic young journalist intent on helping the common man,  and finally to a bitter and angry old man whose innocence has slipped from  him.  One of the most effective scenes that illustrated this was the two  minute overlay of breakfast conversations with his wife.  It starts with  cooing lovers and progresses through increasing levels of discord.  It ends  in silence with the two reading separate newspapers, her disdain for him  subtly indicated by her choice of the hated Chronicle as her  newspaper.
What is so remarkable about this film is the filmmaking.  Director after director has pointed to some aspect of this film as having  influenced them.  The use of shadows and various perspective shots was not  unprecedented in 1941, but never before had they been used with so much  dramatic impact.  What was unprecedented was that `Citizen Kane' was the  first film ever to depart from the strict narrative format, which moves  forward chronologically.  The film starts at the end and jumps around in  time based upon the perspective of the person who is telling his or her  story about Kane.  So the next time you see a flashback, remember it  started here.
The makeup was revolutionary.  Welles often went through  four hours or more of makeup to be properly aged for each scene.  The film  also launched a number of brilliant careers.  Besides Welles, Joseph Cotton  and Agnes Moorehead went on to long and prominent film careers.
If  `Citizen Kane' is not the best film of the century it is certainly one of  them.  Its influence on a generation of filmmakers cannot be ignored in the  equation.  People who watch this film and ask, ""What's the big deal?"" are  comparing it with modern films that have borrowed from this film's  techniques and undergone 60 years of evolution.  It's like going back to  Kitty Hawk and saying, ""What's the big deal, the flight only lasted a few  seconds.""
There is only one rating to give to a film of such monumental  importance.  It is the consummate 10.",960163200,825,4136,4.707042253521127

803287,4,6304119046,"I saw this old classic produced by the extremely young Orson Welles (who was also famous for causing a big Mars-invasion scare back in 1938) in my film class years ago. Though I sluggishly waded through this seemingly  meaningless film, I was nevertheless quite impressed by the incredibly  elegant mansion that Mr. Kane once lived in. And then later on, I read the  script all about this movie. Thus I truly understood its contents as well  as the protrayal of the real-life William Rudolph Hearst behind it. In  addition, this old film was supposed to be a revolutionary of its time,  when very simple props were efficiently used to create utterly believable  settings as well as to tell a believable story about a certain gentleman of  the early 20th century.
This story all begun with an innocent little boy  playing on his sled in the snow during the 1870s or so as his stern-looking  mother patiently looked on. Then he grew up to become a newspaper emperor  and married a wife at the turn of the century, yet suffered from a very  loveless marriage. So he then courted a very pretty young girl who wanted  to be an opera singer, yet she simply did not prossess such talent or  skills. But Mr. Kane used his great influence and wealth to promote the  naive little girl into a very gaudy role complete with a real operahouse  and all. Unfortunately, the whole audience suffered from her terrible  voice, yet could not say anything about it lest they rouse the great Kane's  wrath. In addition, Mr. Kane built a very fancy palace for his young  mistress, who eventually could not stand his suffocating arrogance. So in  the very end, she simply packed up and walked right out, thus the very  furious old man really ripped up her room, destroying everything in  sight,...but the little old snowglobe that suddenly sent a nostalgic shard  right through his heart: a miniature setting of his childhood home. So - he  cried out the famous word, ""Rosebud"" before finally passing away.  A very sad picture of a proud but unhappy man.
Though there are indeed  many viewers who may not get this old movie at all, yet it did inspire a  great deal on the future generations yet to come as well as the famous  painting, ""Scream"" does. For instance, Matt Groening, the creator  of ""The Simpsons"" makes a great many references to ""Citizen  Kane"" especially with Mr. Burns, the overaged, superrich old boss at  Homer Simpson's work. Now this is a good example of why this old flick  straight out of the WWII period continues to be one of the most acclaimed  movies of the 20th century.",959558400,,2575,4.651111111111111

American pop  culture is fascinated by digitized action scenes and computerized special  effects.  I personally love them as well.  But this movie is truly ahead of  its time.  I know this has been said hundreds of times, but the camera  angles and innovative filming were truly astonishing, especially for the  time period.  I loved the way Welles showed weaker characters looking up at  the camera, while stronger characters (such as Kane himself) looked down at  the camera.

However, I was in doubt, in fact, I  almost skipped the night we watched it.  I'm so glad I didn't.  Orson  Welles techniques in this film are so unlike any others used in movies at  the time.  His editing choices are wonderful, and I found the story to be  very interesting.  In the story, you follow the man from his childhood, to  his death.  We see a man who has all the material belongings in the world,  but is never happy.  I found the story to be entertaining, and the filmwork  magnificent.

803291,5,6304119046,"With all due respect for the reviewer from New York (April 11, 2000) who found Citizen Kane boring, may I suggest a flickering white light, that sits two inches away from your eyeballs.  This will stimulate the nerves in  your retina that have obviously been deadened by episodes of ""the  worlds greatest car chases.""  Although you may wish to rather view the  nightly news for more relevant stimuli, the notion that the  ""Rosebud"" plot of Citizen Kane is boring and been done, is well  taken.  However, I must confess igonorance to the subject.  Might this poor  player of a movie, be an original or dare I venture, an innovator of such a  genre?  While someone might indeed be able to find such filmmaking  techniques in ""A complete Idiots Guide to Filmmaking"" as you  suggest, I wonder whether those classic books were available at that time,  and why no modern filmmaker has seen fit to read them, as is evidenced by  the poorly shot, and poor plot films we are subject to today.  I saw  Citizen Kane recently, and though dissapointed there were no visable  explosions or gratuitous violence, was entertained to the point of thought  and retrospection.  The story in the film was not a special effect (a  departure I found unnerving) but rather a person, and the circumstance of  fame.  The filmmaking you mention as simple, did look pedestrian compared  to the computer graphics we see today, and one can only wonder why they  were once described as revolutionary.  I mean we see those shots in film  all the time today, so what was so special?  Despite it's obvious flaws,  the film remains probably the greatest ever.  It's just a shame, they  didn't have computer generation technology back then.  It would've made the  story of remembering one's innocence that much more compelling.  Maybe with  a character like Jar Jar, I would've felt his pain.  As the reviewer from  New York rightly states, this whole Rosebudgate has been done with better  flair with Watergate, Irangate, and Monicagate.  I mean, couldn't Mr.  Welles have learned from the sensationalism of the Watergate affair to make  a better movie?  I guess we will never know.

803416,4,6304119046,"""Citizen Kane"" is often hailed as one of the greatest, or even the best, film ever made.  The main thing that makes this film a classic are the innovative lighting and camera shots (thanks to Gregg Toland,  director of photography), very expressionistic in outlook, that are  reminiscent of German silent classics such as ""The Cabinet of Dr.  Caligari"" or ""Nosferatu"".  The scenario has lost some of its  meaning over time, for not that many people know on whom the character of  Kane is based (media magnate William Randolph Hearst).  The scenario by  Herman Mankiewicz was written as a parody of Hearst, which explains why the  latter tried to have the film banned and, when this failed, to give it bad  reviews in his newspapers in order to make the film a commercial failure.  Even though the real meaning of the film has been lost over time, it still  enjoys popularity because of the cinematographic innovations it contains.  The script, however, has several flaws.  The entire story revolves around a  reporter's attempt to find the meaning of Kane's last word before his  death, ""Rosebud"".  Yet there was nobody in sight when Kane  uttered his last word.  In general, however, this film deserves to be  called a true classic.",950486400,9,1233,4.859903381642512
803417,4,6304119046,"The first time I saw this, it really didn't make an impression.  I reacted indiffrently, with no real opinion one way or the other.  The second time, it made a stronger impression.
I'll try to simplify the dense, complex  plot by saying it's basically about a man who tries very hard to be good,  (I think), even though everyone keeps telling him how bad he is.  He tries  to build a newspaper empire and succeeds, becoming a Hearst-like  millionaire with a penchant for sensationilizing the truth.  All his other  ventures fail, however.  He marries a president's niece, but the marriage  sours in the space of the famous montage of breakfasts.  He tries to  campaign for president and fails when an extramarital affair is revealed.  He marries the woman he had an affair with and tries to make her an opera  star, but fails because she stinks.  He tries to live like the filthy rich,  building a huge, never-finished mansion in Florida, but fails because it's  unfulfilling.  Eventually, everyone deserts him, and he dies a broken man.  That's basically it, though there is a major plot point I didn't discus.  (You probably know about it and can guess what it is, anyway.)
One  reviewer said it's sometimes intriguing, sometimes dull.  I agree.  One  reveiwer said that though the camera work wasn't innovative (It had been  tried before), it was the first time that kind of camera work was brought  into the limelight.  I agree; this was probably the first film where the  camera were a really obvious, integral part of the story.  I can't think of  or haven't seen a film that's ever really equaled the technical wizardry at  work here.  Remember, the technical aspect of the film is what really  inspired everyone to think it was the greatest film ever.  (More on that  later.)  The story has its dull, draggy points, but it does leave an  impression, to me at least the second time.  The acting is kind of  melodramatic, but not terrible.  Orson Welles is pretty good, required to  age about 50 years, and in the process going from the 25-year-old he was at  the time to looking almost exactly like he would when he was much older.  That is pretty remarkable, and it is kind of amazing that he made this  (starred in it, directed, produced, and collaborated on the screenplay with  Herman Mancewicz) when he was just 25.
Now, about the greatness of this  film.  I had to red a lot of the critical reviews before I got a proper  sense of it; it was kind of apparent while watching it, but not definitly  clear.  Since much of the world considers it the greatest film ever made,  you'd think there must be something to it.  However, some people are turned  off, since most of the people who think it's great or either that crazy  group of intellectuals or people who, it would seem, are just jumping on  the bandwagon.

No wonder it has won so many awards and is agreed to be to the film of the century by critics.  I saw it for my American  Lit/History class, and I could only say a mature person could truly enjoy  the film, understand its different meanings and symbolism.  I can't  even believe Orsen Wells was only 26 when it was made.  The directing was  awesome.  The lighting is great, and the content keeps you interested all  the way through. I was captivated by the mystery of Rosebud (and I'm proud  to say I figured out what Rosebud was - I watched that episode of the  Simpsons about Mr. Burns and Booboo...).  Now I just HAVE to see more of  Orsen Wells' films.
A true film classic, it should be livened up some  more people could see it or remade (oh I forgot, it doesn't have to be...  Hollywood directors steal all the ideas of the old classics anyway).
If I  could give this powerful movie 6 stars, I would, I'm just sad that people  can't appreciate great artistic, as well as historic films like this.  It's  also somewhat of a true story, based on Hearst and Pulitzer, historical  rival newspaper editors.
It was an epic story of a very rich old man that  died unhappily and a captivated America who loved and hated him.  People  wanted to find out what his dying words, ""Rosebud"" meant.
Live in this  age, we may probably judge a film in a very different way, but to compare  this film with Star Wars Series or Titanic or Saving Private Ryan, I can  say only one thing: don't compare an art work to those commercial flyers.  Those big hits, are just made for earning the viewer's money and tears, but  I don't care what the heck they really are,cause Hollywood (Hollybooo)  producers can only make worse than Citizen Kane. They have no standard of  ciematogphy, and directing (some director I didn't include: Francis Ford  Coppola, Tim Robins, Spike Lee, Clint Eastwood, Robert Alterman, and ....).

As a film student I was struck with the creativity (not necessarily revolutionary!! just nifty, and rare) of  the camera angles, fade-ins, creative use of the black and white medium,  etc. Plus something no one seems to have debated, how he made the sound  work with the picture, like with ""Sing Sing"" - I guess someone  said that. I like the aesthetic qualities, of the sets, sound, and picture  combined, a perfect aesthetic mix. BUT!  I didn't appreciate this until a  second viewing, when I could anticipate a particular mood and see how  Welles evoked it, rather than sit through a stark, slow, impersonal  documentary (what I felt the first time). The pacing, yes, is tedious, but  you grow to appreciate it because 1. it's more realistic - life is not fed  to us in MTV-style sound bites, and 2. it fits Kane the character,  especially as he grows more conceited, decrepit, and shallow. Note the VERY  slow scene near the end in the gargantuan living room where he sits down in  an easy chair, a mile away from Susan doing her puzzle, and suggests as if  she were sitting right next to him, that they go picnic. If you've grown up  on MTV, it's harder to appreciate the use of silence to create mood. The  acting, some have said, is less than perfect. This is true. Susan is whiney  and intolerable and Kane's friends, like Bernstein, don't really betray any  substance and are, to be truly honest, dull as dirt. The best films from  Hollywood's ""Golden Era"", or from any era, have memorable  characters; and if you really think, the only one here was Kane himself  (thanks to the incredible, articulate, bombastic Welles). The others were  (intentionally?) meant to be doorposts next to Kane, except Leland, and he  was only adequate. CK isn't the world's best film, since there are others  like it. But it's still worth a look, especially if you're into clever,  subtle bits that make you grin if you spot them.",938044800,6,2017,4.627118644067797

I saw someone reviewing it who said that Akira Kurisawa films are better. I beg ti  differ. This film has inspired me to do many things with the camera and  movies and stuff I was never interested in...until I saw the speech  scene...that one scene in itself was a remarkable scene.  Now, I'm going to  say that it probably is the best film of all time, BUT by far not the most  entertaining.

803695,4,6304119046,"Is Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever? For its time indeed, and even now, arguably. The question is whether you think it is. For some, it is a movie thats disconnected with the public. Movies like Schindler's List and  Saving Private Ryan, or Gone with the Wind, have this  ""connection"" to the audience that almost forces them to feel the  essense of the movie. I prefer movies that appeal an audience, not a bunch  of critics who don't eat a Mc. Donalds and drive Hondas. Those critics have  their opinions, the public has theirs. It is a good, movie, yes it is a  great movie. And to some it may even be the greatest ever made. But of  course thats just an opinion. I think there are movies that do things  better. If you want to see a good movie, see Red Violin, Shine, Forrest  Gump, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, or Starwars or something. But  Citizen Kane is one of those movies that you must see, not just hear about,  to believe. See the movie, THEN make an opinion, not vice-versa.",933638400,,1001,4.445054945054945

803854,5,6304119046,"About 10 years ago, I was near an art theatre in San Francisco that was playing ""Citizen Kane"".  I'd heard it was a great movie, but knew little else about it.  Fortunately, I had a few hours to kill, waiting for  my then-wife, so I went in to see it.  I came out convinced that Welles  was, without a doubt, an absolute genius!  I've seen ""Citizen  Kane"" many times since then, & I never fail to find something new  each time.
Orsen Welles co-wrote the screenplay, he produced the movie,  he directed it, he starred in it, and Orsen Welles was only 26.  At the  time of its release, ""Citizen Kane"" was controversial, political,  & an absolute breakthrough in filmmaking.
Welles's junxtaposition of  the time sequence of the flashback scenes which comprise the bulk of the  film is dramatic in & of itself, & his use of deep-focus  cinematography, while not original but borrowed from slightly earlier  German films, adds tremendously to the visual impact of many scenes. Deep  focus (enhanced depth of field) also meant that Welles the Director had to  work painstakingly to position each scene element for specific impact,  unable to use focus to direct the viewer's eye.
This film has become so  important in American culture that I've seen or heard indirect references  to ""Rosebud"" many times in other genres. When you learn at the  end of the movie what it refers to, you grasp its symbolism immediately  (& you see where others got the idea of using this technique in other  films). ""Citizen Kane"" may be in black & white, but its power  will make you forget that quickly, as you become immersed in the story.  The characterizations are true to the era, unlike the characterizations in  more recent films about the same era -- another point that makes  ""Citizen Kane"" a standout.",923702400,8,1786,4.711038961038961

803857,3,6304119046,"To clarify my review below, both the historical value and the artistic value of ""Citizen Kane"" is not questioned by me, nor can it be by  any sensible person. Indeed, perhaps only Griffith and Eisenstein have  advanced the art of cinema on a comparable level with Welles' debut  feature. Furthermore, Welles' early painstaking craftsmanship and  perfectionism are qualities sorely missed in today's cinema. The point I  originally intended, though, was simply my belief that ""Citizen  Kane"" no longer holds up as the end-all, be-all ultimate apex of the  screen; and to emphasize the fact that many of Welles'  ""innovations"" were more precisely re-discoveries. As to the  former statement, first let me say that I fully grasp the message of the  film; as one described it, that ""men are the sum of their  contradictions."" Yet, I find Welles' films emotionally chill,  humoristically vapid (see how Welles did without Mankiewicz!), and inspire  only aesthetically. Secondly, ""Citizen Kane"" is not the last word  in acting, narrative, photography, music, art direction, camera use, or  entertainment; nor does it acheive a mixture of these elements to the a  degree above all. Ensemble performances in dozens of movies (most old)  surpass this one's (""Magnificent Ambersons"",""The Little  Foxes"",""The Hustler"", etc.); the influential flashback  device was actually surpassed--though arranged in an even more complex  way--in ""The Killers""; black & white photography, in  ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"",""Kings Row"",""Oliver  Twist"", etc; musical accompaniment, ""The Devil and Daniel  Webster"",""Kings Row"",""Sergeant York"", etc; art  direction, ""Magnificent  Ambersons"",""Hunchback..."",""Oliver Twist"", etc;  camera movement reached its summit with Max Ophuls, and angles and lens  deployment in David Lean's early work; and entertainment is anybody's  choice. Furthermore, it is my experienced opinion that the film in which  the union of these elements was realized to a more brilliant degree than  any other was David Lean's (ignored) 1948 masterpiece, ""Oliver  Twist"" (see my review for the Criterion DVD release). At that, Lean  accomplished with ""Oliver Twist"" what Welles couldn't in  this masterwork, Lean PERFECTED all of the ""innovations"" that  Welles employed, while avoiding Welles' excessively heavy-handed style.  was not a Welles creation! The earlier films of Eisenstein and Mamoulian  display an equally imaginative treatment. 2.) Deep focus photography was  exercised effectively two years earlier in ""The Hunchback of Notre  Dame""; what Welles did was simply to improve the process, and show it  off to a much greater extent. 3.) The business of showing ceilings had  actually been used in a 1931 John Barrymore film, ""The Mad  Genius"", but had been found to be impractical with the old  single-microphone system. The recording breakthrough of ""His Girl  Friday"" made Welles' idea possible! To conclude, let me re-emphasize  that as a milestone, ""Citizen Kane"" is invaluable; but history's  No. 1 movie? The impression I get is that while indespensable to the film  student, let's not limit ourselves by the thinking that this work is the  Holy Grail of movies, either for craft or entertainment!",921196800,8,3205,5.51340206185567
