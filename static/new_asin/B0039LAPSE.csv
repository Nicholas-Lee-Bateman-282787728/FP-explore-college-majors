8392080,4,B0039LAPSE,Here's an interesting take on Jekyll / Hyde. The script is imaginative and well done. A worthy Hammer release that id definitely worth watching. Note that this can be played only on a computer or a region-free DVD player (which are not expensive and Amazon has a number of them). I didn't quite give 5 stars because the end gets a bit drawn out but doesn't ruin it. I would still recommend it.,1515801600,,393,4.397260273972603
