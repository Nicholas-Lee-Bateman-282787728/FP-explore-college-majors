7934091,4,B000059SIV,"Ok Argento movie....  Which means better than most other horror movies.
I could never find a way to get an English copy of this movie...  I suspect that it is due to some potential underage nudity...  Which is not graphic sexually (morgue autopsy nudity)...  And is very brief...
So what I did was get a French copy like this MDC, and then get an Srt English subtitle file off the internet and hand break them together to make a watchable movie....  The MDC disk does not come with subtitles so for an English viewer this is about the only way I could figure out to watch it.",1449878400,,575,4.336448598130841
