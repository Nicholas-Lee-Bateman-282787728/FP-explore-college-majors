8472615,5,B000PI3UIG,"I found Colour Blind, on YouTube, while doing a study on race relations. Actors were all great. Learned a lot about Ireland. I wish that Colour Blind was released as a region 1 format. But PS4 plays it. YouTube does not give you the ending. Which led to my purchasel. Definitely a movie worth watching again and again.",1521676800,,318,4.5
8472616,5,B000PI3UIG,Love everything she wrote and how well it translates to the screen.  Maybe there are some undiscovered works not yet adapted for DVD.,1368144000,,133,4.782608695652174
8472617,4,B000PI3UIG,"Colour Blind has all the ingredients of a great drama/romance story. Set in the north-east of England prior to World War 1 it tells to story of a romance which goes against the mores of the time...an English girl who falls for a black sailor & the ensuing consequences.
The settings are wonderful, the acting first rate. It is a movie not to be missed.",1312588800,,352,4.430769230769231
8472618,1,B000PI3UIG,I sure wish I had known that if you order a movie from the U.K. that I cannot play in on my D.V.D. player in the U.S. I sure wish Amazon had told me that before I bought the movie. Please let us know about that before we buy the movie. Thank You.,1303171200,3,246,3.660377358490566
