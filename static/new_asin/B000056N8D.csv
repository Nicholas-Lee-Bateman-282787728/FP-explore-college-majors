7932222,5,B000056N8D,What an awesome video! Just too bad it wasn't available on DVD because it is definitely a keeper. Show all of the best wins for the Avs up to the Stanley Cup victory and shows warts and all! Great shots of Patrick Roy.,1207526400,,218,4.093023255813954
7932223,3,B000056N8D,"This video seems to focus a bit too much on sentimentality and Ray Bourque, where it could have used increased coverage of the regular season or even just more detailed coverage of each finals game, great goals (like all of Chris Drury's during the playoffs), great saves (Bourque doing a mid-air stop of the puck), and even obstacles (Sakic injury during the first part of the LA series).",999561600,,389,4.735294117647059
7932224,3,B000056N8D,"I found this a disappointing video. Bob Hartley is allowed to make plenty of comments, but Forsberg only got a tiny mention and they didn't cover any of his frustration once he was out of the playoffs. The Devils, The Blues, nor the Kings had a voice in this, either. It would've been interesting to hear some of their comments about playing against the Avs. This video also spends too much time on Roy breaking Sawchuk's win record. That didn't even happen during the playoffs. The whole Roy thing is taken directly from 'NHL All-Access' and it isn't essential to this video. The All-Star coverage isn't terribly necessary, either. Sure it was fun to look at how many Avalanche members were involved in the All-Stars but NHL Productions should've made that a post-video chapter, or included it on the 'All-Access' DVD. If these guys decide to revamp this thing and release it on DVD, they should definitely do the following: Make the All-Stars coverage and Travis Roy's segments 'bonus' chapters (and develop them). Take Roy's Sawchuk record-breaker coverage out. Use better highlights and FOCUS on the playoffs.",998265600,3,1113,4.957219251336898
7932225,2,B000056N8D,"This was a real disappointment. The camera angles were terrible. Many of the best goals were impossible to see given the angles chosen.

They failed to talk about any of the important subtleties that made this an amazing playoff season - like the extraordinary play of the third and fourth line on Colorado after Forsberg went out from surgery. They overly focused on the big names and completely failed to represent the comprehensive team effort that enabled Colorado to win. Not to take anything away from the super stars, but that story is not the complete story.

There was no mention of Patrick's selflessness after winning the Conn Smythe for the third time, making him the only player in history to do it.  At least they covered Sakic (the captain) bucking tradition and allowing Bourque to be the first to hoist the cup.

There was almost no post game coverage that hadn't already been aired on ESPN.

This video seems to have been edited and produced either: a) *by* people who knew nothing about hockey, or b) *for* people who knew nothing about hockey

All-in-all, if you need a keepsake, buy it. But you will likely be disappointed with the content.",997315200,3,1161,4.751243781094527
7932226,4,B000056N8D,"I was born and raised in a suburb of Massachusetts and have been a Boston Bruins fan my whole life.  I became a Raymond Bourque fan when he played his first game in October 1979.  I became a Colorado Avalanche fan when Bourque joined the team during the 1999-2000 season, even though I'd kept my eye on Sakic, Forsberg, and company since their Quebec Nordique days in the Bruin's division.
This 50 minute video presents far less footage of the 2000-2001 season than I expected.  It spends five to seven minutes each on Patrick Roy's record-setting ""goalie wins"" game and Raymond's return to the Fleet Center in Boston.  I was hoping to see more footage from the regular season, since winning the best overall record isn't a shabby achievement!
The 2001 All-Star game, hosted by Denver, offered an opportunity for the Avs to display their big guns playing opposite each other.  Raymond's victory in the shooting accuracy contest is shown, along with a brilliant  Joe Sakic All-Star Game goal.  The blockbuster trade for outstanding defenseman Rob Blake is given its due as well.
The video presents an exciting summary of the Av's playoff march, including previously aired discussions of Chris Drury's former BU team-mate Travis Roy.  The coverage of the seven games against Los Angeles and New Jersey is adequate.  I missed the tension of actually watching each series.
If you followed the Avs closely this year, you've probably seen much of the seemingly ""special footage"" in this video.  I'd already seen the exact same segments on Bourque's return to Boston and Drury's opinion of his friend Travis Roy.  Nevertheless, this is a must-have video for Avs fans.  I hope the NHL releases a video on Bourque's career, now that he's retired and awaiting entry to the Hall of Fame.",995328000,4,1776,4.883333333333334
7932227,5,B000056N8D,"When your favorite team is eliminated from any post-season play, it seems like forever until the next season starts. Hockey's ""second season"" starts in April and goes until June, and many Boston Bruins fans know what a long summer it usually can be. But following former Bruin #77 Raymond Bourque and the Colorado Avalanche in their quest for the Stanley Cup was nothing short of miraculous with all the ""story book"" finishes. Watch from the first drop of the puck in October to the tear-inducing final moments when Bourque hoists ""the hardest earned trophy in all of sports."" A must for ANY fan of the coolest game on the planet!",994723200,2,630,4.736363636363636
7932228,5,B000056N8D,"Despite the fact that this video isn't out yet, I saw almost every game that the Avalanche played this season. All of the players played 100% every night.
I'm sure the video will also document the story behind Bourque's 16W mission, the trade that brought in Rob Blake from Los Angeles, Patrick Roy's record-breaking win in Washington, and Peter Forsberg's season ending spleen removal.
If you are a true hockey fan, you must purchase this video tape. Especially if you're a fan of the Colorado Avalanche. If you're a fan of the Devils, you might have second thoughts.",993254400,3,568,4.8061224489795915
