The Funko Horror Classics horror movie figurines fir perfectly within the village, which is spread out across our dining room dinner table every fall.  The have articulation, and pretty darn good detail.  (I have also included ""The Invisible Man,"" ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" ""Michael Myers,"" (From the Halloween movies.)  The guy who wears the fright mask from the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, even Freddy Kruger from ""Nightmare On Elm Street.""  The price point is right on as well, 8-10 bucks!

Two months later, I also create a miniature ""Dickens (As in Charles) Christmas Village.  The pieces are not plastic, but hand painted porcelain, and a perfect fit for a re-creation of a ""turn of the century"" English village.

The packages have also arrived very fast, (And no, I don't have Amazon's ""Prime"" 2 day service!)  and also always intact!

These people know what they are doing!  :o)",1505865600,,1057,5.046242774566474
8395929,4,B003F674AU,"Manhunt is a 1969 British TV series produced by London Weekend, set in France beginning in 1942, and follows the adventures of three fugitives from the German army.

RAF flyer Jimmy Porter (Alfred Lynch) bails out over France, and crosses paths with an underground group led by Vincent (Peter Barkworth), a British agent.  Initially, there isn't much trust between the two men, but they team up to help keep Anne Marie Poitiers, codename ""Nina"" (Cyd Hayman), a member of the Resistance who has vital information, from falling into German hands.

This is an unusual and very extended wartime drama, that in 26 episodes, covers a lot of ground.  It begins with the fugitives on the run from the Germans, but there is discord within the group, with the mercurial Nina most often at the heart of the matter.  Abwer Sergeant Gratz (Robert Hardy) is in pursuit, and demonstrates a flair for the dramatic, and remarkable authority for a mere enlisted man.

Most of the series is shot on video tape, which along with the type of stories, the theatrical acting style, and way the program is edited, gives Manhunter a look and feel that is quite similar to a soap opera.  Many of the early episodes feature extensive location work outdoors, but in later episodes, most of the scenes are shot on studio sets.

With broken continuity, and divergent storylines, the episodes are a mixed bag with a good deal of variety.  Transitioning from a tale of evasion, Manhunter becomes increasingly convoluted, as the fugitives become separated, and engage in various deceptions.  After the split, the episodes usually focus on specific characters, while totally excluding others.

Running for 26 episodes, it would be too much to expect Manhunt to sustain a steady level of suspense, and that is indeed the case, as the tension ebbs and flows.  The separate story format does create some uncertainty about what may be coming next, and the program also features unexpected flashes of violence.

The British actors who are supposed to be German or French, mostly speak with their native English accents and mannerisms, which fails to generate a great sense of realism.  The outrageous behavior of Sergeant Gratz, who sometimes acts like he should be on Monty Python, is probably the most discordant aspect of the entire series.  Despite being overdramatic and even ridiculous at times, Manhunt does entertain, and features some good performances.

While there are other key subplots, including an attempt to obtain a sample from a top secret Nazi weapon, it is Nina, who provides the motivation for much of the action, as Manhunt is really more about the pursuit of a woman.  Cyd Hayman gives a standout performance as mystifying Nina, who seems to be torn by too many desires.

Released in 2010, in a seven DVD set, Manhunt probably won't have much appeal for fans of traditional World War II movies, but if you're into extended soap opera type dramas, in a wartime setting, Manhunter might prove to be an obscure gem.  Unfortunately, there are no bonus features to provide some insights into this intriguing program.",1413676800,2,3095,4.94015444015444
8395930,5,B003F674AU,"A landmark in British television drama,  this series ran for two seasons, 1969-1970. I saw part of the original broadcast as a teenager, and found it enthralling. I was brought up on American network TV, and Manhunt was so unbelievably superior tp the best of American prime time shows, which were then all on the mental level of Branded or The Flying Nun. There were no intelligent historical dramas, period. Manhunt's cast was very fine--Alfred Lynch, an excellent actor, as Jimmy the downed RAF pilot, the unparalleled Peter Barkworth as the Resistance leader Vincent, and the subtle and riveting Robert Hardy as Sgt. Gratz. Cyd Hayman was well cast as Nina, and she made the character believably annoying (because she is young, ignorant, and full of herself) and sympathetic at the same time, and for the same reasons. Take a rather ordinary, pretty, naive young woman, who just wants to feel needed and be treated well by men, and put her in the custody of some Nazis (and other fanatics), and watch what happens. Things fall apart. This show was about the effects of war and  human evil on a variety of people and on the society they live in.  The anti-heroic ethos of the show is not surprising given its date of origin--this was de rigueur at the time for writers of any quality.  This type of television was just getting under way in 1970, and the production values are as good as the producers' shoestring budgets could make them. If Manhunt had been filmed a couple of years earlier, it would have been in black and white. Lacking the sumptuous production budgets that came later on, guess what decent British TV shows had to fall back on? Acting. Fortunately the country was neck-deep in acting talent. Talent? No, superbly accomplished professionals of the highest order. BTW, the few Amazon customers who panned the series clearly have no head for anything subtle or intelligently written.",1405900800,4,1903,4.828220858895706
8395931,4,B003F674AU,"Why there never is written if there is some English subtitles ? Sometimes, noting means there are, sometimes there aren't.

Is it impossible that the studios would precise this point, in any case ??

8395932,2,B003F674AU,"I should not have bought this series. Let's put it this way, I couldn't wait until it was over! I will donate it to our public library, so I have something to feel good about.

And then the ending. They dragged Nina all over occupied France, so they could get her to England with all the info she had in her head about the French underground..only to find out at the end that her info was obsolete. The writers didn't even make us feel good that something was accomplished!

In the opening scene, one French resistance leader wanted to shoot her so the Germans would not capture her with all this ""vital"" personnel info. They should have shot her and ended the series there.

Don't waste your money.",1327276800,,699,4.4453125
8395933,3,B003F674AU,"Started out slow and continued slow until the last few discs. Cyd Heyman cried and stumble and fell far too much. Alfred Lynch was obnixious, and for a trained military combat pilot appeared undisciplined, obnoxious and downright stupid at times.",1321142400,,246,5.175
8395934,5,B003F674AU,"Manhunt is a British TV serial that was produced in 1970.  It is an excellent story, 26 episodes, each about 50 minutes in length.  The characters are richly detailed and well portrayed by Alfred Lynch, Peter Barkworth and Cyd Hayman.  It is an engaging story about an English pilot, Squadron Leader Jimmy Porter (played by Alfred Lynch), who was shot down in France and is trying to return to England.  He meets up with a French resistance leader code-named Vincent (played by Peter Barkworth), who is tasked with getting to England a young woman code-named Nina,(played by Cyd Hayman), possessing vital Resistance information.  The three are inextricably bound together as they journey through France attempting to escape the Germans. Other reviews point out some weaknesses: film quality is not optimal (remember it was made 40 years ago - film technology has changed) poor acting / British actors portraying French and German characters (they did their best and I was fine with their performances) German uniform inaccuracies (noticeable but not a big deal).  In spite of these limitations, this is an excellent dramatic story that allows the viewer to escape.

8395935,5,B003F674AU,"Unlike the other reviewer, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I am quite a WWII buff, and I thought the story was quite good. The first hour was not the most intriguing hour of television I have seen, but give it time.

  The actors, for the most part, are talented British character actors. I was amazed at how incredibly beautiful the heroine, Cyd Hayman was and still is. She has the ethereal beauty of those gorgeous actresses from the 40's, like Gene Tierney. I am very surprised that with her talent and beauty she did not become a star.

  There were a few technical mistakes made concerning the uniforms of the SS and a few of the  Resistance fighters' holsters were obviously empty of firearms when they were about to do battle with the nasty Germans.

  A British actor playing a German sergeant was annoying and he grated on my nerves. He was cast as an intelligence operative by the name of SGT Gratz. I kept hoping someone would bump him off and put me out of my misery.

  So, if you have nothing to do for 26 hours or so some weekend, pull up a comfortable chair, pop some corn, kick back, and enjoy the series.",1281744000,15,1125,4.402912621359223
