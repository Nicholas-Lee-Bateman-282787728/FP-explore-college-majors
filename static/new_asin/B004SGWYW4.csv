4462364,5,B004SGWYW4,"To sum up high school of the dead for those interested. I will skip the names and all that other junk you don't need to hear until you actually watch it.
  So high school of the dead starts off with alot of action. I.E. a zombie head getting smashed into a wall. Soon you will notice the untold amounts of fan-service scattered throughout I.E. watch the opening on youtube.

In short.
if you like anime
if you like zombies
if you like ecchi / fan-service
if you like action

then this is your kind of anime. which I then highly recommend",1304380800,13,537,4.287128712871287
4462365,4,B004SGWYW4,"By now we're all well aware of and are probably active participants in the media zombie pandemic.  What began with classic horror films has spawned countless novels, comics, television, comedies, video games, and everything else you can see or hear, infecting pop culture with the undead virus.  But I have been wondering something for quite some time now:  when will anime represent for the walking dead?  Well, that question has been answered, fellow animation fanatics.  Highschool of the Dead is here and delivering the thrills of classic Romero and the coolness of The Walking Dead, while utilizing the full spectrum of the anime genre to make this zombie apocalypse stand out as it's own animal.  And it is so close to perfectly awesome it hurts.

Before I whine about the show's failing, let me fill you in on the good.  There's lots of it.  Right from the get-go Highschool of the Dead gets your heart racing with pure horror and some of the coolest action sequences ever animated.  As the sudden invasion quickly spreads through the halls of the high school, we are introduced to the individuals who will become our heroes.  While most students panic and quickly become prey to the ever-increasing host of ghouls, a few individuals pull it together and improvise means to fight back.  The otaku gun nut.  The kendo princess.  The ordinary kid whose best is brought out by extraordinary circumstances.  The haughty intellectual.  The airheaded school nurse. Over the first two episodes, these people will coalesce into a force to be reckoned with.  The show does an admirable job of remaining character-based and developing the relationships between it's survivors well after the extremely hectic initial outbreak, and as far as opening salvos go in survival horror, this show takes the damn cake for sure.  The art and animation are top-notch, the characters are instantly memorable, and also it's zombies!  And anime!  Sugoi, neh?

Okay, time for some of that old-time tough love.  This show is one of the most exciting and cool anime series I've come across in a good while, and it ticks almost all of my boxes for a great zombie story, but on one front it really blows it. Rant mode: engaged.  I'm writing this paragraph as an introduction speech to present Highschool of the Dead with the first annual Najica Blitz Tactics Award for Achievement in Moronic Fanservice.  Hold your applause.  This is not a good thing.  God, this show could even teach Najica a thing or two.  It's frankly embarrassing.  I'm a big fan of sexuality in entertainment, but only when it is portrayed in a realistic and adult manner or at least matches the tone of the story.  But in a show where high school students are seeing their teachers and classmates being torn apart only to rise again and attack them in turn, having a character with ridiculously enormous breasts that make boingy noises and fly all over the place independently of each other every time she so much as blinks around is not only distracting, it literally brings the entire show down a notch.  I can deal with the pantyshots in every scene, but the incessant focus on the female characters' boobs makes this show infuriating.  At one point we get a bullet's-eye-view shot as one girl's breasts use a scissor motion to dodge said bullet.  And the bullet was fired from a rifle using another girl's breasts as a bipod (they slosh in slow motion with each shot fired).  Jesus God, WHY?!  Everything else about this show is so good!  The immaturity shown in HotD's use of fanservice is probably the most atrocious thing I've ever seen in terms of bringing down an otherwise amazing production.  Honestly, I'd be tempted to knock off another half star or so from the rating if the first season's second half didn't tone it down so much.  Be warned.

[sighs] Glad to get that off my chest.  Okay, the good of HotD far outweighs the idiotic breast and panty fixation in an otherwise great show.  In fact, this would be instantly pushing for a spot on my favorite anime ever list if the childish sexuality had been presented in a more mature manner or omitted altogether.  If you love zombies and anime, this is a must-see.  This is brought to us by the same man who gave us the Death Note and Black Lagoon animes, after all. Each ep has a post-credits sequence that is often important to the story which makes the show feel even more theatrical than it already is and I like that the ending theme changes as well.  A mere 12 episodes is far too short a season for a show like this, and once you see the nod to Romero that is the final shot of the first season, I suspect you will be as excited as I am for the next chapter in the saga.  If they keep the fanservice manageable from here on out, we may just have a classic on our hands.",1301875200,139,4790,4.644470868014269

4462382,5,B004SGWYW4,"Otaku John, the anime / manga / light novel fan, here to review a great anime series that hits 5-stars on all levels. High School of the Dead, abbreviated as H.O.T.D. by anime fans, is a series that excites, entertains, and keeps you glued to your TV, episode after episode.  I'm not normally a fan of ""Zombies"", in film, TV, or books, and think the genre's jumped the shark everywhere.  Except for this Series!  Even if you don't like Zombie flicks, you'll love H.O.T.D., because the characters are so unique and well-developed, as is the story line.  The animation is spectacular, and the episodes mix action and humor so flawlessly seamless, that you're laughing one minute, and the on the edge of your seat the next.  This has some moments of humorous fan service, but not overdone, and is very bloody / violent, but not gory.  That being said, it is for mature audiences.  It's a true sad pity that the author passed away, as we may not be getting any more of these great mangas / or have them developed into more seasons of anime.  Nevertheless, the story is so good, this complete collection stands on its own.  There's also a short 1-episode OVA called drifters of the dead that's hilarious and a great addition to this series.  For true Otaku fans out there like me, you'll appreciate the little anime cross-reference nuances of this series like the gun-nut character Kohta Hirano, who looks like the manga author of Hellsing, ""Kouta Hirano"", and bokken-toting swords-woman Saeko Busujima, who has also appeared in a cross-over of Triage-X.  As always, Amazon delivers great value in anime, so get this one today, you won't be disappointed.",1503619200,,1649,4.77112676056338

4462388,3,B004SGWYW4,"Kind of upset that the Drifters of the Dead edition, which has the complete series plus the OVA, says it has English audio but does not for the OVA. That's false advertising. I'll get over it, considering that I can just get the OVA elsewhere cheaply, but that was a real disappointment and should be part of the product description.

Edit: Should you buy this edition, know that it plays in region B.  The OVA plays in both region B and C, and the OVA that I got from a different supplier plays only on region C.  This is a little annoying, and severely frustrating for anyone who doesn't have a Blu ray player that plays all three regions like mine does.  Mine was $150.00, and I recommend getting it, at least for the sake of not having to read labels ever again.",1493424000,3,766,4.335664335664336

4462397,5,B004SGWYW4,"- Synopsis: Life starts off as the usual routine. Until one day, it all suddenly changes for the absolute worst for that nobody could have imagined. Blood-thirsty zombies that seemingly come out of nowhere suddenly start attacking the living and converting them like a virus. Most of humanity has turned into a zombie. Only the fortunate, and resourceful are able to survive in this even harsher and unforgiving world. Join the struggles of these unique cast of ordinary and talented individuals as they attempt to survive and look for survivors in a world full of death and carnage.

===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Keep in mind that the amount of blood and gore is very high in this anime. Furthermore, this is also fan-service heavy and will show plenty of panty-shots. If either of those are not something you like in an anime, it would be wise to skip out on this.

- Analysis: The main character is fairly likable. He definitely isn't a push-over like many other main characters are. He's not intelligent, but he is clever and resourceful, as well as a quick-thinker which helps him adapt. In animes like these, those traits and skills are necessary to survive. The unfortunate, weak and/or ones that aren't able to adapt, are the ones that end up getting killed. The anime also emphasizes that there is power in numbers, and that going lone-wolf isn't ideal to survive.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-ray discs that have a runtime of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA due to high amounts of violence and sexual content and partial nudity.

===========================================================================================================

- Recommendations: Claymore, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, Parasyte -the maxim-, Akame ga Kill, Deadman Wonderland, and Attack on Titan.",1482710400,11,1939,5.578231292517007

It's a little too much for me but that is partly why I am giving it four stars as opposed to five.  There has been an attempt for years to bring this back for a season two but those dreams are really just non-existant now, also part of the reason for only four stars.  There is quite a bit of gore and horror, this is a pretty graphic that shows how some pretty messed up things that happens during a zombie outbreak.  There is an OVA that you can also get.  I have it also and will write a review about it at some point.  I recommend this series because the animation is very good, the dubbing is spectacular, and the story as a whole is phenominal.

There is a minor subplot involving the US and authorities that is not as developed as the girls.

This is a fun zombie series with plenty of up-skirt and cleavage shots. You get to watch each 25-26 minute episode which includes opening and closing credits plus sometimes a flashback and a preview. Would have been a cleaner story to have just combine everything into one feature without the breaks.

The constant hiatuses also speak volumes of the quality of this work. Read The Walking Dead and the World War Z books instead.

High school of the dead (HOTD) tells the story of a group of high school pupils who survive minute 1, day 1 of a zombie apocalypse. The series is a mixture of action sequences and conflict as an odd group seek safety and shelter. This is quite a dark series which investigates relationships, power, and survival. I wasn't expecting the emotional complexity, suspense and plot depth that this anime delivers. I gave this five stars, not because it's all fun and games but because it isn't. The anime takes a global view (how different countries manage a massive lethal event) and a personal view (how families and power groups adapt) and for its depth, range, and psycho-drama I highly recommend it.",1423958400,,836,4.732876712328767

4462478,5,B004SGWYW4,"First, if you are going to watch this, figure that the person who wrote this tale must have been 20 years old and never been on a date.  (Note: I don't know if that's true, but read the rest of the review before you flame me.)  I say this because the story itself is one of the better pieces of ""zombie apoc"" fiction I've found.  The characters charge forward and succeed in saving themselves and others rather than just hiding in a basement while the zombie horde flows around them.

And that made it possible to really like the characters.  Even the fat one with the love of guns is more than just a clich despite being nothing but a clich.  It's a fun tale with some interesting observations. (that I don't entirely agree with)

That said, there is a reason some people dislike this series and it goes back to the start of my review.  The artist/writer who created this series had a definite big-breast fetish and loved to give fan service to his readers.  Shots of bouncy boobs in bras and lacy panties are far more common then necessary.  Worse, there is one entire episode that is a long bathtub scene for the 4 ""women"" in the group and let's just say that while it doesn't show everything it suggests it very well.

If you can ignore the jiggle physics and the fan service, this is a solid series that is quite fun to watch as it does a surprisingly good job of bringing emotion into the character's relationships and struggle.  But if you are easily offended, stay away.",1420588800,13,1478,4.413284132841328

4462483,3,B004SGWYW4,"I have some mixed feelings about this series.

First off the gore is actually toned down and sexual themes are ramped up compared to the manga. Most gore in this anime is slightly off screen or cut away. No idea why at all. They show it in the manga for a quick look search for the scene where Saya kills a zombie with a drill then compare the anime scene of it to the manga, and I think you will start to understand how they do that kind of stuff the rest of the series.  The other problem that I had is the english voice cast. Let it be known that I like dubs, but the dub for this is pretty bad. I don't think all the blame goes to the voice cast, some of it has to be the ADR staff screwing up. A couple examples are Saya's voice actress till about the last 4 episodes sounds like she ate a pack of cigarettes every day, not smoked but ate them! Takishi's script must have had a question mark instead of commas. You will be hard pressed to listen to some lines where he is speaking without him greatly changing the pitch of his voice. The last part I think is some problem with ADR. Takishi is doing a speech while Kohta is doing something dumb in the background. In the sub what he is doing is just low background noise. In the dub you can hardly hear what Takishi is saying because Kohta is screaming random lines louder than Takishi can talk.

Even with these problems I do like the series as a whole. I wish the manga would pick up again so more chapters could be made for a 2nd season.",1417392000,2,1494,4.074829931972789

4462487,3,B004SGWYW4,"I haven't really watched much anime lately, but this caught my interest when I was at the library.

I love zombies and I also enjoy the occasional anime.  This was actually a somewhat successful union of the two genres.  We have several kids at a high school when the zombie apocalypse begins.  They are all pretty mis-matched but they manage to come together and fight off the zombies and flee the school.  They hole up and manage to find weapons and defend themselves.

The downside of this anime is that there is way too much fan service.  We have constant upskirt shots and the women are constantly in positions that show off their panties.  Not to mention the women all have huge breasts that are always bouncing and jiggling and pressing up against things and are the main focus of the camera.  Even in the middle of combat we have instances of the women's breasts being used to balance a sniper rifle and also a bullet passing between a character's breasts in Matrix bullet time.  Or while fighting with swords and guns, the women are always kicking and jumping racing around, causing their mini-skirts to fly up and show off their panties or their breasts to bounce around a lot.  Now I don't mind this in anime when it's done in moderation, but this one takes it to extremes.

This was just too much, when you are relying on bouncing breasts constantly rather than a good story and character development, it really is a failure in my opinion on the part of the writers of the show.

The only other downside is that once you get to the part where they get to the mansion, there are hardly any zombies in the show until the final episode.  But I still enjoyed the story regardless of these flaws.

The fighting is awesome, and the artwork in this anime is just amazing!  I have to admit my favorite characters are Saeko, (the resident samurai chick), and Khota, (Our overweight Otaku gun nut).  Those characters had the most development if you asked me and their stories were the most interesting.

If you are a fan of anime you will enjoy this or if you like zombies, you will find this interesting as well.

4462502,3,B004SGWYW4,"Zombies are invadeing and a group of highschoolers all in a group to survive.

Plot and characters (minor spoilers) : One day in school Takashi Komuro is sitting depressed because his girlfriend dumped him. As he sits and lets sadness take him he sees by the front gate a zombie bite a teacher and panic threw out the whole school begins, people turning into zombies and others running for their lives. Takashi along with his ex girlfriend Rei Miyamoto, a kendo fight Saeko Busujima, a nerdy overweight boy Kohta Hirano who is secretly a full card carring NRA gun loving shooting boy with a secretly sadistic crazy side, a girl named Saya Takagi who (honestly watching the entire series) does nothing but complain and cant fight or anything helpful to help the group.  The nurse of the group Shizuka Marikawa who has a ditzy personatily other than being the driver and medic of the group doesnt do much. Then theres Alice Maresato a 7 year old who is saved from the zombies, dosnt help the group much but is cheery and makes the situation have more a smile to it.
  The group above was part of a bigger group but choose to leave because of Koichi Shido a teacher from the school who escaped with them but in reality acts like a cult leader who the only (not imporant at all just filler background people in the show) all listen to and eat up all his words like he is the only savior in the zombie world.

Audio and voice acting: I feel like the voices meet all the characters as they are

Pros: the story alright, there is a lot of blood because zombies will be dropping dead, also in later episodes it shows the girls pretty much wearing very little to no clothes at all (but still censores the privet parts down stairs)

Cons: (minor spoilers) like above the story is alright but really there is none, like in the begining Takashi and Saeko want to find their parents but that plan is dumped quickly. The cult leader teacher could have had a much bigger part in the show but is really left out and you pretty much need to guess what happens because they don't tell you. I wish the story line was better written out If your ""NOT"" of fan of almost nude or fan service shows then this show is NOT for you. My biggest con of this is the zombie killing, other than seeing a zombie take a head shot with a bullet all the zombie head bashing, slicing, smashing or other melee weapons is censored, only guns in the show the uncensored deaths of zombies with their heads exploding.

Over all: I give this a 3.2 out of 5 stars. If you truly watch this objectivly then you can see they could have done better with the show. More indepth story or something to make it a tad better",1405296000,,2670,4.368951612903226

4462509,4,B004SGWYW4,"I watched this series with my sister because we were going through survivor horror games and horror anime and this ended up on the list. Every week when it came out online we would watch it together. This anime does what happens in many shows that are in the west only with an anime feel to it this time.

So the story is your typical zombie outbreak that came out of nowhere and the main characters have to band together to survive. It really is that simple.

The anime only goes up to the first arc in the manga so not much is done for the first season except to establish the characters. That's fine to establish how bad the world has gone because of the zombies. At the same time though, I feel like the most serious scenes in the series were ruined by the over the top fanservice. Like I wish the anime could stay serious for a couple of minutes without the bouncing noises. Not to say that in some scenes this was hilarious (the bullet Matrix scene anyone?) But if there is a season 2, they need to get the plot going before it falls into a fanservice excuse. Zombie animes are hard to find in Japan after all.",1401321600,,1116,4.234741784037559

If you can look past the random fan service, inappropriate angles, touches, grabs and such you will enjoy it.

I'm a big Zombie fan so watching/reading this was a must. The English voice actors are very well done, the quality of the animation is wonderful. Heck I even enjoy the soundtrack. The story is one of survival and focus' on a group of high school students who group together to find their families, find safety and work towards living another day. Mainly focusing in on everyone's personal struggle with coping that killing these ""zombies"" are no longer human and going from there. Cute relationships develop and the characters are all very personable. You won't be bored visually, mentally or if you are a pervert yeah.. You get it.

4462526,5,B004SGWYW4,"This series i think is meant to be about zombie apocalypse, but not really lol. When watching this it does have those basic points about a zombie ap. But this leans heavily towards the ecchi genre and introduced me to echhi. So if your looking for boobies and ecchi this is your anime!",1391817600,,285,4.39622641509434
4462527,5,B004SGWYW4,"I originally watched this series when it streamed on Netflix, and I enjoyed it right away. This ainme immediately sets your expectations after the first few minutes. The plot revolves around a group of Japanese high school students who witness a outbreak of the undead and then learn to how to survive as the pandemic escalates.

You will find a lot of critics out there that will run this anime to the ground, but honestly, what were they expecting?  This anime is about busty high school girls killing zombies.  If you are looking for something better, like the meaning of life, then this is definitely not the anime for you.

Regardless, the story keeps you interested from start to finish, and by the time it's over,  you will be carving for more. The action is epic, the humor is ecchi, the girls are sexy and the character development grows as the adventure continues. In addition, the music is AWESOME. The opening gets you pumped up for the action and there is a different ending song for every episode, all unique in their own right.

If you like action and ecchi anime, or if you just like zombies in general, I would recommend this Blu-ray to you. The sound, picture and anime style is amazing, and every otaku should have at least one copy of this anime.

If you like this anime, I highly recommend that you also read the manga (same name).  Furthermore, WE NEED TO SEE A SECOND SEASON! Please show your support!

And of all the great moments were they reference things at random like when one character says, ""I like turtles"" and making the point that they know its a zombie apocalypse, and saying this isn't like a video game or movie, this is the real thing, which got me loving it b/c it beats the in denial perspective of ""I don't know whats going on!!"" or ""What's wrong with those ppl?!"", cause even we can tell what a zombie apocalypse will be like... and it would be more like Dead Rising 3 with vehicles, psychopaths, crafted weapons, get the hell out of the quarantined area and survive.",1390780800,,718,4.488549618320611

4462544,5,B004SGWYW4,"I started reading High school of the Dead after a suggestion by an anime seller.  I liked it for several reasons but the main reason was Saeko.  What's not to like about a girl with a sword?

A coworker saw me reading one of the books and told me about the series.  Of course I had to get it.

Two things to note:

1) It says the complete series which is sort of correct. It's the complete series of season 1 as it only covers about 5 of the Manga books from the series.  I should also comment that it stays reasonably faithful to the story.  There are changes but not enough for comment.
2) This is for mature audiences. There are plenty of bouncing boobs, blood and suggestive shots of the girls.

H.O.T.D is a zombie apocalypse story which starts in a private high school where the main character Takashi is pondering his misery when he observes the start of the plague in his school.  It quickly spreads and he tries to save his childhood love (Rei) and her boyfriend which happens to be his best friend.  The school becomes inhabitable due to the amount of zombies so they have to escape and along the way they pick up other survivors.

Much of the stories involve running, fighting and hiding as they watch the world descends into chaos.

There are 12 episodes which at first I thought was rather small for the $40 price tag.  My coworker said that is actually a good price as they are expensive in Japan.

I would like to see season 2 but it didn't happen as I read the show did not do well in Japan.  I have read a few rumors that second series was announced.

Overall, I liked the series.  Plenty of action, bouncy boobs, humor, great artwork, and interesting characters.  I hope the second season happens.",1388448000,,1715,4.370253164556962
4462545,5,B004SGWYW4,"This is a good series, definitely not for kids. The art and animation is great, very visually stunning. I do wish that the series would have been longer, possibly a season 2 coming? Essentially this is a story about the zombie apocalypse and a group of large-breasted high schoolers (and two lucky guys) who get caught in the midst. A typical zombie story, however the dub was great and the artwork was amazing. I was impressed with the accuracy of the guns which were used, and the way the zombies moved. One drawback was perhaps the size of these girls' busts, it's almost out of control bouncing lol One character must have boobs the size of watermelons, which is over the top even for me!

4462555,2,B004SGWYW4,"This was... not good.  I think that sums up my entire experience with this.  I had high expectations, and as a hard core zombie fan, I was actually more forgiving of this anime than I otherwise would have been.  Not good, but I didn't outright hate it.  I've seen worse, which isn't saying too much I suppose.

The English and Japanese VAs were good and the sound effect also good.  I feel that everyone did a good job in that department and the music also helped the mood and atmosphere of the series.

The animation was nice.  Very clean as digital cell coloring tends to be, and smooth. However, a few scenes were a little awkward where they seemed to incorporate computer models for the characters - if you've seen Blassreiter you know what I'm talking about.  These were fairly few though, so it wasn't a big deal.

The story was... sub par and unoriginal.  As I have stated though, I am a big fan of zombie films in general so I wasn't actually bothered by the weak, generic plot.  If you're looking for something more original however, this is not for you.  It was your typical zombie outbreak, survivors run for cover, ta-da.  There's a lot of inconsistencies in the series, that are glaringly obvious and makes it seem like a chimp typed out some of the plot while smoking a lot of pot.

The characters.  Here is where my gripe takes hold and drops this sucker down to two stars while I rage in frustration at how appalling terrible these characters are.  They are flat, two dimensional, irritating, and so boring I had a hard time getting through this.  The only characters that has any sort of depth (not too much either) is the husky kid, Kohta Hirano and to a degree Saeko Busujima (mostly because she seems to be a murderous sociopath).  The main male character, Takashi Komuro, is so excruciatingly boring in every respect he's almost painful to watch.  He has no emotional complexity to him at all, and the main female character, Rei Miyamoto, is even worse.  Oh god, don't even get me started on Saya Takagi.  ""I'm a mean tough smart girl, but only to cover up the fact I felt my parents didn't love me enough.""  Really?  I get that they're teenagers but holy Christ they are all so stereotypical without anything interesting or complex about their personalities.  And then we get to Shizuka Marikawa.  Big breasted blond bimbo who is book-smart, somehow.  Allegedly she is a doctor.  I don't really... I mean... argh.  Please, someone save me from the stereotypes and these horrifying excuses for characters.

The fan service was, in my opinion, over the top making the series awkward and hard to get through.  It relentlessly interrupted the action sequences, disrupting the entire flow of the scene.  Let me state, for the record, I do not dislike fan service.  I have nothing against fan service animes.  HOWEVER, in this anime it was pointless and done to death.  Let me recreate some of my viewing experience for you:
STABBING, KILLING-*BOOBS!!*-BLOOD, GORE-*PANTY SHOT!!!*-SHOOTING, RUNNING-*JIGGLING BOOBS!!!*-KILLING, MORE BLOOD-*JIGGLING BOOBS AGAIN!!!!-*SURVIVAL, RUNNING, JUMPING-*PANTIES!!!!!!!!*-

And I hadn't even been watching a full ten minutes yet.  I am also not super sure what everyone's breasts were made out of but they jiggled far more than a boob should.  They actually bounced and flapped around as the girl's spoke.  I don't know about you but I don't know who's breasts waggle about as they are speaking.

So, it was alright.  I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you desperately need a panty shot or breasts to vibrate for no apparent reason every five seconds to be able to get through a show.",1378252800,6,3642,4.781701444622793

Oh, and on DVD, the nurse's Eiken-sized tits are totally uncensored when she's naked. SQUEE!",1376524800,,482,4.795180722891566
4462560,4,B004SGWYW4,"Mid range zombie anime, with a lot of boobs and butt for attention grabbing.

Overall story and character development is weak to light.  Zombie outbreak, kids and adults in school try to survive, a little background and interaction to keep the folks a little more than 2 dimension.  Not the best story ever, but passable for what the series required.  The average person is mostly interested in ""person surviving or being eaten by zombies"", so you don't need a lot of info on ""generic zombie fodder B"" guy, right?

As others have said, a lot of the series is stuffed (pun not intended) with shots and exaggerations of boobs and butt shots and events surrounding such things (shower scene much?).  For the most part, you don't really notice it that much.  However, there are some moments where this fixation does drag the events to a crawl, or a dead stop.  That is the thing that bugs me.  I don't mind a little T&A focus here and there, but when you put the story on a shelf for 5 minutes and basically shoot a soft core porn, I can't help but sigh and fast forward.

The highlight in the series, in my humble opinion, is the animation quality.  It is some of the best work I have seen around, in this form of animation.  A shocking surprise, when you don't have high hopes for the series overall.  If you can find clips on Youtube and see some of the shots, you'll see what I am talking about.  Very well done work.

There's also some funny moments in the show (gotta have some comic relief).

Resident Evil itself failed as a horror movie, it was not scary, it was not great, it's average at best.
This anime follow the footstep of an average action/horror movie series resident evil is bound to fail.

Let's take a look at my unbiased rating for this anime:

1. Does this anime exploit nudity to get viewer's attention? No, it doesn't (-0 star)

2. Story line: Average, very non-creative and lack of imagination. It's a copycat of Resident Evil series. Okay, because I am unbiased, I'll only -2 stars on this category.
Those of you who saw all the Resident Evil movies like me, you will hate this anime, and you will get sick of it after few episodes.
I have watched anime that rated 1star, 2star, 3star, 4star, 5stars, whether the anime was really really bad or really really good, I finished watching all the episodes of them, but this one is an exception, this is the first anime that I starts to watch then gave up after 4 episodes.

Advice: This anime is not for kids, it has alot of violence and blood. If you are an mature audience, then you most likely have watched all the Resident Evils, so you will struggle if you watch this anime. If you have been living in a cave and don't know what Resident Evil is, then it might be okay for you to watch it.

Summary:
This anime deserve an unbiased rating of 3star, only recommended for viewers that don't know what Resident Evil is.

4462603,1,B004SGWYW4,"I've heard a lot of things about High School of the Dead, but mostly how it's a combination of zombie horror and anime fan service. I wasn't really expecting anything good since a few respectable anime fans confirmed that I'd hate it, but out of morbid curiosity and the fact that I was able to watch this for free, I spend a day watching it and holy moly, this is among the worst of the worst in anime.

I loathe this so badly, I now consider it the second worst anime I've ever seen, right behind Elfen Lied.

STORY

High School of the Dead focuses on a group of teenagers in a high school that soon find themselves in the middle of a zombie outbreak in Japan. They must band together to survive and possibly even find the truth behind the zombie outbreak.

TONAL INCONSISTENCY

This is one of the most tonally-inconsistent anime titles I've ever seen in my life. The tonal inconsistency is the biggest ""death sentence"" for this anime. There's so many scenes in this anime that switch tones and visual styles at the drop of a hat. At one moment, you'll see really gruesome killings at the hands of zombies and right afterward, you'll see dumb, over-exaggerated faces, nosebleed gags, and way too much ecchi comedy. It's like the writers that created this anime couldn't decide between making a zombie series or a high school teenage dramedy, so they took the worst route imaginable and mashed the two together, and they mesh about as well as two ferocious streetdogs fighting for dumpster scraps.

I swear it's almost like the people who wrote this anime were trying to outdo Elfen Lied in terms of horrible tonal shifts. Among the worst examples of the bad tonal shifts is the episode where all the female characters bathe together and aren't the least bit hesitant to grab each others' unmentionables and spraying each other with shower heads. Aside from this not being sensually appealing or funny, it's followed by a man and his daughter trying to hide from the zombies, and the dad gets killed, followed with the girl crying over her dad's dead body. Another example of odd tonal shifts is that the nurse has a brief fantasy of herself as a maid cleaning her friend's apartment, which doesn't fit in with the fact that there's zombies all over the place, killing people. Even worse is that there cartoon-ish ""bouncing"" sound effects and other sound effects that are more appropriate for a Looney Tunes short than a ""mature"" anime centered around a zombie outbreak. The tonal shifts and changes in serious to silly visual styles harmed this anime so badly, that I was totally unengaged by anything else and was just waiting out until the end.

CHARACTERS

There was no creativity in the way the characters were made. None of them have much nuance beyond the most base stereotypes, and this makes them unlikeable and especially uninteresting. Among the worst characters in this anime is the nurse (characters are forgettable to the point of not remembering names). She's dumber than a coffee can full of nails and whines a lot about everything, yet the students take her with, despite the fact that's she's practically nothing but dead weight. This shows that this anime is without much logic, either, as the nurse is beyond stupid yet is somehow holding a job healing minor ailments that befall students at school. Another among the worst stereotypes is the chubby geek (I think his name is Kota), as he represents all the worst stereotypes of ostracized kids due to his unhealthy fixation on guns and his choice to wear black clothing. Easily among the most annoying characters is the pink-haired one, since she has an ego bigger than Kanye West's (she's always claiming to be a genius) yet proves to be useless in 99% of the anime, and is further damaged for the fact that she's just a cookie-cutter caricature of over-achieving honor students (uptight, belittling others, and constantly harping over her intellectual prowess).

PRETENTIOUSNESS

Aside from the fact that this anime is rampant with bad tonal shifts, it also doesn't help that in terms of its themes and overall story, it wants to have its cake and eat it, too. So much of the time is spent in this anime trying to be a constant vehicle for fanservice to appeal to teenage male anime fans, yet there's hints of it trying to be higher than what it is as it also tries to make commentary about whether or not the real monsters are the humans or zombies (highlighted by the hysterical school teacher who tries to form a cult with some of the surviving students). Instead of adding depth to the anime, it just feels like tacked-on social commentary thrown in there to make this anime seem smarter than it really is.

This anime goes even further into pretentious territory where there's a segment that tries to tie in the storyline of this anime with Mutiny on the Bounty. This scene didn't make the anime anymore ""artistically-developed,"" but just trying too hard to be more than something stupid.

LACK OF ORIGINALITY

One of the things that struck me the most about High School of the Dead is that it's nothing but a salad bowl of all the most base cliches from the anime genre.

Lots of jejune violence? Check.
Majority of female characters are schoolgirls? Check.
Unimaginative character personalities? Check.
Lots of unfunny ecchi comedy? Check.
Half-baked storyline? Check.
Lots of redundant fanservice? Double check.
Half-baked ending? Check.

It's apparent that none of the people who made this anime wanted to make something that was a labor of love or to add anything of artistic merit to the anime genre. They just looked at all the most lucrative aspects to anime and mashed them together.

ACTION SCENES

With this being an anime that's supposed to be heavy on zombie-slaying action, this didn't deliver at all. Despite the plentiful action scenes, the absolute dearth of quality character development or character personalities stripped away all tension in these scenes. The way these scenes are made are so predictable, as there's plenty of scenes where you think one of the main characters is going to get eaten by the zombies, there's a ""deus ex machina"" moment where the zombie(s) in question get slain before they can infect one of the main characters. I should have kept count when these scenes occurred, but there's more than enough to take away any tension. Not that this would have helped out a lot since the clashing tones damage this anime beyond repair, but it would have helped if the writers were more creative and had one or two of the main characters die off. I should also point out how absurd some of the action scenes are, since there's a scene where one of the guys runs out of ammo during a fight with the zombies and grabs the brown-haired girl's gun, but because of the strap attached to her, he has to push her down and sandwich his arms between her chest. Does there really need to be this much blatant fanservice? I rolled my eyes at least twice when this occurred.

BAD HUMOR

Now you must be saying ""Can't you just get over yourself and enjoy the action and ecchi humor for what it is?"" I answer with a gigantic ""NO!"" The humor in this totally lacks creativity, since these types of ecchi jokes have been repeated ad nauseum in previous anime, and they don't do any good (especially for folks like me, who have a giant disdain for anime comedy as it is). If I wanted humor, I'll go watch some Angry Grandpa videos or Dumb and Dumber. Speaking of that, I swear there was a gag that was ripped off from that hilarious movie. There's a scene where the group leader saves a little girl from the zombies and is carrying her on his back, and she has to go to the bathroom, and because she couldn't hold it in, she wets herself and the guy's back. That scene was funny in Dumb and Dumber, but not in this.

APPEARANCE

The animation and artwork certainly had a lot of time and effort put into it, but good visuals alone NEVER make a worthwhile anime. Despite being a huge technical achievement, this is easily Madhouse's worst creation thus far. To think the same studio that cranked out Perfect Blue and Battle Angel also made this.

SOUNDTRACK

The background music in this anime was pretty forgettable, and the music in the intro wasn't any good. It's just pop-rock that doesn't fit at all with an anime centered around an apocalyptic zombie attack.

MATURE CONTENT

There's a great deal of gore in this anime. There's plenty of bloodshed and of people getting eaten by zombies, and even some dismemberment. The nudity and sensual content isn't at all extreme for me, since there weren't any female parts totally exposed, as the animators were chickens and conveniently covered up any private areas, in which the scenes are as absurd as the comedic censoring in the Austin Powers movies.

Since there's so many scenes with fanservice and absurd female behavior, this anime totally reeks of misogyny (no points were added or deducted for allegations of misogyny, these are merely observations), yet I'd bet a dozen Snickers bars that the anime fans gushing over High School of the Dead would quickly smash Doomed Megalopolis for allegations of misogynistic content.

FINAL WORD

If you're looking for Japanese animation to feed into your most personal fantasies of women, man up and get some Bible Black DVDs instead (or watch BB on the internet). Bible Black goes all the way with its ""mature content"" and as a whole, is much more enjoyable than HOTD since even though its animated erotica, it still manages to maintain a pretty serious, consistent tone and with semi-competent story and character development.

If you want adult anime containing artistic merit, check these titles out instead.

Everyday is the same old same old. But suddenly he comes face to face with an unbelievable situation: a zombie apocalypse. Takashi forms a group with his friends and must think smart if they want to survive.

This show is one of my favorites. It's got everything a guy wants; zombies, guns, boobs, chicks! It has a great plot and the characters fit nicely with each other.  This anime really actually makes you think, what would i do if this happened to me? This anime captures many realistic elements. Even though this story is kind of dark, it has a lot of humor. It has a lot of ""fan service"" but i cant complain im a guy so haha. You learn to get used it. Some others think that this show could have been better with out it, but in my opinion thats what makes it unique. The Blu-Ray really makes this anime shine. The drawings are crisp and clear. The soundtrack to this show is also adds a nice touch. The opening song is one of my favorite. The collection includes two Blu-Ray disks with all 12 episodes. Some extras are included such as clean openings/endings and the ability to change to the japanese voice actors. I would NOT recommend this show to anyone under 16 due to the scenes of sexual content.

4462609,3,B004SGWYW4,"As a female, I might be a little biased, but the main thing that irked me in this series is they made all the females stupid, big-breasted, men-dependent, and annoying. Also, there's a yuri-like scene in episode 6 where all the girls are grabbing each other's abnormally large breasts and they all somehow get drunk and flirt with the main character. Overall, the females are totally unrealistic in all means. I know anime is almost never realistic by any means but there's a difference having one stupid big-breasted female than them all being stupid and big-breasted. Also, come on! It's a zombie apocalypse and they're all wearing little to almost no clothing at all! One can tell this show was targeted for teenage boys.

Another bad thing is that the characters are kind of shallow. You don't really bond with them at all like in other animes and they're forgettable. However, this might be because the anime is so short (only 12 episodes).

One highlight is the animation; the animation is surprisingly really good. The characters are drawn really well!

But to the point, the main reason I gave this a three-star is due to my love of zombie movies; that's what attracted me to this anime in the first place. I know zombies are all pretty much cliche but there's just some times when I feel like watching a good ol' zombie flick. This anime is perfect for that - lots of gore and zombie fighting action. In this anime, there's a little twist though, the zombies can only hear although the characters just keep on talking and yelling and the zombies walk around as if they heard nothing. I guess they're a little hard-of-hearing (haha).

Overall, HOTD is perfect for ""light watching"" (example, a rainy day and you're just sitting around in the house), but if you're looking for a meaningful and/or memorable anime, this isn't it. Hope my review helped a little!",1341100800,5,1866,4.7323076923076925

4462613,2,B004SGWYW4,"High School of the Dead is a REALLY campy zombie anime. It has a fair amount of impressive drawing, but the plot leaves a lot to be desired. Though you may say, ""what do you expect from a fan-service anime based on zombies""? The thing is, they obviously put thought into *parts* of the anime, and then ignored that thought for other parts, and their timing REALLY has issues.

For example with consistancy: There is one scene where they're trying to figure out how the zombies work for finding their prey, and find they're completely sound-based, and will chase after even a dropped shoe or light metal tap. Later on, they're having a party, and zombies don't do much, and later, a dog is barking in the middle of a crowd of zombies and they completely ignore it, walking past it. To gather outside of a house that is (at that time) relatively quiet. Oh, and they regularly go after one gunshot when elsewhere there's lots of gunshots.

For example with plot: The more intelligent member of the group at one points begins questioning how the zombies function... is a virus, is it living dead, is it some kind of military weapon.... and..... nothing ever comes of that question. Ever.

For example with timing: *spoiler alert* There is a REALLY dramatic scene where a small child's father is brutally murdered right in front of her in an act of desperation. It is probably one of the saddest and emotional parts of the entire show... and it's almost immediately cut off with fan-service with silly boinging noises.

The thing is, the anime keeps showing it *could* be deep. At multlpe points, it starts to broach deeper topics about the zombie apocalypse... and then immediately ruins it or just conveniently forgets it a short bit later. It wold have been better if it had developed those points, or at least never hinted it could consider being deep in the first place.",1336694400,11,1870,4.674772036474164

4462622,3,B004SGWYW4,"I didn't watch it all. I have seen only 3 episodes. I couldn't get passed the fact of how bad this show is.

 I'm your average male. Aged 19. I am what many people would call a hipster (i prefer less popular items and shows/music then most people) so take that for what it is in this review.

 I've liked anime for many years. I have also liked zombies for many years. When i heard they were making a zombie anime i was ecstatic. I watched the first episode the day it aired. I continued on for the following 2 weeks. After that i just couldn't continue.

 Let me get this out of the way. I'm a liberal. I strongly believe in human rights. One of my main beliefs is equality between races, genders, and social groups. This show frankly shows everything wrong with the current anime industry. Anime has lost it's art form and meaning. It's lost plot and character development. It's turned into a fan service mess. Why did this happen? the fans of anime have demanded moe characteristics and fan service for many years. Looking at animes over 10 years old these rarely existed. there may have been nudity but it wasn't sexual in any nature. Sure some did but they were the minority. being a humanist i strongly believe people should be treated equally. In our current society women are still deemed as sex objects. This show turns them into such sex objects. it even shows behavior unlikely to ever occur in real life. This show isn't just gory (i like gore) and full of panty shots and boob shots it is also offensive and degrading to women anywhere. When will our society learn.

 In conclusion this show is practically everything wrong with the current anime industry and is one of the prime reasons i will never wear anime as a badge of pride in public. I don't want to be thought of as some kind of pervert.

4462623,4,B004SGWYW4,"To some people, anime is a genre filled with graphic violence, unnecessary sex, gratuitous nudity, and girls with big breasts, ripped-off clothing, and skimpy underwear.  HOTD will fully live up to - or down to - these stereotypes.  It is also 12 episodes of guilty pleasure, with zombies.

For some unexplained reason, a plague has broken out all over the world, that turns people into ""them"". (The word ""zombie"" is never used)  But ""they"" shamble around, make weird noises, and bite people, their bite being rapidly fatal.  This doesn't end the story, because it seems that zombies, like Mormons, have the ability to convert the dead.  So the plague grows exponentially, and chaos ensues.

When a local high school becomes infected, the intrepid survivors break free in the school bus, and search for friends, family and sanctuary, in a horror-comedic race against time (and, of course, zombies).  Most of the episodes follow a band of six escapees: the useless school nurse, who seems to exist only to rub her assets against everyone else; the spoiled rich girl who shouts a lot and keeps her hair impeccably groomed, and four kids who can fight, including a dark-haired kendo girl who acts like a demented Aoyama Motoko and whom I found the most engaging of the bunch.  There are also some amusing cameos poking fun at Japanese culture.

There is no real closure: the show just sort of stops, so perhaps there will be a sequel.  However, my copy differed a little from the Amazon data given above.  Its aspect ratio is not 4:3, but 16:9.  It is rated locally as NC-16, which I think is about right.  And there is at least one ""edited"" version out there, so before you buy check that every episode is exactly 24 minutes long.",1332115200,3,1728,4.735785953177258

If you are a fan of the Zombie genre, then you absolutely have to take a look, at the outstanding HSotD. The Anime, one of the most faithful Manga adaptations I've seen, will blow you away.

This series ruined the Walking Dead for me, because the characters have time to have emotional break downs, they take reasonable and prudent precautions, they run experiments on the zombies, they plan their actions in order to stay alive, and they learn from their mistakes.
Yes, there are gags in there for hormonal boys. Yes, there are large, jiggling breasts, and gratuitous panty flashing, but the characters and story are strong enough, that these things are just icing on the cake.

I have loaned this out to anime-hating, diehard zombie geeks, who downed the whole thing in one or two sittings, and were begging for more. One friend of mine watched the first two episodes in Japanese, because his player defaulted to that. Now Shane doesn't speak a word of Japanese, but he got so caught up in what was going on, that he didn't turn on the subs, or switch to English, he just called to tell me how cool it was!

Be very sure to stick with it through the end credits, and not zip off to the next episode. I made that mistake, discovered it 5 episodes in when I let an episode play and grabbed a drink, and had to go back and correct my oversight. After the credits there's a few minutes more story that helps lead into the next episode, and they don't re-cap it all. You snooze, you lose.

Geek that I am, I watched these in subtitled Japanese first, and then switched to English dubbing, and both are very well done.

My only complaints are the lack of more bonus material, and that the OVA, fan service special, was not included. (and that we don't have season 2 yet)",1328745600,2,1792,4.451219512195122

Pros:
1) Great engaging story line
2) Action is good
3) I liked this universe's zombies.
4) I loved how the characters took a more pragmatic approach to the zombie invasion. One of the things I cannot stand about The Walking Dead is how ridiculous and emotional the characters can be.
5) The imagery, specifically at the high school, was at times frightening.

Cons:
1) Fanservice. It was too much at times that it often took away from the horror of what was happening. There was also absoluetly no male fan service for us female viewers.
2) Some of the characters are very cliche. Did this show really need a dumb, no absolutely stupid blond girl? Saeko could also use more development. I'm tired of cold blooded action girls.
3) Stop making Rei a damsel. Yeah she gets her moments to shine, but it gets tiresome to see her always needing help when the other characters can handle themselves just fine.

4462636,5,B004SGWYW4,"HOTD, wow.  Okay HOTD really has a pretty good story.  I'll be honest, I really really was looking to critisise it, looking at the cover and the comments, I really just thought it was just boobs.  I found it hard to believe that the artist and his brother, the writer, whose a hentai artist, would be able to produce something thats meaningful or interesting.  I mean seriously, as much as we all really love boobs, its not worth it if all 12 episodes have no story.  I just thought it was zombies dying and boobs.  I WAS WRONG.
Story:(reason I would give this 5 stars)
The characters all complement each other well and each character goes through his or her own personal journey.  This first 12 episodes really helps slowly develop relations and define faults of each character.  It does this through serious and humorous tones.  All the episodes have a decent amount of zombie action but it slowly develops more(using the fact that more people get infected over time.)  Another strong point about this anime is that it focuses on the big picture.  It focuses on a societal collapse and what a country, or what humanity will do depending on the circumstances.  This is a strong strong point for me.  Though the characters are very interesting and I love them, I want to know what happens to the HOTD world as a whole.  Why things happen, what responses will occur, and what happens if they fail.  Very strong story.

Anime:
Since I'm a huge fan of Bandai, (Gundam, evangelion,) I read a lot of their mangas and watch a lot of their Animes.  First thing I noticed when I watched this was the quality of its animation.  Not saying that Bandai does bad anime, but this seems cleaner, CGI, perhaps I've been watching slightly older Gundam series recently so it might just be a matter of old and new.  However, its very clean, very nice.  I've always been more of a story guy so I don't really mind the quality but this is a good addition.

Intangibles:
Boobs, Boobs, Boobs.  Sometimes, its really too much, I get it that its there to keep a light tone in the story, and sometimes it works well.  But sometimes, it gets slightly distracting, especially the Nurse.  I find the rest okay because they tie in well to certain situations, but I guess I like Animes that are kind of serious and so it gets distracting.  However, it does really work well for some episodes and when its there on purpose, FANTASTIC.

The first time I saw the cover, I was extremely skeptical, firstly High school, secondly the drawings.  I had extreme doubts that this could surpass 3 stars and anything above 3 stars was because of boobs.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and I've been finding myself wanting more.  Thank you HOTD, you did a great job and in my opinion, found a strong balance between humor and serious-ness.  I can't wait for SEASON 2!",1325808000,,2829,4.566600397614314

4462638,5,B004SGWYW4,"Awesome show.  While there may be a little too much emphasis on boobs and underwear for my liking, there are enough action-packed and serious scenes to help balance that minor flaw out.

4462641,5,B004SGWYW4,"I first watched High School of the Dead in Japanese and eagerly awaited its English dub. I had to wait until Christmas to find a copy locally and then wait until Christmas day to unwrap it. Yesterday i watched the whole series with a friend who had never seen it before. Needless to say we both enjoyed it. HOTD is a Zombie Apocalypse story surrounding Takashi Komuro and his High School friends as they try to survive the sudden and horrifying zombie outbreak. This is a first as Zombies are a popular cult icon in America, I don't believe there has ever been an anime like this.
  Borrowing from the already established zombie mythos, HOTD adds typical anime/manga style action and flare to the realism of a zombie apocalypse that has suddenly gripped not just Japan, but the entire world. Takashi and his friends find themselves battling their way through hordes of the undead in an attempt to find their families. Starting in the confines of a high school at the start of the infection,then to the streets of Japan, HOTD gives you a wide variety of locations for the story to pan out. With action, blood, gore, and fan service galore HOTD is anime that will have you wanting to watch all 12 episodes in one sitting.
  I only had one problem with the English dub, and that was the Americanization. though it was easily overlooked due to the great voice cast and the already wonderful anime, as i had already seen the series in Japanese with English subtitles mentions of ""Wal-Mart Cheetos"", ""Mel Gibson Movies"", and ""Dior skirts"" had me face palming. Americanization in anime has slowed down in the past few years, but it always seemed small. Though Wal-Mart is found just about everywhere it is most prevalent in the United States. Because of this when you hear these bits of American culture thrown in you find yourself forgetting these characters are supposed to be in Japan and not in the States. As i said it plays a very small part in the series, except for the addition of extra curse words that you would expect a rebellious American youth to shout under duress, so the story tends to drown it out.
  All in all, HOTD is great anime with tons of action and scares alike. the English and Japanese voice casts are both very talented and bring life to the characters. You will find yourself caring about Takashi and his friends every time a zombie pops up with its teeth bared. The story is solid and the action is intense. If your a fan of zombies, horror, sexy animated girls, or just an anime junkie like myself, then you cannot miss High School of the Dead.",1324944000,3,2569,4.573913043478261

4462644,2,B004SGWYW4,"First of all, I will say the artwork and anime design in this movie are top notch, although I'd seen scenes of zombies attacking and eating humans that were better designed and drawn out in todays video games than presented here in this film. And although I've outgrown my desire for slasher films and Friday 13th type movies, I did realize what this film was about going in. I purchased it, however, hoping that there would be plenty of nudity and aberrant sex scenes thrown in to add to the mix and make up for all the other gory parts of the story.

 Unfortunately, it wasn't to be. And not being so inclined, I don't feel the need to spend time watching teaser films either, hoping as I was that this film was going to be a bit more than that.

Something else I disliked about this film was the frequent number of times it went off into song. This was most disconcerting and annoying, and totally extraneous and unnecessary to the storyline. I mean, I understand music backing up the action of the story, yes, and background music. But stopping the story and going off into this interlude several times just to break out into some type of quasi-rock song only to then go back to the action of the movie...Really aggravating.

So, this is a mixed review. Personally, I didn't care for the movie, but then I have rather eclectic tastes as far as anime films go, running toward the more hard core, and either reviewers didn't expound enough in their reviews to give me a clearer picture of what I was in for once I committed myself to purchasing this film, or I missed the ones that would have guided me where I needed to go.

There is no nudity until very late in the series, only teasing up-skirt and busty clothed boob shots throughout most of the film, as we watch the youngsters run for their lives trying to escape the zombies death grip. If you're looking for nudity and sex, look elsewhere, If you like the teasing and soft-porn style this movie presents, then you will definitely like this film.",1323734400,3,2005,4.482191780821918

Once I figured that out the movie took on a whole new perspective. A great homage to 28 Days/Weeks ...

As far as the animation, to me anime is visually boring with a flat simplistic non-changing background coupled with a single, sometimes moving and sometimes not moving, animation in the foreground I thought that these animators were effective in conveying the story given the limitations of the medium.",1323043200,,689,5.043859649122807
4462649,3,B004SGWYW4,"let me start out by saying if you are a boy who is 18 or under, this series is for you. its got well animated action sequences, blood all over the place, and giant bouncy boobs plus panty shots every 5 seconds. i gave this 3 stars, but you would give it 5. you guys are young, you don't want to think to hard when you watch something. so watch this, i know you will love it. also, if you wait after the credits of the last episode, they even hint at a second season...zomb-gasm!!!

for all you guys who are in your early 20's or older and are not young at heart, then this will probably just be an average piece of media to you. you've all seen hundreds of action movies in your youth and action doesnt get you pumped like it used to and blood isn't shocking anymore. since your hormones aren't out of control anymore, sexual content every 5 seconds is just annoying. the story has its unique parts, but mostly you know whats going to happen. that guys going to die, this guys going to live, the groups current headquarters are going to be invaded by zombies. as adults, we just know whats going to happen.

as a man in my early 20's who doesnt even watch super hero movies anymore, i have rated this 3 stars. like i said, its not completly unoriginal. i wanted to finish this series just to figure out the small things i couldn't guess. some people i obviously knew were going to die, but some i didnt. even if i watch a movie and can guess 99% of the outcome, i still finish it to figure out that 1%. its how i work. but if your not like me, and your looking for a story filled adventure where you have no idea whats going to happen next, this isn't for you.

now listen carefully, all you who are not of man flesh, for this series is NOT for you. maybe, if your a female 18 or younger who enjoys action like the boys of your same age do, you might give this 2 stars. simply because you enjoy the action, but if you watch this, you will be HORRIFIED by how much they toy with women in this series, unless your a lesbian. they make it look like the word girls is just japanese for sex, and ive seen anime do it before, BUT NOT LIKE THIS!!! to you, the sexual content just might be more scary then the zombies.

if your a mature, pure girl who is in her early 20's or older, DONT WATCH THIS SHOW. just give it 1 slut of a star and never watch it.

p.s. this is my first review ive ever made for anything on amazon. i hope it was helpful, and i hope that no one was offended by my silly, crude, jokes. for all i know, amazon could delete this review by tommorow morning=)",1322870400,,2570,4.091269841269841

It is, but as far as the genre goes, it's pretty darn good. The standard zombie rules apply, with some new twists. The guys are mostly natural zombie killers. The girls fall in to two classes: Brazier busting bazongas that are useless in a fight (bouncy eye candy) and Brazier busting bazongas that are phenomenal in a fight (even bouncier eye candy). Seriously.

The zombie fight scenes are cool - this is Anime like Romero would do Anime. Most parts are pretty darn realistic, even if the girls are really, er, rhymes with twitchy.

The survivors band together to fight off the zombies with various weapons....the plot is not that original besides the fact that this takes place at a school instead of a mall.

4462657,2,B004SGWYW4,"High school of the dead is an anime that I heard an endless amount of hype over. I started watching it b/c it is close to Halloween, and I thought I knew what I was getting into. I started out thinking it was like every horror movie, but in anime form. I love horror movies, so I was actually impressed. The animation was fluid and colorful, and I was just so entertained by the first few episodes.
Then, the show stopped being about zombies. It became, how close can we get to porn, w/o it actually being porn? It was trash. Sure there were a few flashes of entertainment, and the last episode was pretty exciting, but overall it was smut. It included all the tropes of modern anime, even a moe character, who thankfully wasn't too cute or anything, but there was an awkward scene where she took a whiz on the main character...just creepy.
Honestly, I'm just disappointed b/c it started out so entertaining, and just strayed in a bizarre direction. I wouldn't watch this again.:(

To give credit where credit is due I'd have to mention the background animation was stunning. I enjoy massive gore in a zombie flick as  much as the next horror fanatic but the humor and fan service totally tipped the scales and I personally lost interest mid-series.

If you want to watch naked boobs, big boobs, panties, there are a lot of websites out there you can jack it to. For god sakes, if you want toons with boobs and hot girls, Japan makes that too, it's called hentai. Leave porn to porn and tv shows to tv shows. Nothing against a little fanservice as long as the show doesn't go out of its way for it. This though, is ridiculous. Its entire plot is based around fanservice.",1318377600,13,727,4.090909090909091
4462660,4,B004SGWYW4,"I have to admit when I first heard about this series I was a bit skeptical. I thought it was riding the huge wave known as the zombie craze in 2009 when Zombieland and Left 4 Dead 2 came out. The reason why I eventually watched this series was because a friend of mine asked about HOTD's future as an anime. From watching this series I have to say its a pretty well thought out zombie scenario (if it happened in Japan anyways). The story follows a group of students, the school nurse, a young child and some random dog as they desparately survive the mysterious zombie outbreak.

From the get go the series seems like standard zombie movie plot, but it goes a little beyond that. HOTD shows the merciless slaughter of the living by the dead, the despiration of the living, and psychological derangement that could possibly happen in such an incident. The series produced by Madhouse (Death Note, Gunslinger Girl, Black Lagoon) and directed by the same guy who directed Black Lagoon. So if you enjoyed Black Lagoon, you might enjoy HOTD since they kind of have the same feel when you watch it. By far the biggest thing people complain/put off by in this series is the oversaturation of fan service. There are a lot of boob and pany shots to the point where if you hate it you'll want 24 minutes of your life back after watching one episode. Personally the fan service wasn't that bad, because I've watched other series where it completely ruined the series to the point where there was no plot anymore *points finger at Kampfer and Ikki Tousen. In the case of HOTD does it make you take the plot less seriously, at times yes, but is that plot lost because of it? No.

This set is uncut, so if you watched it on the animenetwork there are no black shades over some violent parts. If you don't believe me that its uncut then episode 6 will make it painfully obvious (watch and find out). I think the only glaring flaw is the translation of one character's name, I read the manga and it annoys the hell out of me (Arisu, when its Alice). Aside from that I throughly enjoyed the series. I would give it five stars, but it gets four because the series ends so abruptly. Though to be fair its only because the manga is still ongoing. To me I enjoyed the dark plot and because of it I bought it to show my support and perhaps bring about a second season. So if you can wade through the fan service and if you want to enjoy a good zombie series HOTD is definitely worth looking into.",1318291200,4,2475,4.378260869565217
4462661,5,B004SGWYW4,"I've known about the High School of the Dead Manga since I was in High School.  I never read it though other than a quick summary of the story.  I thought it sounded interesting but I never followed up on it.  Just a few months ago I saw the entire show and was amazed at how good the story is.

First off let me say that yes, the circumstances are ridiculous (2 average dudes traveling with 4 INSANELY hot babes) but isn't that every high school kids fantasy?  A zombie apocalypse where the women outnumber the men in the group and they all fight over you?  Sounds good to me.

The only bad thing I have to say about this show is the amount of ""fan service"" that is displayed.  We get far too MANY shots of boobs jiggling, panty shots, and stupid situations in which boobs are somehow the focus.  If they had been more subtle with that then this show would have been perfect.

In one of the episodes you have the 2 main guys in one room talking about guns and loading them up, while the 4 girls are in the bathroom bathing together and grabbing each others tits.  Then they walk around the apartment either naked, or wearing nothing but an apron while acting VERY horny and stoned trying to hit on the main character.  He of course is shocked like very other damn anime character is in these shows and denies their advances, opting to tuck them into bed so that he can go snipe out some zombies.

I realize this defines a lot of male fantasies but it's done in such a blatant way that I can't help but shake my head and blush when I watch this.

As far as the characters go I think they are well developed.  The main guy is your average slacker with hidden potential that most of the girls want when the shiz hits the fan.  The second dude is you typical fat geek who happens to be obsessed with guns and is an expert in their use.  He's probably the most useful character in battle.  The 4 women are: The ditsy nurse with the ENORMOUS rack.  She's the only adult in the group.  Then there's the main girl, she's basically the main love interest of the main character, she's hot, well balanced, has drama...etc.  The third girl is the red/pink headed smart rich girl of the group.  She seems to be a potential love interest for the fat gun nerd.  And finally the fourth girl is the samurai girl, who is the best hand to hand combat character in the group.  She's the most serious of all the females and is probably in competition with the main girl for the main guys man juices.

The characters are fun and the show is entertaining.  A fine addition to the ever growing zombie culture.

I rate this show 5 stars despite the embarrassing fan service.  If you like zombies, guns, hot anime girls, and drama then you will like this show.",1317945600,,2735,4.2890625

No real extras,no art cards, no slip cover, no nothing! For such a fun and great series they should be ashamed of themselves. This ""complete"" collection doesn't do this series justice at all. As much as this ""collection"" costs I expected a lot more. I've paid less for other series and they put out collections really worth buying.

 Lets all be honest here, as fans of anime when you buy a series you're obviously doing so because you really enjoyed the show. Of course it be nice if they threw in extra perks with these collections to make it feel like it's a purchase worth your while. With the option of watching shows streamed online anytime what reason would there be to buy DVD or Blue Ray? You would think these companies figured out people that buy the DVD's want more from it.

4462668,2,B004SGWYW4,"Do you like tits? That is the first thing you should ask before watching this series.  True, there are zombies in there, but they take a back seat to girls panties.  Also, the zombies are retarded.  Not MINDLESSLY retarded, mind you, but the set of rules set up to govern how the zombies hunt is retarded.  More specifically, how it's brought up that they can't see, smell, or feel anything, relying entirely on hearing to catch their prey... and then the second a character sees a zombie they just start screaming.

Also, they are not called zombies.  Their logic is that while they 'act and move like zombies, this is not a movie, so they are not zombies'.  This anime is a hodgepodge of mixed messages: one moment it demands you take it seriously, showing people (mostly underage girls who manage to flash their underwear at LEAST once in the process) getting eaten by zombies in painful and apparently erotic ways (?).  Then they have girls wet down their shirts and dance around with their tits flapping about unimpeded by gravity or physics.  It goes from them riding around a deserted Tokyo suburb at night while a radio station blares eerily in the background, then instantly has the girl molested (in a close up of her boobs, nonetheless) and we are expected to feel worried about her.  We MIGHT feel tension in this scene if the 3 episodes before it hadn't take great pleasure in extreme fan service as it was.  By the time the attempted rape happens we just don't care.  Also, she's a bitch.

Hey, speaking of character development, guess which anime has NONE! If you guessed this one, then congratulations, you recognized you were reading a review for Highschool of the Dead and put two and two together.  It also means you are smarter than most of the characters in this series.  Each girl has the same personality with pretty much only one difference between them.  One girl with pink hair and big boobs keeps spouting on and on about how she's such a genius, talking about facts she doesn't even get right (never brought up though, just the author being a lazy idiot) and a few things that anybody with half a brain could figure out.  The girl with big boobs and brown hair is thoroughly unlikeable - she spends the first episode going on and on at the main character about how the guy she's dating is super smart and always right and how she vastly prefers him over the main guy.  Then her boyfriend dies and pretty much the very next episode she's trying to have sex with the main protagonist.  She's also totally useless.  There's a woman with GIANT BOOBS as her main personality.  In fact, her boobs are so big I'm convinced they drain her intellect because she is literally the STUPIDEST character I've ever seen EVER.  I want to punch the screen whenever she appears.  Plus she's a doctor.  Don't ask, she never uses that skill.  The only girl who doesn't make me mad is the kendo girl with big boobs, who kills zombies with swords and likes it.  That's her only trait.  Also, there's a guy who's perfect in every way except for being bad at school which oh hey how about that is now overrun with zombies and totally irrelevent.  He's boring, irritating after a while, and everybody loves him.  The only character I like is the fat nerd who's good at only one thing: SHOOTING ZOMBIES.  When he's not shooting things he's quiet, reserved, and incredibly shy.  Give him a rifle and he's the cockiest character in the show, and so enthusiastic about it.  Oh, and there's this one INSANELY obvious slimey character, who kills a kid in front of everybody, keeps licking his lips around the girls, and overexaggerates all his motions.  Now, in real, logical society NOBODY would trust him for a moment.  But this is HotD.  EVERYBODY who's not a main character not only trusts him explicitly the second he arrives, but actually FAWN OVER HIM.  Ugh, my head hurts from rage.  Where'd I keep my aspirin....

Let's see, what else is wrong with the show? Oh yeah, how about logic?  They have this tendency to, in an attempt to make it realistic, explain things to an excessive degree in an attempt to make it believable.  Then they totally ignore said thing and go ahead with it.  Example? ""Oh, I can't drive a bus! I'm not trained, it's different from a car! Also, if I hit too many zombies the bus will flip!"" 30 seconds later she drives it over about 50 zombies, THROUGH AN IRON GATE, and drives it perfectly away like nothing was wrong.  Also, remember the zombies only being able to hear? Well in one episode they try to distract them by banging on pipes, and when the zombies don't come they ask 'why won't they come to us?'.  Never answered.  Then, the very next episode, the zombies find them for NO REASON, and the characters ask 'how did they find us? Was it the LEAVES IN THE TREE?'.  Just let that soak in.  Zombies track people by listening to leaves in trees.  I'm pretty sure that counts as magic.

But the series isn't ALL bad.  The animation is very smooth and detailed, capturing the zombies and atmosphere (sans the boob shots) almost perfectly.  The music is great, and at least they have a firm understanding on jiggle physics.  But is it a good series? ...Seriously? Are you asking that after reading this entire review?  Never mind, you're not smarter than the zombies.  Good luck against the blind mute guys who can't feel.

Seriously though, this series CAN be fun under the right circumstances.  Want to play an awesome drinking game? Any time you see boobs or panty shots (or, if you wish to not die from alcohol poisoning, just panty shots).  If you drag a friend in with you, you can have fun mocking it relentlessly.  And if you're a hopeless pervert who likes to watch underage girls bounce around braless or watch girls get eaten in their underwear, then this series is also for you.  Or, if you think logic is for other people, then you might like it too.  If you're the kind of person who liked The Room or Troll 2 for how hilariously bad it was, you could come away from this grinning like an idiot and telling your friends about it.  If you're looking for a serious watch though, you'd get a more serious, logical story out of Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland.  And at least those movies are GOOD.",1315440000,7,6242,4.5443946188340805
4462669,1,B004SGWYW4,"Fan Service and zombies. That's all this show is. So I suppose that any review has to cover both of them. Ladies first I guess.

The opening titles alone has a dozen crotch and boob shots. None of them serve any purpose. Throughout the show you are constantly plastered with this given the slightest opportunity. Or even when they have to create an opportunity. The number of dialogue scenes where the camera slowly goes down to focus on their panties averages out to at least two an episode. Probably more. The worst episode by far is episode six. In it the girls all bathe together, with predictable fondling and lesbianism, while the two guys sit in the other room and talk about guns. That's the whole episode right there. Oh, except for the fact that all the girls try to sleep with the main guy. I'm assuming that they got drunk somewhere in there because they all act it after the bath. Either it's just assumed or that's just how this guy thinks girls act when they let their crazy feminine emotions out.

This is symptomatic of the treatment of the girls in general throughout the series. All of the girls (with one exception) offer nothing but an opportunity to show off their bodies. There are four main girls. I can't be bothered to remember their names so I'll just identify them by their hair color. Pink is a total b*tch. She says she's a genius at every possible opportunity although she never demonstrates any proof of it (many of her 'facts' are wrong and the ones that are right she cannot possibly know), and she enjoys belittling people for it. The blonde girl is a complete bimbo. She's the school nurse but she has giant breasts and the IQ of a five year old. She never speaks except to whine or fawn all over the main character who is I might point out, actually an underage student. I suspect she works at a high school for a very specific reason... Brown hair is also obnoxious and likes to go on about how great the guy's friend was even though he's still traumatized from killing him. At one point she's thrown from a car and she just lies there for at least 3-4 hours (it goes from midday to sunset) while everyone else protects her. She's not hurt or anything, she just gets up and walks it off. Naturally she's the main love interest. The last girl is purple haired and she's the only semi-good one. She's a master with swords and genuinely loves killing zombies. Her competence and professionalism do not prevent her from being used as yet another sex doll for them to display. It is made quite clear that even the competent girl can do nothing without a guy to lead her. More than that the girls cannot think for themselves and constantly put everyone's lives in danger because of their uncontrolled emotions and lusts. It really is a disgustingly misogynistic and exploitative show.

So now the zombies. Zombies are cool right? How can they mess them up? Well first off they never call them zombies. They seem to think this makes them realistic somehow. Secondly they bind them with stupid rules and then constantly break them. These zombies are cannot see, smell or touch. The only sense they have is hearing. Sounds interesting right? So naturally they'll be quiet and sneak around to prevent the zombies from hearing them. Except they don't. They run around screaming with zombies all around ignoring them and then one of them will bump into a pole, or drop a bat, or the wind in the trees will make noise and suddenly the zombies are attacking them everywhere. I want you to think hard about that last one. The wind in the trees attracted the zombies. THE WIND IN THE FRIGGIN' TREES!!!!!! So having established by the second episode that zombies need sound to hunt they then proceed to ignore it until it is convenient to the show for them to be in danger. How can there be any actual sense of danger when they ignore their own rules when it's convenient?

The two guys are there too. That's really all that can be said of them. The main guy is basically how the author views the perfect guy to be. He has no real flaws and is fawned over to an obscene degree by all the women. The other guy is a fat nerd and a gun buff. He's probably the most interesting character there since he's extremely competent at one thing and enjoys it immensely. Naturally he's treated with nothing but contempt by all the girls who are nothing if not superficial.

So, the good things...

I'm drawing a blank here. I suppose that technically it's an impressive film. The animation is quite good and the character designs aren't that bad. The main theme's pretty catchy too. Apart from that zip. Zilch. Nada. This show has no redeeming features whatsoever. I suppose that if you're a 12-year-old boy or can't figure out how to search for hentai on the internet this might be a good show for you.",1315440000,26,4819,4.52812858783008

I like the zombies and I believe it is pretty accurate in what would happen during the beginning out a zombie outbreak.  I personally liked the voice acting and the action is top notch.  I like the characters and they all add something to the mix of the story.  My only issue is the placement of the breasts in the story.  It does distract from the overall story and if someone would go back and redo it and take out 90 percent of the breast shots, which would still leave enough for the average person it would be a whole lot better.  I do understand the audience the story tell was aiming for and while I don't understand all of the Japanese culture I do understand a lot.  The person was trying to aim for two audiences and should have only tried for one.  In my case the zombie audience would have been it.  Still worth a watch though and I personally think the pros out weigh the cons by a lot.",1315180800,2,1167,4.115044247787611
4462671,4,B004SGWYW4,"High School of the dead is a little bit of a misleading name, as the majority of the series doesn't actually take place in a high school, albeit most of the characters are related to the high school in one fashion or another.

This is your basic zombie apocalypse story delivered as anime. It consists of all the things you expect from this kind of story, gore, blood, human interaction, mental breakdowns, and nudity. In all reality, HOTD has a lot less nudity than some anime I have watched in recent months, only consisting of a single episodes with anything of the sort. The fan service instead relies on women with abnormally large and giggly chests more than openly graphic nudity.

HOTD provides less flat out humor than you might expect from most ""funny"" anime. However, it provides jokes in a much more subtle way that still let's you enjoy yourself. For example, in one scene, a character decides to use a girl's breasts to stabilize his machine gun as he fired it.

I really liked some of the characterization in this anime. People aren't quite as idiotically stupid as they appear in other zombie films, and will often say what you might expect them to. I particularly like the smart girl with glasses, as she quickly manages to reason out what is going on instead of rambling around for 3 episodes saying... ""Oh is that what is going on?"" like is produced in many Hollywood movies.

This is not a horror anime, and I can't say I was scared for a single moment. The main characters seem relatively invincible so far as they work together to blast through one zombie infestation after another. Three of the characters, specifically, seem to be able to beat and hit their way through any amount of zombies without a second thought, giving you very little sense of danger. If you try to see this as some kind of horror flick with building dread and suspense, you will be be disappointed. If you see this as some fun zombie killing good time guilty pleasure like Zombieland or Left 4 Dead, then sit back and enjoy yourself, as this anime can be very enjoyable.

One last thing, this is not the full series. This is merely the first season of a potentially multi season show. It does not end in a cliffhanger, but it doesn't really end complete either, as there are tons of unanswered questions left by the end, most of all being how are they going to survive? The next series is said to start soon and I eagerly await for it's release as well.

To sum it up, this is a good fun watch but there is very little substance here. It's a zombie smashing, boob swinging, good time and not much else. I give it a 4 star because within one season there is very little progression storywise, but is otherwise a fun watch.",1315180800,2,2719,4.505070993914807
4462672,5,B004SGWYW4,"I came across this anime on a preview of the on-demand service offered by it's US distributing channel on my cable provider and after watching the 1st two episodes fell in love with this show.

The positives:
1. The colors and shadings used in the animation are consistent with the theme of this anime.  There is darkness to indicate the evil the kids are facing while bright colors are shown to indicate the hopefulness of youth, etc.

2. The story is well-written.  The characters are developed adequately and enough back-story is given to understand their traits.

3. The action is intense.  You get taken in by the fight of the children just to stay alive.

The negatives:
1. The animators become a bit too enthralled by the Japanese ideas of sexuality.  There are innumerable shots of the girls panties(even one of a young girl not even of age, really kinda creepy to be honest).  The breasts on the girls are all very large and a good deal of effort has been put forth to make them a focal point.  The normal Japanese bouncing boob sound effect becomes numerous and kinda tedious.  The nudity isn't bad, although the shower scene will discourage some from watching.  But nothing too unwatchable.

2. The ending left a good deal to be desired.  I'm having to search for the manga to see if the story ends as I think it does with Saeko becoming the love interest instead of Rei, etc.  Again, annoying but not out of line with the endings of some Japanese shows which can be infamous for their head-scratching endings.

Overall, this DVD has become on of my favorite series and is well worth the watch.  I really think it's one of the better shows I've seen, and although I'm only about 2 years into my anime addiction, this series does stand out for an enthralling story-line.

in the story. Be aware though lot's and lot's and lot's of fan service I meant this anime should be rated R if it isn't. Some of the characters are surprising and some are a total cliche.

The action and animation is superb and the story is very convincing. I thought the girls in the bathroom scene was hilarious and i have found alot of the crude humor to be very lightening. Now i will admit some of this is so ridiculous, like a bullet doing the matrix between a pair of boobs but i think this anime is a great change. Only problem with this collection is that the OVA is not included in it. I reccomend this whole heartedly however i think this is an anime you save up for and not make an impulse buy. I mena it is $40 for 12 episodes. Kinda close to, too expensive but it's worth it in the end.",1313280000,4,735,4.183098591549296

The plot follows through for the most part, and given that they haven't make the further episodes to make use of the various plot details set up in the first season it has some hope for improvement.  I gave it only 4 out of 5 because it was advertised as a comedy, but even viewed as a very low brow comedy it doesn't fill the bill.  So if your into the teen jiggle shoot-em-up anime/manga you will probably like it, just don't expect to get any laughs out of it.",1313193600,,543,4.41

4462682,3,B004SGWYW4,"I watched HOTD in Japanese- so I can't speak for the dub, since I actually didn't by the DVD yet. This is a short series, and they oddly enough stamped it forty dollars? No way. The show is entertaining to watch on a rainy day, if you don't have anything better to watch. But, to spend that much on 12 episodes of a show with virtually NO story whatsoever and nothing but fanservice is like paying for a prostitute to stare at.

Cliches out the ass. Every character has huge breasts and a butt that could be considered a rear bust. We get every sort of overused carbon copy stereotype that we can. Moe, super moe, super tsundere, loli, fat nerd otaku, the overly regular guy who turns out to be a badass, military chick and so on. It's nothing to write home about. The animation is decent, but it seems they put the most budget and effort into shading the female assets when they're constantly jamming them down your throat. Call me gay for saying there's too much fanservice... but there really is.

I can't bash it for not having a story, since it's a zombie plot. Government shadiness, people dying, moral crisis, loss of innocence, it's all rather typical. So they don't gain points but they don't lose many either. Though you can call them unoriginal and dock points if you're critical like me.

There's a carefree negligence the show makes blatantly obvious almost every scene. They all know that they could easily die and be doomed at any moment, but... nobody seems to care. I understand losing the will to live during the apocalypse, but they just blindly run into hordes of zombies like ""LOLOL I HOPE I DUN GET BIT! DERP! CLOSE RANGE IS SMART WITH FLESH EATING INFECTED!"" and it sort of pisses me off. Sure- it makes things 'fun' but at the same time makes it just lack just a bit more logic (though I know mentioning logic in a series about zombies is retarded).

So- overall... if you want a new reason to look up images of certain characters and desire a blond haired nurse character who has breasts that might hit the floor if she were topless, look up High School of the Dead. It's not an amazing series, but there's a bit of fun bloodbrawling that makes you smirk and some nice bums and bewbs forced into every other scene. It's amazingly overpriced and I can only imagine that all the females have the most disgusting dubs ever- but give it a shot if you need something to keep you awake for a few hours.",1312848000,7,2421,4.445945945945946
4462683,5,B004SGWYW4,"It's another ordinary day in Japan...until, for reasons unknown, the corpses of the recently-decease suddenly rise up and start attacking people!

Despite the title, only the first two episodes take place in the school. After that, the six main characters escape and try to find safe haven anywhere they can. (They also escape the school with a teacher and several other students in a bus, but the teacher turns out to be a power-mad wanna-be dictator of sorts who turns the surviving students into his own little cult, so the main characters-five students and the school nurse-separate from that group and try to make it on their own.)

If you've seen American zombie movies it's pretty obvious this show was STRONGLY influenced by them. The same rules that went for most flesh-eating zombie films apply here as well: If a zombie bites you, you become one of them, and the only way to kill a zombie is to shoot or stab it in the head, killing it's brain. I also noticed at the very beginning what seemed to be a direct nod to the recent DAWN OF THE DEAD remake, when army helicopters pass over the heads of two of the lead characters when they're on the roof of the school building, but don't stop to help them.

As the Amazon reviewer noted, we don't get any explanation as to why exactly the dead have risen and are attacking people. However the same thing is true for alot of ""killer zombie"" films. (The above-mentioned DAWN OF THE DEAD remake, the 1990 NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD remake, DIARY OF THE DEAD, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, ect.) Also this is based on a manga series and it only covers roughly one half of the manga, so it's possible they just might later in the manga give an explanation.

And of course, because it's Japanese anime, there's tons of fanservice. Enjoy!",1312502400,2,1774,4.551724137931035

4462687,3,B004SGWYW4,"I'm going to try to keep this to about a paragraph, because its about as far as the depth of this series went for me. This anime, which I started watching without any prior knowledge from the comics, has a few things going for it and a few that they do not. The good-The animation is nice and fluid, with an occasional 3-d scene. The voice acting is also done well. Side characters tend to react realistically to the situations at hand. The bad-While it is fun to see someone jump onto a bridge with a motorcycle,along with other fun action sequences, nobody else in this universe does anything as cool as the main characters in fight scenes. Not even the military. The gigantic-The breasts. Everywhere. This goes into the bad portion also, because while it was funny for the stupid blonde to be stacked and actually have a wobble sound effect when she moved, there are entire sections, one taking up almost a full episode, just to have them in there. Its not a porno, but its more then enough.
For what its worth, its a fun litle show to watch, but if it has a sequel or a movie, I'd probably not check it out.",1312070400,4,1111,4.371980676328502

The dubbing company is fairly new and unheard of, But they did a really good job with this one. Only real complaint I had with there dubbing job was that they added a lot of not really needed swearing. If you are into Mature animes, you will love this one. If you aren't, I would recommend something more like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I hope this helps.",1311984000,,625,4.35042735042735
4462689,5,B004SGWYW4,"Yes, it has a lot of fanservice and some part are exaggerated. However, this anime has a lot of action moments and comedy. I watched the original broadcast in Japanese. Then just recently, I found out that it was available in the US with English dubs. I didn't think twice to get it. The English dub is pretty good, and this is the kind of anime that you want American jokes in. I've watched this at least 8 times already and I'm not tired of it yet. It's one of those rare gens that you don't want to end. Apparently there is a sequel stated for September in Japan, so get this so you don't miss on anything.

Ok, a little bit of the plot. Takashi is your regular lazy high school student. One day, he is skipping classes until he witnesses a murder right in front of the school gate; then the teachers that were there started killing each other. And that's where hell broke loose. You have Rei who was member of the spear club, Saeko was a member of the kendou club (sword techniques and stuff), Takagi is the school's genius girl who provides everyone with most of the info, and the school nurse who helps the team in different ways. Those are the girls in the team. Now the guys; Hirano is a student who used to get bullied a lot, but he didn't complain. He actually received military training and is the weapon's specialist of the group. Takashi is the guy who doesn't have a real skill other than to adapt to what's going on. He's got good thinking and he is most mental-stable person of the group (which is shown later on in the anime and manga). Takashi s the type of guy who has natural leader qualities. He tries to move forward with everyone and tries to help them in any way he can. Later on, they find a little girl named Alice.

Basically, the whole world has been overrun with zombies or ""them,"" as they call them in the anime. The team works together to get to their goal, which is to make sure everyone's families is secure. They come across a variety of times such as weapons, motorcycles, cars, and even a bus. They move forward thinking of the best possible option for them to stay alive. There some conflicts, but that's what makes it exciting. Some fans have even stated that they like this better than the Resident Evil zombies, and it's not hard to understand why.

Now, the blu-ray version is in full 1080p and it looks stunning. It has both Japanese and English audio in true HD. If you have a home theater, then this is the perfect anime to show it off. The animation is top notch and the action moments are great, though they ,ay go a little overboard in some parts. Also, it has nudity such as breasts and stuff. That's just a warning so that you don't watch this in front of someone who may feel offended by it. It also has some foul language.

There are those who cannot stand boobs, those who love boobs, and those who actually watched the series and discovered a great anime.  I am with the last group.  For me great series come down to two things: an interesting story and character development; and HotD has that.  I agree that fan service can be over the top sometimes, but if you are intelligent enough to look beyond the boobs, you will find a great series with potential for greatness.  I will spare you from the details of the story because I do not want to spoil it.

If you are hesitant about buying this series because it is only part of a larger story (this is a manga adaption), I will not be worried because this first 12 episodes are self contained and can stand as complete series with a beginning and conclusion.  I am hopeful that more seasons will come out in the near future.  High School of the Dead is a very appealing story and urge everyone to give this anime a chance.",1311552000,2,1018,4.377659574468085

Sentai Filmworks did a good job on the American release. The dubbing was dead on and the picture was perfect. And of course all the TV edited scenes were un-edited (is that a word?).

It was hinted of a Season 2 verified at Comic Con 2011 panel. Hopefully Sentai Filmworks gets the project for American release.

Obviously, it's a zombie outbreak type of show. But there's also an underlying Harem concept. Other than the 2 main guys, the rest of the cast is made up of overly developed high school girls....and one teacher. It has something for everyone: The Otaku gun nut, the martial arts expert, the genius, the helpless & hopeless nurse, & let's not forget the hapless couple. Oh, I forgot to mention the little kid (loli) added for cuteness. All this on top of the massive amount of zombies, blood, gore, guns & F'ed up nonsense.

4462695,2,B004SGWYW4,"Okay, so my friend was raving about how great this anime is. So I decided to check it out.
Well, let me say something first, it's misnamed. It should be called ""High School of the Boobs"" because they take up more of the anime than the zombies. I literally had to watch each episode twice just because the boobs were UNREASONABLY bouncy, and incredibly distracting.
Pros:
-Great animation
-(2 or 3) likable characters
-They actually did  pretty good job predicting how people would act in a zombie apocalypse.

Cons:
-Boobs that have the consistency of yogurt mixed with water
-WAY to much fan-service. Too much to ignore at least.

It's true that there are more pros than cons, but the cons are bad enough to ruin the anime. The only real reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the very few pros.
If you like anime's with watery-yogurt-in-plastic-bag like boobs that take up a good 50% of the screen time then this the anime for you. But if you like paying attention to the plot then definitely don't watch this anime.",1310688000,4,1018,4.551912568306011

4462697,5,B004SGWYW4,"I am a huge fan of George A. Romero style zombie action. This show takes that style and makes it it's own. There is plenty of eye candy in the form of guns, blood, and lots of T&A. The story is not overly complex. A group of high school students are looking for their families in the middle of a zombie (and eventually nuclear) apocalypse. The team consists of the protagonist, his love interest, the gun otaku, the very tsundere class rep, the sexy kendo girl, the ditzy school nurse, a little girl they rescue, and the dog mascot named Zero. Most of the time it is a fast paced zombie murder extravaganza. When the action slows down it becomes a blood rushing t&a grope fest. That is not saying there is no real story or character development, it is just very shallow compared to a lot of anime I usually enjoy. That is not a complaint mind you. It would have been nice to have the ova on the blu ray, but again I am not complaining as I did not enjoy the ova near as much as the rest of the series. There are no extras whatsoever, but the blu ray is nice. It is crisp and clean. The English dub is not too bad as far as dubs go. I prefer watching it in Japanese with English subs, but that is just a personal preference. People who prefer dubs will not be disappointed. I love this series and recommend it to everyone.

4462698,5,B004SGWYW4,"I finally finished the Blu-Ray so I figured I would give my 2 cents on the anime. I was very impressed with the dubbing in this particular version of HotD. I've over time become somewhat used to bad dubbing in Japanese anime so I was glad to hear the voice actors putting in a lot of effort. They really did a good job of making the characters sound and act realistically.

The Blu-Ray itself has great quality and because of that and the fact that it's uncut I noticed things that I never noticed in the original airing. The audio quality is also top notch.

It has simple packaging with 2 Blu-Ray's. Eight episodes on the first disc and four episodes on the second disk.

Like others have mentioned it is an action packed zombie apocalypse style anime with lots of blood, fan service, and a bit of vulgar language. Nothing worse than the kind you hear on the streets. You can learn much more about its contents from the current highest rated review so I won't go into a lot of detail. I mainly just wanted to touch on how impressed I was with the quality of this version.

Overall Rating 5/5 stars. Enjoy the anime.",1310083200,46,1117,4.381642512077295

First the show has no set tone. It tries to balance serious characterization with over the top violence with titillation with comedy and ends up botching the whole thing. For example it has a bath scene where all of the (underage) female characters who have breasts too big to exist in nature are topless and it cuts back and forth between that and brutal violence all within less then a minute. This lack of consistency makes the audience not know what mindset to be in thus causing a huge headache.

The characters are also a big problem. They try to shoehorn in depth to them but it seems like an afterthought. It's as if a sixth grader wrote them and that's not due to a bad translation the original Japanese version is even worse. They have two characters a pink haired girl and a future unibomber who are polar opposites yet for some reason they have what is laughably called a romance.

This is one of the worst animes I've ever seen, if you're 14 and love violence and boobs you'll enjoy it but people looking for a legitimate take on a zombie outbreak should avoid it like the plague.",1309910400,23,1227,4.39647577092511
4462700,4,B004SGWYW4,"I should point it out so it is clearly visible.  The OVA is NOT in the US release (hopefully if there is another season, it will go in that set).  And aren't they using the title ""Complete Collection"" a little early?  It's not complete now, and we don't know for sure that more won't be animated.

The annoying part, is that the OVA was known about long ago, so either nobody did their research, the contracts were done way too early, or like many anime brought over to the US, the local producers refused to spring for the extra material licensing.
I've been thinking the latter on a lot of recent releases since I keep seeing info stating 2.0 dolby on shows that were broadcast in 5.1 AC-3.  Not sure if that is the case here, though.

We're watching this at our anime club, and other than the rather amazed impression the super-breast-overdose with slo-mo and bullet-dodging was, in terms of animation... most of the members (including me) thought the extreme over-the-top fanservice was annoying, unnecessary (the story and characters were plenty sufficient without it), and distracting. It degraded the story and experience. The slapped-in-the-face with mammaries experience could only have been worse if done in 3D.

It's worth seeing, even with all that. Those impressed enough by it... go track down the manga...  Just, please, don't, let, Hollywood, get, ahold, of, this!",1309824000,,1380,4.8927038626609445

4462703,5,B004SGWYW4,"I just received mine in the mail today!
It's solid, it's exactly like the Japanese version.
The Blu-ray is uncensored, and everything is crystal clear. All the nudes scenes are in it, as well as the gore factor. I'm so stoked that I got it.
I definitely recommend this, HOTD is a must for your anime collection!

However, there is a downside to it if you prefer Japanese audio. The audio quality for the Japanese is only 2.0 where as the English dubbed is 5.1. So if you enjoy watching it in Japanese with Subs, like I do, you might have to crank it up a little more than usual. Also, the English dub isn't so bad, the dialogue isn't as awkward as others. So if you're cool with English Dubs then this is a plus for you!

Also, the Blu-ray does not come with the OVA for your info., neither does the DVD version.

Hope this helps!

P.S. it's definitely worth the price!",1309392000,4,869,4.280487804878049
4462704,5,B004SGWYW4,"Imagine if you will...... if the cast from Left 4 Dead was relocated to a Japanese high school and the cast was replaced by a two out-cast males and four buxom hotties. Each character has an interesting back story and dynamic personality. Each character grows throughout the course of the series.  Highschool of the Dead is one of the best series that I've seen so far this year. the series manages a really good balance between Action, Drama and Humor. Those of you who are turned off by excess amounts of fan service may be turned off by the amount of ""close-ups"" on the female anatomy. I personally found them hilarious (for example, in one scene when a main character has her mammories used a gun rest for an AK-47).

You really feel for the main characters by episode 12. Everyone who enjoys this will probably have a favorite character and at least one character you wish will become zombie chow. Coda-the nerdy basement shut-in Otaku (with Dr. Jekyll/ Mr. Rambo personality) is probably my favorite.

The animation is amazing and the action-scenes are very cool. It sucks that it's only 12 episodes. There are rumors about a season 2..... One can only hope.

I would recommend this series not just to anime fans. Fans of horror movies and zombie flicks will find it enjoyable as well.",1309392000,2,1291,4.674008810572687
4462705,5,B004SGWYW4,"The T&A and fan service stuff is fairly excessive early on in this.  Honestly thought of giving a lower rating because of it but as things progress it settles into one of the best zombie flicks I have ever seen.  One thing to keep in mind is that this covers only the first three days after the zombie outbreak.  You could almost look at this as a prequel to Walking Dead.  Main difference is that it spreads very, very, fast.",1309305600,,426,4.2875
4462706,5,B004SGWYW4,"I was a skeptic. But people who had seen the show had decent things to say about it. I recieved it yesterday and watched the entire season in one sitting (with a break to walk the dog). Afterwards I have to say, WHERE IS SEASON 2!! This was a great series. It truly developed the characters and you started liking/disliking them because of their traits. Yes it is anime, but it tackled the idea of zombie apocalypse quite ""realistically"" (so to speak) in the terms of how it would spread and how society would change in a heartbeat. Do you only look out for yourself or do you put your neck on the line to save a stranger from death? Would you kill the weaker, to ensure your own survival? Are you capable of killing or has it been something deeply woven into you that you feared what would happen if it came out?

None of the characters are exactly alike. Some of them are just there for laughs(Nurse Megamammory) who even responds to the question of why she's so ditzy by stating it's how she was written. It doesn't take itself so seriously, there are laugh out loud moments, and OMG REALLY!?!?!?! moments. The combat is great, voice acting was remarkable given some of the horrible voice overs lately.

The one thing that I wanted to do though was beat them for always yelling, its like HELLO ZOMBIES CAN HEAR YOU, SHUT UP lol. Super glad I bought this series as it is one to watch several times over. Zombie destruction day marathons FTW!

I truly hope they come out with a season 2 because this is one series to follow. I fear like most of the anime I end up loving it will be a one season wonder to only be lived out in the imagination of it's true fans.",1309219200,2,1661,4.3173076923076925
4462707,5,B004SGWYW4,"Basically Highschool of the dead is series that is very well animated, looks amazing in HD, has a rather excellent dub and a gripping story.

If you're a fan of zombies and emotional drama and fanservice this show mixes them together perfectly, the story basically starts off at a school where a teacher gets bitten and turned into a zombie, and then goes on to bite others until the school is swarmed with Zombies, several characters survive and form a group that through seemingly impossible situations, just wants to survive and find their loved ones.

There is a lot of fanservice in this show, but its good, and well animated, and refreshing even, the English audio is good, has a fair amount of swear words, and cultural references, by this I mean they added random lines like a reference to Palin in a certain scene.

Buy this awesome series now if you're a zombie fan, a fanservice fan, and a fan of action, and someone who is wondering what all 3 mixed together would look like.

I hope you enjoyed my non spoilerific review, that if you're lazy like me, and wondering if the show is worth buying, should answer your questions.

And if you live outside of America, Section 23/Sentai Filmworks locks their Blu Rays to A, Europe is Region B, so don't buy the Blu Ray if you're not American/Canadian or anyone who lives in the Region A area.",1308355200,3,1347,4.572614107883817
4462708,5,B004SGWYW4,"I came by this title a few months ago, of course there was no english dub yet, so I won't be able to comment on the english voice actors.  But, what I can tell you about, is this awesome show.  The replay value of this flick is unbelievably high and I haven't even scene it in english yet.  The story was so well told, the flow was so smooth, the action was so vivid and intense, and the characters were so very life like and human (well the martial arts was maybe a little too awesome for human standards but who cares IT'S Martial arts, I mean, I bet you Jet Li or Jackie Chan could do it).  I was always on the edge of my seat waiting for the next development, I have to honestly say that this anime did such an outstanding job on the whole zombie thing it made me want more zombies even though zombies have been soo over played over the decades that I couldn't care less for the next zombie flick.  When the series ended I wanted so much more that I just had to go back to the beginning and watch it again.  The flick is almost completely flawless but like everything else in the world nothing is perfect and the only problem I had with the show was the fan fare.  Way too much, but I must say they did some pretty cool things with the cg and some of the girls bossism ;).  Plainly the show just didn't need it, any true fan or even your plain John and Jane Doe would love this flick with out the fan fare.

I highly recommend this show to anybody well... as long as your old enough to watch and enjoy.",1305936000,,1506,4.043771043771044
4462709,4,B004SGWYW4,"While other movies have come and gone, this one has certainly suprised me. I walked into this expecting something rediculously stupid, but was suprised by how amazing this really is. I like how they did stick to zombies being ""walkers"" because a dead body cannot run, it defies biology. The characters are interesting, there is suspense, drama, and all around awesome zombie killing. Just something that should defenitely be purchased asap by any anime lover. 10,000,000,000,000,000 times better than Garcey's Wings",1305331200,7,515,5.37037037037037
4462710,4,B004SGWYW4,"At first I was a bit hesitant to watch the series, thinking it was another melodramatic series featuring a post-apocalyptic nightmare world populated by emo kids struggling against inner demons and their own insecurity.  The first episode annihilates any such stereotype.  These students mean business and they aren't afraid to dish it out, even to zombies who used to be their friends and loved ones.
Based soley on the story its a strong series, it capitalizes a bit on the ""Resident Evil"" syndrome, but puts enough of a twist on it that you really don't see a comparison.  The characters are all very well defined, though they ocassionally cross traditional anime stereotypes (the geeky Otaku, the buxom school nurse, the proud and intelligent school president, the flashy bad boy, and even the katana wielding shrine priestess in training) they do so in a way that makes them endearing and not annoying.
There is enough action to make the series intense, but most of the action is about the survival aspect and how to cope with the loss of thier world.  While structured somewhat like a ""harem series"" there isn't alot of overt romance involved.  The ocassional ""fan service"" is great, but conveniently placed towels and steam prevent the series from getting too racy (but the jiggling continues!).  Personally I didn't mind the censoring, in most cases I think its just silly to censor it and I wouldn't mind seeing an uncensored version down the line (fingers crossed) but it's no big deal.
The series just seems to be starting to come together when the 12th Episode rolls in and leaves you wondering.  This is definitely one I will be following closely, hopefully the recent events in Japan will not prevent them from publishing more of this great series!",1305244800,3,1762,4.89261744966443
4462711,5,B004SGWYW4,"Highschool of the dead is a zombie anime with plenty of action, ecchi, and funny situations. The story starts out in the private high school of the character Takashi when he first starts to see the zombie plague spreading in his school his first reaction is to try to save the girl that hes loved (Rei) since he was a small child by picking her up from her classroom and getting her to
a safe place. The situation quickly escalates as the infection spreads to the whole school and they quickly have to evacuate the school to get to a safer place. Along the way they meet other students and a nurse who have survived the zombie plague and they make their escape from the zombie infested school to the city.

Much of the film is spent running from zombies and taking shelter from place to place while showing how the world has turned into total chaos and anarchy all around them as the zombie plague spreads. There are so many scenes with bouncing boobies, naughty poses, revealing outfits and girls moaning over anything that it feels like im watching a porno film with action in it. Not to say thats a bad thing but sometimes it feels like its a little over the top for a normal anime.

The first season was pretty short (12 episodes) but it had some good foundations laid out for character relationships in season 2 (mostly Rei & Saeko with Takashi) or possibly even Saya with Kohta after seeing episode 12 (although she likes Takashi alot more). It will be interesting to see a season 2 if they ever make one to see if any of the other main characters familys survived the zombie plague and to find out what the cause of the plague was to begin with.

Pros
--------------
- Lots of Action (makes it fun to watch)
- Lots of huge bouncing Boobies (what guy doesnt like boobies?)
- Nude scenes (The shower episode was epic)
- Never a dull moment
- Funny Jokes and scenes (Example: ""All these zombies and im going to get killed by an Asian woman driver"" -Kohta)
- No Fillers
- No Censors (who would want all the good stuff cut out?)
- Great Music soundtrack

Cons
--------------
- The credits play before the end of each episode, never seen any other animes do this only this one. Why would they play the credits before the whole episode is finished? they probably really want people to read the credits.
- No Second season out yet.
- Price is a little high at $39 for 5 hours worth of content on 2 blu-ray disc (12 episodes).

Conclusion
--------------
It might be a really long time until they release a second season of this show but I definitely enjoyed the show enough to buy the first season for $39. I just hope that they make a second season soon as the first one was very entertaining to watch and im curious to see how the characters continue to develop.",1305158400,205,2762,4.397260273972603

The story is nothing short of amazing, probably the best story I've seen in an ecchi / harem, seriously 10/10 for the story. The character development is also phenomenal. The combat is entertaining which is rare in the genre. The show also has comedic moments even though it's set in an apocalyptic world (zombies) The show has only one downside and that is that it only has one season and will likely never get another.
