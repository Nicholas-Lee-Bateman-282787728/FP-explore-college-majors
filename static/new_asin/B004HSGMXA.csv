8429689,4,B004HSGMXA,Ride had nice variety. Couple of long hill climbs along with a couple of recovery type segments.  Enough hours of riding with variety to make most of us satisfied.,1381622400,,163,4.620689655172414
8429690,4,B004HSGMXA,"I bought this DVD to help me get through winter training indoors for my first century ride which is in a couple of months.  I just got it and used it for the first time this week.  The first disc was definately a challenge.  Paul and his guest talk about cycling and their experiences, which is always a bonus for me.  Towards the end of the first disc something happens to Pauls microphone and he is somewhat hard to hear, although it isn't bad.  I appreciate his guidance on how to use his dashboard during the ride.  And the tips that he and his guest give during the ride are invaluable.  I'm going to try to remember them when I can start getting outside to train!",1366156800,,669,4.261904761904762
8429691,5,B004HSGMXA,"There are 5 very different workouts in this package of DVD's.  I haven't been able to complete them all in one day as they are HARD!  The climbs in 2 of them are long and exhausting.  Even when you get to the top and think you have earned the reward of riding down Paul just picks up the pace and your dying once again.  Maybe I'm a sucker for punishment but I just love them.  The scenery is just spectacular and I love it that Paul takes the camera off his bike at times and pans around so we can see the amazing views.  Rather than listen to the commentary AGAIN, I listened to the music and road noise and especially on the 5th disc the music was great.  Paul must have tuned into a radio station which I thought made everything just a little more life-like.  I have to say that you can be a little mislead by the first 20 mins of disc 1!!  It is such a wonderful cruise I wanted the whole ride to continue like that but then BAM, the first climb hits you and there is no rest for a whole hour, straight up.  Paul stays at a manageable pace the whole time but there is no let up, just up, up, up.  It happens again in disc 3 but even that climb doesn't seem as bad as the first climb.  Definitely a worthwhile investment.  I am a better climber for it.",1300406400,3,1256,4.016129032258065

The panoramic views make you feel like you are in the middle of the pack. From your stationary bike to the road. Its that simple. This is one of the best rides you will ever experience!",1300320000,6,586,9.482142857142858
