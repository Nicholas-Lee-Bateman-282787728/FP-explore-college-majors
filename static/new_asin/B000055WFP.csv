7931162,5,B000055WFP,"Personally, Mainframe was easily one of my top 5 animation studios.  They were responsible for some of the best Saturday mornings Ive ever had.  ReBoot, Beast Wars/Machines & of course this excellent little show, War Planets (I know Shadow Raiders is the DVD title but I always knew it as War Planets & thats what it will remain for me).  Ill never forget the first time I tuned into this show.  I had recently gotten some of the toys, & then one day when my mother was checking the cable guide she told me that there was a show called War Planets.  I was immediately interested, though I wondered how they would be able to make a show out of it.  But after the first episode I was hooked for life.  Next to Transformers, this is my favorite toy-based series.  This show was just awesome.  The writing was very good, and the animation remains the best looking of Mainframes shows & some of the best CGI Ive ever seen.  It was so good my mother liked watching it with me as well as the other Mainframe shows.  Its a shame that it only got 2 seasons when it deserved more.

Heres a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

1.  Behold the Beast:  With the destruction of planet Tek, the sole survivor, princess Tekla accompanied by Voxx travels to another system to warn all planets about the Beast Invaders. She crash lands on planet Ice where a quarrel between the Royal legion of King Cryos confronts a Rock expeditionary mining squad, at least until a Beast cohort launches a full-scale attack.  An excellent episode that remains one of the best first episodes Ive seen of any show.  A+

2.  On The Rocks:  The Aurora, Cryos' flagship, travels to planet Rock to convince Lord Mantle to join the Alliance.  Sadly the army arrests Graveheart, and the Rock King expels the Ice King determining he is still his greatest enemy.  A great follow-up episode.  A

3.  Born In Fire:  The Aurora travels to planet Fire in hope of convincing prince Pyrus to join them.  The obstacle here is the Grand Vizier who doesnt trust strangers.  He orders Graveheart and King Cryos to survive a labyrinth of lava where lava dogs are lethal beasts. Meanwhile, Zera, Cryos' daughter, is furious at prince Pyrus for not intervening but a Beast battalion interrupts their argument.  My least favorite episode on here.  Its good, but not fantastic. B

4.  Bad To The Bone:  The Alliance travels to planet Bone but finds a surprise - the Beast planet is already there.  Emperor Femur, an arrogant and egotistical leader, agreed to welcome both the Beast and the Alliance on his world.  This is an excellent episode, with some very funny moments.  Femurs always a riot.  A+

A good batch of episodes.  Unfortunately, these DVDs seem to be very hard to find nowadays.  Ive been looking for almost 10 years, & only have 4 of the 6 volumes to show for it (plus a VHS tape of Volume 3, but this time the DVD really blows the VHS away because the animation doesnt look nearly as good).  Heres hoping that Shout Factory will rerelease this series in one box set like they did with ReBoot, especially since its only 26 episodes long which means it won't be too expensive.  But until then, Ill take whatever I can get of this gem.",1387152000,,3211,4.532286212914485
7931163,5,B000055WFP,"Wonderful characters, outstanding special effects, great plots and superb voice actors are just a few reasons to own this set of six great DVD's.

The story follows the adventures of the inhabitants of warring worlds that must come together to battle a common foe set on destroying them all. Honor, sacrifice and co-operation are regular themes of the series intermingled with deceit and deception.

Myself and my 7 year-old daughter really enjoy the action-packed episodes and the great character development. I have a state-of-the-art HD home theater set-up and these disks translate wonderfully to the big screen. The excellent sound quality is the icing on the cake.

Obviously, I give this series my highest recommendation.",1360368000,,728,5.3130434782608695
7931164,5,B000055WFP,"I'm just re-watching this now for the third time and, although the cgi animation now looks a bit dated (of course, it was made in the 90s), there is nothing about this show I don't like. Even though it was made to promote a toy series, you would never think it while watching it. The developers did such a fantastic job fleshing out the characters so that we can see their strengths and weaknesses. There are characters you love in this series, and characters you loathe. Most importantly, the villains DON'T SUCK. They are actually formidable foes that give our heroes a run for their money and the concept of the Beast Planet is pulled off in such a way as to make any encounter with it terrifying.

There are a couple of cheesy lines, but c'mon. That's what tv animation is all about. It's cheesy in a funny way. I have re-watched cartoons I loved as a kid and they are corny in a bad way and that goes to show that the series cannot appeal to older audiences. This show can appeal to people of all ages I believe. Even my dad stayed to watch the series in the old days when I had taped it off the television on the VHS.

I know it's very difficult to find this series now, but if you like sci-fi action it is definitely worthwhile picking this series up.",1337040000,,1258,4.281512605042017
7931165,5,B000055WFP,"Shadow Raiders is a quite pedestrian title for such a ground breaking series. This show began as a simple tie-in for the War Planets toys, but Mainframe Entertainment kicked it up a notch, creating an involved backstory and peopling? the planets with an extensive roster of entities. Mainframe is known for cutting-edge CGI and in-depth story lines as previously shown in ReBoot and Transformers Beast Wars, but this show took both to new levels.

Viewers may have passed on the show when it originally aired, dismissing it as another glorified advertisement for a toy line, and viewers now would hardly be attracted by the lackluster title ""Shadow Raiders."" But as viewers then and now have discovered, this show is one of the best kept secrets in animation. Now on DVD, at last the secret's out.",1143417600,,797,4.9037037037037035
7931166,5,B000055WFP,"I saw this when it was a television series called War Planets, which alternately is based on a collection of rather interesting toys. I have no idea why they would change the title to Shadow Raiders, which says absolutely nothing about the series. Usually when you see a show based on toys all you really get is a shameful commercial for the toys. This time you get something that not only goes beyond most other toy-shows but actually is a lot better than most regular animated shows that came out at the time.

This show has it all. Character and plot development, great soundtrack, impressive special effects, all the things you come NOT to expect from a kids show. This first DVD volume gives you the creation of the underlying plot of the whole series... survival against the planet-eating Beast. In these four episodes you get a whole lot of story development and get introduced to a fascinating back-story of how these several planets who have an abundance of one resource constantly steal from each other to get the resources they sorely lack.

The actual computer generated animation was excellent for its time, rivaling that of similar shows like Reboot (even surpassing in my opinion). I'm guessing those of you used to seeing more modern CG like Shrek and Incredibles might balk at this earlier work, but if you do that's your loss. The voice talents they got for this series are perfect. Not an oddball in the bunch from the serious characters to the comedy reliefs. The extras on the DVD aren't plentiful, but it's better than nothing. You get some interesting background data (albeit a small amount) as well as 350 degree views of various stuff from the show.

This is a series worth getting if you're a fan of science fiction. The story premise alone is worth looking at, but it's even better with the fact the execution of said premise was done so well. You really gotta check this out.",1104710400,8,1903,4.691616766467066
7931167,5,B000055WFP,"This is a great show not to be passed by. The story line is superb the charcters are all great.
If you are a ReBoot fan who has never seen War Planets/Shadow Raiders do not hesitate to check it out you will not be dissapointed. I have only just recenty seen this show after buying it on DVD and fell in love with it and was disapointed when I found out there were only 2 seasons made, but those 2 seasons are both on DVD and play out extreamly well.
This is definatly not just a kids show.
If you are a scifi fan I highly reccommend Shadow Raiders!",1010102400,8,548,4.036697247706422
7931168,5,B000055WFP,"This disc is great the quality of the picture an sound is supurb, and the extras are interesting and well organised throughout the set. The series is great and everyone who likes cgi stuff and Transformers should see it. It works quite well as a prelude to Transformers the Movie, kind of like a story of what unicron did before he got into what he did in that movie. Although of course the beast in this is not unicron but he could be, I think the series ran it's course and did all it could do, if it hd carried on longer it would just have gotten thinner and dragged out. Also it's great that every episode is here just as they were originally, only two tiny things to fault with this set. One, there is one episode that didn't really need to be there, but that's a problem with the original writing. Also all the episodes have 1 advert chapter break instead of two, but this is such a minor point it's not even worth mentioning.",1004572800,6,932,4.271186440677966
7931169,5,B000055WFP,"Shadow Raiders is a show that is full of good twists. You can HATE Lord Mantel for exiling Graveheart from his home world, Planet Rock. I like he part when Graveheart's best friend Jade joins him on his mission(she would have to be my favourite). At some times I hate Emperor Femur because of all the truouble he courses for everyone(like the time he used Tekla to steel Planet Rock's Battle Moons).At times we see different views of each of the creatures in the show. But its a great show, worth watching.",991958400,8,506,4.510869565217392
7931170,5,B000055WFP,"I saw this as War Planets a couple of years ago. If I'm correct either writers Len Wein and/or Marv Wolfman and Christy Marx may have written some episodes, meaning that it's an incredibly high-quality show. I think you love the explosive effects most of all, very cool. The main characters are not without personality and you will definitely be able to distinguish them apart. For anyone who likes military sci-fi or space wars, you're in for a great treat. So, go get it already !",988329600,4,482,4.616279069767442
