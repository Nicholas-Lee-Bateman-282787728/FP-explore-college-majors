There was not any explanation as to which play the soliloquies were being performed, who the were actors on stage and play , scene, act and line that were being performed.  Also it would have helped if there was an explanation as to what made the dialogue great. Also there was not any relevance to the play, the meter nor anything but an actor in a period attire reciting the lines. It would have been better if an actor read the lines terribly without emoting and then reciting the lines with vigor and explaining what was being told since the vocabulary of Early Modern England was so ambiguous. Skip this and buy each play separately and by different production companies.",1475798400,,799,4.707142857142857
8025148,5,B0002ABTFI,I think that these actors give a very credible rendition of the Bard's soliloques.  not over-acted or over-emotive. Truly artisticly done.,1461542400,,138,5.571428571428571
8025149,2,B0002ABTFI,"I was disappointed by this DVD.  It is a series of about 20 Shakespearean soliloquies by semi-pro actors.  The production quality of the performances are average but the quality of the DVD itself is atrocious.  The menus are backwards, non-existant or confusing. I thought the purpose of this DVD was to show the best soliloquies from Shakespeare but the choices don't include Othello and many others where there are great speeches to be found.  Might be good for kids or others who have little exposure to Shakespeare (definitely not me). All in all, it's maybe worth half the price I paid for it.  Anyone wanna buy my copy?",1093046400,22,625,4.75
