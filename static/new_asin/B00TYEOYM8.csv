8703307,5,B00TYEOYM8,Great show but I was very disappointed with the DVDs. I've been waiting since season 1 first aired for the DVD sets so they finally had them and I bought them however there are no subtitles with the discs and the audio is not good enough to watch it without them as I have a hearing loss and need the subtitles. I can't say if they're formatted with closed caption which once DVD players were hooked up with an HDMI cable captions no longer translated so they had to format discs with subtitles not closed caption!,1527984000,,514,4.364583333333333
8703308,5,B00TYEOYM8,"I haven't watched all of these yet, but am eager to get to them.  I love this series!!  You know from the beginning who the killer and victims are. However it's totally amazing how the writers weave the story to understand how these two people ended up together, and it's a situation where you can't imagine how they did.",1501632000,,321,4.423728813559322

8703311,5,B00TYEOYM8,Exactly what I was looking for but never knew it would take 2 years to find nor that the only place I could find it was the UK.,1479081600,,127,3.5714285714285716
8703312,5,B00TYEOYM8,"I love this series!  I'm a huge fan of crime shows, especially the British/UK/Australian shows.  Not so much of the American shows and I don't watch very many of them.  I managed to catch a few episodes of this show when one of the networks was carrying it for a while. But, then they got stupid and ""cancelled"" it while the Canadians were smart and continued for 2 more seasons.

As I'm sure other reviewers have told you, the premise of the show is to tell you who both the killer and the victim is, with lots of flashbacks, which can get a bit confusing at times.  However, the show is quite addicting and I'm disappointed it didn't continue past 4 seasons.

I watched the last two seasons online via the USA website, but it comes across as jerky and the image jumps around.  I'm really hoping the third and fourth seasons will come out on DVD so I can watch the show the way it should be seen (without commercials and without the image jumping around).

Do yourself a favor, if you haven't already, purchase a region-free DVD player so you can watch this show.  You won't regret it!",1475107200,,1086,4.39
