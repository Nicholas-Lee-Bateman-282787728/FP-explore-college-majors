8428646,2,B004GEB5ZK,"I have seen no better a portrayal of the idle rich in this so-called United Kingdom, not that it is any worse then those in the United States. A Good portrait of the Bad and the Ugly",1504396800,,182,3.945945945945946
8428647,2,B004GEB5ZK,"Really bad. Just awful. Desite big developments with a few main characters,  the ending felt hurried and incomplete.",1501286400,,116,5.444444444444445
8428648,5,B004GEB5ZK,Great plot. Great acting. Fascinating how it all develops. If in English could have been a big success,1484697600,,102,4.722222222222222
8428649,2,B004GEB5ZK,"Gist of the movie- One CAN get away with murder if one has money, status and equally amoral friends to back one up! I understand that it is reality, but I don't watch movies to get a glimpse of reality- for that I can just read the news. All in all, would not recommend this one if one is looking for a feel good ending where the bad guy gets what he deserves.",1484179200,,360,3.9452054794520546
8428650,1,B004GEB5ZK,Titties in the first 5 minutes! What's not to like???,1482796800,,53,4.4
8428651,5,B004GEB5ZK,I remember this as a goodie from way back.  Released in 1992.  The morals are a little confronting but  I am sure it is so.,1418083200,,123,3.84
8428652,5,B004GEB5ZK,Being a HUGE Gabriel Byrne fan this movie did not disappoint me. It is almost like a recreation of Fatal Attraction!,1359936000,,116,4.571428571428571
8428653,5,B004GEB5ZK,"I had been looking so hard for this movie with Gabriel Byrne. So glad I could find it here although with a different title (in my first searches I had it as ""Dark Obsession 1989"")",1355875200,,179,4.142857142857143
8428654,3,B004GEB5ZK,"Having waited years to be able to get this rare film on DVD and only having the UK VHS, I was pleased to order this. But the quality is not great- occasional shaky picture, colour below standard and not the sharpness of picture you would expect on a standard DVD transfer. Amazon have wrongly said on here that the ""studio"" (or ""label"") is Film 4- wrong! It has been recorded by AMAZON themselves on DVD-R. Unlike the new range of rare films such as ""The World, The Flesh and The Devil"" with Harry Belafonte which Warner have put out on DVD-R, this one is below standard. I thought for some time after I watched it as to whether to return it to amazon for a refund or keep it & as I rate it 6/10 & the quality is just o.k then I'll keep it as it is in the correct widescreen ratio & is better than nothing! But be warned!",1311984000,4,821,4.105590062111801
