Can't navigate around the dvd like you should be able to.",1335312000,,183,4.228571428571429
8283368,4,B001BKKU2G,"Pam is very patient in showing the watermelon carving. She takes slower step by step to show the basic water melon carving. While she carves, she is very patient in showing slower motion and detailed techniques for carving. She offers tips and frequently asked question solution. I improved my carving 100% just after watching her video. Still practise makes perfect. She offered 3 full detailed carving. I hope she offers more carvings techniques than the 3 she showed. The three carving have opened up my perpective on watermelon carving. If you wanted to do an impressive watermelon, this is the one to start. I had this DVD on my wish list for 2 years and finally bought it. It's worth every penny for me. I should have bought them earlier and gave me more practise. This is a great video for beginners. She shows the basic technique on using knives, setting up the watermelon and offers tips while she carving.",1279670400,,915,4.725
