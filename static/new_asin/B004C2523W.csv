4324382,2,B004C2523W,"I probably would have rated this 3 or even 4 stars if the storyline was more original.  The movie's beginning and end appear to have the same message which reminded me of the movie ""When Trumpets Fade"".  That just ruined what I thought was an ""ok"" movie at best.",1338508800,6,262,4.326530612244898
4324383,5,B004C2523W,I REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING THIS MOVIE ALOT ABOUT. IT IS WHAT I WANTED. I AM INTO HISTORICAL AND MILITARY MOVIES.,1325808000,,111,4.6
4324384,2,B004C2523W,"If you are an avid collector of all things World War 2, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to own this movie. However, you want to be aware of a few things. First off, this is an independent film production, so if you are expecting Band of Brothers/Saving Private Ryan pyrotechnics, then you will be disappointed. Battle scenes, while effective in certain spots, clearly feel as if you are watching re-enactors in action. The grenade and mortar effects are mediocre and that's being kind. At times, it barely passes for the real thing and mostly at other times, it sounds like M-80's going off. The script is passable-decent for a film of this budget. However, the problem in this movie is the delivery of these lines by some of the actors in this movie. Derek Simmons is a decent enough actor who does not embarass himself. However, Paul Wendell who plays Sgt. Bowen, could be the most God-awful actor on the face of the planet. It is amazing to me that the director did not fire him on the spot. This guy's voice and delivery has to be the most forced representation of what an actor think's a battle hardened Sgt. would be like. However, to be fair to him, some of the other actors do not get a free pass. There are a few laughable outbursts from these guy's that are supposed to illustrate the horror of combat but instead made me want to cringe in embarassment for them.

Having said all this, there is a bizarre sense of sincerity throughout all these proceedings from all involved that do not make this film a total failure. It does have it's moments and that is enough to give it 2 stars. While you could find better independent or out of the mainstream war films such as Saints and Soldiers, Days of Glory or Zvezda/The Star, it would not be a total loss for you if you decided to make this purchase.",1324425600,9,1818,4.4431137724550895
4324385,2,B004C2523W,"This is a very realistic movie.  Uniforms, weapons, people, and equipment. The ""Not Rated"" for this movie is not very helpful, true it is not rated but the language is very foul.  If this does not bother you, Rhineland is great movie.",1310688000,4,234,4.5476190476190474
4324386,4,B004C2523W,"88mm Productions presents ""RHINELAND"" (2007) (93 min/Color) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Director Chris Grega was able to put it all together with an ambitious cast and some clever writing --- This is not a Hollywood film, but a small film company with some very impressive scenes of how it was during 1945.

Grega's solid direction and top notch acting with three main characters - Derek Simmons, R. Travis Estes and Paul Wendell paints a portrait of those WWII years -- The whole cast played well and made us a believe that they were going into the bowels of hell.

This director seems destined for bigger and better things --- Just a great film portraying the misery and confusion of war.

4324387,2,B004C2523W,"I viewed this film on a pre-release DVD edit and thought it was well put together for such a limited budget.  There are some technical issues regarding uniforms and equipment that a purist historian will have problems with, but considering the majority of extras are World War 2 reenactors who receive little or no compensation, one can easily overlook these issues.  The acting isn't that good and the story moves at a terribly slow pace, but cast members attempt to provide convincing portrayals of US soldiers fighting in 1944-45 Europe.  Would this film earn any major awards? Probably not, but if you accept it for exactly what it is, a low budget independent film produced outside St Clair Missouri, then you will enjoy your viewing experience.",1296086400,28,750,4.936507936507937

8422671,5,B004C2523W,"A very good movie. One of the best war movies I've ever seen. If you are like me, as I like a war movie minus the drama. Only containing scenes as though you were actually there on the battlefield seeing and hearing bullets zip past you. Ducking as the shells explode near you. Well worth the money.",1406332800,,299,4.2631578947368425

Acting left a lot to be desired also.

Accurate use of period costumes.",1379030400,,112,4.333333333333333

8422674,4,B004C2523W,"After buying this movie I was more than pleased, but also driven to see it after the two negative reviews from Canada that appear to be written by the same person.  For the historian and uniform expert you will be in heaven with respect to the German impressions and vast equipment employed.  One of the things that jumped out to me was the calculated effort to keep the camera on the real actors to follow the story vs using the re-enactors fill the void of film footage needed.......as with such movies as ""Brothers War"" and ""The Red Rose of Normandy"".  Actually I felt the actors in Rhineland were good/professional and convincing, and the plot was historically realistic to the enthusiast.  Yes I would recommend it to the war enthusiast.",1351209600,,742,4.728682170542636
8422675,1,B004C2523W,"Okay,Rhineland 45 was a total emberrasment.the movie is cheaply made and very uninteresting not to mention the shacky cam effect gave me flashbacks of a hangover gone bad. The actors suck and the director is totally inept at getting actors that for one are believable. These actors ARE NOT and if i had been the sarge i would have sent them all through the mindfield with blindfolds on including the sarge as it would have been more interesting than the drival that was served up here on this mess of a movie. Rhineland 45 is a tragic excercise on how not to make a movie and concidering its billed as an epic i would say not even close. To me this movie was a dud and a fraud from the start and was very disappointed considering all the really decent war films out there. Personally i think the director should of had aliens come down and kill everyone,i think that would have been more fun than this slop. Unfortunaltly this film even though i tried to give it a second chance didn't even make the 10 minute mark and i turned the agony off.this war film  won't be making the grade or the collection. Darts anyone.",1348704000,2,1115,4.412621359223301
8422676,4,B004C2523W,"Great Film! Shot on a modest budget, Rhineland Spins a gritty tale. While watching this movie it throws you into a war no one wants to be in. You follow a cowardly private, barely hanging on as his world falls in around him. I was impressed with the Battle sequences. Not as flashy as a Hollywood film, but for an independent film this movie is fantastic. Honestly after reading a lot of reviews for this movie I can see why people would pick apart things like this. But I  say this, I hate watching movies with ""people"" who blurt out, ""that's not a period rifle"" or ""that kilt was only worn by the McSosandso clan."" Really? It is a film, and a damn good one. I look forward to the future work of the 88mm Production team.",1340409600,,722,4.2700729927007295
