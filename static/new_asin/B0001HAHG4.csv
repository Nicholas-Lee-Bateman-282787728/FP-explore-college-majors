8012775,4,B0001HAHG4,"Fans of Abbott & Costello are to be happy to own Diamond Entertainment's 2-pack Collector's Edition DVD!!! These are not the boys' classic films made at Universal,but mostly public domain stuff that we've seen over a hundred times by now that includes the two classic public domain A&C films: AFRICA SCREAMS (1949) and their first color film appearance JACK AND THE BEANSTALK (1952),and five episodes of their famous COLGATE COMEDY HOUR shows from the early '50's!! The print quality on AFRICA SCREAMS is outstanding as is the audio,compared to shoddy and poorly-made VHS and DVD releases!!! JACK AND THE BEANSTALK has a so-so,but good picture quality as well as its color sequences (this film was NOT filmed in three-strip technicolor,but in early Eastmancolor) which are at times varible,depending on the articles of clothing and set designs. But the audio sounds better compared to many VHS and DVD versions! To finish off Disc one,an episode of CCH is featured with guest star Charles Laughton,who appeared in ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEETS CAPTAIN KIDD (1953).The second disc is four complete episodes of the COLGATE COMEDY HOUR with guest stars Jane Russell,Errol Flynn,Tony Curtis,George Raft,Louis Armstrong,and Rhonda Fleming. All of the shows feature their original sponser ads,including Colgate Toothpaste and Lux Soap to name a few (a bit of nostalgia for TV fans!!) and run close to an hour. Print quality on most of the shows are good,but at times dark,but the audio is great,especially for a early '50's television show!! This is a great Abbott & Costello DVD collection and I urge any fan of the comedy duo to buy this for your collection as you will enjoy seven and a half hours of classic,vintage A&C like you've never seen or heard before!!! Outstanding job to Diamond Entertainment for putting together a great set and for cleaning up both picture and sound!!! Avoid Madacy's or UAV's version's of both AFRICA and BEANSTALK!!!",1086912000,15,1939,5.081504702194358
