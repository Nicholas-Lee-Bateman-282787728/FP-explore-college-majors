7342463,5,B011UMI1ZC,"Great series and production values. This was a dedicated effort by a gentleman named John Ellis who without his tremendous effort to get these produced, they would never have seen the light of day since 1959. All three volumes are fantastic, and if you love 1950s aviation like I do, or remember watching this as a kid, you will truly enjoy this series!",1443312000,2,353,4.619047619047619
7342464,5,B011UMI1ZC,"When I first got into the Steve Canyon TV series there were already two volumes out. On the website for the series you could find clips, background info and trailers for certain episodes. There was a trailer for one episode contained in volume 3 called ""Operation Intercept"". A totally random and unfortunate accident causes the death of the crew of a bomber in mid-flight.  It's up to Steve and the command staff to figure out what to do as the ghost bomber heads towards the USSR. That really looked like a doozy! Well it took a while to finally be able to see it and you know what? It was well worth the wait. In fact all the episodes were worth the wait.
Dean Fredericks brings a sincerity and gravitas to the show where others might play it up too heroically or too Rambo. He is even headed and thoughtful in all of his varied situations. And there are many situations as each episode is stand alone and Steve is thrust into completely different stories as he jets around the world fixing problems week by week.
The visuals, the story telling, the acting and staging all lead up to this fact: this is really a great show.  Even if you are not a big fan of the USAF, you might become a fan after watching a lot of these episodes. In fact I became a fan of the various types of 1950s aircraft shown in the show, especially the f102 Delta Daggar and f106 Delta Dart.
As every review has mentioned but bears reminding, the transfers here are excellent. The source prints were in fair condition and brought to excellent status by a meticulous restoration process. There are comparison videos which you should check out of the before and after. Suffice to say the video looks great as does the packaging.
Highly recommended!",1443139200,2,1723,4.501597444089457

7342466,5,B011UMI1ZC,"Filmmaker John Ellis took on the daunting job of restoring this long-neglected TV series; the results of every bit of his workmanship show up brilliantly onscreen. The episodes look as though they were first broadcast last week, with picture and sound all superbly clear. It's an adventure in time-travel, and well worth the viewer's time. highly Recommended!",1443139200,2,359,5.315789473684211
7342467,5,B011UMI1ZC,"This collection is well done!  The video and audio quality of each episode is excellent, and the show itself is a lot of fun!

The entire series is available for purchase on DVD for the first time since it's original broadcast back in 1958 and 1959, all 34 episodes.

If you are an Air Force buff, or loved the Steve Canyon comic strip, or remember the TV show from it's original broadcast, I highly recommend that you purchase all 3 volumes!  I have enjoyed every episode and am very happy that I own this.",1442534400,2,507,4.361702127659575
7342468,5,B011UMI1ZC,"Wow!  This is outstanding - the final volume of a three-voulme collection is finally ready.
John Ellis has been working beyond most people's willingness to sustain an effort, to see this project
come to fruition.  If you have not yet bought this, or for that matter the previous two volumes, do so now.
The picture clarity is stunning, like it was done two days ago.  Right out of the period of
broadcast history when writing, acting, everything was expected to be very good, when viewers
were able to select from any number of high quality material, as compared to today's marketplace,
which is like ""dumpster-diving"".  Don't miss this!!",1442534400,2,638,4.87962962962963
7342469,5,B011UMI1ZC,I have just watched the first 4 episodes!  Damn it is such a creative show!  Half hour drama's are so difficult to write and direct!  Won't say which one?  No spoilers here.  You will see a story that's rarely or never been done in TV history ?  The censors must have missed it.,1442016000,2,278,4.150943396226415
7342470,5,B011UMI1ZC,This is a great work of restoration which revives the extremly rare aeronautical serials of the time especialy American planes for years 1950/60!!!Quel pity it's over! Sincerly thanks!,1440979200,2,184,5.607142857142857
7342471,5,B011UMI1ZC,"Superlatives can't adequately describe ""The Complete Steve Canyon on TV: Volume 3."" To say ""It's finally here!"" and ""It's well worth the wait"" doesn't even scratch the surface of the praise due John Ellis, of the Milton Caniff Estate, for his magnificent achievement in bringing this long-lost TV series to DVD. John almost single-handedly tackled this project and saw it through to its successful conclusion, despite years of problems, issues and setbacks that would have brought lesser men to their knees. The result of his Herculean labors is a fantastic piece of aviation and broadcast TV history. The long delay between the releases of the first two volumes and this, the final one, is over, and now the entire series of 34 episodes is available.

John meticulously and professionally restored the 11 half-hour, black-and-white episodes in this set from the original 35mm film broadcast masters. The episodes originally aired between March and May 1959. They look as good on these DVDs as they ever did, and show no visible effects from the passage of more than five decades. They're exceptionally crisp and sharp, with excellent contrast and superb video and audio quality. All have fascinating, authoritative audio commentary tracks, and most include ABC promo spots and vintage cigarette commercials, a jarring jolt of nostalgia for the days when everybody smoked on television shows and tobacco companies were major sponsors.

The production values of the DVDs and the packaging design and materials are superior. And the episodes themselves? In a word, they're superb. As in Volumes 1 and 2, each show in Volume 3 is an unforgettable dramatic treat. This volume includes, at last, the most-anticipated Steve Canyon episode of all time, the one that almost everyone who ever saw it remembers--the haunting ""Operation Intercept."" Each episode is an immensely enjoyable half-hour escape into a retro-world of roaring afterburning jets, imminent danger in the air and on the ground, and steely-eyed pilots and their ""girl-next-door"" sweethearts. This is the kind of really great ""right stuff"" that you just don't see on television today.

I have never recommended anything more enthusiastically and unequivocally than I do ""The Complete Steve Canyon on TV: Volume 3""--and, of course, the companion Volumes 1 and 2. If you remember watching this series as a child, your purchase should be a no-brainer. If not, you should still give it a try. There has never been anything like it on television, and there never will be again.

Many thanks and a hearty ""Cheers!"" to John Ellis on behalf of all the Steve Canyon fans out here. Well done, John!",1438819200,9,2647,5.134570765661253

8725117,5,B011UMI1ZC,"I stumbled into the STEVE Canyon Project back in, say..2005? There was a sample DVD with four restored episodes of this series from my childhood I had seen first run and once in re-runs the following year..1958-1959. Never again since then...NBC erred in cancellation of the series just as it was taking off...no pun intended, but there it is! Steve Canyon was the comic strip hero from Milton Caniff and it was a great success. So much so that TV came calling for it, and Caniff and Universal Studios gave them and us a quality program!  I would love to see somebody in Hollywood today get the bug to bring Steve to the big screen! Tom Cruise likes hanging off airplanes, maybe he'd produce if not star in a feature film? Ah,.. Just dreaming...
 Back to the topic, that lone sample DVD led me to seek the entire series as it was slowly and perfectly restored. It took the best part of ten years by one man, John Ellis, who has put his health and literally home and livelihood on the block to accomplish this magnificent accomplishment. Now, it is available to all of us. And it's up to all of us to pay John back by buying his product. Right NOW. Due to a breakdown of a planned cooperative venture, Ellis has done the restoration literally by himself, on his own dime! Sure he had some folks loyally assisting him, but what you see is due to his striving to make the product as perfect as possible and true to the intentions and efforts of Milton Caniff and the cast and crew members of the series from half a century ago! Read the other reviews for more insight and praise. I noted that NOWHERE is there a criticism of the product. It is worthy of your support. If you are reading this and the other reviews available, PLEASE, don't hesitate to order this true piece of aviation and entertainment history!",1443312000,,1808,4.459214501510574
8725118,5,B011UMI1ZC,Well worth the wait!  Great episodes and bonus features!  BEST cover of the set and Mark Ellis put a lot of hard work and love into the entire restoration of the series!  Bravo!  This is the way a television series should be released.  Love all of the network material and commercials!,1443312000,2,285,4.509803921568627
