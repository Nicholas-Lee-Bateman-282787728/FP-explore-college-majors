1085776,5,6305807914,"Hammer studios mostly known for Horror made other excellent movies and here are two of them. I have them on VHS so I can't comment on
the quality of the DVD but I know this is out of print and hard to find which is why so expensive. So the first one Abominable Snowman stars
Forest Tucker and Peter Cushing and both are great together. One a big game hunter and other a scientist both out to find the first Big Foot.
But Tucker wants to capture the beast and Cushing just wants to confirm it exist. They find the beast and there is some action and suspense
but no blood or horror! In fact they kept the 'beast' from being seen except for his hand in one part and then their faces in last part of movie.
It's done very well and better than any picture Hollyweird could make with blood and gore. Shatter is Stuart Whitman as a agent or hired hit
man who gets involved in some shady deal in Hong Kong with Peter Cushing playing another villain who is trying to kill him. It has plenty of
action and kung fu fighting and just a very good movie but not typical for Hammer Horror fans. I recommend both of these movies.",1453680000,,1113,4.181395348837209

Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.

This exceptional film succeeds in bringing this quote to life. for fans of the film I recommend picking up a copy of Chamber Of Darkness #7 which features ""I found the Abominable snowman"". A great follow up reworking of the Abominable snowman story, as well as the classic night of the gargoyle by Bernie Wrightson.
""I found the Abominable snowman"" was first published in Tales to Astonish #13 along with GROOT, but chamber has a better line up of stories.",1412640000,,582,4.650485436893204

This is not only a eerie and suspenseful film with some great acting, great directing by Val Guest, some great visuals, some very scary yeti, very suspenseful moments, but like all of Kneale's stories, it's also intellectual and thought-provoking making this more than just a great horror flick.

1085842,5,6305807914,"5 Stars = Masterpiece

One of the first & best horror films ever put out by famed British, Hammer Studios, was not a reworking of a Universal's classic monster movie. It was a film of a long told classic mythical beast, ""The Abominable Snowman,"" or as it was originally titled, ""The Abominable Snowman of the Himalaya,"" which I find a much more befitting title to this masterful piece of atmospheric dread.

Shot in eerie black & white, this is the tale of Dr. John Rollason, (Peter Cushing) who has long been looking for the fabled ""Yeti"" in the Himalaya. It is also the story of Tom Friend, (Forrest Tuker) who accompanies the good doctor with a party of mountaineers, a big game hunter, & Sherpas, to climb the dizzying cold isolated heights of the peaks above them in search of the fabled Yeti. Unbeknownst to Dr. John Rollason, Tom Friend has an hidden agenda, he wants a Yeti, dead or alive, to bring back to civilization. Tom Friend is a profiteering American showman, & he'll do anything to claim his prize. So here our story starts, at the palace of the High Lhama, who tries to persuade the team of men from looking for the Yeti, by claiming, it is but a myth.

""The Abominable Snowman"" seethes with the eerie lonesomeness of the high Himalaya. It's beautiful, yet stark black & white cinematography, captures the true cold hopelessness of this film, filling it with atmospheric dread that few horror films ever achieve. It's equally foreboding somber soundtrack, accompanies the film like foot steps in a dark alley behind you, you look, & nobody is there, your scalp tingles as you anticipate the unknown. This is one of the great strengths of this film, the unknown! Another is it's storyline, & the very credible acting that comes with it, especially Peter Cushing as the protagonist & Forrest Tucker as the antagonist. Here we have the classic battle of good & evil, of two strong wills, both wanting the same thing, the Yeti, but using it in different ways. It's the story of two men driven by ambition, at any cost. It's the story of man, the monster, who thinks he is hunting a monster, but finds out that he is the real monster, & he is the one being hunted!

Absolutely astoundingly eerie dread filled scenes haunt this film. Yes, haunt! It's what you can't see that gives this film the potent aura of impending doom. A cry high above the men in the mountains, echoing lonely through the peaks. The sound of a team member's voice calling out from the snow filled desolation of night, the only problem, he's dead. Sounds of heavy footsteps creeping around the tent. All of this & more, make ""The Abominable Snowman"" a film that you will not forget!

If you even have the least bit interest in Hammer Studios, & how horror films that dig into your psyche through the unseen, can be much more potent than horror films that throw everything at you at once, then this is your film!

Oh, & one more thing, it has an ending that will stand your hair on end! A 10 on the creep factor!",1359590400,3,2996,4.549165120593692

It is a total psychological nightmare for an expedition in search of proof of living Yeti, and what overpowers them is none other than themselves.

1085897,4,6305807914,"I am an admitted Hammer film lover. I even enjoy thier bad movies. This is not a bad movie at all. But it is not the ussual blood and sex that got them thier reputation. This is an early attempt to break into the sci-fi field. It is based on a tv show done by Nigel Kneale for the BBC.
The six part series was condensed down to 90 minutes and directed by Val Guest. The movie stars Forest Tucker and Peter Cushing as the leads. It is very economic in budget and very large on suspense. It will not scare you but keep you on edge wondering exactly what is going on.
If you like Hammer or are into 50s sci-fi I highly recommend this title for your collection. The transfer and sound are very good and I have used my version for several viewings with no issues.",1327363200,,758,4.093959731543624

1085902,5,6305807914,"Taking something that doesn't belong to you is one thing. Taking it from monks - even if it is just knowledge - is another. This is what a group of people find out as they travel into the frozen depths of nothing, looking for the catch of the century - all for their own reasons. As they do, they realize that they have not only done something quite stupid but that they, like most people, have not fully prepared for the prey they are going after.

While this movie isn't considered one of the great hits of its day, I recall it as a child and remember how frightening it seemed. It had great acting that you can spot from its specific period, and you can tell exactly what is going to happen as the wrong feet tread on some rather sacred toes.

The special effects - though limited for their time - were something that really marvels. I recal seeing a hand reaching into a tent in the middle of a snowstorm and thinking how horrible that would be, and I remember seeing the snowman bearing down on people who didn't calculate weather into their superior planning. This meant that they were all going to have some problems on the wrong end of the Yeti stick - and they were going to have it with minimal effects that seem to maximize results.

For fans of Hammer films and other classics from this era, this film is a gem. It was hard to find for quite some time and now, seeing it here and laid out so lovingly, I really can't say buy it enough. Fans of this type of movie will love it and, if you have yet to see it, you are in for a treat.
A superb cast, actors of caliber playing small roles that yield high results, and a creature that seems to be quite in its element - all things that are pretty nice when added up. My type of a good time.",1276646400,,1747,4.162721893491124
1085903,5,6305807914,"An English expedition sets out through the Himalayas in order to capture the elusive yeti in this top-rate Hammer release. THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN transplants the classic Gothic stylings of the Universal monster movies into the snowy peaks of modern Tibet. The film poses many stark contrasts, not just in the gorgeous black and white cinematography, but also in the thematic concepts of man versus nature, knowledge versus ignorance, science versus superstition, and other clashes between New World thoughts and ancient beliefs. Cushing and company provide the same excellent performances that Hammer has become known for, while the elaborate and exotic sets share the same intricacy in design found in both CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN and HORROR OF DRACULA. Another similarity to Hammer's FRANKENSTEIN film can be found in the fact that the majority of the picture plays out without so much as a peak at the creature, leaving the audience in a constant state of tension as subtle allusions towards its existence are experienced through the characters' reactions. This makes the sudden appearance of the beast's hairy, gnarled arm that much more terrifying when it first protrudes from the tent bottom. Director Val Guest also achieves a heightened sense of realism by effortlessly blending the stunning aerial photography of real climbers making their way through the Himalayas with believable set pieces created in the legendary Bray Studios. Several key pieces of dialog reveal the film's bleak commentary on man's self-destructive tendencies as the climbers become the sources of their own demise while the yeti proves to be nothing more than a benign animal cornered by man's imposing curiosity. With a heart-racing score, breathtaking visuals, and masterful suspense, THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN truly is one of Hammer's finest and most underrated creations.

1085904,5,6305807914,"I have to say, I was skeptical about picking up this movie in DVD-R form.  But given the choice between overpaying for the original DVD release, or trying this, I made the right decision.  Thankfully, the movie played and looked great!  It's very hard to tell this was not the genuine original except for the mildly fuzzy main menu and Hammer Films Peter Cushing extra (parts of that extra were pixilated at points).  Everything worked well, and the movie, which is the main thing, didn't have any problems and came across vividly.

And if you haven't seen this film, you're missing out.  It's a very even keel horror/suspense movie.  Peter Cushing, as always, did a phenomenal job of coming across as the sophisticated hero.  Along with Forrest Tucker, the movie is believable, especially given it was made in the 1950's.  You really feel like you are going on the search for the creature, but nothing about the film is overdone.  It's just a classic well made film!",1264118400,7,967,4.736526946107785

1085906,1,6305807914,"I was so glad when on a whim one day I noticed that old Hammer horror titles previously released by Anchor Bay Entertainment appeared to be getting a re-release. Boy, was I wrong about that! Don't be fooled. DVD-R's are no substitute for a real factory manufactured product. The pictures appear murky, bleeding and washed out even though its obviously a direct burn from a genuine Anchor Bay DVD. The sound drops in and out. I played each disc on 3 different players manufactured by 3 different companies. In all I wasted $20 dollars a piece on 3 of these pathetic knock offs. Originally when I purchased these titles there was NO mention of them being bootleg quality DVD-R's. I don't know who's ingenious idea it was to propose such a gross misuse of wasted effort. Either shame on Anchor Bay or shame on Amazon for perpetuating such poor quality knock offs at such an absurd price. They even use the original Anchor Bay DVD's cover art printed by a laser printer however most of the special features listed will not appear.

I.E. - The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires does not include the U.S. cut of the film as mentioned.

What a crime in itself either release the film correctly or don't bother at all. What a tease. What a waste of my money and time.

The movie had this been a genuine product released through Anchor Bay would've received 5 stars.

I threw my money away on:

Dracula Prince Of Darkness

Frankenstein Created Woman

The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires

1085951,3,6305807914,"I recently watched this movie, having seen it originally many years ago. I'll admit, my memory did not due it justice. I found it much better now than I did as a teenager. No expense was spent in the making of this movie. No fancy sets, no special effects, no great camera angles. Just simple story telling and yet very effective and satisfying. I've always appreciated Peter Cushing as an actor and he turns in another fine performance here. Forrest Tucker - tho never to be mistaken for Laurence Olivier, was competent in an undemanding but vital role to the film. This appears to be a one camera film, with the camera moving as the scenes cut. So there are no multiple angles. Not a problem. From my childhood memories I thought I recalled a different ending, in which Tucker turned out to be a Yhetti himself disguised as a human. Am I confussing this with another movie, possibly another one he did? In any event, that is not the ending of this movie. The story is simple and somewhat moralistic. Action is decent for single location and no special effects. Overall not a bad way to spend 90 minutes. I would recommend this for anyone who is a movie buff.

Not sure if this is in fact a DVD-R or if somehow Anchor Bay did something for a fast buck on this reissue -- those questions barely matter. What I will tell you is that comparing this with a knock-off copy I somehow inherited (fah!), the quality is striking here! If it's a copy of the Anchor Bay edition, it's an exact copy, right down to the menu and World of Hammer featurette extra.

This is an unusual horror picture to be sure, a noiry, atmospheric black and white jewel, glistening in the snow. It would make an awesome double-bill with Jacques Tourneur's 1958 Curse of the Demon, in that both films veer away from straight hokum horror into more intellectually satisfying atmospheres -- without ever becoming pretentious or dull. I won't spoil any of Abominable Snowman's surprises for you here, but if you're a Hammer fan, a Peter Cushing fan, and a fan of old school, B&W British atmospherics that drip mood, don't wait one second longer.

1085956,3,6305807914,"The three star rating here isn't for the film, which is one of Hammer's finest early films.  It's for the DVD.  Read the description carefully and be advised - This is NOT a DVD, but a DVD-R.  I don't know who makes it, but despite what Amazon says, and what the case liner says, it most certainly ISN'T Anchor Bay, who apparently no longer have the rights to distribute the Hammer films.  The genuine Anchor Bay copy is on Amazon too, at the usual ridiculous astronomical scalper prices - $516.76 REALLY! This DVD-R, with the usual blurry copy of the cover sheet, and a generic label on the disk, is almost certainly an illegal copy.

Having said that however, it's also apparently copied from the genuine disk, as it looks virtually identical.  The picture isn't quite as good as the real one (which I have), but it's not bad.  A bit darker and less sharp, but by no means bad.  About what you'd expect from a copy of the original.  Everything is exactly the same, and all the extras are there - the commentary etc., so if you don't feel like selling your house to get a genuine copy, which is rather hard to get now, this is an OK choice.  Just know what you're getting.

As for the film itself - As I said, it's one of Hammer's best of the first wave, having been made the same year as Curse of Frankenstein.  Not exactly horror, nor quite science fiction, but somewhere in between.  With a literate script by Nigel Kneale from his own BBC teleplay version, (which also starred Cushing, but with Stanley Baker instead of Forrest Tucker as Tom Friend, and which like so many other BBC productions of the time, sadly no longer exists,) the film has good pacing and the usual fine performance from Cushing, and from Tucker as well.  Filmed in Hammerscope (2.35:1) I believe it was their first really widescreen film, the other early horrors being shot 1.66:1.  And it was (wisely I believe) shot in black and white, which adds to the eerie atmoshpere of the setting, on the snowy Himalayan peaks.  Avoiding showing the creature outright adds an air of mystery, and the film treats it's subject matter with respect.  It is probably the only film about the Yeti which is any good, not that there are that many.  It's definetely worth owning.  I'd give the film four stars, the DVD-R three.",1242864000,65,2288,4.523114355231144

Having the creature lurking in the background, mostly unseen, gave the feel of the first Alien movie (not an exact analogy, of course).

By all accounts, it was wonderful to be a part of the Hammer Family. The sets depicting the Himalayas are very atmospheric.  The location footage, shot in the French Pyrenees, is also excellent.  The director is the very talented Val Guest.

  ""The Abominable Snowman"" is a perfect blend of science fiction and horror and was created by those who brought us the highly successful Quatermass films.  It stars Hammer horror icon Peter Cushing as a botanist and Forrest Tucker (Sergeant O'Rourke from the TV series ""F Troop"") as a trapper.

  Released in 1957, ""The Abominable Snowman"" was filmed in black and white.  Pity it couldn't have been shot in color as were the Hammer horror classics, ""Horror of Dracula, ""The Mummy,"" and ""The Curse of Frankenstein.""  However, since the beautiful, snow covered Himalayans serve as the backdrop for most all of the film, I doubt if color would have helped.  Black and white gave it more of a gothic feel.

  Only one gruesome death occurred.  A man falls from a steep cliff and strikes a large rock before being slung aside.  A few more gruesome deaths would have been necessary to keep the attention span of a younger generation.  However, the Yeti are not bent on mayhem and destruction.  They merely wish to live in peace while keeping their existence a secret.

  ""The Abominable Snowman"" is a unique creature feature from Hammer Film Productions.  Some of the scientific theories that are offered seem very plausible.  Perhaps the Yeti are waiting for mankind to become extinct in order to reclaim their rightful place on the earth.  We are the savages, not the Yeti.  We are the ones who declare war on each other simply because our beliefs are different.  The Yeti may not have to wait much longer.

  ""The Abominable Snowman"" is a must see for fans of classic science fiction horror.  It is also highly recommended for fans of Hammer Film Productions and horror legend Peter Cushing.",1220832000,3,1926,4.815950920245399

1086026,4,6305807914,"Nigel Kneale was arguably the most influential figure in UK science fiction during the 1950's and 1960's mostly because he was quick to see the potential in the relatively new medium of TV .The Quatermass serials became must see TV and arguably the first series to provoks animated playground discussion among schoolkids of that era.
This movie has its genesis in a TV series of the same name broadcast on the ITV network on a Saturday night and the movie companies as they did with Quatermass and another serial The Trollenberg Terror leaped on the bandwaggon by making it into a movie -and a decent job they made of it too.
Its core is the conflict between two men who represent opposing points of view. Tom Friend-well played by Forrest Tucker -is an entrepreneurial American who ,on capturing a Yeti in the Himalayas ,sees it as a commercial opportunity ,His opposite numaber ,a botanist Dr Rollason -the always admirable Peter Cushing -wants to learn more about the creature ,and subject it to scientific study .As it turns out the creature has a suprise in store for them both ,revealing unexpected gifts that throws a curve into both their plans.

The movie is studio bound with no attempt to utilise genuine locations and the movie thus looks artificial and the creature is glimpsed only sparingly .It is a talky piece of work and while the script is literate and intelligent this may limit the appeal of the movie to gorehounds out there
It is a gripping and intelligent little movie that has more subtlety than usual in horror pictures of the era and I recommend it to those who like a little cerebral exercise with their creature movies",1196640000,,1647,4.7386759581881535

1086029,3,6305807914,"Alright movie about principled botanist Peter Cushing and unscrupulous adventurer Forrest Tucker tracking down an elusive herd of yetis in the frozen wastelands of the high Himalayas.  Tucker, naturally, wants to ""bring `em back"" and convert the abominable snowmen into heaps of shining gold, while the kindly Cushing wants to study and learn from them.

 And so it's off to the peaks of the Himalayas, with a handful of native guides, a gun slinger (Tucker's pal) and a photographer (Cushing's chum,) and wildly diverging agendas.  I'm not overly familiar with Hammer films, but I have the impression they were a pretty bare bones studio.  You can't tell that from what's on screen, though - the movie starts and ends in a Buddhist monastery, and it's a convincingly ancient retreat.  The movie well integrates some second unit shots taken in the French Pyrenees and larger set large-stage scenes shot at Pinewood Studios.

 Unfortunately, there's a LOT of talking going on as Tucker and Cushing - both good, by the way - endlessly and monotonously yak about the nature of the yeti.  And director Val Guest had decided to give nothing but a couple of unsatisfying teaser shots of the abominable snowmen.  Guest explains in on the commentary track, something about what the viewer could imagine is much more powerful than anything our makeup department could come up with - but he could have dressed a couple three tall stuntmen in monkey suits and take long distance shots of them roaming about the Pyrenees/Himalayas. We do finally see a bit of the `creatures,' but not enough, really.

 And so we're left with a talky, philosophical horror flick that's short on horror but looks good and has a thought provoking point of view.  Despite its severe shortcomings in the terror and horror department, THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN does manage to maintain a low level of suspense - it we don't see the susquashes, we hear them often enough.  If I wouldn't recommend this to the ""make me scared"" horror fans, it is a good one for the family.",1166313600,,2031,4.866279069767442
1086030,5,6305807914,"Not too long ago I sat through schlockmeister Jerry Warren's Man Beast (1956)...last night I watched The Abominable Snowman (1957), written by Nigel Kneale (The Quatermass Xperiment) and directed by Val Guest (The Quatermass Xperiment, The Day the Earth Caught Fire)...the stories in the two films were so similar (although where Kneale and Guest utilized intricate subtleties to pass the crux of their tale along Warren's method involved something akin to beating the audience about the head with a sledgehammer) one might think Warren was the one who got ripped off, but in actuality Kneale and Guest's feature was based off a television feature, written by Kneale, originally aired in 1955, entitled The Creature, one Warren (or his writer) most likely caught prior to cranking out his own abominable snowman movie.  Starring in The Abominable Snowman is Peter Cushing (The Curse of Frankenstein, The Hound of the Baskervilles) and Forrest Tucker (The Trollenberg Terror, Auntie Mame).  Also appearing is Maureen Connell (Kill Her Gently), Richard Wattis (Operation Crossbow), Robert `M' Brown (A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights), Michael Brill (The Camp on Blood Island), Arnold Marl (The Man Who Could Cheat Death), and Wolfe Morris (The House That Dripped Blood), who, along with Cushing and Marl, reprise their roles from the television feature I mentioned previously.

Cushing plays Dr. John Rollason, a botanist currently in the Himalayas with his wife Helen (Connell) and priggish colleague Peter Fox (Wattis) collecting samples of medicinal plants.  In actuality Rollason has an ulterior motive being to hook up with a brash American named Tom Friend who's mounting an expedition to search out the legendary man beast of Tibet, much to Helen's dismay (seems Rollason told his wife he gave up mountain climbing after a previous unfortunate accident).  Friend makes the scene along with an expert tracker and trapper named Ed Shelley (Brown), a photographer named Andrew McNee (Brill), and their guide Kusang (Morris).  After an abstruse warning from the local Llama (Marl), the quintet, traveling lean and mean, make their way up the mountain in search of their quarry.  Along the way they face numerous natural perils (fatigue, treacherous mountain passes, etc.) and Rollason discovers Friend's motives aren't all that pure, as his interest is purely of a commercial nature, which goes against Rollason's academic instincts (Rollason wants to prove the existence of the creatures, while Friend wants to exploit them for monetary gain).  As the group gets close to the area where the creatures might be, McNee begins to hear things (apparently he's the sensitive type) and Rollason postulates perhaps the creatures aren't a missing link, but an offshoot of human development, who may have an intelligence equal to or even superior to our own, and have chosen to exist how and where they do for a specific reason.  After plenty of trudging about in the snow, McNee hurts his foot, Friend and Shelley bag themselves a mountain monkey (Friend's willing to pass it off as a baby Yeti if'n they don't catch the real thing), and their native guide flips his lid and hauls ash down the mountain after a particularly harrowing incident.  Eventually those remaining do locate what they're looking for, but while finding an abominable snowman is one thing, returning with (or without) one a different story...

Whenever I think of the abominable snowman, that Bugs Bunny cartoon featuring the abominable snowman comes to mind (I think it's titled ""The Abominable Snow Rabbit"")...in it the creature is portrayed as a big, doofy moron type whose main interest in Bugs is to keep him as a pet and call him George...suffice to say, the abominable snowman doesn't rank high on my list of frightening horror film characters.  That said I thought this Hammer Studios produced film a most excellent feature as it had a number of things going for it including the following; intelligent writing, solid and flowing direction, healthy production values, strong, well developed characters (especially in the case of Cushing and Tucker), and two extremely capable and experienced leads.  I thought Cushing and Tucker played really well off each other, both playing characters with the same goal, to find a Yeti, but for very different motives...when you think about, despite the differences in motives, both involved exploitation of creatures, which Cushing's character ultimately realizes (who's the real monster on the mountain?), and acts accordingly.  The story does tend to drag a bit for the first forty-five minutes or so, but then things really pick up after once the party reaches their final destination.  One of the more interesting aspects for the feature to me was rarely are the creatures shown, other than perhaps a curious hairy hand or two reaching from underneath a tent flap.  I think it was a good choice not to parade the creatures around as it maintained a mystique, allowing for the audience to develop their own mental picture given the framework provided by the characters on the screen.  Near the end we do get a slightly more detailed visual, but the ephemeral quality is preserved.  I did have two minor gripes about the film the first being I thought it interesting how the only two American characters portrayed in this British feature lacked any seemingly redeemable qualities...I mean here you have Ed Shelley, a tracker and a trapper, with his shoot first, shoot again, and then ask questions mentality along with Tom Friend, the financier of the expedition whose only real goal was that of fame and fortune, even if it meant leaving someone else's cheese out in the wind...despite appearances we're (we referring to Americans) aren't all money grubbing, bloodthirsty, trigger happy a-holes looking out only for our own interests (the current administration certainly isn't helping my claim here)...ah well...the other beef I had was what was up with that photographer character?  What a completely useless individual...I don't remember seeing him take one picture.  Given how his character is portrayed (sniveling and useless sums it up) it's pretty easy to foretell his role in the story.  All in all if you see only one abominable snowman movie in your lifetime, I'd go with this one, as it's the best I've seen so far...

The picture quality, presented in widescreen (2.35:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release, looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through clearly.  As far as extras included there's an audio commentary track with director Val Guest and writer Nigel Kneale, an original theatrical trailer, a World of Hammer episode entitled `Peter Cushing' (24:51), and a 5X7 original poster artwork reproduction insert, the flipside listing the chapter stops.

1086063,4,6305807914,"This two-disc re-release has been out for nearly a year, but hasn't received a proper review yet.  So here goes:

Both of the films on offer were released separately by Anchor Bay several years ago.  Both went out of print as individual releases, but Anchor Bay put them back into print by repackaging them together -- presumably to move stock, but also to do latecomers to the world of DVD a favor.  Anchor Bay has done the same for most of their transfers of British films made by the famed Hammer Studios.  (If you're familiar with MGM's similar line of Midnite Movies, you'll have a sense of what I'm describing.)  Each of the titles in these two-disc sets are exactly the same as the original single-disc releases; only the packaging has changed.

The overall quality of Anchor Bay's work is fine.  They almost always provide excellent progressive transfers of well-preserved film elements -- usually offering nice extras and enhanced anamorphic transfers.  Both of the films here have filmmaker commentaries, theatrical trailers, and half-hour episodes from a ""World of Hammer"" series narrated by Oliver Reed.  (The commentaries are entertaining and worth a listen, but the ""World of Hammer"" episodes are a waste of time, being little more than film clip compilations.)

The films themselves are not very closely related -- except insofar as both were made by Hammer Studios and both feature Hammer regular Peter Cushing.

""The Abominable Snowman"" is a superb fantasy-thriller about an expedition searching for the Yeti in the Himalayas.  It features excellent performances and atmosphere, and a highly intelligent script by Nigel (""Quatermass"") Kneale.  It's similar in style and tone to the atmospheric horror films that Val Lewton made at RKO in the mid-1940s.  I highly recommend ""The Abominable Snowman,"" as it is directed by the vastly underappreciated British B-movie master Val Guest.  This film is worth the price of the set alone (and it's considerably cheaper than tracking down the out-of-print single disc).

""Shatter,"" on the other hand, is a lackluster attempt to cash in on the kung-fu craze.  The idea is actually pretty good:  A hit man is double-crossed after carrying out a job and seeks revenge in Hong Kong.  But despite being shot on location, the production values are just too cheap, and the music, direction, acting, and especially the editing are simply sub-par.  (It's worth watching just to come back for the commentary, which is pretty honest, but don't expect too much.)

You can find fuller reviews for each film under Amazon's listings for the out-of-print releases.  I just wanted to confirm that this set does indeed carry everything the old releases did, and it offers a good deal on ""The Abominable Snowman,"" a film I keep recommending to fans of British cinema or intelligent sci-fi/horror.",1117929600,22,2834,5.073434125269978
1086064,4,6305807914,"This is a very atmospheric and enthralling movie. It's a big departure from most of the Hammer Films in the sense that its basis is on folklore and speculation rather than ""Classic Monster"" genre.

It also contains great shots of the Nepal mountain range and also pays a respect to Himalayan culture and religion.

This is a wise decision for any old monster movie buff or fan of the Hammer Films.

1086065,3,6305807914,"The Abominable Snowman is in a somewhat different vein from much of  the Hammer films of this period.  It aims to be more philosophical rather than horrific and comes across more as a long (too long) Twilight Zone or original Star Trek episode (particularly as the Himalayas looked much like a snowish covered version of the planets in which the crew always seemed to find themselves) which is not what one is necessarily looking for in what was once a feature film.  The actors, particularly, of course, Peter Cushing, do good work and the film has nice intentions in its message but the slow build-up to the story is unnecessary when the time could have been used more effectively to develop the secondary characters and give a litte more back story to the leads, if not actually creating suspense.

1086066,3,6305807914,"This film, much like the Val Lewton-produced movies of the 40s ('Cat People', 'The Seventh Victim'...), belongs to the 'B-cinema of the unseen' - the low budget becomes an asset, and evocating the unknown becomes more important than bluntly showing it. This aspect is especially meaningful here, given the movie's elusive title character. The quest of the film's protagonists symbolizes the general ambition to reach what lies beyond man and his reason; it is the search of mysterious, potentially dangerous knowledge. When the adventurers appear to have reached their goal, deception always ensues and the quest still goes on; the conclusion itself is more open-ended than it may initially seem. It is through the characters' contact with Orient (both its people and environment) that they gradually stop to consider themselves the measure of all things. Man's smallness in the cosmos is illustrated in two ways throughout the film: on the physical plane, Val Guest's widescreen compositions often transform men into ants roaming about in a vast world; on the spiritual plane, the interior scenes show the characters' fears of the unknown take over. Concise and intelligent, this film should be seen.",1081209600,2,1201,5.293193717277487

It pulls your emotions into the story and has you loving, hating, and wanting to throttle the various characters.
I love the psychological tension. You do not have to see the yeti to be afraid. You sense he is always lurking just outside the camera's view. I prefer that to special effects wizardry in creating monsters. I much prefer the psychological tension to the visual scare.

This is an intelligent sci-fi/horror flick that poses probing questions of man vs. nature.  The austere tone of the film is enhanced by the bleak B&W photography, and captures the grim atmosphere of remote Tibet.  Peter Cushing and Forrest Tucker disagree over what to do with the creature, even before capture.  Tucker is American Tom Friend, and his interest is strictly commercial.  Cushing is John Rollason, a dedicated scientist.  Rollason is more interested in solving the scientific conundrum than gaining a profitable circus attraction.  As their expedition reaches distant heights and snowy peaks, strange cries in the night presage tragedy.  The script takes an unusual perspective as it suggests that the yeti are not missing-link predators, but intelligent, superior beings.  Questions of man's relevance vs. nature's inevitability rank this film well above the more common sci-fi/horror schlock of pseudo-science and cheesy special effects.  Soul-searching aside, goosefelsh rises when the men realize that killing one yeti caused a chorus of plaintive wailing across the mountains.  Whatever they are, they are communicating with each other, and they are coming this way.  Darkness and howling winds add to the eerie atmosphere as the expedition succumbs to madness and death.  Ironically, the yeti are passive, and standby as the feeble men self-destruct.  The director suggests terror without overt display.  You may feel compelled to quickly turn and see what lurks behind you.  The film ends on an enigmatic note.

Vasquez Rocks is quickly being circled by the communities in the Santa Clarita Valley.

Peter Cushing stars in what I believe to be one of Hammer's more grand movies, with a superbly sinister and dramatic storyline.  Dr. John Rollason (Cushing)joins a stubborn group of expeditionists on a quest to search for the Yeti. Rollason is one of Cushing's more sympathetic roles (more of the Van Helsing, less of the early Frankenstein), a botanist who leaves his wife at a buddist temple as he goes off to explore the Himalayas for the abominable snowman. Unfortunate is it, then, that he is accompanied by a group of morons with the ""bull in a china shop"" approach to myths and legends.. I mean, haven't they seen King Kong for crying out loud? maybe not. As you can guess, things get a bit pear shaped (it wouldn't be much of a movie if not) and the viewer is subjected to a storyline which keeps you glued to the screen as things get ever more desperate for the seemingly doomed exploration team.  Boasting few effects, the film deliveres an astoundingly eerie feel. Even at the point when they capture one of the creatures you are not given the full view of it, which keeps the mystery element alive right up until the climax of the movie.  The picture quality is quite exceptional for a film of it's age and the soundtrack, although mono, is quite crisp and clear throughout.  In short, if you don't like old movies, why are you reading this? but for avid Cushing fans it's a must.",988156800,9,1541,4.489285714285714

1086134,3,6305807914,"This is a genuinely unnerving horror from hammer, that unusually focuses more on the unseen rather than the seen. This may make it slow at the beginning, but stick with it and there are great rewards. As always with Kneale the themes run thicker than you may think at first, and the statement on mankind is fairly damning. All very thought-provoking and unnerving, this is one of hammer's best efforts, benefiting greatly from Cushing's presence as usual. The dvd picture quality is excellent for such an old film, and the commentary track is as honest and as revealing as one could hope for from director Val Guest and writer Nigel Kneale. The documentary is interesting for the clips of other hammer films, but is as vapid and cheap as every other one in the series.  In summary, Anchor Bay should be congratulated for the extraordinary amount of effort they continue putting into these disks.",982281600,4,895,4.811688311688312
1086135,5,6305807914,"One of my all time favourite movies,ever. The performances of Cushing and Tucker are superb and very believable,and the subject offers Hammer at the time(1957) to approach this topic with a more gentler feel,than most of their subjects of the time I.E Frankenstein & Quatermass.  On the whole this is a very thought provoking and beautiful film,which now thanks to Anchor Bay has an excellent crisp widescreen print.  Nigel Kneale who does commentary on this edition as well as director Val Guest must be very pleased with the outcome of this edition,even if they can't agree to differ over the first 2 Quatermass stories,then at least they can agree over this amazing collaberation being one of their finest.  Also a re-make of a long lost TV show (The Creature 1956),and a BBC production this is definately one to own,so do yourself a favour buy it, then sit back with the lights out and enjoy the truelly haunting story of 'The Abominable Snowman'.",982281600,6,951,4.8580246913580245
1086136,5,6305807914,"""THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN""
This is an unexpectedly involving movie with a great look.
Forrest Tucker is greedy Tom Friend looking for a new side show attraction in this pristine black and white widescreen transfer of a gripping, thoughtful, artistic Hammer Films classic from the 1950s.
Tucker, aided by Peter Cushing's sensitive scientist Dr. Rollason, set off into the Himalayas to find the legendary eponymous creature in a surprisingly intelligent adventure.
Vast, lonely mountain vistas and a large, finely detailed monastery make a believable setting in which the hunters ponder life, their dilemma and the great yeti - who apparently has the ability to play mind games until the hunters become the hunted!
The sound design, including the hair-raising, echoing, whale-like moans of the yeti and the oriental music score add considerably to the authentic atmosphere.
In the entertaining bonus audio track, Droll director Val Guest and writer Nigel Kneale make reference to the similar adventures of millionaire Tom Slick as a source of inspiration.
When it's all over, you will long remember the sad, wise eyes of the snow beast and will have no doubts about who the real monsters are.  This is the best of the sub genre of bigfoot/abominable snowman films.  And yes, there are others.

The lonely mountains and the sombre monastery make for isolated and moody  settings, there dialogue is suitably dark, the characters are all  interesting, notably Peter Cushing's zoologist who broods over the fact  that maybe it's not the yeti who are the real monsters.

1086139,5,6305807914,"I recall seeing this movie as a youngster.  The scenery left me with a sense of the cold, vast desolation of the high mountains, be they Himalayas or Pyrenees.  Growing up in a musical family, the oriental tones of the  sound track lent a memorable air of mystery to the story.  But the real  hook for me was the haunting wail of the Yeti's speech.  In hindsight it  reminds me of whale song, so foreign in its reality and seeming  intelligible to the human ear.  It's almost like hearing a foreign language  dialog for the first time, not knowing the words' meaning but reading so  much from the intonation.  To me the creatures' melancholy wailing gave a  sense of their trying to understand, perhaps cope with the human intrusion.  I found it interesting how the creatures seemed to mete out their own  justice, playing to the character flaws of the of Tucker and his partner in  leading them to their fates.  In the end, despite suffering a loss and  perhaps out of regret for the accidental death of the injured intruder, or  maybe through understanding Cushing's curiosity or even compassion for his  misguided motives leaving him helpless in the mountains, the Yeti rescue  Cushing, leaving him to be found by his wife and colleague.  This merciful  act did much to reinforce the alleged humanity of the creatures while once  more highlighting the hubris of man and his science, a common theme of '50  sci-fi movies.  Finally, the reason I believe this was a movie of the mind  is exactly because megabuck special effects weren't the story.  The acting  protrayed human frailties that often lead to tragic consequencies.  The  music, setting, and minimal special effects played to the human imagination  by tapping into the subconscious dread with which man often faces the  unknown.  The special effects didn't tell me the story.  The movie's  cinematic devices pulled me into the story.  For these reasons I was  thrilled by The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas as a child and still  enjoy it today.  Five stars for good story-telling!",946425600,6,2047,4.820289855072463
1086140,4,6305807914,"When I first of this film, I really thought that it would be a Hammer monster film, but it definitey falls more into science fiction, but very good, intelligent science fiction. Forrest Tucker plays an American showman  who wants to capture a yeti and profit from showing it around.  Tucker and  his small party talk scientist Peter Cushing into joining them.  Eventually  they get a specimen, but they also get a lot more than they bargained for.  The acting is very good, ecspecially Cushing and Tucker.  Remember, Forrest  Tucker was so good in The Crawling Eye that it was almost decent.  The film  did not have a huge budget, but it still looks pretty good and the  widescreen version only helps accenuate the vastness that they want us to  see as the small group is trekking across the snow.  The music also  deserves mention, the strangely eerie eastern music really cathes one's  attention. This is not the Mummy or Horror of Dracula, but it is a good  science fiction film that is more similiar to Forbidden Planet than to  monster movies.",944265600,6,1048,4.701657458563536
