8066152,3,B0009SOJ1O,"""Idomeneo"" deserves a physical presentation more engaging than this production.  Costumes for the chorus look like plastic garbage bags with principals faring only slightly better with the exception of Elettra, the one character in the opera who is given an attractive costume.  Sets just barely suggest the scenes they represent.  Ships, the sea, and sky are the only visual elements of scenery that are interestingly represented.  Poseidon wears nothing but white paint with black smears.  The makeup for the principals and chorus is Kabuki gone bad.

Musically, this is a merely adequate performance of ""Idomeneo"".  In this presentation ""Idomeneo"" is static and feels interminable.  I donated the video to a charitable resale store and replaced it with the Metropolitan Opera, James Levine, 1982 DVD ""Idomeneo"" with Pavarotti, Von Stade, and Behrens in the Jean Pierre Ponnelle production - the opera comes to life in this presentation..",1490140800,,940,5.390410958904109

BRAVISSIMO!  Effective simple set, and how daring to have a naked Neptune complete with exposed penis!
They list a director of choreography and gesture.  All the gestures were right-on.  Stupendous!  All the characters so compelling.  Ilia, Idamante, Idomeneo, Elettra.  Three cheers!  Hooray!",1473206400,,405,6.218181818181818
