7822492,5,6302227429,"In ""Child in the Night"" Elijah Wood plays Luke, an 8-year-old living in Seattle who witnesses the murder of his father. But the images are so traumatic that he represses the incident and closes out the world around him. The police have no clues to go on, so they turn to a psychologist (Jobeth Williams) to work with the boy to try to unlock the mystery that is hidden deep inside his mind. This movie is totally engaging as we watch Williams trying to break through the trauma that has paralyzed this young boy. She doesn't want to do anything that might scar him for life, but she knows that he is the only one who can identify his father's killer. Elijah Wood is simply adorable in his introductory role. I consider this a must-see movie for all Elijah Wood fans. When you watch this movie, you will understand why Elijah Wood went on to become one of the most successful movie actors in modern film history. I only wish this movie would get a DVD release. It certainly deserves it.",1307232000,,985,4.447513812154696

A young boy(played by Elijah Wood) holds the key to the murder of his father by seeing who did it but can't remember who it was. Only by the childrens' story of Peter Pan and Captain Hook (him being Peter Pan and the murderer as Captain Hook) is he to piece together with the help of a child psychologist(played by JoBeth Williams) the mystery of his father's murder. This movie also stars Darren McGavin (Kolchak,The Night Stalker)and Tom Skerritt(Picket Fences). Just a note of TV history for you. This isn't the only time Darren McGavin and Tom Skerritt acted together. If you recall back in 1974-75,Darren McGavin's series ""Kolchak,The Night Stalker"" episode: ""The Devil's Platform"" it starred Tom Skerritt as a politician who sold his soul to the devil to get wealth and fame and higher political offices and killed anyone who stood in his way of getting it. In that episode Tom Skerritt was the killer and Darren McGavin was the good guy and in this movie Tom Skerritt was the good guy and Darren McGavin was the killer.( I guess that only seems fair)",1049587200,15,1142,4.658415841584159
