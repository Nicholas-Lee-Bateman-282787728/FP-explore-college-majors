3052635,4,B0010V60YI,I wish I would have gotten the director's cut. It's cute. Great movie to watch with the girls. Happy I bought it.,1311724800,,113,4.181818181818182
3052636,3,B0010V60YI,"It's several different shows put together. I only watched the one with Kat and Nikki, they are on top on the cover.
They are very hot girls. The price is quite good if you get it used. The main question is, can you click on the one with Kat and Nikki and just see that. The answer is, yes you can!",1309564800,,297,3.8852459016393444
3052637,4,B0010V60YI,"Good movie...Not great,but good. More flesh of Mila would be better. That has to be one of the main reasons why people would buy this movie..need more Mila nudity.",1291680000,2,163,4.655172413793103
3052638,3,B0010V60YI,"If you are a Mila Kunis fan, you need to own this movie. She is hot hot hot!!! She has a room mate who can't stop going down on her! And who can blame her because Mila Kunis is the end all, beat all woman of our time. The only problem is that she is not in the movie for very long. In fact the whole movie is made up of short stories. Just when you start to get into a couple, it's over. You are left wanting more. Therefore, only three stars.",1282176000,3,443,3.774193548387097
3052639,3,B0010V60YI,"I bought this film only because Jane Seymour is in it. She has a minor part as a parent and it is clearly not one of her best endeavors. However Jane's alluring ""crooked' smile makes an appearance or two and that was enough for me! I fast forwarded through the rest of it!",1275177600,2,272,4.150943396226415
3052640,4,B0010V60YI,Interesting concept and good execution. The movie drug in a few places and I intended to give it a 3 star rating until the last scene between Jose Pablo Cantillo and Taryn Manning. That scene alone was worth four stars.,1235001600,2,219,4.5
3052641,4,B0010V60YI,This movie is a lot of fun.  Great performances and an unusual take on the subject.  Worth a look.,1216598400,3,98,4.105263157894737
3052642,2,B0010V60YI,"Collection of short stories! Flips to different ""couples"" giving you a glimpse into their conversations 'After Sex!' Great concept but it was executed very poorly! Not one of the ""couples"" was an actual ""couple! Spoiler** Two ""bi-curious couples,"" ""one illegal couple (cop & prostitute), and another ""couple that is cheating on their significant others..."" Like what?! Didn't make any sense!!
Did a great job of leaving the audience wanting to know more! Mainly because decisions and revelations were made but we didn't get to see a finished product!",1414540800,,550,5.261363636363637

3052646,5,B0010V60YI,I love Zoe Saldana and got this movie just to see her and the hotness that is Mila Kunis together. But besides that the movie was pretty good too.,1400371200,,146,4.068965517241379
3052647,5,B0010V60YI,"I have to say that I got this movie because I thought the premise was different. What a huge shock at how much I loved it. this is an all talk movie with nothing blowing up and no world conquering aliens. Sweet and thoughtful movie about 8 couples and what they talk about after having just had sex. the couples are all different, friends with benefits, experimentations, one night stands (kind of) . Sll kinds of couples, too, an elderly couple, 2 gay couples (kind of), 1 lesbian couple (kind of) 5 straight couples. The talks are eye opening and revealing and in some cases funny. Harsh language sometimes...esp from Mila Kunis, yes, Mila Kunis. Dave Franco is terrific and so cute too. All the couples were really terrific, my favs....Freddy and Jay (happy sad or sad happy) and Marco and Alanna, so funny, he is GREAT, Leslie and Chris. This lovely little film gets huge recommendations (my opinion). You will smile and laugh a little and maybe well up a bit.",1393200000,4,964,4.6104651162790695
3052648,5,B0010V60YI,This was a wonderful movie that I ordered. A movie like this is a fun one to watch and I'll buy more like this one.,1390003200,,115,3.64
3052649,1,B0010V60YI,This is a dumb movie the dumbest I have ever seen. not worth watching nor buying dumb story line and recorded in several different stories,1386201600,,138,4.56
3052650,5,B0010V60YI,"One of my favorite movies of all time. There are so many great, quotable lines from this film. I have seen it probably 24 times so far. This movie does a great job of highlighting important issues regarding sexuality that go unnoticed or ignored for whatever reason. I used this as a hall program several times because it helps foster so many good conversations.",1385078400,6,362,4.671875
3052651,3,B0010V60YI,"I thought this was an actual movie, but it's just clips of movies, but who doesn't love Mila Kunis & Zoe Saldana! Seller shipped fast, too!",1381708800,,139,4.384615384615385
3052652,2,B0010V60YI,"I saw some interesting clips of this movie online, so I decided to order it and see how it is. Whoever made the clips, literally chose the best two out of the whole movie. LOL. I love Mila Kunis, and I was hoping to see more of her in there, but instead I got a bunch of random scenes kinda mushed together and called a movie. I think the idea for the movie was good, but the was it was put together wasn't very clean cut or effective.",1381276800,,435,3.9545454545454546
3052653,1,B0010V60YI,What a waste of time and film.  How does crap like this make it to the market?  Don't waste your money.,1380672000,,103,3.857142857142857
3052654,1,B0010V60YI,This movie was not at all as good as i expected. I was disappointed and i will literally never watch it again willingly.,1379289600,,120,4.260869565217392
3052655,3,B0010V60YI,Fun little clips of couples. Some of them were weirder than others... overall it was okay. Better than I expected.,1377734400,2,114,4.75
3052656,5,B0010V60YI,It was very different and not like your average movie for sure... It was entertaining and interesting. Should've been another hour though.,1371772800,,138,5.318181818181818
3052657,4,B0010V60YI,"I was't quite sure what to expect with this movie. It has a good cast and I am a fan of the different scenario approach to story telling. This movie is worth a look if your a fan of romantic dramadies, like I said good cast and good stories. Check it out!",1370995200,4,255,3.923076923076923
3052658,4,B0010V60YI,"Before I watched the movie, I read the reviews on Amazon, which made me very wary. I really wasn't sure what to expect. I took a leap of faith and decided to rent it and I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the film. The conversations that were had were very easy to relate to, in my opinion. Yes, there were definitely some bad actors throughout the movie but overall, I thought it was well worth the $2.99 I rented it for.",1369180800,2,423,4.234567901234568
3052659,2,B0010V60YI,the product was cheap and it shipped fast but the movie was awful. I don't recommend it. Don't waste your money on this movie people.,1365552000,,133,4.36
3052660,3,B0010V60YI,Really thought there would be more Mila Kunis in this one. The move was very slow. I found myself skipping scenes just to get to the best parts of the movie which were the ones that mila was in.,1356480000,2,194,4.0
3052661,2,B0010V60YI,"In all fairness, I don't really know what I was expecting when I ordered this movie. I browsed through the DVDs, thought I found an interesting one, ordered it, and hoped for the best. The movie arrived in perfect condition. It was still enclosed in the plastic wrapper, there was no damage to the disc, and it arrived in the promised two days guaranteed by Amazon Prime. The movie itself, however, was a little bit of a disappointment.

Firstly, let me begin by stating that I'm a woman. I'm a woman who very much enjoys the cheesy romantic comedies that present the female species with unrealistic expectations of romance. Chick flicks are a must-have, as far as I'm concerned - and how much more ""chick-flicky"" can you get than a movie that seemingly focuses entirely on pillow talk?

Secondly, I'm a big fan of Mila Kunis, so it was mostly her role in the film that encouraged me to purchase it. On the up side, Kunis appears in the movie for about as long as everyone else in the film. The downside, however, is that nobody is in the film for very long.

Each couple presented an interesting story to the movie which, I believe, could each easily be made into separate plot lines, and therefore separate movies. The concept is that all eight of the couples featured in the movie are linked together by some sort of ""After Sex"" talk - and, in theory, it sounds intriguing. The frustrating part is that each couple has a story that could be explored in greater detail, with much more humor and more in-depth emotion than the time constraints for this movie allowed. So, without the background stories and insights into the characters, the theory put into practice turns into the viewer essentially taking tiny clips from what feels like eight lengthy movies, and trying to summarize them all in your head by relating them to back to the title of the film.

In short, it's okay. Nothing spectacular, and nothing horrible, either. It would have been better with a little more territory to explore with each couple. It's okay for background noise, or for something to watch while eating a quick meal, but definitely not a movie to sit down and watch with friends if you're looking for a laugh.",1341532800,3,2193,4.629820051413882
