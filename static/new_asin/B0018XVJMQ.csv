3421441,5,B0018XVJMQ,"LA VENTANA (THE WINDOW) is a gentle masterpiece of cinema written and directed by Carlos Carlos Sorn . It is about living and dying and how, hopefully, we all can approach that last day on earth.  Filmed in Argentina's Patagonia by cinematographer Julian Apezteguia with an emphasis on sunshine and landscape this little film humbly presents the final day of living of  80-year-old writer Antonio (Antonio Larreta) who has been confined to bed in his home after a heart attack  (his warmly caring doctor advises him to be hospitalized, but Antonio seems to appreciate the futility of that move).  He is attended by two women - Mar&iacute;a del Carmen (Mar&iacute;a del Carmen Jim&eacute;nez) and Emilse (Emilse Rold&aacute;n) - who prepare his meals and his medications and cut his hair and keep his old home clean.  Antonio is frisky and more than anything wants to walk in his vegetable garden he watches through his bedside window.  He calls upon a piano tuner to tune his ancient piano in preparation for the visit of his son Pablo (Jorge D&iacute;ez), a famous concert pianist, who is due to arrive with his girlfriend Claudia (Carla Peterson) after a very long absence.  Antonio finally decides to take a walk in his garden and his land, longing to once again feel a part of nature.  He stumbles, is unable to get up, and is found by neighbors who bring him home. After seeing his son, and after recalling a repeated dream of the lovely woman who served as his nanny, Antonio simply goes to sleep, happy and serene.

There is no story to this beautiful film, Instead it is just a day in the life of a man who has lived a good life and accepts his dying with great dignity and happiness.  Each of the actors in this elegy is perfect for the simple roles.  But it is the performance by Antonio Larreta under Carlos Carlos Sorn's direction that makes this film soar, quietly and with profound respect for the art of living and of dying.  It is a little masterpiece.  Grady Harp, January 10",1262649600,2,1992,4.6571428571428575
3421442,4,B0018XVJMQ,"The Window is a Noirish take on The Boy Who Cried Wolf, supurbly acted by a terrific cast.  It's also a great document of the urban decay that took place in America's cities during the Depression and World War II immediately before widespread suburbanization.  It's simply inexcusable that this stunning film isn't currently available on DVD in the US.",1259539200,4,352,4.9491525423728815
3421443,5,B0018XVJMQ,"(special thanks to Film Movement for providing me with an advance copy of this movie!)

Tomo (Thomas Turgoose) is a boy from Notingham, running away from unspecified problems at home. Marek (Piotr Jagiello) is a Polish boy, now living in London. The two boys meet and become friends, bonding together through their infautation with a beautiful French woman.

That's the basic synopsis of the film. Pretty simple, nothing special. Ah, but then you see the movie!

I found a lot of pleasant surprises in the film. Marek's father, for example, is a hard-working immigrant man and, almost astonishingly for modern fiction, it NOT abusive towards his son! In fact the two seem to have a fairly healthy relationship, and, while it's not a perfect one, it is one of the more realistic father/son relationships I've seen on film.

Also, there's Tomo, a rather unlikable boy at first, who everytime someone gives him something out of the goodness of their hearts, has the attitude of, ""What, is that all?"" Making him rather an unpleasant little oik, and one of the two main characters, took guts, and it pays off. Perhaps this is due to the balance provided by Marek, an all-around charming, friendly boy.

The movie is a little shorter than some might like, but it packs a lot of story into 70 minutes. There's great performances and nice, if subtle, cinematogprahy. It's the first one I've seen from Film Movement, and it encourages me to get more!

Also included on the disc is the 10 minute short, ""Odd Shoe"", about a very strange looking boy, his infatuation for a girl, and a pair of shoes. It's a surprisingly effective little movie and well-worth watching.",1258848000,,1655,4.809859154929577
3421444,5,B0018XVJMQ,"Some excellent teen dramas coming out of the UK lately, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boy-A/dp/B001CDFY6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boy A</a>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summer-Scars/dp/B001C0JROC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summer Scars</a>&nbsp;for others (not my favorite) and now this black & white version of life in Somers Town.

A solid performance film by both kids and the believability appears spot-on for a working class movie. All of the words plastered into the cover art ring true; heartwarming, witty, charming, etc. None of the sets ever feel made up and the locations all look authentic. The color palette ending had just the right appeal for a completion on this kind of story. The supplements are a standard set for the Film Movement releases, including the interviews, text screen backgrounds on location history and a great short film.

The short is titled Odd Shoe by Paul Cotter. Awesome little performance for this poor kid who happens upon a nice pair of shoes, but not without some serious heartache. Lasts 10 minutes and is worth the watch. The main feature is a short 68 minutes (70 with credits) but is appropriate for the story.

Four for the film, one for the extras and short film. Enjoy.",1254700800,,1331,5.958115183246074
3421445,5,B0018XVJMQ,"Somers Town (2008) is fresh and lighthearted coming of age story that has real-life charm and drama. It is serious yet fun look at growing up. The people you meet and the situations you get into, as well as your dreams, truly shape who you are. Being filmed in black and white gives it a clean feel that enables you to focus on the events and characters without distraction. The original music by Gaven Clark is refreshing and perfectly fits the style of the film.

Tomo (Thomas Turgoose) has just arrived by train in the Somers Town area of London after leaving his hometown of Nottingham. He is an extremely open and chatty young man that befriends a lady, Jane, on the train. Meanwhile, Marek (Piotr Jagiello) is walking with his dad (Ireneusz Czop) to his job where he is working on a new track for the train. Marek goes off on the town taking photographs along the way. That evening Marek and his dad head home for some diner that Marek cooks up in their cramped kitchen. They enjoy each others company and have fun and open chats about life while learning the English language. They moved from Poland looking for a new start after his marriage failed. The shy and reserved Marek takes to the streets again to photograph at night after his father goes out for a nightcap.

Tomo is out on the streets trying to get someone to buy him some beer. With only an army style duffel bag and the clothes on his back he is in for a rough road to make a life in London. When he is relaxing some local kids come upon him and start slightly pestering him for a drink and start bothering him a little - after they finish his beer he attempts to get away. They catch up to him in the ally and beat him up really bad and take all of his things. With no money or clothes and nowhere to turn he looks up Jane (Kate Dickie) from the train. She buys him lunch and gives him a little cash to get the train back home to where he ran away from.

Tomo spots Marek looking and some pictures in the restaurant. He is taken back by the beauty of the women in the photographs, as is Marek. Marie is from Paris and works as a local lunch spot. The two quickly become friends and start what will become a very memorable summer of their younger years. They meet Graham, who is an odd neighbor that recruits the boys to help him with a little venture of his and offers life guidance. Without his dad's knowledge Marek has Tomo staying in his room with him. They spend their days pining for Maria and just being teenagers in London.

9 out of 10 - I really liked this movie. The true to life and sometimes crass script is flawlessly acted by the cast. It has a soothing quality and the moments of difficulty offset by funny situations bring this film together so well. I wish the movie never ended; I even watch it again a couple days later and enjoyed it even more. Shane Meadows directed this amazing movie. This is a wonderful film for just about everyone to watch - be sure to pick up this independent film when it comes out on DVD in December.

3421446,4,B0018XVJMQ,"This sixty year old film may be viewed as tame today, but for its time, The Window (1949) is a simple and effective little thriller.  Running just 73 minutes, there is hardly a wasted moment.  Nine year old Tommy Woodry (Bobby Driscoll) lives in a New York City apartment with his mother (Barbara Hale) and father (Arthur Kennedy).  One evening, while on the fire escape, he witnesses a murder while looking through the window of the apartment one floor above.  With robbery as the apparent motive, the Kellerson's (husband and wife), shoved a pair of scissors into a sailor.

Tommy has a reputation for exaggeration, and his parents don't believe him when he tells them what he has seen.  He reports the crime to the police, but the Kellerson's don't arouse their suspicions.  When the homicidal pair become aware that Tommy may have seen something, they abduct the boy when he is left alone at home.  Fortunately Tommy is a resourceful lad, and manages to escape several times.  The climax is a thrilling cat and mouse chase on the stairs of a condemned building, with Paul Stewart giving a good performance, as the menacing Joe Kellerson.

Largely due to his performance in this film, Bobby Driscoll won a special Academy Award as the 'outstanding juvenile actor' of 1949.  He is one of only twelve to win this award.  Driscoll would later star as Jim Hawkins in Disney's Treasure Island (1950), and in perhaps his most famous role, he would provide the voice for Peter Pan, in Disney's 1953 animated feature.  Unfortunately, Driscoll ran into problems with drugs and the law, and died under unusual circumstances in 1968, at the age of 31.  The Window is not presently available on Region 1 DVD, but you may be able to catch it sometime on TCM.",1251849600,4,1748,4.726072607260726
3421447,5,B0018XVJMQ,"""The Window"" proves the universal appeal of well-made movies. Carlos Sorn's story is set in Patagonia, yet the rolling ranch on which the aging patriarch lives could be a setting out of a Western in the American Plains. As Antonio, the patriarch, prepares for the return of his beloved son, this could be a character envisioned by Hemingway or Faulkner or John Ford.

What turns this into great cinema is that Sorn paints his story with his camera. There's a 10-minute segment in which the old man, who has been bedridden for a long time, suddenly feels such inspiration that he decides to walk through his gardens and fields once again. It's an almost wordless sequence, yet you won't move a muscle as it unfolds.

Watch how tantalizing memories and stories emerge as the big house is cleaned for the son's visit. And, toward the end of the film, watch how the father's vision paints scenes in the house--and how the son's vision paints similar scenes.

While the film may sound simple and the story may sound somber, you'll find a whole lot to discuss after it ends-exploring how the scenes from various perspectives merge and separate spiritually. ""The Window"" elevates the whole reflection on aging to a different, deeper level-pointing toward gifts within this universal journey.",1250899200,10,1284,4.907834101382488
3421448,5,B0018XVJMQ,"I was waiting for there to be a solid film like this showing the subtle ends to a distinguished life. A minimalist film all the way, right down to there being little to no dialogue for ten minutes at a time. The background sounds relayed some of the scenes eloquently, including the constant piano tuning, nature sounds, a grandfather clock and more.

We get to watch a heart attack survivor live out his recovery time at a beautiful country estate (filmed in the Patagonia region I believe). His restless wit is offset by the overbearing nursing staff, ambiguous family and beautiful solitude. Well filmed and very reminiscent of how I see things for me when those days arrive.

As usual for Film Movement, the DVD includes an excellent and relevant short film about similar emotions, some great previews and other company related materials. Subtle, yet beautiful, hope you enjoy it.",1245369600,17,884,4.886666666666667

3421541,4,B0018XVJMQ,"I'd been wanting to see this film for 4 or 5 years, when I finally got the DVD as a gift this past Christmas. It was well worth the wait.

Directed by Shane Meadows, and written by his 'Twenty-Four Seven' and 'A Room For Romeo Brass' collaborator Paul Fraser, 'Somers Town' is a gently humorous tale of two teenage boys in London -- Marek (Piotr Jagiello), a bored and lonely Polish immigrant, and Tomo (Thomas Turgoose, star of Meadows' 'This Is England'), a homeless runaway from Nottingham -- who become friends one summer. Their adventures include trying to keep Tomo's presence a secret from Marek's dad, finding more clothes for Tomo, and crushing on a pretty French waitress.

Meadows has dealt with coming-of-age themes before, in films that were more darkly hilarious (ARFRB) and more powerful (the semi-autobiographical TIE); but while ST is fairly slight (at a scant 70 minutes) by comparison, his naturalistic approach and the easygoing chemistry between Jagiello and Turgoose make this little film a charming romp in its own right.

Note: Unrated, but a light PG-13 equivalent for brief profanity.",1391212800,,1110,5.021739130434782

It felt as if the script was a schoolboy's homework and he was s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g it to make it fit the assignment. And as much as I hate to sound like a killjoy, I just wasn't convinced that these two boys would have become such good friends in the real world. I also would have liked a better explanation of why Tomo struck out for London on his own in the first place. It all just felt very thin to me. The acting was solid and the touch of Shane Meadows is evident, but there just wasn't enough meat on the bones to satisfy.",1366761600,,601,4.189655172413793
3421544,4,B0018XVJMQ,"""The Window"" (2008 release from Argentina; 80 min.) brings the story of an 80 yr. old man (played by Antonio Larreta) who lives on a large estate somewhere in remote Argentina. His health is failing him, but he is excited as his long-estranged son, now a successful piano concertist based in Europe, is coming home to visit him. To tell you much more of the already very simple plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this is a gorgous ""little movie"", basically a painting in motion. Check out at the opening when the house of the old man first comes into focus: inititally it's hard to distinguish, then it looks grayish and foggy, but then eventually it fully reveals itself in bright yellow and red. This type of scene is repeated time and again in the movie: the camera is stationed and the scene reveals itself slowly but surely. Antonio Larreta is magnificent as the old man staring into his own mortality. Without giving any further spoilers, I felt that the arrival of the old man's son comes too little, too late into the movie, as by then the full picture really had been revelead and the visit almost becomes irrelevant, or at best an afterthought.

That aside, this is a beautifully crafted and understated movie that will reward anyone not in a hurry. I should also mention that I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of indie and foreign movies (I finally gave in last year and started my subscription of the DVD of the Month series). ""The Window"" is another winning entry in the rich Film Movement catalog. Bottom line, this is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, but if you are in the mood for a qaulity foreign movie, ""The Window"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1357516800,,1764,4.614649681528663

I always do something with my hands while watching TV, such as needlepoint or knitting, so I don't like movies that require my eyes on the screen at all times. This movie does have some sub-titles especially in the beginning, and you have to pay attention to them or lose the storyline.

Worse than that, I found the English boy's accent very difficult to understand. The Polish boy was easier to understand, but his speech was very soft. On top of language issues and volume problems, I wasn't endeared to the story. Period. The only aspect I didn't have a problem with was the B&W vs color.

I enjoy the Film Movement concept, and this is another small, low-budget movie worth a view for fans of this sort of coming of age flick. The two leads are solid, the film shot in pleasingly grainy black and white until near the end, and it's a  sleek 70 minutes. The story and locale are both pretty bleak, featuring council block flats and that sort of Dickensian feel that London delivers so well. But there are rays of light, not only in the central friendship but, somewhat uniquely, in the single father and his son's connection, which is both realistic and free from the standard tropes. No beatings or abuse, just two guys trying to understand each other with respect. Very nice.

Some decent humor, plenty of quiet irony, and an oddly pleasant dour feel make this worth watching for fans of smaller, mellow character studies.",1263254400,,845,4.695945945945946

________________________

Don Antonio is an aging writer recovering from a bad heart.  He's in bed with an IV drip and tended to by two women, Maricarmen and Elise.  Both coddle him.

The film begins with Don Antonio's boyhood dream of a pretty woman staring at him, a woman his mother introduces as his babysitter.  But he can't remember her name.  In fact, the entire movie is about Don Antonio trying to remember, and the viewer is wondering what it is in his life that he wants to remember.  He forgets where he places his money.  He had hidden money inside his books but the money is no longer there.  Is someone in the home taking it without his knowledge?

Don Antonio's son is coming from Europe.  He is an accomplished pianist.  Downstairs in the house is an old German piano that Don Antonio is having retuned so that his son can play it.  A piano tuner busies himself getting the piano ready, the two women are getting the room prepared for the son's visit, and the doctor comes by to tell him he needs to stay in bed and rest his heart, but Antonio longs to walk his land, look out at the horses, and take in the prairie winds.  The walk weakens him, but luckily two women riding their bikes nearby see him and get help.

Most of the film is about Antonio getting ready for his son's visit.  The pace is very slow, and one is never sure why father and son drifted apart.  When the son arrives, along with a female guest no one was expecting, it's still not sure what happened between father and son.  The son alternates between ""Papa"" and ""Viejo"" (Old Man) when talking to his father.

Time and age are the theme here.  The women coddle Antonio, but the men (besides the doctor) in the house seem to encourage him to move around and be part of the landscape.  Antonio doesn't want to be treated like a useless old man but plays along when he realizes he's not as strong as he once was.  The wall clock ticks during important scenes and a small part of the meadow outside is visible from the window, symbolizing a small part of life in the man's existence.

I enjoyed the pastoral scenes and the various characters in the film, but the ending is confusing.  I never learned what happened between father and son.",1523232000,,2396,4.415525114155251

The quiet, insistent ticking of a clock in the hallway and the swish of the swinging pendulum echo almost subliminally through the house and reverberate in the lives of the people with a strength that belies the subtle sounds  but Don Antonio is acutely aware of Times presence in his life, looming larger with the passing of each minute. The film opens with a dream  Don Antonio sees visions from his youth 80 years before, of his mother introducing him to his babysitter for the evening. He can almost see the young womans face  a tantalizing memory made more poignant by his inability to bring it completely into focus. He can hear music in the house  his assumption is that his parents were entertaining at home.

Reality asserts itself when he awakens and is troubled that he cannot remember the babysitters face  he wonders where he lost the memory, how it slipped away from him. Don Antonio is bedridden, apparently recovering from some unspecified heart-related problem, in San Juan, his ancestral home, remotely situated on the pampas of Argentina. He is under the care  and watchful eyes  of Maria del Carmen and Emilse, who function as housekeepers, cooks and caregivers, along with a longtime handyman. Their lives are pursued with little contact from the outside world  the occasional visit from a deliveryman or repairman, and of course regular visits from Don Antonios doctor and friend. They have no telephone, depending on a two-way radio for communication.

The film takes place over the course of a single day  a special day, with the impending visit of Don Antonios estranged son Pablo, who is a famous concert pianist now living in Europe. His return after many years is an opportunity for reconciliation with his father, and Don Antonio is determined that his son will be made welcome, and that the occasion will be celebrated as it should. Maria del Carmen and Emilse are pressed into readying a room for Don Pablo, as well as making sure that San Juans piano is properly tuned. Don Antonios doctor pays a call to examine his patient and check on the progress of his recuperation. He gently refuses Don Antonios request that he be allowed to receive his son outside of his bed, telling him that the time is not yet right for him to be more mobile. The nature of his long friendship with Don Antonio is illustrated by his calming assurance that the two of them will go fishing together when the old mans health is better  but the look in Don Antonios eyes reveals that he knows more about his own condition than those around him might think.

The tall window in Don Antonios bedroom looks out onto his land  a panoramic view of the wind-swept fields under the beautiful canopy of the Argentine sky. He longs to walk his property again, to pace through the fields, to see the condition of his beloved garden  but Maria del Carmen and Emilse keep him on a short leash, concerned about his health and the doctors orders. The IV constantly in his arm acts as a tether  he can move about the room from time to time, when his bed is being made, or when he sits in a chair to have his hair trimmed, but its easy to see that it feels more like a ball and chain to him. The aching in his eyes and on his face as he gazes out of his window is palpable.

Don Antonio is a writer  one of the few modern conveniences visible in the film is his laptop computer, on which he works sporadically. During the doctors visit, he asks the physician to retrieve a book from the shelf  a first edition of A UNIVERSAL HISTORY OF INFAMY by legendary Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. As he brings the book to Don Antonio, the doctor notices that the book is signed by Borges, with a dedication to Don Antonio, making it a very special item indeed  and he is all the more astonished when the old man insists that the doctor take the book as a gift from him. Its a touching moment  Don Antonio conveys, through this selfless gesture, the value he places upon their friendship, at the same time letting the doctor know that the patient is aware that his time might not be long.

After a brief escape for a walk around his property leaves him in a weakened state, tempering his hopes for a proper celebration around the return of his son. Don Pablo arrives not alone, but in the company of a woman named Claudia, apparently his girlfriend  she is evidently a performer herself, and is only partially present, concerned about the lack of communication with the outside world interfering with an upcoming booking. She greets Don Antonio with a combination of petulance and detached respect that clearly show she would rather be back in the real world instead of stranded in the middle of nowhere. Antonio insists on having a bottle of champagne brought up from the cellar for a ceremonial toast  his son notes that the handwriting on the label is that of his mother, which his father acknowledges wistfully. As the bottle is uncorked, the lack of the characteristic pop tells everyone that it is flat  another instance in which Time makes its presence and effects noticed. Afterwards, alone, the son explores the house, unfamiliar to him after the ensuing years. He approaches the piano, finding two tin soldiers on the top. They were retrieved earlier from inside, wedged among the mechanism, by the piano tuner, where they had evidently fallen many years ago, when Pablo was a child. He pockets them  a quiet, perhaps unconscious attempt to capture Time.

The film is shot beautifully  there are long scenes with little dialogue, but volumes are spoken, nevertheless, by the eyes and facial expressions of the characters, as well as by the movement of the natural world, which of course has a life of its own. There is tangible poetry in the cinematography, and a completely unpretentious grace in the characters  something that cannot be taught, which must have its source deep within. The actors embody their roles, immersing themselves in them, becoming the characters they portray  its an essential element too often missing in modern filmmaking, and refreshing to see in such quantity and quality as in this film. Sorins script is neither heavy-handed nor nave, dealing gently and openly with mortality and memory, two elements of our existence that are completely under the sometimes cruel thumb of Time. There is a sort of informed sentimentality present  it is never maudlin or simplistic, gifted to the viewer by the director and cast as an undeniable element of life. We are born, we live, and we die  what we experience over the course of a life molds us and shapes us according to our own sensibilities, directed and nudged by the events through which we pass. Don Antonios ghostly dream from his boyhood attains a clarity he never imagined it would reach, delivered by a messenger completely unexpected  it is all the more of a treasure for this, just as this film is a moving cinematic treasure for the viewer. It is touching without being manipulative, filled with beauty that is completely free from artifice, visual poetry that moves and flows with the natural rhythm of the wind through the grass.

P.S. -- I'm not sure how Amazon's descriptions got so mixed up -- 2/3 of the reviews obviously refer to a different film.  My review is for the DVD pictured above.",1468540800,3,7373,4.680340557275541
