8333930,5,B001PNTPNE,I highly recommend this DVD as it has a great message and is very well done by other high schoolers.  The music is fun and filled with great routines.  Anyone who enjoys musicals this one is for you.,1369267200,,199,4.2105263157894735
8333931,5,B001PNTPNE,"I first saw this video back when it was first released, in the 80's. Yes, now it is dated, especially the clothing and hair styles. But, I showed this video to this year's seniors and juniors, and when we did not have time to finish it in one period, the next day they insisted that we watch the rest of it, to see what happens. I thought they would be totally ""turned off"" by the styles and the music, but they loved it. And for us, since we are a small, private, Christian school, the message was very good, and still is timely. In fact, our drama teacher has been asked repeatedly over the years to produce this musical for our school. I don't know if we will, but it would be a challenge, even though it is from the 80's.",1339545600,3,725,4.148936170212766

We didn't have a VCR when I was little, so mom made a tape recording of the video so we could listen to the recording.  We had it memorized.  It still brings a smile to my face today.",1313020800,,276,3.789473684210526
8333933,5,B001PNTPNE,I first saw this as a child and I lost the movie. I have to say I love it as much today as I did then!!! This Christian movie teaches us about how to best deal with the hard times in our lives along with good.,1299369600,2,209,3.5652173913043477
