6284276,4,B00IORPRCC,"A weird noir type film, this was a mix of noir thriller, icky bug and revenge flick. It also had LOTS of nudity, thanks to the main character Callum Blue and two women Ashlynn Yennie and Nicole Liberte. They held nothing back, except the money shots. That being said, I guess you could say it was part of the plot.

The actual story has already been hashed out by other reviewers so I won't go into it here. I followed along, trying to figure out what was going on. It was only halfway through when I had an idea of what was the heros secret. Then the rest of it was seeing what hed do about it.

The violence, just like the nudity was over the top, which I guess was par for an indie flick. It didn't move me either way. I think it was plenty gratuitous, but what can I say? Ive seen worse. What it all boils down to is that the movie played out well. The ending worked and in the end, it finished leaving me with enough sense of completion that I wasn't upset or wanted to throw it in the trash. Fractured got from point A to B, maybe a bit rough around the edges and a bit exploitatively, but nonetheless, it completed the story with a decent finish. It was a mix of genres that made it at least stand above the crowd a bit. Not bad at all, despite its flaws.",1414886400,2,1262,4.06425702811245

6284279,4,B00IORPRCC,"The film opens up by asking a question, Can a really bad person becomes a really good person and vice versa? This sets up the theme of the film as we examine the life of amnesia victim Dylan White (Callum Blue) to a Louisiana jazz soundtrack. Fractured refers to Dylan's memory, skull, and life as he was left for dead. Without a memory he attempts to find out who he was from brief memory pieces.

What hampers Dylan on his quests is that he has these strange nightmares as if he crosses over or is haunted. The first episode happens 8 minutes into the film. The clues come at us and about half way through the film, we get a pretty good idea what is going on with a few missing details to keep us interested. Vinnie Jones is the antagonist who comes later into the film.

The film  expands on older concepts, employing a somewhat noir background as opposed to a horror setting. The horror is sparse and was more mystery than terrifying. A different type of film. 3 1/2 stars

8644218,3,B00IORPRCC,"Fractured is one of those movies that's just good enough to get the job done, but you certainly don't want to watch it again.  Even recommending it to someone makes you hesitate because you really don't want to. With that said I liked it, but on a small scale.

It begins showing a man named Dylan who's at home.  Suddenly this attractive woman walks through the front door.  She starts hitting on him and they end up in the bedroom going at each other.  Wow I wish mysterious hot women showed up at my door more often, haha!  She says she can't be Dylan's girlfriend because she's one of those girls.  She's not wholesome but she's not sleazy.  She's in between.  She's also quite ditzy and won't be able to help Dylan with his troubles.

When Dylan uses the bathroom and returns, he suddenly finds himself in a hospital hallway with an evil woman chasing after him.  He can't get through the hospital door to escape!  Ah, it was just a hallucination.  Shortly after he and his on again/off again girlfriend head to a convenience store.  I swear she looks pregnant while walking down one of the aisles.  When Dylan reaches for something in the frozen section he's suddenly pulled inside and finds himself in a dark room surrounded by naked women covered in blood and grabbing his ankles.  A naked woman walks up to him and he snaps out of it.  These are two strange hallucinations!  I guess they're hallucinations, even though later he really is transported to different strange areas.  He has more hallucinations when he exits a bar, a bus drives by and nearly hits him.  He then finds himself in a dark room with a pregnant woman.  These hallucinations *do* mean something eventually.  It takes a while to get to the meaning behind them though.

For now though, Dylan visits a doctor and he runs some tests.  He thinks amnesia or sleepwalking might be responsible for Dylan's hallucinations.  The doctor wants to run more tests but Dylan's in a hurry to get out of there.  Dylan and his ""girlfriend"" arrive to a place where he had a car accident.  After this Dylan travels somewhere on his own to figure out what's going on with these constant nagging hallucinations.  He remains away from home the rest of the movie.  On the way he stops at a bar and meets a hot red-headed lady with snake tattoos named Marlena.  The two get to know each other better and eventually find themselves going at it in Dylan's hotel room.  They even... Marlena does something gross with her finger.  Ewwww!  And Dylan likes it!

I guess since he's not technically the boyfriend of the other woman who drops by whenever she wants to have sex with him, it's okay to cheat on her with an equally hot lady!  Of course when she calls to check up on Dylan's progress he doesn't dare say he's cheating on her.  No way!  He feels guilty.  You can tell.  Anyway Marlena and Dylan appear to be headed towards having a relationship together since Marlena drops by his hotel room with alcohol and smokes.

Another story going on is that there's a dangerous criminal named Quincy.  He kidnapped a bunch of women, kept them trapped in a shed for days and took them to some kind of strip club-like back room where they had to stay for sexual favors.  Dylan bumps into this man and it turns out they have a history.  It's not a pleasant one either.  At first the movie teases it might be pleasant given Quincy's happy demeanor to see Dylan again.  When Quincy invites Dylan upstairs to catch up on old times, suddenly Quincy snaps and bangs Dylan's head into the table.  He brings in Marlena and does something horrific- he literally cuts her scalp open and rips her hair off.  Dylan is terrified.  But luckily for Dylan this isn't real!  It's not necessarily a hallucination though.  Somewhere in between.

After this Dylan finds himself in a room with a doppelganger of himself sitting on a couch behind a mirror.  His doppelganger explains that Dylan never woke up from his coma correctly so he's caught somewhere in a half asleep/half awake state which is why he keeps having these hallucinations.  Marlena walks in the room... the doppelganger's room that is, and sits on the couch next to him with her one breast hanging out.  Her scalp is fine.  SPOILERS!  It turns out Dylan used to be part of Quincy's criminal activity involving kidnapping all those girls.  He disagreed with Quincy's decision to kill them all in exchange for lots of money, so Quincy walks around shooting each and every girl.  Dylan feels guilty that he sinned for allowing this to happen, hence his visit to the church where a priest says that true repentance comes from acceptance and knowledge of not wanting anything in return.  Dylan questions this.  ""Doesn't everyone want something in return?""  But the priest says some want enlightenment while others want to embrace the holy spirit.

I don't think the movie ever explains why Dylan was in that coma.  Maybe it was related to the accident scene we see Dylan visit early on, or perhaps he was shot.  He wasn't supposed to wake up according to his doppelganger though.  All Dylan wanted was a boring regular life.  He didn't want to be associated with violence.  The movie relies heavily on jump scares such as when Dylan's pulled through the convenience store freezer doors, or when that pregnant woman jumps in his face or when he's almost hit by that bus (this one was SUPER loud!)  And of course when Quincy shoots all those women (by the way this scene is really graphic!)

I recommend Fractured but it's definitely weak in the storytelling.  3 stars is about right for this one.",1500422400,,5586,4.6181262729124235

8644226,2,B00IORPRCC,"Got through 27 minutes of stuttering, stammering, sputtering streaming (technical issue on Amazon's end) and said heck with it. The concept is interesting the lead is compelling but A) someone didn't pay the light bill B) A little too much of Mr. Producer playing out his sexual fantasies vicariously through film C) A great idea clearly begins to suffer cliche' and machismo. More balance, better cinematography, and a tweak more imagination would have made this worth suffering through. I get the sense that a great writer got hosed by a mediocre screenplay... which is always frustrating.

If you need something to fall asleep to... well... there you go.",1432771200,,657,5.083333333333333
