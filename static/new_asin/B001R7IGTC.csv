8337518,5,B001R7IGTC,"While I have gone through quite a few different Anime movies and series I usually turn around and sell off the sets once I am done to buy the next one.  Not for this set.  It is one that I will keep in my permanent collection.  I've watched this a couple times and plan on seeing is many more.  The story is excellent and the animation is amazing!  From previous reviews I thought it would be good but I was completely blown away when I finally watched it.  I even went out to get some of the noddles to eat the next time I watched it.

This is a keeper!",1390348800,,554,3.981818181818182
8337519,4,B001R7IGTC,"Con: It has some typical anime goofiness to it.  (More than I would have preferred.  Although it was kinda funny.)
Con: Some of the storyline stretched my credulity.  (But I have a LOT of science training, so I'm probably in the minority.)
Pro: Definitely a fun story.
Pro: Well drawn.
Pro: Some interesting philophical ideas are raised, without getting boring.
4/5 because I felt it needed to be several episodes longer.  (Or they could have cut some silliness and backfilled with meat.)",1389052800,,488,4.914634146341464
8337520,5,B001R7IGTC,"Ok... I came into this via a strange route.
I am learning computer animation and am using a program called Lightwave.
People who can really use it provide the special effects for many TV shows and movies so I was familiar with Lightwave's ""traditional"" uses.

But never did I think about it's use for Anime
I mean, Anime is all traditional hand drawn cell animation - Right?

But almost all of this show (7 episodes for the complete story) was done in CG that was ""cell shaded"" to look like regular anime.  I found myself lost in watching, because they make the transition so seamless.

The story in interesting enough to keep me watch... as well as being a teaching aid for me.
An enjoyable incentive to keep me learning.",1360281600,2,722,4.530769230769231
8337521,5,B001R7IGTC,"After a space station fell to Earth, the inhabitants of the Moon abandoned hope of ever returning. The city of Eden is the last home for humanity. People live peaceful yet controlled lives. One day, Takeru and his friends discover a picture and message from a beautiful girl. It says that Earth is well. Takeru falls in love with the girl he has never met, hijacks a space ship and sets off to Earth in search of the girl in the picture.

This anime took me by surprise. It has action, comedy, drama, and romance. The characters are likable, and the story is original and fantastic. My only complaint is the animation. The animation is very good; I just dislike the style. It's very different. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. the voice acting, and soundtrack are also quite well done. I think that this is something that everyone can enjoy. I strongly recommend it.",1358553600,3,873,4.525316455696203
8337522,5,B001R7IGTC,"What a fantastic piece of anime this is.  My only complaint was that it's too short!

Visually stunning right from the start with what I honestly think is the best intro I've ever seen.  And Utada Hikaru's ""This Is Love"" couples perfectly with the imagery.

It's very easy to empathize with the main players and that really is what separates the good anime from the great anime.  You've got three boys coming into their own on a search for something greater.  The plot is rather truncated because it's only 7 episodes, but that wasn't worth deducting a star for because it still manages to tell a complete story.  It's a shame though because there's enough material there for 30+ episodes.",1330905600,,689,4.691666666666666
8337523,5,B001R7IGTC,"very short because I do not write well in English
this is one of the best pieces of anime ever, and definitely a future classic.
without Any doubt i recommend this anime to any audience, from children, to the most demanding anime fan.

thanks for reading.",1320019200,3,255,4.543478260869565
8337524,5,B001R7IGTC,"Wow. i normally hate CGI anime but this show was amazing. It had a great story and some good action scenes. It was very retro. It felt like an anime made in the 80s (in a good way). This has easily become one of my favorite shows of all time. And the english dub was AMAZING. thats right, AMAZING!! I normally hate english dubs. I never watch anime in english but i put this dvd in and it was already set on english (like all anime) but i never switched it to japanese since the dub was so well done. I highly recommend. It is worth every penny",1314403200,,544,4.046296296296297
8337525,4,B001R7IGTC,"Freedom suffers from the same afflictions that so many ""Good, not Great"" anime suffer from; the visuals are execllent, the story is interesting, but the ending is weak. Freedom is one of the best looking anime I have seen in a very long time, the vehicle, character, and background designs are fantastic.  The animation is smooth and natural; the racing scenes are fantastic. The first few episodes are interesting and intriguing, you want to keep watching.  However as the story continues it begins to falter, things happen too quickly and easily, and then the story ends.  I still recommend Freedom, it looks great and there are many fine points to the story, but I wish the ending was stronger.",1287360000,12,697,4.840336134453781
8337526,5,B001R7IGTC,"Got this on the recommendation of Dave Halverson of Play Magazine.  He was right.  This series was GREAT!  Familiar story of a society isolated, but doing fine, on the moon after Earth became a wasteland.

The story, while it seems familiar in a good vs evil or small rebellion uprising sort of way, is actually deep and rich.  The animation is great.  The ideas and circumstances are original and not too far ""out there"".  Great sense of humor on the part of the writers or director or project lead - whoever it was -; there is some good funny stuff and great character development with which to inject humor.

There are no ""magic"" powers or super-hero people that can fly in this series. I've seen a few other Japimation series and I just can't get into Geass or ancient stones. This series is more believable to me as it seems to follow human nature and technological hurdles in a logical manner.

Episode 1 introduces us to the characters and life within the city on the moon, ""Eden"".  It ends with a our main character finding a photo on the surface of the moon.  That's all it took really.  From there I was hooked.  Who was the girl in the photo?  Why was it there?

Episode 2 investigates more into possible sources of the photo and gives a better look into how this moon society is is managed by the people in charge and how people go about there day to day lives in such a society.

Episode 3 got me out of my chair and yelling ""Yes!  Go! Go! Go!"".  By now the viewer knows the characters and should be immersed into the story and this is where the story ""takes off""!

I can not say more without giving too much away.  It is a must own for adults into anime, sci-fi, action, adventure, honor and friendship.  It's a MUST OWN for people like me into all of these things.

There are seven 30-minute episodes in all.  The last episode wraps things up nicely but I felt that it also left room to continue the story.

The good voice acting will be in Japanese so it may be better to read the sub-titles.  English is also available but the voice acting is usually dry, and IMHO, rather silly sounding, (why are female voices almost always a sappy little girl voice in the English dub?).  This is true of many Japanese animation dubbed to English for the USA.

There are a couple of slightly awkward moments in the series that might be considered adult themed by extremists but I believe this is safe for children, (no blood, no nudity, no guns). The action and dialogue can happen fast so it might be difficult for children, (okay, and adults), to keep up with the story.",1235779200,23,2575,4.3890063424947146
