8683410,5,B00OG16SNM,"Really enjoyed this.  I did not do the warm up or cool down because of lack of time but the other segments were great and actually worked up a sweat.  The music was not much (especially compared to zumba) but the moves were fun and not too complicated.
Salsa is the shortest segment but also the most fun for me.  Samba and Cha Cha are next (each about 15 minutes) and then tango is at the end (9 minutes-my least favorite segment). Give it a try!",1446163200,,447,4.174418604651163
