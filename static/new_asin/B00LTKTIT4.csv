6505134,1,B00LTKTIT4,THE WORST MOVIE EVER WADTE OF MY MONEY COULDNT EVEN STAND IT HAD TO YURN IT OFF!,1415577600,,80,3.764705882352941
8667943,4,B00LTKTIT4,"This is a movie about a  narcissistic scientist ,who is either mentally ill or has really murdered his wife and accidentally killed his son at the same time. The film gets sillier and sillier and less believable and I actually did laugh. The sounds are not aggravating ,like you think they would be....He controls his neighbors and the police, but he is not good at hypnotizing people, because you cannot tell someone to behave: You must be specific. The mind does not work like this....",1533513600,,487,4.729411764705882

8667945,4,B00LTKTIT4,"There's a decadent fantasy here and the audience might just want to relate or vicariously share the main character's enjoyment of his power. And the film is also just original and quirky enough that I can go 4/5. However, it's also a bit messy and at times unsavory and, well, just isn't going for top shelf. It set out to be a full-value, I-am-what-I-am, dirty-secret 7/10.",1530230400,,374,4.681818181818182
8667946,4,B00LTKTIT4,"This was the second of a poop happens and then you die movies I watched in the same evening the other was Storytelling. I cant say I can agree with the bad reviews but it is quirky, funny and off beat so if those work for then you shouldnt be disappointed. You have to stay to the end because the ending is 5-stars and how Robert handles his new found power is a hoot at times. Its more a dark comedy than a Sci-Fi with some rather heavy physiological overtones but it moves along nicely and the limited cast and sets aren't an issue.",1524355200,,534,4.144230769230769

8667948,1,B00LTKTIT4,Im a musician. I play synthesizers and experiment with sound. I was expecting something that resembles electronic sound/music. I couldn't have been more wrong. On the back of the DVD it says he hypnotizes woman with sound and sleeps with them. That sounds like a sexy/unique idea for a movie. There wasn't any T&A in the movie. I found myself fast forwarded throughout the whole movie. Its such a let down when you read an awesome movie plot but then it sucks.,1498003200,,460,4.621951219512195
8667949,1,B00LTKTIT4,This is subtitled...why don't they ever indicate that a movie is subtitled before you buy it.,1474934400,,93,4.875
8667950,5,B00LTKTIT4,"I am so happy this movie was made. It was a great idea that could have been a Twilight Zone or even an X-files episode. I thought the actors were perfectly cast. The story was so dark and twisted. It was very Shakespearian, with the ghosts of his family haunting him and telling him where he's going wrong. Just when it couldn't get darker, it kept going and going. Brilliant. But not everyone's cup of tea.",1454889600,,407,4.368421052631579
8667951,4,B00LTKTIT4,"**Spoiler alert**
A very impressive story that maintained internal consistency flawlessly. It is about a creepy loner who lives in his little world of HiFi and sound recording systems. He stumbles upon a sound pattern that controls those who hear it. When a new couple moves in next door, he wastes no time in using his device on them. This allows him to act upon his own sexual needs and his desire to control. The story progressed in a logical way, right up until the end. There is brief partial nudity (there could have been more considering the storyline), and mild sex. I thought it explored the intensity of a man's baser desires well.
A movie I will watch again down the track, and I hope there will more to come from the writer/director Antonio Tublen.",1451520000,,760,4.595588235294118
