As I'm writing this review, people across the United States are rebelling - rightfully so - against the pillage from Wall Street. ""The Revolutionary"" takes us to the late sixties, when the country was in turmoil, documenting yet another period when people were fighting the good fight. This is a passionate and intriguing film that represented that period, and t will resonate with you today.

Produced by Edward Pressman, one of my all-time favorite filmmakers, and directed by Paul Williams, the movie opens with a ""somewhere in the free world,"" and we are taken to a ghetto-like city, which reminded me of ""1984."" We immediately meet the character played by a funny-walking Jon Voight, who is referred to as ""A."" He belongs to a group of college students and faculty that opposes the system. He is smart, and figures out that this group was not going to accomplish anything. He then quits by pointing out to his partners that the group ""is a joke,"" and that they were ""trying to deal with this people in their terms,"" and they didn't have a chance, telling them, ""You are a bunch of boy-scouts"" From then on, he wanders around, trying to continue to fight for his ideals with other people, eventually meeting Despard (a young Robert Duvall), who is also an organizer for workers rights, as well as Leonard II (Seymour Cassel), another radical, with different ideas. In the meanwhile, ""A"" finds time for love with Helen (Jennifer Salt), a rich girl, and even joins the army. All these relationships will shape ""A's"" future.

""The Revolutionary"" is not your typical political movie. It is slow-paced, with few action sequences. It rather documents the evolution of a radical student -- sometimes naive -- (revolutionary, in some circles), who is trying to make a difference for the working class. I shall add that it is also curious to see the evolution of Voight himself. In this film he plays an idealistic individual, and these days he is into right-wing politics. This DVD is an MGM Limited Collection product, and its availability depends on its demand. (USA, 1970, color, 100 mins). Exclusively reviewed on October 4, 2011 by Eric Gonzalez.
