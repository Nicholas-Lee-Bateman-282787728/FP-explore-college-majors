451005,5,6302309522,"Great acting, story, and scenery. This has to be one of the most overlooked movies in history. I owned it originally on Laserdisc and was hoping for an eventual release on DVD. I imagine the popularity of Elijah Wood has a lot to do with this.

As previously stated, the cinematography in this movie is outstanding. The acting by both, and very young, Thora Birch and Elija Wood is incredible. Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith also give high caliber performances and the chemistry between them is superb. I can't say enough about the acting as the supporting cast is also very good. Why there were no academy award nominations for this movie is a mystery to me. It most likely has to do with the lack of respect for Don Johnson's acting ability and the fact that he is not on the A list.

The story is also well written and quickly drags you in.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and on my 10 best list.",1093996800,30,889,4.441717791411043
451006,5,6302309522,"If you have never been introduced to Thora Birch-this is the one to see.  I don't know if this was her first movie or not but she is really young in this film. If there were ever a star born ""this is it"". She is just unbelievable.  Griffin and Johnson are really great too.  This movie is actually worth watching for the scene location alone.",1087948800,9,342,4.230769230769231
451007,4,6302309522,"""Paradise"" reveals much about children of people who don't take the time to care/supervise their kids and have no father. While the film is basically a drama, its strength comes from dealing with the conflict of being forced into a lifestyle one would not voluntarily choose after a parent's remarriage. Nevertheless, the film portrays children as resilient, capable of not only facing such challenges, but mastering them.
This is definitely a movie parents should view and discuss with their kids. So many topic are presented, some directly and others in a more subtle manner, including, authority, creativity, punishment, rebellion, justice, discipline, practice, seeking approval, friendship, becoming part of something larger than yourself, pride, and lessons one learns outside of the classroom. The camera work and direction is superb and worthy of larger budget films, the acting is outstanding in word and deed. And the sound track, including music and sound effects is one of Donoghue's best efforts.
There is a certain ""cuteness"" to it, but the overall tone of the film is super and the presentation by the young people makes you proud of their efforts. Every 11-year-old must learn to make his or her way in the world by fitting in. However painful the experience of growing up is, we tend to forget it as the years pass.
This movie makes adults ponder the uncertainty of youth and many will have had the revelation of Billie by the end of the film. If you are capable of serious thought, ""Paradise"" will make you think about life differently. Paradise is a great movie. is an up and rising movie sensation. The rest of the cast isn't bad either. If I could buy this movie I would. It is the story of a boy named Willard who is sent to his aunt and uncle's, who are trying to survive a tradgedy in the summer. The rest you'll have to see for yourself. Once again Thora Birch shows us that she is an awesome actress. She plays all her parts so well and I know she works hard for what shes earned. She's pretty and a talented actress. Elijah Wood is great in this movie and makes it enjoyable to watch. .I think that Paradise was awesome. Melanie Griffith did a great job. Elijah Wood was great. He worked hard and he looked great in the movie. You would love it. The chemistry between Elijah's character and Thora's character was the best I've seen.",1080950400,5,2359,4.728155339805825
451008,3,6302309522,"I submitted a review of this movie to IMDB three times.  None was published, nor did I ever hear why.  I suspect it was because not one of the several previous reviewers even mentioned or seemed aware of its source material, though it is prominent in the credits.  It is gratifying to see at least one commentary here on Le Grand Chemin, a minor classic from 1987 that became a vehicle for Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, who had some large French shoes to fill, and somewhat surprisingly, did a good job.  Changing the setting from the French countryside to our New England was both good news and bad, possibly because the story elements were so typically French.  Only the cinematography is as good as the original.
Elijah Wood and Thora Birch also more than hold their own in the crucial children's roles, particularly Birch, who seems to have studied the French version and her counterpart therein more closely than any of the other leads in Paradise, and steals the picture in possibly the best performance of her childhood years.  As a saucy, irreverent 9-year-old country girl, she teaches city boy Wood a thing or two in charming fashion.
The bonding of Don and Elijah is deftly portrayed, and Don and Melanie's separate forms of grieving over their dead infant son are well acted.  The supporting roles are strongly realized, and the ending more or less happy and ""feel-good.""
See it if you can--and also Le Grand Chemin.",1050192000,7,1432,4.75

PARADISE: Schools out for summer, and ten-year-old Willards (Wood) mom, pregnant and abandoned, ships him off for a vacation to the rural South Carolina home of her oldest friends, the Reeds. Hes barely there before he meets precocious tomboy Billie (Birch), who shows him the sights: the river, the fire tower, the local witch, her older sister in the shower.

What could be an idyllic summer turns sour, however, as Willard discovers hes walked into the middle of a tense situation. Ben (Johnson) and Lilys (Griffith) marriage is on the rocks, due to a recent tragedy. But will Willards presence accentuate the wedge between them, or can it act as a catalyst for their reconciliation?

Discussion: One thing you cant hide, John Lennon sang, is when you're crippled inside. But many of us spend much of our lives and emotional energies attempting to do just that. Ben and Lily are two such people; as much the victims of tragedy as their lost child. The performances are the highlights of this effectively affecting adult drama, and its leisurely pace allows the time to show subtleties of character as well as the minute gradations of their changes.
The kids come across cute, when there was a real risk that bad casting would make them look like brats. But Johnson and Griffith (husband and wife at the time of filming) both shine as the quiet, low-key couple with real electricity in their glances and coursing beneath the surface of their strained relationship. The anguish they act out is honest; their tenderness impressive, and their attic catharsis blends brilliant monolog pieces into heartwrenching confessions.

There are many deep themes woven into this bittersweet film: Adult problems seen through a childs eyes, with all the attendant pain and confusion; the tenuous grip we have on one another; the agony of missing fathers, of families in crisis, of facing fears; and the difficultyand sheer magicof simply connecting with another human being. Curiously, critics decry that there aren't enough films like thisand then ignored this perfect example.",1422576000,,2320,4.941025641025641

451194,4,6302309522,"The first half of 1991's ""Paradise"" is great. It's essentially a coming-of-age story of two 9 year-olds (Elijah Wood and Thora Birch) on the Atlantic coast near Chrarleston, SC (shot on location). The locations are breathtaking and illustrate that every area has its unique beauty. The film's also about a couple who Elijah is visiting for the Summer (Birch's character is a neighbor). The couple (Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) are on the verge of divorce due to a tragedy a few years earlier. Wood's visit is instrumental in reviving them as individuals and as a couple.

The first half is so well done that I thought I stumbled upon a hidden gem but, unfortunately, the second half falls into mediocrity. The awkward and contrived scenes with questionable acting/dialogue could've worked if the filmmakers simply worked out the kinks through rewriting, reshooting, better editing, etc. but it's clear that they had to finish the picture on a limited budget. They got the job done, and that's great, but if they spent a little more time, a little more money and tried a little harder they could've had a near masterpiece.

This is the only movie that I can remember where Don Johnson plays a major protagonist (I've never seen Miami Vice) and it shows that he should've been a major ultra-cool masculine actor, like Clint Eastwood, Thomas Jane, Charles Bronson and a gazillion others.

Sarah Trigger plays Birch's hot half-sister, but she's barely seen, which is a shame because she's so beautiful. They probably cut some of her scenes out. If you don't remember her, she played Steve Martin's redhead babe in ""Grand Canyon.""

BOTTOM LINE: This coming of age film has numerous great moments, particularly in the first half -- moments of wonder, beauty, discovery and companionship. It's too bad they drop the ball in the second half. Regardless, it's a very worthwhile movie and Johnson shows his greatness. Like the movie, he coulda been a contenda.

The film runs 111 minutes.

451195,5,6302309522,"Sometimes we use the word ""classic"" a little too freely, but truly this movie is a classic!!  The story is beautiful and heartbreaking, the scenery (filmed in South Carolina I believe)  ethereal, along with great music by David Newman. Every performance is uncannily topnotch.  Very few children can pull off such intense rolls as well as Elijah Wood and Thora Burch did in this movie.  Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson have never given more poignant performances!  They make your heart break for them, as each struggles with overwhelming grief and the isolation that Griffith's character imposes. Willard and Lily both struggle with fear and overcome it together. Willard brings with him such an honest, humble heart and his sweetness begins to break down the wall of fear and pain in the Reed home. Except for a couple of unnecessary nude scenes, this movie is PERFECT!  Louise Latham has a cameo roll that is central to the encouragement and future of little Billy Pike.

451322,5,6302309522,"I'm a fan of Don Johnson, at least of his early and mid-career films. ""Lovely"" is a good description of Don Johnson, one of the great male beauties in American cinema. His sheer presence is such that one cannot help but root for him. Admittedly, Johnson was an even prettier man, so fresh-faced and svelt, in his twenties, when he did such frisky (and sometimes even nakedly exhibitionistic roles; in his case, ""Strip, Don, take it all off!"") in films of his twenty-something youth like ""The Harrad Experiment"" (the uncensored original), ""Return to Macon County"", ""A Boy and His Dog"", and other films of that time of his life. Even by the time of ""Miami Vice"", for TV, he still was strikingly beautiful, though not quite so much so as earlier.

Don Johnson, the sweet-looking (as well as salty and quirky) young dude from Missouri, certainly looks great in ""Paradise"" with his wife of that time co-starring with him. I originally wrote the essence of these comments to attach to someone else's review, but decided to recast them for a brief review of my own, more to do a Quebecker's homage to Don Johnson than to describe ""Paradise"" itself in detail (which other reviews have done quite adequately), since Don Johnson is one of my favourite American actors. (Incidentally, Don Johnson was a superbly gifted singer, as well, as his recordings and YouTube vocals demonstrate.)

Anyway, any film with Don Johnson in his twenties or thirties is worth watching! His physical radience still shines through in ""Paradise"". With such looks, he could have succeeded as a lesser actor, but, in fact, Don Johnson's acting is always engaging and expert. In ""Paradise"" he has a role of substance as well, as always, of charm, and Do Johnson excels in it!",1303516800,,1741,4.8193979933110365

This movie is a classic piece of a disturbed marital relationship that is rekindled by a summer guest, (Elijah Wood), who thus restores Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson's passion for one another.

This sensitive motion picture deals with how the human soul reacts to personal loss and how it changes lives. The kind of movie you want to own so you can revisit it from time to time since its theme touches us all deeply.
The scenery is georgeous, the town is small and peaceful. The characters are meaningful and real.
Unspoken bonds run deep throughout.
A heartfelt film that captures our yearning for a father. This is a soul changing journey for a childless man who never got to be one for very long. At first indifferent and angry, he inadvertently discovers something which he thought he might never experience, through the inescapable and magical innocence of a visiting young boy who seems to somehow understand his plight.
Both he and his wife find themselves confronted in a way that changes them forever.
This film is a forgotten gem.
It just gets more and more beautiful with every viewing.
Not a box office hit since it's not really entertainment in the traditional sense. It pushes buttons that are uncomfortable but it's also filled with humor and the scenic beauty of rural south Carolina.

451375,4,6302309522,"(Warning:  Contains plot spoilers, but if you haven't seen this film, read this review anyway.  You'll be convinced that this movie is a film you should see.)

I remember, back in 1991, when I was sitting in a theatre, watching as the end credits rolled, thinking to myself:  ""This film is going to be a huge hit, and it'll go on to be a classic.""

Well, it wasn't much of a financial success; after about a month, it was gone from the theatres.  To the best of my knowledge, neither Roger Ebert nor any other critic of note thinks of this film as a classic.

Funny thing is, everyone I've ever showed this film to, especially those of the feminine persuasion, has been entralled by this film.

Go figure.

Elijah Wood is perfectly cast as Willard in this role; he plays something of a noble innocent, much like he does in ""TLOTR"" trilogy.  His best buddy, enacted by a very spunky, outspoken Thora Birch, wins over the audience almost instantly, as we come to know her as a very intelligent and kind-hearted young lady.  And yet Miss Birch never steals the spotlight from Elijah; even back then, she was such a good actress that she could play her part most effectively and still not step on the other actor's toes.

That brings us to the adults; Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith play Ben and Lily Reed, a couple in the aftermath of their son's accidental death.  Ben is a man trying to reach out to his wife, while his wife Lily  punishes herself by refusing any comfort her husband may be able to offer.

Don Johnson very much does NOT play Sonny Crockett  here.  There's none of Crockett's cockiness, nor is he a jaded man-of-the-world like Nash Bridges.  ""Ben"" is a shrimp boat captain, estranged from his wife after the accidental death of their son; he's a good-natured man eternally in a foul humor.  And yet he is harboring hope that somehow, a way forward, beyond trajedy, shall be found.

Melanie Griffith plays her part more quietly and more subtly than anything else I've ever seen from her; her portrayal of Lily as a woman of great emotional depth who is, at the same time, very much someone you'd converse at the local coffee shop; she seems to be everyone's friend, yet she is alone in her suffering.

Enter Willard; both adults form a deep bond with him, which stands in stark contrast to the gulf that exists between themselves.  This bond that Ben and Lily form with Willard, both individually and together, helps them to draw a bit closer to one another, and to begin to confront the pain that is tearing their home, and their marriage, apart.  The issue confronting each of these three is courage; Elijah must find the courage to face issues in his life back home, and Ben and Lily have to find the courage to face the pain that is destroying so much of their lives.

The great thing about this film is that, in the end, all loose ends are NOT tied up.  There's issues in Elijah's life he still must face, but he leaves Ben and Lily with a better understanding of who he is, and what sort of courage lies within him.  As you'll see in the film's conclusion, things are not ""all fine and dandy"" for Thora Birch's character either; and Ben and Lily, whilst having found one another again, still have a life to try to rebuild.

And that's the point:  There are no perfect fixes, and things don't always end happily, if they ever find their conclusion at all.  The point here is that sometimes we meet people who help us to better know who we are, and that we have what it takes to face the things that scare us.  Victory, of course, is still quite uncertain, but at least we have the courage to stand, rather than run.  That, by itself, says something.

So why wasn't this wonderful film more successful?

My theory is that this just isn't the project that folks were expecting from Sonny Crockett teaming up with his wife, Tess McGill.  People just were NOT expecting this film, especially not from these two, and taking too much of a hard turn can turn you right over.  Perhaps that's what happened here.

This is a film that shall always be in my DVD collection; I can't imagine a film library that didn't include this movie.  It's great for family viewing, and it's also something of an educational film to show teens, as it is demonstrative of how to cope with unimaginable trajedy.  The characters don't pretend to be perfect, there's no ""now everything will be o.k."" ending, and all loose ends aren't tied up.  Yet this film does have something important to say, and it is something many people would do well to hear.

Perhaps if this film came out today, in 2010, rather than in 1991, it might find a bigger audience.  Granted, it would be promoted almost exclusively to women, but if a girlfriend dragged her man to see this, he'd most likely leave the theatre saying the following in a rather surprised, unsettled tone: ""You know ... that was a really was a good movie.""

This film came out at the wrong time, and tried to find an audience amoungst those who were expecting something much different.  Perhaps that's why it never got a fair shake, but watch it anyway; you'll never forget it, and it will find a place to reside in your heart, as great films always do.",1268179200,10,5196,4.4888178913738015

451404,5,6302309522,"A simple, old-time movie about the simple life in a small town does not change the fact that grief and estrangement are universal and cannot be ignored as if they will tippy-toe away. Secrets gnaw from the inside out.
Ben and Lily (Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) lost a young son two years earlier, so when Willard (Elijah Wood) arrives, he steps right into this scenario of estrangement and unresolved grief.

Ten-year-old Willard has come to visit because his pregnant mother wrestles with her own potential loss--Willard's father has run off with another woman--and she needs time to figure out what to do.  Willard's father becomes a pivotal point later in the story. Willard is sent to Lily because she was his mother's best friend in their girlhood days.

A bright boy, Willard senses that things are not well in this house. He makes friends with Billie, the wild girl next-door, nine-years-old and daughter of the town floozie, making this viewer ask, as always, why children must also suffer the problems of their parents.

Yes, Paradise, is an apt name for a perfect setting--fishing, swimming, warm summer days, tree rafts, boating. But, of course, it is not paradise. What then is this story about, if not an idyllic setting? It is about the daily-ness of life and how each little act leads to the next for good or bad, in the case of unresolved grief, out of avoidance, out of ignorance, out of now a set routine. That's where Willard's role is apparent. His presence presents a new paradigm, breaking the unhappy flow of energy. Not that he does this intentionally--he doesn't. He simply is a new factor to alter their energy, refocusing it back into this couple, who are so hopelessly lost in their grief.

 The plot was great. Johnson was a cold heartless man who hid his pain in anger and Griffith was a kind nurturing woman who hid it in the attic. I felt very much for the couple in the movie at age 10 and even more at 24.
 The fact that Wood and Burch bonded and shared alot was not that much different from Culkin and Chlumsky's relataionship in My Girl. They were young curious opposite sex friends who were probably closer than most of the adults around them at the time.
 I loved this movie and still do til this day. At age 10 i wanted to watch it all the time and i must've seen it at least 20 times over the years. If you haven't seen it i would recomend it. If you liked My Girl this movie is a movie for you. It's funny, heartfelt, and beautiful all in one.",1191196800,,1116,3.9466666666666668
451407,3,6302309522,"This is such a magical movie. Like the other reviewers before me, it's a collectors keepsake if you like that nostalgic, non-violent, feel good kind of real family, real deal, heart wrenching drama type of genres. For some reason reminds me alot of 'Hearts In Atlantis' or 'The War', in that sense of non-traditional, non epic film making, that comes along every once in awhile to titilate our senses. Mary Agnes Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay, if I am not mistaken, to 2002's White Oleander) directs.

Lily and Ben Reed, names I have remembered since I saw this with my brother when I was 11, have stayed with me for years. At the time, Don and Melanie were married, and they put so much emotion into their roles as parents who lost a young child, and having Willard (what an awful name) played by Elijah Wood stay with them for the summer, and watching Melanie and Don interact with him, as if he were their own son, watching him grow and learn, is truly gut wrenching and I must say kudos galore to M.Agnes D., for letting them both go with their emotions in those scenes. Watching Melanie put Willard to sleep in one scene, and her stroking his hair and watching him, I mean I was shell shocked, that pain a mother must go through to lose a son, and then having to take care of another's son and see what your boy might have looked like, what they might have smelt like, and what their hair might have been like...well that truly was very tear-jerking stuff. Truly spectacular acting, which I almost want to cringe with respect to saying that to Donnie Boy lol.

Heart felt performances, really beautiful morning cinematography, whisping Southern stereotypes done extremely well, and beautiful imagery in many aspects from the tower climbing to the wilderness; and really worth a look, and one of, if not the first roles for Elijah, right after 'Avalon' perhaps?

No need to rent this one, def. worth the purchase price. One of my favorite movies as a young boy, strange huh? lol Paradise and Goonies, oh the perpetual God's of film are like Boris Yeltzin trying to get into the old party at Spago with his hands in the air, shaking his head...'what's wrong with this movie lover...'

Throughout the years I would remember this movie every couple of years and look for it at local stores, but, would never find it. I was surfing the net one day and thought about this movie again and decided to look it up. I FOUND IT!!!!!! I was so happy. I just ordered this and I am anxiously awaiting it's arrival. I told my wife all about it and I can't wait for her to see it. It is a very well made FAMILY movie. Do yourself a favor and BUY this movie.

451410,5,6302309522,"This is a ""Collector"" movie to buy and watch again and again when the mood strikes you.  It is about ""Life"" which is never pretty all the time.  It is about coming of age, it is about love (good and bad love).  It is a movie that causes you to think about your own life and your own relationships.  And I agree with the gentleman from Michigan in the sense that this is a small town person movie.  I grew up in powdunk Texas and really relate to the dirt road mentality and the peacefulness of the lake and woods.  It has been said that when you are young you want to leave home and as you get older you want to return there.  I agree wholeheartedly.  What we seek is the peacefulness of home and the support of family there.  This movie also deals with ""Loss"" very well and how different people react to loss and how you never know how you will react to loss and how that will change your life.  If you don't agree with my rating I suggest you watch the movie again with a new perspective and I think it will speak to you differently.  Happy Day.",1162339200,35,1047,4.108374384236453
451411,5,6302309522,"someone reviewed this movie and said that it didn't flow well. Well I disagree. This movie is about life in a small town which is different from big budget movies about living in places like Los Angeles. I relate to this movie as well and it has a great love story. Nobody wants to see a boring story about things that always go right. BOOOOOORING! when you live in a small town and you're a young kid, your main concern is finding things to do. You don't always find the most POLITICALLY CORRECT things to do, you do whatever is fun. Whether it be getting into some trouble, or rebelling or whatever. I can relate to peeping on people, and just wanting to be out of the house all summer long. Maybe that's why I like this movie so much. I live in Northern Ontario on the border of Ontario and Michigan, and I heard somewhere that this movie was filmed in Paradise, Michigan. Don Johnson's character even talks about meeting his wife in Brimley, which is in Michigan and I've been there. It's a pretty nice place. I find that when you can relate to a movie, or have been to the city that it's filmed in, it makes it a lot more fun to watch.

I give the movie a 5, I'd give it more if I could. There's nothing boring about this movie. Not even for a millisecond.",1120694400,28,1261,4.232365145228216
451412,2,6302309522,"Having recently become a Don Johnson fan after seeing his marvelous performances in the ""Miami Vice"" tv series, I was very much interested in seeing him in other roles besides the never-to-be-forgotten 'Sonny' Crockett. Unfortunately, ""Paradise"" was a disappointment after my excitement to see Johnson and his wife at the time, Melanie Griffith, star together in what was supposed to be a 'family' movie.

Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith play Lily and Ben Reed, a couple torn apart after a terrible tragedy. Their love and affection for each other has died out and they live day by day hardly speaking to each other, hardly acknowledging the other's existence. That is, until a good friend's son, Willard Young (Elijah Wood), arrives in town as their summer guest. Will the Reeds finally rekindle their lost love for each other, and will young Willard, with the help of a country girl, Billie Pike (Thora Birch), learn to not be afraid?

The acting was well done and I have no qualms with any of the actors. Johnson and Griffith, by then seasoned veterans of the trade, play their roles with lots of heart and it's easy to feel for each of their characters as they strive to grasp some sort balance in their tumultuous lives. As for the younger stars, Elijah Wood and Thora Birch are also quite good for their ages. There are some awkward moments where though they are trying very hard to capture some dramatic moments, their inexperienced youth comes in the way at times. On the overall, it might be said that Birch may have been the better actress (both youths receiving 'Young Artist Award Nominations', though Birch is the only one who takes home the award for 'Best Young Actress').

I think my main problem with ""Paradise"" is with how the plot is presented. The plot is fairly good except that it is stretched too thin so that you really can't put your finger on what the message is. And when a good plot is stretched thin, too often do directors put 'unnecessary' subplots throughout the movie. But instead of doing it to make the movie flow better, the subplots in ""Paradise"" seem to burden the film with tediousness.

Not only are some of scenes out of place, they are sometimes 'cringe-worthy'. To give an example, the director wished to show a sense of every day life of the people in town. Often at times, Willard and Billie are left to their own devices to find their own amusement. And their 'amusement' consists of stealing a boat, doing dangerous stunts, and being 'peeping Toms', spying on Billie's sister and her boyfriend. Their spying on Billie's sister and her boyfriend at an 'intimate' moment was the most disturbing and disgusting. I found it totally unnecessary and made me wonder what kind of a director could ask a young actor and actress to participate in that kind of scene?

As mentioned in the above, this is NOT a family movie contrary to what some reviewers have mentioned. Besides some disturbing scenes with Billie's sister, there is also some profanity. And on the whole, the story deals with mature themes.

If taken in the right direction, ""Paradise"" may have been a good movie. Parents would have enjoyed watching the Reeds fix their broken relationship while kids might have been able to relate to Willard's struggles with the different kinds of fears he must face. But unfortunately, ""Paradise"" doesn't put too much focus on fantastic Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith while Willard's part in the movie wasn't quite uplifting or interesting. The story also ends somewhat disappointingly. There is just a hint of the 'hope' of what's to come for the characters and then immediately cuts to the closing credits. In my opinion, I would rather have seen how that summer changed their lives for the better and witnessed that change.

All-in-all, ""Paradise"" was never a big hit for a reason so if you're looking for a good drama to watch with the family, I recommend these films instead:

""Mr. Holland""s Opus"" - Starring Richard Dreyfuss, this is a great film about the life a music teacher and how he touched the lives of many.

""October Sky"" -An extremely uplifting movie about how a group of boys strived to fulfill their dreams. (Some strong language so maybe to be watched with older kids.)",1100649600,8,4230,4.7835616438356166
