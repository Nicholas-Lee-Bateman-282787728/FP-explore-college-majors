8702355,5,B00TN2CAAY,"Loved it, especially the ""Blue Velvet"" episode.  Acting was superb. The Spanish men are masculine and eye appealing and Ana is beautiful. Loved it so much, watched it a second time and hope I can purchase a DVD for American players. It is right up there with Grand Hotel including some of the same actors. The fashions in Velvet were feminine and outstanding, just like the 50's and 60's.  Wish they were back. Men looked like men and women like females.",1496880000,,454,4.592592592592593
8702356,5,B00TN2CAAY,This novela will transport you to a time which many of us were not alive to live. The scenes are so realistic that you'll feel that you are living in this decade. The love story will captivate your heart and not let you stop watching. The actors are superb and really live up to the character that they are portraying. You won't regret watching this classic which has won many awards for letting so many fall in love over and over.,1470614400,,431,4.333333333333333
8702357,5,B00TN2CAAY,"A wonderful series about 'star-crossed', lovers. Every episode is well-worth watching.  The inn-depth description of the characters is one of its best features.  Anna and Alberto do an excellent job and  their love-story seems real. It is told with much detail, but not overly.  One gets the full impact of their love, despair, and triumph.  The acting  was superb from all the actors.  Rita stands out.  Alberto dominates, but Don Emilio and Pedro are not far behind. Even the servants, such as Elvira do an excellent job in their limited roles. My only regret was  with the script using what appears to be the translation of present-day English-language phrasing and speech, translated into the Spanish.  I kept correcting much of it.  I wish it had been in true Spanish form. All in all, it was the best series I have seen yet.",1452384000,,830,4.774647887323944

8702359,5,B00TN2CAAY,"Love, love, love it.  I was distraught when Season 2 ended, and actually called Netflix yesterday to find out when Season 3 will be available.  Note: Season 3 ends in Spain on December 15, 2015.  Hope it's soon - I miss them all. What I particularly admire about the series is that the characters  - and the plot - are not always predictable. I actually believe it's done more artfully than a comparable American series would be.  Me gusta mucho!",1447372800,6,446,4.525
8702360,5,B00TN2CAAY,Love this series...waiting for the 3rd season.,1446508800,,46,5.714285714285714
8702361,5,B00TN2CAAY,I absolutely love this show.  I watched season 1 & 2 on Netflex repeatedly.  Can't wait for season 3 with English subtitles.  I have been searching online for season 3 with English subtitles with no luck.  I hope Anna & Alberto can get pass Christina & her malicious tactics to keep Alberto.  Please tell me that these DVDs have English subtitles.  I love this show & hope they renew for another season.,1445126400,3,403,4.527777777777778
8702362,5,B00TN2CAAY,"I loved Velvet Seasons 1 and 2 and am waiting for Season 3 with English subtitles.  I loved Gran Hotel too!!!  Great acting and unique plot lines in both.  Seeing Andres as Primo and Clara in completely different roles has been a great demonstration of the diversity of their talent.  Can't wait to see more, especially as Alberto fights for the love of his life and Ana joins him to do the same!!!!",1444003200,3,399,4.424657534246576
8702363,5,B00TN2CAAY,"Love this series. Loved Gran hotel too I watch them over and over... Bring more seasons and get the complete series with English subtitles.
