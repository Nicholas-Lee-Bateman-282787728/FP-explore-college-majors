7934294,1,B000059XU2,"Absolute ripoff.  The ad for this is very misleading as does imply this is season one & two, but its a mere 4 episodes.  For 20 bucks, you are thinking its the entire seasons, especially for a show from the 60's.  It doesn't outright lie, but its one of the most misleading representation I've ever seen on Amazon.  Learned my lesson, read the low reviews before ordering!!!  Would have saved my money!",1491696000,,402,4.527777777777778

I'm so glad these programs have been made available to us.",1281571200,5,304,5.122448979591836
7934303,4,B000059XU2,"I don't own this DVD however I have seen all these episodes and as this has been on the market for sometime without any reviews or episode information, I have copied the episode guide from the website: [...]  This is a great website and I would recommend checking it out if you're interested in finding other old tv series that may be available on DVD such as this to purchase through Amazon. I gave this DVD 4 stars purely based on the episodes themselves as I don't know what the DVD quality is like.
Episode 1: My Favorite Martian (The Pilot)-Trouble begins when reporter Tim O'Hara spots the crash landing of a flying saucer in the nearby woods and he nurses an injured alien-who he introduces to neighbors as ""Uncle Martin""-back to health.
Episode 2: The Matchmakers-Tim is in charge of looking after his boss's lovesick dog, George. And Martin is playing matchmaker between Tim and Marsha, the owner of the canine object of George's affections.
Episode 3: No Cure for the Common Martian-Martin has a common cold but, whenever he sneezes, he disappears. Meanwhile, Tim loses consciousness after Mrs. Brown gives him one of Martin's pills in order to keep him from also getting sick. Can Martin save the day as well as Tim's job?
Episode 4: Russians R In Season-Tim is in big trouble with the feds after he forges a letter from a ""concerned citizen"" to the newspaper he works for, protesting that the $2 billion space can't possibly work because it's based on an erroneous equation-one that only Uncle Martin could have known was in error.",1081296000,22,1543,4.714814814814815
