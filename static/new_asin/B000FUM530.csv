8126813,4,B000FUM530,"In the Sixth Season of RTA, we do not get to see much of familiar characters Sarah Stanley and Gus Pike, but the series manages to move along with the other supporting cast. Gus Pike's past is finally revealed in this season, and Sarah Stanley is all grown-up and making her own decisions regarding her future which also takes her away from Avonlea. Felicity King tries medical school, makes a success of her first year, but a personal tragedy drives her away from medicine.

There is a lot of focus on Davey Keith this season, a plot line I did not personally care for. Despite sympathizing with his plight as an orphan, I would rather have seen more focus on some of the other beloved characters such as Janet, Alec, and Hetty. I wonder if the focus on the younger characters was an attempt at trying to get a couple of more seasons in the series by following these characters as they grew up. Sadly, the appeal of the first batch of youngsters in the earlier seasons of RTA (focusing on Sarah Stanley, Felicity King, Felix King, and Gus Pike) could not be replicated with Dora, Davey, and Izzy.

The Return of Gus Pike - Felicity King struggles as the only female student in medical school, then spots her old love, Gus Pike in Halifax. The pair meet a strange woman who appears to recognize Gus' ruby ring and the name Ezekiel Crane. This prompts Gus to take the woman, Eliza back to Avonlea, in a bid to discover the truth about his past. A very poignant episode.

Lonely Hearts - Avonlea has its first annual bachelor auction with hilarious results.

Christmas in June - back at the sanatorium, Cecily gets into trouble after befriending a rascal named Louie. Note: There is a casting change - the actress that played Cecily in past seasons of RTA, i.e. Harmony Cramp is replaced by Molly Atkinson who gives a more assertive interpretation of Cecily which is apt considering all that her character has been through after her bout with TB.

Fools and Kings - with Felicity away at medical school and Daniel away on a trip, Janet finds herself at a loss as to what to do and decides to work at home for ACME company; Alex plans to induct Felix into the Knights of P.E.I.; Hetty and the Daughters of the Dominion take on their rivals, the Knights of P.E.I.

Comings and Goings - Sarah Stanley returns to Avonlea after six months, accompanied by nanny Louisa. Both Hetty and Louisa bicker (as usual) over Sarah's future, but Sarah has her own plans. Will they stop long enough to listen?

The Trouble with Davey - Rachel Lynde has her hands full caring for twins Davey and Dora, and when she suffers a stroke, Hetty King steps in to help. Rachel's son takes her back to live with him, and Hetty is left to care for the twins, finding Davey a handful.

Great Expectations - Davey Keith gets into trouble (as usual), and Hetty tries to teach him the value of school by using reverse psychology (sending him to work at the cannery). The plan backfires when Jasper Dale sympathizes with Davey's plight and acts as his mentor. It's funny how Jasper always seems to be inventing things ahead of his time but never receives the recognition or fame for it (in this episode he invents the vacuum cleaner, and Hetty gets to experience its `merits' firsthand, lol).

A Fox Tale - Felix and Izzy go into business together, starting a fox farm. Their friendship is threatened when Felix decides to take someone else as his partner because of financial constraints.

The More Things Change - Clive Pettibone and Muriel Stacey finally tie the knot.

Home is Where the Heart Is - Rachel Lynde suffers a severe stroke, and Hetty nurses her back to health. Rachel loses her ability to speak, but true to her indomitable spirit, refuses to give up.

What a Tangled Web We Weave - the White Sands hosts a grand society wedding but turns out that both the bride and groom may not come from such exalted backgrounds after all; Felix fails his English exam and may not graduate. His self-esteem takes a battering, causing him to consider leaving Avonlea.

A Time to Every Purpose - Felicity misses the registration deadline for second-year medical school and is stuck in Avonlea. Dr. Snow employs her as his assistant but she finds his approach to medicine rather old-fashioned. Felicity's childhood friend Colleen is expecting but when the delivery goes terribly awry, Felicity has doubts about her future in medicine.

Homecoming - Cecily returns home after her bout in the sanatorium but chafes under the strict supervision of her parents and family, yearning for freedom and to be treated as normal. The townsfolk's prejudice does not help either. The telephone exchange comes to Avonlea and Felicity receives some tragic news.

Final verdict - still a fun season, but missing the magic of the earlier seasons.",1290297600,,4793,4.669039145907473

8126815,5,B000FUM530,"Season-six weakens in episode consistency compared to earlier seasons. Out of 13-espisodes, 8 are pleasant, 2 break believability without the real Cecily, 2 are good, and 1 is excellent. The episode, ""A Fox Tale"", of Felix and Izzy starting a business, has some excellent scenes. The bantering between Felicity and ""that annoying boy"", Nat Lester, is very funny. The pleasant stories of Avonlea do continue.

Sarah appears in one episode.
A different actress plays Cecily, appearing and starring in two episodes. The original actress, in spite of the small part, created a likeable and memorable Cecily with a distinct personality; that she could not be replaced without notice. The two emotional Cecily episodes depend on the audience remembering and liking the original Cecily, but then switch someone else as Cecily. Who's idea was that? If they were unable to sign the original actress for another season after flowers and gifts, they would have done better to leave Cecily out entirely.

This season has less of the scenic outdoor photography that was so appealing.

The touted ""Behind-the-scenes"" is only a ""preview"" of this DVD that you have already bought, and the producer saying it is a nice season.

The writers of my favorite episodes of the early seasons, Heather Conkie, Suzette Couture, and Hart Hanson, are missing this season.

These disappointments should be forgiven, in light of this wonderful series. It really is a great series.

You should start with the first season. Seasons 1-5 are best. Charming children and adults get into fun predicaments. If you liked ""Little House on the Prairie"" or ""Anne of Green Gables""; you will like this. The realistic, likeable, characters are people that I would like to know. Avonlea is a place that I would like to visit, with beautiful countryside, farm, horses, period costumes and sets, women in pretty dresses, charm, some humor, interesting activities, and a lively pace.

Mr. Sullivan spared no expense creating fun escapades.",1157068800,,1991,5.145510835913313
8126816,5,B000FUM530,"This great family-friendly series brings back great memories from my childhood; I would definitely consider this my favorite TV show of all time! Each episode is full of sweet moments, family life, exciting adventures, beautiful scenery, and much more. The content of these is minimal: it's a very family-friendly series, with only a few episodes with some objectionable content (like the Witches of Avonlea episode in Season 1).

The storyline centers around Sarah Stanley, who comes to Prince Edward Island when her father is accused of embezzlement to live with relatives in a little town called Avonlea. As she struggles to accept her new life and get along with her strict Aunt Hettie, her stuck-up cousin Felcity King, & tormenting cousin Felix King, Sarah must accept the changes in her young life. But not everything is bad: small town life can be loads of fun, and her new Aunt Olivia is wondeful!

Check out this amazing series produced by Sullivan in Canada, the same company who brought up ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea"" in the 90's with Megan Follows. Aired in the U.S. under the title ""Avonlea"" on the Disney Channel, you will enjoy watching these fantastic episodes again and again! My favorite episodes from this season include: ""The Return of Gus Pike,"" ""What a Tangled Web We Weave,"" and ""Homecoming.""
