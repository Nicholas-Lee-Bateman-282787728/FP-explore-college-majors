3595676,5,B001G55SU0,"I find it pretty ironic and humorous, that back in the sixties, English lads were doing all they could, to obtain
the great albums from Chess & Checker in Chicago.
Now, 40 years later, us American Blues Lovers, (especially me, born & raised on the south side of Chicago), are desperately searching for this import DVD, and then trying to figure out how to convert the PAL format! (easily done with help on the web...)
The American Folk Blues Festival Series, plus this generous 156 minute dvd, is essential. Library of Congress stuff!
The pristine remastered images of German technology, makes one wish that James Brown and others, would have stopped into those studios, back in the day.
Highlights for me, were John Lee accompanied with The Eddie Taylor Band, with T-Bone on piano! And ANY footage of
Skip James, Bukka White and Son House, is a treasure. Likewise, Little Walter.
The price of this DVD keeps fluctuating on Amazon. I got mine for $29.95.
But, whatever the cost, these performanes are priceless. A Must Have.",1256169600,2,1024,4.823863636363637
3595677,4,B001G55SU0,"this footage is amazing,the cream of the crop from european folk blues festivals
however there is also a ton of german speaking between performers and ""surprise""
i didn't know what pal format meant til now,it means this video won't work in north america unless you play it on a computer,not as appealing but awesome footage of the real blues legends nonetheless",1256083200,,361,4.934426229508197
3595678,5,B001G55SU0,"This DVD is a collection of the American Folk Blues Festival artists filmed on regional TV in Germany in 1967, 1968 and 1969. A couple of years ago we had the amazing British Tours DVD released which included Howlin Wolf's greatest filmed work among other great performances such as rare footage of Little Brother Montgomery, Otis Rush, Fred Below, young Junior Wells and others. This set is on the same level (or better!). It consists of a series (3) of German TV shows that were broadcast in Europe in the late 1960s. They are all in concert format (not on stages or sets as in some of the AFBF releases) and in black and white (please see my review of this great disc; The American Folk Blues Festival: The British Tours 1963-1966 for detailed information).

Well this is an all new set beginning with an extended set of Little Walter Jacobs doing ""My Babe"" who also does ""Juke"" listed as ""Untitled"" (well a version of it) and ""Mean Old World"" and does a few other items as a sideman. Walter plays fantastic harp without a ""green bullet"" mike or tube amp (which he and Snooky Pryor made famous). He just plays acoustic harp with his hands through a PA. It is by far the best record we have of his talent. Listen to the tonal qualities with just his hands and mouth in the ""Untitled""-""Juke"" tune he was an innovator! Some may remember the snippet of him on an earlier American Folk Blues Festival (Number 3) with Koko Taylor and Hound Dog Taylor. This is a whole set, filmed on the same tour, and its great- worth the whole price of the DVD!!! Even at $40 US!!

The section with Koko Taylor (young) who has recently passed away a couple of months back is also incredible - this is rare footage of the ""Queen Of Chicago Blues"" as her best- what a strong voice! She offers us her usual ""Wang Dang Doodle"", her biggest hit and a great version too. She has Little Walter on harp. Koko also does ""What Kind of Man Is This (spine chilling!) and a great version of Earl Hooker's ""Will My Man Be Home Tonight"" (also done as an instrumental ""I Wonder Why"" by Otis Rush). No wonder Willie Dixon loved her so much. Hound Dog Taylor a great slide player little known outside of Chicago until much later does his Elmore James-style tune ""Roll Your Moneymaker"" with Little Walter on harp and the great Odie Payne on drums.

We also see Skip James doing a great version of his ""Hard Times Killing Floor Blues"" and this was just before he died. Son House plays in his own original, powerful style with his famous ""Dead Letter Blues"". Bukka White (BB King's cousin) performs a classic Delta Blues tune ""Aberdeen Mississippi Blues"" with his famous slapping on his guitar.

 In the second show we have John Lee Hooker playing with Eddie Taylor's band (rare!!!). It features Big Walter Horton on harp and Jerome Arnold on Bass (who played with Howlin Wolf and The Butterfield Blues Band) and has T-Bone Walker on piano, yes piano! Later T-Bone takes to the guitar for ""Stormy Monday"" again worth the price of the whole thing! Wait-it's not over yet!! We see rare footage of Big Walter ""Shakey"" Horton doing Little Walter's ""Juke"" and then another highlight- the only footage available of Jimmy Reed, yes Jimmy Reed with Eddie Taylor, again ""worth the..."" He does ""Big Boss Man"". He plays his famous harmonica on its ""holder"" while playing guitar that was later used by Bob Dylan and other Folk artists. Big Joe Williams offers ""Cryin' Shame"" and his most famous tune ""Baby Please Don't Go"" on his famous 9-string guitar. This is a delightful performance. I had the good fortune to see this very instrument at the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale Mississippi when I was there last May.

In the final show we see Earl Hooker (rare!) doing ""Off The Hook"", ""Walking The Floor"" and ""Rocket 88"" just fantastic for a person who died at age 40 and has always been underappreciated except by guitarists. Ronnie Earl took his stage name from the great Earl Hooker. We also have the equally rare Magic Sam Maghett doing ""All Your Love"" and again hardly any footage exists of this blues legend (Just as a note: Sam is using Earl Hooker's Les Paul, the legend has it that Magic Sam didn't own a guitar or just used the house band's instruments and so on, I guess this proves it!). He died within months after this concert.

Other artists showcased in this series include the great innovative Clifton Chenier, the strange ""Whistling"" Alex Moore, drummer Odie Payne, Juke Boy Bonner, the fantastic Carey Bell comes out at the end of the final show and has Magic Sam on guitar and Piedmont Blues legend John Jackson. There is also interesting footage of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGee in the first show and it is amongst the best I've ever seen, they even do ""Rock Island Line"" as a tribute to the European Folk/Skiffle craze! And it's great!

If you love the classic blues, you must get this DVD, it represents more classic performances by rare artists, captured within years of their most famous tunes, innovation and vitality. I cannot rate this show high enough! Worth any price!

However, Jimmy Reed's only one tune, T-Bone in full flight (why don't they release the PBS special he did with Shuggie Otis and others about 1975 just before his death), Big and Little Walter (WOW), rare footage of a young Eddie Taylor, the only footage of the great Magic Sam and a timely retrospective for the great Koko Taylor makes this the greatest Blues release in years. Five stars is not enough, this will be a major treasure in your blues DVD collection.

Just a final note: the interviews and narration are in German, which is interesting, but be sure to turn on the sub-titles if you want to know what is being said. The show is 156 minutes long.",1246924800,19,5707,4.575342465753424

8303866,5,B001G55SU0,"Those of us Europeans whom the blues found and kept in the 1960's tend to wax especially lyrical when reminded of the annual American Folk Blues Festival tours, and with good reason. For most of us it was the entry point into the live blues arena. We remember in vivid detail who we first saw; J B Lenoir in his leopard skin tail-coat, Big Joe Williams with his bow tie askew, Magic Sam in his natty three piece suit. The inventory stretches on, and the folks who brought those troupes of legends every year for almost a decade, German-based Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau, were promoters with a specific mission and a vision to accompany it.

Over the last few years, Hip-O have released a total of five DVD's drawn from the German, Belgian, Danish and British television broadcasts that showcased these annual extravaganzas. Now, astonishingly, we are presented with what aficionados believed to be the ""lost' years, 1967 to 1969.

The artists include many almost-mythical figures, but few more so than Little Walter. Until now there was only one rather desultory performance available on Hip-O, but suddenly we are confronted by three much better examples of his art. They are not, I grant you, anywhere near his original power, but they are still Walter and still very worthwhile, especially an untitled instrumental that bears no relation to anything in his recorded legacy. You will also encounter the only known Jimmy Reed footage and again, although it's not Jimmy at his best, from the distant shores of 40 years on it's still an absorbing experience. There's good John Lee Hooker, very good Son House, electrifying Magic Sam and superb Juke Boy Bonner -the only available footage of him.  There's 36 performances by 22 artists here, almost three hours worth of good, great and only occasionally pedestrian performances, and it's probably already the Blues reissue of the year.",1286323200,,1884,4.936908517350158
8303867,1,B001G55SU0,"After reading other reviews regarding not being able to play DVD in USA on a DVD player because of PAL format, I did my own research ala Google.  THEY WERE RIGHT!! Turns out in the 1960s videotaping (in Europe) used the PAL standard as opposed to the NTSC standard.  So what...right? Wrong! Anything originally recorded in PAL format (converted to DVD) will most likely NOT play on USA modern DVD player. USA Region 1 modern DVD players are compatible with DVDs of original recorded NTSC format.  So what that does mean? IT WON""T PLAY ON USA DVD PLAYER!!! But it will play on your computer. I for one am not likely to sit in front of my computer for 156 minutes even with my 27"" computer screen and Bose sound system.",1264896000,9,717,4.458015267175573
8303868,4,B001G55SU0,"A must see if your a blues fan, early video of some of America's most well known blues musicans.  Recorded in Europe so everything is in a foreign language, except for the performances.",1262995200,,185,4.606060606060606
8303869,4,B001G55SU0,"I waited with great anticipation for this release.  I own the other DVDs in the ""American Folk Blues Festivals"" series and was anxious for this one.  Once again, the line-up of artists for this series of shows is awesome.  The German audiences are somewhat subdued, but the respect paid the stars for their performances is genuine.

The shows:
1967 Highlights:  Little Walter ""My Babe,""  Son House ""Death Letter Blues,"" Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee's stomping version of ""Rock Island Line,"" and all things Koko Taylor
1968 Highlights:  Three words - John Lee Hooker
1969 Highlights:  Alex Moore ""Whistling Alex Moore Blues,"" Earl Hooker ""Off The Hook,"" and Magic Sam

The Dub is the Rub because on my copy each show starts out with sound and picture in-sync, but over the course of each show a gap develops that widens as much as 5 seconds by the end.  This is annoying to watch.  The John Lee Hooker set on the 1968 show is probably the best in-sync performance.  I also noted some funky, 1960's picture overlay attempts on the 1969 show.  The effect was less than spectacular.  I also struggled with the lack of English sub-titles on much of the interview footage.

In the end the concert footage is good, but hard to watch with the sound dub issue.  The DVD is a great listen though, and, if you enjoy Blues...buy it for the listen.",1260489600,,1335,4.641025641025641
8303870,4,B001G55SU0,"OK, I too was excited to see the contents of this DVD while checking it out online here at Amazon. It is indeed an impressive collection of footage of these legendary artists, and I believe that ANY footage of these legends is something important to cherish in any blues enthusiast's DVD collection. However, the performances are a mixed bag. Several are great, some are OK, and a lot of them are just plain BAD, sorry. I don't mean to run down any of these legends--I respect them all--it's just that a lot of the performances captured here definitely do NOT accurately represent their complete artistry and musical abilities. Maybe the fact that that they were out of their element and being televised (unusual for most of them) in Germany (obviously a few miles away from  home) made some of them feel uncomfortable or out of place.

I thought the performances by Little Walter (definitely the rarest and most important footage in this collection), Koko Taylor, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, Son House, Hound Dog Taylor, Bukka White, Magic Sam, John Jackson, Carey Bell, and Skip James were either great or at least good. John Lee Hooker was great by himself, but the producers of the show mistakenly put the Eddie Taylor Band and T-Bone Walker on piano backing him up on ""Maudy"". A disaster! Total confusion of chord changes ensued--a real mess. I wonder if John Lee Hooker was thinking, ""Why are these bozos having these guys play behind me?"" Hooker's only accompaniment should have been his own toe tapping. And then they had John Lee stand up (?) and sing ""Shake It Baby"", and it sounded like he didn't really know the words and was just making things up. I got the impression he was ASKED to sing the song, whether he knew it or not. Not sure how all that was really arranged, but it definitely fell flat. Earl Hooker's performance was also an under-representation of his abilities. There is a little bit of backstage footage of him just ripping through some impressive guitar runs, making you think, ""Oh man, this is going to be great when he steps out onstage!"" But alas, in addition to his guitar playing in this performance being rather ordinary, his performance consists largely of him just clowning around--playing with his teeth (quite badly), and leaving the guitar on the stool and walking away. I'm not sure if this kind of showmanship was typical for him or not, I just know that he was a highly respected guitarist, and his recordings prove this. This performance didn't, however.

Clifton Chenier's performance was unbearably bad--his singing was awful. I couldn't watch more than 15 seconds of it. An off night, I guess, because he is also highly regarded. I never took to zydeco music, however. An accordion playing blues? I never got that. I would think that he would be best categorized as a Cajun folk artist rather than a blues artist, but I dunno...

I was really impressed with the performances by Big Joe Williams and John Jackson--they both greatly exemplified the blues styles of their respective home regions. Great stuff!

Another complaint I have is the English subtitles feature. It's there in the DVD menu for you to turn on, and the subtitles do appear in some places where people are speaking German, but for some reason there are several parts of the DVD where the MC and several German interviewees are speaking German and there are NO subtitles. What gives? As an extra irritation, these interview and discussion portions with no subtitles seem to go on FOREVER, so there's quite a few minutes of this DVD that is useless for viewers who don't understand German.

So do I recommend this CD? Yes, if only for the good parts, which easily outweigh the few lousy performances. And anyway, having a lousy performance of a blues legend on video is better than not having any footage of them at all! :-)",1259280000,,3839,4.748125937031484
