8004057,2,B0000W5J68,"Unlike many of the other Franklin DVDs, this DVD only has three Franklin stories, i.e. Franklin's Valentines, Franklin Takes a Trip, and Franklin and the Tooth Fairy. The fourth story included on this DVD is not a Franklin story, but an episode of Rolie Polie Olie, which my 4-year-old didn't care for. This is not a value for money compilation compared to many of the other Franklin DVDs.",1238112000,,389,4.735294117647059
8004058,2,B0000W5J68,"This DVD is something of a disapointment because it only has 3 Franklin stories on it and one of them is Franklin and the Tooth Fairy, which we already have on 3 other DVDs! The other Franklin bonus story is Franklin Takes a Trip, which is an OK story. The 4th ""bonus story"" is really a Rolie Polie Olie story. Who wants that when they've ordered a DVD of Franklin?",1200009600,2,365,4.228571428571429
