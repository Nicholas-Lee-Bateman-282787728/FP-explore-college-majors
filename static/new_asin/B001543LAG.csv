8257486,2,B001543LAG,"I liked the movie ""Ray"" with Jamie portracting Ray Charles; but that is the only movie worth looking at.  I purchased the film collection thinking that it was 8 movies; but it is only 3-4 actual movies - the rest is directors talking about how the movie was made.  Ray Charles DVD of song proformance is great and the cover design is good. So the things I like about the collection out weight the missing movies.  However, if I had known it was not actually eight movies - I would not have purchased it.",1380672000,2,503,4.329787234042553
