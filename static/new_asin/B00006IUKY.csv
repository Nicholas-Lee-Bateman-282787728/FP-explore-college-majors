2953516,4,B00006IUKY,Apparently coming of age in Budapest isn't much different than in the US.  The film is well captured with a strong performance by its leading lady and as well as the rest of the cast.  Reminded me of the Dreamlife of Angels in many ways.  Contrasting the hard grind of manual labor with the nightlife of an urban city.  One moment the lead girl is filthy dressed in work clothes - the next she is in a mini skirt and skimpy top partying on the town.  Profound in the way we see her trying to make the best of her plight.,1062460800,7,520,4.108910891089109
2953517,4,B00006IUKY,If you are looking for a Hungarian speaking DVD than this is a good buy. The film itself is not so exciting. I do like that they speak Magyarul. The music is very interesting but the same song is played too much. If you miss Hungary and want to see and hear about Hungarians than you will like this film. If you are looking for a super exciting film than this is not it. I like the Hungarian language spoken and for that reason alone I am glad I bought the film.,1043107200,6,462,4.032608695652174

8219967,3,B00006IUKY,A rather hackneyed theme of nave country girl going to the big city and mixing with the wrong crowd. Moderately interesting and quite well acted.,1464220800,,145,4.84
8219968,3,B00006IUKY,"Descent movie, but seemed to end before the plot was complete!",1444608000,,62,4.7272727272727275
8219969,1,B00006IUKY,"True confession:  I haven't finished this movie.  Perhaps I will, but probably not soon.  I need a break from it.  To me, it is a slow and tedious tale about a young woman coming to Budapest to find a better life for herself.  I stopped at about the two-thirds complete point at which she seems bent on finding a man.  I was drawn to the movie because I wanted a movie about Budapest, and this one falls short of my expectations.  There really have been no scenes of Budapest the city while driving around.  In contrast, for example, the movie ""A Separation"" takes place in Tehran, Iran, and the viewer sees much of the city and also also learns relevant aspects of Iranian people's lives and culture.  ""I Love Budapest"" isn't giving me that kind of experience.",1441756800,,761,4.4963503649635035
8219970,1,B00006IUKY,"Poor acting.  Concept was fine, but imlementation was awful.  Ending was corny.  Some foreign films are top notch, but this isn't one of them.",1389139200,,142,4.833333333333333
8219971,3,B00006IUKY,"She starts out hopeful as she hooks up with a friend in Budapest but almost immediately her outlook is shocked into a grim awareness that things are not going to be easy. She gets a dispiriting job in a dilapidated factory, shares a tiny apartment with her friend who shows her how to keep the men interested. And through it all one is never sure if she has the smarts and moral courage to make the necessary choices. The look and feel of this movie has the ring of truth if only because of the use of unadorned locations but because the actor who plays the naive country girl thrust into the heartless grind of modern city life plays her role with great restraint and sensitivity. The unhurried pace especially in pensive moments allows us to witness her struggle to stay true to herself. This is a thoroughly enjoyable look at one persons attempt to succeed in life but has to settle for survival. A truly universal story.",1388707200,,924,4.505952380952381
8219972,4,B00006IUKY,"""I Love Budapest"" is one of those self-discovery films where a young protagonist from the country heads out to the city to cash in on all the excitement. One of the best examples of the genre may be ""Midnight Cowboy"".

 ""Midnight Cowboy"" this is not but ""I Love Budapest"" managed to cast me under its spell. I cared about the protagonst, a young girl named Aniko (Gabriella Harmori) and didn't want any harm to come her way.

 Aniko is from the countryside and goes to Budapest to meet a friend, Moni (Martina Kovacs), who tells her how great things are in the city. When Aniko arrives however she finds her friend's stories may have been a bit exaggerated. Moni is barely getting by, living in a cheap apartment and hanging around the wrong group of friends (her boyfriend deals with drugs).

 What will happen to the young country girl? Will the big city corrupt her? The questions may sound simplistic but ""I Love Budapest"" never becomes a predictable bore. The film seems to care about these characters and tries to flesh them out.

 Gabriella Harmori is a very good actress. I saw her in a comedy which was a smash hit in Hungary called ""Stop Mom Theresa (Allitsatok meg Terezanyut)"". While that film was not a favorite of mine I did recognize Harmori's talent. She is a very capable actress. So far I've only seen her play the innocent type but I think she can play more than that. I hope she finds great success.

 If there is a downside to the film it is techincal. It seems to have been shot with poor camera equipment or I saw a bad transfer. Either way the image is not crisp and some of the camerawork I found uninspired, meaning I didn't like the way certain scenes were shot and found the camera moving for no reason at all.

 In the end though ""I Love Budapest"" is worth seeing for its heartfelt theme and the exceptional performance given by Gabriella Harmori.

 p.s. Sandor Csanyi has a small part as one of Moni's friends. He also appeared in ""Stop Mom Theresa"" with Hamori. He is one of the top leading men in Hungarian cinema.

 Bottom-line: Effective film about growing up and self-discovery. Never cheaply sentimental. Strong performance given by Gabriella Hamori.",1200787200,7,2186,4.595360824742268
8219973,5,B00006IUKY,"As mentioned in other reviews, this type of movie has been done before.  What's new to me as someone who hasn't seen hungarian films before is the way it's done.  The plot was very simple and the dialogue often felt like you were listening in on a conversation at a cafe.  The story is largely carried by the actors who do a great job at being quirky.  It's hard to imagine someone better suited that Hamori at playing a spacey, innocent girl.  Kovacs(Moni) and Lengyel(Krisztian) and very competent.  Watch Kovacs eyes when she's looking at Hamori; it's hillarious.  Csanyi(Miki) was funny, too, especially with his eating disorder, but you have to see him in the DVD extra.  It's like he's off in his own world.  Either the interviewer played a joke on him or he's just intellectually crazy.

Finally, I have to say the music was really cool.  It matched the mood of the movie well and it has a style all its own.  When you watch this, don't expect something that might win at Cannes, although the ending did make my jaw drop.  Just enjoy the quirky actors and mood that it puts you in and you might like it.",1167609600,3,1110,4.462686567164179
8219974,4,B00006IUKY,"Despite the bad reviews given this film by some others here, I bought a copy anyway, expecting a boring, drab, poorly made ""slice-of-gritty-urban life-in-contemporary-Budapest"" film ... and was pleasantly surprised that the film did NOT meet my expectations!

""I Love Budapest"" is actually a rather sweet film, very well made, with memorable -- even subtle -- acting (yes, the characters are all incredibly dumb, but charming nonetheless).  What surprised me most was its fantastic/ambiguous ending that one can interpret as one likes.

I've been watching a number of Hungarian films lately, and actually this is one of my favorites. I was certainly NOT given good advice by the sour, negative reviews posted here, and just wanted to alert others to give this film a chance: yes, it's a conventional enough story (naive country girl goes to the big city, falls in with the ""wrong sort""), but the acting and ending are enough to make me want to keep it for repeat viewings -- and to practice my Hungarian!",1166486400,11,1004,4.964285714285714
8219975,1,B00006IUKY,"I'm half Hungarian, so I am always on the ""look-out"" for anything that will remind me of Hungary.  Therefore, I may tend to be more lenient than others when grading Hungarian movies or books...BUT even I can't save this horribly boring, stupid waste of your time ""movie"". First, if anyone has been to Hungary or Budapest, you'll see that they clearly don't show any of the places to which trendy Hungarian girls would go to party. I think that probably has to do with budget, i.e., they had to stay away from any recognizable monument/area, to keep the costs down.  SO, if you're goal is to visit/re-visit Budapest on film, you won't see any of it here.  The actors have silly lines (I felt sorry for them!) and the theme song is played over and over and over until you want to scream! And the end is absolutely ludicrous....I am almost ashamed that this is the kind of stuff that comes across international waters to represent Hungary.",1123200000,10,936,4.592814371257485
8219976,2,B00006IUKY,Probably this is one of the most boring movie I have seen for long time.  Badly shot and edited... what else can I say!!!  You should see it and learn from it... how not to make a movie like this.  This is not even an arty movie!!!,1090886400,5,231,3.872340425531915
