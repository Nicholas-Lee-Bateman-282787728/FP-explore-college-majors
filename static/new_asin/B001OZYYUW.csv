8331797,4,B001OZYYUW,"Bought this for my hubby to practice is french.. The dvd is a little slow but it is real nice. We read the questions together to practice his pronunciation, then try to understand, go over all the words together and explain meaning. It is perfect to pick up expressions. When it is questions about pop culture etc... we look it up on google and watch video/ biography of artists named. SUPER helpful!
A great addition to other ways to pick up on french!",1260835200,,453,4.469879518072289
