8053972,4,B0007Y8A5Q,"The product, price and delivery were all fantastic.  I cannot fault the supplier in any way.  Top notch.

The whole regional coding thing bugs me though.  I get that companies don't want movies or programmes available in countries that haven't had them released in theatres or on networks yet but where its a show that's had its time, what's the point?  If you're on the edge of the earth in region 4 and you buy this region 1 show, then your multi-region player will play it but it does something that distorts it and gives the flow of frames a jagged edge that wears on you after a while.  Still watchable though but not if you're fussy.",1123286400,2,639,4.418803418803419
8053973,5,B0007Y8A5Q,"I already knew the episodes were excellent, but all the extras that are contained on these dvd's are equally as superb.  This makes a terrific addition to my dvd collection!",1121126400,3,173,4.766666666666667
