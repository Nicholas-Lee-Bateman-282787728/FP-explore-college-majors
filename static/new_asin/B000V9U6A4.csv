8217634,5,B000V9U6A4,I used each of the 3 Retiever Fever CD's and followed them to the letter with my Yellow Lab starting as soon as we got him.  It took my dog training to a competition level. I highly recommend these training CD's.  I am about to start with another pup and can't wait to use them again.,1418601600,,284,4.053571428571429
8217635,2,B000V9U6A4,"We purchased the DVD as we are about to get a lab puppy (it had been years since my husband trained a puppy and wanted a refresher) and the information provided by the ""professional breeder"" was limited at best. For the price, it only offers a very basic overview, not the expected training information as indicated by the DVD description. I am sure there are better training videos out there that are worth the investment, but this one unfortunately is not worth the time or money to watch.",1357516800,,491,4.590909090909091
