415153,3,6302020816,"Germany's modern cinema is vastly evolving into a completely independent cinematic class of excellence. From superb production, independent historic interpretation and direction values,as shown in Der Untergang, to humor,nostalgia and pathos in Goodbye Lenin. No longer lagging behind and blindly imitating U.S cinema,it is not astounding that one of this years Oscar contenders in the category foreign film is a German production, also starring the brilliant Julia Jentsch. The Edukators contains many of the ingredients that make modern German cinema a creative and commercial success, yet it also lags on other aspects.

The plot revolves around two best friends, who are completely and idealisticly dedicated to the improvement of the world and fight against social injustice,confident that they have identified the villain. They elaborate a complex scenario by which they break into the villas of the wealthy upper class,simply deranging the furniture and leaving behind notes such as ""Your days of plenty are numbered"".These two friends,Jan(Daniel Br?hl)and Peter(Stipe Erceg),having written an elaborate list of target villas and guilty people, have no qualms about giving themselves rhe title of revolutionaries and the absolute guilt of the people they target. The situation becomes more complex when Peter goes to Spain for a few days, leaving his girlfriend Jule(Julia Jentsch) behind with Jan. The two soon become close friends and it is just a matter of time before Jan reveals to her what he and Peter do on their nightly journeys. Jule reveals to him in return that she is deeply indebted and that she will loose many years of her life in hard work, due to a minor accident and a beurocratic mishap. By coincidence the person responsible for her deep financial crisis, Mr. Hardenberg (Burghart Klau?ner),is on their list. They break into his Villa and wreak havoc on the interior. Escaping the ""crime scene"" unscathed,their euphoria is soon given a halt, when Jule realizes that she forgot her mobile telephone. As they go back to search for it,the situation escalates dramatically as Mr. Hardenberg surprisingly returns. Their desperate situation only becomes worse as they pull Peter into it and find themselves forced to kidnap the wealthy Mr. Hardenberg. Hiding in the mountain cabin of Jules Uncle, they become better acquainted with the man. He surprises the friends by telling them that he also was once idealistic and a member of the student revolutionary movement, but the duties of life, like his career and family, surpassed his ideals. Mr. Hardenberg professes admiration for their youthful idealism and the growing trust between him and them slowly begins to untie the knots of the conflict. Complicating the issue is Jules and Jan's growing attraction to each other, which threatens to separate the friends and irrevocably escalate the situation.

Director Weing?rtner never manages to convince us that the revolutionary talk Jan and Peter sprout is more then just youthful babble. Their conviction of moral superiority often appears more self righteous then factual. They accuse Mr.  Hardenberg of unfairly hoarding his money and not aiding the socially and economically disadvantaged,without even a hint of proof. It seems like their case of wanting to make revolution is not different from most revolutions, the revolutionaries rarely pass to think of what exactly they are revolting against. Though they are faced with the example of Mr. Hardenbergs level headed pragmatism and his nostalgia for gone bye ideals,there is very little self reflection of whether what they do is right or wrong, except for one scene in which Jan almost falters. It is also not very convincing why Mr. Hardenbergs sympathy would extend to actively supporting and collaborating in his kidnapping,which despite all good intentions is of course a crime. However,Director Weing?rtners does not leave any ambiguity as to which side he stands on. The final scene almost seems like an open call for serious vandalism. These weaknesses betray the movies self styled intellectualism. Has Jan's talk about social justice really convinced us so much so that we now openly consider international sabotage?

The film has all the good intentions and ingredients that make a classy movie, fine and dedicated actors, good camera work and a very ambitious director, yet never manages to make a clear and believable  statement, nor to convince us as to who is right and who is wrong. The character development is insufficient and at the end everyone is back to where they started. The film promises more then it can  offer, often taking itself far too seriously. The end result is nothing more and nothing less then a good film and hopefully a stepping stone for a talented and ambitious cast.",1141516800,6,4787,5.242819843342037
415154,4,6302020816,"The Edukators is a very interesting German film, directed by Hans Weingartner, about three young radicals whose ideals are put to the test. We at first observe them taking part in fairly commonplace demonstrations against global trade. These are people, however, who are determined to take things beyond the level of protest.  Jan and Peter are friends who break into the homes of affluent people and, instead of stealing anything, simply rearrange the furniture and other items. They leave a calling card with the message, ""Your days of plenty are numbered,"" and sign it ""The Edukators."" The premise is in itself fascinating and leads to some humorous scenes as well as provoking thought. The humor comes from seeing the absurd relocation of objects, such as putting a stereo in the refrigerator. This is, rather than conventional vandalism, a kind of performance art, meant to create uneasiness and self-examination on the part of the victims.

While Peter is out of town, his girlfriend Jule and Jan spend time together and become attracted to each other. After Jan introduces Jule to the Edukators' tactics, Jule convinces him to help her ""visit"" the home of a businessman to whom she owes a large sum of money following a car accident. The man catches them and they end up kidnapping him, bringing Peter into the action. The rest of the film follows the three friends as they decide what to do with their victim and debate politics with him. Some of these discussions are interesting, though they inevitably follow a predictable course (""you are a parasite living off the poor"" vs. ""I have a right to what I earned,"" to paraphrase). The businessman, however, moves from arguing with his captors to sympathizing with them, explaining that he was once a radical himself. Is this for real or merely a ploy to gain their trust? The romantic triangle further escalates the tension.

I liked the intellectual content of The Edukators; it reminds us of how few films today deal sympathetically with characters who are not only outside the system, but actively oppose it. Even better, the movie does not simply romanticize the radicals and demonize the businessman. It actually raises more questions than it answers, which is probably a good thing. It is not a perfect film; some of the situations seem a bit contrived (e.g. one of them is an expert at deactivating burglar alarms because he used to work for a security company).  The ending is more of a clever punchline than a serious resolution of matters. Still, it is very engaging and well-acted and puts a new face on the old dilemma of participating in vs. fighting mainstream society.",1139356800,16,2640,4.899328859060403
415155,4,6302020816,"Jan and Peter are two best friends who try to change the world by screwing with the minds of the wealthy. When the rich go on vacation, these two boys break into their homes and move stuff around. However, when Peter's girlfriend gets into the act for revenge, everythings goes horribly wrong and friendships begin to crack. Even though there is obviously some deeper meaning to this film, it is still interesting enough to keep viewers engaged. The acting is excellent, especially with Daniel Bruehl from 'Good-bye, Lenin!' as Jan. A must-see for everyone, whether you speak German or not.",1135209600,10,590,4.91
415156,5,6302020816,"'Die Fetten Jahre sind vorbei' or THE EDUKATORS has a message, a message that deals with the 'education' of the captains of industry by the idealistic socially conscious rebels among the youth AND the 'education' of those rebellious youths by the world wise/weary hoarders of wealth whose life change resulted from being the rebellious youth of yesteryear. The dichotomy of opinions makes for a thoughtful and thought-provoking diatribe that lifts this film from an action movie into the realm of a psychological 'thriller' of sorts.

Peter (Stipe Erceg) and Jan (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) have been close friends for fifteen years, share a flat, and spend their time attacking the corrupt society in which they resentfully find themselves by breaking in to wealthy peoples homes while the owners are away, rearranging all the furniture and leaving notes that inform them their days of lifestyle are doomed.  They do not steal or damage: their acts are political and philosophical statements.  Jan is the more idealistic of the two and also the more reclusive.  Peter is gregarious and finds a live-in girlfriend Jule (Julia Jentsch) who slowly becomes attracted to Jan, more for bonding than for Peter's physical emphasis.  Jule confesses to Jan that the reason she cannot accompany the good-hearted Peter on a trip to Spain is that she is deeply in debt, the result of an accident in her old car with a new Mercedes belonging to an older wealthy man Hardenburg (Burghart Klau&szlig;ner) who is making Jule pay him the 100,000 Euros the car cost him.  Jule is complying but is resentful that a man of wealth is so money conscious that he has overlooked the fact that his demands have made her life intolerable.  When Jule is informed of Peter's and Jan's night capers, she suggests the trio make Hardenburg's home their next ploy.  The result of a bluster, the trio is discovered by Hardenburg and they opt to kidnap him to prevent their going to jail.

Retreating to a country cabin the now 'quartet' slowly come to understand each other, with Hardenburg confessing that in his youth he too was a hippie and a member of a similarly socially conscious gang.  He reminisces and gains the trio's respect, is instrumental in revealing the fact the what he believes is a m&eacute;nage a trois is in reality a changing of partners for Jule, preferring Jan to Peter.  How this new information alters the plans of the kidnapping and its resolution is the climax of the film and accompanies some surprises best left to the individual viewer's enjoyment.

The actors are uniformly excellent:  Daniel Br&uuml;hl is rapidly growing into a very fine actor and Julia Jentsch is most assuredly a new actor to watch.  The film gets a bit long in the tooth for the static situation of the final half, but the impact of the ending rescues the story from any flaws it may have had. Director Hans Weingartner understands the fine line between message films and entertaining movies and succeeds briskly with this one.  THE EDUKATORS leaves us with food for thought no matter the age group - current rebels or aged rebels!  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, December 05",1133395200,9,3141,4.89622641509434

415236,3,6302020816,"This is a German film about 3 friends living in Berlin - Jule (Julia Jentsch), her boyfriend Peter (Stipe Erceg) and his best friend Jan (Daniel Brhl). Jule is struggling to pay off a big debt owing to a wealthy businessman and, bitter about her situation, is quick to see a possible way to get revenge when she learns that Peter and Jan break into rich homes, rearrange the furniture and leave political notes like ""the days of plenty are over""...
The first hour or so of the film is great. The tension mounts and there is a real sense of anticipated horror - you're just waiting for disaster to strike. However, after that, the film starts to get ever more unbelievable. You just find yourself asking ""would the characters really do that in this situation?"" It becomes too tinged with political overtones and the sense of realism disappears entirely for me.
So if you like German films, you should check out ""Good Bye Lenin!"" instead. Daniel Brhl also features in it and I found it a much better film than this one.",1393459200,,1017,4.562841530054645

Despite the commonplace themes of friendship, love, youthful idealism, and its basic plot structure (by the way, for your viewing pleasure, do NOT read a synopsis of the film, such as the back of the DVD case), I enjoyed the film immensely. I liked the camera style, the acting, and the drama. I do want to point out some things that I think could have been done better: the anti-capitalist arguments. In the film the three young idealists are the mouthpieces of some really cliche anti-capitalist rhetoric, and I found it unappealing and almost risible how these arguments ""turned"" Hardenberg. In this way, the films most prominent message, it seemes, falls flat. Thus the theme of youthful idealism is not done particularly well: the film should have sharpened the edges of moral ambivalence more, rather than relying on dull cliches. But nevertheless the film's other central themes (love and friendship) are portrayed beautifully.",1305417600,,954,5.082802547770701
415294,5,6302020816,"When the acknowledged Marshall Mac Luhan defined the TV as the modern babysitter, maybe he wasn't speculating at all.

And this piquant film seems to confirm the previous statement. When a successful executive of the media is fired and suffers an almost mortal car accident, he turns the whole round in order to investigate what's going on behind and beneath the real sources which feed the raw material of the survey.

So, he will plan a risky and daring effort in order to make the audiences much more exigent and demanding respect the quality of the TV programs, the acidic satire will emerge like an eruptive volcano. Admirable reflections and a more than well deserved in Fassbinder's memory make of this film one of the most memorable cult movies of this first decade.

It is a very ""european"", very German, specifically Berlin theme that may be somewhat difficult for the average American to grasp. The counter-culture scene in The US is very different from that which existed and continues to a lesser extent in the now re-unified City of Berlin. The movie takes many unexpected twists and turns and is a wonderful look into the world of the utopian ideals of three German youths when those ideals clash with the harsh reality and consequences of their actions. The result of their actions is a domino effect of one shocking experience after another. The movie ends in a wonderfully unexpected way that left me stunned.",1268870400,,785,4.865671641791045

Notwithstanding that small manifesto and its axiom,""Die Edukators"" gives us pause.  It asks us to conclude that cinema exists without its dominant, even post-Hollywood, ""independent,"" forms.

That is about as much as I can say in 2010, six years after this film was released. I'd offer, however . . .

415299,4,6302020816,"Are we faithful to our ideals, values, friends?  As many reviews note here, there is a political element to this film.  It's mostly about the excessive consumerism that drives Western capitalist economies and societies.  But there is also a very intense personal element.

In the beginning I found myself caring about the 3 main characters.  Later the tension mounts through the ambiguity of some nicely executed plot devices.  The enjoyment is not just the suspense of what will happen but of whether the characters will keep the faith in their ideals and their friends.  The unfolding process as the 3 sort out their choices is artfully done and sometimes with a sweet subtle touch.

I won't reveal much of the plot because other reviews do that extensively (although perhaps too much).  The ending was good.  One character makes a statement and from that the ending just flows to a natural conclusion.  The ambiguity stays intact however through to the final scene.  I thought it was pitch perfect even though a good deal of the device at the end has been used before.

The acting was wonderful.  I was delighted to see Julia Jentsch in this.  I saw her in ""I Served the King of England"" only a few months ago and enjoyed her performance in that also.

Amazon is offering this at $11 and I would happily pay that to have this in my film library.  However, this is a little off beat for the mass market in the US and one might be able to find a slightly pre-viewed copy at certain retailers for $4.  This is a film I know I will enjoy watching again - and soon.

I'm tempted to give it 5 stars, but there are a couple of slight flaws that bother me and there are no extra features.  I would have really enjoyed learning more about the locations.",1258588800,,1747,4.503184713375796

This movie hits you in a very subtle way, and you don't know what you think about it until the very end. In fairness, the movie also gives the progressive some things to chew on.

It's a little tough to buy the revolutionary enthusiasm the characters have, but then maybe that's the point. I consider the movie to be a little uneven because it seems to change its focus and bite throughout. The first part is about how two friends break into houses to rearrange furniture but not steal. It also covers the desperation of the girlfriend of one of them who is working to pay off a debt due to an uninsured auto accident. This part comes to a climax when the other friend and the girl have bonded but get caught in the house of the man she owes money to. The tempo then switches to a kidnapping scenario in which they take the guy a mountain retreat and spend a lot of time talking, even finding out the rich guy was once a revolutionary himself. Finally in the end, just when it seems like everyone has changed their ways, everything goes back to the way it was. The last image is a note found by the police in their apartment saying ""Some men never change.""

Peter's girlfriend Jule (Julia Jentsch) has her own reasons for being angry with the ridiculously wealthy: she's perpetually broke, slowly paying a man named Hardenberg (Burghart Klauner) the cost of a high-end Mercedes from an accident when she didn't have insurance. At her low-wage job, it'll be years before she pays it off.

When Peter's out of town, she and Jan spend time together, getting closer, and Jan tells her about The Edukators. Jule convinces Jan that her nemesis is the perfect subject for the scheme. However, while they're rearranging his house, Hardenberg returns home, catches them, and recognizes Jule.

Panicking, they take him hostage, and then call Peter to come rescue them, and they all end up in a secluded cabin in the mountains while they think about their options.

I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie that seemed to promise to be a sociopolitical drama, but after the first 20 minutes or so, I was hooked. It did make me think--a lot--about social problems, but it was the characters that grabbed me.

The young trio were very realistically frustrated, both with the injustices they saw and with their inability to effect change. And yet, they're just playing at being revolutionaries--their big statements are a cross between a prank and performance art. The romantic triangle was also very well done, and played into their motivations--specifically, the different relationships between Jan and Jule and Peter and Jule, and between Jan and Peter were distinct and the events in the film changed those relationships.

Hardenberg was even more thought-provoking, as he reveals his history as a 60s radical himself, and his journey into becoming one of the ultra-rich.

Probably not coincidentally, it was also around the 20-minute mark that I started ignoring the subtitles and just listening to the dialogue in German. There's a huge difference for me in being able to understand a movie when it's originally in German as opposed to being dubbed. Lots more syllables in German than in English, so the actors in dubbed movies talk really fast--not so good for the less-than-fluent.",1214438400,4,2410,5.055415617128464

Young woman's life and future are ruined because she owes 100,000 euro debt to a rich man whose Mercedes she has damaged during car accident while she had no insurance and registration.  Her aggression and pain are silent but one can tell that she is close to the tipping point.

415365,5,6302020816,"On the back of the DVD cover it says that it was one of the funniest movies that person had seen all year. That I would disagree with, because I found it anything but funny. However it is a great movie. It really captures this feeling of powerlessness and of hopelessness that one finds in German youth and young adults. Although I am sure the same goes for Americans. All three main characters work, because they have to, but aren't exactly sure where it will ever get them. They start breaking into houses-huge, rich villas-, not to steal anything, but to rearrange furniture and take away that feeling of security from the rich. The feeling of security is something they haven't experienced yet in their adult lives. Jule owes a lot of money to a filthy rich guy, because she hit his mercedes and was uninsured. All she works for, is to pay him back. On her insistance they break into his house and end up getting caught by him. In a rush moment they abduct him and go to this hut in the mountains. There begins a conversation between the three and the captured. He, although now wealthy, claims to have been quite active in the 60s and 70s and that he understands what's going on him them. It becames an interesting dialogue, but it's not idealized, because Jule's and Peter's position is brought into question as well, because violence doesn't solve anything. The movie never really gives an answer to what the solution for the future is, but it discribes this present state of mind perfectly and states that something has to change, better sooner than later.

415369,5,6302020816,"Since I entered this film with no expectations, The Edukators hit me like a combination of a spiked punch and a sucker punch - it left me surprisingly shaken yet somehow also refreshingly, intoxicatingly awakened.

The Edukators takes us on a journey with three would-be revolutionaries: Jan, a passionate iconoclast who rails against the commodification of dissent (""What used to be revolutionary, you can buy in stores today.  Che Guevara t-shirts and anarchy stickers.""); Jule (played by Julia Jentsch, the dazzling young actress from ""Sophie Scholl""), a directionless and searching soul who, as Jan says, goes to so many protests against exploitation and oppression but is still oppressed and exploited herself; and Peter, an somewhat nave idealist who early on tells Jule to ""always go for the brightest colors"" when choosing an ice cream flavor.

Apparently, writer/director Hans Weingartner took these latter words to heart in the making of this movie; it's been ages since I've seen such vivid, vibrant hues in a film - from the chaotic neon of the boisterous Berlin cityscape to the pastoral calm of the countryside, this movie is awash in breathtaking color.

The same could also be said about its characters - though they may start of as seemingly one-dimensional archetypes, many shades of light and dark emerge from each well-acted portrait.  And when complications arise in the young revolutionaries' activities (as they always do, when one puts one's dreams into action), they end up on opposite sides of a standoff in which some remarkable similarities are discovered.

The Edukators deftly mixes politics of the mind with politics of the heart and whips it all into a heady and suspenseful stew.  (And no small amount of suspense was created by my own worries, as the film neared its conclusion, that there was no way to end it in a satisfactory way - happily, I was wrong!).

And while the DVD lacks any real extras, with 2 hours and 10 minutes of such satisfying and sumptuous cinematic goodness, can you really bite off any more when you're already so full?!",1168300800,10,2078,5.0028985507246375

There are lots of gloomy shots of the various characters brooding with vague looks on their faces.  Two of the kidnappers are male, one is female.  Of course there's a love triangle.  They drink quite a bit and smoke some pot.  Eventually they decide to let the guy go since they aren't the killing types.  There's a silly little twist at the end that is good for a laugh.

415371,4,6302020816,"I generally hate rom-coms.  Occasionally though, watching two people falling in love and expressing it in a very simple way just gets through and wins my heart. For me, The Edukators works on the same level. It is a film which allows important ideas about the politics in our lives to be conveyed in a very simple way. And I see this as a great strength. Too often, complexity and overanalysis can dull us to a concept we fundamentally believe in and give us the excuse to deny its power. I'd be interested to ask those who complain that the politics here are too stripped down and ""text-book"" when they actually last heard sypathetic characters with such pure ideology given a voice and the chance to chase down their beliefs in a big screen drama, in front of the world, as opposed to in the campus bar.  We don't resist the simplicity of ""I love you"".  Yet what could be more complex than love?  I enjoyed the rush of spending time with characters who say ""I believe I can change things"" and are allowed to have a go at doing just that.",1152921600,4,1039,4.395833333333333
415372,4,6302020816,"Peter (Stipe Erceg) and Jan (Daniel Bruhl) are ""The Edukators"", young men with leftish political ideas that have their own way of fighting the establishment. What do they do? Well, they break into rich people s houses and rearrange the furniture in strange ways, leaving behind a card signed saying ""Your days of plenty are numbered"", signed by ""The Edukators"". The purpose of Peter and Jan is to scare the rich, and make them realize that not everybody is happy with the status quo.

All goes well until Jule (Julia Jentsch), Peter s girlfriend, learns about their activities from Jan, while Peter is on holidays. Jules likes what they do, and proposes Jan to break into the house of a rich businessman that ""ruined her life"". Of course, not everything goes well, but that makes things more interesting, as their unsuccessful mission spices the rest of the movie, setting the stage for a kidnapping and a love triangle  :)

All in all, I can say that I really liked this movie. ""The Educators"" is not realistic and it is far from perfect, but it certainly is quite original and entertaining. Furthermore, this film has some good dialogue that will make you think about rebellion, and change. Of course, recommended.

415373,1,6302020816,"I really enjoyed Goodbye Lenin, and it was mostly on the basis of seeing thatm film that I decided to watch this one. The film follows three idealistic, politically right-on young people rebelling against what they see as unthinking, selfish and uncaring Bourgeois consumer society. This rebellion takes the form of breaking into rich peoples houses, moving their furniture around, and leaving notes like 'You are too wealthy' - very situationist (never mind the fact that this point is probably largely lost on the rich people they break into).
All this is fine and well, but the problem with the film is that on the one hand it glamourises these young people, and on the other paints every single other person in the film as some rich, ignorant Bourgeois pig. In the first ten minutes or so, I thought this might be a clever bit of directing, in which we view society as seen through their eyes, rather than society in its reality. However, this wasn't to be the case. The world remained Bourgeois, the kids are alright. The older generation Bourgeoise are bare cyphers, and none (with the exception of the man they kidnap) is given anything like a personality. When a break-in goes wrong and they have to kidnap the rich man who lives there, and take him away to a shack in the hills. During this time, they decide to 'educate' him about the wrongs of the world and the rich man's part in them. The rich man barely challenges the young people at all, and accepts much of what he has done is probably wrong.

The anti-capitalist argument running through the entire film is very one-sided. I could appreciate the film a little bit more if it was balanced, but this wasn't. Furthermore, there are all the usual cliches associated with this type of work - the Edukators are young, good-looking and artistic - the subtext being that because they are arty, they can see things that others can't. At one point, one of the characters is on a bus when three men (presumably police, though its not made clear) hassle a drunk for not having a ticket. The character angrily bursts in and tells them to leave the drunk alone, gives the drunk his ticket, and gets off the bus. Do drunks even get hassled on buses by gangs of police? Can't say that's my experience - amybe they do in Germany. This is a recurring problem with the film - situations designed to show the main characters in a good light are contrived and unrealstic.

The anarchist/marxist/anti-capitalist dialouge the characters preach is so generic that it actually ends up being meaningless - by the end of the film you don't actually know what exactly they stand for, or what their solutions are to the problems of society. Basically, the one-sided political argument hamstrings the characters development. Their views are never challenged, so they don't change. It is left to the kidnapping and love triangle to create the conflict in the film. The ending is also unbeleivably cynical, and completely undoes any idealism that had been generated in the course of the film.

Generally, it feels like a script written by a 1st year politics student, being so utterly simplistic in it's 'the Rich are all bad' message. I would recommend this to anyone who is 17 years old and angry at society, but at the same time I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wanted some insight into how we should solve the world's problems.

There has been a rash of good political films lately - Good Night and Good Luck, Syriana, The Constant Gardener. Unfortunately, and given so much potential, this film is not one of them. Shame.",1144281600,24,3567,4.7024
