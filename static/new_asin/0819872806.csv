7793014,5,0819872806,"This dvd was EXACTLY what I was looking for !  It tells 10 parables in 4 minute segments so that after each parable you can pause and talk about what happened in the parable and how it applies to our life.  It does not wind children up with lots of action.  It tells the story calmly but very understandably with good graphics and calm music.  I would put it geared to K-4th grade.  I think it is well done, and did keep my children's attention!",1431216000,2,445,4.188235294117647
