8752758,5,B01CDW4FXA,"This is a nice sleek pair of sunglasses. They are very lightweight, and my husband and I can both wear them comfortably. I had never worn polarized sunglasses before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I did not really notice much difference when I wore the sunglasses than when I wear regular ones, but when I take them off and look at the inside of the lenses, they look blue whereas the outside of the lenses look like normal sunglasses lenses. When I received the sunglasses, though, there was an item included that when I looked at it while wearing the sunglasses, a picture appeared.

In addition to the sunglasses, there is a nice black sturdy case to store the sunglasses. There is also a white soft cloth to use to clean the sunglasses, and there is a soft brown bag with a drawstring as an alternative carrying case.

*I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review. I was not paid to review this product nor was I obligated to leave a review.  My opinion is my own and based on my experience after trying the product.",1470268800,,1040,4.43455497382199
