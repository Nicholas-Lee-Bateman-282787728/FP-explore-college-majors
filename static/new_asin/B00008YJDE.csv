7987936,2,B00008YJDE,"The audio drops out in chapter 5 and does not return for the remainder of this rather good movie.  Although one critic suggested he had success playing this DVD in another of his players, I tried the disc in my 3 DVD players, including my all region player and my Blu Ray player, but none could play the audio beyond where it dropped out.",1367452800,,338,4.28125
7987937,1,B00008YJDE,"How can a company take a great product and turn it into garbage?  Well Facets Video issued this splendid DVD with audio that does not work past chapter 6.  I tried it on several players.  I spoke to Cris at Facets, 800 331-6197 and they are aware of the problem but do not seem to care.  Be careful in buying any of their products,",1069977600,7,331,4.125
7987938,2,B00008YJDE,"this is a great film about a upper class family in italy during the waning years of world war two. I will not delve to far into the plot, etc. due to the fact that this DVD seems to be a low quality dupe of the film, rather than a studio release. while it is a clean transfer the contrast is not as good as it should be. the worst factor is that on two of my three DVDs ( a sony and a philips) players the sound is NOT AUDIBLE after chapter 6. only one of my DVD players (a panasonic) can play the sound all the way through. beware. I would wait to see another release by a major sutdio before investing in a DVD of this truely great film.",1056758400,9,639,3.8484848484848486
