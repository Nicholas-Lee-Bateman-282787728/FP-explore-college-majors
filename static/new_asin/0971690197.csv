7794413,1,0971690197,"I bought this video because I believed it would be chair work along with weight training.  When she uses weights, she goes much too fast--no one should be pumping weights at triple time (especially overhead) unless they are really young and healthy.  Paper plates can be used instead, but the exercisers using the paper plates look just too stupid for words.  And you end up doing the same motions over and over and over.  Lots and lots of just moving your feet up and down and waving paper plates.  Lack of imagination in choreography.  The instructor is not good--no cues until she has already moved into the next motion.  Also, she is standing and she does not tell the sitting exercisers how to adapt.  In other words, the chair work gets short shrift.  I wish the DVD had been defective so I could get my money back.",1523318400,,821,4.530612244897959

However, it served the purpose with getting the heart rate up and enjoying physical stimulation .",1521763200,,228,4.325581395348837

7794419,5,0971690197,Absolutely Positively the BEST exercise video for seniors.  You can sti - stand - do it fast - do it slow.  It's your pace.  I was introduced to this video at my primary care health pavilion and I kind of poo-pooed the concept of chair dancing but boy was I wrong.  This is a workout that I can do plus it lets you work up a sweat if you let it.  I'm so impressed.,1508025600,2,364,3.864864864864865
