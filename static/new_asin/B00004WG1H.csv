7925114,3,B00004WG1H,I've watched documentaries with more drama and tension than this flick.  The story line was interesting enough Though a bit anti climactic.  I was kind of rooting for the construction worker - no surprise she went with her fellow narcissistic actor.  The plot managed to keep me interested but the acting and directing didn't do it justice.  I struggled to stay awake through the whole thing.,1461110400,,392,4.893939393939394
7925115,1,B00004WG1H,"Sorry, didn't finish watching this movie.  It was  little boring for me. Very slow start.",1443657600,,89,4.866666666666666
7925116,3,B00004WG1H,Okay. So.. Will Arnett is great and pretty much drags the entire movie across the finish line.  It was by no means the worst movie I've ever seen but it wasn't all that great.  It has some endearing moments and  it is somewhat humorous.,1436400000,,236,4.318181818181818
7925117,1,B00004WG1H,"Felt like Cliff Notes. Fun to see Will Arnett (and that moment when you see someone who absolutely HAS to be related to a Lawford), but the acting was pretty bad all around.  The most convincing acting was the annoying diner and the cockroach who isn't even shown on screen. Nobody to like, nobody to hate, reminisce over the Twin Towers shot.",1413676800,,343,4.532258064516129
7925118,1,B00004WG1H,"Not my cup of tea. Too much blah, blah and blah.",1410480000,,48,3.4545454545454546
7925119,4,B00004WG1H,"I usually hate movies about actors and how interesting they are. They aren't at all. However, this little indie film is well written, and the subject just happens to be journeymen actors and their quest for success as they toil away as waiters and bartenders. The characters are all stereotypes, but the one who does the pretentious one man show is pretty funny, especially when he tells off two casting people, one of whom is Chris Lawford, the Kennedy cousin. Very watchable.",1267920000,,477,4.829268292682927
7925120,5,B00004WG1H,This is a terrific movie to rent and watch and spend a fun evenig with a friend.  The story keeps moving and has plenty of hilarity to keep you interested throughout.  The advertising accurately describes it as a cross between Friends and Sex in the City.  Neither to serious or to light its the perfect entertainment.,989712000,3,318,4.642857142857143
7925121,5,B00004WG1H,"One viewing of this hilarious movie will convince you the name Ken Liotti is one to watch.  His insightful vignettes of contemporary artists-in-waiting splays across the screen the bold colors of desperation, decadence, and the undaunted pursuit of a dream.  Ken's mastery of colloquial New York-ese draws laughter and - at times - disturbing introspection from the audience.  His hard-line realism in depicting the grunge and garishness of these aspiring artists' world transports the viewer directly into their midst.  This man's days among independent filmmakers are numbered...watch for this boy in Hollywood!",972345600,3,613,5.630434782608695
