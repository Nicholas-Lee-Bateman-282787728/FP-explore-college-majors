8483731,5,B000NKBMI6,"This was shot in August 2004 and is one of the all time best ROH Straight Shootin' DVD's. The 2 disc DVD set covers Foley's career from 2001 thru his 2004 fued with Randy Orton. The entire 2nd disc features Foley responding to everything Ric Flair wrote about him in Flair's book ""To Be The Man"", which is the most interesting part of this shoot interview. A highly recommended purchase if you're a hardcore Foley fan.",1409616000,,418,4.5131578947368425
8483732,2,B000NKBMI6,"A brief review. It's pretty dated, of course. He talks a lot about what Flair said in his book, and harps on it for pretty much the entire shoot. I stopped liking Foley (legit) after he turned heel in 2006. I don't know, I just never had a reason to like him after that. So maybe I'm biased. I just don't find his schtick cute anymore, so I really didn't like this shoot. But for ardent Foley fans, they'll really enjoy more for what he has to say, even if you've probably heard it many many times before.",1276128000,,505,4.163265306122449
