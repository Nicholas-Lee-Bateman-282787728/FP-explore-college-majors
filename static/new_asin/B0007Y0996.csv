2250630,5,B0007Y0996,"The 3rd series of  League of Gents is one of the best if viewed from the overall arch of the 6 stories tied together with an Amores Perros-like moment. It think it's correct, as other reviewers have noted, that this series is made up of short films, and as such, it works brilliantly.

While this series is more story driven than the two previous, I think this really elevates this series from other Brit Coms. Take Little Britain, which is entirely character-driven, for comparison and you know that you have something really special (and also very depraved).

I do see why some Gents fans would not like this series. They ""kill off' two of the best characters Edward & Tubbs at the beginning of the first episode. Now that takes real balls.  But It prevents this show from turning into the worst parts of Little Britain (predictable characters that become less humorous with more appearances).

The Gents takes their characters to new highs (or lows) and there are some truly shockingly funny scenes.",1165276800,,1002,4.76878612716763
2250631,3,B0007Y0996,"The League of Gentlemen peaked early and they peaked high.  There was really no room for improvement following the stellar first season of this hilarious show.  The show took a turn away from it's roots in the second season and, by the third it had strayed very far afield.

Season three is very inconsistent, with some episodes such as ""The Lesbian and the Monkey"" being absolutely hilarious.  Others, such as ""How the Elephant Got It's Trunk,"" are not only not funny, but stupid as well.  In between are some episodes which aren't terribly good, but aren't terribly bad either. In the end it's just hard to get away from the abysmal ""Elephant"" episode, which is just painful to watch.  Really Season three deserves two and one half stars, but that isn't an option.",1122940800,2,766,4.7218045112781954
2250632,5,B0007Y0996,"The first two series of The League of Gentlemen are a wonderful mixture of sketch comedy and soap opera, with elements of horror and drama. Series 3 is even better. The phenomenally talented Gentlemen take their bizarre formula to its zenith here, producing what in essence are 6 brilliant short films that all climax with a different perspective on the same event. I was floored by these shows - their originality, inventiveness, grotesque hilarity, and surprising moments of poignancy. The portrayal of characters goes way beyond the sort of one-dimensional caricature you normally associate with TV comedy. The residents of Royston Vasey, no matter how strange, feel vibrantly, believably real. This is a testament to the incredible acting talent of Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss, and Steve Pemberton, who, along with Jeremy Dyson, also write this unique program. Quite exhilerating, in its occasionally sickening way.",1120521600,2,921,5.402777777777778
2250633,5,B0007Y0996,"The first two series of ""The League of Gentlemen"" were fantastic, but it's the third that elevates the show into cult history. The bloody, demented sitcom is now a series of six short films, all linked together by the fatal car accident that ends each episode.

The third series sees the return of fan favorites like Pauline, the monstrous restart officer with a passion for pens; Geoff Tipps, the squat, gun-toting businessman with the world's shortest fuse; Charlie and Stella, a bitter, bickering couple with an invisible daughter, Julie; and even Papa Lazarou, one of television's scariest villians, who kidnaps local women and forces them to travel with him as part of his sideshow. We're also introduced to new characters like aspiring magician Dean Tavalouris, Dr. Carlton, a physician who loves child's party games, and Keith Drop, the Charity Shop's new clerk with a sinister secret. Car bombs and kidnappings, a prosthetic arm with a mind of its own, beauty pagaents, an invincible car called Maxie Power- the third series of ""The League of Gentlemen"" is darker, sicker, more twisted than the two that came before. Highly recommended for fans of black humor.",1120435200,3,1168,5.051813471502591
2250634,1,B0007Y0996,I am not going to make this a long review as i can't see the point. I live in the uk and am a massive League of Gentelmen fan however season 3 is just not the same and in my opinion it's not even worth watching. And for any fan of the show i will describe season 3 with just one line(It's just not local),1118361600,,304,3.6923076923076925
2250635,5,B0007Y0996,"For many fans, the third series is one that you'll LOVE or HATE.  Personally, I loved it.

The biggest changes are 1) the elimination of the laugh track (thank god!!) and 2) the featuring of one or two characters per episode.  The 3rd series is quite dark, but ties in together very nicely at the end of the series.

If you are a fan of the first two series, check this one out....be prepared to be disappointed.  But, if you're like me, be prepared to be AMAZED!!!",1114992000,4,465,4.2988505747126435

8053793,1,B0007Y0996,Big fan of the show but this season is notorious for being divisive amongst fans of the show. The comedy is non existent. Its like they changed the genre completely to a more serious and gritty but it just doesn't work. Instead it just comes of as dull and cold. Just ignore season 3 and stick with season 1 and 2 which are classics in dark comedy.,1423785600,,348,4.208955223880597

8053795,5,B0007Y0996,"You don't need to be Local to enjoy this series ! This was another over the top, extreme humor, risque suggestive scenes, and weird circumstances. It was brillant ! Totally funny and entertaining. Disc I was perfect, however, I never actually watched Disc 2 as was too much about the filming and rather slow. I would have preferred that it just be a continuation of the skits. Nevertheless, I was pleased and did enjoy the series. As an American, British TV is a bit new to me so I have relied on the reviews of others to select DVD's, The League of Gentleman was recommended by most and had excellent reviews. I can only endorse the laudatory reviews and comments and say that I enjoyed a bit of ""different"" humor and over the top comedy. Well Done !",1415059200,,751,4.449275362318841
8053796,1,B0007Y0996,"Thought this might be fun like the other show (I can't think of the name right now) with the asylum, but it turned out to be really crass and gross. Not funny at all :/",1394409600,,168,3.8285714285714287
8053797,3,B0007Y0996,"Season 1 was quite funny, season 2 built upon that, but season 3 seems to have missed a beat somewhere.

They changed the opening theme music for this season, and it's not nearly as 'atmospheric' as the original theme. They also changed the entire structure of the story-telling format ... instead of each episode containing multiple skits showing different characters, in this season each episode follows one character / character set for the entire episode.  Many of the skits were still fairly funny, but unfortunately the best running skit from previous seasons (the Local Shop) ends in the first episode. We are introduced to another really really weird character (Papa Lazarous) but they don't explore him & his back-story nearly enough.

Overall I felt this season was simply not as funny ... they clearly put more time & effort into character development (having a whole episode to work with rather than a 10 minute sketch will do that for you), but in my view that took away from the overall humor and feel of the program rather than enhanced the stories being told.

Even as such, it was still worth watching.

From across all 3 seasons, here's my thoughts:

Really Really Funny: Edward and Tubbs from the Local Shop (""What's all this shouting about, we'll have no trouble here!"", ""You heard the man Tubbs ... get undressed""), old ladies at the charity shop, Harvey the toad guy, Chinnery the vetrinarian

Just Not Funny:  chavs at the video store, the washed up one-hit-wonder, Legz Akimbo, Herr Lipp, Charlie and Stella the arguing couple, the magazine stand proprieters

Other characters or story lines are pretty much in the middle ... sometimes a bit boring or tedious with a few bright spots and occasional laughs.",1379980800,,1730,4.897260273972603
