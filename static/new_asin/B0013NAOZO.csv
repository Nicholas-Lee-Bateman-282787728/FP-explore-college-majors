8252396,5,B0013NAOZO,I liked the movie. Finally a movie with a message. Usually these movies are all the same. I thought it was  great to enlighten people about the pressures artists are under with some record labels. I appreciate the female FBI agent. I would also like to thank everyone for not putting a bunch of naked women in the movie. It shows real class. The acting of Dawued Saleh was great. He was really  funny too. Plus he's a cutie. I will definitely look out for his next movie. I wish him much success in this business.,1277942400,,513,4.333333333333333
8252397,5,B0013NAOZO,"I thought the story line was right on.  The movie flowed very smooth due to it having something to actually say.  It had a very nice mix of comedy, action and drama which will keep a wide variety of people intrigued.  So put the DVD in and sit back with a drink and some popcorn because you are if for a wild ride!  I have no doubt that the next films from Corey Grant will be blockbuster hits where people will be standing in line waiting for a ticket to see them on the BIG screen.",1210291200,,483,4.0
8252398,5,B0013NAOZO,"This is a classic hood flick.  The story is entertaining, the direction is quite good, and Geonard F. Butler's performance is brilliant.  There is a good balance here between drama and comedy.  It's no Goodfellas, but it's great for what it is: a classic hood flick.",1209686400,,266,4.739130434782608
