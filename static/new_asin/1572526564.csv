189508,5,1572526564,"I may shed a tear every now and then during a dramatic movie scene, but this film really kept the tears flowing... I'm torn between recommending this movie and protecting people from seeing it because it's so sad.
I've read many critics rip up this movie, also claiming Kevin Bacon's performance as being inconsistent, or perfunctory.  All I have to say to that is they were watching KEVIN BACON PLAY A DISABLED PERSON, and did not accept the character for who he was and let the story roll.  I'm sure if DiCaprio played Arnie in Gilbert Grape today after his established fame people would be more critical and see him as the known actor.
This slice-of-life picture may seem slow at times, but it adds to the realism of a non-Hollywood blockbuster that tries to cram everything down your throat.  It has a simple calmness to it, a child-like aura.  And speaking of children, Evan Rachel Wood's performance is solid, believable and promises an incredible acting career for her future.  She was a great casting call; not an over-dramatized, rag-dressed victim, but a believable 10-year-old in a small American town.
This movie captures the innocent friendship that can exist between an adult and a child, much like Mel Gibson's ""Man without a face,"" as his character was accused and judged for spending time with his student.  ""Digging to China"" will always remain a small film with dust on the sleeve at the video rental store, but I think it surpasses many Hollywood blockbusters that explode special effects and violence for the viewing public that just screams for more.  Some may compare Bacon's character (Ricky) to Hoffman's in ""Rain Man,"" but my heart goes out to Ricky in ""Digging to China,"" for he was conscious of his problem, and was hoping for a miracle.",983232000,37,1765,4.805280528052806
189509,4,1572526564,"""You're going to grow up and I'm not.""
This is what Ricky Schroth (Kevin Bacon) says to Harriet Frankovitz (Evan Rachel Wood) near the end of the film, expressing both the promise of her life, and the tragedy of his.  It is precisely because of the potential of this sharp spoken, sharp witted, beautiful little girl with a mind of her own that we are mesmerized by her, as we are by our own children, and why we are so deeply saddened by the young man who is not a man and never will be.
This is a film that discovers itself after a clumsy start and develops until at the end we see the beauty and the tragedy of its story as an affirmation of life.  Kevin Bacon starts awkwardly and has to work hard to conquer a demanding role.  But so does Wood, who in the beginning at times seemed unsure of who she is and how she should feel and react.  But both actors grow into their characters and become stronger and stronger as the film progresses.  However, I think Director Timothy Hutton (Best Supporting Actor for Ordinary People in 1980) might have profited by re-shooting some of the earlier scenes.
It is interesting to compare Bacon's performance with that of other actors who have attempted to play mentally retarded or mentally challenged characters--I'm thinking here of Dustin Hoffman in The Rain Man (1988) and Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade (1996).  Dustin Hoffman was of course something close to brilliant in his Academy Award winning role.  He had a charming script, and because he played alongside Tom Cruise he benefitted from not having to carry the picture by himself.  This was not the case for Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade, where too much was attempted without enough help so that Thornton ended up too much in front of the camera, and that was not always to his benefit.  Here Bacon is wonderfully supported not only by Miss Wood, but by Mary Stuart Masterson who plays Harriet's ""sister"" Gwen.  Some people have criticized Masterson's performance, but I think they are reacting to her non-sympathetic character, a woman, who, as Harriet says, ""should have been a nurse.  She's always making some guy feel better.""  I think Masterson was very subtle in a unrefined role, and touching as a woman who had a lot to learn.  Also excellent and completely believable in a limited role was Marian Seldes as Ricky's mother.
I was surprised that such an original and deeply lived script was not adapted from a novel.  No writer could have just dreamed up this story.  It had to have been lived in some sense.  (Part of it was dreamed up of course.)  So I guess, Karen Janszen, who wrote the script must have lived it.  At any rate, she is to be commended for such an original conception.  The setting in North Carolina at a rural motel (""Mom won it in a divorce""), and the three who ran ""Mac's Indian Cabins"" was perfect for the tale.  Her celebration of the spirit of a ten-year-old who thinks she can dig to China was precious and warm.  Some of the lines were so perfect.  I am thinking of Harriet's voice over after it is revealed that she and Ricky ""got married"" (baptized is more like it!).  The ten-year-old says, ""Gwen was mostly upset cause I got married before her.""",983059200,6,3194,4.555166374781086

Like other people say this movie will make you laugh but in some instances the movie is so sad, specially when he's about to leave town and he hug Harriet and after that the sister came and later on they take him to the jail and he keeps saying Im sorry.  Wow.  So sad.  Kevin Bacon did a great performance",1381968000,,407,4.10126582278481

189536,4,1572526564,I was very impressed by this movie. Kevin Bacon played his difficult part perfectly (as he always does in every role he chooses). If it weren't for his talent and ability the whole thing could have gone terribly wrong. Instead it went wonderfully right. Mary Stuart Masterson and Rachel Evan Wood are outstandingly talented too! The story had humor and pathos plus a feeling of authenticity that drew me into it. It's an excellent movie to add to a collection.,1341187200,,460,4.7625
189537,3,1572526564,"I had a difficult time taking this movie seriously after the girl drops her piggy bank in the river, immediately followed by Kevin Bacon's name in the opening credits. Pigs, bacon, eh...

Young Harriet (Evan Rachel Wood) meets ""born blue"" Ricky (Kevin Bacon) at a motel owned by Harriet's alcoholic single mom. Together they're ""one big sad monster."" Harriet wishes for something magical to happen, and for her mother to get well. Ricky wishes he could stay where he is, that his mom could live forever, and that he was as smart as everybody else. Harriet says she can grant him the last wish.

Near the end of the movie, before he's arrested, Ricky starts crying and tells Harriet that he is sad because, although Harriet wants him now, he will stay the same; she will grow up and won't want him later, which reminded me of the scene in Paris, Texas when Travis tells the story about tying Jane to a stove; also reminded me of a conversation I had with my thirty-five year old girlfriend a few years ago.

So, Digging to China.

189538,5,1572526564,This is a very good movie.  Kevin Bacon is superb in this role.  A real tear jerker movie.  Highly recommended.,1287360000,,111,4.45

189540,5,1572526564,"I don't understand why Kevin Bacon does not have an Oscar. It is unbelievable! The range of characters he plays is amazing. He doesn't play a slightly different version of himself in his movies, he becomes the character and takes you there with him. This is a beautiful and sensitive portrayal of a mentally challenged young man and what life is like for him.",1246233600,,359,4.625
189541,5,1572526564,"I had never heard of this film and only pulled it off the library shelf because of Kevin Bacon, who always does a good job.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see how good it is.  The story is fairly simple--about a mentally challenged young man who is being taken to a home because his mother is dying of cancer.  Their car breaks down near a motel which is run by an aging beauty who has given in to alchol, her adult daughter and a 10 year old girl.  I won't spoil it by telling you what happens, but I do advise anyone who likes old-fashioned, human interest stories to give this a try.

Timothy Hutton does a good job in his directorial debut, avoiding what could have been a terribly bathos-ridden mess.  He must have a good way with actors because the cast was uniformly wonderful here.  The ""mom"" and older daughter could have been shown as one dimensional characters--sort of trailer trash types.  But in spite of what are their obvious flaws, they show genuine love for the youngest girl and the transformation of the older daughter is very beautifully shown.

Kevin Bacon did a terrific job in playing the mentally disabled young man.  After about five minutes I forgot it was Kevin Bacon and was thorougly immersed in the character.  It must be very challenging to play such a role without falling into stereotypical gestures and he rose to the challenge.  The scene in which he tells the young girl that she will grow up and he never will is one of the most moving I've seen in a while.

Evan Rachel Wood gives a pitch perfect performance as the  tough-tender young girl.  I am reminded of Dakota Fanning's similar role in The Secret Life of Bees, which is also beautifully done. Mary Stuart Masterson is just right as the older daughter.  The woman who plays the dying mother who must give her son over to an institution is remarkable ('wish I could remember her name).  You can feel every pain she must be experiencing even as she underplays it.

I don't know why this film wasn't more popular when it came out. It is certainly well done and well worth watching.",1238630400,,2078,4.496
189542,5,1572526564,"This is an outstanding movie, full of laughter and tears. I had looked at all the movie stores around where I live and could not find it anywhere. My daughter suggested I look on Amazon and she was right!",1238630400,,204,4.256410256410256
189558,2,1572526564,"This movie is flat out terrible.  While the premise of a ""young girl forming an unlikely friendship with a mentally challenged man-child"" sounds great on paper, the execution is awful, right down to the cheesy ""in awhile crocodile"" catchphrase.  Kevin Bacon's research into the role apparently involved watching lots of Pee-Wee's Playhouse reruns.

The only bright spot in this movie is Mary Stuart Masterson, who does a more than serviceable turn as Bacon's troubled guardian/sister.",1193616000,,484,5.426666666666667
189559,5,1572526564,Kevin Bacon outdid himself in this performance.  Wonderful storyline and thought provoking subject matter.  Thoroughly enjoyable.,1168300800,,129,7.0
189560,5,1572526564,"I happened upon this excellent film on IFC and then bought a copy--seems to be a habit of mine. So I saw only the last half of the movie and then had to go back and watch the whole thing. What surprised me the most was Kevin Bacon--I actually didn't realize that he was the actor playing the disabled character. Sure, I know him from other movies, but this was really out in left field for him and he did an excellent job.  The story is basically about his relationship with a little girl, and while there are obvious areas that this film covers (suggested child molestation), what the director and cast do with the material takes things in a direction you won't expect.

Mary Stuart Masterson is excellent, giving a multi-layered performace, much as she did in Fried Green Tomatoes, and the settings (I believe it was shot in North Carolina) are priceless--very authentic and period: seedy roadside motel/apartments, feeling of isolation, etc. Overall, there's not a lot I can find fault with. The film did seem short, and while it's not earth shattering or terribly deep, it has to be one of the more unusual looks at skewed relationships.

For those who like IFC and other places to see movies that don't necessarily make it in the mainstream, this will be one you'll want to buy.  Also enjoyed the movies ""The Oppposite of Sex"" and ""Widows' Peak."" Nothing like this film, but again, different and worth a shot.",1158537600,,1414,4.644
189561,5,1572526564,"This movie was great.  Most people, myself included, had never heard of it, but that doesn't mean it won't appeal to many people.  It's not a mainstream movie because there isn't a whole lot of action.  The actors do a superb job with the scant storyline, especially the little girl, Evan Rachel Wood.  Kevin Bacon plays a mentally retarded man, who seems to be a little too intelligent in certain parts, but that is a minor flaw (Bacon, after all, isn't really mentally retarded).  The story is one of a friendship between a child and a man who has the mentality of a child, and I think this story is beautiful.  I loved it.",1142208000,,625,4.43859649122807
189562,3,1572526564,"For one I give this movie five stars because I was an extra in this movie. I will never forget meeting Kevin Bacon and Timothy Hutton it was a dream come true. The year was 1996. They filmed the movie in Cherokee, NC. I worked at Santa's Land and was around them for 2 months. Me and my friend watched them do some of the filming at a brown house close to where food lion is in

Cherokee, NC. The only sad part I waited two years to see this movie and a lot of parts they filmed at Santa's Land they cut out including the extra part I was in. I worked four hours on the set as a extra. It was so fun. They gave me some cool colored shoes to wear and pulled my hair up. I worked as an elf at santa's land everyday so I wore my elf suit in the film but it was like a green dress with no belt. The days I still remember it like it was yesterday.

I kissed Timothy Hutton on the check and I still remember

that for sure. I liked this movie but was sad to see a lot

of it was cut out. If anyone has this on dvd let me know

if they have the uncut scenes on it. I have only seen the

vhs.

189566,5,1572526564,"Timothy Hutton's uplifting plot for his 1997 movie ""Digging to China"" -- which is the coming of age between a parent and child (Mary Stewart Masterson's ""Gwen"" and Evan Rachel Wood's ""Harriet,"" respectively) -- projects a very significant and timely social message. The theme's impact on the audience, which is our realization that a parent-child relationship can be fostered even in the worst of circumstances, rivets the audience to their seats as they listen to the movie's last song, Patty Griffin's ""One Big Love."" From the start of this movie, we witness Gwen and Harriet trying to sort out, not only their own relationship, but every relationship that they have -- and they succeed, despite seemingly insurmountable odds.
In the beginning of the story, which takes place in 1969 rural Pennsylvania, twenty-five-year-old Gwen, who is ten-year-old Harriet's mother, pathetically tries to find friendship from the line of suitors she meets at the low-rent, run-down resort that she owns, and rarely leaves. Gwen maintains a rather peculiar lie to everyone (including Harriet, who believes it's true). Gwen claims that ten-year-old Harriet is her sister who is being raised by their mother, an aging alcoholic played by Cathy Moriarty (""mom""). ""Mom's"" only consistency is displaying questionable judgement. ""Mom"" plays along with Gwen's lie, and takes on the task of being Harriet's mother. When she goes out she's always drunk, which does not stop her from driving her canary-yellow 1965 Mustang (often on the wrong side of the road), at times, with ten-year-old Harriet in the car. At home, besides washing the dishes and helping Gwen maintain their resort, Harriet is tasked with mixing ""mom's"" martinis. ""Mom's"" indiscretions ultimately claim her life in a drunken automobile accident (in the middle of the story's development) forcing Gwen and Harriet's face-off, and subsequent parent-child development.
Harriet finds it difficult to make friends with the children she meets at school. Her innocence lost somewhere between ""mom's"" judgement and witnessing Gwen's precarious behavior around the resort. She is not taught ""normal"" social skills, and as a result not fit in with other children at school. But, despite this, she seems caring, and looks for friends -- though, like everything else in her life, this becomes confused as well. She looks in unconventional places, and finds an unlikely friend. Like Gwen, Harriet befriends a guest who's staying at their resort. The friend she finds is a retarded (soon to be institutionalized) thirty-year-old man -- ""Ricky,"" who is convincingly portrayed by Kevin Bacon. It's soon after ""mom's"" deadly accident, and Harriet's friendship to Ricky surfaces that we begin to witness a new Gwen -- she's transformed into someone who begins to show some concern about what Harriet does, or doesn't do. She starts becoming a parent. After ""mom's"" funeral, Gwen breaks the news to a shocked (and, at first disbelieving) Harriet: ""I'm your mother."" Gwen begins the often unpleasant (and unpopular) task of being a parent. She points out, to a rebellious Harriet, that Ricky can't be, or shouldn't be, a ten-year-olds' best friend. After several of Harriet's rebellious outbursts, a pattern emerges as Gwen maintains: ""you can't keep running away Harriet. This is your life. So, you had better get used to it, and you'd better get used to me.""
As parent and child continue to realize their true roles, Harriet, becomes increasingly rebellious, runs away with Ricky (planning to use the draft dodger's famous ""Underground Railroad""), and she and Ricky have an innocent wedding ceremony in a lake (very 60's). Harriet's attitude begins to change when she runs back home to Gwen -- for help saving an ailing Ricky who exclaims that he needs his mom. Gwen, naturally, is very concerned and protective, as she tries to divide the relationship between Harriet and Ricky. Harriet begins receiving, and absorbing messages that she's getting from other guests who say the ""Gwen missed you very much."" Several days later, after Ricky leaves, it appears as if Gwen and Harriet are ready to move forward as well.
In the closing scene, Harriet is in bed, and the place normally occupied by ""mom"" is empty. Gwen is out on the porch, sitting on a lawn chair, alone, without the company of one of her boyfriends. Needing her empty space in bed occupied by a parent, Harriet calls out to Gwen, with a suggestion--that almost sounds like an instruction manual for parents: ""Gwen, your supposed to tell me a story until the Sandman comes."" Obviously thrilled, or possibly relieved, Gwen says: ""Do I pick us the subject, or do you?"" Harriet replies ""Either,"" as Gwen pauses, and gets up to tell her daughter a bedtime story.
This movie's theme, and the realistic way that it's presented by the story line and its outstanding performances, has many applications that, with a little thought, could relate in some way to most people who see this movie. Single parents, parents, rebellious kids, people with mental or physical limitations, and all those who know and care about someone that fall into one of those categories can learn from the growth experienced by ""Digging to China's"" Gwen and Harriet.",1015286400,7,5224,5.132629107981221
