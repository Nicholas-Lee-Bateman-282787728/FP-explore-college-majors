I thought Phillipa Gregory had done the worst to the Tudors but this is in the same league.",1464220800,,254,4.163265306122449
8732105,3,B014VVNR9Y,"The other reviewer mentions most of the surface and background of their love for each other. But this should have been expanded to include important names involved, especially in the second half it was a real let down. Lets see now, oh yes, Where is Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell and several others not even mentioned here. Not even in passing, nothing. Aren't they important enough in relation to what happened to Anne??
 Even if there were time restraints, how can you leave out all the major players involved in this story of Anne and Henry?? My goodness, it was fine to see and hear passages from their love letters to each other. But and I repeat but their was to much left out at the end to be able to understand what was happening to Queen Anne. For goodness sake Henry was at Wolf Hall making planes with Jane Seymour and did in fact marry her 11 days after Anne's beheading. ( The fact that he married Seymour 11 days later is all that mentioned here by Lipscomb)
 So, to me this was a big,big disappointment. Was expecting a lot more.",1455926400,,1043,4.455497382198953

This entertaining documentary by Dr Suzannah Lipscomb takes a fairly romantic but documented approach to the Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn story and attempts to flesh out the personalities of the two in order to help us understand their motivations and actions.  Naturally there is a little supposition to describing personalities of historical characters.  But I felt some of Lipscomb's justification was perfectly plausible and she is using a few snippets of writings and records to suggest Henry and Anne were much more complex than simple caricatures passed down.  Anne is not just a calculating vixen used as a political pawn.  Henry is not just a king obsessed with an heir, or his next conquest to replace the last wife.  They are not just wanton court animals playing at love.  Suzannah presents a case that shows a pious side to both that accompanies all the other passions.  She shows a case for true love between the two (at least for a time) that was quite extraordinary.  All the while this narration by Ms Lipscomb is very lively and polished.  The documentary has both a professional and entertaining feel.  Just remember the approach and style of this program is slightly different than a simple list of historical details.

CONTENT:  I will give an indication of each episode without giving away everything for the viewer.

EPISODE 1:  This half focuses on the latter youth of both Anne and Henry before their relationship, and then the courtship.  It covers a little of their educational background which contributes to their personality and actions.  The case is made for Anne's conservative side that compliments the arts of courtly love she would have learned in France.  Henry's tall, athletic, affable nature as a young man.  His education religiously and specific mentions of scripture, in context, that may have led him to believe he was being cursed for marrying his brother's queen after his death.  The quote of Anne Boleyn I mention in the title (written in the margins of a Book of Hours belonging to Anne) is explained, though the date and her meaning is not known.  This relationship's direct affect on the course of England is suggested by the gift of Tindale's writings ""Obedience of Christian Man"" which supported the concept to Henry that the King is judge over all, and over him there is no judge (King, not the church is the ultimate law).  Some of the few surviving writings between Henry and Anne are very beautiful and moving.

EPISODE 2: Pick up the story with the marriage of Henry and Anne, along with Anne's challenges to give him an heir.  This begins to strain the marriage.  Opposition from Catholics who supported Catherine also puts pressure on the union.  However, we still see very eloquent written exchanges between Henry and Anne that suggest they were very much in love.  Henry's jousting accident, not long after the passing of Queen Catherine, and apparent personality changes thereafter are covered along with the reopening of his old wound.  Anne's final miscarriage and a return to Henry's feeling of guilt that god had cursed him.  Anne's enemies begin to construct her downfall and take advantage of Henry's changing moods and paranoia of a sort.  Anne seems unaware of the full weight or perilous nature of her situation until shortly before the end.  Dr, Lipscomb makes a trip to show historical documents showing the original charges laid out against Anne.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  In only two hours I don't expect an in-depth look at such a historical period or relationship.  But I did really appreciate the somewhat more human look at what Anne and Henry could have been like.  For strict historians looking only for nitty gritty timelines and hard core details, that's not as much the focus of this program.  I enjoy hard core documentaries also.  But I think this one is meant to give life to characters, while also making the subject accessible to a broader audience.  For that I won't fault it.  One can always take the interest inspired by a show like this and look for serious scholarly writings.  That said, the scholarship in this program is still quite good, while also being eloquent and moving.  The actors enact lines from writings made specifically by Anne or Henry.  They are played by Emma Connell and Jack Hawkins respectively and both are very appropriate to at least the young Anne and Henry.  Both are very attractive and give moving performances in short dramatizations.  There are also brief trips to places significant to both Anne and Henry:  Hever Castle, seat of the Boleyn family; Chateau de Blois where Anne would have been at the French court for a time;  Hampton Court for Henry; Thornburry Castle; and what's left of the old palace of Whitehall.  If you appreciate both a little romance and dramatic reenactment in your documentaries, you should enjoy this one a great deal.",1449705600,4,5035,4.8947990543735225
