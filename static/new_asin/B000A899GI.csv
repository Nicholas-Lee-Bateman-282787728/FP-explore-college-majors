8076152,5,B000A899GI,"This is a very delicate sad story about a man who's heart is frozen that he cannot love a woman that he yearn.
Daniel Auteuil and Andre Dussollier are two partners working together at a viloineshop. Andre is a CEO and Daniel is a Violin maker.
When Adre met Emmanuelle Beart, a beautiful violinist, Daniel at the same time falls in love with her.
Daniel is a cold hearted man who doesn't know how to love someone. According to him, he has no trauma or anything but he just couldn't open his mind to receive a serious love.
When he happens to approach Emmanuelle, she becomes crazy at him.
Daniel's partner Andre is a tptally opposite kind of charactor. He is a warm hearted understanding kind of a guy. When he finds out that his girlfrind fell in love with Daniel, he even urge Daniel to meet her.
But when Daniel injured her by saying I cannot love you or give you anything. I don't know how to love you. My heart is frozen like a winter and the girl crashed, Andre got really mad.
Daniel lost his partner Andre and Emmanuelle at the same time.
At the end of the movie Emmanuelle goes back to Andre and they become happy.
Being left alone, Daniel opens his own shop.
The ending seems very delicate and sad to me.
When Emmanuelle and Andere stop by the cafe where Daniel have a coffee, They have a brief moment and when Andre got the car and Emmanuelle ride his car and fades away, she gives Daniel the last gaze as if she is seeing him for the last time in her life.
I felt that she still loves Daniel. She will never tell Daniel that she is or even a single motion she will make in her life, but the thing is the moment she loved her will never fade away. And so does Daniel's emotion towards her.
This is a very sad love song. And it's because that this movie was made in France this was possible,
France alwas has this delicate, romantic details that not other country can make.
The director Clade Sauter is an unfortunate guy. He made a lot of movies in his life but this is the only movie that was recognized by the audience.
But is was well known and also awarded the second price at Venice. This movie is the one you should search and watch if you have time.
It's nothing like time killing Hollywood film.",1458172800,2,2214,4.261282660332542
8076153,5,B000A899GI,"A Heart in Winter (Un Coeur en hiver) is a 1991 film by Claude Sautet (Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud, 1995, Sautet's last film). It stars Daniel Auteuil, Emmanuelle Bart and Andr Dussolier. The film is a portrayal of the inner life of the character played by Auteuil, an instrument maker called Stephane, and when you watch the film you cannot but pay tribute to the talents of Auteuil, probably the greatest French actor of his generation.

Watching the film requires a shift in the expectations of the viewer. What you see and hear is almost banal, as three charming and gifted characters create and experience the tragedy of a love triangle. But the film is more importantly a character study, and the film maker expects the viewer to follow Stephane's inner life just as one does the personal politics of a board meeting, where what is said might not have an accurate bearing on what is negotiated, or when in the company of an estranged couple, both friends, where what is expressed bears reference to a past trauma. Body language tells a more complete story than dialogue in this film; we as English speakers have a more difficult job than those who share the French culture in deciphering what is going on, but, thanks to brilliant acting, it can be done.

Most critics have described Stephane as emotionally void, unable to respond to the people in his life. Perhaps they have been too influenced by the fact that this is what Stephane at one point tells Camille (Bart). One responds to the meaning of body language in a personal way, and in what I say there is nothing definitive, merely my interpretation of what I see. Others will see differently perhaps.

The first clue lies in the music, by Ravel, heard throughout the film. We see Stephane's response, exquisitely accurate and, in my view, deeply passionate. Stephane is a man moved by music as few of us are but as more of us should be. We learn he was an accomplished violin student but gave up playing. His strongest emotional bond is with his music teacher, who provides Stephane with the nearest thing he has to a home. The love between the two men is evident. Listen to the subtly different way the teacher talks to Stephane and to Maxime, Stephane's friend and business partner (Dussolier) who is another former student. Stephane is a man with both a powerful response to music and a deep, deep respect for it. This sensitivity has led him to undervalue his own ability as an interpreter. He has ceased to play his violin.

But when he hears Camille, an aspiring concert violinist and the girlfriend of  Maxime, play at a recording session, this passionate response, controlled as it is, attracts Camille powerfully. By contrast, Maxime's response to music is an intellectual one. He appreciates, while Stephane is moved. Stephane has not been able to stay away from Camille, even though he knows this is a love he shouldn't pursue.

Camille, who, like most performers, leads an intensely disciplined life of music practice, rehearsal and concert performance, is sustained by her own love of music. She knows what music means to Stephane because it means as much to her. Her recognition of this quality in Stephane turns to love. But here she meets a rebuff. While Maxime has affairs (which he hides from his wife) and is prepared to leave his wife for Camille (""it's better for her - his wife - as well"" he tries to justify), this is not the kind of behaviour Stephane can emulate. His love and respect for his friend and business partner is too great for him to betray Maxime. He tells Camille he doesn't love her, that he cannot love at all, that Maxime is not a friend, merely a convenience for him. She knows intuitively this isn't true. We, the viewers, have half a film to show us it isn't true.

Stephane is a man with powerful emotional responses, who feels love and respect for his friends and colleagues, and for music. When there is a conflict it is always his emotional response Stephane seeks to control. Perhaps he is too humble. He is shown as a genuinely good man, one who truly cares for others. In one scene Camille watches Stephane instruct and guide his apprentice. He acts with both love and with discipline, and Camille watches, absorbed in what she sees. It is an important building block in their relationship.

The resolution of the romantic triangle comes as Stephane, deeply divided by two conflicting emotions, rebuffs Camille. She is terribly hurt. She thinks it shameful for Stephane to deny his love for her. Perhaps women, who too often have been excluded from the central place in a man's heart because it is taken by some value which he shares with other men, will sympathise with this scorn more than male viewers. I felt Camille was not able to see the principles that moved Stephane to withhold his love. Ironically it is Camille's shame and hurt that enable Stephane to acknowledge the importance of the love he feels, but when he comes to try and explain, it is too late. Camille has exhausted her emotion, and feels nothing for Stephane any more. She is the shallower character.

And the film ends with Stephane, alone, his heart in winter. His teacher has died, his partner Maxime pursues his business alone, Camille goes back to Maxime because she has nowhere else to go. Stephane is left with his deep love, and for the moment no-one to bestow it on.

We all wear masks, and what we tell people about ourselves bears little relationship to who we are. But our masks are transparent to anyone who will see through them, for those who will take the trouble to look. What we all want is love, but sometimes it is so very, very hard to ask for it.",1129766400,10,5654,4.656312625250501
8076154,5,B000A899GI,"This most intelligent and meaningful film, along with Claude Sautet's NELLY AND MONSIEUR ARNAUD, teaches us an important lesson in how to love---that love is not about possessing another person---that real love helps in our human development and psychological maturity and independence.  Stephan and Maxim are cultivated and wise men who work repairing violins.  Both former musicians, Stephan is the violin artisan and Maxim works personally with the violinists, ""clients whom he considers patients"".  They are best friends and they both fall in love with a beautiful exceptionally talented young violinist, Camille.  How these two emotionally elegant, un-macho, un-competitive men (except safely sublimated in their tennis matches) are both willing to lose Camille to the other is marvelous just to see.  They are like two angels helping a young person/artist to develop and mature---while she is certainly talented, she is young and therefore, too aggressive and conquering towards other people.  While Camille is remarkable, her youthful narcissism and aggressive romantic fixations, her inadequate psychological borders and lack of interior solidity and independence, (""When he's there, he's there.  Then suddenly it's like I don't exist."") are hindering  her personal relations and her artistic development.  Both Stephan and Maxim love Camille but are willing to lose her for her sake---both are willing to lose their love (Camille) for the sake of their love (Camille).  Open your heart and mind to Sautet's subtle and sublime film and you will be rewarded again and again with each viewing.",1127779200,3,1599,5.516393442622951

You must be in a special for appreciate with a majuscule glee this superb movie.

Magnificent score with Ravel music and a cast headed by the great Daniel auteil, one of my loved French actresses the always beauty Emanuelle Beart (Manon of spring and more recently Nathalie) and this legendary actor Andre Dusolier.",1127088000,,533,5.056818181818182
