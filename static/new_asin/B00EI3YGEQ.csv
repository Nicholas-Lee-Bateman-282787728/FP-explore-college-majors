8605552,5,B00EI3YGEQ,My Granddaughters and I love little Madeline and her friends.  They are all so sweet and precious.  Madeline stories teach good behavior and sensitivity toward others.  There is a typical little boy who learns that bad selfish behavior does not get him anything.  Instead he learns that kind and considerate behavior makes for wonderful friends and fun.  I highly recommend Madeline books and DVDs.  The DVDs are clear and colorful; and hearing the French language being spoken is a great experience for the viewers.,1395964800,2,516,5.083333333333333

8605554,5,B00EI3YGEQ,"I remember watching Madeline when I was a child and I absolutely adored it - every second of it. In fact as I grew up and the episodes on the TV became scarce I never forgot the theme song to the show and often found myself humming along to it in my head. When I discovered that these DVD's's had been released I was very quick in purchasing each one I could find - not a huge amount - 8 separate DVD's with a varying amount of episodes but hell, even having just a few is more excitement than I intended of ever being able to find. I know I am no longer a child but I love the fact that if I ever have my own child that I will now be able to share apart of my childhood that made my day every day it aired on the TV. Even so with that in mind, I am still quite content to sit down and watch these DVD's, while now they seem quite childish to me, it definitely is a childish amount of love I am happy to endure.

8605555,5,B00EI3YGEQ,Such an adorable series - again buy these for my baby niece; I grew up reading and watching the series my own self. Its a collection of some of the older original episodes and the newer ones from the re-launch of the series.,1386288000,4,224,4.232558139534884
