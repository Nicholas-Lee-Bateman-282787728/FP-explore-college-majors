There are a lot of drills that are useful, if you learn by that method.  The tips are clear and concise without connfounding the user with a bunch of unnecessary details.

8074635,5,B000A5N4IU,"""My Greatest Tips""

For the past 15 years it has been my pleasure and honor to have worked with some of the world's top players including Nick Faldo, Ernie Els, Nick Price and Greg Norman as well as many amateurs.  Throughout this period and over 7 best-selling videos I have developed a series of techniques that help players of all abilities discover the elusive elements that enable them to play great golf.  Well, I may have changed over the last 15 years but, fortunately, the fundamentals of golf haven't.

Now for the first time, I have compiled the best of these tips and thoughts into one program, taking you from tee to green, including many of the hazards commonly encountered in the game of golf.

This new video includes all the drills and tips that have proved the most successful in helping players lower their scores over the years.  Don't try too much at first - find a tip that suits you best and work on it until you feel comfortable and then move on.

Happy Golfing.",1145404800,,986,4.536723163841808
