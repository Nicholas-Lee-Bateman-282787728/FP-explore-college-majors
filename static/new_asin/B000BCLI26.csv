They come new and sealed like from the store.",1316649600,,100,3.7142857142857144
8085425,4,B000BCLI26,"We got these a couple years back and our kids love them.  We give them to our kids one at a time for birthdays and Christmas, and they're some of their favorite videos.  I grew up reading these books and buying the videos was actually cheaper than buying all of the books individually because there are 4-6 books on each DVD.  Don't worry... my kids still read plenty the traditional way, but they enjoy seeing the classic illustrations animated and hearing it dramatized and with music.  We have also purchased other Scholastic videos that aren't in this collection.  If you can afford these, get them.  Our family loves them.",1289520000,,627,4.706422018348624
8085426,5,B000BCLI26,My wife is the Media Coordinator at a local elementary school.  She purchased this collection for the school library and the kids LOVE them!

8085428,5,B000BCLI26,"This is a great collection of the best kids' books expertly animated and narrated.  Heartwarming and witty, every one of these stories will not disappoint.  Do yourself and your kids a favor, buy the collection.  Support a quality product.",1204156800,,239,5.076923076923077
8085429,5,B000BCLI26,"I bought this scholastic 27 video collection for my 2.5 year old daughter for Christmas when it was available during gold box deals.  After applying my gift certificate, the cost was right around $85.  My daughter LOVES a lot of these books (Where The Wild Things Are is a favorite), so we thought the video series would be a nice gift for long car rides and such.  We've only watched ""Click Clack Moo"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are"" so far, but we are happy with the quality of the videos.  It's also nice that there are other stories and songs on the DVD and not just the title story.  This is a great value for the money!",1196035200,2,625,4.262711864406779
8085430,5,B000BCLI26,My wife is a 2nd grade school teacher. When I showed her this collection in the Gold Box deal of the day she didn't hesitate a moment in having me order it. It's a wonderful collection of educational yet entertaining DVDs based on the original print material. At less than $5 per DVD this was an outstanding purchase.,1195948800,2,317,4.482758620689655
8085431,5,B000BCLI26,"My children, ages 2 and 4, are both big fans of the scholastic videos. We started off with Where the Wild Things Are and Mike Mulligan and based on their enthusiasm for those we purchased this bundle. We have not yet watched all of them as there are several to get through, but so far each has delivered the same great entertainment. Reading a book first and then seeing the movie or the other way around has added a whole new excitement to reading these classics with my children. I would highly recommend this set and any of the other scholastic videos to anyone trying to encourage little ones in their love of books!",1183593600,13,620,4.447368421052632
8085432,5,B000BCLI26,This pack has a TON of classic and not so well known books from the 60's to newer things. Some of the movies are questionable in content but what do you expect for older movies. All in all a great purchase.,1173657600,5,206,4.048780487804878
8085433,5,B000BCLI26,"I was fearful when I purchased my first Scholastic Video that the interpretations would somehow sully the original books for my son, or alter their meaning.  The animation, the songs, the voices are all consistent with the feelings of the original books.  They are beautifully done.  There are only a few that aren't fully animated.  The books that are included in this collections are all books I would want in my son's library, and I have, in fact, purchased some of them after viewing the videos.  Each dvd includes about 3 stories, and usually at least two 'extras'.  I would recommend that anyone interested in this collection invest in the 27 DVD bundle.  However, there are more DVD's to purchase.",1163721600,29,704,4.816666666666666
