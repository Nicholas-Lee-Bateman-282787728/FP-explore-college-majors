5677686,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"To me, it is one of the most uplifting experiences to listen to music, creating that state of fulfillment inside you - where you end up with just a happy  Ok. Thank you. No more questions!"" - concluding life is just beautiful.  While listening to a beautiful (Free) improvised piece on Kenny Werner`s first of two instructional DVD Melody, Harmony & Rhythm"" (jazzheaven.com) this is definently the case.
Just a few notes, and my a foggy day in Cologne town (sadly waiting for spring to come)"" agony turns into a positive hmm ... - what am I at least waiting for? Let`s get to work"" state of mind. Anyway, let`s stay reasonable, and wait for actual instructions to come.""

It`s a few minutes later that I can`t avoid getting seated at the piano telling myself yes yes ... I`ll keep watching ... but it will cause no harm to let my fingers explore the keyboard a little bit along with Kenny`s talking ... ."" A few minutes later, as Kenny starts explaining his string concept, I experience myself pressing the pause button, since I cannot resist playing any longer; suddenly I feel enabled to create some of the most beautiful lines I heard myself play ever, almost on the spot, after just a few minutes of practicing. Oh, did I say practicing? Wasn`t it more of just fooling around, enjoying myself and the instrument, achieving amazing results?

I wonder, if one could ever expect more from an instructional DVD?

Years ago, Kenny`s book  Effortless Mastery"" meant an awesome step forward to me already: eventually there was someone speaking out on issues such as passion, our personal shakiness, spirituality, or even worse"": music and Love.

Bringing in account the musician behind the musician, the book was a milesstone. It stands next to the groundbreaking works of Heinrich Jakoby, the sadly underated giant in the history of teaching music (at least his works are only available in his native german language - as far as I know).

By having Kenny Werner available at my living room, whenever and as long as I want, many of the issues both of them point out, become more tangible - and real (I highly recommend to by the DVD forever"" instead of going for a 24 h or 90 days account).

The teachings at least remind me of the time that I was fortunately part of Bob Brookmeyer`s composers class at the Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik K&ouml;ln in the mid 90`s. It`s the same mind changing quality, only going a step further by Effortless Mastery: The 4 Steps"", directly adressing our state of mind while practicing or performing.

I sometimes heard musicians criticize Kenny for claiming a kind of a Guruship. On both DVDs I never had the impression this is the case. What I experience is a musician sharing his excitement and passion for all aspects of music. I find the teachings pretty much down to earth, real life"" orientated, and probably enriching for any open minded person interested in improvisation.

5677687,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"Everything I would expect in an instruction video of this time.  Lots of material presented, a great value.  The presenter has some very interesting ideas (in particular, related to harmony) which I've not come across elsewhere.  His style is very relaxed, making him very easy to listen to, and he's also very easy to understand.",1393459200,2,330,4.963636363636364
5677688,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"Effortless Mastery of Melody Harmony and Rhythm is a further developement of Mr. Werners' epic book,Effortless Mastery.
On this DVD he demonstrates personally,with his usual kindness and wisdom, exercizes he has developed over his career that he still employs today. These tie in perfectly with the 4th step.
His approach gets to the heart of the 3 elements of music in a very easy to understand and methodical manner, and his unique and humorous personality puts us at ease as we take in bite size pieces of music into our inner world for nurture and growth.
As someone who has struggled for many many years, I've found all of Mr. Werners' matierials to be invigorating and confidence building. A milestone in education, and mostly alot of fun!  Bill Kahl",1393027200,,756,4.8604651162790695
5677689,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"I highly enjoyed this content.  Having read Kenny's Effortless Mastery and taken some lessons with him I was familiar with his approach to cultivating a healthy mindset and comfortable relationship to your instrument.  This is a fantastic ""practical"" counterpart to his other materials.  This DVD very effectively covers the basics of ALL music (jazz in particular) and gives usable exercises that should get any student progressing quickly in the areas of performance and composition.  If there is an aspect of playing modern jazz that you don't find at least touched on after watching this video then go back and watch it one more time.",1390608000,3,638,5.105769230769231

This is amazing, I recommend Jazz Heaven if you are looking for a trustworthy company to buy online media.",1379808000,2,432,4.333333333333333

5677693,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"I already been a fan of Kenny's book Effortless Mastery and watched many videos of him in clinics, but they don't have the level of detail and insights this DVD contains.  Kenny breaks things down to Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm and ways to practice and how he approaches them.  The section on harmony has open me up to some great sounds I wasn't using before.  There is also interview with Kenny that he talks about his musical life and it was an eye opener too.  I highly recommend this DVD not only to Jazz musicians but all musicians will discover new ways to look at music.",1365811200,,577,4.415094339622642
5677694,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"This video is a monster ! Most of the ideas in the first video of Kenny's (The Four Steps) are already out there, and while I think having the video is key to a deeper understanding of the concepts you may already be familiar with, the second video (Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm) is probably the most concise method I have ever heard of on how to play jazz, and packed with so many things I have never heard explained so well. It is deceivingly simple, but like Effortless Mastery, so profound. His methods for breaking things down into manageable parts, and applying them, are just incredible.

The first section is on Melody, and how to practice melody's using his ""String Theory"". Part of this approach to practicing Melody has to do with targets, but his method is thorough, and truly profound. Right away I realized, I never truly practiced melodies, and why not? They are after all exactly what I should be practicing all the time because I play a melodic instrument. For me I never really knew exactly how to construct new melodies all the time, one after another, and although I had the raw materials, I never practiced quite like this.

The second section is about Harmony, and how he goes outside the stated chords. This section is deceivingly simple, because after watching the demonstrations, and applying it myself, I thought to myself, first that it was much easier than I thought, and second that there were so many beautiful sounds to explore in this way, it really opened up my ears. I should say, still is really opening up my ears.

The next section is on Rhythm, and how he approaches practicing rhythm. He goes through some exercises, and how to apply them, but my favorite part was about phrasing. He explained a few things, that later when I was listening to music in the car, I was hearing the phrases resolve in a completely new way, that I hadn't even noticed before.

This Lesson is Pure Genius !

I highly recommend getting both The Four Steps and Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm videos !",1365379200,,2011,4.621848739495798
5677695,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"Kenny Werner is unique, in my experience, in his ability to translate into succinct linear thinking what an artist does automatically and spontaneously.

Other reviews have covered most of the descriptive details, so I will focus on my perspective as an artist to describe what makes Kenny Werner's work -including thIs wonderful DVD- unique and extremely necessary in the world of music pedagogy.

This DVD covers the different technical  elements one has to master and how to remain creative and free at the same time in terms of practical expression of inspired music making.

The effective methods to reach this state of creative freedom and  awareness and full experience of musical manifestation are at the core of Kenny Werner's work as a master teacher.

The topics covered are approached in an artistic manner, rather than  dry academic linear rule memorization. Much of the current academic methodology is great, and quite necessary, mostly for basic, intermediate and advanced theoretical knowledge, yet, given it's post factual analytic stance, falls way short in explaining creative methods and technical conception used by actual improvising artists. These artistic methods actually transcend basic and even the most contemporary advanced academic  concepts and go beyond, much beyond. Kenny Werner shows how to do this very effectively and very clearly and he goes directly to the points at hand.

Most importantly, getting into the state of pure inspiration is the crux of the matter as physical technique is mastered. That is the difference between an artist who is also a brilliant technician that reaches and audience deeply compared to a brilliant craftsman that makes a very impressive but forgettable impression on the same audience. Kenny Werner shows what he and any other jazz great actually does and how to think and act like a great artist.

The methods in melodic shaping and harmonic development are always related to,  and used in the context of real inspiring . moving, music.

Rhythm is  in my experience the most absurdly unstudied and neglected (by many professional musicians and teachers) important factor in most musical genres, because without it there is simply no genres to speak off! and no other type of music as we have practiced since pre-historical times.  All one would hear is uninterrupted sound or silence. Rhythm is the interruption of constant universal sound  (the eternal now) or in more everyday reality: The interruption of silence, taking us  into the domain of time. Without it there is no melody possible, only silence or uninterrupted sound!

I have the privilege of working often with some of the world's most prominent jazz artists, and one of my favorite things to do, before gigs or during rehearsal breaks, is to chat informally with them about what one does. I've verified that all, do the same things taught on Kenny Werner's book ""Effortless Mastery"" and on this DVD. The reader would be very surprised if I told you who among well know jazz masters has read Kenny's book and learned from it. In fact two days ago I was stoked on the phone with a world renown bass player and after I told him about these new DVDs he got very excited to find out about this new DVD and was ready to order it (Kenny W. is one of his favorites) after his headlining concert at Blues Alley.

I would like to say that the contents are very easy to understand and very fun to work on..as music should be for all!",1364947200,2,3457,4.931034482758621
5677696,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"I've been following Kenny Werner since the late 90's. To me his playing and conception stands alongside the greatest jazz players of our time. Its about that special magical/spiritual connection and immediacy he has to the music and his instrument that only the best jazz musicians achieve, that transcends theory, technique and style. Kenny is also a master communicator who can take the intangible or complex and express it simply, getting to the essence quickly.

Kenny's Effortless Mastery book and his approach to music has always been inspirational to me and many others. I've taken a few lessons with him and the ideas I've learned from him have been invaluable to me. Many years ago he told me he was working on a jazz theory book, so when I saw this video come up my interest was piqued. A Kenny Werner jazz theory video, even better! So I bought this from JazzHeaven and just watched it yesterday.

The video starts out with ""Free Improv #1"" a wonderfully lyrical piano improvisation where you can see Kenny just let one idea flow into the next, until he seamlessly transitions into ""If I should Lose You"" which strangely enough was a tune I've been  practicing just a few days ago. Damn all that meditation must make him psychic :-) Halfway through his ""String theory"" lesson, a beautifully simple and elegant way to visualize building elastic lines around a few pivot resolution points in a phrase, I'm impressed with how simply he unifies this with chromaticism, approach notes and outside playing. In the space of just a few minutes he has explained so many powerful melodic development techniques that others take books to cover!

As I watch further, it gets even better. While the DVD would have been worth the price of admission for just the String theory chapter, the sections on Harmony and Rhythm are as groundbreaking. Harmony starts out with Kenny's lush reharm of ""It Came Upon A Midnight Clear"". He then goes on to detail his personal harmonic conception, using different chord qualities and root motion, going through an exercise on the whiteboard to discover unusual harmonic resolutions that go beyond what most people think of based on traditional harmony.
The rest of the DVD is dedicated to Kenny's approach to rhythm and techniques to improve practice and concentration. I've taken some classes with him on these subjects and the materials here go much beyond what I did with him so I'm thrilled having access to this.

Summary
---------

If you are an intermediate to advanced jazz player, this is *the* jazz instructional video to get. In one DVD, Kenny covers the entire spectrum of ingredients that a jazz player needs to work on. Melody, Harmony and Rhythm, and he puts these three elements together in a cohesive and deep way that no one else has done before. Nothing I have seen even comes close to this, in terms of the level and quality of instruction here.

You can see that Kenny put a lot of thought and work into the presentation and production of this DVD. This is not a hacked together disjointed instructional video, like many others I've seen. The material is very thoughtfully and logically presented, Kenny's communication is flawless, and the video quality is great. The treat is that you can see Kenny's hands throughout the performances and there are three full improvisations on the DVD. If you are a jazz musician serious about getting better or making the most of your practice time you won't ever regret buying this!",1364688000,3,3473,4.8465430016863404
8574507,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"Have you ever left a jigsaw puzzle undone because at some point the fun and joy of doing it left and it became tedious? The picture on the box was beautiful and would be nice but after struggling so long to fit the pieces together you thought about putting it all back in the box and doing something else? I was just there with my music. After starting piano lessons at almost 19 years old and started playing professionally at 21 and getting a Masters Degree in Music by 30 I was good and getting better. But always hearing someone younger and better playing at that master level that though I was inching up on, never quite felt like I totally got it. People told me how good I was, but I never felt good enough, never let successes make me feel better about my music and art. Then, I found Effortless Mastery while bedridden from Hip replacement at 64. From that book, I checked You Tube For Kenny Werner and found his DVD and site. After hearing his short talks I went immediately to the site and ordered This DVD and watched his video on my 24 hour pass to his site. I was breathless at his mastery and genius logic and in the short minute or two, I withstood the pain of my surgery and sat at my piano and tried some of his ideas and it was like all the Pieces of all the jumbled info I gathered immediately promised to form into a coherent whole. I went from depressed and sorry I ever got into music attitude into a new found excitement and hope. I can't wait for the DVD. I finally feel I will make it to the mountain top of my own personal goals thanks to this genius and brilliant mentor. A side note, had some issues with the site when I ordered that messed things up at first and they rectified it with speed and care! THEY REALLY CARE about the quality of everything here both artistically and business wise. Buy it! Buy it for someone you know loves music!",1482883200,2,1871,4.243697478991597
8574508,5,B00BVF8Q4K,"Covers different (more specific) information than the book (Effortless Mastery) and some of his Master Classes that you might see in videos.  I think the video content and quality makes it better than attending an in-person master class (in some ways) because you don't have to worry about absorbing all the material right away or taking notes.  I'm a fan of the online masterclass format and have one or two from many of the different online companies, but so far the Jazz Heaven videos are the highest quality in terms of video, sound, and content.

The exercises are elegant, simple, yet challenging.

As a saxophone player with limited practice time, I personally resonated with his approach to focused and very specific practice routines around melodic and rhythmic exercises. This is a way to make measurable progress towards breaking down the mental and technical barriers which prevent us from playing great -- all the time.

The Melody, Harmony and Rhythm video introduces some incredible concepts to structure your practice and has rescued me from being overwhelmed by all the things I want to practice. This is in addition to the very cool melodic, harmonic and rhythmic concepts that he presents.

This and his ""4 Steps"" video have caused me to re-structure my entire approach to practicing. Im enjoying it so much more and seeing real progress. Thank you!",1402531200,2,618,4.876190476190477

I was fascinated by the concept of kenny's practicing but couldn't put it in practice or at least i didn't see how i could possibly practice ""in the Space"". Kenny demonstrates how it's possible. I wouldn't say it's easy or you would do it right away after watching him but it definitely makes you want to try.
I would say this video could be worth watching for
1. People who have read the book
2. People who haven't read it and want something practical
3. People who enjoy Kenny as a pianist and want to have a deeper understanding of what he does.

I have to say the quality of recording and production is really top-notch which becomes a not so common thing for instructional video.
