2927204,1,B000UYX4XG,"This film had every chance in the world to make a meaningful statement about racial prejudice and threw each one away. Sonja Wilde's part, where she is obviously white or pale, is not very believable when she tells an employer she is part black so she can't get a job. James Franciscus overacts as her racist husband, but his script is at fault. The story needed some compelling event where she could admit she was part black and he could try to accept it (ex. the baby lived and resembled him as the real father) but instead he only rants and raves that she shouldn't socialize with black people. A bit too long where our bride must lie about her black father with no DVD extras to relieve the tedium.",1204156800,12,702,4.407692307692308
2927205,2,B000UYX4XG,"Having waited many years to see this film, I was anticipating a great quality DVD print for the price. Imagine my surprise when I sat down to enjoy it for the first time and noticed scratches and tears (think the opening credits of John Cassavete's Johnny Staccato. The full frame format makes it impossible to read the credits without losing half of the
names.
You would think such a rare gem as this would deserve to be remastered and preserved.
Having said that. Sonia Wilde and James Franciscus give excellent perormances and the supporting cast are fine.",1191888000,14,559,4.77319587628866
2927206,5,B000UYX4XG,"I saw this movie 47 years ago when I was age 7.  It is memorable and is an early attempt to show the injustice created by a society which insists races cannot mix.  Not only do I remember scenes from the movie, but I remember the tears running down my mother's face as the movie concluded with a predicable end.  I have long awaited the release of this movie.  I will soon see it for the second time after 47 years!",1188691200,29,415,4.08641975308642
2927207,2,B000UYX4XG,"Definitely a bit tacky of a movie. I must have been no more than elementary school age when my babysitter took me to the theaters to see it. I am Creole and if you know anything about Creoles, the unclassified race is a tad of an obsession. My grandmother was white and my family members look like a Benneton ad. But because of white America's 1% rule, what is white anyway? The creation of the Tea Party after President Obama's victorious 2008 win, is obviously code for some ugly white power phenomenon. Despite the fact that President Obama's mother was white and he was raised by his white grandparents.....it fuels racist's hatred all the more.
This came out before the peak of the Civil Rights Movement. I couldn't imagine it being released today. The scene where she goes wild dancing in the club is a hilarious. She's made to look like a cheap Flossie. Show it to your kids today to see just how ridiculous it all was.....if it has any redeeming qualities. I'm surprised that it didn't hurt James Franciscus' career. The lead actress though was never to be seen again.",1426291200,,1076,4.609375

2927212,4,B000UYX4XG,"Wish they had used real racially  mixed actress.
Bought mainly as a collector's Item . If you lived through the times where the color of your skin or ancestry is of African origin and it kept you from improving your life in the United States and you were able to Pass (looking White but called a Negro), then this movie should be a reminder of the cruelty that ignorant bigots practiced . Imagine that, bigots have been brained washed from childhood and can't understand why they must hate others even after they have fallen in love, had sex, wanted to marry and have babies with you and not knowing you're a mixture of Black and White or of African decent . These unfortunate, misinformed  creatures can't  decide if color or ancestry is an issue to hate, even if you looked White . Thank God these poor creatures are fading away and being replaced by level headed, educated humans who are marrying out side of their whiteness and having their own mixed children or adopting other brown , black and mixed children .This movie can be indexed in American History as a parallel to the troubles of the Dark Ages in Europe.

2927213,2,B000UYX4XG,"This movie comes off like a cautionary film screened for junior high girls during health class.  The narrative is about as sophisticated as a beach-blanket flick, with flat, coarsely drawn caricatures and a simplistic, predictable plot.  The dialogue is so juvenile that the fewer lines a player has, the more credible is his/her performance.
The passing protagonist speaks with an unaccountably Mexican-sounding accent, creating a constant subconscious perception that she is Hispanic.  Moreover, her thespian skills are barely passable and glaringly so in the presence of otherwise competent actors.
The only interesting scene in the movie is one in which the protagonist boogies down a bit too heartily at a country-clubbish dance.  The action descends into utter farce as her priggish husband and in-laws react in a silly, stereotypical parody of uptight white folks.
Otherwise, the film is watchable only as a curiosity.",1334966400,,925,5.4475524475524475
2927214,5,B000UYX4XG,"I am a 52 year old women now, and the first time I saw this film I was 9 years old, I always remember it, and I vowed that when and if I got the chance to purchase this I would, IIIIIIIIIII got it now, Woo Whoo, yippy.",1313971200,,218,3.5625
2927215,2,B000UYX4XG,"This ""anti-passing"" film has the usual racist message advocating the myth of white racial ""purity."" I was surprised to find that the heroine was sympathetically portrayed (as opposed to the mixed-white girl in the 1950's ""Imitation of Life,"" for example).  I was also surprised to find the realistic scenes of sympathetic ""pure"" whites who advise the heroine that she is, after all, really ""white"" and would be foolish to call herself a ""Negro.""  Bravo! That stigma has no more ethnic validity than the ""Aryan/non-Aryan"" idiocy of the Third Reich.

The film was consistent with other ""anti-passing"" films in showing only ""Negro"" relatives for the heroine in order to imply that she is only a mutation and not a descendants of whites.  The relatives who look like her are conveniently absent.  I was surprised that the grandmother (the ubiquitous ""mammy"" figure)said that she was ""married"" to ""a white man"" (the heroine's grandfather).  Where is he?  What happened to him?  In ""Imitation of Life,"" the cop-out is that she was married to a man who only ""looked white."" (If it looks like a white, it's a white!).  The grandmother makes up for her ""mistake"" by saying that she wouldn't do it again and that ""interracial"" marriage is wrong ""because of the children.""  Yeah, right.  If that's true, then people like the heroine SHOULD marry other whites and not blacks so the children won't be so confused with all those different colors in the family.

It's very easy for a mixed-white like the heroine to be part of the general white society.  It's trying to pretend to be a lighter version of ""Negro"" that is hard and ""living a lie.""  It was surprising that the film did show some of the latter, but of course it had to stack the deck against the heroine in order to frighten other potential ""passers"" (the real purpose of the movie).  The ""pure white"" husband of the heroine has to be from a family of wealthy American aristocrats with ""blue blood"" obsessions as opposed to regular folks.  The heroine doesn't have a single relative with a Euro phenotype who can make an appearance to the in-laws.  The heroine is fearful of the ""black baby throwback"" myth (a genetic impossibility in her case).  There is a disturbing scene on the dance floor in which the writer seems to be implying that the heroine's love of dance and dancing skills are somehow related to her ""Negro blood.""  The heroine allows her husband to think that her ridiculous fear of a ""black baby"" means that she was unfaithful to him.  He does not deduce that his wife has mixed ancestry.

Movies like this never point out that Hispanics, Arab-Americans, Melungeons, Lumbees, etc. totally ignore the stigma and open secret of their partial African ancestry with total impunity.  If this is admitted, the racist ""lesson"" of the film looks like the racist idiocy that it truly is.
