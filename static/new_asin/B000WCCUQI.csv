8222501,5,B000WCCUQI,The movie Glory Road inspired me to buy this.  I love the true story movie and I love this orignal footage that is nostalgic for more than one reason.,1444780800,,150,4.172413793103448
8222502,5,B000WCCUQI,"I saw this game on TV at the time it was played but didn't realize the social significance.  I remember being impressed with the athleticism of Texas Western.  How could they have been such underdogs?  It was fun to see it again in its entirety.  Also, no commercials although it might have been fun to see the commercials on TV in 1966.",1432339200,,337,4.387096774193548

8222504,5,B000WCCUQI,"I was nine years old when my beloved TWC Miners beat Kentucky. We never realized what a huge milestone this was at the time. It was just our hometown team from El Paso, Texas in the spotlight on national TV. All we cared about is that we were national champions! Later, we learned what a monumental victory it was for the entire nation. Reliving this game again was such a heart-warming experience. I highly recommend getting the DVR and reliving it for yourself!",1305331200,2,463,4.590361445783133
