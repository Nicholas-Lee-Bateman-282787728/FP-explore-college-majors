1986801,1,B0001CNN4C,"The beach was a very scary place in the seventies. I remember being a kid when this movie came out and wanting to see it so badly. I've kept that reference in my head for about twenty years before I got ahold of a copy of this flick on ebay. it really is bad, but i make my friends watch it all the time. we especially like the scientist who states that this creature is "" still in the process of evolution.""
hmmm. i guess the rest of us are finished with that evolution stuff.

you'd pretty much be a fool for buying this, but then again, at times, it's almost bad enough to be funny. Too bad MST3K hasn't ever attacked this one.",1085702400,4,630,4.080645161290323

Certain images of the movie have been stuck on my mind for years, and some of the things that were said in the movie are still stuck on my mind. I still can't look at beaches without a certain image in my mind. I can't say what that is. If you haven't seen this movie, I won't spoil it for ya.",1383004800,2,435,3.6774193548387095
1986813,5,B0001CNN4C,"I had the old original VHS of the movie and copied it to a disc, and then sold the VHS tape on ebay. I would have been interested in this DVD had it been in widescreen, and cleaned up some. But, if it is full screen, I can't imagine it being much better than the copy I have. My copy from the VHS came out pretty decent, so I guess that will have to do for now. Don't pay this ridiculous price for the DVD if you want this movie. Buy a mint VHS copy, put it on a disc for yourself, and resell the VHS copy back after you have made your copy. It will be the same exact thing in quality and won't hardly cost you anything. 4.5 out of 5",1382054400,,633,3.7669172932330826

1986817,3,B0001CNN4C,"As with many an exploitation film, the promotional poster promises more than the film - any film, in fact - can realistically deliver, and Blood Beach is no exception. The image of a slender college-aged girl waste deep in sand with arms outstretched and a look of terror and pain on her face is certainly arresting. Even more interesting and certainly very shrewd is the tag line for the film, which piggy-backed on Jaws 2's marketing campaign that told audiences, ""Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water."" Blood Beach adds the line ""... you can't get there"". The intertextual strategy paid off so that Blood Beach's producers laughed all the way to the bank. The film lacks the drama of the poster and the satire of the tagline - despite it being unintentionally funny - but it has a lot going for it, such as a couple of surprise deaths that add a genuine sense of ubiquitous threat and danger. Complaints about the monster in other reviews are a little too pedantic, especially because the thrill of the film is not the monster, but what it does - how it dispatches its victims, which is so simple but very stylish. Sometimes I'm not sure if some viewers actually understand what exploitation films are about.",1375228800,6,1232,4.6045454545454545

1986821,5,B0001CNN4C,"I love Blood Beach. You don't see much of David Huffman, but I swear he had facial plastic surgery in the intervening years. Names more familiar to me are John Saxon as Captain Pearson and Burt Young as his sidekick Sergeant Royko, who loves to do things ""Chicago style"".
 I don't want to be a spoiler so nothing about the plot. It's fun and worth the watch.
 The disc itself is a studio rip as we are seeing more and more of these days. There is nothing technically wrong with it but it's definitely not remastered and likely never will be.",1367712000,3,541,4.346534653465347
1986822,5,B0001CNN4C,Blood beach rocks watched this when i was a kid and loved it. Found it on amazon bought it and watched it its still as good now as it was then.,1361664000,2,143,3.6451612903225805
1986823,3,B0001CNN4C,"This is basically a bad relationship movie that happens to have a sand monster in it.  Just terrible!  I would only recommend this to the most adventurous of bad horror connoisseurs.

In the opening scene an old lady is walking her dog on the beach and she is pulled into the sand by some ""thing.""  As she is pulled down screaming, before the release of Tremors (1990) by the way, her dog frantically barks for help.  A cat would have just watched her with contempt.  I'm just saying dogs are better pets in horror movies, that's all.  Moving on...

With the help of her ex-boyfriend, beach patrol man Harry, Catherine investigates her mother's disappearance.  It's been a while and there's still a spark there, but Harry is involved with someone else.  Luckily his girlfriend is eaten by the beach and he can devote his energy to Catherine, who he just learned is getting a divorce from her husband.

After racking up a decapitated dog, a mutilated woman and a castrated rapist, police captain Pearson (John Saxon; John Saxon; A Nightmare on Elm Street, Black Christmas, Tenebre) and Sgt. Royko (Burt Young; the Rocky series; Amityville II) are entertaining sea monster theories from their police scientist (Stefan Gierasch; Carrie, Spellbinder), who presents some pretty radical evolutionary theories about moving from sea to land and ""learning to walk"" considering he's never seen a specimen and his theories grow more insane later in the movie.

I'm guessing they put all the blood into the title because there is almost no blood in Blood Beach.  The gore isn't the only aspect of the movie that falls short.  The acting is weak (but that should come as no surprise), it drags along and the deaths are unexciting.  In fact, nothing about this movie was exciting.  People are being forcefully dragged to their doom and I'm watching waiting for something cool to happen...that should be the cool thing!!!!  Yet the victems behave like they're in quicksand.  And WAY too much attention is paid to Harry and Catherine's relationship, which is also painfully boring and got a LOT of screentime.  The most damning thing is that this movie featured the least exciting violent penis amputation in the history of film!  Such a scene typically comes with a wince, a gasp or even laughter (e.g., Piranha 3D and Piranha 3DD).

In the end they find the monster's lair and we see the beast. What a disappointment.  It's like an evil sunflower with a veiny scrotum for a body.  Monster-FAIL!

John Saxon was the only good thing about this movie.",1359244800,3,2534,4.825986078886311

Plot doesnt explain well how the things got there; didn't show enough nor long enough footage of this hydra looking monster-(seen only at very end). Its a drag it had to come back in many more 'lil live pieces shown at credits end. Average visual/audio quality. Not too bad a story or acting.

1986828,5,B0001CNN4C,"This film was one that I saw for the first time, when I was very very young and I never forgot it.  It sure entertained me when I was a child.  When I saw the movie again as a teen or young adult, I was a bit less impressed with it, but I still enjoyed it and the ""being unable to even REACH the water"" angle is still clever, in my opinion. Over all, I think its a decent flick for what it is, and it gave me some long-lasting pleasant memories, so I rate it a full 5 stars and I DO think its worth a peek, if you can rent it.  I would certainly buy it on DVD.",1224979200,2,560,3.65
1986829,4,B0001CNN4C,"I have this film. It was on the lineup of films on SHOWTIME,back when cable TV first came to my sleepy little town of Paradise,California in 1980. Of course science fiction classics like ""ALIEN""were in the lineup. But this one caught my eye.""JAWS""was a big box office draw. This was said to be a ripoff of that film. I liked it. I missed it when it came out on video. Another one was ""THE BOOGENS"".If these come out on DVD,I'll buy them. The newer fright flicks are too graphic.

  this movie about a monster that lives under the sand and attacks beach goers  is not just silly ,but stupid to boot. i still remember the tag line for it ""just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water, you can't get there""

8009961,1,B0001CNN4C,"There is no option here for zero stars, I would give it a negative if possible. You don't need wonder why this movie is rarely (never?) shown on late night TV !!  Fast forward to the last 10 minutes if you must see this, you will see the only appearance of the ""creature"" in the film (almost 30 seconds worth). I doubt that more than $10 was spent on the design....make that $5.  Do you yourself a BIG favor and rent ""TREMORS"" again....even if you've already seen it 100 times, it'll still be 100 times better than this monstrosity from  ""backyard movie productions"".  All you monster movie fans should go watch 1965 reruns of TV's ""Lost in Space"" for better acting, plots, monsters, and dialog. Seriously, we ALL have to ""smarten up"" in reading these  Amazon rating movie reviews, it's obvious none of these people who rate above one star actually watched the movie !!  ...and for the record, when did you EVER enjoy a movie with John Saxon in it ??!!",1461542400,,952,4.505813953488372

The quality is very poor and there isn't even a title menu associated with the pirated dvd.  I would not suggest purchasing and movies from this seller, used or new.  $20.00 or more for a pirated purchase that I could download online streaming for free is outrageous as well, especially considering the legality of the purchase.

8009964,4,B0001CNN4C,"what can you really say about blood beach (1980)?

john saxon again plays a cop, and again finds a way to do it differently, this time with an airy sarcasm that's just super appealing. the monster is essentially invisible till the end, which works fine, because this movie, this low budget piece of schlock, is built on...dialogue and relationships.

the dialogue in this movie is fascinating, poetic, cheesy, hysterical, flowery, and just downright bizarre, but never is it throwaway or boring. characters speculate on what's causing all of these disturbances, john saxon observes that ""just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water, you can't get there,"" guys with just hysterically insane hair wax poetic about the state of socal beaches and the good old days when you could watch the shadows get long. every word that comes out of the coroners mouth is to be savored.

and then you have the characters and their relationships! ex-flames get together, cops wrangle  for their constituents and people, friends help each other, people talk to one another. it's fascinating. burt young is on hand to be super insensitive, crass, and pragmatic. i wouldn't call this movie brilliant, but it's definitely a savant. big props go to writer-director jeffrey bloom for crafting a memorable, engaging tale, and to steven nalevansky for suggesting the story. great flick!

shout factory! acquire this gem and treat it proper, please!",1445299200,,1438,5.050632911392405

8009966,5,B0001CNN4C,"I haven't seen this movie in decades.  But it was something I vividly recalled and hoped to find on DVD one day.  That day is now.  Having just watched it, it's exactly as I remembered.  This is not your typical horror film.  There's something under the beach.  It grabs unsuspecting people and pulls them under.  There is no blood, no gore (despite the salacious illustration on the DVD cover).  It's really quite tidy, one moment there, gone the next.  The first to go, rather noisily, is an old woman.  The only witness is a shopping cart lady given to ominous portents but no real help.  When the police finally catch on to the fact that people have gone missing, is the beach closed?  No, it's dug up and set back again in perfect order.  For all the good that does.

Throughout, no matter what happens, there's never a sense of urgency.  But there is an overriding sense of melancholy.  That's part of the reason I like this movie so much, it's very nonchalant about the idea of a creature snatching passersby morning, noon, or nighttime.  No one gets overly excited; the danger is minimalized.  It's always business as usual.  John Saxon plays the captain in charge of dealing with the ""problem.""  Burt Young plays Sergeant Royko, a man given to wistful recollections about Chicago.  David Huffman plays Harry Caulder who loses one girlfriend only to quickly gain another (the daughter of the first victim and, as luck or plotting would have it, an old girlfriend he briefly considered marrying).  He's the only character even remotely interested in pursuing this mystery.  But he's in no hurry to solve it.  No one is.  It's all quite casual, dress or come as you are.

(On a sad note, actor David Huffman was murdered a few years after this movie was made.)",1384646400,8,1766,4.652597402597403
