7953530,5,B00005T7FZ,"With all due respect to todays NFL quarterbacks like the Mannings,Drew Breese, and Matt Ryan. The truth is most of the STARTERS today would be backups at best 15 or more years ago. Want to get a movie to provoke some real debates with the NOW generation grandpa? This DVD will give you difinitive proof that they had an OVERABUNDANCE of talented Quarterbacks way back when. Even 3rd. stringers in the 60's 70's and 80's would be stars today. The old Pittsburg steelers had 3 Great signal callers on the team at the same time. Terry Bradshaw,Jefferson Street Joe Gilliam,and Terry Hanratty. And according to Bradshaw himself HE WAS NOT THE BEST QB ON THAT TEAM. Think about that get the DVD and let the debates begin.",1351987200,,716,4.645669291338582

That said, I'd disagree with Mike and agree with Karl. In my opinion, if Bradshaw had played in the 80s instead of the 70s Bradshaw's numbers would have been more like Marino's because of the rule changes that opened up the passing game. Bradshaw was also better than Marino because he won the big games under his leadership and guidance not because he threw the ball on nearly every down like Marino.  For that matter I think Bob Griese was a better Dolphin QB than Marino. 2 Super Bowl rings. 3 Super Bowls in a row. 1 perfect season. That's leadership! Consider how different the rules and game was during Bradshaw and Grieses era compared to Marino. The old AFL rules didn't get implemented adn open up the passing game until the late 70's. Outlawing certain defenses, no bumping the receiver after 5 yards, strict roughing the passer rules, everything designed to open up the passing game. He was by far a better leader than Marino. Sure the Steelers had more talent, not to mention that hall of fame coach Chuck Noll was equal to that of his former teammate and mentor Don Shula. Not every Steeler victory was a blowout. They had several close games where one play would have changed history and the Steelers teams of the 70s would not be held in such high regard as they are today.",1117497600,,1449,4.565384615384615
7953532,5,B00005T7FZ,One of the Many things that I always enjoy so much about sports is Debates upon placements of Players.for Me if you are considered Great then you can be anywhere from 1-50 or 1-100. because when you are Considered Great that alone puts you into Elite company. I dig all the QB's Mentioned.glad Jim Kelly got madd Props though.,1094947200,,326,4.5423728813559325
7953533,5,B00005T7FZ,"Karl if check this site out, it will provide concrete evidence of what Kim Carter is saying:  [...]
Dan Marino does deserve a high rating, I don't think he is #1 however, there are better quarterbacks than Dan Marino, such as Steve Young, the highest quarterback rating ever in history.  But Dan Marino I believe is definitely in the top 10.  And is also by far, one of my most favoriate quarterbacks to ever play the game!!  This DVD rules!  Get it sports fans!",1070928000,,462,4.4523809523809526
7953534,4,B00005T7FZ,"I loved the game footage on this DVD. However, I had a problem with some of the QB ratings. I wholeheartedly agree with Joe Montana being the undisputed number 1 quarterback. Where I disagree with the ratings is when they rank non-Superbowl winning QBs such as Dan Marino and Jim Kelly so high. I simply can't believe Dan Marino is ranked ahead of Terry Bradshaw! This is pure foolishness. Otherwise, a nice NFL films product.",1065571200,,426,4.693333333333333
