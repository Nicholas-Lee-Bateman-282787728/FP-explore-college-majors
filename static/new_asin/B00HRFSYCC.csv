6200356,4,B00HRFSYCC,"Dont let the title fool you; this is not a new addition to the AMERICAN PIE franchise, nor is it the suggested title for the next HANGOVER film.  BUCK WILD is a rowdy, darkly humorous venture into zombie-comedy territory, filled with gore and goofs alike.  And while it is not perfect, it is a lot of fun and certainly worthy of attention.

As Ive mentioned in previous posts, I love horror-comedies.  Im always fascinated to see how humor can be interjected into some of horrors most popular and intense concepts.  And because Im a huge zombie fan, finding humor with them makes a film that much better.

BUCK WILD is shot well for the most part and looks good onscreen.  There are a couple of camera shots that made me raise an eyebrow and wonder why that particular spot was chosen; but otherwise, the cinematography is pretty solid.  Likewise, the acting is good, too.  I particularly like the diversity of the cast.  Director Tyler Glodt did a great job in casting the four primary characters, and each actor is to be commended in their roles.  They are an over-the-top bunch with larger than life personas, but that works perfectly in a film like this.

The special effects are mostly well done, and theres plenty of gore to go around.  From mutilated animals to gunshot blood-sprays, we get a nice dose of carnage onscreen.  I say the effects are mostly well done because some of the zombie effects looked a bit cheap.  The close-up shots look greatbut there are several background zombies that barely look made up at all.  I figured this was due to budget constraints, but it was noticeable enough to bring up.

Despite its small flaws, BUCK WILD is entertaining and funny.  The characters are boisterous and full of life, which injects a lot of energy into this production.  I recommend giving the film a look if you're looking for off-the-wall fun and zany, gory comedy.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1395619200,,1932,4.659763313609467
6200357,4,B00HRFSYCC,"This movie is pretty freakin' weird. And when I say weird, I mean a British guy in a feather boa who has a reality hunting show in Texas weird. You've also got a tramp that wants to run away to New Mexico. A psychopath from New York who may or may not have killed a bunch of people. A Matthew McConaughey wannabe ladies man who steals everyone's girlfriend and a neurotic guy in incredible shape who is constantly losing his clothes...and the list goes on. Needless-to-say, it's campy as hell and at first I was a little put off but then it all kinda grew on me.

It's basically about 3 friends and a nutcase cousin who go on a hunting trip and a Chupacabra starts a zombie virus. It's standard comedy fare...they get separated and have to rely on each other to make it out alive. They also deal with their own issues throughout the ordeal.

It's not really that scary but I don't think it's supposed to be. It's definitely more comedy than zombie but still had some great kills. There aren't any names in the movie except for Joe Stevens who was my favorite. Some of the gags are a little too over-the-top for my taste (again with the camp) but I laughed out loud several times.

Overall, it's pretty entertaining and worth a watch if you're in the mood to see something weirdly humorous.",1395273600,,1289,4.407563025210084

6200360,5,B00HRFSYCC,"Great movie, one of the better zombie movies I've watched, with a few good laughs thrown in

I am recommending this movie to all my friends.",1395187200,,140,4.384615384615385
6200361,4,B00HRFSYCC,"I originally was going to give this a 3 star rating because to me it was just an entertaining movie that I didn't really think too much about.  HOWEVER, after giving it a little thought, I decided to up it to a 4 because I can honestly see myself going back and rewatching it numerous times.  It does seem to be the type of movie that, when watched multiple times, gets funnier and funnier each time.  I really hope this ends up on TBS or some sort of station, because people that probably wouldn't give it the time of day might sit and watch it.  It really is a funny movie the more I think about it!

For starters, DO NOT go by the IMDB summary.  That is the first (and probably) only time I will ever say that, as I love IMDB.  However, their summary makes the movie seem like an all out horror/thriller.  It's not.  That's one thing that confused me when I started to watch it.  I was under the impression that I was watching a serious indie, horror, flick and as soon as the first scene ended, I was slightly confused.  This IS more a comedy than anything (in my opinion).  But again, with so many of the same type movies out, it's good for a change of pace.

The story follows 3 friends: Craig (Matthew Albrecht), Lance (Isaac Harrison), and Tom (Dru Lockwood) along with Craig's cousin, Jerry (Jarrod Pistilli) on their hunting trip to Buck Wild Ranch.  Honestly, if not for Jerry, I probably wouldn't have continued watching this movie.  But his comedy timing was perfect and kept me interested in finding out what he was going to do next.  Upon entering town, they meet up with local, self-proclaimed ""badass"", Billy Ray (Mark Ford).  This guy, I actually know some guys who could be him, so I was pretty entertained in his character.  Either way, this is the first time you really get the sense of how Jerry is and why the other 2 guys didn't want him to come along.

After arriving they encounter the ranch's owner, Clyde (Joe Stevens) and his daughter, Candy (Meg Cionni).  It's apparent something is wrong with Clyde (dealing with the movies opening scene), but the guys chalk it up as his personality.  That night, Craig reveals his intentions to marry his girlfriend of six years, Carla.  This causes Lance to get uncomfortable and rush off and leads Isaac to reveal that Carla is cheating on Craig with Lance.  He even has pictures to prove it.

This pretty much sets up the movie and I must say, I don't want to spoil anymore because it has some REALLY funny scenes throughout.  So if you're in the mood to get a good laugh while being (somewhat) grossed out, this movie is perfect for you!

Final Verdict:  RENT IT!  It's good for a laugh.

6200362,4,B00HRFSYCC,"Mild mannered Craig (Matthew Albrecht) leads a group of his buddies buck hunting at the Buck Wild ranch in south Texas. The group includes his skirt chasing BFF Lance (Isaac Harrison) who is also friends with Craig's girlfriend Carla. Tom is the third member of this group. He is not an outdoors type and his manhood is in constant question by Texans. Jerry (Jarrod Pistilli) is the stranger. He is Craig's visiting cousin from New York. He has with him a duffel bag which he guards. He also has an encyclopedia knowledge of the Chupacabra, the topic of many bad horror films and something we saw before the opening credits. Clearly he has plans of his own as Clyde's (Joe Stevens) ranch has had reported sightings.

The rival ranch is run by self proclaimed bad a**  Billy Ray (Mark Ford) who wears a boa and is apparently British (accent and flag in home).  The film doesn't give you any odd twists. The characters are what makes the film an enjoyment to watch. The Chupacabra bite turns people into zombies. It is a virus that causes people to commit ""violent acts against loved ones, friends, and church goers."" Once zombies are sated with meat, they calm down, can watch TV, and even speak.

Movie Guy nomination for ""The best zombie psychologist scene"" in comedy or horror.

4 star low budget ""B"" film.

6200363,5,B00HRFSYCC,My wife and I like to take chances on unknown films once in a while so we rolled the dice on Buck WIld and it came up a winner! Felt like we were getting in on the ground floor of a cult classic. Lots of surprise laughs by a fresh faced cast. Well written script with classic tag lines... made for a great movie night! highly recommended,1392681600,,337,4.044776119402985
6200364,4,B00HRFSYCC,I love scary movies. I personally would not call this so much a horror movie as a dark comedy. Its is well done and well acted for a low budget horror flick give it a try!!,1390867200,,172,3.8055555555555554
6200365,1,B00HRFSYCC,"I have watched a lot of bad low budget zombie movies in my time as a zombie fan, but this film is one of the worst.  I don't know who thought this was a good idea to film this or that anyone at all would like it, but they were terribly misinformed!

***SPOILERS***

This film has horrible editing, the acting is about as believable as a 5th grade school play, and the actors themselves have about as much passion for their roles as people on C-SPAN have during a filibuster.  The only good part of the movie was the character, ""Billy Ray,"" his character made me laugh a few times and his outfit was pretty hilarious.

As far as the zombies themselves, their make-up is terrible, the blood is so obviously fake that it's pathetic, and the actors playing these zombies have like zero talent.  Seriously it looked like they just put up an open casting call and took anyone who showed up and threw some fake blood on them and said, ""Okay, you're a zombie now.  Get on camera and walk around stiffly and growl.""

And the zombies themselves don't make sense.  At one point they are mindless flesh eating monsters, and another they are driving cars, playing banjos, talking and basically giving therapy sessions.  Unless your zombies are going to say, ""Braaaaiiinnns!"" They should NOT be talking!

***END SPOILERS***

All in all, this movie is terrible.  The dialogue is stupid, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are a joke!  Avoid this movie at all costs!",1415404800,,1463,4.598455598455598

6200368,3,B00HRFSYCC,"this is a very low budget film. In fact they barely had enough money to do muck in the way of make up even. It's a zomedy , which is part comedy and such. The gore factor is not so high on this one due to budget restraints.  It's shot in widescreen at least though! And it looks really good on blu ray.  Basically , four guys go hunting in texas and a zombie plague breaks out. They have to deal with a british bad guy as well.  This features lots of shooting with not so much blood!  And the whole thing is over the top for sure.  This does have a few funny moments but not enough to be full on comedy.  Of course because it's a zomedy the characters act stupid , which is what you would expect too.  It's not too bad,  but it's a very low budgeter.  It's silly enough for kids to watch even.",1407888000,,793,3.9371069182389937

To my surprise, we all laughed through the whole thing! Cute actors with funny lines and an original, oddball assortment of characters. I think Tom's disappearing clothing is my favorite character. So funny, like a cartoon. I rarely watch movies more than once, other than a few classics, but I would actually watch this again, because like another reviewer said, it's one that I think gets funnier every time you watch it.",1401148800,,682,4.5528455284552845

The acting was just as good as some I've seen in the big budget films and perhaps a propos of nothing but the actors were just as hot as well.  These guys might be all related but they certainly portrayed uniquely individual styles.  Kudos!  One criticism of the acting (spoiler alert)...the line the cafe's waitress delivers when the zombies walk in...writing was HILARIOUS...delivery completely killed a GREAT line. I hope these people continue, I see potential.",1483833600,,619,4.80188679245283

This is designed as a sort of zombie-comedy movie.  The front cover looks like it could be abysmal.  It is directed by Tyler Glodt, almost a first-time director, but he has prior credit for The Possession and one subsequent I could find, for Stray.  The cast are also virtual unknowns: 3 Albrechts, Joe Canik, Meg CianiI could go on.  It wouldnt help you.  Music by Joel Thompson [one Taylor Thompson is an actress here.  Related?  I cant say].  It is filmed entirely in Texas.

This did not get great reviews.  Probably it did not get much advertising and people were unsure what to expect if they watched it.
Certain plot elements are never explained.  But then, if you are traveling from the Big Apple to rural Texas for a hunting trip, would you know everything that was going on?  I doubt it

How violent is it?  Moderately violent.  You cant do a righteous zombie movie with no violence.  It was not excessively gory.  How much nudity?  I cant exactly remember, but that is not really a focus either.  I have to say, sexual cavorting is definitely part of the comedy though.

Is this more comedy or parody, or horror film?  I would say: yes.  It pretty well equally mixes them.  Naturally it has to do some homage to prior films in the zombie genre, and the writers must also have been impressed by the Godfather series, as they specifically mention it in the course of the script.  There's also a clear call-back to ""Deliverance"" and probably some other films as well.

There was nothing too fancy in cinematography or special effects.  And unfortunately at the moment, the musical score isn't coming back to my mind.

I ended up pleasantly entertained by this movie.  If you a) enjoy ANY zombie movies, and b) enjoy parodies based on them, then I think you will like this.  You will also get a look at some off-Broadway talent.",1467676800,,1871,4.581818181818182
