8349741,5,B0023AHPSA,"I have the privilege to have a professional Square Dancer in my church.  Her dancing days were after WWII so it's been awhile but listening to her stories you can tell she loved to dance. After seeing the Traveling Hoedowners on Youtube I knew I hit paydirt because they know how to do it right!.  After getting the Party she was in tears of joy!!!

The speed of the shipment was very fast and I was surprised to see my package in the mailbox.

The Square Dance party pack is great because you can listen to the caller and music or watch the DVD's and see the awesome dancers.  Great price for what you get thanks Traveling Hoedowners",1248307200,5,634,4.338983050847458
