8689976,5,B00Q0DEEBC,As a previous buyer of Tony Helsloot's videos I must say this one knocks it out of the park!  There are so many various Christmas-themed videos included in this 2 disc set. I love the fireplace as well as the winter snow scenes and the fireworks. I was amazed at how relaxing the candle video was. Very tranquil and perfect to unwind to after a stressful day. My only disappointment was the Christmas Decorations video.  I personally didn't care for it altho it was filmed beautifully.  I just would've preferred a different location. Other than that I thought the entire collection was artfully done as are all his videos...and the various array of choices of views and sound/music was excellent. Great job Tony and kudos to you and your crew for another beautiful video collection!  I'll cherish this one as much as I do the others of yours in my collection.,1480032000,,860,4.675496688741722
8689977,5,B00Q0DEEBC,"A colorful HD set of DVDs for the holidays and any time you feel like celebrating.  This is a great set from the World Nature Videos DVDs/Tony  Helsloot.  The fireworks DVD is like actually being there.  There is four different high color HD displays with either music or realistic sounds of fireworks. There is one display that features the lovely Blue Danube Waltz during the display.  This would be great for New Year's Eve as background for a party or for your own July 4th display.
I love the Christmas DVD and it is my absolute favorite.  I own several Christmas DVDs.  However, none have the HD colorful displays or the variety that this DVD does.  It is everything Christmas from the colorful lights to glowing candles.  There is relaxing winter wonderland scenery complete with falling snow.  There is some fireworks, a beautiful Christmas fireplace, and plenty of Christmas displays, decorations and even some relaxing candles.  This would be great for someone who cannot get out for the holidays, as a background during a party or just to get you in the mood for the holidays.",1431129600,4,1087,4.790322580645161

8689979,5,B00Q0DEEBC,"The 2 DVDs in this set are very different, and as such I'm reviewing them separately.

The first DVD is the Christmas one. The only thing in the whole DVD that I didn't particularly care for was the first film which contained a lot of Christmas figures. I'm just not in to all the Christmas figurines - just my preference. But there are many other beautiful sections to this DVD. I especially like the 2 different candle films with the peaceful music. I love candles and have many of them, but it's different watching the candles burn on a large screen. Very calming. Then there is the fireplace film, also really enjoyable. I liked the snow scenes video too. But my favorite of all is a section called Natural Decoration. It contains a Snowy Creek film, but my absolute favorite of all is called Glitters. It's a lake at night with sparkly lights shining off the water. I love it.

The Fireworks DVD has very vivid colors in the fireworks. The DVD is very easy to navigate with a lot of options - the different films are labeled nicely so you know exactly which one you're going to play. The music is varied too. My personal favorite was the Orchestral music - Blue Danube. There are also shorter and longer individual videos on this DVD. Very well organized.  I'm not really into the music usually associated with fireworks, I prefer just to watch and marvel at all the shapes and colors of the display.

All in all, it's a great set and a really good price!",1417564800,10,1460,4.477443609022556
