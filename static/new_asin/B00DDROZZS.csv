5792988,5,B00DDROZZS,"I love American Horror Story. When I got these DVD's they were in good condition. Like most cheap DVDs on Amazon the case was not in perfect condition. I don't really care, the desk work perfectly and inside of the case it was really pretty there was no scratches and overall it was presentable. I love American Horror Story so much that even though the cases damage it doesn't matter to me. As long as the discs work its 5.",1388966400,,424,4.3125
5792989,5,B00DDROZZS,"I recently started watching this series on Netflix. I can't quit watching it. I found myself watching for 12 hours until each season was completed. This show blows any other horror series out of the water. It is an excellent mix of Stephen King type horror mixed with Saw franchise horror. Just watch 3 episodes, and you will never want to quit.",1388534400,,345,4.580645161290323

5793000,2,B00DDROZZS,"The violence and cruelty and indifference represented in this series is appalling and unwatchable.  I really hate this show but I think it might be an emotional exercise in forcing us to see what it would be like for people to be at the ""mercy"" of brutal crazy killers and no one saves them and they stay dead.

Why do we need to feel crapped up by this?  Maybe because as a society, we have an empathy/comprehension gap.

This show is really horrifying.  Nurses getting killed. Jessica Lange always so mean like some prison camp guard not caring how you feel but feeling sorry for herself and pretty slattish.

Very scary ugly show - not recommended - but probably for a purpose since this is so intensely and expertly crafted.

I guess we have to know what it was like for people who actually suffered something similarly hopeless and unfair because we can refer to this viewing experience when we read news about actual historical injustices.

""They're hurting us.""  is very often the SOS message sent to the outside world in many works of fiction such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000BW7QWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Well ....

The response to that is ""Why We Fight.""

Because this show never has the cavalry coming to the rescue and that was the everyday of WW2 until the cavalry DID come to the rescue and stop the bad guys so this is the reality - this is when nobody comes for you and you don't deserve it and the bad guys win and its as if the universe cannot be right if these terrible things can happen.

So in order to survive, we compartmentalize but we can still be trained to react with the commitment to correct and to condemn thwarting those who want us to have collective amnesia - as if we were in an insane asylum and Dr. Arden ne' Gruper formerly of the SS applied electroshock ""therapy"" to make us forget ...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Those-Who-Trespass-Against-Us-One-Woman-s-War-Against-the-Nazis/dp/1844134172/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Those Who Trespass Against Us: One Woman's War Against the Nazis</a>.",1402185600,,2198,5.391812865497076

5793007,5,B00DDROZZS,"<Amber K> Review for American Horror Story. For this review I would like to talk about one of my favorite television shows that airs on FX Wednesdays nights at 9 p.m. American Horror Story is a very unique show, each season has a different theme, and a different story line, they use the same actors to play different characters each season. I think the creators have come up with a very innovative way to keep people interested, and to expand their audience base each season. The best part about this show is that you do not have to watch previous seasons to be able to watch the newest season. Each season is completely different story, hence the title, American Horror Story. The creators of this series really hit the jackpot with the way they decided to create this series. I love that you don't have to follow every season to be a fan. If you like horror storys you will love this show. This show is a great addition to our vampire-loving zombie crazed pop culture.
The first season is called American Horror Story: Murder House. This season is follows a family that moves into a haunted Hollywood mansion that is haunted by its former occupants. The storyline is centered on the infamous Murder House, and each episode introduces different occupants that lived in the house in different decades, from the first occupants in the early 1900s to the recent occupants that owned the house before the newest occupants. This was a great first season that really sets the tone for the show.
The second season is called American Horror Story: Asylum. Based in the 1960s, this season follows the stories of the patients, staff, and visitors of Briarcliff, an institution for the criminally insane that is organized and run by the Catholic church. This is one of my favorite seasons so far. Some really twisted events and characters take part in this season. I thought this season was one of the scariest seasons thus far. One the scariest characters in this season is the institutions newest hire, a physiatrist who has buffalo bill tendencies.
The third season is called American Horror Story: Coven. This season takes place in the 1800s to present day and follows the lives of witches, witch hunters, voodoo practitioners, and all the supernatural phenomenon that comes with coven territory. This is definitely a feminine season. The storyline follows the lives of female witches throughout history and all of the struggles that they have faced as outcasts of American society. This is definitely a season has the underlying theme of female empowerment.",1392681600,2,2553,4.8577981651376145

5793009,5,B00DDROZZS,"I really loved the first set of Am. Horror! That was great. The Asylum kind of let me down. Although it was still good and I enjoyed it, I guess I just expected more.
