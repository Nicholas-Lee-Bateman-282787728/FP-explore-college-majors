- Synopsis: The protagonist of the show, Kazami Yuuji has been detained for suspected involvement with a terrorist group. Their leader, Heath Oslo, manages to enter Japan's borders with a weapon of mass destruction.

Meanwhile, at Mihama Academy, the rest of the students are alerted that due to financial problems, the school is set to close within the month. The girls feel a great deal of gratitude towards Yuuji for all he has done for them over the year. Knowing he wouldn't want them to be involved in something dangerous, they enact a plan to steal him back. Even though the odds are against them, as well as mounting pressure, they aren't going to let a handicap prevent them from rescuing their precious friend.

Yuuji's friends will be carrying out a harrowing mission that will jeopardize their lives. However, they resolve themselves that this time, it's their turn to help out. While Yuuji is being used as an intricate game piece in a political game, he has already accepted his fate. But he doesn't realize that a rescue party will be coming for him...

- Comments: I found this portion of the series much more interesting than the first one. While it wasn't bad, the first season had some scenes that were a bit disturbing. Not only that, with how skilled and experienced the main character was, it was starting to get boring watching him defeat his opponents. It was constantly like watching a one-sided slaughter. So, it was very refreshing watching the other characters take the center stage in this season.

Additionally, he was so detached and emotionless that it just made the anime seem stale. Like a teacher speaking in a monotone while they lecture the class. He also reminds me of Tatsuya from The Irregular at Magic High School. I also disliked some similar things in that anime. They are pretty much both one-man-armies. Which is cool, but gets monotonous rather quickly.

- Conclusion: Other than that, the amount of psychology, philosophy, and other thought-provoking concepts were addressed in this anime. As such, this anime would probably appeal more to a mature audience that appreciates dialogue-heavy animes with plenty of exposition. I just feel that the anime would have been more appealing if the main character displayed more emotion and wasn't so over-powered. As that made the anime stagnate at times.

- Features: Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 10 episodes on 2 Blu-rays with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence, language, and sexual content.

8761853,4,B01FZ8OA3E,"My first DVD ""The labyrinth of Grisaia"" worked perfectly in my older Blue Ray player. However when it came running the "" Eden..."" DVD my player didn't realize the disk was there. I had a similar problem the Blue Ray disks from "" Mikagura School Suite..."" which I also bought. My Blue Ray player was four plus years old, so I bought a new one, a Sony for  $65.00, and this fixed the problem.",1476403200,,390,4.27027027027027
