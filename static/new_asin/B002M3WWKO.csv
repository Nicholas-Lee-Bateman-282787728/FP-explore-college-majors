8373515,5,B002M3WWKO,"A really good discussion about the inner and outer journey of the hero. Mr Hauge and Mr Vogler each have something to bring to the subject. With both of them, the watcher gets really thorough coverage of the subject.",1515456000,,216,4.564102564102564
8373516,1,B002M3WWKO,"This video is a mind masher--it takes things apart and MICRO analyses them into sheer obscurity. USELESS.
ANY story needs a good character in hard conditions and growth and change as they deal with whatever IT is. Something people can relate and feel and laugh and cry with.
A shy Harry Potter who rises thru all adversity.

SIMPLE. This DVD? Tries to make it a scientific gross anatomy parade thru endless terminology, charts and ridiculous blather.

I STARTED TO WATCH THIS AND GOT SO BORED I NEVER WENT BACK TO FINISH IT. NUFF SAID.",1415836800,,535,4.680851063829787
8373517,5,B002M3WWKO,"Michael Hague is one of the best instructors on story structure. If you want to really get how to write a terrific novel or screenplay, you need to watch this series and listen to the additional audio CD. So much of what I teach and apply in writing my own novels comes from his method and has changed the way I structure my novels. I recommend this to all my editing clients, and feel it is one of the most essential concepts about story one can learn.",1398902400,,453,4.218390804597701
8373518,5,B002M3WWKO,"At Agile Writers I used this video to create a system for helping beginning novelists create a first-draft novel in 6 months. Our system is different from, but based upon Hauge and Vogler's teachings.

If you have never written a large work (novel of 250 pages, for example) the lectures in this video series will be eye-opening. At Agile Writers we've completed 20 first-draft novels, two of which were nominated for Best Unpublished Novel by the James River Writers.

If you are an accomplished writer, then you won't be surprised by a lot of the advice in this video. What Hauge and Vogler have done is taken the elements of story and broken it down into digestible chunks. Not everyone is a world-class writer. But if you aspire to be one, you can't do better than to start with Hauge and Vogler as your mentors.",1370131200,,816,4.620689655172414
8373519,5,B002M3WWKO,"If you're a writer at any level, you can and should learn from this. These are can-do tips about the inner and the outer hero's journey. This is how hit novels and hit movles are written, and no less than Disney takes advice from these two script doctors.",1358726400,,255,4.333333333333333
8373520,5,B002M3WWKO,"I must say, this is a really great DVD, a must, indeed, for anyone interesting in writing story, whatever the media it is for.
Hauge and Vogler are really knowledgeable writers, and great teachers who share very clearly their secrets, using exemples from movies and stories we all know, so it's really easy to acquire the ideas presented.
For non native-english speaking people, it is missing subtitles, but honestly, it is no problem, they are very articulate and understandable.",1354406400,,480,5.0886075949367084
8373521,1,B002M3WWKO,"Making something so clear as the Greek three act story structure into an unwieldy beast is the only thing to be had from this convoluted DVD product.  I have dozens of books on writing, the craft, plotting, etc.  I thought, rather than traveling to a course, the forty buck investment in this DVD might be worthwhile.  I was wrong.

Six levels, inner and outer character, and on and on.  Pie graphs and charts and convoluted nomenclature -- in the end, there is literally nothing of value for the storyteller (scriptwriter, novelist, etc) in this DVD set.  It's useless.

Many writers --Stephen King, Joyce Carole Oates, Ann Beattie, and the like -- have stated many times over that the key to storytelling is to make compelling characters who draw emotion from readers by being placed in escalating conflict and eventually coming to a satisfying conclusion, which involves change on the part of the main character.  That's it.  These (and other) famous novelists have all said the same thing, some on youtube videos waiting for you to discover them right now.  I should have taken what they say to heart.

The lecturers on this DVD truly do over-explain, over analyze the generic, formulaic and stock Hollywood script, citing many examples that we've all heard of before (The Firm, etc.) and know to be status quo movie fodder, and the almost compulsively break it down into tiny, useless morsels that will no more help you write a captivating storyline than  it will take out your garage to the curbside.

I did give one star to the speakers voice, well spoken, clear, even if the visual recording of this is dicey and amateurish.  I found this DVD set, as an avid writer and reader, to be, as we used to call the ""science"" of sociology: the empiric determination of the obvious.

Let's not make a formula out of something that is natural.  Read again what I write above -- the one line from the great authors about what a story should be -- and then get clicking on the typewriter.  That is the essence of this mind-numbing lecture DVD.  Save your money.  I wish I had.",1308528000,15,2072,4.6740331491712706
