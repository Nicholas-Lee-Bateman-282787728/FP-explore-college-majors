5254445,4,B0093BUW2I,It is painful to see and know that innocent and defenseless girls and other victims being sold and forced into prostitution globally. Human trafficking indeed remains increased even though victims are rescued from time to time. This movie is highly recommendable for viewers who need to know the ugly truth about human trafficking. It is surprising to see actress and activist Mira Sorvino playing in another movie about child slavery and prostitution.,1357776000,,452,5.291666666666667

It stirs something deep inside you by bringing light to the oppression of innocent children in Cambodia and all over the world.  5 stars, two thumbs up.... Definitely the best movie I have seen concerning the subject of human trafficking yet.",1356998400,17,322,4.944444444444445
5254449,5,B0093BUW2I,"Definitely a touching, poignant and heart wrenching story. The sad part of it all, is that it's not fiction.

5254463,5,B0093BUW2I,"Don't know where to start. . . . This is not a movie that lets you escape. It's a necessary but painful vision of what is happening too often in SE Asia, and around the world, too.  I kept wanting to turn it off because the subject matter is too ugly, but the film is well made and realistic and engaging.  Good thing this film wasn't saturated w/ all those Hollywood megastars, because they'd for sure messed it up w/ their over acting.
It's too bad that such horrible and evil deeds have to be in a film or book for most people to know how ugly this world can be.  Not too long ago, right after 4/30/1975, when hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese boat people made their escape from communism, Thai pirates flooded the South China Sea and unleashed their rape, robbery, murder, and kidnapping.  Unknown to most or all of westerners who vacation in Thailand, especially in their big cities, there were, and most likely still are, victims of that decade old crime, pleasing and serving the western tourists.

Another uncomfortable thought each time this topic surfaces is the fact that such industry wouldn't exist if there no demand for it.  If anyone has ever known any man or group of men traveling to SE Asia, or any poor countries, especially for fun, one cannot help but think there has to be a reason beyond simply the natural beauty or food of such places.  Sad and sick, but mostly true.  As in most crimes or corruptions, it seems so simple to just follow the money.  But like most crimes and corruptions, the true question is, who, with such money, are in the ranks of government and business leaders, that have the demand for that industry?

There are no laws or science that can set the evil breed of pedophiles right.  They don't belong in the human race.  At the minimum, permanent castration should be mandatory.  Extinction should be the norm for that filth.",1475625600,3,1874,4.558208955223881

5254468,5,B0093BUW2I,Human trafficking is an international epidemic.  This movie does a decent job of sharing glimpses of the horrific events that occur to so many of the innocent.

5254481,2,B0093BUW2I,"I never really bought into this movie.  Normally I'd give it 3 or 4 stars just because Mira Sorvino stars in it.  It's about very, very young Cambodian girls who are enslaved as prostitutes in Cambodia.  They are either abducted, bought in exchange of debts, or bullied into the brothel.  Pretty bleak stuff.  What I couldn't ever quite figure out was the role of the American guy (Mira's husband) who seemed to be in charge of getting the girls out of the brothel.  He seemed in charge of the local Cambodian police force, but I never understood his authority.  He seemed part do-gooder.  And part government official with some government authority over the police.  At the most tense moments, it was clear that he didn't carry a gun, yet he seemed in charge of the whole Cambodian SWAT team.  Mira plays his wife.  But also seemed to have no jurisdictional power over anyone or anything.  Yet she seemed to have plenty of involvement.  What was she doing there anyway?

Human Trafficking is possibly the worst abomination happening in the world today and little is being done to stop it!  This is partly due to a lack of awareness and the fact that most of the people involved are , unfortunately, in positions of power. That's why we need to have films, be they true, documentaries or even fiction, to bring THIS to the forefront of everyone. It needs to be addressed and hopefully if people write, protest or take action, in some form, it will make a difference.

The ""easiest"" thing to do is to keep quiet about what one sees, hears or thinks. So pathetic. Very sad. People deserve better than this kind of treatment & abuse.

The movie made me want to help those girls and be an advocate to help stop the injustice that these young girls face.

The brutality wrought upon these children was barely shown. The nefariousness of the dealers was velvet-gloved. Without the confluence of these two forces, the power of the narrative was never compelling. Confuse and dilute that with a maudlin side story, and you're left relatively unmoved. This subject should not be regarded as ""entertainment"" but, if made into a fictionalized film, should be much more informative and pernicious. This is a subject better left to documentaries.

A more illuminating exposition is ""The Whistleblower"" with Rachael Weisz. 3*.
""Taken""?...read my review. ""Trade"" or ""Human Trafficking"" are better than this reviewed feature.

Decades ago a number of well educated young ladies assisted me (in my work in refugee camps) who had been Vietnamese boat people/refugees and been captured at sea by Thai pirates/fishermen.

5254610,5,B0093BUW2I,"Human trafficking is one of those dirty not so secret crimes that proliferate across the world. The very sleaziness of the topic also unfortunatly tends to rub off on films that dramatize it. Mira Sorvino has twice played an anti-trafficking agent, once in TRAFFICKING and once again in TRADE OF INNOCENTS. In this latter film she is married to Dermot Mulroney, an American free-lancer living in Cambodia, both of whom are determined to cut into the vicious trading of child prostitution. One of the reviewers saw the film as more sleaze itself than as an honest look at a world wide problem. TRADE OF INNOCENTS is far more than a slimmed down TV movie of the weak. It shows much of the drama from the vantage of those most involved: the victims, the pedophiles, and the pimps. Into this mix comes Mira Sorvino, whose own child was kidnapped years earlier, thus giving her the needed emotional resonance to fight on to save other children. Actor John Billingsley (from Star Trek Enterprise) plays against type as a leering pedophile. In a film filled with many moments of power, one stood out. Dermot Mulroney is trying to ascertain if the local police would be willing to stamp out the trade even if it means cutting into the flow of incoming tourist dollars. The local police captain is openly scornful of Mulroney's ability to make a dent. Mulroney responds by noting that all grand movements begin with a dent. TRADE OF INNOCENTS may be dramatically gimmicked up but once you get involved, the only gimmick is to measure how much of humanity remains in your soul.",1364601600,,1567,4.743589743589744

After watching it, I wondered if somehow I just happened to watch a different film by the same name and with the same actors because this film is terrible.  First, the entire affair looks like it was shot in the safe confines of a studio and comes across feeling more like a soap opera than a serious film.  Additionally, the characters are so incredibly simple.  Either they are super-good or super-evil and come across as being merely glossy comic book characters in a stereotypical pulp publication..  There are more complex characters in the Sunday morning comics strips.  To top it off, the acting was terrible.  Maria Sorvino cries like a teenage girl who discovers her crush likes someone else as opposed to someone actually concerned with these victims.

Granted, this film does bring to light the plight of children in the sex slave trade.  However, even noble intentions cannot make up for incredibly inept film-making.

5254621,5,B0093BUW2I,"I was amazed to see Mira Sorvino in this film since she had also starred in another show on human trafficking, a Showtime drama titled Human Trafficking several years ago. In Trade of Innocents, she plays Claire Becker the wife of Alex Becker (Dermot Mulroney) who is working with an organization that is out to eradicate human trafficking in Cambodia, particularly child sexual trafficking. Alex calls upon the local Cambodian police to help him, though he finds the local inspector less than enthusiastic. The Beckers are not without their own personal baggage, having lost their own young daughter some time ago.

The story puts a human face on child sex trafficking. Even though it is a dramatization, many of the events portrayed in the film are inspired by real life occurrences. Foreign pedophiles come to third world nations with their fat pocketbooks, trolling for young children that they can prey on without fear of persecution unlike what they would face in the West. The local criminal organizations are able to buy off the police and keep the local population in fear of reprisals should anyone dare speak out against them, so they are able to procure young girls, some as young as five for these pedophiles. It is only through concerted efforts by organizations such as the one Alex works for that provides hope for these young, innocent victims.

The movie also serves to educate - trafficking is especially rampant in societies where poverty is prevalent to the point where parents sacrifice their own children to traffickers for money to ensure their survival, no matter the high cost paid by the victims. Traffickers are able to intimidate people to keep silent so that they may continue to reap profits from their young victims, many of whom do not make it in the long run due to the toll it takes on the young victims in terms of their physical, emotional, and mental health. Yet there is an element of hope in the form of local rehabilitation efforts for rescued victims of trafficking which provide the victims a means to recuperate from their ordeal while also training them in skills that will allow them to earn their own living and concerted efforts by NGOs and also local law enforcement to arrest and prosecute foreigners caught soliciting the services of under-aged girls. The film may be low-budget but it has its heart in the right place and brings much needed attention to the issue of human trafficking.",1359072000,2,2437,4.869879518072289

5254623,5,B0093BUW2I,This film is an inditement of the Sex Trade and is not a Documentary. This puts a human face of Sex Slavery and the culture that surports it! Also reveals the Face of the Sex Tourist and how sick their desires are! Fine performances by Dehnont and Mira and the surporting actors. Direction and Screenwriter Bassette shows a deft hand with both the actors and the direction of the film. I would fully encourage you to see this film!,1358553600,,431,4.468354430379747
5254624,5,B0093BUW2I,"I am very interested in this subject, being in the legal field for going on thirty years and at one time a child advocate.  This movie really gave a good look at this growing horrible crime of child trafficing.  It was informative but written in good taste.  There were no sexual scenes, however you got the point. All American's should watch this film to understand the suffering of these children from all over the world.  The men who pay for these chldren for sex need to be proscuted to the fullest extent of the law.",1358294400,9,521,4.4526315789473685
8535121,5,B0093BUW2I,"My heart breaks to know that our world has gotten so bad that young children are used to satisfy the sexual appetites of evil animals.  I am covering my beautiful grand daughters and every other young person I know and don't know with prayer.  I plead the blood of Jesus over their lives.  Parents, grandparents you better know who your children/grandchildren are associating with. You better know where they are and what they are doing. My son, now 28, got upset with me when he was a young teenager because he wanted to spend the night with a friend. I told him that the boys mom had to come meet me.  My son said later that I was relentless with the questions I asked. We are responsible for our children even when they are not with us. Ask questions and be informed.  It's not just girls that are in danger, it's boys too.  I will not leave my grandbabies alone for even one second in my garage.  I will not give anyone even the remotest chance to take them. My daughter in law made an astounding true comment after our twins were born. She said ""No ever prepared me for the fear that parenthood brings with The birth of our children"". She is right but if we are careful and cautious, we can protect the greatest blessings that God gives us.  I pray for these angels daily and so do their parents and grandparents. I pray for all that has been taken and pray for a safe return in Jesus name....",1513209600,,1398,4.329501915708812
