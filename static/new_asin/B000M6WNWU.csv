8166834,5,B000M6WNWU,"I found this on DVD in my local library all the way over here in Australia. I was thrilled to find it, being an enthusiast of the the art and culture of the first nations of the Pacific Northwest.
This story was emotional and eye opening. The amount of red tape for the return of the pole was more than I'd ever imagined in this modern time, still.
 What I enjoyed most were the stories and information given by the carvers of the new poles and other Haisla people. Seeing the replacement pole go up was a very special moment, in ways a new history being formed and I'm so glad it was shared with us in this documentary.
The film itself was well done, informative and not lacking in anything. I was glad to see that little bit of extra footage inside the Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver, to show us more of the beautiful carvings by the First Nations of the region. Sort of sad in its own way to see it behind glass. Representative of what the whole documetary's about without being heavy handed.

Wonderful documentary, thankyou.",1345075200,,1034,4.436842105263158
