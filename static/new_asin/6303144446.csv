573210,5,6303144446,"Kids age 2 up will watch this over and over.  My son is 3 and has been watching the whole line of ""There goes a"" videos over for a year with no signs things will change soon.  What did he ask Santa for?  A new ""There goes a"" video!  We now own 6 and have rented all the others multiple times.  Forget all the PC people who say Dave and Becky sometimes aren't PC enough - it's all obviously in fun and won't even be noticed by your kids much less affect them in any way.",1010361600,,469,3.84375
573211,5,6303144446,"We were given this video as well as There goes A Train.  We do NOT allow  our 2 1/2 yr old boy watch TV, only a limited number of videos.  We LOVE  this series and am ordering many more.  Not only is our child entertained  by the videos, but he is also learning about planes/trains. We do not let  our son watch ANY video unsupervised and we find these videos ""not  bad"" for adults also - I learned things I didn't know about trains  & planes and I'm 40!  We also do not approve of cartoons and find this  a great series.  Our son loves these videos and asks for them by name!",968630400,7,576,4.0
573212,5,6303144446,"Reading the existing reviews, I thought I'd add my 2 cents.  My son (2 1/2 years old) *loves* this video.  His other 'There Goes a...' favorites are: Train, Fire Truck, and Bulldozer. As to the age-appropriateness, I think it  really depends on the dispostion of your child.  And as to the 'buffoon'  issue, yes, Dave's a little goofy at times but he always points out safety  issues to counter that and the entire series is extremely informative in  general.  And I'd much rather watch any of this series, *with* the  slap-stick than something like Barney or mindless cartoons.  We try to  limit tv so our son watches these and Sesame Street and that's about it.",964656000,12,663,4.678260869565217
573213,5,6303144446,"We were given this as a gift. My son loves it so much that I am ordering all the others. What also makes it much better than Barney, Teletubbies,  etc. is that his older siblings can watch it with him and not go brain  dead. Pilot Dave is goofy, but little kids like that. I highly recommend  this video.",964483200,5,304,4.11864406779661
573214,3,6303144446,"For those of you familiar wit the series- Dave really is a little hard to take without Becky as a foil.  Very informative but a little dull at times.  My 2 yr. old prefers ""There Goes a Boat"" or ""There Goes a  Motorcycle.""",952646400,3,222,4.116279069767442

7839230,5,6303144446,My kids are getting ready to go on the airplane for the first time so I purchased this video. The girls watched it and I think it helped them a little more to understand more about airplanes. It is a cute video.  The seller shipped our video right away! We got it within the week. I recommend the seller for sure!,1300579200,,313,4.131147540983607
7839231,5,6303144446,Informative and fun to watch.  My eight year old boy loves it; so do we!,1194134400,,72,3.8
7839232,4,6303144446,"Except for the scary parts, like when Dave has to fly the biplane, or the screaming when he loses control over the jet...! my 3-year old loves it, as well as bulldozer and above all helicopter (5 stars). He hates the train video, can't stand when Dave wears the conductor uniform or spills food all over the passengers. There are a few seconds of scary parts in each video: in garbage truck Dave is seen head stuck down in the garbage; in tow truck he smashes up a car trying to get it attached to the tow. It's neccessary to be around when the video is on. Why he likes the explosions in bulldozer is beyond me! But overall, a positive series. I buy them as cheaply as possible though...",1109462400,,688,4.3
7839233,4,6303144446,"Dave Hood's series ""There Goes a .... "" are informative and entertaining.  Personally I think this is the weakest of the ones we've seen, but our three-year old loves it.  I think too much time is wasted on trivia and it's  painful to watch the airline attendant tell us how she greets passengers and shows us where the stirring sticks are located, but try to tell that to your kid!  Pilot Dave rides in a stunt plane, a passenger jet, an aircraft carrier and a jumbo UPS carrier, among others, and lots of fun is had by all.",1031184000,7,525,4.326530612244898
7839234,5,6303144446,"My son is just 3 years old and he is far away from becoming a professional of the wide blue yonder, or anything else.
Like many kids of his age, he looks up frequently to the sky and points ""look at that plane!"", as if he had a factory-installed radar, and at the table he announces that a spoon is about to land, so the noodles will be met at gate 4.
Like many kids of his age, he drags me along, to and across every airport and airfield he sees, and he loves to watch the planes come up, down and around.
So... I began to look for books, videos and other stuff to please him and, at the same time, if possible, recover for myself the power to decide when to go to the nearest airport.
Then I found there were:
1. Movies with planes. He may laugh out loud with Rocky and Bullwinkle, which is imaginative enough for a kid, but sure I will not let him watch Pearl Harbor for a while. Oh, yes. He once had chosen Pearl Harbor at a video store.
2. He's had enough with Barney and the Little Airplane, Bear in the Big Blue Jumbo and Teletubbies Go Flying. He says he's ready for something more extreme.
3. Discovery videos about planes. They are fun and instructive, but you cannot imagine the reaction of the relatives when a 3 year old starts repeating ""the force which makes helicopters try to rotate in opposite direction to their rotors is called 'torque'"" (toddler pronunciation, please).
4. Videos for pilots. Expensive and much too difficult to translate from 'plane English'.
Then I found this one, fun, instructive, easy, realistic and yet imaginative, containing all real live action he demands, showing from the backstage many real planes just like the ones he sees at the airport.
Now I have decided to buy the entire collection, including fire trucks, garbage trucks, police cars, trains, boats, spaceships and that bunch of big funny noisy machines I don't have in my backyard to show him.
This video is excellent --his words, not mine.",1017878400,21,1947,4.487323943661972
