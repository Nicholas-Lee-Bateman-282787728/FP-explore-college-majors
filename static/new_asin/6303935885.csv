7858263,5,6303935885,"I'll admit it, I loved this show when I watched it in syndication as a kid. Watching it again as an adult, it brings back a lot of memories (like that weird thumbs-up salute), but it's not a show that holds up well to thoughtful examination.

These origin episodes are easily the most rational of the whole series. They give a decent reason why control over the single vital weapon Earth's defenders need is in the hands of a small boy. They even explain why the boy joins Earth's defenders. But why is Johnny always thrust into front-line battles with armed bad guys? Why don't the bad guys put more effort into targeting Johnny or destroying the robot's control? Just how much intelligence does that giant robot have, anyway? It's best not to think too much about such matters.

No, it's best to remember that it's just a show, and to relax and enjoy the action. There's lots of weaponry but no one ever seems to get hurt. There are lots of monsters, but they seem to be there mainly for grown-up laughs. And Giant Robot needs a few seconds of warm-up gestures for almost everything he does, but thank goodness, he's never interrupted. I suggest you collect the whole set and store them for when you need a fix of fun, non-threatening action.

Back of the box:

Episode One: Dracolon, The Great Sea Monster. Young Johnny Sokko embarks on an ocean voyage, but suddenly his ship is under attack by the giant sea monster Dracolon! Johnny and his new friend Jerry wash ashore and are captured by the villainous Gargoyle Gang. They escape a secret lab, Bang! An atomic blast brings a 100-foot tall robot to life, and it's under the boy's control! Meanwhile, the evil Emperor Guillotine has ordered the sea monster to destroy Tokyo. Giant Robot fires up his jets and flies to the scene. With defeaning blasts, the robot victoriously destroys Dracolon with his huge fingertop missiles!

Episode Two: Nuclean, The Magic Globe. Johnny Sokko is initiated as Agent U7 into the heroic Unicorn Agency. When a glowing meteor plummets to earth, Johnny and Jerry (Agent U3) are sent to investigate. The meteor bursts open and a massive metal globe rolls out. ""Nucleon"" is more than just a rolling wrecking ball -- it sprouts arms, it flies, it destroys obstacles with blinding heat rays! ""Help, Giant Robot!"" Johnny is knocked out by Gargoyle's men, but when he awakens, Johnny commands Giant Robot to demolish the massive globe. Once again, the benevolent Unicorns triumph! Too bad, Guillotine!",1125619200,,2481,4.76046511627907
7858264,4,6303935885,For the price it's a great Giant Robot show.  Very similar to Ultraman or the Godzilla films with a bit of extra cheese.  The Egyptian robot shooting rockets from his fingers is just so cool looking.  It's worth getting for fun on VHS but I can't wait to add the DVDs.  Don't pay too much for the VHS...the quality seem poor now that I rewatch them.  The main reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.,1076544000,5,398,4.116883116883117
