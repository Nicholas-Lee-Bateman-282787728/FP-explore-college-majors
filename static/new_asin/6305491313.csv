  A very slow and boring opener.  It was not as good as I expected.  The Godfather wins.**

Ivory v. The Fabulous Moolah  Women's Title

  A very funny match but with a dumb ending.  You have Moolah beating Ivory WWF are you crazy.**1/2

New Age Outlaws v. The Hollys

  This match was absolutly horrible.  The New Age Outlaws get themselves DQ.  Hollys win by DQ.*

Jeff Jarrett v. Chyna  IC Title

  Wow an incredible match.  This is a possible match of the year canidate.  Chyna wins the IC Title in a great match.*****

The Rock v. The Bulldog

  This match was way to short you could have given it more time Vince.  The Rock beats the heck out of Bulldog.**

The Hardy Boyz v. Edge & Christian  Ladder Match

  Classic match.  The only ever Ladder Match with only two teams.  Hardyz win and the crowd goes wild.*****

Val Venis v. Mankind

  This was a very good match.  I loved it.  Val beats Mankind in a hard fought battle.****

Kane v. Bradshaw v. Faarooq v. X-Pac

  This match was not very good but it delivered.  But how in the world does X-Pac beat 3 giants.***

Triple H v. Stone Cold Steve Austin  World Title

  Why?  This match was just bad.  Austin needed neck surgery find somebody else to face HHH.  HHH retains in a bad match.**",1100390400,2,1274,4.350877192982456

  It was a decent little match with the Godfather winning.

Ivory v. The Fabulous Moolah  WWF Women's Championship

  Oh,my god just skip the chapter this match is so bad you should break the part of the DVD off and fed it to your dog.  Oh yeah Moolah wins.

New Age Outlaws v. The Hollys

  Interesting but not to great espically with the ending.  Hollys win DQ.

Jeff Jarrett v. Chyna  Good Housekeeping Match for the Intercontinental Championship

  Great match loved it but Chyna wins come on.  How is a guitar not a household item.

The Rock v. The Bulldog

  Good but way to short.  If you would have given it more time it would be a classic.  Rock wins.

The Hardy Boyz v. Edge & Christian  Ladder Match

  This match was a classic its the reason the PPV has 2 stars.  This only two team ladder match that I saw ever.

Val Venis v. Mankind

  Why do you have a hardcore legend jobbing to VAL VENIS!  Val Venis wins in the worst match ever with Mankind.

Kane v. Bradshaw v. Faarooq v. X-Pac  Four Corners Elimination Match

  I believe this match could have been better if they pushed it.  X-Pac wins.

October 17, 1999

Gund Arena

Cleveland, Ohio

The Godfather V. Mideon

Ok opener. It actually could have been better. Godfather wins. *3/4

WWF Women's Championship:

Ivory (Champion) V. The Fabulous Moolah

You have a 70 year old women in there with a late 20's early 30s. This match sucked. Moolah wins the title and I don't care if it is a memorable moment, it's stupid. 1/4*

New Age Outlaws V. The Hollys

Good match, but it could have been better. The Hollys win by DQ. **1/2

Good Housekeeping Match for the Intercontinental Championship:

Jeff Jarrett (Champion) V. Chyna

This match was entertaining, don't get me wrong, but, you have Chyna win the Intercontinental Championship? This is one of the worst moments in the WWF ever. You have a great wrestler in Jarrett jobbing to Chyna? How is a guitar not a household item? I have a guitar, my father has a guitar, hell, my wife even have a guitar. It's a safe beat that most people have atleast one guitar in their house. Jarrett got screwed. He would leave for WCW the next day and one thing that WCW did that I liked was that they put the World Title on Jarrett. The match was a ***

The Rock V. The Bulldog

This is the British Bulldog getting that push that he should have gotten in his first run in the WWF. Wait, he did, for two months in 1996 and they were awesome matches. The Rock wins and this match could have been a little longer and better. **3/4

Ladder Match:

The Hardy Boyz V. Edge & Christian

This is the first ever Tag Team Ladder Match and it won match of the year in 1999 and it's not hard to see why. This was a great moment in the WWF because it helped the company turn the corner if only for a short time until Benoit joins the company and has some great wrestling matches and don't forget Angle who was waiting in the wings for his time to shine. Awesome match with some sick bumps and I think it's the only ladder match that has had only two teams in it, but I'm not sure. Hardyz wins in a classic. *****

Val Venis V. Mankind

This is Val's big push. This match was actually not that bad. It was actually very good. Val wins and he basically did nothing after this, which is sad, because he is a great wrestler and very underrated. ***1/4

Four Corners Elimination Match:

Kane V. Bradshaw V. Faarooq V. X-Pac

Good match, nothing really noteworthly here. X-Pac wins. ***

WWF Championship:

Triple H (Champion) V. Stone Cold Steve Austin

Great match with, you guessed it, Triple H winning. ***3/4

Overall, a good show. Putting the Intercontinental Title on Chyna just gave that great title a very bad name. Triple H wins because Austin needed neck surgery and the ladder match was just awesome.",1096675200,,2700,4.412955465587045
1050971,4,6305491313,"I have been a fan of the WWE for many years, and when I think back on all the pay-per-views that I have seen, No Mercy 1999 is definately a memorable one. The main reason to buy this show is because of the ""Ladder Match"" between Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz. With the acception of the ladder match at Wrestlemania 10 between Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon, the 1999 No Mercy show had the best ladder match you will ever see. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I did not want it to end. It had fast paced, high flying action mixed together with tons of brutal bumps. The other match on the card worth mentioning is the WWE Title match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H. Both men put on a great performance and were at the top of their games.
You are probably asking yourself why I only gave No Mercy '99 a four star rating. With the acception of the two great matches, the rest of the card stunk. Some of the awful matches consisted of Ivory vs Fabulous Moolah, Godfather vs Mideon, and The Rock vs The Bulldog. Even though 90 percent of the pay-per-view is bad, I still consider No Mercy '99 a must own. The ladder match and the title match are just too good to pass up.
A solid 4 stars...",1078099200,,1224,4.147058823529412
1050972,1,6305491313,"I repeat - Do not let others fool you because this event was one of the worst WWF pay per views ever. Actually, I think this very well might be the worst pay per view in half a decade!
The undercard was dreadful and the main event was not good. This was a sad mistake for a pay per view event!
If you like only sports entertainment and could care less about wrestling, this may very well be the one for you! Hell, The Corporate Ministry are in every segment and practically come out after every match... FUN!",1047513600,,508,4.1938775510204085

Womens Title- Ivory vs. Fabulous Moolah- This match was kinda boring because of the fact that a old woman was fighting for the womens title. 2/10
Four corners elimination match-Farooq vs. X-pac vs. Bradshaw vs. Kane-This match was pretty good. All four men were great in this match. Lots of cool moves and stuff. 7/10
Good House Keeping Match for the IC title-Chyna vs. Jeff Jarrett-Awesome match. They used lots of stuff you'll find around your house. But they should of used a lot more stuff on the table. Half the stuff they hardly looked at. But its a awesome match. 9/10
Terri Invitational Tournament ladder match-Hardys vs. Edge and Christian-Its an o.k. match. Most people say its the greatest ladder match ever but really its kinda like a regular ladder match. But these men were kinda new to the wwe so its good for their first try. 8/10
Godfather vs. Mideon-boring.its like a regular raw match. 2/10
New Age Outlaws vs. The Hollys-Its a very long match. Its also very slow moving.zzzzzzzzzzz. 6/10
Bulldog vs. The Rock-why do they make Rock face Bulldog?They could make him fight a bigger a tougher guy. Overall the match was good. 7/10
Mankind vs. Val Venis-like The Rock why does Mankind face Val?I don't get it. These guys are big and strong. They don't need Val and Bulldog. 6/10

Austin & ""The Game"" fight through the crowd a lot, beat each other up with chairs, and literally just beat the holy heck out of one another! Edge & Christian take on the Hardy Boyz in a ladder match. This ladder match won't blow you away if you've already seen the T.L.C. matches from Summerslam 2000 and Wrestlemania 17. But it's still kind of cool for it's time, I guess. Chyna takes on Jeff Jarrett in a 'good housekeeping' match for the Intercontinental Championship. Chyna makes history in this cool and funny matchup by defeating Jeff Jarrett to become the 1st female Inter. champion! Simply awesome! Chyna is cool! Also, The Rock takes on ""The British Bulldog"" Davy Smith in a pretty cool matchup. There's also a scene in which The Rock is brutally attacked by HHH with a sledgehammer! Not for the faint-hearted, as Triple H pummels The Rock with the large steel hammer several times across the chest and back! This PPV really lived up to its hype.

1051018,3,6305491313,"No Mercy featured some GREAT matches but also featured some POOR matches.
Godfather & Medion started things off in a slow match which would have been good to open RAW not a PPV.
Womens championship on the line as Moolah vs Ivory. What do you expect froma old lady against a young lady? Nothing, this is another match sidelined for RAW.
Hardcore holly's take on The New Age Outlaws in a decent tag bout. Although this would have been a bit more intense if the tag team titles were on the line.
A 1st for the WWF, A Good House Keeping match which featured Chyna taking on Jeff Jarret for the I.C Championship. Better than you would have thought but wasn't anything great. Few interesting weapons such as a toilet seat and probably 1 of the most stupid weapon's in wrestling history: a dead fish...what were they thinking?Anyway this was entertaining but not your 5 star classic.
The Rock vs British Bulldog in a quick match up and was nothing special, the effort put in this match would have been nice for smackdown or Raw.
Another 1st for the WWF is the AWE inspriring Tag Team LADDER MATCH between the Hardy Boyz vs Edge & Christian in an unforgettable 5 star match up. This easily stole the show and went on to become match of 1999 and one of the best matches ever. An Awesome usage of ladders, these guys did it all in this one as the crowd stands up and applauds numerous times during the match. There are alot of high spots  and i won't say one because it will take the suspence ""of whats are they planning to do next"" away from your imagination.
Mankind vs Val venis in a decent bout that could have been better. It seemed like Mankind was going downhill at this point ""as he says in hard knock and cheap points"" until he fueded with HHH as his Cactus Jack persona.
X-pac vs Kane vs Farooq vs Bradshaw in a four corners match. This was a very interestng match as Farroq and Bradshaw are a tag team as well as X-pac and Kane, but X-pac wanted to prove to Kane that he can hang with the big boys. Nothing to special but a decent outing.
WWF World Heavy Weight Championship is on the line:
HHH vs Stone Cold Steve Austin
And that night on heat Vince made it a No DQ match which made it more interesting. Not a bad main event, something you would expect from these two which is GOOD.Starts off with some brawling then they get back into the ring where the refs get kncoked out a few times. This match was a defanate ""as good old J.R. would say"" SLOBBER KNOCKER.
All in All if you are a True WWF fan this will fit nicely to your collection as it does feature an extrodinary match up (Tag Ladder Match) and ONE of the best and most jaw dropping matches ive seen. If you don't want to buy thats fine but you must hire it as you cannot call yourself a fan of the WWF without seeing this surperb match up.",1012694400,,2801,4.265037593984962

It's not the acrobatics that make a great ladder  match, it's telling a story that keeps the fans in suspense and using the  ladder to do some devestating maneuvers...not just LEAP FROGGING it.
My  friend and I sat down to this match, and were expecting big things since we  had seen both of the Shawn Michaels/Razor Ramon ladder matches, and  everyone said that this one was better...well, this one wasn't even CLOSE.  We sat there the whole time going, ""When are the big bumps coming?  When are the high spots coming?"" Then...it was over, and a it was a  terrible ending at that.

1.) The Godfather w/The Hos vs Mideon w/Viscera

The Godfather had run into some trouble with Mideon and Viscera leading up to the PPV. Godfather graciously offered Mideon his Hos but Mideon declined stating he preferred farm animals. Very weird and disturbing right? But hey, that's what made the Attitude Era so great! Godfather was jumped bu Mideon and Viscera on the final Smackdown before this PPV and it lead to this match. This was a decent opener for the show. Lots of outside interference and distractions took place from Viscera throughout the match. Mideon controlled most of the match but Godfather came through with the Ho Train in the end to get the win

- Michael Cole does a backstage interview with Ivory on her upcoming match with Fabulous Moolah

2.) Women's Championship Match: Fabulous Moolah w/Mae Young vs Ivory (c)

This was a bad match and luckily only lasts around 3 minutes. There were lots of slow and botched moves and the only reason worth watching this match is to hear Lawler's hilarious commentary  Moolah wins the title with a roll up

- A replay of Vince McMahon making Triple H's match with Stone Cold a No Holds Barred match on Heat is shown

3.) The New Age Outlaws vs The Hollys

This match came about when The Hardcore and Crash cost The Outlaws their Tag Team Championships on the last Smackdown before the PPV. The Outlaws would be looking to exact their revenge on The Hollys. The Hollys and The Outlaws were both two of my favorite Tag Teams in the Attitude Era and I think they put up a fair showing in this match. Road Dogg got worked over by The Hollys majority of the match before making the tag to Billy. The Hollys get the DQ win after Billy performs the Fame Asser on Crash on a Steel Chair

4.) Good Housekeeping Intercontinental Championship Match: Chyna vs Jeff Jarrett (c) w/ Miss Kitty

With back and forth drama going on between Chyna an Jarrett over the last month, the two would final settle the final score in this Good Housekeeping match. This match had a lot of sexist riding on it. Leading up to the PPV, Jarrett believing a woman's place was in the kitchen, bullied and beat up practically every diva on the roster! Jacqueline, Ivory, Mae Young, Fabulous Moolah, Lillian Garcia, 1999 internet queen Cindy Margolis, and even his manager Miss Kitty! This match was pretty much a Hardcore match but with a different name and was entertaining to say the least. There were a ton of kitchen utensils and foods at ringside such as a frying pan, a blender, bananas, ironing board, whipped cream, salami, creme pies, fish, and more. Chyna ends up winning the match with a guitar shot to the head after the referee restarted the match when Jarrett used the IC Belt to win the match the first time.

5.) The Rock vs The British Bulldog

This match came about after Bulldog screwed over The Rock twice in matches against Triple H. This was a short match that ends with The Rock winning with The People's Elbow. Based on how personal this feud got, this match should've gone on for at least 15 minutes but still a good match, nonetheless. Just too short

6.) TIT Ladder Match: Edge and Christian vs The Hardy Boyz w/Gangrel

In what may have been the best match to happen to WWF in 1999, rising Tag Team stars Edge and Christian and The Hardyz tore each other shreds and pushed each other to the limit in this grueling and exhilarating Ladder Match, battling not only for $100,000 but the services of Terri as well. Although Edge and Christian lost, there were no real losers in this match. All 4 competitors were winners and the fans let them know it when the smoke cleared. This Ladder Match would be the genesis for the Triangle Ladder Match to come the following year, featuring the Dudley Boyz, followed by the TLC Match

- A video replay of Val Venis attacking Mankind in the bathroom after a book confusion with The Rock, earlier on Heat. Following this video, The Rock returned to the ring and cut a promo announcing that he's challenging the winner of the WWF Championship match. As The Rock headed to the back, Triple H jumped out and attacked him with the sledgehammer, causing Rock to be stretchered away

7.) Val Venis vs Mankind

A nearing 10 minute grudge match between Val Venis and Mankind that Venis wins after performing a Testicular Claw on Mankind. Mankind attacks Venis after the match

8.) Four Corners Elimination Match: Farrooq vs Bradshaw vs Kane vs X-Pac

I think this match was more to push X-Pac than anything. X-Pac was out to prove he could hang with the big guys of the WWF and he was tested here by being in the ring with 3 other monstrous giants in Kane, and The Acolytes in this interesting Four Corners match.

9.) No Holds Barred WWF Championship Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Triple H (c)

This is one of my favorite matches to come from the Attitude Era. Not in the Top 10 or 20 but definitely within the Top 50. Being a huge Stone Cold fan, I was behind Austin in this one. Like most No DQ matches in the WWF, the action went everywhere in this match. It started at the entrance ramp and spilled into the crowd. Eventually the match goes in the ring and we get tons of back and forth action from HHH and Steve Austin. The match ends with The Rock returning to the ring for the third time in the night with a sledgehammer, looking to exact some revenge on Triple H for the attack, earlier in the night. The Rock attempted to hit Hunter with the hammer but got Austin instead. Triple H Pedigreed Rock for his trouble, picked up the scraps and covered Austin to retain.

After the bout, Austin attacked Triple H and beat him into the backstage area. Triple H eventually escapes and bails the arena in a limo with Chyna. This would be the last PPV Stone Cold Steve Austin would compete at until the following year's No Mercy

Overall: A pretty good No Mercy PPV altogether. The only match really not worth watching is the Women's Championship match. The rest of the matches are enjoyable in their own way and if you can find this VHS, I recommend adding it to your collection. If not, check it out on the WWE Network!",1393372800,,6334,4.4973867595818815

The match between The Rock & The British Bulldog was a well-fought & explosive encounter. The tag team Ladder match between The New Brood(Matt & Jeff Hardy) & The team of Edge & Christan was a high-flying,hard-hitting,hard-fought match of the night.
