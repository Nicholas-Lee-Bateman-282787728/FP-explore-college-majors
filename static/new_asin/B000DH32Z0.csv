Unfortunately, the green toning ring snapped  within two weeks (about 8 workouts). You can use light hand weights instead of the toning rings supplied with the DVD; don't spend extra to purchase the combo. Buy the DVD and light dumb bells or other resistance bands. I have the same problem with the boogie cords supplied with Richard's ""Toning to the Oldies"" DVD. Like the workout, but the accessories leave something to be desired. I'm on my third set of boogie cords, and there doesn't seem to be any way to replace just the tubes.",1422662400,,638,4.747747747747748
8102355,3,B000DH32Z0,"I have the two VHS combo Tonin' Uptown and Tonin' Downtown. Combined, that series is an hour long work out and *exhausting*. But the results I've achieved have been amazing, and got me in great shape.

Unfortunately, I played the heck out of those VHS tapes (I got them in 1997), and they no longer work! I was going to pull them out to get in shape once again!

So I looked through the DVD's offered here, especially the toning ones (I still have the two rubber stretch bands with padded handles from the other series). I purchased Supertonin' Totally Tonin'...especially because it features 80's music.

My son has been using this for fun (kids!), and I just now joined him for the workout. Surprisingly, I barely broke a sweat with this under-30 minutes DVD! (And believe me, I'm pretty out of shape. The Tonin' Uptown and Downtown would have kicked my butt!)

The moves are super-simple, but the warm up doesn't even get your heart pumping (like the Uptown/Downtown did). This DVD features all the same upper body exercises that are on the Uptown VHS, but not quite as intense.

Surprisingly, there's only a little bit of ab work and the only lower body work was during the warm up and cool down! That's right: no leg lifts at all! So this is mostly a quick, easy upper body stretch workout.

This would be an excellent DVD for those who are obese, waaaaay out of shape, and for children. I suppose it's good to do *some* exercise--and this DVD may tone a *little*--but it's not going to do anything cardio wise or fat burning wise, in my opinion.

There are fun 80's hits like Physical, Funkytown, a fast version of The Greatest Love of All, and The Greatest American Hero. None of these are sung by the original artists, though, which is no biggie.

There are no cheesy extras in this DVD (as there was in the Uptown/Downtown series--a fake ""band"", Supremes-like back-up singers, and lifeguards)--so that's great. It's set up in a fake mall center court, featuring men and women of all sizes and shapes.

Richard is, as usual, very encouraging and upbeat.

It's a good beginner DVD, all in all, but not that great if you want to get your heart pumping or want to burn fat through toning.",1149638400,21,2193,4.571428571428571
8102356,2,B000DH32Z0,I eagerly awaited this DVD because I really enjoyed Tone and Sweat.  This was a big disappointment.,1141776000,3,99,4.823529411764706
8102357,5,B000DH32Z0,"No surprizes here- Richard Simmons is well known for his motivating exercise videos. If you enjoy his style, you'll like the DVD. It is not aerobic, and has little stretching, but is very good for those wanting to tone their muscles. Great for beginners! Richard is a hoot!",1141171200,7,273,4.708333333333333
8102358,4,B000DH32Z0,"I received this dvd and the tonin' rings and I really enjoyed the workout except there is no workout for the legs.  Overall the workout is fun and I must say the energy is there without being over the top like other toning workouts by Richard.

I recommended this video keeping the above in mind.",1139097600,,296,4.363636363636363
8102359,5,B000DH32Z0,"I ordered this when it was first released and it took less than ""4 to 6 weeks"" to get, so hopefully you will have the same luck!  This is my first Richard Simmons toning workout and was skeptical at first because it was so short as compared to some of his aerobic workouts.  But I was pleasantly surprised!

This is a great workout for a beginner and exercisers who haven't strength trained before.  The toning rings are easy to use (and a must have) and Richard is very encouraging.  He does give some instruction, but I suggest you watch it a few times and look in a mirror to check your form, which is very important.  There is also a section at the end after the credits that talks about form.

This is a great workout no matter what shape you are in and he shows you how you can do the workouts from a chair.  And you can't beat the music!

1. Everlasting Love (warm up and stretch)

2. The Greatest Love Of All (use one of the toning rings)

3. Funkytown (use the second toning ring)

4. Physical (abs and floorwork)

5. The Greatest American Hero-Theme (cool down)

Its 25 mintues long, not including the instructional section at the very end.  This is great for Richard fans and those new to strength training!",1138752000,17,1218,4.351111111111111
