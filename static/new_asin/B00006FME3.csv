7967968,1,B00006FME3,"This had potential to be cool, but I think they missed it.  I think it was a huge mistake to do almost all of the dunks in slow motion, or that weird jerky rewind view.  There are many dunks that they never show just in real time, as it happened.  I watched this because I wanted to watch real streetball, not some overproduced, trying-to-make-it-seem-cool camera/effects tricks.  It's cool enough on it's own, without that, but we don't get to see it.  The effects didn't make it more exciting for me, they just gave me a headache and made me wish I was watching real clips on YouTube.  Disappointing.",1334275200,,602,4.527777777777778
