8435279,5,B004LXBKD8,"For me, this is the only version worth watching - others may disagree, but I think this has everything, and is as near to perfect as I could imagine. It is respectful, devout, and also loving and warm. Enoch zu Guttenberg marshals his forces in miraculous form - choirs 1 and 2, plus a third as a sort of 'greek chorus' to sing just the repeated, intermittent chorales. a childrens choir for the ripieno, 2 orchestras, a continuo group, plus extra organ and viol da gamba, all in addition to the vocal soloists. If it sounds grandiose, it isn't - all the groups are small and in keeping, and there is an intimacy that is truly endearing. Yet the professional and artistic standards of every participant, are sky high - to a quite formidable degree. It soon becomes clear that each and every performer, however lowly, is nevertheless a soloist in their own right.

Of course, this outfit, orchestra and choir,under Enoch zu Guttenberg, had an international reputation at the time this was recorded, in 1991, and here is eloquence, spirituality, as well as something sumptuous and 'baroque' - despite the bare walls and lack of ornamnent - which has an integrity and dignity, and yet speaks directly to the heart. Qualities which would be hard to find now, and because of it's timeless values and standards, there is nothing dated about the whole effect.

All performed in a fairly small church, this is an amazing undertaking, a real joy, in which everything comes directly from the heart, and to the heart, with nothing in between to get in the way. From the audience members, right through to the conductor, for whom this is clearly a labour of the utmost love. Hermann Prey, as you would expect, glows with the brilliance of a ruby in a candle flame, at the centre of everything as the Christus. The childrens choir, standing exposed and elavated, are incredible, knowing precisely what to do and when, and doing it perfectly, singing from memory, and although they only sing twice in the whole 3 hours, for the remainder of the time, they sit quietly, without fidgeting, following the music. Not many children these days could even be blackmailed into doing that!

I was brought up on the Klemperer recording with Fischer-Dieskau, Christa Ludwig et al, and for me, that it still the best and most beautiful, but this dvd is the visual equivalent. I am sure there are other very good performances, but if like me, the visuals matter, and you do not have a taste for 'contemporary' interpretations, with the choirs sitting and standing in odd positions, or being 'assisted' by 'narration', and other such gimmicks, then this version is the one to go for. In my view, this wonderful, affecting work couldn't be done better, nor I think, nearer to Bach's intentions.",1364515200,11,2765,4.768267223382046
