7881639,5,6305054967,This was definitely a wonderfully exciting movie and Jennifer Beals did it again.  She spruced up this movie 100%.  Jennifer Beals is very gifted and that is nothing but God placing her in the acting roles.,1384992000,,206,4.694444444444445
7881640,3,6305054967,"I rate this movie ""Spree"" starring Jennifer Beals and Powers Boothe 3/5. A veteran cop(Boothe), turns rogue after falling for a beautiful and much younger professional burglar (Beals).  There's a small twist towards the end. The sex scenes have some redeeming power. The acting is mediocre. Rita Moreno plays the mother of Xinia, the burglar and you have to wonder why this Rita's talent was wasted on the role. There's a disconnect in the movie between Xinia and her family. I wondered why they couldn't have lived remotely somewhere, I don't think they brought anything to the story. Lastly, I couldn't place Jennifer's accent, so I'm not sure if it was a bad accent or just unrecognizable to me. It wasn't a hard movie to watch.",1264809600,2,731,4.801587301587301
7881641,5,6305054967,I LIKED THIS MOVIE.  JENNIFER BEALS WAS GREAT AS A THIEF AND THE PACE OF THE MOVIE KEPT YOU INVOLVED AND MOVING ALONG.  IN THE END YOU WERE SURPRISED HE DIDN'T TURN HER IN.  JM,1212192000,4,176,3.9714285714285715
7881642,4,6305054967,"It seemed more reality based than typical crime dramas.  Really explores the point that there isn't much difference between cops and robbers.  It is thrilling and maybe that's the attraction for humans no matter which side of the fence they are on.  It is Not Rated but I'd say it is at least a strong R rating.  Powers Boothe was great, I didn't figure out the ending as with most stories.  I wasn't familiar with Jennifer Beals but she is good in this movie also, especially doing sex scenes, she looks confident and beautiful!",996624000,11,529,4.585106382978723
