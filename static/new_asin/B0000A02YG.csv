1900428,5,B0000A02YG,"The holy grail of Britcoms comes to DVD at last.  Okay, maybe it's just my holy grail but needless to say I'm glad that ""Bottom"", a series for the most part unseen outside of the UK, is finally seeing the light of day on these shores.  I first saw this show from my roommate in NYC who was a big Britcom fan (Hi Heidi).  My gawd it was hilarious.  Stupid but in a good way.  If you want a sophisticated show, look elsewhere.  This is the modern British equilvalent of The 3 Stooges or The Marx Brothers but only more vulgar and demeaning.  Rick Mayall and Adrian Edmondson (from The Young Ones) just nail their roles.  It is really sad that they don't get their dues.  Seek this out.  It will make you laugh out of sheer embarrassment.",1065830400,3,735,4.260869565217392
1900429,5,B0000A02YG,"I have to admit that I have been a huge Rik Mayall & Ade Edmundson fan for many years, and having lived in London I have been able to see these shows and the many repeats they did.
Bottom is very much slapstick comedy, with rude language and great timing. All three series are very funny and even the lesser episodes are still full with funny moments and great one-liners.
This box set comes with Bottom Fluff - all the outtakes and mistakes, plus a few extended scenes.
The quality of the transfer is crisp and clean, sound is good and if you like in-you-face comedy, this is the ultimate show.
And you know what? Their live shows (all on R2 discs) are even funnier, ruder and more violent.

Finally, Warner Bros. has seen the light and is releasing the funniest TV series EVER, ""Bottom""! You don't need to be well versed in Britcoms to appreciate this - just a fan of all-out laughter.

I have tried everywhere to get Bottom on DVD and had bought a multi-region player so that next time I was in the UK I could bring some back. It is great news to see this anarchic comedy being put out in a generous 3 disc set. If you like your humour outragious and littered with a fair amount of painful slapstick, then this is definitely for you.
Buy with total confidence if you like the mad humour of Cleese, etc. .....and of course it does have it's fair amount of toilet humour...hence the title!.......Also, look out for the release of a 4 disc set of the king of UK sitcoms....Only fools and horses, one of the funniest UK sitcoms ever. you may take a while to understand the lingo....but you will love it all the same.....or you must be a ""24 carrot plonker!""",1061164800,11,886,4.2485207100591715

1900445,5,B0000A02YG,"You see it's not really a comedy at all. It's a tragic drama series. People often mistake the antics of Richie Richards and Eddie Hitler as crude and childish but the series should be seen for the quality of it's intrinsic character.  Bottom is nothing less than a pathological commentary on the dire social situation existing in modern society. Eddie is apparently totally unaware of the significance of his sir name and the reaction it receives when confronted by well meaning cosmopolitans. Ric on the other hand is a total and complete bastard. There, I had you going there for a minute. This series is the best thing out of Britain since Bass Ale.",1385596800,2,652,4.719298245614035
1900446,4,B0000A02YG,"Of all of the pairings of this duo (Adrian Edmonson and Rik Mayall), this one arguably has the most humanity, even if they are both somewhat terrible people. The wit is (somewhat) more sophisticated that The Young Ones and much better than Filty, Rich and Catflap. It is an interesting dynamic to see the two as a quarreling ""married"" couple, for sure. However, the manic energy remains, as does a lot of violent slapstick (ala Young Ones). Has rough edges and not ever episiode is particularly hilarious, but overall it works. And, with so relatively few britcoms available on DVD, you have to get what you can!",1374710400,,612,4.728971962616822

Either its a typo or the 30 MINUTES refers to each episode. Is there any chance of finding out how long the TOTAL RUN TIME is???????????????????????????",1274400000,,329,4.5
1900452,5,B0000A02YG,"Surprisingly, I didn't like `The Young Ones'. I just didn't get into it as much as everyone else seemed to. So you can understand why I was a little skittish about `Bottom'. It had been recommended to me by Netflix & it wasn't until I'd seen a preview for the show that I decided to give it a whirl. I'm glad I gave it the chance.

Bottom follows the antics of Richie & Eddie, both of them complete losers. They spend their days mostly staying inside their dilapidated home, with Eddie remaining blitzed & Richie trying to scheme up ways to get rich & get birds. No matter how hard Richie scheme, nothing ever comes to fruition. (Mostly because despite his attempts to improve himself, he's just too lazy to put any real effort into it!)

This show really is one of the best of its era. The humor is low brow & that may cause many to automatically dismiss it, but they'd be losing out on a real gem here. Mayall & Edmondson are really at their best when they're playing bottom of the barrel characters.

I'll admit, this isn't a DVD set that you should watch one episode after another. At least not at first- if you are new to the show (as I was), the humor is best appreciated if you watch only one or two episodes in a sitting. (Plus it makes the set last longer, which is definitely a bonus.) Since the entire series is in this set, there's no need to rush out & purchase any other DVDs- you have it all here.

Anyone who loves low brow humor of any nationality should really love this set. I mean come on... who couldn't laugh at the sight of a man taped to the ceiling?",1257552000,4,1574,4.236666666666666
1900453,4,B0000A02YG,"I recently purchased the DVD Full Bottom: Not Another Half-Arsed DVD Set and I have to agree with the subtitle. Totally Full-Arsed. This writing and acting duo is best known in the US from the 1980s series the Young Ones. Full Bottom originally aired between 1991 and 1995 in the UK, when Adrian Edmonson and long-time partner-in-crime Rik Mayall delivered 3 seasons of mayhem for the BBC. Opening with a stripper music theme that sets up their pathetic non-existent love lives. They illustrate a perfectly dysfunctional union, the Odd Couple meets the Three Stooges. It shouldn't work but it does. Over the top physical stunts and an earnest commitment to character pull the audience in. It is easy to overlook how good the work on this series is while we are soaking in the clueless optimism wrapped up in an array of impossible Sad Sack scenarios. All in all, a fun wild ride.",1252368000,4,879,4.751633986928105
1900454,5,B0000A02YG,"This is slapstick at its best, with more 'slap' than 'stick'.
Completely over the top, radical, often very physical comedy with a very twisted slant.
A little less weird than The Young Ones (not a bad thing) but just as frenetic.  In my opinion it retains the best elements of the former, while adding a hefty dose of new envelope-pushing crazy antics.

Fantastic viewing, just beware the R-rated language if young ones (no pun intended) are around.

In short, Eddie and Richie are desperately pathetic housemates, and all they have is each other.  But that doesn't stop them from trying to upstage, lie, cheat or steal from each other until the cows come home.

Cue brilliant craziness and the kind of mental comedy that is impossible to find these days with broadcasters neutering their material for fear of offending anyone...",1247011200,2,829,4.892857142857143

1900456,3,B0000A02YG,"If you liked the English alternative comedy 'The Young One's' or 'The New Statesmen,' you'll probably enjoy this series, just not as much.  Rik Mayall, who in real life is no doubt a wonderful person, has made a career playing REALLY annoying characters (Drop Dead Fred); in this series he takes that role to new lows.
In short, don't watch this series with someone who does not appreciate the more sophisticated crass-and-vulgar style of humor.",1232841600,,445,4.933333333333334
1900457,5,B0000A02YG,"Anyone can be gross, adolescent, and violent, but it takes real talent and intellegence to actually pull it off and make it genuinely funny.  With Bottom, Young One's alumnus Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson have accomplished just that.  They introduce us to the lives of Richie Richard, and Edward Elisabeth Hitler, two utter pathetic people, who do little more then clutter up the gene pool and waste oxygen that would be much better used elsewhere.  The two live out their meaningless existances thinking about little more then breasts, television and drinking, pausing every so often to beat the tar out of one another.
Given that description it seems an unlikely likable duo, but they pull it off as well as any comedy pair in history.  It's filthey, foul, utterly chaotic and as funny as anything that has ever crossed the pond.  If you like British comedy and the Three Stooges or are a Young One's fan, you will definitely love this.",1224979200,3,940,4.813664596273292
1900458,4,B0000A02YG,"Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson do another great show together, although their roles and the premise doesn't stray far from The Young Ones.  In fact, it's almost like a sequel...but not quite.  Rick plays Rich Richard, and Adrian plays Eddie Hitler, two geeks that are very similar to their characters in The Young Ones.  Eddie seems to be the only one with a job or a major drinking problem.  Rich is a useless waste of space who just wants to ""have it off with some bird"" which in American translates to ""have sex with a girl"".  But with his character being so identical to Rick in The Young Ones, no girl will go near him, even when he douses himself with pharamones that he bought in an adult toy shop.  Their constant struggle to co-exist and exist in the real world lands them in constant chaos, and at odds with everyone they encounter.  Another TYO friend, Chris Ryan occasionally joins them in the role of Dave Hedgehog, who is another socally inept loser.  Cowritten by Rik and Ade, the humor is often similar to TYO, but since they stick with the designated plot, this show's appeal is more widespread and easy to grasp.  Good British humor.  Loads of laughs.  Often very silly.  They still like to beat each other up, throw each other down stairs or drop refrigerators on each other...and basically just commit random acts of violence.  And just about every episode ends up with either Rik or Ade getting punched, hit, kicked, electrocuted or shot....often by each other, but sometimes someone else gets the pleasure.  If you like Rik and Ade in The Young Ones, you'll like them in this next-step-natural-extension called Bottom.  Go try to ""have it off with a bird"", and whether you succeed or not, you will feel better with the few laughs that Bottom delivers.",1212105600,2,1774,4.659163987138264

They always fail to improve their status in life, but they keep trying. Bottom is written by, and starring Rik Myall and Ade Edmonson. Britcom fans remember them from the Young Ones, another great show. The show is loaded with slapstick sometimes so violent, it would make the Three Stooges cringe. Plenty of kicks to a certain area, punches, foreign object in eyes etc. Plenty of bathroom humor also. However it is one of the funniest shows ever from England. In many ways its like Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges put togeher. I highly recomed this set.",1204329600,,762,4.644444444444445

Bottom refers to social strata, more important in England than elsewhere, and these two are there in every way. It is always easy to feel better after watching this series knowing that at least you are not them.

One of the more priceless bits is the caviar scene in Digger: ""Caviar is fish poo, sir. It is poo that comes out of a very expensive fish's bottom."" Who can write these gems anymore?",1198800000,2,571,4.327102803738318

It is extremely anti-PC, sexist, sleazy, violent, yet, most importantly, it's hilarious.  The British have that unique talent where they can do or say the most heinous things, and make it all sound so charming.  Too many critics didn't like this, naturally comparing it to The Young Ones, and not seeing it as a series on its own.  The violent (and I mean violent) slapstick is hilariously over the top, Rik and Adrian are great, and there is some depth to this series.  It's not a deep experience or anything, but sometimes you feel a little sad for these two, especially Richie.  Favorites are the Gas episode, and when Richie and Eddie ""become"" shopkeepers.

In my own opinion, the shows start to get a little weak after the first series, as it seems like good storylines are replaced with quite repetitive physical comedy (Richie and Eddie beating the living daylights out of each other).  I also thought that the endings were a little on the lame side as well for most shows, but I guess this is just the style of Bottom really.

All in all though, I still think this is one of the best British comedies around.  The Christmas special (""Holly"") and the ""gas man"" and ""burglary"" episodes are classics!",1140048000,3,735,4.630769230769231

I doubt any American or Canadian television station really wanted to be associated with this show. It is the violent story of two loosers (a chronically masturbating virgin and his roommate Edward Hitler) who have hit rock bottom sharing a flat in England. As I said it is violent (if you want to call repeatedly being kicked in the groin, hit over the head with a frying pan, being tossed about by the nose with a pair of pliers, or beating the gasman into unconsciousness with a cricket bat violent) but it is also grossly tasteless. Serving someone fresh urine as sherry, puking in someone's soup (you can actually see it coming up) munching a brick of lard with a swig of cooking oil, sitting in a bowl of ""petrol"" to loosen the grip if petrified underwear... This show is thoroughly disgusting and it may be a good idea to be wearing an industrial strength diaper when first seeing it as you might mess yourself. The extras (outtakes) are hilarious. The dialogue sometimes, particularly in fast moving/insane scenes, might be a little tough for a N.American to follow but the physical comedy, childish facial expressions and slapstick is so funny that this is a minor consideration.

When Richie and Eddie go camping on Wimbledon Common and run out of food (within 5 minutes of getting there) Richie's morbid mind turns to cannabilism:

Rich: ""What's that film were they all eat each other?""
Eddie: ""Deep Throat.""

The humour can be surprisingly subtle in places and the writing is superb, especially when Richie and Eddie are stuck in the flat
with nothing to do. Not much happens but Richie's inevitable wish to annoy the hell out of Eddie is a joy to watch.

Even though the humour can be crude for some, there is an innocence in their otherwise rotten lifes (Richie's virgin teenage-like pangs: ""Why won't anyone have it off with me?"")

The innocence, and cartoonish violence, reminds me of Laurel and Hardy (both get on each other's nerves, and both seem to physical damage each other, buy design or accident, but, on the other hand, both cannot seem to survive without each other).

Series three is the weakest of the three series. It relies more on shouting and slapstick than great writing (which is balanced perfectly in the first two series). Though, the episode where Rich and Eddies are stuck on top of a ferris wheel is an exception. Even so, series three is still brilliant.

My favourite episodes are: Richie's birthday party where he breaks both his legs and the Christmas special where Richie cuts his finger off and Eddie staples it back on - Merry Christmas!",1133222400,12,1887,4.696969696969697
1900478,5,B0000A02YG,"Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondsons best work ! if you liked Rik and Adrains fights in the young ones you will love the chaos in Bottom. Gross, violent and funny. and if you want more of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondsons insane slapstick go and buy the Dangerous Brothers video.",1127174400,2,274,4.5
1900479,5,B0000A02YG,"Isn't it about time this boxed set came out!  Amazingly it is being released in the US (that should say something in itself).

Remember The Young Ones, next came Filthy Rich and Catflap (which you probably won't remember), and then came Bottom.  Each step (in my opinion) has been an improvement on the previous.  If you haven't seen FRC then definitely give it a go (classic scenes such as the axe, the bottle on the head, trivial pursuits should not be missed - it could save your life!).  But back to Bottom, the boxed set includes their dangerous brothers segments - ""incredibly dangerous I am sure you will agree"".  The outtakes - e.g., the fish finger and the donkey are also classic moments.

I point out that The Young Ones ran 2 series and Bottom ran 3 series.  Bottom also gave rise to some of the best Live performances from the pair (also available on DVD).  I would suggest then that you buy Bottom and find out for yourself why so many are screaming praises for Rik and Adrian.

The ultimate evolution of Richie and Eddie is a must see for anyone who likes physical comedy taken to it's ultimate finest.  This physicality is refreshingly washed with an immense subtlety of depth that Rik and Adrian bring to their performances.  There is a tremendous history between the two by the time they reach Bottom that their acting appears spontaneous despite the brilliant scripting.  Rik adds pathos and Adrian adds the uncomplicated brutality of someone who can't stand too much pathos.  It is brilliant stuff carefully honed across the series.

Want to find out how they developed the subtlety?  Already seen The Young Ones and Filthy Rich and Catflap?  Looking for more? The Comic Strip Presents (a box set is available for this too) is the next step for you!  There is an absolutely brilliant feature with Peter Cook called Mr Jolly Lives Next Door.  This is worth the set alone and is classic Rik and Adrian. Both have books out Adrian's is particularly good.

What about after Bottom? Rik also elaborates on the pathos in a far more developed way in ""Believe Nothing"" but it would have worked so much better had Adrian's character still been included.  Rik Mayall also ran some features via Rik Mayall's playhouse - good acting (not comedy) but good stories and great depth.

Rik and Adrian also had a film venture ""Guest House Paradiso"" which has much of the pathos/brutality (a brilliant intro sequence with Adrian) but is detracted by the format in my eyes.  To me it seems to draw too much from the Faulty Towers (disfunctional hotel) genre.  I was fortunate to see it in the cinema's and some old ladies were sitting in front of my friend and I and they left in the first 10 minutes.  It was just brilliant.  I do like Faulty Towers though.

For other good UK comedy (not Rik and Adrian) try Father Ted, Red Dwarf, Black Books, Gimme Gimme Gimme, Spaced, etc.  In no particular order -

On this alone, I picked up the Full Bottom set, and was not disappointed. Matter of fact, I'd have to say I prefer this to The Young Ones...no stupid pop bands or bad extraneous filler material creeping into the works here! This is brutish, stupid, violent, schoolboy behavior as executed by two grown men. There's something marvelously childish about it all. There's a certain degree of phoniness to all the blows to the groin. This is probably one of the few instances where sexist behavior is actually genuinely funny. Yes, it's base, but the characterizations of these foul, disgusting human beings as executed by Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmonson are nothing short of hilarious. Fact is, the Richie and Eddie characters don't know any better than to not have jobs, get drunk, try to scheme cash (or, as in one episode, natural gas), and fail miserably with women, and that's exactly what's so smart about it all. When all you other kiddies get over Will Ferrel and the like, get on to the genuine living cartoon that is Bottom and bask in the brilliance that is Rik and Ade!",1108080000,14,1234,4.639269406392694

Bottom is the hilarious setting of two losers always trying to find sex  or ending up beating the crap out of each other when they disagree with each other. They are confused with sexuality and nothing EVER goes in their favor.

If your going to buy a Britcom, this a MUST!!!  Rik Mayall's facial expressions alone will knock you down to the floor in stomach hurling laughter. I have never seen anything like this show. It's Rude! It's discusting, It's perverted and full of Double Entandres. In my book, that means it's a class act trip to wetting your knickers.

And DAMN IT! I pray to the BBC Comedy Gods, that they release another series set of Bottom in the U.S.  I would buy every show ever made. It is totally worth the money!

The fact that two Young Ones actors are also in Bottom prompted me to give this series a try.  I'm glad I did.  You can think of Bottom as The Young Ones minus a lot of the gross gags, although Bottom is not totally barren of these.  Another ironic twist is that Rik Mayall plays a right wing patriot rather than a left wing anarchist as in Young Ones.  Fans of The Young Ones will notice a blatant similarity between the final episodes of each series.
Now, where is Filthy Rich and Catflap, another series featuring Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson?  Come on, BBC Video.  Please release this one as well.",1089158400,,727,4.373134328358209

No point going over this episode by side-splitting episode. What I really enjoyed about this set were the ""gimmes"" the extras. It was nostalgic for me to watch ""Boom-Boom"" (Rik Mayall's pre-Young Ones show). But for my money, the bloopers/outtakes, which are usually lame from other series, are riotous here.

1900489,5,B0000A02YG,"Listen, I'm not an elitest snob but I won't ignore what I know myself.  Tv has gotten pretty lame lately and is showing little sign of getting better.  Sitcoms that are touted by everybody as being funny and aren't, dramas that hype the drama and don't deliver.  Good shows like Farscape and The Job which get canned while demons on NBC and CBS go untamed.  Thats what I like about BOTTOM.  It says that you'll laugh and you will, it doesn't shout it out loud either.  There are no major plots just silly events which turn into stories on their own.  It has a cult following and we can pray for new episodes or at least the live performances to come to disc as well.
BOTTOM comes from the minds primarily behind THE YOUNG ONES (another bastion of great watching) but on a slightly more mature and grown up level.  If THE YOUNG ONES was a ""family"" show with Vyvian as son, Neil as mother, Mike as dad, Rick as daughter, then BOTTOM is a husband and wife style show with two chums (and no they aren't gay but at times Richie seems boderline), Sexually frustrated and annoying Richie (the wife) and stagering jobless drunkard Eddie (husband) share an apartment in England.  They don't have much money, they don't have many friends, they almost never get the girl and both are almost ingratiatingly stupid.  All they have is each other, and thats why one would cheat the other out of anything even to merely creep ahead in life, even if it means giving up a greater fortune.  Don't worry YOUNG ONES fans, all of the slapstick violence and verbal abuse came over intact without the weird surrealism and side storys.
The entire series is here on a three disc set.  SMELLS has the boys getting ahold of Pheramone spray and then testing it out on girls at the local bar, too bad they don't know that they're already ""taken"".  GAS, one of the funnier epsiodes has the gas man coming to read the meter in the apt.  Little does he know that they are stealing gas from their neighbor.  Can they get stop the meter man, without killiing him anyway?  CONTEST is my favorite episode and cements the ""husband/wife"" relationship of the show with Eddie blowing whats left of the money on a vintage porn magazine and then expecting to watch a beauty pagent on TV all the while Richie slaved away making a terrible meal complete with green bacon.  APOCALYPSE has Eddie and Richard hitting the fair and finding out from a gypsy that Richie has 3 days to live, sure enough he gets to meet the reaper.  In BOTTOM'S UP, Richie and Eddie's landlord pays them to watch over his store while he goes to funeral, they decide to sit on the roof and watch sports instead.  ACCIDENT has Richie breaking his leg on his birthday and condsiders killing himself when his nonexistant friends don't show up.  The scene where picks his teeth after drinking is priceless (and gross).
DIGGER has the duo hitting a dating sevice.  After Richie lies about being rich a countess shows up hoping to merry only for his money.  PARADE isn't so much funny as it is the best story in the series.  After scoring some cash, the two go to the bar where the local bookie, whos hammered spills the beans about a hot tip.  to raise cash for the bet, they steal a war veteran's fake leg and sell it at the pawn shop.  CULTURE shows us what the boys get up to when the TV's been repossessed, with nothing else to do, they play chess.  Too bad Richie is too hyper and excited to remember he doesn't know how to play chess. BURGLARY has the guys catching a burglar in their house and find his stolen loot.  Only one thing stand in the way of them going to Barbados, what to do with the burglar.  Well....they could kill him.  The Christmas episode HOLY has gifts passed around, fingers cut off and possbily the second coming with Richie in the role of Mary.  After all he is a virgin.  BOTTOM'S OUT has the two staking out some land for a camping expidition not 50 feet from the bus stop.  Along with GAS, one of the funniest episodes.
HOLE has Eddie and Richie debating life and stuff after they are trapped on a ferris wheel.  Oh well they can get off in the morning, hopefully before the wheel is demolished...  TERROR has Richie and Eddie trying to get money at Halloween with a cattle prod.  When the party starts, Richie attempts to contact Satan.  (By the way this episode aired years before South Park did, you'll know what I mean when you see it)  BREAK concerns Eddie and Richies attempts to get in shape so they can score some girls on an upcoming vacation, they have to survive working out and each other first.  DOUGH is definetly the most plot oriented episode with Eddie counterfitting money and end up trying to win a quiz match so that the local counterfitter doensn't crush their skulls.  FINGER has the pair stealing honeymoon tickets from a local cricket champ and end up posing as a couple with Eddie making a truly ugly woman.  Hattrick for this episode, Eddie gets booted in the crotch 3 times.  CARNIVAL is the finale with Richie stealing a TV camera during a riot and attempting a ""funniest home video accident"".  The tape in the camera shows something quite different and then the two attempt blackmail of the prime minister.
One of my new favorite shows and one that should live on longer then others.  If you were a fan of THE YOUNG ONES, it definitly deserves a watch.",1079568000,52,5338,4.471074380165289
