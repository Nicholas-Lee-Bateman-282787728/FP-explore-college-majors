Although it finished the series and was as good a the others I did find it a bit anticlimactic. As if a sequel had been planned, yet was never done.",1369353600,,264,4.0
8002773,5,B0000TPB3M,"One of the first things that crossed my mind as I began to dive into these last eight episodes was that someone had turned the plot upside down.  First there is Ranga, then the rest of the Kyoshin.  Then the Curiotes, and Tao, and so on through the metaphysical universe.  Even gods, it seems, have gods.  Of course, everyone, including the armies of two nations wants to beat up on Ranga.
Each episode seems to crack open another layer of intrigue and betrayal, until the view isn't completely sure who is on what side.  A good general rule is that whoever is attacking Ranga is not one of the good guys.  But even that isn't entirely clear.  While all of this is great fun to watch, the Shimabaras, always caught in the middle, gradually become the worse for wear.  Thus, the royal family of Barou and their immediate friends are torn apart by the issues that surface in the conflict.  For some this menas healing, for others, grief.
But where do all these gods come from?  Buried in caves and underwater, the Kyoshin rise and struggle, only to fall again.  Men reach for godhood, and a strange wormhole appears in the sky.  Is this science fiction, a political statement, or something deeper?  Not all the questions will be answered, and the viewer will find much to consider in reaching for closure.
This second season of Ranga started out on an uneven keel, with weak animation and art.  It finishes with some of the best work in the entire 48 episodes.  In the end, with the strength of the director's intent in full display, one has to acknowledge that Neo Ranga has unexpected strength and depth.  Reminiscent of other anime that manage to combine the serious and the comic into a happy mix it is a series worth sampling.",1080086400,,1729,4.564935064935065
8002774,5,B0000TPB3M,"A year has passed since the Shimabara sisters visited the island kingdom of Barou. During their stay, they encountered various revelations; all of which seemed too surreal to be true. But nothing prepared them for the chaotic life they will lead after coming face to face with Neo Ranga -- a god, their servant, and a key to mysterious disppearance of their brother Masaru. Ever since, Minami, Yuuhi and Ushio have fought day at a time in their search for paradise.
Now, the sisters are faced against their fiercest enemy yet, the god Ibuki. By using Ibuki, Fujiwara believes that he and the Kyoshinkai can lead Japan to a new age of global prosperity. Fujiwara pouts that his action is a act of fate, as well as carrying out what Masaru has wished in their days of friendship. Ibuki quickly wins the heart of millions by tearing apart Ranga, but Niyeru seem to have a ambition of her own aside from Fujiwara and the Kyoshinkai.
As even her closest friends are starting to betray her, Ushio is hit with a sudden realization that the world that they live in is hardly a paradise. The society that they live in is made of strict laws and orders, and Ushio couldn't stand the thought of people being controlled by power other than their free will. Her fear turns out to be that of a cosmic scale, as Ushio and the rest of the world soon finds out that the entire universe is governed by a even greater force. Ushio is repeatedly told by others that there is no such thing as paradise in this world. That the real world is where people's dreams are constantly shattered. Nonetheless, Ushio chose to believe. Believe by placing all her faith in Ranga. By doing so, she tought -- they might all be able to reach that Utopia one day.
In this final chapter of the ""Neo Ranga"" saga, many mysteries that shrouded the series will finally come into light, including: the truth behind disappearance of Masaru, the origin of the Suuras, as well as the history behind Ranga and the ultimate god Tao. Be prepared for the unexpected, as the final four episodes of ""Neo Ranga"" will bewilder you to the very end.
All being said and done, ""Neo Ranga"" was a fine series. It's probably not a series people will remember as a flagship of '90s anime, but those who have seen the show will always have a place for it in their hearts. The show constantly aimed to take a unconventional path in plot development, with mixed results. Certain aspects of ""Neo Ranga"" could've used definite improvement, namely the consistency of animation. But the show brought up many issues that we cope with daily, such as the concept of morality, definition of free will, and human relationship with god and religion.
Despite few shortcomings, I can't help but give ""Neo Ranga"" as a whole 5 stars.",1074211200,5,2754,4.588235294117647
8002775,5,B0000TPB3M,"Okay, I've loved Neo Ranga since the beginning.  Even though sometimes it seemed to lag, it was still good.  And the end was even better.  Though a little short due to the length of episodes, they manage to make it end well, leaving many questions and a possibility for a sequel which I sincerely hope.  So get it!  it's great!",1073520000,4,327,4.383333333333334
