4160484,5,B003NNG5YQ,I could not find this movie for sale anywhere so of course I checked Amazon.com.  I saw this movie when I was a young boy and didn't even remember the name of it.  I found it only because I remembered the nickname given to the kid that ate the pancakes.  HUNGRY SMEAD always stayed in my memory and I'm glad it did.  That allowed me to find the name of the movie and order it for my kids to watch.  It has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time and it is now also one of my family's favorites as well.  Sure wish somebody was still making movies like this one.  The quality of the product was top notch and shipping was reasonable and quick. Hard to believe I could have found it anywhere else without AMAZON.,1319500800,3,718,4.049645390070922
4160485,5,B003NNG5YQ,"This film is a superior, charming, gay-90s (1890s that is) ""coming-of-age"" study focusing on a spoiled brat adolescent boy from a rich family who discovers, in some cases forcibly, that the world does not revolve around him and how to get along with others as a distruaght mama and papa decide to send their raucous youngest son, who has exhausted every other option except reform school, to a private institution with a reputation for turning ""...pretty nearly any young heathen..."" into a decent Christian gentleman.  You get to see the stubborn young protagonist (played by the 1950-ish era's primo male child star Dean Stockwell) learn why his new schoolmates have names like ""Tough"" McCardy, ""Cheyenne"" (after only a 1/2 century of intimacy), ""The Tennessee Shad"", ""The Coffee-Colored Angel"", the ""White Mountain Canary"" or ""The Great Big Man/Hungry Smeet"".  You get to see him squirm with the use of his new nickname, ""Dink"", given to him (derisively at first) by those new schoolmates.  And, guiding all of these young men through the process of becoming ""...butterflies..."" from ""...the dirty, soiled cocoon..."" of boyhood is the crusty Latin vocab teacher ""The Old Roman"", who ends up being Dink's football coach in a season where the final game is a desperate bid for respect against an arch rival (this is before the forward pass was allowed, mind you).  There's even a humorous peek at the dull American-Victorian era Sunday afternoon and how to handle the opposite sex in the quaint practice of the old-fashioned ""call"" on a young lady!  (Do you like Maude Adams?!)

There is some of what is now called ""mild violence"", but it is handled strictly Marquis-of-Queensbury and anyone under the age of 40 will probably get frustrated at the pace of this film, and wonder where the blood, gore, flashy effects, etc., that seem to find the way into any kind of movie nowadays, are (there are no firearms or use of swearing in about 90 minutes of show, can you believe it?!).  Setting aside modern film fault-finding, if you did like flicks such as ""Breaking Away"" in the 70s or ""Fandango"" in the 80s or ""Stand By Me"" in the 90s, or enjoy the ""coming-of-age"" (sub?)genre, or just enjoy well-crafted movies, you should like, or at least be interested to see, how this kind of theme was treated by William Wellman in 1950.",1313452800,9,2325,4.870886075949367
4160486,4,B003NNG5YQ,Certainly not Academy Award caliber.  But I enjoyed it.  Good characters.  Great setting.  Boys growing into men and characters like the Ol Roman leading the way.  Very worth while purchase.,1307664000,3,190,5.2
4160487,5,B003NNG5YQ,this is a wonderful film about the growing up of a young boy set in america at the early part of the 20th century.they don't make many films like this one nowdays.a first class movie suitable for the whole family to enjoy.,1305676800,5,222,4.309523809523809
4160488,5,B003NNG5YQ,I found the quality of this dvd to be excellent. Dean Stockwell was terrific in this movie portaying a boy who after getting into mischieve on several ocasssions (much to the embarassament of his high society parents) is sent off to a private school where he will hopefully be reformed into a responsible and studious student and character. Some of the antics which go on at this private school are hillarious. Young Dean Stockwell was terrific in his role. I have watched this movie twice now and enjoyed watching it the second time as much as the first. It's one of those movies that I don't think one could ever tire of.,1303603200,7,623,4.571428571428571
4160489,5,B003NNG5YQ,"This is a great little movie. The movie was filmed mostly on location at the Lawrenceville school and based on the the stories by Owen Johnson. Johnson's stories are based on stories that were passed down (and I'm sure they were embellished somewhat) at the school. Several of Johnson's stories were woven together to form the screenplay and did not happen at the same time (so there were many liberties taken). It was pretty amazing that this movie was made in color. Color was usually reserved at this time to musicals, especially at MGM. To film ""The Happy Years"" (originally they intended to call it ""The Varmint"", I believe) the paths and roads on campus were dug up and afterward replaced. This was Robert Wagner's first film, although he only had a bit part. The film was thought to be lost in an MGM fire, but as a favor to the school, MGM managed to find a copy of the film in very good condition; I am told the copy was found in a salt mine in the mid-West where MGM kept films safe. A copy of the film was made for the Lawrenceville School. As a student at Lawrenceville, I saw the film twice in the early eighties including the first performance to an audience since it was thought destroyed. Thankfully, the film was not destroyed; it certainly is a gem. I especially love Leo G. Carroll's performance as the Old Roman which is often overlooked; his performance is worth the price if the DVD alone. There is a disclaimer about the condition of the film on the DVD jacket. Don't worry about it. The DVD's pictures quality is really quite good.",1301184000,11,1555,4.498233215547703
4160490,5,B003NNG5YQ,I absolutely love this movie and have been looking for it for years.  Thank you for providing it.,1278288000,2,97,4.388888888888889
4160491,5,B003NNG5YQ,"A reminder of ""the good old days"" when movies weren't so violent and so explicit with sex.  I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1950 as a kid.  It's as good as I remembered.  Good, wholesome entertainment that is certainly suitable for family viewing.  Instead of tagging Darryl Hickman as the one main character listed, I think it should be Dean Stockwell.  He's clearly the star of the movie.",1276732800,6,405,4.647887323943662

4160503,3,B003NNG5YQ,"saw this back in '65 when i was an impressionable kid ... thought it was a pretty swell tale ;-)

i'm in my 60's now and bought it to see how it compares to what i remembered from seeing it the first time around:  a bit dated but still charming. if you're in my age demographic, you'll see some well known actors from our lifetime ... some of them in their childhood / teen years. i may watch it once a year just because i can :-)",1425859200,,430,3.9310344827586206

4160509,4,B003NNG5YQ,"I saw this back in the sixties when I was about ten and loved it. Rented it in the '80's and my pre-teen nephews liked it too.
Would go well with ""Good Bye Mr Chips"" & ""Tom Browns School Days""  to document life in private boarding schools",1367452800,2,238,4.0638297872340425
4160510,5,B003NNG5YQ,"It is somewhat reminiscent of Boys Town on a family scale. The boy starts out being an almost hoodlum type but more practical joker doing things like painting the neighbors expensive show horse green ""to keep the flies off"" to a real leader of his class and mentor for the younger group now. 3 cheers.",1364860800,,301,4.490909090909091
4160511,5,B003NNG5YQ,Interesting to watch a young Dean Stockwell.  Has the charm of the late 19th century upper middle class costume comedic drama.,1362355200,,126,5.0

8401267,5,B003NNG5YQ,Just saw movie for first time. What a surprise. Fun movie with lots of nostalgia. Was football really that way?  Stockwell is exceptional as a bratty kid who reforms himself into a young man.  Lots of laughts.,1520208000,,209,4.621621621621622

8401269,5,B003NNG5YQ,"I first saw this film back in the early 70s on 16mm film. I owned a 16mm projector and rented it from a film rental store close by. I remember how much I enjoyed it and haven't seen the film since. I love Amazon having such an extensive inventory of DVDs, so many I thought would never see the light of day again. I found the DVD and bought it. It was just as entertaining now as when I first saw it. It captured a time and place long ago, a lovely slice of Americana. Dean Stockwell had such an incredible career, that rarity, a child star who also had a successful transition into adult roles. They sure don't make films like this anymore. I wish they did.",1502323200,,658,4.1484375

8401271,5,B003NNG5YQ,"This movie absolutely wonderful, a great movie about a time many years ago. Dean Stockwell, Leo G. Carroll, and Darryl Hickman are first rate in their roles and make this movie so much fun to watch. Dean Stockwell plays Dink Stover who can't seem to stay out of trouble anywhere, whether it be at home or in school and ends up being sent to the Lawrenceville School by his father in hopes of straightening him up. He tends to think that he's all that and a cup of coffee, and will be the top dog where ever he goes. As he finds out quickly that isn't the case at Lawrenceville and the fun begins. I don't want to spoil anything about this movie saying to much, but it's basically about a young teen who is a total brat who learns to grow up and become a respectful and mature young man, and all the stuff that happens along this journey is delightful. This movie has a solid moral story and is very funny to go right along with it. This is definitely a 5 star movie and plenty of fun.",1491955200,,984,4.184210526315789
8401272,5,B003NNG5YQ,"Excellent quality, very enjoyable, partly because I saw this movie in early childhood and have some nostalgia for it, but probably good for anyone who enjoyed ""The Dead Poets Society"" and ""The Emperor's Club"".",1484697600,,209,5.176470588235294

Great Coming of Age Movie. Great Casting & Script. Shot On Site at Lawrenceville.  Especially interesting for Those Who've Ever Lived in a Boy's Dorm.
I'm Surprised So Few Reviewers Mention the Book as their first contact with these school stories...
Movie may seem a bit dated to younger viewers.  But Its a Great Visualization of The Book and Its Nostalgia for Lawrenceville Stories Fans.",1454112000,,910,5.3125
8401275,5,B003NNG5YQ,"The Happy Years, Warner Brothers Studio, 1950, directed by William Wellman, and starring Dean Stockwell, Darryl Hickman, and Leo G. Carroll.  The movie is based on a collection of stories about a young boy named John Humperdink Dink Stover (Dean Stockwell) and the young boys with whom he comes into contact at The Lawrenceville Preparatory School in 1896 in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.

Dink is an incorrigible lad who is uninterested in staying out of trouble. As a result of threats to throw him into jail for such mischief as painting a horse green, supposedly to keep the flies away from him, his family decides to send him to Lawrenceville.  The action that follows is hilarious, and worthy of a director as well regarded as William Wellman.

I first saw The Happy Years as a freshman in high school in 1950, and I still fondly remember the good feeling that arose in me from that viewing.  Over the years, I forgot the movie title, most of the actors names, and the plot, but I decided that I would find the movie.  The only thing I remembered was that one of the characters was nicknamed The White Mountain Canary, and that Leo G. Carroll played a teacher.  I recently purchased the movie through Amazon, and I find that it is as enjoyable today as it was 66 years ago.",1453507200,5,1276,4.594713656387666
