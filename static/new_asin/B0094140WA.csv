8535502,5,B0094140WA,These are hard to find movies here in the states. So I got this set and play them on a dedicated region 2 player. The DVD transfer is superb!,1465689600,,141,3.896551724137931
8535503,3,B0094140WA,"First, I must state that this is a quality product.  All five movies included are Hammer Classics and look just fine.  However, the information in the listing is not only misleading, it's just flat wrong.  I purchased this item to get the Hammer version of 1 Million Years BC.  To my extreme disappointment, that movie is not included in this set.  Neither is Plague of the Zombies.

Amazon should either rewrite the editorial review or withdraw this product from distribution.  I am not at all happy with this turn of events.",1366848000,2,526,4.714285714285714
