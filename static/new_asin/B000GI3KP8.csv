2613093,5,B000GI3KP8,"If you are going to teach yourself, then this is the way to go. My first lessons 35 years ago were from a Stefan Grossman LP and a tab book. It was much more difficult without a visual, but I did learn. I came away with s solid foundation playing an alternating bass. Video opened up a new world and Stefan made the most of it. Seeing is  more then a thousand words could ever describe. I can tell you first hand, that over many years Stefan has also progressed as a teacher. While learning tunes in the easiest possible way you are also being ""pushed"" to learn the right things for the right reasons. This is not apparent at first, but you are learning from a ""skilled instructor"" who well understands what the next curve in the road is going to be and preps you for it. Believe me, as one who made many mistakes and learned the hard way, working with these videos is such a joy. Actually, I find Stefans video instruction much better then face to face instruction with a so-so instructor. Picking up the guitar again after many years of having put it aside, using these videos the things that once stifled me became so clear. If you are not around good guitar players to ""get the feel"", you need these videos. It just doesn't really come any other way. These aren't beginning beginner lessons but if you've fumbled with the guitar some and can hold and change a few chords you have enough to get started. Be prepared to work and you will have plenty to do and enjoy!",1280275200,8,1468,4.338181818181818
2613094,5,B000GI3KP8,This is a wonderful course on fingerstyle blues. Stefan is an obvious authority in this. He makes things look really easy. Not a total beginner course obviously. Definitely worth a lot more than the hundreds of dollars you need to spend on lessons!,1267574400,,248,4.790697674418604
2613095,3,B000GI3KP8,I felt that the instructor rushed through the CD.  If he would have went slower and more methodical I would have understood it sooner and better.,1234742400,3,145,4.576923076923077
2613096,4,B000GI3KP8,"This is an excellent instruction video with an instructor who is obviously skilled.  But if you are not at least an ""intermediate"" skill level player you will quickly become frustrated with the lessons.",1221264000,9,202,5.121212121212121
2613097,5,B000GI3KP8,"Never judge a book by its cover, right?  I profess guilt in this as the cover of this series was not terribly impressive.  What is impressive is Stefan Grossman's ability to teach.

Cleverly staying in one key at a time, Stefan patiently brings the student not simply a solid background of acoustic blues, but also of small ""tricks"" as he calls them.  These ""tricks"" or short licks, hammers, pull offs, etc, are things taken for granted by Intermediate or Advanced players, but the type of little things that beginners listen to and marvel over.  Stefan generously shares these little, and sometimes quite simple little manuevers that vastly improves the sound of the song.

Stefan also includes original recordings of the songs; some from as early as 1927, and has you listen to the original; sometimes more than one version, before hearing him play, and before breaking the song down for you.

The only negative is that the TAB (which includes all the lyrics) has graphics that are not the easist to read.  But, I could not take away from the 5 stars for that.

I never knew of Stefan's music, which may be a plus in my case.  I am able to view him simply as a teacher.  There are a lot of instructional DVDs out there by talented players who are not talented teachers.  Stefan's easygoing personality is a must.  Why?  In taking DVD lessons (which is my only source of instruction) you spend many hours ""with"" the instructor, as you repeat the lessons over and over.  If the instructor's personality is not your 'cup of tea', you will find that you will learn less, as you subconciously pull away from the time spent.  Conversely, when you enjoy the personality of the teacher, you are inclined to spend more time ""with him"" via DVD; subsequently, learning far more.

Such is the case with Grossman.  Perhaps it is the age and wisdom that comes as the ego no longer seeks rock star adoration from people.  I have had the unpleasant experience of sitting ""before"" an instructor who's talent is amazing, but who's love of himself is so over the top, that I ended up selling the DVDs...perhaps my own weakness, but in conversing with others, I find that others feel the same way.

Enjoy Grossman.  He is not there to tell jokes, nor boast of his past accomplishments (Martin Guitar has built one in his honor, so not much else needs to be said).  Enjoy the personality who seems eager to do one thing:  share his love of acoustic blues.

Great series.",1212451200,18,2451,4.62037037037037

8132371,3,B000GI3KP8,Im not sure if my 3-star rating is fair. This is an acoustic blues course in a more traditional blues style. Emphasized are multi-finger picking and strumming techniques. It simply wasn't what I expected. I think it is excellent in what it teaches. Part of the problem is the blues means different things to different people and the story-telling song selection in this series really didn't hit the mark for me. That is not to say that someone else might not benefit greatly by it.,1418083200,4,481,4.670588235294118

After a 25 year hiatus, I am back to my guitar exploring new (to me) genres.  Extremely well done lessons, very well presented.",1368576000,,264,4.458333333333333
8132376,4,B000GI3KP8,"First thing: go to the TAB version in the back and print them out.  Then use that along with Stefans lessons.  This is easy going mostly open chord blues with twists - all at a moderate pace.  It is not blues scales all over the guitar neck.  But I did enjoy learning something different and found it worth the money.

I am a rather advanced player and I picked up some now ideas and techniques by learning the songs he teaches and applying the ideas to my own style.  You don't have to be very advanced but you need to at least know your basic open chords.  He explains it well and then reviews it to help you 'get it.'",1359590400,4,620,4.116666666666666
