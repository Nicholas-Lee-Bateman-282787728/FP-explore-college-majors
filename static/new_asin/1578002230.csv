196393,5,1578002230,"utena is a great series, and even if it is kinda confusing,that just makes it better.  at a young age utena mets a prince.she's so impressed that when see grows up she what's to be just like him........ it has alot of sword  fighting of differnt styles and its fun to watch over and over again. oh  yeah, the songs are great( my favorite's the one in episode10.)",955065600,,362,4.294117647058823
196394,5,1578002230,"This is one of those series which must be watched more than once. As more is revealed about the characters and the mysterious world in which they live, the earlier parts of the series become more impressive. The detail  work in this series is second to none. Only the first four tapes are  currently available in the USA, but as one who has seen the whole series  (39 episodes) I can say with confidence that this is one of the greatest,  if not the greatest, anime series ever made. The first volume seems to be  conventional shoujo anime, but that is just a surface impression. Every  gesture, every line of dialogue, is carefully placed to prepare for the  later parts of the series. It is true that the first volume, which contains  the first four episodes (it is with the second that the series truly starts  to shine) is the least amazing of the series, but it is still most  definitely worth watching. I can't recommend the series highly enough.",951782400,3,952,4.547058823529412
196395,5,1578002230,"I just saw this video and I must say I was very impressed. The animation, story, and music was wonderful. I especially enjoyed the opening theme. I can't wait to see how this interesting story develops. If I were you, I  would try my hardest to get a copy.",949708800,2,256,4.224489795918367
196396,5,1578002230,"I used to limit anime to Sailor Moon and Dragonball Z. But after seeing an add in a magazine for Utena, I set out on a quest to find it. I bought the first volume, Crest of the Rose, and now I'm hooked. I highly recommend  Revolutionary Girl Utena.",943315200,,248,4.061224489795919
196397,5,1578002230,"I must say I was very impressed with the first volume of Revolutionary Girl Utena.  Utena is a truly inspiring character; smart, confident, capable, and strong enough to issue an old-school beat down where it's  needed.",930528000,,219,5.055555555555555
196398,5,1578002230,"""From the director of Sailor Moon!""  That is what the box says, but this is far beyond the elementary school standard of Sailor Moon.  When I first watched the first episode of this video, I thought this was little  too girlish for my taste.  But, when I watched through the entire first  volume, I was hooked.  I couldn't help but wanting to find out what happens  next.  It has very original story line, characters that have their own  distinguished personality (how often does that happen?), brilliant color,  beautiful music, and fabulous direction by former director of Sailor Moon.  Speaking of direction, the scenes in this anime is full of symbolism and  meanings.  An example of this is in the opening scene, where Utena is  walking among the boys, while Anthy is waliking among the girls to show the  boyish nature of Utena and feminine nature of Anthy.  There are occasional  fencing duals, and while some of them may be too short, they are well  animated and beautiful to watch.  This title will attract people with Utena  and Anthy's somewhat lesbianish (is that a word?) relationship, then have  them hooked with its gorgeous scenery, unique storytelling, and interesting  characters.  Check this one out now!",921456000,8,1223,4.916256157635468
7799081,5,1578002230,"If you're about to see Utena for the first time be warned that symbolism lies heavy in here... Anyway, we join Utena Tenjou at Ohtori Academy on the search for him, hoping to be more like him by participating in boyish activities such as Boy's Basketball (and beating the whole team solo). Eventually her friends', Wakaba, heart is broken after a love letter is posted and the love doesn't care at all. Utena challenges him to a duel and that's where the excitement begins. In the second episode we are introduced to Anthy Himemiya (formally) and the rules and power of the student council with the help of a duel. In the third episode we are introduced to Nanami Kiryuu, a coniving little wench set out to be the only object of affection in her brother's (Touga's) life. And in the fourth, is a one-part of a two-part episode showcasing the intro to Miki Kaoru, the student council secretary and (usually) reluctant duelist. The artwork is rather well for inexperiance with the charcters and the four episodes show case beautifully with out letting a lot of the plot leak out. It's a must see for detectives in plots.",1041120000,,1118,4.651515151515151
7799082,5,1578002230,"""Once upon a time, years and years ago, there was a little princess, and she was very sad, for her mother and father had died. Before the princess appeared a traveling prince, riding upon a white horse. He had a regal bearing and a kind smile. The prince wrapped the princess in a rose-scented embrace and gently wiped the tears from her eyes. ""Little one,"" he said, ""who bears up alone in such deep sorrow. Never lose that strength or nobility, even when you grow up. I give you this to remember this day. We will meet again. This ring will lead you to me, one day."" Perhaps the ring the prince gave her was an engagement ring. This was all well and good, but so impressed was she by him that the princess vowed to become a prince herself one day. But was that such a good idea?""
Utena Tenjou was a handsome girl indeed. Why handsome? Every girl thought she was the greatest; every guy wanted to be like her. She could even beat the basketball team by herself. But, she thought everyday about the prince, and would look up to see the rose ring that he had given her that fateful day. Later, Utena and her friend Wakaba see the student counsel vice-president. He is with a girl, later identified as Anshi (otherwise referred to as Anthy is the dub). They see her slapped by Saionji, the student counsel vice-president, but the student counsul president, Touga, stops him.  We also meet Juri and Miki, the other student counsel members. They are trying to win Anshi, who they call 'The Rose Bride'. Utena gets into a duel with the vice-president. But who will win? And if she does win, how will she cope with the Rose Bride? This is all found out in the first tape.
Warning: Utena is NOT for those who like a simple story. This anime goes way beyong simple. Emphasis on WAY. But get the tape--it's very much worth the while. The art gets better as the series goes by (I've noticed the art in the first episode is rather bad compared to the art in the fourth), and it's an anime that makes your mind work, which is always good.",1016582400,,2025,4.371352785145889
7799083,5,1578002230,This was a great video. I loved every minute of it. My best freind gave me this video and the soundtrack (vol. 1). I love it all. The tape and the music. The theme Rinbu Revolution is spectacular. This video is definetly worth it! Especially if your an Anime fan. All the characters are fun and unique. There is great intrigue throughout the whole video.,1001289600,,354,4.461538461538462

7799085,4,1578002230,"Hiya! ^_^ This is an anime of action, romance, fantasy, and comedy too!  It's not for everyone though and that's why I rated it only 4 stars.  I'm not completely hooked yet, I think I need to see more of the series (but I need money **groan**) Anyways, rent it, buy it, see it, it's not one to miss if you're an anime and manga fan ;)  By the way, it's created by the Sailormoon director and alot of the same actors are in Utena.  hehe",995241600,,435,4.023255813953488
7799086,5,1578002230,"It was very difficult for me to decide how to rate this video and what to write about it.  On the one hand, it is probably not for everyone, not even for all anime fans.  However, ultimately I must tell you about how much I liked it myself.
I'm not even sure I can do that.  To describe how much I like Revolutionary Girl Utena is probably impossible.  It is, quite simply, the finest fictional work I have ever come across.  No book I've ever read, no movie I've ever seen, no video game I've ever played has affected me as deeply as this.  My hobby for fifteen years was collecting comic books.  Recently I have moved more towards Japanese animation.  Most recently of all, Revolutionary Girl Utena has become almost a hobby by itself.  It is absolutely addictive, and once you get into the series you will go nuts trying to see all of it.  The source of this madness is the simple fact that you will root for the two main characters, Utena and Anthy, more than anything you can imagine.  You cannot help but want them to happy at the end of the series (which by the way has 39 total episodes), and you will be driven to see whether they are.
As for this first tape, it brilliantly sets up all that is to follow.  There are four episodes, which introduce almost all of the major characters.  There is drama and romance aplenty, and one of the funniest episodes in the series.  I cannot recommend enough that you at least try out this first tape.  After that, you will be hooked, and there is no going back.",976492800,2,1508,4.316725978647687
7799087,5,1578002230,I loved this movie. Especially in the dubbed version. The story thrills me. I definitely recommend this for fairytale and fantasy lovers. My advice is get it while it is in print.,963187200,,179,4.625
7799088,5,1578002230,"Though by the same director as the famous ""Sailor Moon"", Utena is very much different, though the idea of a young female student fighting battles is still present. The show is very fast paced, with complex  storylines, and original twists that include fantasy, romance, battles,  deception, and ordinary school life. Many other shows that center around  fighting battles spend too much time focusing on the punching and the  glory, while the fighting in Utena centers more around old fashioned  dueling, with much more put into the story behind the duels rather than the  actual fighting itself. Though it might seem to be a child's fantasy story  at first, as you get more into the first tape, it becomes obvious that it  is just as much about realistic situations and people, as it is about  mythical powers. If you like stories that involve many different kinds of  situations, that include both fantasy and reality, and don't mind  situations and relationships that some might consider to be unconventional,  then you will almost definitely enjoy Utena. Here's a brief summary of what  it includes. A girl, Utena, has the memory of being comforted about her  parents' death by a prince on a white horse. She wears a ring signet that  he gave her, which is her only proof that she ever met him. A new term is  beginning at the Ohtori Academy, the school which she attends, and where  ever aspect of student life is dominated by the shady student council, who  secretly fight duels between eachother. Through unrelated circumstances  Utena becomes involved in their dueling, which leads to an accidental  engagement and many new unwanted complications in her life.",963100800,2,1666,4.945848375451264
7799089,5,1578002230,"This little anime here truly emphasizes the very fact that Japan is quite obsessed with wistful visions of a fantasy-perfect high-school lifestyle completely saturated with glittery magic, action-adventure, and flawless  youth. Quite similar to the famous master of manga, Osmau Tezuka's  ""Knight of Ribbons"" where a young princess dresses up in a male  garb to embark on a soul-searching odyssey, Utena with her cotton  candy-pink hair and sparkling blue eyes dons a boy's school uniform and  dates the other girls at a very swanky academy school where young children  of the mythical land attend. Then Utena meets a very mysterious black girl  with startling green eyes and lavendar curls at a rose-choked greenhouse  where she tends to the colorful flowers. And Utena sees her get slapped  around. So she challenges the tormenter to a duel, which would take place  in the great ivory arena up in the heavens right underneath a floating  inverted castle. And wins. Thus the ""Rose Bride"" quite gratefully  throws herself at Utena's feet - much to her unwillingness to claim her. A  very misty-eyed fantasy tale filled with princely (princessly?) heroism,  chivalric romance, theatrical drama, lots of swashbuckling action, ideal  visions of innocent childhood and adolescent rebellion, and lesbian  suggestions. Quite sweet and fairy-like!",958176000,,1340,5.3701923076923075
