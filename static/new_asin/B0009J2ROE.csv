8061744,3,B0009J2ROE,"In this 50's TV comedy series, the private secretary to talent agent Peter Sands (Don Porter), Susan Camille MacNamara (Ann Sothern) goes out of her way to help her boss in the most convoluted schemes. Some how she always puts her foot in it; yet in the end everything turns out fine.

Either a victim of old age or bad memory (possible the world has changed); I found this series to be straining for laughs.

The DVD volume one contains:
""Cat in a Hot Tin File""
""Dollars and Sense""
""Old Dogs, New Tricks""
""That's no Lady, That's an Agent""

If you enjoyed the acting of Don Porter then you should not miss him in the Bob Hope classic ""Bachelor in Paradise"" (1961)

The version I watched was distributed by alpha video and was not remastered (it really should have been). The images do not hold up well on today's big screen TV's",1507939200,3,828,4.427631578947368

8061748,4,B0009J2ROE,"Alpha releases 4 more classic episodes from Ann Sothern's delightful sitcom PRIVATE SECRETARY.  PRIVATE SECRETARY featured Ann Sothern as Susie Camille MacNamara, the secretary to New York talent mogul Peter Sands (Don Porter).  However, Susie often gets confused as to the limitations of her job and gets frequently entangled in the lives of Peter and his clients.  Snappy dialogue and great comic support is provided by Ann Tyrrell as Susie's workmate Vi Praskins.  When the series later went into syndication, the title of the show was inexplicably changed to SUSIE.

With the following episodes (presented under the SUSIE title):

""Cat in a Hot Tin File"" - Vi and Susie attempt to keep a stray cat in the office, despite Peter's important new client being allergic.

""Dollars and Sense"" - Susie begs Vi and Peter to help her in curbing her spendthrift habits.

""Old Dogs, New Tricks"" - Susie talks sense to a big-headed child star.

""That's No Lady, That's an Agent"" - Peter becomes infatuated with a rival talent agency boss (guest star Hillary Brooke).  It's up to Susie to set Peter straight!

Hopefully Alpha may release more eps from this delightful show.  A must for fans of vintage TV.",1120953600,30,1196,4.925
