I persinally gurantee it!

If I'm rich, I would say I will pay you back if you don't like it... but unfortunately, if more than 10 persons told me to give them money-back, I would have to declare bankruptcy. So I cannot do :-p

The story is about three ex-convicts who kidnapped a very rich old lady, Toshiko Yanagawa, hoping to get 30 million yen (about 0.5 million US dollar) ransom from her family. Ther were able to kidnap her. But the problem happened. The old lady, Toshiko, insisted three young kidnappers to request 10 billion yen ransom! Toshiko became the leader of three gangsters and started helong them to get her own 10 billion yen ransom.

How come a old Japanese lady can become a main role of a movie? Oh man... this movie changed my life.

It was made in 1991. I was at the elementary school student.

After you watch this video, I wanted to own a company, and I wanted to make a movie.

I came to the US, study filmmaking, and own two companies, and I wanted to do a bookkepping of my company operation for the first a couple years because of this film!

This is very entertaining and absolutely recommended to anyone who loves ransom movie.

The plot and the tricks is amazing.

Sadly, Tanie Kitabayashi who played the role of ""Toshiko Yanagawa"" had passed away on April 27, 2010. But I got to know that the movie is already available to the US market.

So I will push this film 120%.

If you love Japanese film, you must watch it. I gurantee 100%",1273190400,2,1529,4.386524822695035
