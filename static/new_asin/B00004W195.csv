1359908,3,B00004W195,"Let's face it, this movie was a low-budget horror film with bad special effects. But, it does have one saving grace; Peter Cushing is wonderful as a police detective trying to follow the trail of a blood-feasting (totally ludicrous and campy) giant moth woman.
The picture quality of the DVD is fairly good, and the sound is fine. It is presented in letterbox, which is much more pleasing to view then the Pan-and-Scan vhs copy that I first saw this picture on. The setting is Victorian, and having a British cast, the performances are believable and elegant (even if swallowing the idea of a giant Deaths-Head moth makes you gag a little). If your after a film of the quality of ""Horror of Dracula"", or ""Curse of Frankenstein"", then don't bother. But if your a die-hard Peter Cushing fan, like I am, you'll probably enjoy this movie, as I do. There's not much suspense, but there is plenty of dry British humor, and some fine performances. Just don't expect to be dazzled by the special effects. Think of it as Sherlock Holms meets Gozilla, and you'll do fine.",1043539200,22,1061,4.648936170212766
1359909,3,B00004W195,"In the late 1960's, Hammer films was still doing fairly well and there were a number of other companies that tried to copy and compete with them. Amicus was the main one and they had a number of films that were just as good if not better, another company was Tigon films and they are the creators of this particular film.  They pulled in Peter Cushing to play a policeman who is investigating a series of bizarre and brutal killings. Cushing has his suspects and follows them, but his daughter is pulled into the plot as she becomes a source of blood for a moth creature that is being created as a mate for the existing moth creature.  Is this a good film? No does it have it's moments? Certainly The story is in someways lacking, but Hammer's Gorgon and the Reptile don't either and they manage to be entertaining. There is some action, Peter Cushing gives a solid showing and I really thought the sets and use of locations was really well above average foe a British horror film.  The film seems to have gaps and a number of missed opportunites. They would fins a lead, but then people would stand around and mutter about until you start to get bored, then they will peak your interest again and then mill around some more. It is not boring, they just have a lot of time where they could have inserted some more action or clues or maybe some more about how or why this women can turn into a giant moth.  Ultimately, this film is somewhere in the middle of British horror films of the day. It does a number of things right, but Tigon was number three for a reason. I must also say that I had never seen a video done by Image entertainment before, but thet did a good job as the film is of fairly sharp quality.",980985600,12,1711,4.304347826086956
1359910,2,B00004W195,"At least that was one of the more lurid titles this picture was shown under, here in The States.  Peter Cushing is a Victorian police detective investigating a bizarre series of bloody murders; Robert Flemyng is an  entymologist who has somehow created a gigantic vampire moth who can  masquerade as a beautiful woman.  If you get past the laughable concept of  a humanoid moth, the movie's not bad, and benefits greatly from Cushing's  presence.",964137600,16,446,4.95945945945946
1359921,4,B00004W195,"This Redemption Blu-ray looks and mostly sounds terrific. Right around the part where the specimen collector comes to town, back from Africa, there's a noticeable mechanical hum, but otherwise the sound is good. I suppose this monster was inspired by the scary mothman stories coming out of Point Pleasant in the years immediately preceding the release of The Blood Beast Terror. Dr. Mallinger (Robert Flemying) says he created the creature. How he did this is never fully explained. Peter Cushing is excellent as Detective Inspector Quenelle. He actually figures out what's doing the killing...somehow. The morgue attendant is quite unusual and fun, which makes this film even more odd. Interesting...I wish I'd seen it in 1968. It would have been like no other films of that time. There were no other monsters like this on screen, that I can think of right now, until 2002.

1359925,4,B00004W195,"THE BLOOD BEAST TERROR is an entertaining Gothic chiller in the Hammer fashion, albeit lacking the production values Hammer films are often fondly remembered for. Peter Cushing carries off the role of the film's hero--a detective on the case of a series of unorthodox and bloody murders that start off in London and move out in the countryside--with his usual charisma and professionalism, and he's ably supported by a number of solid co-stars, including Robert Flemyng (well-cast as a scientist with a dangerous secret)as well as the lovely and talented Wanda Ventham and Vanessa Howard. The script drifts into the doldrums now and then,and the comic relief isn't always well-conceived, but a rich atmosphere and a measure of unpredictability carry the film through. The eponymous ""Blood Beast"" is scary enough if you can make the necessary suspension of disbelief often called for in science fiction and horror films. The climax is fitting, if perhaps a bit perfunctory. A better overall production than its given credit for, and certainly superior to many horror films to have been released since.",1438041600,,1100,5.185393258426966

1359965,3,B00004W195,"...but it really isn't. That honor must go to LAND OF THE MINOTAUR/THE DEVIL'S MEN or the obscure Canadian anthology film THE UNCANNY. What Cushing probably meant was that this was the worst script he'd ever seen and it's bad but not THAT bad. Cushing and co-star Robert Flemyng (THE HORRIBLE DR HICHCOCK) liven up the proceedings by either injecting very dry humor into some of their line readings or keeping a complete poker face during others. This lends an aura of credibility to THE BLOOD BEAST TERROR (an OK title but it beats the alternate one which is THE VAMPIRE BEAST CRAVES BLOOD) that will either delight Anglophiles like me or have other horror fans reaching for the 2X button on their remotes. If you're a fan of Hammer Horror, then this ersatz version from Tony Tenser's Tigon Productions will have a lot more cache'. The director, Vernon Sewell, would later give us the bad but enjoyable CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR and the just plain bad BURKE & HARE after which he retired.

BLOOD BEAST is basically a ripoff of Hammer's THE REPTILE which was made the year before. Victorian entymologist (Flemyng) has a daughter (Wanda Ventham - CAPTAIN KRONOS: VAMPIRE HUNTER) who turns into, not a snake woman, but a Death's Head Moth woman. The difference this time around is that the father does it to his daughter himself (rather like Hawthorne's RAPPACINI'S DAUGHTER) instead of it being done to her by outsiders. Cushing is a police inspector investigating a series of bloody murders which have been committed by an unknown assailant. The father is helpful at first but then tries to impede Cushing's progress. Everything builds quite nicely until it's time to fully unveil the monster. Unfortunately the make-up job makes Roger Corman's WASP WOMAN look really high tech and the ending is abrupt and unsatisfactory. This is another fine job from the folks at Redemption with a beautiful transfer of a quality print but most people's reaction will be, why bother?",1383523200,2,1970,4.863095238095238

1359992,4,B00004W195,"In THE BLOOD BEAST TERROR, Peter Cushing (HORROR EXPRESS, THE GHOUL, THE SKULL, THE CREEPING FLESH) plays a police inspector investigating a series of brutal murders. All of the victims are men, and have been drained of blood. So terrible are the attacks, that either a maniac or a wild animal is suspected! As the story unfolds, clues seem to point to a local entomologist and his beautiful daughter. Cushing is his normal, laid-back, totally believable self. He lends credibility to what is otherwise a ludicrous -though extremely enjoyable- monster movie. Sort of an odd combination of THE REPTILE and WASP WOMAN.

1359995,4,B00004W195,"Here we have a good old fashioned Horror movie the likes of which proliferated throughout the Forties and Fifties and because of its mixture of humor and bloodletting, it works marvelously.  Director Vernon Sewell's 'THE BLOOD BEAST TERROR' aka 'THE VAMPIRE BEAST CRAVES BLOOD'-1967 resembles its distant British cousins; Director Sydney J. Furie's 'THE SNAKE WOMAN'- 1960 and Director John Gilling's 'THE REPTILE' -1965  with the daughters of prominent doctors having curses placed on them causing them to transform into snakes but here we have our doctor creating his daughter from a moth/human hybrid with the inevitable disastrous results (we must not forget another distant cousin in Director Roger Corman's 'THE WASP WOMAN'-1957 but the transformation results from bee hormones injected into cold cream ).  The doctor role was to be played by Basil Rathbone but he succumbed to a heart attack two weeks before shooting started.  Producer Tony Tenser had distributed Director Riccardo Freda's brilliant hommage to gothic horror, necrophilia and actress Barbara Steele  'L'ORRIBILE SEGRETO DEL DR. HICHCOCK' aka 'THE HORRIBLE DR. HICHCOCK' -1961 and was able to secure actor Robert Flemyng as our 'mad as a March hare' Dr. Mallinger (but he still is Dr. Hichcock in my book).  Our femme fatale is the beautiful Wanda Ventham who plays our deaths head moth in erotic nympho style and steals the film from everyone involved. She would also slightly steal her way through Writer/Director Brian Clemens's underrated vampire western 'CAPTAIN KRONOS VAMPIRE HUNTER'-1971.  We also have Peter Cushing as the Inspector who supposedly detested the script and decided to insert humor into the dialogue predating actor Thorley Walters blusterly policeman in Director Terence Fischer's masterpiece 'FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED' - 1969 but with less sarcasm but a memorable performance none the less.  The film emerges as an entertaining hoot with the script by Peter Bryan borrowing from many past horrors.  The photography is by future British Sex comedy auteur Stanley A. Long which in this Blu-Ray incarnation really enhances the proceedings.  Director Sewell would go on to direct Boris Karloff's last British film 'CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR' aka 'THE CRIMSON CULT'-1970 with Christopher Lee and Barbara Steele wasting their talents and the frustrating 'BURKE AND HARE'- 1972 which is also released by Redemption in both DVD and Blu-Ray.  Released over a decade ago on DVD by Image Entertainment in a slightly worn transfer, this Redemption disc is light years ahead of it with rich colors and tones presented in its original 1.66 theatrical aspect ratio in eye popping 1080P.  Extras include an original British trailer for the film, other Redemption trailers and a still gallery.

1360000,4,B00004W195,"For anyone who owns the 2000 Image DVD of this movie, or remembers it from TV viewings back in the day, I just wanted to mention that the remastered Redemption Blu-ray is a tremendous improvement over the Image edition. Merely to say that the sharpness/detail, brightness/contrast, color saturation, and color balance are vastly improved would be an understatement. I knew when watching the Image DVD (which I only picked up a year or two ago, damn!) that the quality of the transfer wasn't very good, but I had no idea this movie could ever look this terrific. Besides being in 1.66:1 anamorphic widescreen (in contrast to the letterboxed Image DVD), it's sharp as a tack, much brighter, with excellent contrast and black levels and virtually no speckling or scratches, and reveals far more detail, especially in the darker scenes where the Image transfer just turns to muck.

And the color!! Deeply saturated and vivid, with natural fleshtones and a gorgeous palette of reds, greens, lavenders, and yellows that pop off the screen. It seriously looks like it could have been shot just a few years ago. Not exactly reference quality, but damn near. And if you haven't upgraded to Blu-ray yet, I'm sure the Redemption DVD will still put the Image disc to shame. Cueing up and comparing the two directly made me want to just throw the Image DVD in the trash (though I'll probably give it to someone instead). It's a murky, blurry, speckly, nearly monochromatic mess compared to the Redemption remaster.

And to top off the fabulous transfer, the movie is the uncut British version, running seven minutes and change longer than the Image disc (which was apparently edited for time, not naughty bits or anything like that, sorry) even though they both have the British title and credits at the beginning. Plus, you get trailers for BBT and four other Redemption titles (Virgin Witch, Killer's Moon, Burke and Hare, and The Asphyx) and a modest still gallery.

OK, so it's not the best British horror movie ever made (really more of a mystery with fantastic elements than horror), but Peter Cushing, as always, lends it some class and respectability, and in my book, the rather far-out concept gets a few points for originality, if nothing else. It's not nearly as bad as its reputation either. It's moderately entertaining, especially with the superior picture quality of the remaster, and though Cushing considered it his least favorite film, I've seen him in worse (The Devil's Men/Land of the Minotaur, Blood Suckers, Satanic Rites of Dracula, and The Beast Must Die spring to mind). My biggest complaint with BBT is that the truth behind the mystery is telegraphed way too early in the film, almost from the first scene, essentially destroying any suspense or tension that might have been built up. Bottom line: If you want this movie in your collection for whatever reason, skip the Image release (or dump it if you already have it) and get the Redemption Blu-ray or DVD. I guarantee you won't be disappointed (in the transfer anyway).

1360004,2,B00004W195,"Ignore the most negative of the comments, ""The Blood Beast Terror"" is not total garbage. It has the Hammer Studio's feel which it was trying to imitate; with a decent imitation of the Hammer Victorian production design and a performance by Peter Cushing (as Police Inspector Quennell). It is also features one of the few available film appearances of Vanessa Howard, unfortunately she has only a supporting scream queen role as Quennell's daughter Meg. Check out ""Girly"" if you want to see a lot more of this underutilized actress.

""The Blood Beast Terror's"" main weakness is its low budget which resulted in some horribly lame special effects, although the budget cannot be entirely blamed as just a little imagination in this area would have resulted in something far more effective. It also suffers from a condensed story that does not supply enough scientific details to make the basic premise interesting.

So instead of a sci-fi/horror picture, it is more of a detective story with some laughable horror elements. But it is a decent detective story with enough misdirection to produce several surprising revelations. Contrary to several other comments, I had no problem with the ending, finding the idea of a moth (even a giant one) being drawn to a flame quite appropriate, although so poorly staged as to be groan inducing.

There is some great comic relief in the underplayed performance of Glynn Edwards (as Sergeant Allen) and the overplayed performance of Roy Hudd, as the jaded morgue attendant who casually eats his meals off the slabs in the morgue (complete with cadavers). There is unintended comic relief in the casting of 30 year-old Wanda Ventham as the mad scientist's on-the-make ""teenage"" daughter. Nothing exceptional but a cut above much of the 60's cheap sci-fi and horror.

The only things I enjoyed about it were Peter Cushing, who never turned out a bad performance, and the curious casting of Robert Flemyng -- it wasn't great acting, but his natural bug-eyed features provided an ironic point of interest. The main vampire is a giant moth played unconvincingly by a stuntman in a cape.

The main problem is that the concept isn't executed as well as it could be. SPOILERS: Insect monsters! There's some notable Insect Monster media (The Fly, InSexts, hell even Kafka) that is truly horrifying. I don't think the technology was there to adequately convey the body horror aspect, and the writers could have gone a lot farther with the gender implications. The ending definitely falls flat, and feels very unimpressive. But the detective story leading up to it is interesting! Cushing flexes some of those Sherlock muscles. I'd totally be down for a modern remake of this, in a more explicitly Gothic Horror vein (looking at you, Del Toro).",1486598400,,821,4.956521739130435

7924600,4,B00004W195,"I bought this DVD because it starred Peter Cushing and I thought the premise sounded intriguing.  It takes place in 19th century England.  A series of unsolved murders have occurred in the countryside near London.  The victims were all men of a certain age.  Their throats were torn open and they were drained of every ounce of blood.  The only witness to see the killer was driven insane at the sight of it.  The eyes, the eyes!!!  Prompting Detective Inspector Quennell (Peter Cushing) to get involved.  His investigation leads him to a mad scientist who is always angry at someone for something (hes not above slapping a student for a harmless prank).  It is soon evident that this scientist is not what he claims to be and neither is his so-called daughter (Wanda Ventham).  What are they trying to hide?

Not bad for its type (a pseudo-vampire flick).  At least Peter Cushing was great as always.  But the horror element could have been jazzed up a notch or two more than it was.  Still, it was entertaining.",1475625600,2,1013,4.649717514124294
