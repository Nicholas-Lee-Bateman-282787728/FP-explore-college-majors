8437037,5,B004OBH1BM,"This unusual one-off mini-drama tells the story of one man's life, portrayed by three different actors. Logan Mountstuart is a likeable character. He's a self-proclamined failed writer, who's life happens around him while he struggles to think up his great masterpiece. But his life alone is an entertaining one for the viewer. It intersects with the lives of many real people in history, in fictional circumstances, from before World War II until after the Thatcherite 80's. Logan's appetites, strengths, and weaknesses are met with consequences which will satisfy and entertain viewers. Be warned though - his life is a raunchy one and if on-screen sex and nudity offend you then this mightn't be for you.

The casting is superb. The narrative technique of using flashbacks and flashforwards throughout to paint a picture of a life hook you with intrigue at the beginning, and bid you farewell with pathos at the end. The final scenes are pure visual poetry - moreso on Blu-Ray. The extras are standard fare for such a short mini-series - short interviews on the set - but there could have been more/better disc extras.",1330387200,,1121,4.994652406417113
