7811040,5,6301290895,"This cassette was a big part of my childhood. Though it is only three cartoons, not only is that a perfect running time for a child who won't necessarily pay that much attention for too long a time, but the three cartoons are just great fun. I was watching Michael Clayton recently, and I don't remember why, but the ""Boat Builders"" cartoon popped into my head, and I just started laughing hysterically. And this was all from ""Boat Builders,"" since Michael Clayton is not really a laugh filled movie. I think that giving these cartoons to your kids and letting them have these to grow up on, along with some of the older Winnie the Pooh cartoons like Pooh and the Honey Tree, is the best thing you can do for your kids, because it will give them hours of joy when they are younger and will form a great foundation, much better than The Jonas Brothers or Hannah Montanna or the other garbage that Disney produces these days. Bring your kids back to the better days of Disney. And what's funny is, I am 18 years old, so I am a ""jaded teenager"" and as I have been writing this review, I have been laughing about ""Boat Buddies."" That cartoon just taps into something that is so innocent and so great, that I can't help but laugh hysterically. A great set of cartoons, and almost a must for a child.",1254096000,,1294,4.373443983402489
