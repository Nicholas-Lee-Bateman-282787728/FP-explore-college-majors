3831428,5,B0021AENJG,"Green Lantern: First Flight is an awesome film. It doesn't waste a lot of time on the origin (which takes place in the first few minutes) and heads straight to the action. Some people might see this as detrimental, but I like how the DC animated projects a lot of the time will just assume that you know the basics of what is going on. It saves a lot of time and allows the movie to start getting to the point.

First off, I was surprised at how brutal some of the violence was for this cartoon. I know that these releases are not necessarily tailor-made for children, but this is no JLU episode. People are impaled, shot, torn through walls into the vacuum of space, and there is pretty much non-stop fighting through most of the 120 minutes. I don't have any problem with that, but it might not be to everyone's liking.

Plot-wise, it's not Shakespeare, but we are talking about an action cartoon here. There is a hero, a villain and lots of cool use of the Green Lantern rings. Those were the only prerequisites I was looking for going in to this thing, and I was not disappointed.

The voice cast did a great job as well. If there is one thing that DC always does right, it is casting their voices. Michael Madsen as Kilowog was my personal favorite. Too bad he didn't have more voice time.

This might possibly be my favorite DVD project of theirs, which is saying a lot considering the fantastic Wonder Woman, New Frontier, and Gotham Knight DVD films. I sincerely hope they continue putting out quality releases like this one.",1248307200,71,1533,4.444839857651245
3831429,5,B0021AENJG,"After watching the film and seeing all the other movies of the series I would say that this film was the best of the DC animated films.  It has a incredible plot, although it is not the full origin story of Hal Jordan it doesn't leave you with alot of questions.  Totally worth the wait",1248220800,8,286,4.181818181818182
3831430,1,B0021AENJG,"It's pretty clear that the scriptwriter for this has never read any Green Lantern comics, nor knows anything about the story and characters. Instead, we get a checklist of names and situations borrowed from the comics, and that's it. There is little to no backstory - no training with Kilowog, no explanation of the constructs, and Hal Jordan being a newbie stuck in a world of intergalactic alien adventure is glossed over completely.

The story itself bears little resemblence to anything in the Green Lantern comics, straying considerably from the source material. While this is no bad thing in itself (and comic storylines are endless retold and recycled anyway), it only works if the new story is good. In this case, it isn't, so I'm left wondering why they didn't stick closer to the original.

As a Green Lantern fan, this is very dissappointing. If you know nothing about GL, the GL Corps, and the Guardians, I'd imagine this to be incredibly confusing.

Linear, simplistic, lacking in character, with an illogical and uninteresting storyline, a disregard for the good bits of Green Lantern continuity, and some surprisingly bland direction.

Ironic that it's coming out (July 2009) just as the Green Lantern comic launches into the best story that DC have ever published (Blackest Night, by Geoff Johns). The difference between the two could not be more extreme.

Avoid, at all costs. Even if you're a comic fan, a DC fan, and a GL fan like me, it's really not worth the bother. You'll just end up as confused, frustrated, and unhappy as I am!",1247961600,35,1552,4.863636363636363
3831431,5,B0021AENJG,"I have really be looking forward to this release. I am a big Green Lantern fan. So I was happy to get an early copy of the movie. I am very happy with it. I love it. Best animation DC has done for there home video releases so far in my opinion. Very detailed animation, not just simple outlines like the Justice league animated series, which I love also. The character design is well done, great attention to detail. The green lanterns suits are 10 times more detailed then the Justice league animated versions. Voice acting is great.
They made a great choice in picking Christopher Meloni as the voice of Hal Jordon. He rocks.

As far as story, they show how he he gets is power ring and then it is right into the action. This motion is action packed. I don't mind that we don't a lot of his back story, just enough to get you going, they already did that in The New Frontier movie last year. You get to see hundreds of green lanterns.

I highly recommended this film. I hope they make another Green Lantern movie in the future because I wanna see more of his adventures.",1247875200,15,1072,4.301980198019802
3831432,5,B0021AENJG,"I am a huge fan of Green Lantern, and so was extremely excited to hear that First Flight was the next DC Animated/Warner Premiere DVD. I own ALL of the DCA/WP films so far (including the Watchmen tie-in ""Tales From the Black Freighter"") and have loved them all to varrying degrees. As of right now my favorites in order are Wonder Woman, New Frontier, Batman: Gotham Knights, Superman: Doomsday, and Black Freighter. This movie just changed that and re-affirmed why I love Green Lantern.

First of all I'm a fan of Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. I grew up watch Superfriends, and later Batman: The Animated series and New Adventures of Batman and Superman when Superman's Cartoon came out and episodes interchanged between the two shows. Then was Batman Beyond and finally JL and JLU. WHEW! Well I always liked Green lantern and I was ecstatic when he first showed up on Superman, albeit as an amalgam of Hal and Kyle (Hal Jordan and Kyle Rayner), with Kyle's name and job but Hal's hair and look. I was alittle put off when JL started and it was the John Stewart version, and was disapointed he barely made any constructs with the ring, but as I grew to love the show, I realized that's not the way this John would do things. Finally on The Batman Hal Showed up proper, and yet was still a bit subdued in the use of the ring. But I always said he or any GL should have their own show or movie.

And now they do. This animated version takes it to a new level though. With a brief cover of Hal's origin (as we've already seen that mostly in New Frontier), this is a space epic, with a bit of Training Day thrown in with Hal as the rookie cop, and Sinestro taking him under his wing and showing him the ropes. You can guess where it goes from there. This movie has been called Training Day in space, and yeah that's exactly what it is.

Christopher Meloni and Vicotr Garber as Hal Jordan and Sinestro respectively, are awesome, but Garber steals the show. We really get a sense of his frustration and it's very understandable. But Hal's everyman qualities coupled with his sense of right balance his mentor out...at first. The cast is rounded out byt Michael Madsen voicing Kilowog, Tricia Helfer voicing Boodikka, and Kurtwood Smith voicing a different looking, but more dangerous Kanjar Ro.

The art style is reminicent of the art in Wonder Woman, slightly more anime inspired but with a look that still says American toon. I believe the DCAUniverse (BTAS, Superman, Batman Beyond, JL/JLU) are as close to anime quality work that this country is going to get, and though it has evolved over the last 17 years or so, it has a definitive style. The blocky, angular look that bruce timm pioneered has now become a jumping on point for new art desgners to take that look and add a bit of extra detail. Comicbook artists Ed McGuiness and Clayton Henry are amazing examples of this.

So should you see this movie? I don't know, do you like sci-fi, cool heroes, and kick a$$ action? If yes then by all means buy this.

As a bonus the preview for the next DCA/WP DVD is on there. Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, based on the first arc of the comic of the same name written by Jeph Loeb, and drawn by the afore mentioned Ed Mcguiness. Another film I can't wait for as, just with New Frontier, they're mimicking McGuiness' art.",1247616000,6,3332,4.526578073089701
3831433,5,B0021AENJG,"The new batch of DC Original Animated movies, with mastermind and prodigious artist Bruce Timm at the helm, are true and unique pieces of visual art.

A movie for everyone who likes comics, animation, cop dramas and epic storytelling.",1246579200,36,402,5.014925373134329

3831436,5,B0021AENJG,"What? Another DC movie that doesn't feature Batman or Superman? As much as I love those two characters, its great to have another hero in the limelight for a change in his own movie. But is it as epic as Wonder Woman's?

While New Frontier already did Hal Jordan's origin, its briefly done in the opening before the main story. It works since, if you saw the other movie or know the story already, we can speed things along for Jordan to get into space. If only they did that for Superman's origin. How many times have audiences sat through that? Let's see;

1941- Fleischer cartoons
1948- Kirk Alyn Serial
1951- George Reeves TV series
1978- Superman I
1980- opening credits recap in Superman II
1988- Superboy TV series
1993- Dean Cain TV series
1996- Superman: TAS
2001- Smallville
and I'll bet that in the reboot movie, we'll get it again!

Anyway, its good to have the movie set almost entirely in space. Back in the Silver Age, most of Hal's adventures did occur in space, so its nice to have Timm bring that into the film. Also of note that we finally see Sinestro while he was a Green Lantern. His fighting prowess near the end proves that he was the greatest Lantern. But of course he is corrupted by power and his need to rule the universe, but I love his little speeches when he tells Jordan why he thinks the Guardians have grown soft over the millenia and why he thinks they need a new order.

What I think gives the movie an edge compared to Doomsday and Wonder Woman is that I'm not reminded of the DCAU models in any way. When I see these ""original"" movies, I want to see something different than what I've seen before, but not radically different like what we got with Gotham Knight. Though the armored look of the Lantern suits put me off a bit when I first saw the previews, but I've grown to like them. Sinestro's upgraded yellow suit is also impressive but also retains a bit of the classic look as well. The different aliens and worlds that were seen was also impressive. The animators must love getting to design the aliens and starships (which was also seen in Superman: TAS and JL) instead of always drawing humans.

The voice cast is again perfection. Christopher Meloni's performance isn't the deep bass voice from Challenge of the Super Friends nor does it sound like David Boreanaz's. He plays him like as someone who challenges authority but also as a courageous man with a sense of humor. Victor Garber was excellent as Sinestro, making me almost believe that what he was doing was good. He was evil without being too obvious like Ted Levine's performance in Superman and JL (though he was good, don't get me wrong). Another Madsen is present in this (Andrea Romano must like working with them) and I think his version of Kilowag is a little gruffer than what we got in JL (who always seemed like he was dumb). I was shocked to hear Malachi Throne (who actually played the villain False Face in the Adam West Batman series), as I thought he had retired, the last voice role I heard him in was Batman Beyond. But nonetheless, he was good too.",1243468800,,3072,4.488372093023256

He's carried off to a crash site where he encounters a critically wounded alien, whom then offers him a mysterious green ring. The ring fits itself to Jordan's finger transforming him into a green and black clad warrior, in addition the ring also gives him various powers. He soon receives a visit from others wearing the same uniform explaining to him that he's become one of the protectors of the Universe called a Green Lantern. He's then taken away to the planet of Oa where he's briefed by the Guardians of the Universe on his purpose, and placed under the wing of their most powerful Green Lantern, Sinestro. -summary

The Emerald hero known as Green Lantern for reasons unknown has always been overshadowed by DC's big three; Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman despite being just as cool as they are. Some would even argue that he's actually better than the three. I won't go that far in regards to the first two, but I will say that I was always fascinated by him and I was amazed to hear he was getting his own animated feature back then. Although this movie suffers from a few short comings here and there, I think it was an above decent work. Green Lantern: First Flight is the fifth movie in the DC animated original movies line up and it's directed by Lauren Montgomery, and for some strange reason, it still feels like he got shafted with that 75 minute run time.

The plot follows Hal Jordan, Sinestro, and the Green Lantern Corps as they search for the whereabouts on a power source called the Yellow Element which was stolen from the Guardians of the Universe. Should the Yellow Element fall into the wrong hands, then this could spell disaster since yellow is the Green Lantern's weakness. I was never bored with the plot, as it contained a good amount of character development, and some imaginative action scenes that were well placed. Every battle seemed to escalate a little more in terms of violence, creativity, and excitement, with the final battle being a real good pay off.

The film centers around the most well known and popular Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, and make no mistake, he comes off as that space cowboy, and displays that swashbuckling persona quite often. I enjoyed his creative use with the ring in battle, and this slight amount of character development is what set him apart from the rest of the Green Lantern corp. While a majority of them were mainly using their rings for energy beam attacks and lassos; Jordon would come up with over-sized golf clubs and fly swatters for bug like creatures. This revealed a more comical side to his personality which I found refreshing for the serious atmosphere.

For every good hero, there has to be a good villain, and Sinestro pretty much defines the term bad-assery. He's very well developed and comes off as a character with a lot of depth. He doesn't seek universal domination for petty reasons, and this is some of what sets him apart from many bad guys. To include, his ruthlessness and ""by any means necessary"" attitude is a plus.

Although I find the movie to be pretty entertaining it does suffer from an undercooked story, that even casual fans whom are not familiar with the characters will be able to pick up. I feel the length of the movie played a role in this, and at times it was kind of hard to believe the things that Jordan was capable of. I won't go into detail as to avoid big spoilers.

The action scenes are well animated and the backgrounds are very pretty, with some nice colors and the CG blended in pretty well. I also thought the character designs were nice, and I liked the small addition of the armored look to Hal's uniform. The soundtrack does enhance the mood, and I really did like the electronica song that played in the club with the light keys and bass in the background. I can't say anything bad about the voice acting but I have to mention Victor Garber did a splendid job with Sinestro all around. He combined that menacing nature with his authoritative stature that I thought was really cool.

Another thing that I enjoyed about the film was the sci-fi setting which set it apart from the usual superhero flavor, that we normally get from Batman and Superman every time. Overall, this is still a fun film and I doubt the flaws will bug most folks. Is it the best DC has to offer? Not by a long shot, but it's good enough to hope for a few sequels and another series or two.

Cons: Underdeveloped story",1428451200,,4581,4.624846248462485

I've never read the comics, but from what I understand, the movies stick very close to them. This particular story was very intriguing.  I always liked the Green Lantern, but never really knew Hal Jordan's character. My only issue was the intro seemed really rushed.  Hal gets the ring, and is apparently really fluent with it, with no training (montage anyone?) or anything. Regardless, the story was packed with action, with a good twist at the end.

One thing I've noticed is that the DC movies seem a little more brutal and violent then when I was younger. I don't know if I just pay more attention now, or if it really has changed, either way, I still enjoy the movies.",1418688000,,840,4.428571428571429

There's a good amount of character development for Green Lantern Hal Jordan as well.  You get to see more of the Green Lantern Corp. and not just the 'main character.'  I think the plot had some great twists and although the ending was kinda cheesy the movie itself as a whole was a good experience.

I also want to state this is definitely not a kids show.  There is blood and death so I wouldn't recommend it for young kids, like under 13.",1393459200,,616,4.1344537815126055

Side note: I was not overly impressed with the live action green lantern movie with Ryan Reynolds, I actually thought this was better.",1391731200,,459,4.337209302325581
3831520,4,B0021AENJG,"The first thing to note is that this movie is only loosely based on prior Green Lantern stories, particularly those of the past few years. You have to forget what you know of the legend when you watch this movie and take it on its own terms as an independent story.

The basic origin is the same, with Hal Jordan as a test pilot who is selected by a dying Abin Sur to be his replacement as the newest member of the Green Lantern Corps. Hal is subsequently summoned to Oa to be vetted by the Guardians, who are skeptical about the wisdom of trusting a primitive Earthman with the ring. Sinestro, then one of the most valued members of the Corps, intercedes, stating that he'll take Hal under his wing and evaluate him.

Jordan and Sinestro go after the character who was responsible for Abin Sur's death. Sinestro takes Jordan to a dive bar full of rejects and scum, looking for the girlfriend of the killer. Sinestro tortures her until Jordan intervenes. Conveniently, the killer shows up at that point, then runs off with the two Lanterns in hot pursuit. After an extended fight, Jordan captures the killer. When Sinestro catches up, he's furious, angry that Jordan intervened, and he goes into an extended rant that reveals much about his character and sets up the events of the rest of the movie.

Sinestro: ""A thief here, a killer there. Scum, dirt, filth! There's no end to it, but there could be. It's my dream that one day all of this rot will be wiped away. A new order will prevail, one that will end the chaos but it won't be built by the faint of heart. You got soft on me back there, Earth boy, and that I will not tolerate.""

Back on Oa, Jordan is approached by Boodikka, who gives him the lowdown on the current crisis the Corps is facing. In the early days of the universe, the Guardians created the central power battery, powering it with ""the green element,"" considered the strongest power source in the universe. The green element, however, has one weakness: the yellow element, which the Guardians hid away in another universe. The yellow element has been found and stolen by Kanjar Ro, threatening the Guardians, the Corps, the entire universe.

Not all is as it seems in this movie, with a few more surprises and plot twists before we get to the primary conflict at the heart of this movie. And quite a conflict it is, with non-stop action and some innovative battle sequences before all is said and done. To say any more would give away too much of the plot. Let's just say that they foreshadow the ending with this quote: ""One slight imperfection... the imperfection every weapon has. Its user.""

There are some plot holes in the story and a few scenes that should have been extended. For example, we are never told just what the green and yellow elements are and why the former is vulnerable to the latter. Nor why the yellow element seems to have an intelligence of its own. I should also note that there are a couple of disturbing scenes in this film, including one fairly graphic impaling sequence, so you should probably screen this before letting a young child view it.

The graphics in this movie are good but I have to ding them for two things: the faces tend to be a bit angular and square-jawed, enough to distract a bit, and the CGI is a little too obviously CGI, and it's not as well-integrated with the hand-drawn animation as it is in some of the other animated films. The voice acting is very good, with Christopher Meloni and Victor Garber doing a fine job as Hal Jordan and Sinestro, respectively.

I liked the film but there are just enough flaws here to take away one star. Overall, though, I liked it and can recommend it.",1391558400,2,3665,4.509036144578313

3831524,4,B0021AENJG,"This was a pretty fantastic journey as a viewer. I never got lost in useless side plots, everything came together, and the action was great. Sometimes these films can get lost in the idea that the only people watching them are familiar with the characters or the universe but I felt like this film rode that line between Origin story (to fit in with the way DC is presenting their characters now) and more advanced story telling. I really think DC is beating Marvel when it comes to their animated films.

I've always known about the Green Lantern ever since the Justice League animated series first came on TV but it wasn't until the live action Green Lantern movie and game that I really started to get into him. It was really weird because it seemed to come out of nowhere. Anyway I started ordering a bunch of Green Lantern stuff and this was among them.

I thought the movie was a pretty cool, action packed movie. The only thing that kind of bothered me was that when Hal gets the ring it's like he already knows how to use it right as he puts it on. Now as I said before I'm pretty new to the Green Lantern universe so unless that's how the ring works it just didn't seem right to me since in the live action movie he had to learn how to use the powers. As you get further in the movie it's like he already becomes a Green lantern god within like just a couple days of being a Green Lantern. That was pretty much my only complaint about the movie everything else was cool and it was fun to watch.",1389744000,,1073,4.109523809523809

3831537,4,B0021AENJG,"If they had made this the movie rather than the Ryan Reynolds movie it may have sold better. The movie works as both an origin story for the Hal Jordan Green Lantern as well as an evil Sinestro origin story. The movie has a quick pace to it (as it clocks in at just over an hour) and never really slows down. It does blow over any training Hal Jordan needed or received, but does show the motivations Sinestro had to turn to evil. The animation is fair with some CGI tossed in here and there. The extras are pretty descent also with short back stories on Sinestro and the Guardians plus some longer shorts about the mythology of the Green Lantern and the ring (the ring one is pretty long for a short). There are also some shorts about other DC movies that are better than just trailers and 5 episodes of JL Unlimited.

Gets the feel good moments of the corp from the comic.  Not totally in line with the comic story of course, but since when does Hollywood ever get a book or comic story adapted to film without screwing something up??!  Lord of the Rings was horribly wrong compared to the books plot lines.  It didn't diminish those movies at all, and it doesn't here either.  This story is full of action, betrayal, conspiracy and the heroic tradition of the Corp.  Very enjoyable to watch and much better than the live action movie that was a steaming hot pile of brown doo doo.  Yes it's animated, yes the story is good, the action is good and it's worth buying especially at this price.  Someone in another review said that the soundtrack was terrible and not good to listen to.  I've been a fan of movie soundtracks for many years, and I think it can add so much to a movie experience.  I purchased the movie sound track separately from the movie because it was absolutely fantastic!

3831597,4,B0021AENJG,Pretty good movie. This is what the green lantern should have been. Instead of having two villains like parallax (totally undermined as a character they used him like galactus in the ff4 2 movie) and hector hammond a big weird giant head villain along with rushing sinestro at the end to a villain. They need to show a journey in a origin story about how a villain becomes a villain like in first flight where you see why sinestro wants to be a villain. Especially when you have a character like green lantern that most of the audience doesn't know who he is and most people thought that john stewart was the green lantern from the dcau. The movie needed to have a more focused character narrative. In the next green lantern reboot i would go with john stewart or kyle rayner.,1372636800,,776,4.471830985915493
3831598,4,B0021AENJG,"When I first started watching Green Lanter: First Flight, I found myself a little underwhelmed as to how quickly Hal learned to master the use of the ring. This is the one instances where I feel that Hal learning how to control the ring in the Ryan Reynolds movie, was executed better than in the animated one. But that is the ONLY exception to the rule.

But then Sinestro showed up, and that's when things really started kickin' into gear. Instead of focusing on Hal learning how to use the ring, the movie instead decided to focus on the birth of Sinestro and his yellow power. There were times in this movie where I was in complete shock, when all the green lantern rings came back to the homeworld, I was like... ""no way."" Sinestro had killed almost a hundred lantern in one fell swoop and it was really shocking to watch.

Even though you know the good guys always win, the movie kept you on the edge of your seat wondering HOW the good guys were going to win. There was no Deus Ex machina to save the day, it was all Hal and his friend Kilowogg. My only complaint for this movie would be that Hal was kind of bland. Even though he had some great one-liners like, ""I just learned this thing yesterday."" He just didn't feel memorable.

Either way, this is definitely a fun movie to watch for a boring Saturday.",1372550400,,1315,4.359183673469388

Like a lot of comic book movies, First Flight draws elements from different stories to try to form something that stands on it's own while capturing the spirit of the source material.  This isn't the classic version of Hal's origin, but it is a highly entertaining story with a strong central plot and a good selection of supporting Core members.  The voice acting is top notch (particularly for Hal and Sinestro) and the animation up to DC's usual high standards for these releases.  There is a decent little bunch of extras (though nothing spectacular) but honestly I got this for the movie and am judging the release on that.

First Flight delivers what it advertises: a good animated film focused on Hal's ""trial by fire"" as a new Green Lantern.  Not necessarily for purists or those looking for perfection, but worth a watch otherwise.",1356393600,,1114,4.857142857142857

It starts with Hal becoming GL before the opening credits and then he goes to Oa briefly before the action starts.  It's non-stop to the point of being boom-boom-boom, but I like the pace.  It definitely never gets boring.  Sure, there are a few things that could be explained more, but there are other GL stories for that.  (no ""slow"" stuff like Hal getting trained)  The plot is exciting and the writing is mature, hence the PG-13 rating.

From the reviews read here and on other sites, I was a little let down from high expectations. Probably just another casualty of a WB mandate to keep everything under 80 minutes, but it just doesn't deliver any higher than good. I found nothing special about Hal Jordan, why the ring deemed him worthy, how he was able to master it's use immediately, etc. The threat and progression to the villain were nothing very original, but understandable... and well OK. I'm guessing the accolades may be due to use of tone/action grittier than most animated fare of this genre.

A revision of the canon origin story still rocks the screen to a black-vs-white good guy/space cop... kinda like a Jedi, but without the daddy issues from the newer trilogy. Here, we meet Hal Jordan. The story quickly leaves planet Earth with a quick flight leading to Oa, the planet at the centre of the universe. Corrupt Lantern looms in the shadows and finally comes to a head and has a great 'boss fight' ending.

This was the best foot forward to introduce the Green Lantern Mythos to a new generation of eager fans. Christopher  Meloni (Law and Order SVU) voices Hal, with Victor Garber (Alias) voicing Sinestro and they bring in the perfect pitch of each of the characters.

As the other DCU features, there is a spotlight of up-and-coming DC projects, a featurette with Geoff Johns, and the same sort of things we've seen from previous films (Blackest Night preview, choice episodes, etc.). Despite this, the film itself deserves 5-stars just for doing an awesome job with a character not familiar to the vast audience of readers. Green Lantern has never been a top-tier character.

No need to go in depth and it worked. It was a better idea to use most of the film's running time on the conflict between Hal Jordan's role in the Corp and Sinestro's agenda. Then there are the Guardians and how everything the Lanterns stand for comes from them.

Basically, this is an origin story, specifically, Hal Jordan's entry into the ranks of the Green Lanterns, and Sinestro's eventual betrayal by claiming the Yellow Lantern. Like i say, it's not horrible, and you'll probably enjoy it at least a little, but i had to turn it off out of boredom at one point and finish it later.

3831637,4,B0021AENJG,"I wasn't thrilled by the recent live-action Green Lantern movie.  So it's something of a relief that ""Green Lantern: First Flight"" gives a more cohesive origin story for Roy Harper that DOESN'T involve cosmic diarrhea. It would have benefited from another half hour, but it's a vibrant, action-packed adventures with plenty of epic battles.

Ace pilot Hal Jordan (Christopher Meloni) is in a flight simulator when he's suddenly dragged deep into the desert, where a dying alien gives him a green ring and the title of ""Green Lantern."" That evening, the Green Lantern Corps arrives to take Hal off to the planet of Oa, where he finds that the ancient Guardians -- and several of the Lanterns -- are not happy about a human joining their ranks.

And with the guidance of Sinestro (Victor Garber), Hal discovers more about the Green Lantern powers -- it turns out that their only vulnerability is the ""yellow element."" He also learns that his predecessor, Abin Sur, was killed by galactic warlord Kanjar Ro (Kurtwood Smith), who has also stolen the yellow element. When Kanjar Ro is found dead, Hal is the main suspect -- but he begins to suspect that Sinestro is up to something sinestrer!

I wish the live-action Green Lantern movie had been more like this one. It's a fast-paced, straightforward introduction to Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps, without much clutter or filler. I have no idea how faithful it is to any of the Green Lantern comics, but even non-comic-book-fans should be able to understand what the heck is going on.

So we get a lot of colorful alien worlds, expansive space stations and strange looking creatures, climaxing in a giant floating yellow battery blasting through Oa. It's also not a very kid-friendly cartoon, since it has scenes of torture, many Green Lanterns are killed, and there's even a fun scene where Sinestro reanimates a dead guy who has a GIANT HOLE punched through his abdomen. It's not very graphic, but punches aren't pulled.

However, there are a few problems. The pace sometimes goes too quickly (Hal masters his ring in LITERALLY a few minutes) and the finale centers around an unexplained deus ex machina. It's as if they went, ""Nobody can beat Sinestro! Uh... here's a green crystal thingy.""

But they do a pretty good job with the characters. Hal Jordan is a solid if slightly generic hero with a good, kind heart (he stops to help up a random alien up after he trips), and there's some nice development for the various Green Lanterns like gruff Kilowog and Abin Sur, and even for Kanjar Ro. Sinestro's development is especially good -- he's determined to establish his ""new order,"" which fuels his ambition and hatred of the Guardians.

""Green Lantern: First Flight"" is a solid introduction to the world of the Green Lantern Corps, and it doesn't have Blake Lively either. So, win-win!",1310688000,,2843,4.8353909465020575

First, there are lots for ten year olds to enjoy as the movie never stops for a breath and the special effects will send young kids into a bug-eyed frenzy.  Also, and I'm assuming here, the sound track is directed at Kids between six and twelve years of age, which leaves everyone else wondering if they're being herded for colonization.  So much for the positive aspects of the movie.

For everyone past the age of twelve, they probably would enjoy the movie if the soundtrack was close to being listenable and the actors had not been put in a position of spouting lines with no logical reference to what was happening around them.

3831642,4,B0021AENJG,"With two Green Lantern films on the horizon, I thought it was about time I finally wrote a review for Green Lanterns first official solo debut. While originally I didn't like it too much, watching it again I found it much more agreeable. I must have not been in a good mood to watch it originally.

People call this ""Green Lantern: Training Day,"" Sinestro is a veteran cop taking Hal Jordan under his wing. Immediately, what I like is the fact that it doesn't waste any time, after the first 10-minutes, Hal is in space and the story gets going. Originally, I didn't like Kanjar-Ro, the sneaky villain of the story, but now that I've read more about him, I can at least tell that the characterization is correct. Meanwhile, Sinestro comes out really great as a soldier that can barely hide the fact that he's waiting for his chance to come out on top.

Victor Garber is the perfect voice for Sinestro. And Christopher Meloni is an okay Hal Jordan. (I still like David Boreanaz better.) The film is not an adaptation of any specific graphic novel, instead it's an amalgamation of different tales including the origin, Green Lantern Rebirth, and the Sinestro Corps War. And it works really well, all the complicated stuff with ""Parallax"" is removed, but the core story remains. Since it's not an adaptation they created their own art style.

For the extras they were pretty good.

""Sneak Peak at Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" which at this point is already out.

""Behind the Scenes of Blackest Night"" is a promo with Geoff Johns (writer on Green Latern) about the DC event ""Blackest Night."" It's okay, but they should have listed what books a person should read to build up Blackest Night.

""Behind the Story with Geoff Johns"" Eight minutes with Geoff Johns briefly going over the Green Lantern character.

Character Profiles for Sinestro & the Guardians of the Universe.

Duck Dodgers - Green Loontern. A nice surprise, a bonus cartoon of Duck Dodgers becoming a member of the Green Lantern Corps.

Bruce Timm Cartoons - Justice League ""Once and Future Thing"" Part 1 & 2.

Trailers for Wonder Woman, Batman Gotham Knight, and Justice League: the New Frontier pad out the disk.

So, it's a pretty good DVD set, but it's not perfect. I'm scoring it a 4 out of 5 because this was the first time they didn't include a commentary track. Plus the Justice League episodes they chose suck, they only chose them because Hal Jordan randomly appears for a minute. They should have chosen ""In Blackest Night,"" and ""Hearts and Minds.""

If you want a good movie that basically revolves entirely around the green Lantern's origin go watch Justice League: New Frontier.

Long story short Hal Jordan is sought out by a dieing alien and given his ring of power based on his honesty and fearlesness. No other human has ever received this honor so the council and other members of the lantern corps want to test him to see if he is truly worthy. An honored lantern called Sinestro (spoiler alert: They guy named Sinestro is the bad guy) who is tired of the gentle political means of bringing justice takes him along on a mission. And events spill out of control.

Think a green lantern animated version of Training Day (Denzel Washington). Honestly I don't think it would have hurt to put just a little more detail in the actual origin but it's not necessary by any means.",1290902400,2,1265,4.5394736842105265

However, they seem to leave their explanations at half-mast, telling you just enough so you understand but not enough to develop it into something really unique and interesting.  It's a little like ""here's the ring, here's the battery, it's powered by this green rock.  Got it? Let's go kick alien butt!""  Seeing as it takes place almost entirely in outer space, First Flight is unique when compared to the other animated features.  I liked the character development, I really believed it was Hal Jordan's human ingenuity and determination that made him so powerful.  Sinestro is handled very well and his character arc is one of the best things in the film.

While an entertaining space opera adventure, First Flight simply lacks the congruency to make it a great animated feature. I was willing to cut it some slack, but my wife made a good argument that the audience needed more explanation about how the Green Lantern and Yellow Lantern batteries work, how they can fly around and shoot stuff, and how they're related to the individual rings themselves. Apparently this discrepancy is because First Flight draws on knowledge and events from the comic series, which is okay, but it goes largely unexplained.

Pilot Hal Jordan goes for the ride of his life when his test pod is mysteriously transported from the safety of an airforce hanger to a rocky desert only to encounter a bizarre dying alien named Abin Sur, who had summoned Jordan via his powerful. Abin Sur dies and Hal's world is turned upside down and he is introduced to the Green Lantern Corps, guardians of the galaxy. Under the tutelage of Sinestro, Hal learns to use his newfound power and witness, thanks to Sinestro's words and actions, that the Guardians of Oa--those who created the Green Lantern Corps and the green lantern power battery--have grown soft in their approach to intergalactic crime. Sinestro believes a more stern approach is needed and so takes Hal under his wing to show him that might makes right.

The Corps faces a crisis as the Yellow Element--the only force capable of weakening the Green Element, which powers the Corps's green battery on Oa--has been stolen. Should it be used against them, the Green Lantern Corps will crumble and the galaxy as we know it will no longer be protected and chaos and evil will reign.

Green Lantern, to me, has always been a cool character, yet he's also always been an overlooked character outside the realm of us hardcore superhero guys. Batman? Sure. Superman? We know him even better. Spider-Man? Yeah, good movies on the big screen. But Green Lantern? Wasn't he that green guy from that old Super Friends show, the one with that ring that does stuff and, um, well . . .

Green Lantern is an outside character. He's known and he's unknown. I think of him like Superman, the difference being is he takes the ring off and he's a guy like you and me. Superman doesn't have that option because no matter what kind of clothes he's wearing, he'll always be a Kryptonian. Green Lantern: First Flight reminds us of that: that beneath the cool power ring Hal Jordan is just your average guy.

I really appreciated the origin tone of this movie and even more so that 99% of it didn't take place on Earth. Here we got to get a solid look at the world of Green Lantern, which is an intergalactic one and not confined to a bustling Metropolis or an eerie Gotham.

To see the Green Lantern Corps--all those aliens with varied green uniforms--really added to the scope of what the Corps is all about and a visual reminder that humanity's protection is only a small part of what they do. According to this movie, there are 3600 green lanterns, each with their own sector to watch over. Solid.

I had only a couple minor quibbles with this movie. I thought Hal Jordan dove into the Green Lantern thing rather quickly. He gets the ring and suddenly--BAM--he's all green and knows what to do. He also seemed too casual and calm about all these alien encounters he suddenly finds himself having. If that was you or me, we'd be freaking out the second Abin Sur showed up, green ring or otherwise.

Likewise, Hal Jordan seemed to be the only guy who got back to wearing regular clothes when the ring came off, whereas everyone else still retained their uniform. I thought the uniform came with the ring. Take the ring off and you're back to wearing whatever it was when you put it on.

Again, minor, but something I would have liked to have seen handled better.

I know that comic books and comic book movies are not as much for kids as they used to be. Once again this DC film has some foul language in it. Not impressed because it's kids asking their moms for these flicks. It's not like the old days where superhero cartoons were clean language-wise.

The action is great. The fights are cool.

If Green Lantern: First Flight is meant as a primer for the upcoming live action film, man, we're in for a real treat and an awe-inspiring experience coming 2011.

This flick is solid, enjoyable and fun. Check it out.

this Green Lantern movie is good, but not great. I liked the animation, parts of the story, and other elements.
the movie quickly retells the orgin story and then has Hal Jorden taken to Oa to be trained, and he is quickly caught in intriuge and treachery.

again the animation is good, and the story has epic fights. there were some good elements to this movie that I enjoyed.

my probleam were the chartures. very few were well devloped. Kiliwog for example is pretty basic. most of the others are rudimentary chartures or two dimensional at least. none seem very well devloped.

worst of all is that I could never get a grasp on Hal Jorden. I feel i didn't get to know anything about him.

it doesnt help that because his orgin was retold in J.L.A. New Frontier the producers didn't want to delve into that back story, which is a shame because maybe if they did we could have gotten to know Jorden a bit better.
for this movie i just felt i didn't know anything about him.

one critic said that the producers spend more time getting Jordan into space then making him a charture and I agree.

in point of fact Sinestro is the most well devloped charture and the most well acted. hence the title of the this review. in the inteir movie he is the most interesting charture, and the one most well rounded one.
as well as the most interesting one.

he outshines Jorden at everymoment.
all the while Jordan just stands around and doesent do much of anything.

This wasn't a bad movie, it had nice action sceans and so on. again I liked Sinsestro in this movie.
i just felt that alot of the chartures, espeisly Hal Jordon, were not well rounded.

i hope that the producers of the live action movie will do a better job.

on another note. i have to say for once this is one time that i did not want the two disc version.

the extra episodes are rather random. sure a few have Jordan in a cameo role.
but there really is alot more they could have added.

something like an old Suprfriends episode. or even the Green Lantern Filmation episodes.
something more interesting then what they did pick.

ah well.",1272067200,,2278,4.392857142857143

While the Justice League Unlimited episodes are presented in full HD, the 2 eps. from the first series are in SD and require viewers to hit their HDTV's Format button to zoom in and fill the screen, which isn't a big issue.

For the comic vets, all of your favorite characters from the comics lore are here in some way shape or form but since this is essentially a Hal Jordan story, don't expect to see any references to Kyle Raynor, John Stewart, and Guy Gardner (thank God for no Gardner :P).  While I don't completely agree with how they played Hal as a bit of a rebel in this movie, it made complete sense in the context of the story and how the other characters were handled.  Seeing Sinestro being so ""bad-arse"" and actually seeing the reverence the entire corp had for him was nice as well since he's never been fully explored in animated form before.  This movie almost made you feel sorry for him and that's a sign of good story telling.

Well, I'm very glad I bought it and it is a welcome addition to my collection.  I bought it recently and already watched it several times.

Some might have a problem with it's lack of origin development, but I think the ""quick get things started right away"" choice was a good one in this case.  The animation/art design worked, and shined in many places.  The music was gripping and emotive, and added to the intensity of the Green Lantern story, the mystique, the sheer epic nature of the tale.  And of course, we come to the rings.  There must have been over 20 different uses of the ring's power.  No spoilers here, you will have to watch and enjoy discovering how the rings get used for yourself.  The movie is fun and far out while remaining understandable, but is very violent and gory at times, so it is not really suited for young children.

3831673,5,B0021AENJG,"Green Lantern is one of those characters in the DC Universe that never got the respect that other DC superheroes got via TV series, movied, or prime billing in cartoons.  So unless you're a hardcore GL comics reader, you might not have a good background on the Green Lantern character or mythology.

Don't worry !  This is a top-flight Blu-Ray disc in both substance and style.  Their is plenty of action, great fight scenes, funny lines, and a tight, compact story.  The origins of the Green Lantern Corps, the Green Lantern and Guardians mythology, the green vs.yellow battle -- it's all covered.  The story moves very fast and you will not find yourself saying 'come on, come on, get to the good stuff.'  The 1080p Blu-Ray Hi-Def production doesn't disappoint and on my Sony 460 Blu-Ray player and a 720p 2006 model plasma, the colors and animation stood out with amazing brilliance.  I understand that some characters in the comics are not featured here and a few disappear in this story and timeline, but I'll leave that debate to the GL purists.

There are some nice features on the BR disc, including some nice episodes from Justice League Unlimited that feature the Green Lantern (John Stewart, though).  Special features from the people behind the cartoons, the movie, and the Green Lantern comics make for interesting reading for GL novices and experts.

All in all, a top-notch Blu-Ray addition that you will definitely put in the player again after you've seen the movie the first time.  You'll find yourself fast-forwarding to the numerous action sequences, conflicts, and the spectacular climactic ending battle numerous times.  Let's hope that DC comes out with a worthy sequel featuring the same voice actors and actresses.  This is one of the top if not THE top animation movies from either DC or Marvel that has been put out to date and you will NOT be disappointed.",1264636800,2,1884,4.846875
3831674,3,B0021AENJG,"This movie is a tough one to review. I always try to review movies in the context of what they were attempting to do, e.g. a slapstick comedy cannot be compared to a drama. That said, hard to tell what they were going for here. Maybe its a cartoon movie just for 18-24 year olds? If that is the case, its a narrow demographic target.
I won't go into the whole fanboy argument of how much fidelity this has for the comic book established material. I think they did an OK job of capturing the mythos of GL. I would have liked to have seen them go a bit further though. Iron Man gave a fresh treatment to the IM material. GL is something that really calls out for a fresh take. The GL corps always struck me as too much ST the Next Generation. People are too comfortable with aliens, bad food jokes aside. There should be more genuine wonder to alien civs. This is more a fault of the source material though and not the movie.
The biggest problem I have with this movie is that GL should be a kid's movie. A lot of parents want to pass on characters they grew up with. This movie contains some graphic torture, heaps of bloody deaths and impalements with copious blood. When this stuff is needed for a story, I am ok with it-but the graphic blood seems extraneous to the story. With a bit of editing, there is no reason they could not have made this a kid friendly movie.
The voice acting was pretty good. I liked the way they crafted Sinestro's personality and motivations. He is portrayed as kind of a mini-Stalin-he just wants to bring order to an unruly galaxy even if he has to murder everyone in his way.
The smurfs come across as pretty lame, they should have seemed more grand and omniscient.",1262390400,,1697,4.30625

There is even a scene where he must survive without his ring. I just felt the movie captured that key point of him being a hero regardless of the humongous power and responsibility placed upon him. I also liked how it showed his resourcefulness as a ""mere"" human, reminiscent of the Flash Gordon theme. All in all I felt it also had a decent use of humor and drama.

Which is a shame, b/c any good movie follows SOME kind of logic, and Green Lantern's world has benefited in the past by wit (a Superman episode using 2nd-tier Lantern Kyle Rainer comes to mind) and has most certainly suffered in the past without it (the John Stewart Green Lantern of the Justice League cartoon).

In brief, the film jumps right into the action, turning pilot Hal Jordon into superhero Green Lantern within the first 10 or 15 minutes. While that might sound fun, you end up with no emotional connect with the character. Imagine if Iron Man was missing the first 25 minutes or the first two Spider-Man movies were missing the first 30 -- that's what we have here.

While we see a host of characters fans have clamored for, and the voice work and casting is truly EXCELLENT (including an interestingly cast John Larroquette [Night Court, Boston Legal]), it does nothing to help this brainless actioner be anything but 2nd-rate ideas live-action action directors Roland Emerich or Michael Bay would have tossed aside.

3831680,5,B0021AENJG,"Green Lantern: First Flight presents us the origin of Hal Jordan becoming Green Lantern. For those not well-versed in the comics history, the initial development is very much in line with the classic origin from the DC Comic many decades ago. A spaceship crashes on Earth with a dying alien on board. This alien commands his ring to find a worthy replacement. This worthy individual is test pilot Hal Jordan.

Jordan quickly finds himself caught up in cosmic-scale events, as the Green Lantern Corps arrest him for possessing the ring without permission of the overseers of the Corps. Jordan faces the accusation that he is unworthy and quickly proves himself to be a natural at wielding the ring, despite his inexperience. He is embroiled in a conspiracy that reaches to very high levels in the Corps, but his own innate talent and determination allow him to overcome great odds in pursuit of true justice.

While the story is not exactly in line with the comic origin of Hal as Green Lantern, this movie does go far to show why he was regarded as the greatest Lantern ever, since despite his inexperience he takes on and defeats the prior claimant to that title. There are a number of violent deaths in this movie, so it's not exactly intended for small kids to watch though they surely see worse in video games these days.

This is a fantastic story told with wonderful animation that surpasses all the other movies in the line thus far. Even with voice actors who I would not have chosen, the creators delivered in First Flight a wonderful origin story for one of the core DCU characters.",1258243200,2,1592,4.698924731182796

The movie follows a tale of corruption, betrayal and intrigue that begins with a brief origin story for Hal Jordan, and features a great deal of Sinestro, the classic fallen Lantern.  The Green Lantern Corps are depicted to be reminiscent of the Jedi in the Star Wars Universe.

The best scenes were the amazing chase sequences that begin in a seedy tavern on some distant planet, filled with rogue aliens (sound familiar?).

The voice acting is pretty good throughout, and the storytelling has a distinct psychological edge to it that makes some of the plot twists hit home that much harder.

Anyway, as you might surmise, I was disappointed in this animated movie.  I expected a better treatment of Hal Jordan, the person and the superhero.  Instead, we got the life story of Sinestro and a story of battle involving the entire Green Lantern Corps.  I feel a bit misled.  I like Hal Jordan...and wanted to see more of him, learn more about him as a person, and learn more about him as he learned to use his powers.  Sadly, this movie didn't deliver.  The storyline is pretty basic and is all action-driven, with little thought given to character development.

Disc Two had some interesting special features, like an interview with Geoff Johns, writer; a cartoon of Daffy Duck as the ""Green Loontern"" that was quite humorous; and four episodes of the ""Justice League"" animated series (which are already included in the JL seasons on DVD).

The best part of the movie was Sinestro's dialogue.  Victor Garber's portrayal of Sinestro raised the bar for animated comic-book, movie-villain voice-over actors.  He demonstrated a strong understanding of the Sinestro character.  With the exception of Michael Madsen, the other actors came across as voice-over amateurs.",1256428800,2,556,5.482352941176471

If I had one critical comment to make, it would a very small one....I miss Hal Jordan's WHITE gloves! I always thought the idea of a ""super hero"" with white gloves was fantastic, because it signified that he was fairly untouchable! I realize it must be fun for the producers to change designs around, but that one struck a ""faux pas"" chord with me.

I've been in love with superheroes since I first learned to read (way back in the Bronze Age) and although I understand why regular monthly books are targeted at a late 20's audience, I can't figure out why DC is doing this with thier direct to DVD films. The Batman/ Superman Adventures and the JLU cartoons followed a perfect formula...I could get my geek-on and my kid could fall in love with the same characters I grew up loving. So why add just enough boorish and childish ""Adult"" content that the cartoons only have the narrower appeal? Who needs to hear a hero say ""damnit"" or actually watch Sinestro torture someone? These qualities have ALWAYS been succesfully implied to older audience members without explicitly being portrayed in a manner that will chase most 5 or 6 year olds out of the room.

And the intro was more than perfect. But... after that... things start to not make sense. I am a really huge fan of GL and i have followed it's trail since the Kyle Rayner beginnings and a little before when Hal Jordan lost it and became Parallax. What really bothers me is the fact that there are no limits to the rings, there is no Battery charger for each Corp, there is no ""Will"" driven force for channeling the Ring power, is just a simple rock... what happen with the emotional Spectrum that makes the GL's rings to work? what about the 24 hr recharging limit? Maybe i am really used to the real power that drives this heroes, and mostly with the Blackest night story going on, that i really don't understand why they went like this for the story. My girlfriend didn't bother much of it, and thought the story was really good. But maybe, it was me because of all the knowledge behind the Green Lanterns M.O.

For first comers, it's a nice movie, for big old fans... it might be a disappointment on how the origins was treated. There are a lot of stuff needed to be explained but for just an afternoon flick... i guess this one will suffice.

Maybe it's because I'm a huge fan but I was let down in every aspect of this movie.  Bad voice acting & horrible story are the big two.  I really didn't like any of the voice choices for the characters at all.  None seem to fit.  The story was really subpar.  It was like a bobo mix of all the GL origin stories told... only not as detailed in that story.  The action and mission starts right away.  Now that isn't always a bad thing but in this instance, I didn't care for it.  If you're a giant GL fan then you may be disappointed in this.

This movie centers too much on Sinestro and i felt that the Green Latern was more a background player than the main character.

Green Lantern gets the ring in the first few minutes and before you know it, he's using the ring like he's had it for years. There's no training, no getting used to his new powers so this was not an origin story.

The Green Lantern corp got their butts whooped too many times. You figured with the numbers they have, that they would be tougher.

I didn't like how they used the ring. Lantern made giant golf clubs and hammers mostly. He just banged people around most of the time. They should have utilized the power of the ring better.",1253923200,,811,4.386666666666667

Not only did they make a whole feature about a popular DC character (other than the more commonly known Superman and Batman), namely the first Silver Age Green Lantern Hal Jordan. They also wrote an excellent back story for the arch villain Sinestro, showing a detailed account of his time in the Green Lantern Corps, before he turned renegade. The story is well told. The art is great, and you'll see many other members of the Green Lantern Corps appearing in the story, as well as the Guardians of the Universe. The only limitation, is that the story is largely told in outer space. So the Hal Jordan / Carol Ferris romance (previously only hinted at in ""Justice League: New Frontier"" DVD) gets no development here. Carol is only seen in the opening scene of the movie.
But that said, it's one of the better direct to DVD features. The behind-the-scenes extras are interesting too, especially the character profiles, which are narrated sequences.",1253664000,,971,4.785714285714286

3831699,4,B0021AENJG,"Let me begin this review by confessing my infatuation with the DC Animated Universe.  When Bruce Timm and Paul Dini came on the scene with Batman the Animated Series back in September of 1992, I concluded that animated comic franchises would never be the same.  The team proved me correct on through Superman the Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Justice League and of course most recently, Justice League Unlimited (with pretty solid animated film releases all along the way).  I still enjoy Mask of the Phantasm and Justice League New Frontier the most with Batman Gotham Night and some of the Superman films falling into the second tier (meaning good for any other production group but falling short to the level of excellence the animated series have provided).  All of this rambling leads me to the most recent rash of releases, which includes Green Lantern First Flight.  I had the opportunity to watch First Flight almost directly after Wonder Woman and while WW was solid in many ways and certainly entertaining, GL took the cake as far as I was concerned.

Before we get to the plot summary, I must warn that those looking for back-story on Hal Jordan's life before taking possession of the ring need not apply.  In fact the transformation from mere test pilot to galactic guardian takes place before the opening credits even roll.  In my opinion one of the grittier and certainly darker Hal Jordan origin tales occupies much of the Justice League: The New Frontier story arc and fans with such expectations would probably be wise to start there.

Centering on the first mission of Hal Jordan as a Green Lantern, First Flight could almost be described as being as much a back-story of Sinestro as it could the first human to be inducted into the Green Lantern Corps.

The film was written by veteran DC Comics animation collaborator Alan Burnett, produced by Bruce Timm, and directed by Wonder Woman's Lauren Montgomery.  It should also be noted that this title marks the fifth in the line of DC Universe Original Animated Movies released by Warner Premiere and Warner Bros. Animation.

The plot could best be summarized as a ""cops in space"" affair where Jordan is recruited to join the Green Lantern Corps after the death of Abin Sur. He is placed under the supervision of respected senior officer Sinestro who is charged with the task of investigating Abin's murder. It turns out Abin was killed in the line of duty while doing an undercover investigation of insect-like gangster Kanjar Ro, who managed to locate and steal the only element that even the Green Lanterns fear (the yellow element).

Not to worry, this summary really doesn't give away any of the plot twists and turns but rather sets things up nicely for some intergalactic locales, alien cultures, and the concept that even the most vile of villains often start with good intentions.

Green Lantern: First Flight is available as a standard DVD in both single and double disc editions along with a high definition Blu-ray release.

All of the versions offer an exclusive sneak peek of the highly-anticipated next DC Universe animated film Superman/ Batman Public Enemies as well as featurettes on three other DC animated films (Justice League: The new Frontier, Wonder Woman, and Batman: Gotham Knight). Finally they all include a behind-the-scenes look at Blackest Night, the DC Comics series that ambitiously resurrects the dead with black power rings.

Back to the feature, though- this is very close to a 5-star property in my opinion.  The acting, art direction and just general flow of the prose are truly second to none.  In fact the 75-minute runtime and PG rating allow for some pretty cool action sequences and for the first time in DCAU film history, a story that doesn't feel rushed or compressed to fit into a time slot.  The one subtracted star comes from the fact that unfortunately to make the premise work; the show's writers were forced to severely downgrade the clairvoyance ability and just general vigor of the Guardians.  Sinestro, though beautifully crafted and developed here, is simply a bit too powerful for my tastes.  While I do advocate the fact that any hero is only as good as the villain he fights against, the trouble is that the Lantern Corp. (especially with the Guardians at their back) should really be nearly invincible.  Sinestro nearly single-handedly woops the whole lot of them as if he were swatting flies.  Although I should confess that the action in these segments is pretty darn intense if that means anything to you.

 In all another solid entry from a team who has spoiled us nearly continually for the past two decades.  The film is just rife with the type of action and quality that we've come to expect in a Warner Premiere production.  Some may find the lack of a dedicated back-story a bit disappointing, but the formula as presented here does allow for very little time wasted setting up the story.  It's a roller coaster ride from beginning to end.  Best of all the featurette devoted to Justice League: The New Frontier was interesting enough to spur me into digging out my copy of the film and revisiting it.  As such I came away impressed with how well the two stories compliment each other.",1253404800,2,5223,4.835955056179776

3831701,4,B0021AENJG,"I'm a huge fan of WB's renderings of the DC Universe.  I was really looking forward to watching this movie but then I saw some bad reviews and became hesitant.  When I finally bit the bullet, I was pleasantly surprised.  Green Lantern: First Flight is a very good movie.  As always, the voice actors are very well cast.  Christopher Meloni is great as Hal Jordan and Victor Garber is perfect as Sinestro.  The animation is just plain fun to watch.

The storyline was well written with the exception of a few things that bothered me.  The use of the words ""hell"" and ""ass"" seemed a little awkward.  I don't have a problem with the language it just didn't seem to fit for this movie.  I guess they tried to throw that in for the PG-13 rating but it just seemed odd to me.

A bigger problem I had with the story was that Hal Jordan had absolutely no trouble learning how to use his ring.  In fact, it seemed like he just instinctively knew how to use it.  There was no training sequence or anything.  He just goes from being Hal Jordan: Test Pilot to Hal Jordan: Green Lantern.  Now, I never followed the comic books, so maybe that's how it works, but I recall an episode of Justice League where Green Lantern, John Stewart, has to re-learn how to use his ring and it implied that there is a training program that new recruits have to go through.

Anyway, there's also a bar scene that seems like it's straight out of Star Wars and the Guardians reminded me a little of ""the great and powerful Oz"" combined with the old men hecklers from The Muppets...at least at the beginning when Jordan first meets them.  At any rate, these problems were easily overlooked, on my part, and did not detract from my enjoyment of the film.

On to the special features...On Disc 1, we get a sneak peak at the upcoming&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Batman-Public-Enemies-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0027FG2CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman/Batman: Public Enemies (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, which looks promising.  There are also previews for DC's other animated movies, which I didn't watch because I've already seen them all.  There is also a featurette on a DC Comics event, which I wasn't interested in because I don't follow the comics.  On Disc 2, they go into the Green Lantern comic book series with one of its writers.  I'm guessing long-time fans of the series will probably enjoy that more than the average viewer.

There are profiles on Sinestro and the Guardians by the same DC writer, which was somewhat interesting.  Also included is an episode of the Daffy Duck cartoon, Duck Dodgers ""The Green Loontern"", in which Daffy accidentally receives a Green Lantern Corps ring.  We get two episodes from Justice League Unlimited, ""The Once and Future Thing, parts 1&2"" (part 2 briefly features Green Lantern, Hal Jordan).  I was somewhat disappointed with the special features.  None of it really had to do with the movie, itself.  All of the info I got on the movie was from the preview included on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman-2009-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Digital-Copy/dp/B001LK8SQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman 2009 (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a>.

So this film is particularly entertaining because it tells a story about the ""birth"" of this wonderful superhero.  The storyline was very well done, and there is a wonderful plot twist involving a beautiful girl that I particularly enjoyed - not what you expect in a gung-ho superhero story.  As a dedicated animated film viewer, I also have to say this film was very well designed and presented.  In fact, I was surprised how much like a ""comic book"" the graphics somehow were .. remaining true to the original character art.  It's full of action, of course.  I thought it was very well done.

Nice to know the likes of Michael Madsen are doing voice overs, this was one of the reasons I initially bought the film, again it to me gave it creedence that the film was like the aforementioned new gen cartoons, had I had re-alised then maybe as a Sci-Fi lover that it was in fact more a TV movie I would have waited to purchase it at a reduced rate some time in the future or maybe hired it.

3831707,5,B0021AENJG,"The DCAU does it again in it's exciting and entertaining story of Hal Jordan's origin, ""training"" and success as Green Lantern.

Story:
Nothing is better than a conspiracy story, and the plot was perfect, with the surprise of one of the best of the GLC going along with Sinestro's plan for universal domination.  The history of the Guardian's and Sinestro's power source was excellent.  For fans of GL, the name dropping of characters was superb.  This story would be even better if it would be a prelude to a feature film of the Sinestro Corps War, of course with the same cast doing the voices.  and that leads to...

Casting:
I didn't think that home town star Christopher Meloni (I was also born in Washington, DC)would be a good match, but I've been wrong before-and the bit about him understanding the sector/precinct relationship in his duties(a wink, wink to his work on L & O: SVU) was very cute.

Victor Garber is fantastic as renegade/traitor GL Sinestro; the arrogance of the man makes me draw a biblical reference to his character (One who thought that he could do it better and was cast out, hmmm?)

Tricia Helfer was great as Boodikka and lets hope she will be heard again in another DC feature.

Michael Madsen deserves kudos for his performance as Killiwog.  He had said that he used his own voice as the Corps' DI and it was a perfect match. Please have him appear in another feature.

One thing that I was disappointed in: after all the times that she has appeared in episodes, I hoped that we would hear more from Arisia; that she would have a more active part in the story.  Well, I'll keep waiting.

In a nutshell, the casting was supurb.  Well done and thanks, Andrea Romano!

This movie is definately a keeper! Can't wait for Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, the next DCAU feature. The people at Warner Premier and DC has met and exceeded expectations yet again!",1252627200,,1886,4.63855421686747

3831712,4,B0021AENJG,"Like its other direct-to-video films, Warner Brothers/DC Comics has not skimped on the voiceover talent, assembling some veteran actors that are widely respected for their longstanding careers.  Malachi Throne and William Schallert, who have long been associated with television and film, dating back decades, are on had as two of The Guardians and their easily-recognizable voices add distinction to an action-packed film.

Broadway and film star Victor Garber (""Annie"" and ""Titanic"") is great as Sinestro, delivering his lines with gusto and great strength.  Other outstanding performances are given by Tricia Heller (""Boodikka""), Michael Madson (""Kilowog""), John Larroquette (""Tomar Re""), and Kurtwood Smith (""Kanjar Ro"").

Unfortunately, as far as the title character is concerned, Christopher Meloni - an actor of unlimited range, as proved by his starring roles on both NBC's ""Law & Order: SVU"" and HBO's ""OZ"" - is the weakest casting link, and that is no fault of his. Perhaps, it is the timbre of his voice that just doesn't quite match that of other actors portraying superheroes.  He just sounds a little too ""light.""

As far as the story is concerned, it has some plot holes but, overall, it is still an exciting foray into the Green Lantern myth, even if purists might find it rather ""rushed"" in regards to the character's origin.

The 2 1/2 hours of extras are well worth it, especially the over-the-top-silliness of the Duck Dodgers parody. Viewing it after watching the film makes the film itself more enjoyable.",1252195200,,1527,5.208163265306123

I always think of Hal Jordan/GL as this brash, outgoing, center of attention test pilot. The type of guy that all the girls love and all the guys want to hang out with.  But this GL is boring!!  They seemed to have based GL on the voice actor, Christopher Meloni.  Much like Meloni's character in Law and Order, this Green Lantern is mainly a strong, quiet foil for the more dramatic Sinestro, who with Gerber's great voice, seems to be the main character.  Even secondary characters like Bookika, Kanjar To, Tomar Re and Killoweg...all appear to have more personality, plus more face and voice time than GL.  Based on this characterization I can only give this video three stars. Enjoy the action but you will not be blown away by this version of GL.",1251849600,,1016,4.765714285714286

Green Lantern: First Flight is similar to their previous one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman/dp/B001LK8SQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman</a>, in the fact that it is an origin story.

It's about the Silver Age Green Lantern, who is officially the second GL to appear in DC Comics, although most moderate fans are more familiar with the John Stewart GL from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League/dp/B000CSTK3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League</a>&nbsp;animated series.

Hal Jordan is a test pilot on Earth who gets chosen by a dying alien to become the new bearer of a powerful ring which enables its user to create nearly anything they can imagine. With it, Hal becomes a Green Lantern, one of a special force of space protectors that use their rings to keep order in the galaxy. They are lead by a small race of elders called the Guardians on the planet Oa. Hal comes under the wing of Sinestro(they gave a power ring to a guy with that name?)who is the resident top gun of the Green Lantern Corps, and they begin to search for the intergalactic criminal Kanjar Ro. He is planning on using a special yellow element which is supposed to counteract the Green Lanterns' power. Kanjar Ro is also is secretly in league with Sinestro. But Sinestro turns the tables on him, and goes to get the yellow element from the alien race of the Weaponers. They create a special yellow power ring for Sinestro, along with a giant yellow lantern core. Sinestro then heads back to Oa to seize control from the Guardians and destroy their Green Lantern power core. Fortunately, Hal temporarily fuses himself with the green power core, and defeats Sinestro.

Now, I'm not the biggest GL fan out there, but always thought he was one of the better ""space heroes"". The movie doesn't seem to focus so much on Hal Jordan's rise to being a hero, as it is clearly more about Sinestro's fall from grace. We learn waaaay more about Sinestro and his contempt for the way he thinks the Guardians have let the universe go to Hell. The other Green Lantern Corps members get some decent airtime too, like Kilowog, Kanjar Ro, and Ch'p(What? No G'nort?). The animation in it is probably the best that's been put into an DC Universe title so far, at least for one that was made in America. Once again though, the main problem it has is the same with all DC Universe movies in that its at least 15 minutes short. But the fast-paced action and cosmic adventuring really help to sell it.",1251849600,,2967,5.392241379310345
3831716,2,B0021AENJG,"The Green Lantern series from DC Comics, with its emphasis on the inventive creations of the energy constructs of the hero's power ring and his membership in an interstellar police corps managed by the gnomelike Guardians of the Galaxy, is a natural for film adaptation, first in this animated effort from Warner Brothers and then very soon in a live-action film from the same studio (which owns DC Comics). There's more that can be done (and more cheaply) in an animated format than in a live-action work, but this first effort with the central character (as its title suggests) seems to be working out all kinds of initial bugs in the system. The old origin story from the 1950s of the cocky test pilot Hal Jordan being bequeathed his power ring by a dying alien who had previously patrolled his sector of the galaxy is still here--in brief--, but the screenwriters seem to want to leap right over the background story as much as possible: you have no idea why Abir Sur bestowed his ring to Jordan, or how Jordan figured out what the ring can do, or anything like that. (There's even no explanation of the 24-hr. time limit of the ring, or of the power battery which gives the hero his name and allows him to recharge the ring entirely.) Carol Ferris is running around in the early scenes as Hal's boss at the aircraft company, and there's sone talk of Hal's relations with her, but this too is left underdeveloped as we are swept to the center of the galaxy with Hal to Oa, the Guardians' home planet, and he is both trained and watched by their most trusted member of the Green Lantern Corps, Sinestro, whose name is an unavoidable clue as to where his true allegiances lie. (One would have thought the almost omniscient Guardians might have known better than to trust their security to someone with such a name.)

Everything's kind of a mess here: there's lots of action, but you get little sense of what the rings of the Green Lanterns can do or to what extent they are weakened by their single flaw, the color yellow (which in this film is sometimes effective against the rings and at other times not). There's some mild cursing and even some bloody deaths (for some insane reason the producers decided to work for a PG-13 rating), and the whole thing isn't terribly coherent. But the voice work is quite effective, particularly with Chris Meloni ideally cast as Hal Jordan, Victor Garber as Sinestro, and William Schallert--the father from ""The Patty Duke Show""--as the most important of the Guardians. And if anything it's fun to see what the glowing green energy of the power rings can do in an animated film. But the animation itself isn't terribly pretty or stylish, and the dialogue is quite weak (even for a film based on a comic book). We can only hope for more from the live-action feature.",1251763200,3,2806,4.623246492985972

Very little time is spent setting up Hal Jordan's admission into the Green Lantern Corps and he is quickly thrown into the middle of a battle that will affect the future of the universe (doesn't it always :-) This is a solid comic book style plot that is blessed with a decent script.

The action scenes are big and explosive. One reviewer said that only Michael Bay fans would like it. Well.....I am a Michael Bay fan. I like explosions, chase scenes and lots of good ol fashioned action. Don't get me wrong, im a sucker for a good story.

3831731,4,B0021AENJG,"Green Lantern: First Flight

Not a bad intro to everyone's favorite Emerald Gladiator.

Hal Jordan is in his test simulator flirting with Carol Ferris, talking about some sexy retreat they had some time in the past and she reprimands him as the guys in the background grin.  The ""good old boys"" network, apparently.  Too bad Carol was not further fleshed out.

Hal gets abducted by the Ring as he has been elected to take over for Abin Sur, who we recently saw crash landing in the desert.  After some misadventure, he meets more members of the Green Lantern Corps. and meets the little blue guys on Oa, the Guardians.

As expected, Sinestro, the Lantern who wants to train the human, is a turncoat, who complains about the Guardians and wants to do something about it.  Well, what do you expect with a name like Sinestro?

Hal learns really fast how to run that run, man.  He outthinks and saves others who had years more experience than he.  Not sure if that's a fault or not.  Nothing wrong with seeing that humans are capable and fast learners.

As an aside, in Justice League, New Frontier, they also showed a Hal Jordan first getting his ring and he was much more hesitant and clumsy with the ring's power.  In First Flight, a bit more unreal.

The fact that the Lantern Corps were dependent solely on the main power battery at Oa rather than the comics version's personal batteries did not bother me as it would some purist fan boys (and girls).

The Yellow Cannon was cool, all glowing electric and firing yellow energy everywhere.

Hal's absorbing the green energy from an apparently dead battery was great, but he was not omnipotent and depended on his Corps members to bail him out.

The traitor of a friend in the film was a shocker I did not see coming.

Lauren Montgomery did not turn out a bad animated adventure.  Although uneven in parts (that robot, Sinestro's coloring!) I can't wait for a new one.

Christopher Meloni as the voice of Hal Jordan was excellent.  You really saw him get into the emotion of it all.

The DVD has lots of special features that are also included in my Star Rating of this set.  Interviews with Geoff Johns and Dan Didio regarding the comics set Blackest Night was explained well and gave any DC fan some drool.

Wonder Woman featurette was fun, made by the same director as First Flight.  Highly recommended.

Other fun stuff like the featurette for Batman release.

We need to support DC and Marvel's efforts to put out these direct to DVD films of our favorites.  Write them and tell them that these are appreciated.  The First Flight was a good start, not perfect.  Now let's give me something like a full-blown adventure, OK??

Film: 3.5 Stars, but with cool features, a Four Star Special.

The story (script) was well-done and had adult, grown-up themes.  I only wish the animation were more 3 demensional.

3831733,4,B0021AENJG,"Finally Green Lantern gets the spotlight.  While I don't consider myself a huge fan of the Green Lantern I was rather looking forward to this film.  The story is a liberal take on Hal Jordan's (a human Green Lantern) beginning as an intergalactic defender.  The movie was neither good nor bad and was entertaining to watch.  Here are my thoughts;

Pros

+ Great voice acting with notable actors playing the roles of a few of the Green Lanterns.

+ Some adult oriented themes with minor blood.

+ Nice representation of Green Lanterns from other races across the galaxy (minus the Lantern that was a squirrel...)

+ Interesting back story of the Green Lantern organization.

Cons

- Not exactly true to the mythos which will upset true fans

- Seemingly omniscient immortal leaders of the Lanterns completely oblivious to Sinestro's treachery and villainy (Much like the Jedi are somehow amazingly clueless to the Sith menace, go figure).

- Typical silly Green Lantern ring powers abound that ruin the serious feel of the story for me.  For example giant green fly swatters, golf clubs, fans etc...  At times it felt like George Lucas injected his ""family friendly jar jar binks"" humor into the film so it could appeal to all ages.

A fun film to watch and great to see Green Lantern get some individual treatment.  I just wish it would have been a little more serious and polished in some areas.",1250553600,3,1396,4.75
3831734,4,B0021AENJG,"Thanks alot, write Alan Burnett, for ignoring all the things that made Green Lantern cool over the last five years, and replacing them with a 70 minute slug fest. No character devel, no back story, no explanation of how the ring works and why, just lotsa lotsa 'splosions. Animation is good, but that's about it.

UPDATE: 12-29-2011
Okay, now that i've had to see this film again as well as the Ryan Reynolds version a couple of times, i'm willing to cut this movie a lot more slack. Although this film is still dry and far too serious and dark in tone, it does a good job showing Sinestro turn from good to the infamous supervillain. That is in contrast to the terrible live action film, which, if you didn't know sinestro's back story, you'd be severely confused why he, the greatest of the lanterns, would suddenly betray them. For those who are curious about Green Lantern but were thoroughly turned off by the cruddy live action film, then give this one a shot.",1250467200,,966,4.551724137931035

3831736,4,B0021AENJG,"The creators of ""Superman: Doomsday"", ""Batman: Gotham Knight"" and ""Wonder Woman"" deliver another dose of rousing comic book adventure in the new animated movie ""Green Lantern: First Flight"". Test pilot Hal Jordan (Christopher Meloni) is the newest recruit to the elite intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corp, and assigned under the supervision of veteran Green Lantern Sinestro (Victor Garber). While on his first assignment, Jordan discovers that his mentor is secretly plotting to overthrow the Guardians of the Universe. If you enjoyed the previous DC Universe animated movies, then you'll certainly find ""Green Lantern: First Flight"" very amusing. Due to its short running time, the animated movie breezes quickly though Jordan's origins on Earth and jumps right into the action in outer space. Its storyline is pretty straightforward but well paced. ""Green Lantern"" features some engaging action sequences, great animation and a solid voice cast that also includes Tricia Helfer, Michael Madsen, Kurtwood Smith and John Larroquette.

Warner Bros has certainly put some effort to make these DC animated titles to really standout on Blu-Ray. ""Green Lantern: First Flight"" is presented in a 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is truly impressive. On the other hand, its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track lacks some punch in some of the big action sequences, but overall it's good. Despite the lack of an audio commentary track, the Blu-Ray comes well sorted with 5 comic book featurettes, extended promos of previously released animated movies, the ""Duck Dodgers"" episode ""The Green Loontern"", 5 ""Justice League"" episodes (Hearts and Minds PT 1 & 2, The Return & Once and Future Thing PT 1 & 2) and the 8-minute sneak peek of the upcoming animated movie ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"".

3831737,1,B0021AENJG,"I am a HUGE Green Lantern fan.  I am a HUGE DCAU fan.  I watched this movie, as a long time fan, with two friends who knew almost nothing about Green Lantern and comics in general.  We all thoroughly hated it.  None of us made it to the end of the movie.  It is $30 and 70 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  I'm still trying to figure out what went so horribly, horribly wrong with this  movie.

First, the script by Alan Burnett was awful.  Great, they didn't spend a lot of time on the origin story, but this movie is called ""First Flight"".  You would think it SHOULD be an origin story.  And the origin of Hal Jordan as Green Lantern is a really good one.  Very rich and well-developed and even recently re-envisioned by the amazing Green Lantern comic genius Geoff Johns.  Was any of that here?  No.  Instead they took a great origin story and made it stupid, clumsy, and almost entirely non-sensical.

Instead of becoming Green Lantern and getting indoctrinated into the Green Lantern Corps which has been shown, again and again, to be interesting, Hal Jordan is basically beyond expert with his ring immediately, as tho he was born into it.  They ruined Abin Sur's death story.  While Sinestro's transition from Green Lantern to the evil Sinestro is handled well (Sinestro is the real star of this movie, Hal Jordan is just a flat cardboard backdrop), the creation of the Yellow Battery and how that all plays out is completely ridiculous.

All of the plot/script failures pale in comparison to the clumsy, fumbling direction by Lauren Montgomery.  I'm not sure where they dug her up, but the physical action - which is the bulk of this movie - makes no sense.  Lanterns do stupid, extremely repetitive things with their rings.  When they interact with the real world the objects behave in ways that completely defy all laws of physics (for instance shooting the wing off a descending starship that then lands precariously on the opposite wing, suddenly changes direction 90 degrees,  and then skids away skimming along the top of the ground like a giant rolllerblade).

Bruce Timm, who has been an amazing producer for the DCAU was clearly not present in this production at all.  He must have only provided funding and no oversight whatsoever on this project.  Bruce, this tarnishes your name which was previously held in the highest regard. Watch out, Bruce.  Attaching your name to this kind of garbage will ruin your reputation.

Please don't watch this movie!  If you know Green Lantern it'll ruin it for you.  If you don't know Green Lantern, it'll ruin it for you.  If you have to watch it, whatever you do, don't actually spend money on it.  If you know someone who did (like me), please mock them mercilessly for being such an idiot.",1250121600,6,2754,4.63768115942029
3831738,1,B0021AENJG,"The movie is okay, and even has some really nice moments from a visual stand point. The plot is paper thin, but the action sequences are pretty.

It doesn't make sense to not support the format that dominates how digital content is consumed. The ipod and itunes are by far the most used products when it comes to digital content consumption. They're trying to force those of us that use this feature to buy the movie twice, which is sleazy.

I'd read some reviews where people were complaining about how it doesn't follow the comic book storyline, but wouldn't you rather the storyline be a little different so that it would at least be fresh.

The animations are fantastic and watching good ole Hal Jordan and the rest of the Lanterns use their rings in creative ways is fun to watch.  It makes me wish i had one of those rings, i would definitely use it to create a giant fly swatter just like Jordan does.  I was pleasantly surprised by the violence and blood (Gasp!).  I mean its not over the top gory or anything but it gets the point across.  A few people get holes blasted into them and actually bleed, amazing.  The voice acting was quite good in my opinion.  Overall, i was very pleased with DC's latest animated adventure and it rekindled my love for the Lantern.  Hopefully there will be more in the future.  I did read about an upcoming Green Lantern live action movie in pre-production and i guess Ryan Reynolds was cast for the part, but its so far off, nothing is set in stone.",1249948800,,1310,4.367768595041323
3831740,4,B0021AENJG,"Meaty, action-filled animated feature mostly does a nice job of introducing new viewers to DC's Green Lantern character and pleasing longtime fans with its faithfulness to the origin and its generosity in showing many characters from the original comic book mythos.

To add to the many reviewer comments that ""Green Lantern: First Flight"" mostly jettisons GL's origin in favor of jumping right into his first adventure, I think that's only partly true.  What this movie does is jump past the traditional super-hero origin scenes, like the hero discovering and learning to use his powers, and spends more time on the broader aspects of GL's origin, that is, his learning what it means to be a Green Lantern, who his bosses The Guardians are, what his fellow Lanterns are like, and what their overall mission is.  So there IS plenty of origin material here, but it's the richer part of GL's origin. And it's skillfully woven into the main story- an entertaining, intrigue-laden space adventure that, yes, does get underway very quickly.

Are there things I would have done differently?  Sure. I would have liked to see at least a little more of Hal Jordan's life on earth as a test pilot before he's summoned across the spaceways, as well as a short earth scene or two at the end, to bring everything full circle.  More Earth scenes would have made the alien worlds stand out more, as well as helping us get a better sense of who Hal is and what his life on Earth is like.  But the scarcity of such scenes in this ultimately involving and entertaining movie amounts to a quibble.

Speaking of quibbles, though, I do have one more. The second-disc extras aren't as lavish as past two-disc editions of DC's direct-to-DVD animated features.  Without even looking at the back of the box, I was convinced there would be a long, involved doc about the Green Lantern character and how he's been interpreted and reinvented over the years in the comics.  After all, similar pieces were produced for past Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Justice League DVD movies.  But, alas, no go.  I'm guessing that because Green Lantern was given much attention in the special features of the ""Justice League: New Frontier"" movie, it was decided not to rehash all that info again here.  To be clear, there are some half-decent featurettes on this set, and many of the comic book talents who have worked or are currently working on the character are interviewed, but in the end, it's all a little quick and surfacey. On a more positive note, there are a nice selection of ""Green Lantern"" themed bonus cartoons among the special features, drawn from various ongoing cartoon series produced by Warner Brothers.  They're a lot of fun.

In the end, if you're into this sort of thing- animated adaptations of popular comic book characters- I'd say definitely pick-up this well-crafted movie.  The story's sharp and the traditional animation (don't we all still have a soft spot for that?) is very good, too.  But the less, expensive, single-disc version of this film will probably meet the needs of most fans.",1249948800,,3082,4.828897338403042
3831741,4,B0021AENJG,"As a kid, Superman was always my favorite comic book hero. In about the sixth grade a close friend of mine introduced me to the Green Lantern. Superman was still my favorite, but I found the story of the Green Lantern Hal Jordan to be quite interesting. It wasn't until I got to college, when another good friend introduced me to the GREEN LANTERN: THE ROAD BACK series, that Green Lantern became on equal footing with Superman as my favorite DC hero.

With the rebirth and return of Hal Jordan, Green Lantern has become a crucial part of the DC universe, even more so with the new ""Blackest Night"" event. Interest has picked up so much that after years of waiting a live-action movie has finally been greenlit with Ryan Reynolds starring as Hal Jordan. However, that film won't be released until about 2011 so to wet the appetites of GL fans and start spinning the synergy and building the hype, DC has put together and released GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT, a movie-length animated direct-to-DVD feature.

The origins of Hal Jordan as the Green Lantern are fairly well-known and the makers of this feature compact most of that story within the first four and a half minutes. From there Hal Jordan takes of for Oa to meet with the Guardians to see if he's accepted as a Green Lantern and if so, to begin his training. He's accompanied on the journey by the reigning poster-boy of the Green Lantern Corp, Sinestro, as well as several other members of the Green Lantern Corp. Sinestro vouches for Jordan's character at his initial inquiry and asks for permission to train Jordan personally. His request is granted and Jordan follows Sinestro as they search for the killer of Jordan's predecessor, Abin Sur. While on their mission, Jordan becomes wary of Sinestro's harsh and violent methods of ""peacekeeping"". The situations that occur later lead Jordan to unraveling Sinestro's ultimate goal.

As an action-adventure cartoon, GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT is a great movie. It does a wonderful job of finding the right balance between the necessary exposition to move the story forward and great action sequences. The scope of the movie is intergalactic allowing viewers to gain a glimpse into the massive scope of the universe and the huge trust and responsibility entrusted to the Green Lanterns. The movie also does a good job of characterization; building characters who aren't just clich card-board cutouts. Though this is a story about Hal Jordan, it's also a tale of the Green Lantern Corp.

Despite this, there are some flaws with GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT, mainly with authenticity and violence. This movie is a re-imagining of the story of Hal Jordan's origins. Though it stays true to the character of Jordan, other characters' personalities, motives, and origins have been dramatically changed. For instance, it becomes clear early in the movie that Sinestro isn't exactly what he appears, whereas in the comics Sinestro was actually an excellent Green Lantern, except on his home planet. Another character who has changed drastically is Boodikka who plays a key role in the plot of the story but for all the wrong reasons. The other major flaw of the movie is the violence. Personally, I don't have a problem with how violent the film is. I mean, in the comics, creatures are destroying worlds and killing people off all the time. However, in the comics people are usually resurrected in some form or the other and never really stay dead. Not only that, but it used to be in animated films and shows no one was ever shown actually being killed. Not so in GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT. People are violently stabbed through the chest, shot through the heart, have their necks broken in two, and are sucked into space. For older children and adults that might not be an issue, but for younger children it might be.

Overall, GREEN LANTER: FIRST FLIGHT is a fairly decent animated comic book movie. It is a re-imagining of the origins of Green Lantern and is rather violent for young children, but for older children and adults it's actually a very entertaining piece of entertainment.

Special features on the 2-disc DVD include promotional featurettes for JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER, WONDER WOMAN: THE AMAZON PRINCESS, and BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT. There's also a first look at the upcoming SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES DVD to be released in the fall of 2009; behind the story of Green Lantern featurette with Geoff Johns; character profiles of Sinestro and Guardians of the Universe; ""Behind the Scenes of Blackest Night"" featurette; a Duck Rodgers episode entitled ""The Green Loontern""; and a two-episode story from JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED entitled ""Once and Future Thing.""

Of all the special features, the ones only worth much are the Geoff John's pieces (the history of Green Lantern & ""Blackest Night"") and the Duck Rodgers cartoon. The Duck Rodgers cartoon is almost priceless: it doesn't get any better when you successfully combine the wackiness of Daffy Duck with the seriousness of the mythos of Green Lantern.

3831746,4,B0021AENJG,"In the Marvel universe Daredevil is the Man Without Fear. In DC Comics that label falls to Hal Jordan, who shows no fear and brandishes a will of friggin' iron. I'm not one to be on Hal Jordan's jock but I've been reading comic books long enough to know just how much this guy's been put thru the wringer. Not only did he have to put up with Oliver Queen in all those socially relevant stories, but years ago Hal Jordan went insane and turned to the dark side - but having your city murdered under your nose might do that. Dude became a mega-supervillain called Parallax and wreaked incalculable devastation. Later, Jordan sacrificed himself and eventually took up the mantle of the Spectre, after which he came back from the dead (coming back from the dead being only marginally more challenging than chewing gum IF you're a comic book character). In DC's line of direct-to-video original animated movies, it's only natural that the spotlight first focused on the Big Three. But, after Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, I can see why Green Lantern would receive the next animated feature film treatment. Hal Jordan, whether home on Earth or patrolling the perilous spaceways, happens to be one of DC's all-time big guns.

GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT spits on the slow burn set-up and instead plonks you straight into the thick of things. Within the first four minutes of the film the dying extra-terrestrial Abin Sur crash lands and bestows his power ring onto dashing test pilot Hal Jordan, and Hal then becomes the Green Lantern of Sector 2814. There's barely time to acknowledge Carol Ferris and her Ferris Air company before the new Lantern is whisked away to a hellacious deep space adventure. Cue the non-stop action. Just one of the reasons I dig this movie.

Hal Jordan is transported to the center of the universe, to the planet Oa, home to those immortal blue midgets known as the Guardians of the Universe. The Guardians, creators of the Green Lantern Corps, don't think much of humans. Sinestro, the intrepid Green Lantern of Sector 1417, has to talk fast to convince them to allow him to take Jordan under his wing. So off Sinestro and Jordan go, on a mission to learn the identity of Abin Sur's killer.

But there's an even bigger situation brewing. For a while now the Lanterns had been on the lookout for any sign of the yellow element, the only thing powerful enough to counter the green element, which is the source of the Green Lantern Corps' power rings. I don't think I'm spoilering things when I say that Sinestro isn't as noble as advertised, that dude actually leans closer to finkhood than to heroism. Near immeasurable power has corrupted Sinestro, to the point where he now believes that the end justifies the means and has no qualms at all about torturing prisoners for information. He doesn't think much of the Guardians and disparages them every chance he gets. In his new world order, there is no room for these immortal blue midgets. Sinestro very easily lives up to his rep as Hal Jordan's archnemesis. As a bonus, for those who've been reading up on recent Green Lantern stuff, Sinestro eventually dons his black and yellow outfit from the Sinestro Corps. He looks darkly resplendent in a fashionably despotic kind of way.

I'm so used to Hal Jordan being the experienced pro that it's sort of refreshing to see him being the newbie on the block and getting that rookie treatment. You know you're lowest on the totem pole when even the squirrel Green Lantern disses you. Still, soon enough, Hal Jordan is doing his thing, kicking space alien booty, piercing thru conspiracies, and generally proving his doubters wrong. I don't know that Hal's use of his ring is all that inventive or imaginative, but, man, there is such decisiveness and flourish to the way he puts his ring thru its paces. Surprisingly, my favorite ring manifestation was that giant golf club, although, since I'm old-school, I'm kinda glad there's a sequence in which the classic gigantic green fists come into play.

The pace is poppin', the thrills keep on comin', but not so much with the character development. Hal Jordan is Hal Jordan, brash and resourceful and brimming with bravado, even as a fresh-faced rookie and even when his ring is stripped away from him. But Hal just rolls with the punches. Sinestro is the most interesting person here, although not too many'll be startled with his good-to-evil arc. Several old GL favorites make the cut: Boodikka, Arisia, Ch'p, Tomar Re, and one of my all-time favorite Lanterns, Kilowog. Gratifyingly, Kilowog is given a big role and even gets to mutter ""Poozer!"" a couple of times.

The film takes advantage of its PG-13 rating. I liked the violence, but then again I'm a fairly sick mo-fo. Others might raise an eyebrow to scenes of impalements, necks being snapped, and even of a ring's energy beam lethally punching thru a body. The animation is mostly solid, but is at times shaky, and there's that one bothersome sequence in which Sinestro's normally magenta complexion mysteriously shifts to a more human color.

But, never mind, the animators do the job in conveying on film that epic cinemascope vibe that comes with Green Lantern's intergalactic exploits. GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT doesn't quite achieve&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-The-New-Frontier-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000PFSYO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League - The New Frontier (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>'s level of excellence, but it still places third on my list of favorite DC direct-to-video animated films so far (right after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman-2009-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Digital-Copy/dp/B001LK8SQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman 2009 (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a>). The yellow element battery, created by the creepy Weaponers of Qward, looks impressive and menacing, and Sinestro's supervillain street creds are established when he almost dismissively takes out gangfuls (Corpsfuls?) of Green Lanterns. Again, this is a PG-13 picture, so characters actually die in this one, and sometimes quite horribly. Nothing says ""Oh crippitycrap"" like a shower of defunct power rings ominously klunking on the floor at the Guardians' feet. But, just when things look bleakest, check out who reclaims his power ring (no, it's not G'nort).

The special features are... okay. Disc One has: the widescreen feature presentation; the very promising exclusive sneak peek (7:49 minutes long) at the next DC Universe animated film SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES (based on Jeph Loeb's first story arc from the SUPERMAN/BATMAN comic book and starring the voices of Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, & Clancy Brown); in-depth featurettes on three original DC animated films JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER (10:43 minutes), WONDER WOMAN (10:25 minutes), and BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT (10:08 minutes); and a behind-the-scenes look (8:50 minutes) at Blackest Night, the DC Comics mega-event which resurrects the dead and has them wielding corrupted black power rings.

Disc Two has: Behind the Story with Geoff Johns as he discusses Green Lantern's mythology; the pretty friggin' great DUCK DODGERS episode: ""Green Loontern""; Green Lantern Corps Character Profiles on Sinestro and the Guardians of the Universe; and 2 bonus cartoons from JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED: the very, very awesome two-parter ""The Once and Future Thing,"" in which Batman, Wonder Woman, and the John Stewart Green Lantern pursue Lord Chronos and end up first in the Old West and then 50 years into the future. Hal Jordan shows up for a nano-moment in the second part, which I guess is enough of a tie-in to include the two-parter on this DVD. Not that I'm complaining. Watching GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT has got me all kinds of excited to see the live action film. Bring it, Ryan Reynolds!!",1249603200,26,7935,5.217254901960784
3831747,5,B0021AENJG,"This movie totally blew my mind.  Now it doesn't have the greatest plot in the world, but it has everything fans of Green Lantern would ask for.  This movie is totally written for the hardcore comic book fan with deep history of GL and will also appeal to casual fans.

The movie jumps straight into the plot and doesn't have a dull moment.  I wish they would have showed Hal Jordon do some training, but this is supposed to be a fast paced movie and it is limited by time.

If you know GL history, you will appreciate this more because it throws it all in there.

SPOILERS:

Green Lantern Abin Sur is killed and crash lands on Earth.  He needs to choose a successor and the ring chooses Test Pilot Hal Jordan.

Hal Jordan then is transported to OA, the home planet of the Green Lantern Corps, and the Guardians.  The Guardians were about to make Jordan forfeit his ring until Sinestro intervenes and decides to take Jordan on as his protege.

Sinestro tells Jordan of the man who killed Abin Sur and they both go out to capure him.  We then find out that Sinestro has been plotting behind the Guardians back the entire time, and builds himself a power ring that has no weakness besides it's wearer.  A yellow power ring.  The color is the one imperfection in the GL's ring design.

Sinestro goes postal, kills a ton of GLs on screen, and destroys the Power Core and the ones in space are killed off screen in space.  Their rings float back to OA.

Sinestro almost wins, but Hal Jordan is able to recharge his ring through a small power source from the shattered core.

He fights and defeats Sinestro.

At the end of the movie, we hear the Green Lanterns recite their famous oath.  ""In brightest day, in darkest night, ...........""

That's how fast pace the movie flows.  It goes straight into the action.  There are some cruel deaths and one GL even gets impaled.  There is more to the plot than I mentioned, but I won't go into every detail because you still want to be surprised.",1249516800,,1982,4.411602209944752
3831748,4,B0021AENJG,"I came into this movie with large expectations and it did payoff. The movie is fast, action packed, and fun. I do have to admit the beggining, where he gets the ring, was kinda quick. I think they should have showed him learning how to use the ring, but with only 77 minutes I understand why they skipped that. The reason I gave this film four stars out of 5 is because its lacking in the special features department. I own the other DC UNiverse Original Animated Movie (Superman: Doomsday, JL: New Frontier, Batman: Gotham Knight, and Wonder Woman) and there all packed with making of's and history's of the characters. On this we get a preview of there next movie (Superman/Batman: Public Enemies) and a synopsis of what is happening in the Green Lantern comic right now. So I subtracted a star. Overall this was a very good movie that I think has a lot of sequel material.",1249516800,,875,4.509433962264151
3831749,5,B0021AENJG,"This is how DC movies should be made.  I was happy to see how well Wonder Woman was done, but Green Lantern First Flight knocked it out of the park.  As you know this is the origin story of how the first Green Lantern comes to be and his first mission.

This straight to video DC movie is an example of the increasing quality of movies DC is putting out.",1249516800,,354,4.0285714285714285
3831750,5,B0021AENJG,"I was really looking forward to this feature. Green Lantern is one of those DC Universe characters that get very little attention. The Trinity in DC Comics is Superman,Batman and Wonder Woman. And in most cases the rest of the DCU gets put on the backburner. And also Green Lantern:First Flight is the result of a summer campaign in the DC books called ""Blackest Night"".Which will be an eight month maxi-series. So I am very happy that DC has turned it's attention to other heroes on the roster. With Bruce Wayne(the very much alive Batman)in another time period due to Final Crisis. And with some beloved DC heroes returning from the dead as evil zombies(Blackest Night),we need an uplifting story in GL:First Flight. Again Warner Premiere does a top notch job with this DVD release. The story is a combination of Green Lantern's origin story and the current DC storyline. It's a fusion that brings old and new GL fans on board. Ever since DC had the Crisis On Infinite Earths,every now and then certain characters need to be re-vamped to keep the stories new and fresh and in the modern age. It also helps to attract young and new readers. DC does this the best than any other comic book company. The voice cast for First Flight is superb and fits seamlessly and is believeable. Chris Meloni from Law And Order SVU plays GL which is a perfect match because he plays a cop on TV.And the Green Lantern Corps are the ""intergalactic police force""of the DCU.Victor Garber who played Sidney's dad on ALIAS is Sinestro. Playboy blonde Tricia Helfer who played a Cylon on Battlestar Galactica,voices Buddika. And listen out for Kurtwood Smith(Red from That 70's Show)plays an alien. The funniest one is Michael Madsen who played Bud in Kill Bill plays the pig-like humanoid Kilowog. And both discs are LOADED with extras. Here's the breakdown:
DISC ONE:
1.)Sneak Peek of the next Warner Premiere/DCU release:Superman/Batman Public Enemies(based on the Superman/Batman DC Comic)
2.)Inside look at Blackest Night,The Epic DC Comics Event of 2009
3.)Explore the 3 DCU Animated Movies
DISC TWO:
1.)Behind the Story of Green Lantern with writer Geoff Johns
2.)Duck Dodgers Episode:The Green Loontern(Hilarious!!)
3.)Green Lantern Corps Character Profiles
4.)2-part Episode of Justice League featuring Green Lantern John  Stewart
I mean all the extras are worth it and a feature with killer animation that will blow you mind. Please don't underestimate the whole library of these DVD's. Like I've said before in other reviews if you like this one,get the others. Warner Premiere breaks the stereotype of sucky straight-to-DVD animation. The only reason why they are not in major theatres is because they are not not long enough(90 minutes max).But in that 90 mins,a dull moment never passes. You are constantly engaged and entertained. It's just so fun to watch. The only downside I see is the mild language and violent content. So a PG-13 is appropriate. Hey this is the DC Universe and it's a new day and time for our heroes. They have a edge which has been present since Robin died in Batman:Death In The Family. And this trend will continue and Watchmen is a prime example. And in the DC books over the past 20 years we have seen our heroes go through all kinds of misery,real life and death. Superman's apparent Death,Batman's broken spine,death and return of Barry Allen ""The Flash"",GL Hal Jordan becoming a killing madman. And not one but three DCU ""Crisis events"".The readers and fans are the winners here. DC Comics does something the best that no one else does,they listen to the fans. We can make or break them and they know it. Marvel could learn something from this because right now Marvel is really [...].So pick up the DC Universe DVD library. You gotta have it fanboy!",1249430400,,3773,4.876947040498442
3831751,4,B0021AENJG,"Having seen Justice League: The New Frontier and Wonder Woman (I didn't even watch Superman: Doomsday because I read it was so bad), I can confidently say that Green Lantern is the best feature-length animated movie that the folks at DC have yet released.  The animation is crisp, the voice acting is top-notch, the story is pretty darn good, and the action scenes are superb.  I only have two quibbles.  Plot-wise, Hal Jordan's origin as the Green Lantern is given such minimal screen time that it feels worse to include it at all.  The writers either should have made his origin a flashback or skipped the origin altogether.  If you can get over Hal's instant proficiency with the ring, though, the rest of the plot is woven together well.

My second quibble deals specifically with the 2-disk edition.  Frankly, I didn't find any of the special features on the second disk to be worth the extra money.  Two of the ""special features"" are recycled old episodes of Justice League and, believe it or not, Daffy Duck/Looney Toons.  If you've never seen Justice League: Unlimited, the included episodes will be a treat, but I seriously doubt that anyone buying this movie hasn't seen JL.

In sum, I enjoyed this movie much more than I anticipated.  Green Lantern and Wonder Woman are starting to establish a trend of improved quality after the total disappointment that was JL: The New Frontier.  Here's hoping that Superman/Batman: Public Enemies continues to impress!",1249344000,,1466,4.890688259109312
3831752,5,B0021AENJG,"As a kid in the early '80s, I knew all the major DC characters, but I was only submerged in the worlds of Batman and Superman because of their wild popularity. Since then, the world of comic books and heroes have finally infiltrated the mainstream and it's become much easier to delve deeper into the mythos of your favorite character.

Being able to watch an entire animated film about The Green Lantern is unbelieveable, not to mention the fact that it's on BLU-RAY! The success of the DC animated films is directly attributed to their quality production. Every aspect of the film is nearly perfect including the voice acting, the lush animation, and the packaging.

As with all the DC animated films thus far, the acting talent is carefully chosen. Christopher Meloni IS the Green Lantern. Even though he's one of my favorites, it's going to be difficult to to adjust to Ryan Reynolds after hearing Meloni do such a fantastic job at capturing Hal Jordan's occasionally rebellious and saracastic tones. It was great to hear BSG's Tricia Helfer and That '70s Show Kurtwood Smith, among plenty of other stars. GL: First Flight also includes the voice talent of Michael Madsen (Kilowog), Olivia D'abo, and John Larroquette.

The film combines comic book action and mixes in a little sci-fi, which satisfied the Star Wars geek in me. If you enjoyed the animated films Superman Doomsday, and Wonder Woman, I guarantee you will love this just as much. And as I mentioned, I was only a casual fan of Green Lantern before watching this film, but all it takes is one viewing and you'll consider yourself a fan. This is the best way to indoctrinate yourself into the Green Lantern universe. You'll witness the origin of Sinestro and how the Lantern and power rings function, which I was always a bit fuzzy about.

It's easy to wonder why some of the other DC characters haven't been exploited like this, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time. Green Lantern First Flight will get you primed for the upcoming live action film, so I highly recommend making it part of your collection.

Allow me to use my ring to create a big green thumbs up to DCU and WB!",1249344000,7,2147,4.669312169312169
3831753,5,B0021AENJG,"I'll make this short.
DC, while lagging behind Marvel in the live action films released, is miles ahead in the animated films department, and this Green Lantern outing is the best to date. I appreciated the ""PG-13 approach"" taken to this story, with enjoayble dialogue and humor that would probably sail over the heads of most younger kids and keep the story intersting enough for those of us ""older"" Green Lantern fans.

(Released July 28, 2009 by Warner Home Video)
Another Looong DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

With 1992's BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES, producer Bruce Timm began a roll of excellence in adapting DC Comics' characters and concepts to animation that continues unbroken to this day!

In GREEN LANTERN FIRST FLIGHT, Timm hits all the right notes, concepts, and character bits to create as perfect a Green Lantern film as could be imagined.

Everything is as it SHOULD BE.  Test Pilot Hal Jordan is summoned to the crash site of the dying alien Abin Sur, receives Abin's Power Ring, and is transformed into Green Lantern!  Little of the precious running time is spent on this well-known origin, and the transformation takes place between 3:45 and 4:10 of the film.  THAT'S EFFICIENCY!

The balance of director Lauren Montgomery's film (again, as it SHOULD BE) is spent introducing the Green Lantern Corps, their masters the Guardians of the Universe... and the untidy matter of Sinestro.  BIG kudos to writer Alan Burnett for working it all into little more than 70 minutes.

As a reader and fan of DC Comics since the Silver Age - and all phases since, both good and bad - I can say this film (Pardon) ""RINGS"" TRUE!

As is our custom in these reviews, we'll break it into CONS and PROS.

The CONS:

The Special Features:  (For the ""Two-Disc Special Edition"")

There is NO COMMENTARY TRACK for Green Lantern First Flight.

There are ""Promotional / Making Of"" documentaries for OTHER DC Comics Animated Features - Justice League: The New Frontier, Wonder Woman: The Amazon Princess, Batman: Gotham Knight, and a very welcome ""first look"" at the upcoming ""Superman / Batman: Public Enemies"".

...But there is NO ""Making Of"" or ""Behind the Scenes"" feature on Green Lantern First Flight!  Couple this with the lack of a producers' commentary track, and there is little or no information on the film you've just purchased - though plenty of it on Warner catalogue titles.  In all, there are NINE separate Special Features, and not one of them is actually about Green Lantern First Flight!

Credit Where Credit is Due:  Much of the documentary material focuses on the current writers of the Green Lantern comics, Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi.  And, so it should, as they have restored the Green Lantern mythos from a long run of mediocrity to renewed greatness.

BUT, there is virtually no mention of those who created said mythos in the first place!

Artist Neal Adams makes a cameo along the way, but there is not one word about editor Julius Schwartz, writer John Broome, and artist Gil Kane - who conceived the whole shebang early in the Silver Age of Comics!  The Corps and its specific members, the Guardians, the Central Power Battery, the Yellow Impurity, the Planet Oa, Hal Jordan, and Sinestro - and The Oath.

ALL of it sprang from the minds, words, and pencils of these talented individuals - but you'd never know it by the focus presented here.  Even writer Denny O'Neil, who (along with Adams) revolutionized the Green Lantern concept at the end of the Silver Age, is among the unmentioned.  DC Superhero projects from WHV have usually been good - or at least adequate - on historical perspective of the source material.  But, not here!

The PROS:

The Film Itself:  No more spoilers than I've already given, but... YES!  Simply, YES!

The Cast:  Christopher Meloni as Hal Jordan and (especially) Victor Garber as Sinestro make a great pair of lead cosmic adversaries.  Michael Madsen, Tricia Helfer, and John Larroquette are nicely cast as supporting GLs Kilowog, Boodikka, and Tomar-Re.

And a very special treat for fans of sixties television!  Among the actors voicing The Guardians are old stalwarts William Schallert and Malachi Throne!

The Characters:  Hal Jordan, Carol Ferris, Abin Sur, Kilowog, Boodikka, Tomar-Re, Sinestro, and The Guardians of the Universe.

Green Lanterns in lesser roles: Ch'p, Arisia, Saalak, Arkis Chummuck, and the ""Big Head GL"".  There are surely many more that escaped my enraptured notice.

Other villains include Kanjar-Ro (from 1961's JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA # 3) and the Weaponers of Qward.

No John Stewart, Guy Gardner, or Kyle Rayner, as this is the tale of Hal Jordan becoming Earth's first Green Lantern.  They would all come later.

The Special Features:  (For the ""Two-Disc Special Edition"") Two features on the current Green Lantern comics - one overall and one specifically about the upcoming arc ""Blackest Night"".  Though lacking in historical perspective (see the ""Cons"" section) they ARE very informative for those interested in being brought up to speed.

There are two ""mini-features"" - one on Sinestro and one on the Guardians of the Universe.  Neal Adams gets the ""line-of-the-day"" in the Sinestro piece:  ""We had TRIPLETS.  Here's BOUNTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, and SINESTRO...  Who's gonna be the BAD GUY?  Sinestro's gonna be the BAD GUY - I don't know why...""

Bruce Timm picks a favorite JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED episode that is tangentially related to Green Lantern: ""The Once and Future Thing"" Parts One and Two.  Bruce T. KNOWS how to pick `em!  This tale of Batman, Wonder Woman, and John Stewart Green Lantern vs. a wonderfully browbeaten, disrespected, and resentfully angry version of time-mastering villain KRONOS - takes them from the Old West (with Bat Lash, El Diablo, and Pow-Wow Smith) to the future of Batman Beyond!  (Yes, Bruce Wayne gets to meets Old Bruce Wayne!  Wouldn't you feel cheated if he didn't?)

And the Crowning Glory of the Special Features: ""The Green Loontern"" a 2003 episode of the DUCK DODGERS TV show, where Daffy / Dodgers' DRY CLEANING is accidentally mixed up with Hal Jordan's (Ring included!) and Daffy is summoned to assist the Green Lantern Corps with a Sinestro-spawned galactic crisis!

It took FOUR WRITERS to pull off this crossover masterpiece - Spike Brandt, Tony Cervone, and old WB hands Tom Minton and the great Paul Dini - and they wring every ounce of Daffy-esque humor and admiration for the Green Lantern concept from this script, as perfectly as could be!

If you thought the character list of Green Lantern First Flight was something, check out who they squeezed into this 22-minute marvel:  Duck Dodgers, Eager Young Space Cadet, Dr. I.Q. Hi, Hal Jordan, Sinestro, Katma-Tui, Kilowog, Tomar-Re, John Stewart, Guy Gardner, G'nort, Arisia, ""the Diamond Green Lantern"", Saalak, Ch'p, Boodikka... and (in keeping with casting sixties icons to voice Guardians) John Stephenson - at his most regal and officious - as Ganthet!

Great Line:

DAFFY/DODGERS:  Hey, you know... In person, you REALLY DO look like THE DEVIL!

SINESTRO: (resigned) Yes, I get that a lot!

DUCK DODGERS has yet to be released on DVD, making this a TRUE bonus!  If ever a single Special Feature was worth the price of admission, this is it!

OVERALL:  Green Lantern First Flight Two-Disc Special Edition is a rousing success in both the feature itself, and the extras.  If you are a fan of DC Comics (Now - or Silver Age), the Warner Bros. DC Comics Animated Series - or are just looking for a great introduction to the Green Lantern concept -- Green Lantern First Flight is highly recommended!",1249257600,16,7225,4.956702747710241
3831756,5,B0021AENJG,"For one who last saw the Green Lantern illustrated by Gil Kane in the sixties, I have to say it was a treat.  I didn't buy into the whole mythology thing with the corps.  It was entertaining and for whatever flaws in the history there may be, it was a fantastic movie. This film made me a bit more interested in reading about the character again.  If the story has a point of view to convey successfully and was entertaining, it has achieved it's goal.  The only big flaw I found in the movie was the running time.  Past movies have been an hour and a half to two hours.  For 77 minutes it was too expensive.  The previews and directors commentary did little to make it worth the price.",1249257600,2,686,4.230769230769231
3831757,5,B0021AENJG,"You know, I have to say that I'm glad that DC has decided to stop focusing entirely on Batman/Superman and decided to bring some of the other iconic heroes to the screen. I personally think that Green Lantern has been a title that I've always wanted to see. Most times you see him as a supporting character with very few lines. In this feature, Hal Jordan takes center stage for the first time in a long time. I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed at all with this movie. My only complaint would be that I believe the movie should probably been a half hour longer--so that they could flesh out more of Hal Jordan's life and those who haven't been Green Lantern fans could learn more about the Corps. I thought the choice of voice actors was great and Sinestro truly stood out as a menacing villain. My brother and I watched it with my nephew this weekend--and we couldn't come up with anything truly negative to say about it. They left out details, but nothing that would truly get my hackles up.",1249257600,,1003,4.397849462365591
3831758,2,B0021AENJG,"This movie cannot be an origin story becasue it completly ignores the origins of it's main character; Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan was a daredevil fighter pilot before abin sur left him his ring. In this movie it is never actually stated that he is a pilot.
 You see Hal in a simulator, but for all the audience knows he could be training for his first flight, no pun intended. To wield the ring one must have imagination, and most importantly willpower, which our hero has in spades. In the movie Hal can use his ring well... because he can?
To affect the color yellow with the rings one must be without fear. Hal Jordan is called the man without fear becasue as a child he saw his worst fear come true before his eyes, his father crashed a died in a test flight. This is never touched on in the movie.
Now that I have established why this cannot be an origin story, I will address why this is not a good film. Though it is supposed to be the green lantern "" corp "" you never see more than about twelve lanterns on screen at one time. The source of the lanterns energy is a rock, that is green.... no, there's no more explanation, thats it. A rock, that is green, is the reason that species from all over the universe can fly and fire lasers from jewelry.
This film adresses no backstory, and offers nothing new to the series. What it does offer are a few barely decent fight scenes. If you watch ""ANY"" episode of justice league unlimited that features a green lantern you will find better scenes, fighting or otherwise. As I first stated save your money and buy the book, written by Geoff Johns. Green Lantern: Secret origin. Go buy it. Now. I'm done. Seriously.

P.s. If you like that then you should also pick up the Sinestro Corp War, also written By Geoff Johns. Now I'm done. For real.
Bye.",1249171200,3,1791,4.3273809523809526
3831759,1,B0021AENJG,"Buyer Beware! Rent this movie BEFORE you spend any money on it.  Bad does not begin to describe the total lack of story.  Micheal Bay fans, ok you might like it. 77 Minutes of film 3 minutes of story, ugh.  On the plus side it does have the Green Lantern episode of Duck Dodgers, and that almost makes the disk work while.  Duck Dodgers was far, far superior to First Flight in every way.",1249171200,6,388,4.202702702702703
3831760,1,B0021AENJG,"What is created here is a movie only someone who already knows the Green Lantern's origin story could enjoy. Why? Because the origin is cut down to a couple minutes total. Hal Jordan becomes the Green Lantern before the opening credits start. His whole backstory is so short that you never get a chance to connect to the character. He gets his powers and he is off to adventure without even spending time to learn how his powers actually work. And how do they work? Well, the movie never tells you. Sure, it talks about the green element that powers the rings, but never explains how the powers are controlled through a combination of willpower and imagination, which is a huge part of understanding all the things Hal Jordan can do with his powers. The movie runs about 30 minutes too short and sacrifices a good origin story for something only hyperactive kids might enjoy. Furthermore, the animation also reflects this sloppiness, looking no better than the 90's Spider-Man and X-Men cartoons.",1249084800,11,996,4.796511627906977
3831761,5,B0021AENJG,"I'm a huge DC Comics fan, with special attention going towards Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps.  Hal Jordan brought the Corps into my reading list way back when, but my favorite GL will always be Guy Gardner.  Enough talk about me though.

WOW!  WOW!!  WOW!!!

The voice casting was really good.  I wish we could have heard more Kilowog though.  Michael Madsen didn't really get a chance to show off his vocal chops in First Flight.

I'm sure the JLU cartoon fans are screaming bloody murder that John Stewart wasn't in the film, but I'm overjoyed they decided to start the GL animated franchise off with Hal Jordan instead of anyone else.  If you don't count Alan Scott, then Hal Jordan was the first human chosen as Green Lantern to patrol the universe after all.

After seeing First Flight at least five times already, I can barely wait for the sequel.  Hopefully, we'll get Sean William Scott to voice Guy Gardner in the followup.  I've rambled enough already, so I'll shut up now.",1249084800,,991,4.626436781609195
3831762,3,B0021AENJG,"I really enjoyed the animated version of WONDER WOMAN last summer, but this version of Green Lantern simply did not do very much for me.  It is hard to put my finger precisely on what was so weak about this, but I suppose when you are bored that is a pretty hefty indictment of the entire story as told.  The story is pretty standard Green Lantern origins.  Many of the familiar characters are there (though Carol Ferris puts in only a cameo appearance, while because it is an origins story, the other earth Green Lanterns like John Stewart, Guy Gardner, and Kyle Rayner are left out).

I think the biggest problem with the film -- apart form it not being very interesting -- was how bland Hal Jordan is.  Christopher Meloni is tremendously uninspiring doing the voice for Hal.  In listening to him I kept thinking of other voice over artists who have worked on the DC cartoons.  To site just two, take Carl Lumbley doing the voice for J'onn J'onnz or Nathan Fillion doing the voice for either the Vigilante or Steve Trevor.  Those characters came alive in large part because the actors brought them to life.  But Meloni never manages to make Hal Jordan feel like a real character.  He felt cardboardish throughout; worse, he didn't even feel like a part of the proceedings.  Victor Garber was much better doing the voice for Sinestro, but the character was somewhat hurt by his character being introduced in media res, his frustration with the Guardians being unwilling to enforce interplanetary obedience by instilling fear (yellow being the color of fear, just as the ability to wield the green ring being the ability to resist fear) already causing him to put his own plans into action.

All in all, this was one of my least favorite in the ongoing animated DC series.  It is a pretty weak prelude to the upcoming Green Lantern feature film, which will disappointingly star Ryan Reynolds (a huge number of GL fans were hoping for Nathan Fillion).  With Reynolds also appearing as Deadpool, he will have his feel firmly planted in both the DC and Marvel universes.

3831763,1,B0021AENJG,"I had high hopes for this movie as i'm an avid GL fan. Unfortunately, what the other reviewers are saying is correct. This movie has NO character development, an extremely rushed storyline, more english/slang cursing than one would expect in alien languages and finally, little to no ties to ACTUAL GL history. There's no mention of willpower anywhere, just yellow vs green like some schoolyard fight picking sides, the Guardians are petty and whiny, lacking the cold, calculating personality of the books, the rings don't choose their bearer, the Guardians do and it irks me that the Sinestro Corps uniform is already introduced (yes that was a spoiler but we all knew Hal was fighting him at the end, didn't we?). It also felt like they played the ION-card a little early too (those who've read the books will understand that line). I will say that casting and art were nicely done and i really hope someone, somewhere down the line decides to make a GL movie (live action or animation) that goes anywhere near the actual storyline cuz it'd be awesome....",1249084800,12,1057,4.813186813186813

This DVD combines Hal Jordan's origin with the origin of his greatest opponent Sinestro. There's so much to be introduced here (characters, origin stories, the Green Lantern Corps, the Guardians, the entire mythology.... there's just too much to cram into a 77 minute film. I would almost have preferred to see it done as a mini-series.

If you're a fan of the story, you might be upset by the short cuts. If you're not familar with things, you might feel a bit lost. These elements are all that really keeps me from giving the disc a 5. The voice acting was solid, the animation was engaging.

I always thought that the Jedis were a direct rip off of the Green Lanterns, and this animated movie takes advantage of it's original ""space police force"" story. It also touches upon the Yellow Lanterns and Sinestro, making it a broad, action packed feature with rich characters. I hope DC decides to make Green Lantern into a live action film as Marvel did with Iron Man. If you need your sci-fi fix I highly recommend this DVD. I wish I bought the two disk one actually.

I've taken up the habit of buying movies with digital copies because I've got a lot of room left on my iPod, this is the first time I've run into this problem.  Other movies I buy offer a Mac or Windows version, as was the case with ""The Dark Knight"" (say, wasn't that a WB release too?).  As for the movie, the animation is the best I've seen from any of the DC Direct to DVD movies.  This has the potential to spawn some sequels, and if they keep the quality up I hope they do.

Anyway- let me say that this is a really fun movie that will please the majority of fans. A really nice, tight storyline, fantastic casting plus all the favorite lanterns are seen.

Minor issues of course, around the personality of the Guardians, the depiction of OA, and perhaps the needless potty-mouthing.

But this is hands down the best animated usage of the rings you have seen in any DC property- very imaginative. I really enjoyed it.

3831773,5,B0021AENJG,"It's here, the next installment in the line-up of hits from the DC Animated Universe. Everytime one of these movies is released not only am I eager to see the film. I am also always excited to see the preview for their next project. The Green Lantern seemed to a project that the entire staff was very eager to do most likley because the Green Lantern is one of the DC comic chatacters that has not been given much face time outside of the comic books. The Green Lantern is probably one of the most popular comic characters next to the major DC heavy hitters. Probably because of the creativity of the characters, the complexity of the universe GL is in. Or maybe, just that awesome pledge he says.

'Green Lantern: First Flight' really is the very first Green Lantern movie period and I have to admit as much as I was anticipating to opportunity to see it I was still very much surprised. This film is more than just an origin stroy. In fact it really is the story after the origin. The premise of this film is now that Hal Jorden is The Greeen Lantern what happened after that? The story is more about what it takes to be a Green Lantern. The viewer is taken on a roller coaster of a story as the members of the Green Lantern Corp take care of business. Busting crime throughout the universe and of course beating up the baddies. Yet, while they believe everything is fine, there may just be a baddie among them. The viewer of course will get a kick out this film because while it may be Hal Jordans' first mission he is being trained by his future arch nemesis Sinestro. Hal definitely picked an interesting time to be chosen.

Like the previous projects from Bruce Timm and company, this one is just as gritty and exciting as it's predecessors. This movie is a great origional story for Green Lantern fans. It's got Hal Jordan, Sinestro and the Green Lantern history everything a Green Lantern fan craves in an orginal 'Training Day' like story. The voices for the characters are well matched and the action is great, with a few unexpected plot twists and surprises. Now I think the guys working on the 2011 live action Green Lanter movie should definitely check this one out...it could give them a couple of pointers.",1248912000,,2222,4.48395061728395

3831775,2,B0021AENJG,"I waited with eager anticipation for this DVD.  The idea of Chris Meloni playing Hal Jordan as an intergalactic cop's voice was quite intriguing.

Unfortunately while the music score is great the dialogue and voices are just too hackneyed.  The story is too much focused on action. In Wonder Woman we got an origin where cahracters loved and had motivation, men, women and even Ares loved his son even if he was the villainous jerk side of War.

In this story, we get Sinestro taking in Hal Jordan under his wing and without ruining the rest of the movie... scenes and music were far too similar to Star Wars for my liking. Particularly in a dance club the music was similar to the first/fourth Star Wars film.

I love sci-fi as much as the next nerd, but this might be one best to get used after a few months. The voices fell flat and there was no build up of care or emotion. I could not have cared if one of the GL's died or anything because they were just written as funny looking guys and ladies in costumes rather than having unique but ailien motivations and heroic character. Kilowog is mariginally developed but again the voice is painful.

This was really a C- job. 2 stars is being NICE>",1248912000,2,1198,4.422727272727273
3831776,3,B0021AENJG,"From Warner Brothers animation who gave us ""Wonder Woman"", ""Justice League Frontier"" and `Gotham Knights"", comes DC's next direct to DVD installment ""Green Lantern: First Flight"". Directed by Lauren Montgomery with script written by Alan Burnett, the movie is a 75 minute ride in the beginnings of Hal Jordan as a member of the Green Lantern corps and incorporates several references in the story arc from ""Sinestro Corps""collected in Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps comic monthly comic titles.

While testing out a flight simulator in Ferris aircraft, Hal Jordan (Christopher Meloni) suddenly disappears in a flash of emerald light. Taken to a remote area where an alien spacecraft had crash landed, Hal becomes the recipient of a ring of power, since its previous wielder, Abin Sur was mortally wounded. Hal was chosen by the ring because of certain qualities but before he becomes the ring's true user, he must prove his mettle to the Guardians. Sinestro (Victor Garber) takes Hal under his wing in the hunt for Appa Ali Apsa (William Schallert) who was responsible for Abin Sur's death and who has found the yellow source of power. While in the quest, Hal and the other Lanterns (made up of Kilowog (Michael Madsen) and Boodikka (Tricia Helfer) finally uncover Sinestro's secrets; he intends to destroy the central power battery that provides power to the rings of the corps members.

Think ""Emerald Dawn"" and ""Sinestro Corps"", then you may get a general idea as to what the movie is all about. The direction and screenplay keeps the story moving, with a lot of ring slinging scuffles while touching on the certain character attributes of Hal and Sinestro. I liked the part where Burnett displays the differences as to how Hal uses his ring as opposed to the other members' methods. Hal uses bats, guns, springs to get the job done; one may say that Hal is more creative with the ring's uses as opposed to other members merely generating force blasts and force fields. It was a good attempt at human qualities being brought into exposition when compared to the other alien members. Sadly I find this development very hard to buy into, as we don't see Hal being the recipient of the ring's workings--no definitions of will power and imagination are explored, I found it hard to believe that a rookie green lantern would be more adept with the ring. I guess the filmmakers are relying on fans of the comic series to fill in the gaps.

The movie also has several plot missteps. The Guardians are supposed to be one of the eldest and wisest races in this universe; also they are powerful telepaths--yet they didn't think of using their abilities to probe the dead mind of Appa. (I am thinking that the telepathy of the Guardians is more potent than Xavier's). It was just too convenient for Sinestro to know what to do to find the Weaponers of Qward. Also, I find it unbelievable that the Guardians only had one attack up their sleeve and then they yield to Sinestro. Sinestro, alone with one yellow ring could undo the entire corps? Sure his power battery was sentient, and the rings were vulnerable to yellow but really, these are the corps members who supposed protected the universe? They all felt a little too inexperienced to me and the rules of the green central power battery felt a little too underdeveloped.

Now for the ultimate question: Does ""Green Lantern First Flight"" display good ring-slinging action? Yes, it does. The encounters between Appa's gang of bug-aliens and Hal were very entertaining. The final fight between sinister Sinestro and Hal is reminiscent of their encounters in the comic series, with Hal utilizing the power of the green central power battery (ala ""Emerald Dawn"") to use against him. The fight was well-choreographed with a good exclamation point. It was a great touch to have Hal move two moons against the yellow central battery. The animation is fluid and nicely executed, the style of the art is similar to other Warner bros. animated features; the layouts are also very spiffy and cool.

""Green Lantern First Flight"" is good, it has that child-friendly quality but mature enough (there is some blood and death) to entertain the adults. However, this ""first flight"" doesn't serve up enough character depth, Hal's psychological profile is a key element in its mythos. The movie is a little hollow, and most characters just disappear from the screenplay a little too quickly. I supposed it was Lauren Montgomery's intention to keep the pace moving to avoid too much dialogue, but in the end, the movie felt a little too short and felt a little rushed; it relied to heavily for fans to fill in the gaps. I sure wished that the other familiar faces of the GL universe played a more active part in the movie. Kilowog was underused; Ch'p the squirrel GL provided some humor, and familiar faces Arisa and Tomar also make appearances.

Despite its flaws, I found ""Green Lantern First Flight"" a decent entertaining entry in the DC universe. It does portray ""green rookie"" Hal Jordan as a hero right off the bat and the movie has loads of action to dish out. I like John Stewart, Alan Scott and Kyle Rayner...but Hal is still the best ring-slinger in my book.

Batman once said: ""The most powerful weapon in the universe and all Hal could dream of is a boxing glove and a flashlight?"" Let's hope for a sequel...

3831778,3,B0021AENJG,"Being as huge GL fan, I was going to buy this regardless of quality.  Just the fact that he is making a stand as a central character for the first time outside of the comics is enough to win me over.
I'm not a big fan of DC films animation, or Bruce Timm's designs, but those elements are a big divider amongst animation fans anyway. My criticisms are mostly with the flow and story.

 I am willing to lose some history to see a solid film, but the problem I had with the movie is that the producers don't set any rules for the universe they create.  Certain things should be set straight about the mythos that they are drawing from to begin with and other things just done away with.

There is no 24 hour recharge, unless this film is supposed to take place in 2 days; the Lanterns have the ability to kill, which, in the comics is only a recent development as a result of the Sinestro Corps War; and the ring bearers are chosen individually by the Guardians -- Hal was apparently the first exception for some reason.  There was no urgency in Hal getting the ring, why would Abin Sur break that code?  Especially knowing that humans are not worthy of the ring according to the Guardians.

Other things were less disruptive.  Hal is very one-dimensional, (as other's have said) there is no wonder with the power of the ring since Hal apparently becomes a master of the ring 6 minutes into the film, and the Guardians, apparently, are not very powerful (I won't ruin this for anyone who hasn't seen it).

The story is, thankfully, simple.  If it was much more complex the film would have suffered greatly.
Overall, I liked the movie, but it could have been much better.  If they were able to do with Green Lantern what they did with Wonder Woman, this would have been the best DC film to date.  I think WW blows this film away.",1248825600,7,1826,4.366863905325443

3831780,3,B0021AENJG,"Let me start this by saying I loved the movie for what it is. The picture and sound quality was great, the Blu-Ray edition really came through with superior picture and Sound like it should. The special features are great and I am really excited for DC's next animated movie. But the movie is nothing like the true story of Green Lantern

The only truth to the story is at the very begining where Hal gets the ring. The alien they say killed Abin Sur is not the one who killed him, and sinestor was thrown out of the corps becuase he enslaved his planet and rueld through fear. The yellow power was not initally a weapon becuas eit was wielded buy Guy Gardner, The Green Lantern that took over after Hal and was through out for being insubordinate. The Green Lanters were never able to kill, their rings would not allow Leathal Force till the Sinestro Corps War a little over a year ago.

Also, the reason that the Green Lantern rings were useless against the color Yellow was because of the being knows as Parallax being trapped by the Gaurdiens in the central power Battery. After Parallax was released, the Green Lanters were finally able to over come the yellow impurity. It was also Hal Jordan who destroyed the corps when he was possesed by Parallax, and Kyle Rayner who rebooted the corps with the only remaning ring.

Overall I loved this film and it was very well acted and written. I would give it 5 stars if is wasn't from the detour this movie took away from the Mythos. It is a worthy addition to any collection and another success for DC. I do have higher hopes for their next animated film becuase it will be derived from a graphic novel already available so it shouldn't sku to far from the true story. Buy it and enjoy. It does suck that there are is not a digital copy for iTunes. That would have made it even better.",1248825600,3,1835,4.391176470588236
3831781,5,B0021AENJG,"Bought it the day it came out and was really stoked.  They crammed a lot into an hour and a half but I thought they did a pretty good job.  I'll start with the pros

they had a lot of the green lanterns we know and love (from the time frame of hal jordans rising of course).
the fights were great and had a lot of ass kicking.
PG-13 so it didn't feel like I was watching a kids movie.
story was great for just being 1:17.
KILOWAG!!
kind of gave me an old school vibe with the truimphant music that played every time a lantern was saved or did something epic.

now for the cons, keep in mind i'm pretty observant and picky about things but it doesn't bog down my overall opinion.

I wasn't a huge fan of the animation, it could've been done just a little better.  like the lantern logos on their chests looked like they were just thrown on there. I am glad however that they had sinestro's symbol right. the modern day animation tries to include flashy computer graphics and not so great attention to detail on the art itself.  I mean hal's chin looks like that of jay leno's.

The soundtrack wasn't the epic music we're used to such as with transformers and modern superhero movies (the most epic I've heard was titled ""serenata immortale"" youtube it!).  I didn't like it at first but I forgot how the old school super hero flicks were.  you be the judge.  not really a con but something I had to warm up to.

the voices could've been better.  the guardians didn't have the echoing voices like I've been used to hearing.  they kind of sounded like the old guys from twelve angry men haha.  and I always imagined kilowag to have a more raspy, vicious sounding voice.  They still did well with kilowag though.

Overall, I really liked the movie and would look forward to see more come out getting involved more deeply with the story such as including parallax, guy gardner and kyle raynor.  it's a hope but I guess we'll see what hollywood does with the live action one coming out in 2011.  so, buy the animated movie to hold you over for the next year and some change.",1248825600,,2067,4.322077922077922

I always wondering why the producers of the previous animated DC series never used Hal Jordan, the 1st and greatest to wear the emerald ring. Kyle Rayner and John Stewart, lanterns that came after Jordan in the comics, debuted ahead of him in animation. Excluding DC New Frontier and his few appearances in The Batman, we had to wait for over 10 years for a solid Hal Jordan Green Lantern story. You save the best for last I guess right? GL First Flight is beyond anything any DC fan could ever imagine. Without giving too much away, this animated movie tells Hal's story so well and true to the comic it'll make you go to the comic store and buy more material on the Green Lantern universe. If you're a fan of super heroes at all, this is definitely something to add to your DVD shelf. Animation, design, and musical score is unlike anything you've seen before in DC movies.

3831786,5,B0021AENJG,"(from a more extensive feature, copyright 2009 Michael F. Hopkins)

  There are two major ways to enjoy Hal Jordan's 50 anniversary, and both offer a lot of excitement, adventure, and depth. One, of course, is The Blackest Night, author Geoff Johns' long-planned and long-awaited magnum opus probing the nature of mortality itself, and the part played by Green Lantern and everyone in the DC pantheon in surviving  -let alone surmounting-  the horrific and grim scenario. The second way is watching this eagerly-anticipated, extremely well-done first animated feature showcasing Hal Jordan at solitary centerstage.

  GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT is the latest offering from Warner Animation, and it's a scorcher. Writer Alan Burnett, Director Lauren Montgomery, along with Casting and Voice Director Andrea Romano pay great homage to the varied patterned Green Lantern saga with a charged SF romp of a tale, a baptism of fire which won't be forgotten. Composer Robert J. Kral (Superman Doomsday) delivers a grand score impeccably worthy of the cosmos-tossing Space Opera it accompanies.

  The Lantern Corps, the Guardians and, yes, Sinestro all receive a sterling spotlight in this story of duty, responsibility, and wisdom at odds, often, with its own best intentions. Christopher Meloni and Victor Garber head an exceptional cast which delivers, once again, the dramatic standards that Warner Animation has conceived and has continued to hold high for live-action filmmakers seeking to do this field of storytelling justice.

  Get charged. Light 'em up.
  This one's a ride. Heroic
  Adventure at it very best.

3831787,5,B0021AENJG,"The concept of the superhero Green Lantern, a man with a magic ring powered by a magic lantern, was invented in the Golden Age with Alan Scott as the hero; Scott's version was discontinued along with most of the rest of the Golden Age heroes, and, when DC revived its superhero properties in the 1950s, the Green Lantern got a major facelift.  The new Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, was an intergalactic cop in the service of the immortal Guardians of the Universe, who created the Green Lantern Corps.  A succession of other Earth-based GLs have appeared over the years (Guy Gardner, John Stewart, Kyle Rayner), but Hal has remained the primary one in the comics for most of that span, despite a somewhat lacklustre animated history (Stewart taking the GL role on ""Justice League Unlimited"", for example).  Now, 50 years after his creation, he gets his owned dedicated project.

For the film itself:  This is clearly a product made by people who've known the GL property for a long time, and anticipate an audience that has at least some familiarity; there's basically no attempt to make Hal's discovery of the ring and his journey to Oa some huge eye-opening revelation.  He takes these things pretty much in stride so that the chafing-at-the-bit production staff can get to the cool parts.  I'm fine with that, though I imagine a film version for a much wider audience will spend more time in the earlier parts.

Overall, though, I really enjoyed it; it's probably the best of the current series of DCU animated films.  Not as scattershot in focus and incomplete for fans of the book as ""New Frontier"", lacking the adaptation quibbles I had with ""Wonder Woman"".  Like the previous movies, it's got a great voice cast (I often wonder if it's really worth it to shell out for reasonably well-known actors like Tricia Helfer and Michael Madsen to voice side-characters; whatever else might be said of Marvel's DVD casts, they don't suffer for using dedicated voice actors).  Christopher Meloni delivers a very good Hal (much better than David Boreanaz's in ""New Frontier"").  Victor Garber, as you might expect, pretty much steals the movie as Sinestro (actually, he'd be a good live action Sinestro).  I was a bit uncertain about Madsen as Kilowog at first, but he grew on me.  Also, while comics fans are just waiting for Sinestro to betray Hal, they managed to genuinely surprise me with the secondary villain.  Narratively, my one real complaint is the very unclear climax; after Sinestro drains the battery, Hal starts hammering away at the 'green element' trying to get it to do something.  Then it starts glowing green again and basically turns him into Ion (the embodiment of willpower, in the comics held by characters like Kyle Rayner and Sodom Yat), though none of this is explained.

I'll start by saying that, given Geoff Johns' extended stay on the comics title recently, and the way so many readers describe it as ""definitive"", there's quite a lot of this that goes against Johns' take on the character (Timm and co, of course, having grown up with other comics, though there are things like Sinestro's Sinestro Corps uniform).  The Guardians of the Universe all have names, for example, and distinct personalities (one of my favourite parts was Ganthet and co. sadly looking on as a rain of rings descends on Oa after Sinestro disables the battery, which kills every Lantern currently out in space, engaged in combat, etc.).  The GL rings and Sinestro's eventual Qwardian ring are fueled by green/yellow ""elements"" (big glowing crystals) that power the batteries.

Recommended for fans of Green Lantern, and superheroes in general (though it's a bit bloodier and more profane than your average cartoon, though anyone who's seen ""Wonder Woman"" knows that about this series of films).",1248739200,4,3793,4.915360501567398
3831788,4,B0021AENJG,"Almost more so than Batman, no DC superhero has resonated with me the way that Green Lantern has.  Now, the Hal Jordan incarnation of the character becomes the subject of this newest DC Universe animated flick, with Green Lantern: First Flight.  The story follows test pilot Hal Jordan (voiced by Law & Order: SVU and Oz vet Christopher Meloni), who after encountering the dying alien Abin Sur, is granted the ring-wielding power of the Green Lantern corps.  He naturally has to prove himself to his fellow corps members, and soon enough stumbles upon a plot involving his superior Sinestro (voiced by Victor Garber) that could destroy the Lanterns forever.  Nicely animated and loaded with some surprisingly violent action sequences, Green Lantern: First Flight is a wonderful introduction for newcomers to the Green Lantern mythos.  The script and voicework are solid as well, and also feature vocal contributions from Michael Madsen as Kilowog, as well as Tricia Helfer, John Larroquette, Kurtwood Smith, Larry Drake, and Juliet Landau.  The only major flaw of the film is that, like many of the other recent DC animated films, it's just too short and leaves you wanting it to stay for a while longer.  Still, Green Lantern: First Flight is one of the best animated flicks yet from DC Universe, and is definitely more than worth your time.",1248739200,2,1342,4.99103139013453

I'm giving this release two stars as once again, Warner Bros shafts the Mac community with another Windows-only digital copy.  Doesn't work on iPods / iPhones?  Funny, as those are the highest selling portable music / video players out today.

Get a clue WB.",1248739200,3,290,4.857142857142857
3831790,2,B0021AENJG,"With all the hype that surrounded this film I was very dissapointed in the story line. This might be a spoiler but the biggest problem I had was the fact that the movie was named ""First Flight"" and yet Hal knows how to use his ring as soon as he puts it on. I did not want to see a comic book turned into a animated movie with the script being word for word from it, but some form of linear progression would have been appriciated. The characters are also surprisingly one dimensional and most of that has to do with the fact that much of their backstory is left out. Jordan's military background, Sinestro's rule over his own planet, and even Kilowog being in charge of handling new members. The animation was incredible and the action scenes do deliver, but I would honestly rent this movie before buying it.",1248739200,5,810,4.406666666666666
3831791,3,B0021AENJG,"just gave it a spin, i gotta say its pretty darn good. a few distractions, some of the art seemed rushed, without spoiling things, certain symbols seemed like someone drew them in hastily with a bleedy felt pen. cgi elements don't blend well, sometimes not at all. and for me Hal needed a different voice. ive liked meloni in everything ive seen him in, and he gives a great performance here, but i always heard GLs words clearer and stronger in my nerd brain.
  story: very well written and presented, it is rushed tho, from the time we meet Hal, 'till hes in the corps fighting, i couldve missed on a bathroom break. thats a serious drag, i was hoping for at least a few minutes of 'get to know my new powers', but i guess the ring did really choose the right guy, and we don't need to be bothered with all of that character development.
  I did dig almost everything else beyond these gripes. bottom line, its a great watch. really good story, especially if you know GL, you most likely won't be let down. its so cool to see the galactic side of the GL story in motion. kinda wish a few more earth scenes were in it to give us all a more relate-able character than some guy in a simulator.",1248739200,3,1192,4.2844444444444445
3831792,5,B0021AENJG,"I have been reading comics for 30 years and I know the origin of Green Lantern front and back. It is a credit to this story that I can say they constantly kept me wondering ""What next?"" through the whole thing. Rather than retelling the origin faithfully to the comics, they managed to stay true to the original vision while spicing it up enough to enhance the origin rather than destroy it and start over. We see Hal get the ring, fall under Sinestro's tutelage, and then ultimately have to save the entire GL Corps in the end. That's a lot for 70 minutes!

The action here is definitely more than a kid's show. People are killed here, blood is shown, and it's generally earned its PG-13 rating. The only thing I hated was the unnecessary use of profanity sprinkled throughout. It's not a lot (maybe 5 words or so), but it's still unnecessary in my opinion. It doesn't enhance the story, so why do it?

That being said, if you're an old-time fan of the hero or someone just coming on board, you'll enjoy this exciting show. I'm really looking forward to seeing what DC does next with Superman/Batman: Public Enemies!",1248652800,2,1117,4.524752475247524
3831793,4,B0021AENJG,"Having been less than excited about many of the DC/WB direct to dvd animations, I was blown away by WONDER WOMAN, and was anxiously awaiting the release of GREEN LANTERN FIRST FLIGHT.  I got an early copy and at the point at which I am writing this review have seen it several times.  For those who do not know the Green Lantern comics this is a brilliant introduction, and for those who do know it...well this film has it's own take on certain aspects of the mythos, and though some things have changed it all works quite well.  Having never been a big Green Lantern fan myself, simply a fan of animation, I went in with minimal knowledge.  The pace of the story progression in this animation is faster than most, but there is allot of story to explain, and the speed does not diminish the overall product.  The story line is a complex one, it is one which deals with the origin of the Green Lantern, the corruption of the  primary lantern, and the explanation of the entire Green Lantern Mythos. The action in first flight packs a wollup but some of the subject matter, and imagery can be disturbing and THIS IS NOT AN ANIMATION FOR CHILDREN as it does show severe violence, drug addiction, and there are spattered instances of vulgarity.  With this entry into the direct to DVD animation race, DC/WB have shown that they are capable of taking their properties and giving them a treatment that will appease the fan base and undoubtedly make it larger.  The two disk addition is worth the extra bucks for fans it has two great episodes of Justice League Unlimited, and a really cute WB animation staring Daffy Duck called the Green Lantoon.  This and some great interviews about the upcoming public enemies, and DC comics event Darkest Night round out a really great offering from DC/WB animation.  They have done another good job.",1248652800,2,1832,4.609230769230769
3831794,2,B0021AENJG,"I am by no means a huge Green Lantern officanato (meaning I have read only a handful of GL comics, but I do enjoy GL. I was certainly disappointed with the movie. Not for continuity issues or anything nick picky like that, but simply I felt the story was very rushed and one dimensional. Like one review said it was straight to the action, it had no character development, at all. I would imagine this would be entertaining if I was under the age of 13, but honestly the straight forward ""Jordan has ring, One Lantern is Bad, Lets all fight, Jordan saves the day"" Story was just too bland.

Great art, and great voice acting by far. But the story was simply lacking. Certainly not worth buying (unless its for the kids).",1248566400,4,720,4.413533834586466
