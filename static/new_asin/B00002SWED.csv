1256420,3,B00002SWED,"This movie moved sort of slow and I had to watch it twice to fully understand it, but all in all it had a good ending. It was great to see a movie without sex and bad language. Of course Flanery did an exceptional  job, as always. Murphy was a little weak, but fun.",953164800,2,265,3.9074074074074074

7916337,5,B00002SWED,"I just loved this movie. It reminds me a bit of Harold and Maude. Sean Patrick Flanery is wonderful and adorable as Zack, a man who is so overcome by grief that he carries his wife's skeleton around with him everywhere he goes. Brittney Murphy is the quirky Reba, devastated over her fiance's suicide. Together they learn to survive and go on.",1312934400,,343,4.548387096774194
7916338,3,B00002SWED,"I loved it! ""Zack and Reba"" was your great off-the-wall qwirky movie. Brittany Murphy was so expressive in it with her exasperated looks, throwing fits, and wanting to ""stab"" her mom (Kathy Najimy) with a corn-on-the-cob. The craziness in the cast was perfect. Everyone was true to their character being very over-the-top with their performance. The movie humors at dark situations like  heartbreak, suicide, and death; which reminded me of another movie that made fun of the same things in ""Harold and Maude"". The main plot is Debbie Reynolds trying to help her grandson find love again after his wife died with Brittany Murphy's character after her fiance kills himself. ""Zack and Reba"" was just an over-all fun B movie.",1268006400,,722,5.016666666666667

7916340,2,B00002SWED,So there i was surfing the net... listening to suicide kings in the background.... thinking... okay so i just won the Young Indian Jones trading card set... what ELSE should i get that has sean patrick flannery in it! A HA!  here we go... a movie with BRITNEY MURPHY as well- SCORE! Well... i was sadly sadly... very disturbed that i paid this much money for a movie that sucked this badly.... if you like quirky black comedies... this movie is for you... but not for me! Sean patrick flannery drives around with his wifes skeleton... britney murphy causes her fiance to kill himself because she doesn't want to marry him.... it all just sucked...  sean though... is still of course sexy sexy! and so is brtney murphy- but i think she looks better as a thin blond.. than a baby fat brunette....,1067472000,9,794,4.545454545454546
7916341,3,B00002SWED,"I will be honest with you. I rented this movie for one reason, and one reason only.
I'm addicted to Sean Patrick Flanery.
There, I've said it. Granted, I had high hopes for this film, based on reviews I'd read, and the cast list. Kathy Najimy, Debbie Reynolds, and Michael Jeter have all been in films and/or television shows that I've enjoyed. I'd only seen Brittany Murphy once before and found her quite charming. Like I said, High Hopes...
So, I sat down and started to watch this movie, described to me as a quirky, off-beat comedy... The comedy was way past quirky. It was more the dark, morbid sort.
I've noticed that Sean Patrick Flanery has a knack for doing films about unusual relationships that appear doomed from the beginning, but somehow find a way to work. This one was no exception. The romance between the title characters is improbable at best, but more accurately it's down right ridiculous. Actually, everything about this film was ridiculous...
On the flip side of that coin, it makes no real attempts to take itself seriously, so it's not as hard to maintain your 'willing suspension of disbelief'.
The pluses are:  1. Sean Patrick Flanery, as adorable, hopelessly romantic, and charming as ever 2. Debbie Reynolds... Just cause she's Debbie Reynolds 3. Brittany Murphy's wide-eyed expressions, pouts, and on-camera crying 4. Michael Jeter - he always cracks me up...
The minuses are: 1. Ridiculous plot 2. Over the top antics (burying a character in his football uniform means a casket that's bigger than the hole, and so on) 3. The death of one character that was unnecessary 4. All around lack-luster story
Over all, I'd recommend this one as a no-brainer, or for a fan of any of the actors in the show... They all gave good performances. It's not their fault the plot wound up failing them...",994723200,7,1819,4.7746031746031745
7916342,3,B00002SWED,This is a good movie to see if you're amused by people throwing skeletons into ravines.  It made me laugh at least twice (but only for a short period of time).  If you like movies that are intellectually stimulating then this is not for you.  This modern-day love story is absolutely ridiculous and maybe even offensive to some people.,975628800,,335,4.6440677966101696
7916343,5,B00002SWED,"This was a wonderful offbeat comedy, starring the ever-stunning Sean Patrick Flanery.  A must-see for all of his fans.  A very happy movie which'll make you go *finger lifting upward* ""pwop"".",953769600,,191,5.129032258064516
