7811087,3,6301320352,"I can't stop laughing -- TAS is hilarious!  That said, from what I've seen so far, I can't rate it much above another mediocre cartoon.  Yes, it has Kirk, Spock, Scotty, and the good Dr McCoy too, but instead of the actors' faces we get a bunch of cheap drawings which is so much less satifying than the visual display we had in TOS.

I've just made it through my first episode, so I probably can't say too much about the series in general, but judging from what was supposed to be a sentimental and perhaps heart-rending installment, it seems generally stilted and kiddish.  Yes, I realize that it is a cartoon, but still... I'm disappointed...

The campfest continues!",1172966400,,670,4.5966386554621845
7811088,4,6301320352,"Clearly the idea early on with ""Star Trek: The Animated Series"" was to come up with sequels to beloved episodes from the original series.  It did not air until the fifth week, but the first episode filmed was a sequel to ""The Trouble With Tribbles,"" while the third took us back to the Guardian of Forever from the classic ""City on the Edge of Foreever.""  However, as you will see a couple of other familiar episodes resonate with this one as well.  The important thing is that there were ""new"" episodes of ""Star Trek"" and that virtually everybody from the cast was doing the voices (with James Doohan doing most of the extra voices).  Oh, and in case you were wondering, the fourth episode produced was the first one aired, and that is the second one here on Volume 2:

Episode 2, ""Yesteryear"" (Written by D.C. Fontana, First aired September 15, 1973), begins with Kirk, Spock and a historian named Erikson using the Guardian of Forever to explore the past of the planet Orion.  However, when they return to the present they discover the First Office for the past five years on the ""Enterprise"" has been Thelin, an Andorian, and not Spock.  A search of the ship's computer reveals that in this new timeline Spock died as a child, and his parents broke up as a result.  Spock remembers that during his ""kahs-wan,"" the Vulcan coming of age ritual, his life was saved by Selek, a cousin.  To restore the proper time line, Spock plans to return to the past and pretend to be Selek to save himself.  Of course things are not that simple.  This episode surprised me a bit because I was anticipating some sort of diplomatic crisis having to do with Sarek, when this one is really about the young Spock.  We heard in ""Journey to Babel"" about the pet sehlat, a teddy bear with fangs, that Spock had as a child, and now we get to see it and a pivotal scene in Spock's development.  The credit here goes to Fontana, the might have contrived a strange situation but uses it to explore Spock's character in meaningful ways (Warp 4.5).

Episode 1, ""Beyond the Farthest Star"" (Written by Samuel A. Peeples, First aired September 8, 1973), finds the ""Enterprise"" pulled off course by Questar M-17, an imploded star.  In orbit around it, the ""Enterprise"" encounters another starship inhabited by shapeless aliens who take control (I have lost count of how many times the ""Enterprise"" is taken overy by aliens, but you can see why Starfleet has the countermeasures employed in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"").  This is a rather pedestrian episode given that the alien creature is basically just evil, so there is no need to understand it.  Kirk and Spock come up with a solution to both the problem of the alien and of being trapped orbiting Questar M-17, but despite the neat title (which was also that of a Lin Carter novel as I recall), there is nothing here to justify it being the first episode aired for ""Star Trek: The Animated Series"" (Warp 3.5).",1145059200,,2940,4.590822179732314

7811090,4,6301320352,"Enough has been said of the original Star Trek series from the 1960s, where little needs to be said of it. Same for all the 1980s and '90s versions like The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager, plus the movies from 1979 to 1991, and so on. What's often neglected are the animated series from 1973-74. I was too young to have seen these series when they first came out, but I do remember seeing them as re-runs in the early '80s, and once again in the late '80s/early '90s on Nickelodeon. Vol. 2 features Yesteryear (9/15/73) and Beyond the Farthest Star (12/22/73). The former was about Spock going back in time to save himself as a kid to restore the present, while the latter involves an ancient starship with invisible entities that try to hijack the Enterprise. My biggest complaints of these videotapes are the fact the episodes aren't put in chronological order, and the fact each VHS fits only two episodes (which they could easily cram as much as six). But at least you can enjoy these without the inconvenience of commercial interruption. It's too bad the animated series are often overlooked by Trekkies everywhere, if you're a Star Trek fan, you want to get the Animated Series collection as well.",1073260800,4,1218,4.696261682242991
7811091,5,6301320352,"Nitpickers will find plenty to criticize in the animated series. But I, for one, am glad to finally have them on video. These stories strongly influenced the early Trek novels, and I was reading those novels long before I ever saw the animated episodes (which were no longer on the air when I discovered the books.) Bjo Trimble also included these episodes in her Star Trek Concordance, and Alan Dean Foster novelized them in his ""Star Trek Logs"" series. The result is, that many Classic Trekkers (including myself) still think of these stories and characters as a part of the Trek universe.
 A case in point is ""Yesteryear,"" about Spock's childhood. In the ""Journey to Babel"" episode of Classic Trek, we were briefly told that Spock had a childhood pet called a ""sehlat,"" described as a sort of teddy bear with long fangs. In ""Yesteryear,"" we finally meet Eye-chaya (sp?) the pet sehlat, and see him sacrifice his own life to save young Spock from a vicious lematya, another Vulcan animal that is frequently mentioned in the novels.
Yesteryear"" establishes that Spock's mother's maiden name was ""Grayson,"" and shows us some Vulcan architecture, with abstract sculptures and water fountains. We see, too, how the Vulcan children mercilessly teased Spock for being half human. Vulcans, it turns out, are not born without emotions -- even those full Vulcan children are obviously acting out with emotion! This fact not only plays a part in the novels, it figures in the movies, too, where Spock finally finds a balance between his emotional and logical sides. In short, ""Yesteryear"" has had such a strong influence on how Classic Trekkers view Spock, that it is the only animated episode still considered to be official canon by Paramount. (The rest, like the novels, are now relegated to the realm of apocrypha.)
 ""Beyond the Farthest Star,"" the second episode on this video, was not as good a story in terms of plot, but it did give us another important detail that crops up in the novels: the life-support belts that the crew wears while visiting the derelict alien ship. These belts generate a protective force field around the wearer, enabling him or her to walk in space or in hostile planet atmospheres. The belt concept was not carried over into the movies, where crewmembers wear the more usual type of environmental suits on spacewalks. However, there is a hint of utility belts in the uniforms in Star Trek: The Movie.",976579200,11,2427,4.87409200968523
7811092,3,6301320352,"The first episode of the Star Trek animated series is ""Beyond the Farthest Star"". Here we find the Enterprise stuck in the orbit of the  dead star. An alien comes abord following the enterprise away team that  beams back. It takes over the ship and wants the crew to take it to the  center of the galixy. At the end they trick the alien and get control of  the ship back. While the animation is good and the people and things  realistic, there are many point outs.  Here's the good stuff  that stayed true: McCoy and Spock's Badgering, the feeling in the voices of  the characters; when I close my eyes I can almost forget that it is only  animation, the storyline has a trekke kind of plot, while simplistic at  best, the music sounds good and the details were all right. {like using  manaual overide at the helm}
  Now we go on to the bad stuff  including corny jokes and illogical actions. Here is the most illogical  thing of all: Spock speaks with feeling in his voice. He doesn't sound like  the spock we all know and love. The time-warp is used in this episode {see  ""The Naked Time"" and ""Assignment Eternity""} but it is  unlike anything in the show. In this it is a simple warp maneuver that can  be accomplished very easily.
  In conclusion the second episode  ""Yesteryear"" has the same up's and downs. It uses the guardien of  forever {see: city on the edge of forever} but the planet isn't evan close.  Spock has so much emotion you might mistake him for a human. Despite this  review I recomment that you buy this episode. I personally own all 11  volumes and 22 episodes. THe are all good and are still part of star trek.  You can evan call them the forgotten trek. They are all worth your money.",965174400,3,1709,4.394230769230769
