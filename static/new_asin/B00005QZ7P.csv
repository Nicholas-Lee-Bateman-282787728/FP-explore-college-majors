7951293,3,B00005QZ7P,"The ninth DVD volume of the Robotech series (the third DVD in the Dana Sterling Saga) contains six excellent episodes concerning the attempt to get an upper hand on the Robotech Masters by joining various Earth forces at a long-unused research ffacility on the moon in a last-gasp effort to destroy the aliens and save the planet - including the eyecatches to and from commercial breaks. In the late 1980s, F.H.E. had released a videotape of these same episodes edited together to form one ""movie;"" while that was okay, this presentation by ADV Films is far superior, allowing easy access to any particular episode on may wish to view.
This is one of my favorite anime series. However, I can only rate this DVD as a ""3"" for two reasons. First, concerning the DVD construction, the main menu begins with a brief clip from the series without any actual menu selections immediately available, which can cause confusion for some users. Second, and by far the most significant downfall, this DVD is NOT compatible with the PlayStation2, whereas the first DVD in the series worked flawlessly with the PS2.",1014508800,,1099,4.851063829787234
7951294,5,B00005QZ7P,"Robotech: Counterattack, chronicles the third six episodes (Episodes 49 - 54) in the second story arc (The Robotech Masters) in the classic, ground-breaking, epic Americanized anime series from the 80s, Robotech.
Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s (along with Star Blazers, Voltron, Transor Z,  etc.)  Known for its cutting edge animation, high-tech battle scenes, futuristic weapons (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
Set 15 years after the events in the Macross Saga, the story picks up with a new generation of Robotech defenders (in this case the heavily armored Armies of the Southern Cross) protecting the Earth as a new wave of Alien invaders, the Robotech Masters, descend upon the earth looking to reclaim the missing Protoculture factory (which will help to save their civilization) hidden aboard the now derelict SD-F1.  Though not the most popular of the three Robotech story arcs, the Robotech Masters Saga is the focal point of the entire Robotech series as the key plotlines and threads (the secrets of the mysterious Protoculture) that bind together the three story arcs are revealed in this story arc.
In this particular volume the action and drama begin to pick up as a memoriless Zor joins the Earth's ranks and the Earth's defenders (under the direction of the stubborn and foolish Leonard) continue to fight an uphill battle against the far superior Robotech Masters.
Here's a rundown of the episodes featured on this DVD:
Episode 49 - A New Recruit:  General Emerson assigns a memoriless Zor to Dana's 15th Squadron in hopes that (an infatuated) Dana can help him regain his memories.  Bits and pieces come back in haunting bits for Zor.  Also, Supreme Commander Leonard makes a faithful decision.
Episode 50 - Triumvirate:  Dana and Zor visit the site of the SD-F1 in hopes to jog Zor's memory and find mysterious plants growing inside.  Marie saves the day as the Earth Defense forces launch their biggest (and fruitless) attack against the Masters yet.  Also, introducing, The Ajax Fighters.
Episode 51 - Clone Chamber:  Musica is overcome with human emotion; Marie saves the day again as Leonard unveils his new plans.  Plus, Dana makes a date!
Episode 52 - Love Song:  Reunited, Sean and Marie head off for a date (with disaster); Nova has a secret admirer.  Plus, Leonard has an unpleasant surprise for General Emerson.
Episode 53 - The Hunters:  Louie's special targeting system for his video game draws attention from the Robotech Development department.  Plus, Emerson's fleet goes off into battle.
Episode 54 - Mind Game:  The 15th is assigned to and attacks the Robotech Masters Fortress -- where betrayal awaits.  Bowie copes with his feelings on killing.  Plus, introducing -- the Invid Fighters!
Incidentally, these volumes DO NOT have special DVD features (aside from trailer ads for other anime series coming out on DVD from ADV).  Not to fear though.  If you purchase the boxed set collections, each boxed set collection will come with an ""Extra:  Elements of Robotechnology"" DVD special which will contain all the DVD special features you could want:  interviews, trailers, feature footage, commercial spots, specs, etc... So by all means, get the boxed set if you are planning on buying.
Though this particular arc of the Robotech saga is pointed to by many as the ""low-point"" of the series (and I felt the same way too as a kid), I must say that it's definitely A LOT better than I remember it being. The action still kicks butt even 15 years later.
If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture icon.  It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US.  If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  They're great for a trip down memory lane. You can't lose!
