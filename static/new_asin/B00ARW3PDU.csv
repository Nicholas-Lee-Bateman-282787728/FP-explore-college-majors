8557097,3,B00ARW3PDU,"Despite the NC-17 rating, this version of this movie is still HEAVILY censored - to the extent that large chunks are not only out of focus, but many time the entire screen goes to white and we can only guess what is happening by the soundtrack (and there are naturally no subtitles during the white-outs). The movie itself is actually better than one might expect for this type of movie, with good acting and excellent production values. The extent of the censorship, however, and the heavy handedness of the way it is done, interferes with both the plot and the enjoyment of the movie as a whole. I can only guess what I missed behind the whited out scenes, but I imagine I would have rated an uncensored version 4 stars.  The heavyhanded censorship of this version rates a solid 0 stars.",1452124800,5,789,4.556338028169014
8557098,3,B00ARW3PDU,"This movie is far from formulaic in that it combines several stories of love as obsession, taboo, and rejection.  The startling opening scene sets the sage for a series of relationships with a twist. The characters are reasonably well sketched but may take repeat viewing if you don't read Chinese. (First time through you may find the captioning too fast.) The actors and actresses seem appropriate and the scenery is deeply authentic for a pedestrian set of lives and smacks of real life in a packed city.  There is a good deal of both male and female frontal nudity and blurred sex scenes to keep the rating within NC-17 limits. There is no easy ending to these tales, but they did keep me in my seat and attentive to the stories and the nuances of culture and relationships in the storytelling.  I would recommend it to those who like movies off the beaten path, serious movies of Asian life, and the underbelly of ""love.""  The music is American pop with a karaoke wrinkle and the Blue-Ray version has only one extra, a commentary by Scud and Herman Yau in Chinese. My copy shipped from Hong Kong.",1432339200,3,1101,4.6020408163265305
8557099,5,B00ARW3PDU,"The DVD arrived very promptly and very well-packaged for protection.  I have not watched the movie yet so can't testify to the quality of the product (e.g. whether it skips or not), but if the seller's ethics (prompt delivery and detailed attention to the packaging) is a valid indication, I have no reason to doubt the disk's quality.  I did check the disk and it is in good physical condition with no scratches.  I would certainly buy from Seller again.  Thanks!",1401580800,,464,4.691358024691358
8557100,4,B00ARW3PDU,"Lately I've been pleasantly surprised by chinese movies. This one, from Taiwan, is a kind of kaleidoscope of forms of love, passion and sex, each one more unusual and surprising than the other, mixing humour, romance, poetry, violence and madness. The DVD cover is misleading, it is not an exploitation filme, nor a gay one, even if there is lots of sex, including homossexuality and front nudity. The film flies much above all of that, and its message,  know what?, is the very title of the filme: love actually sucks! I disagree, but I can't take this seriously, nothing in this film is serious, even when a lover cuts the head of the woman he loves and go with it to live on the rocks over the sea. Very enjoyable and very different! Western cinema, with its formulaic movies, has a lot to learn with the free imagination of the East.",1392076800,5,837,4.543046357615894
