7480977,3,B016WYVIWG,I was looking for a video to help my children understand.  It was just okay.  I found a much better version for children from the Torch Lighter series by Voice of the Martyrs.,1478563200,,175,4.2727272727272725

7480981,5,B016WYVIWG,Great...,1477785600,,8,8.0
7480982,5,B016WYVIWG,"It is instructive to have the writings of Martin Luther examined alongside the timeline of his life and times. This way we are given his thinking and influences and his maturation in the faith of God and resulting zeal to teach the unaltered truth to others. This context is important to understanding the split from the Roman Catholic Church and how this profoundly influenced both the sacred and the secular. A revolution that started with the mistranslation of one single word from the Greek testament. One word.

Most excellent. Enjoyed from beginning to end.",1477008000,,563,4.98936170212766
7480983,2,B016WYVIWG,"The people who were interviewed left out all the unsavory things Martin did and was Martin was not at all the faithful Christian they make him out to be. Martin was confused. The interviewees were most likely protestant or just didn't do their homework. The only clear thing is that they do not know or are refusing to know what the Catholic Church is really about. Martin Luther was disillusioned and was sinful, but conveniently removed the passages of the Bible to allow him to keep sinning without any fear of losing his salvation. The worst thing about it all is he misled so many faithful to believe the individual is their own god to decide what is right and wrong. Because of this, there are, to these people, no real truths. The truth is what the individual thinks is true and right. We can't all be wrong or right about everything. You need the Vicars of the very Church Jesus Himself established to be the official and final word on everything. That is the Catholic Church. Catholic means universal, that's everyone. A two-stars rating means I don't like it. I just think it's very sad and unfortunate that Martin Luther has and will continue to lead so many astray. If you want the Truth, listen to Catholic Answers Live app and look up what the Catholic Church is really about. You have my prayers.",1477008000,4,1311,4.582978723404255
7480984,3,B016WYVIWG,"For those who know the story, this is a solid review, although somewhat dull.  For those who are NOT familiar with the story,I'd really suggest watching Part 2 FIRST.",1476403200,,166,4.724137931034483

7480992,5,B016WYVIWG,"I liked that this one was more in-depth and informative than the previous one that I had viewed. Great with the history that was at that time that surrounded him. I would suggest this movie to everyone, yes everyone to know the greatness that Martin Truly deserves. We as humans need to Thank God every day for Martin, he was definately Gods Saving Grace (besides Jesus Christ) for us as Christians/humanity not to be ruled by false guises (which Christians know exactly what/whom I am referring to. Thank God!",1473465600,3,510,4.741573033707865
7480993,5,B016WYVIWG,This is a well done documentary and greatly insightful into the life of Martin Luther.

7481001,5,B016WYVIWG,This is an excellent video/movie on how one man realized what the Bible actually said and had the courage to stand up to the Catholic Church that was just basically making up rules to enslave people through the fear of being condemned to hell.,1468108800,,243,4.545454545454546

7481005,5,B016WYVIWG,"A very well done 90 minute biography of Martin Luther. His willingness to stand on conscience and the authority of the Bible are inspiring, and it includes many fresh reminders of the goodness of the Gospel, the privilege of easy access to the Bible in our own language, and the importance of standing against even powerful forces in defense of our faith.",1465257600,,355,4.741935483870968
7481006,5,B016WYVIWG,This is a lively and intelligent presentation and explanation of Martin Luther and the Reformation.  Lots of information given in a factual (yet unbiased) format.

7481011,3,B016WYVIWG,I find it hard to follow when there are numerous people narrating.  Especially if they all have different accents.,1461715200,,114,5.0
7481012,5,B016WYVIWG,Excellent documentary on the life and times of Martin Luther.  His persistence in making his 95 Theses known to the people of the time and how it sparked a reformation is remarkable.  He wasn't trying to make changes for notoriety but only to fix what he thought needed to be addressed and modified in the Catholic religion.  He naively believed the Pope and all who served under him would be willing to listen to him and possibly incorporate his suggestions.  They of course would have none of that since their power and control would be inhibited.  Very interesting and insightful biography.,1461715200,8,593,4.8316831683168315

8737474,5,B016WYVIWG,"Part I and Part II of 'A Man Named Martin' deserve to be reviewed together because they're basically the same, Part II being a condensed version of Part I. This is a brilliant presentation of Luther's life by noted Lutheran theologists, ministers and researchers, made more attractive by the abundance of illustrations of the period. I recommend these two DVDs to anyone who wishes to learn more about a transcendental period of history and about the man who made it happen. (I will admit that I binged-viewed all episodes of Part I in one long afternoon and evening. That's how fascinating it was.)",1488412800,4,599,4.825242718446602
