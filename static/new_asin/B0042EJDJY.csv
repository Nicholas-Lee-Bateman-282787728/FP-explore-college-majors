4249472,5,B0042EJDJY,"I can't say enough about this film.  I was mesmerized from beginning to end.  To find out so much about the man behind the voice.  I have loved Bill Withers music since I was a kid. Yet, I had no idea about who this man was.  He is someone I would love to hang out with. I love his wit,his humor and most of all his sensitivity.  Make sure to check out the extras on this dvd also.  His conversation with Bill Russell,Jim Brown and Bernie Casey was quite interesting. I wish it was a bit longer.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Still-Bill/dp/B0042EJDJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Still Bill</a>&nbsp;I am proud to have this item in my collection and I will be sure to show it to everyone I can.",1299715200,3,737,5.0
4249473,5,B0042EJDJY,"The film seems to be a loosely connected collection of moments, arranged by loving hands from a great deal of material, archival and original.

The genius of the film is that it works brilliantly this way.  The viewer is left with the task of putting it together to form an impression of the man Bill Withers is.  Very true to life.

The film makers understood how great the subject matter was and knew what they were doing.  The result is utterly natural and effortless.",1299110400,4,471,4.559523809523809
4249474,2,B0042EJDJY,"Having attended the tribute concert that was barelly mentioned in this film, I was so excited to finally see Still Bill. I'm sorry to say, though I am a fan of Withers and was completely knocked out by the tremendous concert, I feel very let down by this film. I thought it was poorly paced and edited. Though we see Withers in past clips and present events like his high school reunion, a reunion with the guys he served with in the Navy and the concert I mentioned, none of these events last more than a minute, all are cut away from awkwardly and fail to inform us about the man. The musicians who performed at the tribute briefly appear making some comment on his work, but it is so random and unclear, it has little effect. A visit to his home town and other later events, which I will let the viewer see, do begin to reveal Withers, but not enough for me. I was disappointed.",1298764800,7,881,4.281437125748503
4249475,5,B0042EJDJY,"I had no clue , like most people , what had become of the remarkable Bill Withers . When reading Roger Ebert's film home page in 2009 or 10 , i vividly remember him writing about this documentary . I made a mental note to see it . Tonight i streamed the film and just found myself really taken with Bill Withers the man , his family , his story , music , friends , stuggles , upbringing and so on . Thanks so much for sharing your life with us Bill . I'm certain i write for many when i write , we've truly missed you and are thrilled to learn what has occured in your life in the last thirty + years . Great artist and human being .

4249476,5,B0042EJDJY,"After viewing this the other day was very impressed with the insight and time line of Bill Withers life. This film draws you in to the inner workings of a man who while seeming to have his guard up does open up on current events and thoughts of his life. One of those films that you crave for an ending that you would like, but that ends up being the film ending that Bill wants and that leaves a future that may offer much more from him.",1297555200,2,438,4.045977011494253

4249478,5,B0042EJDJY,"So here's where the reviews are hiding! (Originally posted on the rental page).

My goodness, what can i say about this phenomenal, artistic, poetic, and just humble & simple man? i always had this fascination with what i call a deep simpleness to him and his music, but this film made my admiration just topple over. He made me laugh my butt off, and cry my butt off too (and i didn't expect to). His experiences and takes on life sound so much like mines (and my father's) that i just kept shaking my head in disbelief.

We praise the men with awards and ribbons, and with language of intense-scholars, and we praise the bad asses for defying a norm. Well how about praising the men and women who's ""mind's eye is so clear"" and resonates with people so well, we remember just who were are? Where an artist doesn't need to provide you an escape of colorful gimmicks, fancy dance steps, but just a voice and the words of the local friend from down the block?

Why is simplicity in art so underrated when it's the essence of who we are???

i don't know about you, but i an dig it. i can dig all of what Bill Withers had to say. i wish he was an uncle of mines. So much to consider from this. Family, friends, love, music, motivation, ridicule, basically life.

BILL WITHERS YOU WERE, ARE, AND WILL ALWAYS BE LOVED!!!",1296518400,9,1315,4.351020408163265
4249479,5,B0042EJDJY,"First, let me say that I love Bill Withers!  So when I stumbled upon this film on Amazon I didn't know what to expect.  After all, I'm pretty up on documentaries since I run a program that funds them, yet I knew nothing of this film.  I thought, ""How can that be?  It's probably not very good.""  But because I'm a huge fan of Mr. Withers, I decided to order the DVD and take a chance.  Well, I could not have been more pleased!  WHAT A TERRIFIC FILM!!! I love this man even more after watching it than I did before, which I didn't think was possible.  But he is such a great human being - so emotionally vulnerable and honest - and so caring about his family and people in general that my admiration for him grew exponentially.  I could only hope to be half as decent as he.  He's also very quick-witted and profoundly intelligent, although his modesty would likely compel him to disagree.  Spending the ninety-minutes with him while watching this film has left me with such warmth for him, his music and his very inspiring view of life.  I have dealt with many of the self-doubt and low self-esteem issues he has and to this day find myself continuing to struggle with some of them, but seeing this film has left me viewing the sky as a little bit bluer and the grass a little greener.  THANK YOU, MR. WITHERS!  YOU ARE A GREAT, GREAT, GREAT MAN!!!!",1296172800,70,1350,4.326693227091633
4249480,5,B0042EJDJY,"""Ain't No Sunshine"", ""Grandma's Hands"", ""Lean On Me"", ""Use Me"", ""Lovely Day"", ""Just The Two Of Us"" -- All songs that resonate with such truth and authenticity by singer/songwriter Bill Withers. But after his 1985 album ""Watching You, Watching Me"", Withers disappeared from the music scene. Few knew what happened and why Withers walked away from such a successful career. The incredible documentary STILL BILL provides insight not only to the artist behind this music, but also what kind of human being Bill Withers is.

Filmmakers Damnani Baker and Alex Vlack spent over three years first trying to contact their intensely private subject and then arranging to shoot & compile footage for the documentary as they slowly gained his trust. The result is an inspiring glimpse into the life of a man dedicated to his family but also still conflicted by his artistic legacy and the creative struggle of what place his new music would have in todays world. The film takes us on a journey back through Withers' brilliant career as well as forward with a visit to his hometown, his high school reunion, recording sessions, tribute concerts and more. The interviews reveal a man of profound wisdom, feeling, humor and integrity. Particularly touching is the relationship between Bill and his daughter Kori, a singer/songwriter in her own right.

I cannot endorse this fantastic documentary enough as it manages to show, regardless of his age, the kind of artist the music industry is sorely in need of today",1295654400,29,1499,5.016064257028113
4249481,5,B0042EJDJY,"We got to preview this film and were SO impressed! Bill Withers and his exemplary music are two things so many people have taken for granted over the years, so it's a pleasure to meet the man and explore his life, ideas and the feedback from his family, personal friends and friends in the music business.

Most people have a particular ""comfort"" food, like macaroni and cheese or pork 'n beans on toast; something so good, but so simple. Bill Withers' work is ""comfort music"" for everyone. And it is as relevant now as when it first debuted, thirty or so years ago! C'mon, Bill, please record some new offerings and we'll listen and love it!

His work with the students that stutter really touched my heart. But it was the relationship with his daughter and his support of her singing career that was such a thrill to see. I keep hoping that she will get that Ain't No Sunshine or Lovely Day hit to follow in his footsteps, but even if she never has a number 1 hit, you can tell he is already so proud of her talent and that his legacy continues on.

The first time I slow danced with my husband was to Just the Two of Us--it is our song. And whenever we take a road trip, planned our play list for the wedding reception, or just take a drive on a sunny day, we always play a Bill Withers CD.

4249532,5,B0042EJDJY,"Poet, composer, philosopher, husband, father, and former stutterer, performer Bill Withers (Ain't No Sunshine and Lean on Me) is profiled in this nicely edited documentary which reinforces our impression that this is an exemplary human being. He won a Grammy in 1981 and was inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame in 2005.

Born in the tiny coal-mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia, Withers had a childhood that shaped him: bullied by cruel classmates, supported by close chums, and cheered by his beloved grandmother (Grandma's Hands), his primary ambition was to GET OUT! To this end, he joined the Navy at age seventeen.

We follow (via snapshots and affectionate reunions) his path in the Navy (""There's a girl behind every tree in Guam!"" ""There's only two trees on the whole island!"") to his job installing toilets in airliners for McDonnell Douglas; he was a barroom singer (but only after a couple of drinks) until he managed to launch Ain't No Sunshine.

From Withers' wry observations about his beginnings in the music business (""You need an intro here."" ""What's an intro?"") and the brutal effects of touring (""They wanted me to wear a gold lam suit!""), it's very clear why he turned his back on performing and turned his focus instead, on things closer to his heart, namely his marriage and his family. Looking at his remarkable rsum I suspect he has made a comfortable living from the rights to his music, as his unforgetable songs have been used in numerous movies and on countless TV shows.

This is an articulate fellow, obviously revered by his peers (Sting even adds his two-cents worth), his life well managed by his own solid values and by a wife with an MBA. His children are successful in their own right and it's clear how much love and respect there is in their lovely home.

No, I haven't told you too much. It's a pleasure to spend some time with this fine, humorous man and you will come away with a big smile, and with an even higher regard for him as a warm, kind man. The screening I attended at NW Film Forum in Seattle concluded with an invitation to tell our friends about the movie, so I'm happy to see it's possible to buy the DVD from Amazon.",1379635200,,2185,4.650259067357513

4249541,4,B0042EJDJY,"A modest documentary about a modest guy who had a modest musical career, which produced a handful of monster songs that are part of virtually everybody's life soundtrack: ""Lean on Me,"" ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" ""Lovely Day."" That's more than a full career right there, and there's still more where those came from.

As for the DVD, the story seems to be: some (unseen or heard) documentarians search for a ""story"" on this modest man, or an angle for the story they want to share. They never find it, which is the best story of all. Turns out that as he turns 70--a healthy 70--Bill Withers is happy, prosperous, kind but no pushover (still appropriately livid over the stupid, insulting suggestions of the ""blaxperts"" in the music business back in the day), wise, deep, appreciated, and contented, but searching for that elusive ""thing"" that keeps us...what, relevant?

There's no concert tour to get ready for; there's no gigantic moment of crisis, or conflict, or one last mountain to climb, or any of that manufactured crap. But the last image movingly encapsulates the whole story, and the film makers have done a marvelous job making a quiet film about a quietly phenomenal guy whose relevance is not measured by the length of his recording career but by the depth of his humanity.",1335052800,2,1281,4.818181818181818

4249544,5,B0042EJDJY,"Bill, a down to earth guy, honest, looking at his world with poets eyes. Wonderful songs and not forgotten melodies. A fine look back in a life that cares about people, friends, and family. It should be required viewing in every school. Bill Withers, ""Still Bill"" put it on your to see list.",1318464000,,291,4.509433962264151
4249545,5,B0042EJDJY,"WOW! I woke up to this movie this morning and what a way to start the day. I had to watch it again right away and my Sister loved it so much she is buying it right now. I speak to motivate kids and I will be sharing some of the analagies Mr. Withers used. I think he speaks to all people at some time in their lives in a very uplifting way. Find the good in people where they are at, whereever that might be. Loved it and wish I could tell him personally!",1317772800,,455,3.8
4249546,5,B0042EJDJY,"As a professional musician and composer, I am always keenly interested in the life stories of others in the same craft. This documentary uses the songs of Bill Withers as a vehcile to paint a picture of the musician of the 1970's and 1980's, and of today (the documentary opens with his family celebrating his 70th birthday). His life story begins in the impoverished coal community of Slab Fork, West Virginia; his struggles with being an asmatic-stutter as a child; his time in the U.S. Air Force; his time working in the aircraft industry in southern Californmia; and, not to mention, his musical career. Throughout the film he interjects life lessons/words of wisdom that only an individual with his experiences can impart. If you want to find out alittle about Dick Clarke's ""American Bandstand"" and ""Soul Train"" music history as well as guidepost wisdom for life from a man who's got his feet on the ground, then ""Still Bill"" is a must see (and hear)!",1316908800,,957,4.806060606060606
4249547,5,B0042EJDJY,"Delightful, short, but insightful documentary about the great 70s and
80s R+B icon Bill Withers, who wrote and sang such great hits as 'Ain't
No Sunshine' and 'Lean on Me'.

It's a portrait of a amazingly strong yet gentle and likable man, who
refused to bend to record company creative demands, even though it
might have cost him fame and money, and who simply walked away from the
music business when it was no longer something he wanted to deal with.

Now at age 70, he dispenses wonderfully wise and witty aphorisms, and
still works on music, but for himself, not the world. He's also open
enough to question whether his lack of ambition is a good or bad thing
- although on evidence he seems about as happy and well adjusted a man
as you could find, loving his family, helping stuttering kids (he
suffered with the same problem through much of his early life), and
enjoying the creative process itself as an end, not a means.

Quiet, simply filmed, this documentary made me feel good about life,
and I immediately ordered a CD of Wither's greatest hits.",1315699200,3,1058,4.587301587301587
4249548,5,B0042EJDJY,"Heartfelt just like the man himself. I would have like a more focused review of his great songbook. Instead the film reveals the man through all of his stages of life, from obscure country raising to fame and stardom to a kind of hidden genius. I don't want to give away to much about the story but let's just say you a going to see a man who is the very meaning of the phrase- Good Soul. Every artist can learn a lot from Bill Withers. Always stay true to your heart and you can touch the masses in ways others don't.",1314144000,2,518,4.088235294117647
4249549,5,B0042EJDJY,"In an ironic way of speaking; living to be old is a blessing, and doing so keeping all of your mental acumen, physical and physiological talents and traits makes the transition effortless. And amazingly, ""Mr. Bill Withers"" is one of those extrodinarily insightful and gifted people, and this film showcases all of this with the smooth, ease and moving dynamics of his many hit songs. ""STILL BILL"" is easy on the senses, allowing us an authorized lengthy visit into his life, complete with the signs of love, affection and nurturing that many of us have saught from our families, and friends---providing the added benefit of surprise---getting to meet and hear his equally talented young daughter, ""Kori"", whose vocal pipes are the feminine compliment to her famous father.

A really nice, well paced, photographed and audio mastered documentary that uniquely entertains and informs without being pretentious...  ---GBJ",1312588800,,918,5.280821917808219
4249550,5,B0042EJDJY,"When you think of a great troubador of centuries ago, one who makes magic wherever he goes, who creates landscapes of the heart and mind, this is Bill Withers. And to learn in this documentary of his roots, his family, his deep emotions - this is a true gift for all of us. Like Bill's music and poetry, the film is pure, profound, artistic and spiritual.",1305763200,,355,4.393939393939394
4249551,5,B0042EJDJY,"I watched this documentary on HBO, and purchased the video for a friend.  It chronicles Bill Wither's life, including clips from appearances on ""American Bandstand"" and others, combined with current life circumstances.

Bill Withers had a job for many years, installing toilets in airplanes.  He saved his money, financing and pursuing his music on the side, and became famous much later in life than most musicians.

When telling the story of meeting his wife of 40 years, he always boasts about her earning an MBA from UCLA.

So many celebrities have stories of drug or alcohol addiction, cheating, and ravaged lives. Bill is a good solid man, who has managed his life wisely, been faithful to his wife, and did not tour when his children were young.

His son is a lawyer, and his daughter, who simply worships her dad, wants to be a singer and musician like him.

He also reveals he suffers from a significant stammer you hear briefly in the film.
He is VERY incisive, and has learned to deal with his speech by considering what he says very carefully.  I've always envied people who don't equivocate, or second guess themselves. It also shows in the lyrics of his songs.

Discussing success, he says, ""You can pursue greatness, but when you get to ""alright"", you better take a good look around, because that's where you might end up.""  Something he has told his kids.  It kind of flies in the face of the ""shoot for the stars"" school of thought, but there is a great amount of pragmatism and healthy realism from his own experience.

I thought it was interesting and inspiring, especially as an example of a role model for young African American males.",1304726400,2,1656,4.711805555555555
4249552,4,B0042EJDJY,"Very enjoyable film that will indeed rekindle your interest in the man and his music.
Its a shame they couldn't touch on his blackballing in the music industry, or his wife, but I assume those were issues that Mr. Withers made off-limits for his own reasons. Something tells me I may have heard this in an NPR interview with the directors a while back.
Would be very nice if there was a deluxe DVD edition of this film with all the extras available--in particular performance footage, and any other new music. My biggest desire after seeing the film--and the highlight scene of him playing piano in the hotel, singing with his daughter--was to hear more of the music he has been keeping to himself for past 20 years. Of course, I'm not alone in this hope that it will one day all come out.",1301961600,5,789,4.486111111111111
4249553,5,B0042EJDJY,"I was aware of Bill Withers and his most popular songs of the past, but did not know what an incredible man, musician he really is!  This documentary follows him from his humble beginnings, working class man, making alittle music here and there, to becoming a noted musician for that time.  As he looks back on his own life, career, I was so inspired by the man he has become.  He has such profound wisdom in his perspective on life, the music business, family. I felt moved by his words, both in his music and words from a man who now 70 yrs old has some wisdom to share with the world. He walked his journey, searched his soul and created words from that journey that became very popular pieces of music, but that is not all that he is.  To watch him in front of the camera sharing his hurts, his joys, his lessons learned was truly a special thing.  As he watches his beautiful daughter, now a musician in her own right, move him to tears, just shows the depth of this man. Incredible man and an inspiration to the world!",1301443200,2,1024,4.284974093264249
4249554,5,B0042EJDJY,"I've often wondered what happened to Bill Withers. It seemed he just dropped off the scene. Now I know why. I don't think he really knows how much he is missed. He has a style all his own that would still be so refreshing on today's music scene. Just like Bill, a lot of his fans are still around and starving for great music. I did notice how incredibly talented his daughter is also. She has such a dynamic voice and I think she would do well pursuing a music career. I could see how proud Bill is of her.

4249555,4,B0042EJDJY,"Whether you know it or not, you have been influenced by Bill Withers.  His unique songwriting and singing helped to define an era in American music history.  Longtime admirers, the filmmakers wanted to find out what Bill has been up to and decided to do something about it.  In this film they take us along for the ride.  And what a ride it is.  It turns out that Bill is not just an interesting musician, but also an interesting man.  One can quibble with the film's choices; for instance another reviewer laments that the various snippets of Withers in Slab Fork, at his Navy reunion, or at his tribute concert are too short and unrevealing, but I disagree.  The majority of the movie is spent at Withers' house in Los Angeles and consists of interviews, discussions and short segments of Bill dispensing generous amounts of wisdom from various locations inside his very comfortable (and I use that adjective in its best sense) home.  These segments reveal him to be a thoughtful, sensitive, wise, warm and generous man and not only help to explain much of his music but also shed genuine philosophical insight.  And can I just say how beautiful his wife and children are?

We live in a world of artificial truths and artificial people. This film reveals him to be exactly what you thought and felt upon hearing his music:  a deeply rooted and dignified tree standing tall and lovingly in the forest.",1300320000,9,1402,4.681632653061224

Although he's been out of the spotlight (by choice) for quite sometime, it was refreshing to see that he is doing well and continues to make music on his own terms. His daughter shows her love for music and hopes one day to carry on in her father's footsteps. If you're a fan, Still Bill is an incredible must see.
