7904852,2,B000006QO1,"This work covered the case of three women on death row.  At first, I thought the work was going to be one-sided, but I think it later tries to allow viewers to come to their own conclusions.  Bill Kurtis repeats that far fewer women who kill get put on death row.  Then of those on death row, many of them get their sentences communted.  He asks, but never answers, why are states so less likely to kill women.

Here's the thing, the work never mentions Aileen Wuournos, so I think this was produced before her crimes in the early 90s or late 80s.  The work covers imprisoned women who go on to say they've become evangelicals and they could preach against violence if they were allowed to live.  I recall an old law professor telling me that line doesn't get women off death row nowadays.

In short, great facts, but they're from 20 years ago!",1343779200,,844,4.4
