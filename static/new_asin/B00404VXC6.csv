8412065,2,B00404VXC6,"Bowling for Columbine, 2003 film

The film starts by showing a North Country bank in Michigan where a depositor can get a free gun. [How much money is needed?] Michael Moore shows his sense of humor in these opening scenes. Can a dog commit a crime in Michigan? Moore is incorrect in claiming Gandhi ""beat the British Empire"", that statement is incomplete. One scene shows a student's interest in chemistry. Some live news scenes follow, but the film doesn't explain them. Recognize them? Then a short history of US political coups and massacres in foreign countries since WW II. Moore associates the terrorist bombing in Kosovo (no military objective) with the shootings at Columbine high school. Next we see Charlton Heston standing up for his right to travel peacefully to an NRA convention. Outside a small group protests the right of the NRA to peacefully assemble! (How un-American!) Moore shows the views of some students. What does this say about their Educational system? Next Moore interviews a singer; is any musician or actor a reliable source of wisdom? Bowling can be educational, according to these scenes. Moore's statistics are biased since it does not compare the rates of violent deaths. That frantic cartoon is not historically accurate, a mistake for any ""documentary"". Killer bees are in fact invading America, along with fire ants.

More scenes follow, they are either biased and racist, or, reflect the reality of an oppressed people. Who was blamed when blacks were scarce as in late 19th century American cities? Some people say crime rate was falling but the corporate media featured crimes in the TV news. Really true? A producer explains the rationale of the ""Cops"" TV show. Does it reinforce prejudice? The film shows a small town in Canada; it has few murders (like a similar small town in America). One good question is why the murder rate is lower in Canada. [But if it is just about the same as in America, why ask?] Small towns in America may have the same unlocked doors of small town Ontario. Creating fear is a well-known method for controlling a subject population.

Moore points out how bad economic conditions are reflected in a high homicide rate, but this is not ""news"" for the corporate media. Basically, it tells how poor people are oppressed by having a long commute. Maybe they need public housing located close to their job? The stunt at the chain store that sold bullets seems unfair, I wonder why that chain later suffered an economic setback? There is a final interview with Charlton Heston. Moore's question about the murder rates seems dishonest (look up these rates for yourself). The rate of violent deaths in Canada is similar to the USA. Given Canada's northern latitude it should be lower. Did Moore drag out the interview to cause Charlton Heston to leave for his next appointment? If so, was this honest? Moore is a skilled showman if he can make this collection of scenes into popular entertainment.

Documentaries lie on the continuum between news and fiction. Anything real, filmed as it happens, is ""news""; except for sports, it is rare on TV. Fiction must appear plausible to be believed by the audience. Documentaries are ""recreations of authenticated facts"" like the nature films on TV. They are created and edited to portray a point of view. Their success depends on the number of consumers who pay, dollars not academic truths. The use of films for propaganda (a point of view) follows the use of newspapers, pamphlets, and books. Some are better than others, and age gracefully. Did Moore create scenes by splicing together separate events? Are speeches taken out of context? Are events portrayed without their background? Its all part of Show [me the money] Business, the art of getting people's money in return for telling a story. Does exploiting the Columbine massacre show poor taste by Michael Moore?

One Big Lie is that America has more gun violence than other countries. That is as true as saying America has more automobile deaths than other countries. America's rate of violent death (suicides and murders) falls behind France, Switzerland, etc., and Japan, but just ahead of Canada. Canada's crime rate was lower before 1977 when they banned handguns; now it approaches American rates. There is no mention of Mexico, Brazil, or Argentina, who have similar colonial and revolutionary pasts. Any research will reveal these facts, which are usually suppressed in the Corporate Media. If America was such a violent hell on earth there wouldn't be 3,000 illegal immigrants each day! They flee ""gun free zones"" like Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala.",1443571200,,4627,4.9728682170542635
