I was very happy the honeymoon was detailed but there were many scenes that could of made it in the editing process to make this a great dvd.  The scenes where Miranda gets sick from the hacenda to her getting better, the developing of the chocolate business, there were a few others that could have made it to the dvd to really make this dvd outstanding were missing.  I'm sure many agree with me that I would have paid more to have the complete telenovela.  After all not many of the telenovelas repeat on Univision.",1226880000,,584,4.471698113207547

I watched this novela when it was on Univisin and loved it; the DVD definitely does it justice, although many of the minor plotlines had to be cut out in order to fit it all onto a manageable set of four two-sided DVDs. Whether you're a fan of Mexican telenovelas in particular or telenovelas in general, this is a beautiful, well-done and well-acted production that actually has decent English subtitles.",1226275200,,553,6.276315789473684
3172523,3,B0017INRHC,This novela is edited but all in all it's ok.  I wish ALL novelas would be sold as they were watched on TV - with no editing!!!,1225756800,,127,3.7037037037037037
3172524,5,B0017INRHC,"I was fortunate to watch this on TV in 2006, and it's a wonderful story. I'm so glad they didn't trim out the best romantic scenes in the DVD set. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. The storyline centers on the two main character's Miranda and Alejandro. Alejandro comes to take revenge on her father, and of course falls in love with Miranda. The story takes you through uncovering a mystery of the past that led Alejandro to take revenge and changes everyone's lives for better and for worse. They did capture a lot of the jaw dropping secret revels that help piece the implications of the past. It did capture the essences of Berta's troubled pasted, but not so much of Cesar demented mind.

Best scenes:
The honeymoon (of course!!)
Berta and Guapo (I know it's a weird story that wasn't quite developed on the DVD)
The deathbed (I won't tell you who, can't spoil it but get out the tissues on this one)
And the end - what heals the wounds of love?

Technical:
The details on Amazon indicated 1 Disc, but it's actually 4 discs. The first three are double sided and the last DVD is a single. They could have made the last DVD a double side and given us a bit more. There were two small repeat scenes (small ones you might not noticed). I think one was on DVD 1 Side 2 and DVD 2 Side 1. There were a couple of choppy spots created during editing process but other than that it plays well and I didn't have any technical issues.

Run times:
The DVD 13 hours 2 minutes. It aired on TV with a run time of 97 hours 30 minutes (without commercials). So the DVD is ~14% of the actual TV runtime, which is actually pretty decent compared to other Telenovelas on DVD.

So what didn't make it to the DVD...
A lot of the Juan/Renata love story struggles
Fabricio/Cesar family story
Juan's family and Juan's conflicts/issues
Cesar and his manipulations of Renata, Lizania (half-sister to Alejandro) and Nuria (granddaughter to Tomasa)
Alejandro and Liliana entanglement
Miranda's rise to success with the chocolate business",1223164800,18,2015,4.558011049723757
3172525,5,B0017INRHC,"I really enjoyed Heridas de Amor. It is very good quality show.  because the actors are beautiful, landscapes and interiors are very colourful, and the story is fascinating. I don't speak Spanish, but I love latin telenovellas, and, luckyly, this show has English subtitles.  The storyline is very dynamic. It does not reflect a real life, but it is not supposed to be real, it is like fairy tale for grown-ups. I recommend it for people who love and understand the latin culture, who have enjoyed latin telenovellas before and understand the rules of this genre.",1223164800,2,563,4.854166666666667

3172530,4,B0017INRHC,"Heridas de amor (Pains of Love - 782 minutes) We open with young, beautiful, rich Miranda in the final stages of planning her elaborate wedding to Fabricio.

Two days before the ceremony he elopes with the bride's older sister Florencia, who has congestive heart problems. Their father, Gonzalo, is a cranky old buzzard with a possibly murderous past.

Enter Alejandro who is a sworn enemy of Gonzalo because of what he did to Alejandro's father 20 years earlier. Now we are in it! An evil jealous aunt, crooked business dealings, arson at the hacienda and more ""who's your daddy?""

The villains are really villainous, the lovers are both wealthy, spoiled, arbitrary and used to having their own way. Their fights are great fun! This one gets into organ transplants and the financial bust on Wall Street, unplanned pregnancies, desperately wanted pregnancies, and one misunderstanding after another!

Lovely time with a hero who is a grown-up for a change! Glad to see it on Amazon....",1367280000,,985,4.987804878048781

3172533,4,B0017INRHC,"Me Gusto Mucho el Dvd de la Telenovela Heridas de Amor, es una Exelente Historia y cuenta con un Gran Elenco.
El Resumen esta bien hecho, reune las Mejores Escenas de la Telenovela.
Al igual que todas las Ediciones faltan muchas partes que uno quisiera volver a ver, pero dentro de todo Esta Bien Resumida, se entiende perfectamente sin perder el hilo de la Historia.
Lo Unico que no me gusto fue que una o dos Escenas se repiten, es un Error de los Editores, se ve que se les paso ese Detalle que no deja de ser Importante.
El Dvd 1 resulta algo denso, aburrido, de ambos lados, no se si porque esta resumido con Escenas Flojas o que, pero a mi me resulto algo pesado.
Por otra parte considero que el Disco 4 lo podrian haber aprovechado para poner algun Material Extra o incluir unas 2 Horas mas de Resumenes ya que el Disco solo esta grabado de un solo lado, el otro lado no tiene nada y es una pena, siendo que los 3 Discos restantes son de doble cara.

The only problem was the discs had no cover on them to tell you which was first , second etc. until you put them in.  The dvd's I received  one had nothing on it.  the second disc first side was totally empty.  So I missed some important story.  I was able to follow it though.  I never saw the original but this was excellent and enjoyed it immensely.. Oh, and it does have english subtitles for those who need them.
