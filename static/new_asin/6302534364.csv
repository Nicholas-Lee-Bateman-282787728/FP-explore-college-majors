503394,5,6302534364,"I absolutely love this ""20 minute"" workout tape for three big reasons. One, I can easily commit 20 minutes in the morning and in the evening to DOING this workout. Two, the movements are so deceptively easy  you wonder how they can make any difference. And three, you see results  FAST FAST FAST. Callen Pickney knows what she's doing although she's a bit  camp and the production looks like amateurs directed. Don't be put off. You  can look like a million dollars with her techniques.",946857600,75,486,4.682352941176471
503461,5,6302534364,"Once you get these exercises memorized, the workouts will be closer to 15 minutes each.  But do the exercises with the tape for a while to get the technique and the proper speed down (which is slow). You get most of the exercises from the original (blue) tape, although some are repeated in both segments. Take notes so you can make a ""cheat sheet"" for when you travel. Please note you really don't need a barre per se--e.g., to do the Pelvic Wave you can hold onto a column or the sides of a doorway.  The Beginning Callanetics video (also highly recommended) shows people using all sorts of furniture when doing the workout.

The AM workout more closely follows the order of the body parts worked in the original book.  The PM workout splits the leg stretching for some reason from where it is in the book--you may want to switch if it's easier for you to remember.  Also, some of the exercises have slightly different names from those in the book, and one in the PM section (stomach exercise, ""Bent Knee Reach"", says ""work up to 100 both sides"" but since both knees are bent at the same time, you're just doing the one set of 100.

The biggest complaint about Callanetics has always been that the entire program (either Callanetics or Super Callanetics) lasts about an hour, depending on whether you're using the tapes, or using the book.  It can be hard to set aside that amount of time in one chunk.  With this tape, there is no excuse not to benefit from this wonderful exercise program, which is NO impact, and NO sweat(ing). Another nice thing about doing the AM/PM Callanetics is that you can more quickly improve your flexibility, since you're doing some stretching twice a day, instead of just twice a week (if doing the long program as originally recommended).

However, until the DVD is available in a chaptered version, you may as well buy the tape for a lot less money.",1200268800,9,1884,4.566765578635015

 very boring - little or no challenge February 20, 2001
It's probably just me - perhaps I should have NOT purchased this tape. I was looking for a video that would really help me ""jump-start"" my day. I found this to be really boring, the movements quite basic and Callen's personality very cloying. This might be a wonderful relaxation tape, but I do not see the effect I was hoping for.
I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THIS POST BARELY MADE A DENT IN THE 4.5 STARS THIS VIDEO GOT REVIEWS FOR.
ALL OF CALLAN PINCKNEY'S VIDEOS ARE AMAZING AND YOU GET IMMEDIATE RESULTS. ALL OTHER WORKOUT VIDEOS CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET CANNOT COMPARE!
MY ADVICE TO ""BARBPL"": TRY IT AGAIN, OR TRY ONE OF HER OTHER VIDEOS. YOU WERE NOT FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE ""T"" IF YOU FELT OR SAW NO RESULTS. UNLESS YOU PREFER TO JUMP AROUND ALOT AND HAVE FAST MUSIC (BUT GET NO RESULTS)THAN THIS WASN'T FOR YOU.",1088467200,12,1070,4.459183673469388
503463,4,6302534364,"I recently tried Callanetics for the first time via the original 60-minute program.  I loved the short, targeted, effective movements, but because it was difficult for me to find time to do the entire workout, I decided to give the AM/PM tape a try.  The two 20-minute workouts on this tape include a majority of the exercises from the original video (some have been left out).  Although the workouts are designed to be used in the morning (energizing) and in the evening (relaxing), the inclusion of moves in either the AM or PM routine seemed arbitrary to me.  In addition, I found the 20 minute format to be a bit TOO short for my liking; just when I was starting to feel like I was getting a good workout, it was over.  For some people, however, this time period might be ideal, and this video does offer a good introduction to the Callanetics method.  As always, Callan is a gentle, supportive, and encouraging instructor who constantly reassures her students that they can go at their own pace.  Callanetics is a great alternative exercise style to incorporate into your fitness routine, and if you are pressed for time, this video offers an ideal solution.",1068595200,29,1163,4.699507389162561
503464,5,6302534364,"This is 2 complete 20 minute workouts, and it's the gentlest of the available Callanetics videos. It makes an excellent introduction to this unique method, and good for people with not much time to spare. Another added benefit (and this is especially true of the PM section), is that it's wonderfully soothing, and if you're feeling anxious or stressed, Callan's soft and gentle voice, guiding you through these slow motions, will help release any tension, and calm the nerves. If you're the type that needs a lot of ""bounce and flash"" to get you motivated, Callanetics is not for you...this is indeed ""meditation in motion""...the exercises can be very difficult if done correctly, but everything is done quietly and in ""triple slow motion"".
A note to anyone who like me, has weak or problem knees: You may have to modify your movements in the ""Pelvic Weave"" and ""Front Thigh Stretch"" in the AM workout, and in the ""Pelvic Rotation"", ""Pelvic Scoop"", and again the ""Front Thigh Stretch"" in the PM portion. Go at your own pace, and you'll find your knees getting stronger quite rapidly. I was amazed to find that I could kneel and sit on my heels after only 3 weeks...it has been decades since my knees had the agility to do this.
Strength and flexibility are the 2 major benefits I've received so far in the few weeks I've been doing these exercises, and why I would recommend Callanetics to anyone over 40. These are the 2 things we start to lose with age that make us ""old"", and contribute to accidents and ill health. I've also noticed some body shape changes, but it's the feeling of well being that I value more than anything...and the ability to stretch like I haven't been able to do in years.
Callan says of this tape that you'll feel energized with the AM, and relaxed with the PM, and have ""a great body 24 hours a day"". Thank you Callan, for inventing a system that I look forward to doing on a daily basis, and that is making a profound difference in my life.",1026345600,171,1970,4.567796610169491
503465,5,6302534364,"I am a swimmer and do Tae-Bo regularly. I LOVE AM/PM Callanetics! The program leaves me feeling so strong and stretched, and my back (always a bad point for me) feels relaxed and free.
Some of the reviews below and for other Callanetics tapes say that the exercises are too easy. I felt this way for a long time too, but have since realized that it was because my back was doing the work instead of my legs. Once I got stronger and got my legs working, the exercises are both difficult and immensely effective. If you want to be strong and sleek, this is what you need!",993513600,35,569,4.277777777777778
503466,4,6302534364,"I have just started, but having a previous five year experience with ""early bird"" gym classes, I expect it to work very well on all the important organs: back, stomach, thys and legs. One small remark: It would have been better without the dependence on the bar-furniture. Calan says that any furniture can be used, but it is not as easy to find the perfect one, with the right height as well as the sturdiness for some of the excersizes. Still, the bottom line is that Calanetics is the right way for women of ALL ages (I am 36) that want to strengthen their body with a healthy and short daily excersize.",983059200,9,606,4.419642857142857

503468,5,6302534364,My daughters gave me the beginning callanetics video for mother's day.  A friend and I began doing the exercises 3 times a week.  We have lost inches.  Our clothes fit better.  We feel better.  It is so easy as you go at your own pace.  It is easy on your back.  It is relaxing.  It is good for any age and increases your flexibility which helps with weight loss as you are able to burn more calories when you are more flexible.  We began using the next video after one year and have been able to meet the challenges of it as well.  It is the best exercise program I have found.  Thanks Callen,973641600,17,593,4.114035087719298
503469,5,6302534364,"For those of us with short attention spans, this video is superb! 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes in the evening. This video helped to tone and shape me on my way to losing 80 pounds! It's a relaxing video.  It's refreshing because you're not throwing yourself around on the floor,  jumping around or trying to keep up with the routine.  (I also purchased  ""Beginning Callenetics"" to see a more detailed instruction on  proper form.) Callen is a mature,soft-spoken, classy lady who treats her  students with respect.

I can't wait to start Super Callanetics!

I am excited to have finally found what I have been looking for all these years!

Only down side is that it is missing cardio and I need to start supplementing with cardio.",1357430400,2,444,4.378048780487805
7830352,5,6302534364,"This is a wonderful alternative to the original 60 minute callanetics, especially if you pressed for time. It lives up to its claims, it works fast, feels great on your body, it's almost addicting actually. I also run so exercising in the am and pm everyday is not an option, so I break my routine into four or six days. Mon. is am Tues. pm, Wedn. off Thurs. am and Fri. pm. If it's 6 days I include Sat. and Sun. Even with this routine I noticed the results in two weeks (160 min. of callanetics)particularly legs behind and stomach. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Your fitness level and stretching ability are virtually irrelevant.",1327276800,5,641,4.5344827586206895
7830353,5,6302534364,"Even though I adore Callanetics and have done it on and off for the last 10 years, I never seemed to be able to stick to it long enough for those promissed results to show. I just can't stick to a routine which takes an hour at a time, as the original program does - I just can't stay focused that long!
So here's where the Am/Pm program comes in! In my opinion, it's the best off all the Callanetics programs - and I have them all!! It is the only program  that I have EVER been able to stick to.
I can easily motivate myself to do these short programs twice a day, 3-5 times a week. They only last 20 minutes and time just flyes by!
I do the Am program first thing in the morning, and start my day of feeling great! The Pm program I do shortly before bedtime, because it leaves me so relaxed, I could fall asleep right there on the floor!
But best of all: it really does deliever those results promissed.
My posture has improved, my tummy is flatter, my hips are narrower, my legs leaner, I'm more flexible and I am not nearly as tence in my back, shoulders and neck as I usually would be.
Another great thing about the program is, that all the exercises are show with different modifications, so the program will challenge you whether your'e a beginner or experienced exerciser.",1225152000,30,1281,4.25
