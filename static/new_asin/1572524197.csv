7797585,5,1572524197,"Les Sept pchs capitaux is a humoristic French film composed of seven different segments of fifteen minutes each - one for each of the seven deadly sins, which are 1 La Colre, 2 L'Envie, 3 La Paresse, 4 La Luxure, 5 L'Orgueil, 6 La Gourmandise, and 7 L'Avarice. Each film, directed by a different director affiliated with the Nouvelle Vague,  focuses on a different deadly sin, although the way each handles its assigned sin varies wildly. Some of them explore the sin as a modern fable with a moral, while others use them simply as punchlines.

Episode or portmanteau movies were a craze in the 1960's, notably in Italy and France, and very few actually came through the way they were planned: Episodes regularly ran too long (and got cut or deleted), topics too varied, quality was highly uneven, schedules were not kept - in short, a company lawyers' fiest! Seven deadly sins, with a higher than average number of sketches, seemed, with the enthusiasm of youth, to avoid most of the traps and came out as planned - that alone gives it five points! Godard and Chabrol produce the funniest sketches.

In the 'sloth' segment I saw the most beautiful body on earth.  I was a twenty year old college student when I viewed this movie at the Times Fine Art theater in Milwaukee in 1962.
Her name, I believe, is Danielle Aubry.  I have made love to women with gorgeous... but Danielle is still #1 even after all these (40) years.
There are also some socially redeeming qualities about this film but I forgot what they were.
