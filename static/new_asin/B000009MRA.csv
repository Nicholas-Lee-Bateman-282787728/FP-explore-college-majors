7905531,2,B000009MRA,"Ao is the frumpy girlfriend of successful playboy Alex, who takes her for granted. Ao doesn't mind, believing Alex will EVENTUALLY marry her. When Alex's wild cousin Woo arrives with his two mischievous children, their relationship becomes strained. Tension mounts further, when Ao suspects that Alex has fallen for a beautiful director Joe (I think the subtitle engineer should've dropped the `e' in Joe's first name, since this is a masculine spelling). Will Ao and Alex remain together or will Alex decide Joe is the better woman for him? Honestly by the end of the movie, I didn't care who dated Alex!
I felt Heart into Hearts was rather average, mostly because Alex was very unattractive and I felt he used Ao.  In my opinion, Ao could do much better. The humorous scenes were ""so-so"" funny, and the sub-titles were rather poorly done. If you want excellent Chinese romantic comedy I'd recommend looking elsewhere.  Heart into Hearts was just not that great..
Recommended: No. User hero, doormat heroine... I've seen better....",1057881600,,1032,5.029239766081871
