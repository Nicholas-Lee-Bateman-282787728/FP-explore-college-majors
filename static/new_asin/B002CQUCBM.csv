8364349,1,B002CQUCBM,"Be very careful! I ordered what was promised to be the early Alfred Hitchcock silent film. The package arrived with the DVD packaging showing what looked like a 1920s movie poster for ""The Ring"", opened the DVD case to find the DVD with the same artwork, popped it into the DVD player... and there's the early 1950s Mexican boxing film -- not what I ordered. Had a heck of a time trying to get the Amazon.com phone agent for whom American English is not his native language to understand... but eventually did. Was assured I could return the DVD for full refund, and he said he'd send a return label for free shipping. Got the label next day, but when I tried to arrange for what had been promised as free package return by calling UPS, I was told there would be a $9.99 pick-up charge; it's only free if you take it to UPS. So... overall, not very happy with Amazon or UPS right now. Bad service, bad service... and I don't have my Hitchcock film. Three strikes.",1330560000,,963,4.385474860335195

Director: Alfred Hitchcock
Distributor: Wardour Films Ltd.
Release Date: October 1, 1927

The Ring is a silent film about a love story shaped around boxing. `One Round' Jack Sander is in love with a woman named Mabel and the two of them decide to get married. Jack is a very skilled boxer but one day he loses a fight to a man named Bob Corby at which point Mabel also starts to fall for Bob. As Jack learns more and more about Mabel's affair he attempts to work his way back up to the top in a boxing tournament. And in the end he believes that the fight with Bob will determine Mabel's love. So it's actually a pretty decent story about love which surprisingly works very well with the boxing aspect of the film.

The acting is very good here with Carl Brisson doing an excellent job as Jack. He looks as concerned as anyone ever could about his wife and he truly looks motivated to make his way to the top in boxing. Ian Hunter does a great job as Bob, the rich boxer who also tries to get Mabel. Now Mabel is played by Lillian Hall-Davis who also happens to do a truly excellent job. All of the minor roles in the film are also catered to perfectly.

Each of the sets in the film are done pretty well with the carnival at the beginning and all of the boxing rings looking pretty realistic for the time. The hits between boxers are very good for the most part as it usually looks like they are actually making contact. The musical score for this film is one of the best that I've ever heard in a silent film and it truly leaves the viewer with a wide variety of emotions.

With all of the praise that I just rained upon this film you may think that I'm going to say go out and see this film immediately but in reality it feels like less than the sum of its parts. The story is very good while not perfect, the acting is excellent, the special effects are pretty good, and the music is truly stupendous. So not everything in the film is perfect but there really aren't that many noteworthy flaws. I'll say check out the film if you enjoy boxing, love stories, or Alfred Hitchcock.

8364351,3,B002CQUCBM,"I'm actually a fan of ""NUMBER 17"", I like Hitchcock's use of light & shadow to create the mood.  Yes it is a little slow & stagey, but I get engrosed by the visuals.

And there lies the problem with this Laserlight/Delta DVD.  The picture quality is horrible, full of digital artifacting that makes the picture appear to freeze in sections then play again.  The details get lost in the pixilation.  How can you enjoy a visually engrosing movie if it looks terrible.

I have an old Japanese Laserdisc of this movie, and it looks much better!

Japanese videos are NTSC format, so they will play on U.S. televisions.  I would rather watch the Japanese Laserdisc with Japanese subtitles on screen that this awful Laserlight/Delta DVD.

And about ""THE RING"", Studio Canal / Lionsgate has released a nice 35mm mastered copy in a DVD box set: Alfred Hitchcock, The Early Years of the Master.",1170979200,,884,4.688311688311688
8364352,4,B002CQUCBM,"Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock.  One of the only original screenplays written by Hitchcock himself, this film shows remarkable story structure.  It kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ ""One Round"" Jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter.  The movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, his girl and the professional boxer.  The rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown.  Even in this early film, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement.  An armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness.  The only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927.  The final match, as a result, ends up being somewhat anticlimactic.  The story, though, is what carries this film through.",1120521600,,1049,4.9147727272727275
8364353,5,B002CQUCBM,"As a life-long fan of Alfred Hitchcock, I've read most of his screenplay/books. He's truly one of the Sci-Fi, Horror, Mystery, Thriller ""Movie"" Leaders! I can thank him for my creative writing today! He is one of the Leading Great's of today's Sci-Fi Movies, you can not expect his ""technoloy"" to follow today! His first completed film was in 1925! Imagine that! With his education at the St. Ignatius College in London England so many years ago, (the college-a School of Engineering) he was great in his time! Born in 1899, his untimely death in 1980, his last film (which he directed only) was in 1976, he was great! His Screenplay-The Ring is the best! Take a look! He more than deserves my five star rating and my lifelong respect!",1094515200,,735,4.661538461538462
8364354,3,B002CQUCBM,"Laserlight claim to have used the best available source material for the ""best possible"" transfer to DVD.  I find this hard to believe.  The picture lacks black/white contrast, is noticeably cropped and slightly rotated in the field of view.  If you can get hold of a UK Universal copy of 'Number 17', you won't have any of these problems.  (American readers beware that if you get a UK video it will be in PAL VHS format.)  I haven't seen any other copy of 'The Ring', but I suspect the same criticism will hold.
I rather like both these films.  The Ring is very much a 1920s period-piece, but Hitchcock throws in occasional odd filming angles that seem ahead of their time.  Number 17 does have a plot (despite disbelief elsewhere!), and there's a summary on the box.  The scene where the hero and heroine are handcuffed to the bannister of a gallery in the Number 17 house is very Hitchcock.  Worthwhile, but it needs a better transfer than this.",1081987200,2,949,4.568047337278107
8364355,3,B002CQUCBM,"I tend to dwell more on the technical side of the these Hitchcock Laserlite DVDs, than the movies themselves and this one may end up being that way for no better reason than the fact that this movie is just plain confusing! My recent viewing of the film ""Number 17"" was only the second time I'd ever seen it and I can easily assure any reader of this essay that I am more confused than I was after the first viewing. I can't decribe the plot because I don't really know what's going on. It starts with a tramp and a seeming gentleman finding a dead body in an old house, then the victim's daughter happens upon the two men, the body disapears, some jewel theives come to the house and cause havoc, then somehow they all (including the dead man who's not dead) end up in a train which leads to the grand finale: a chase between the train and a tour bus that comes out of nowhere. The special minerature effects at the end have often gotten flack for looking fake, but I believe now, as I did with my first viewing, that they don't look any worse than King Kong's stop motion animation on top the Empire State Building.
The second feature, ""The Ring,"" is a lesser known and surprisingly entertaining Hitchcock silent drama about a circus ticket girl torn between two potential lovers: one a prize fighter, the other his sparring partner who happens to be the only man that can beat him. The plot sounds typical and forgettable, but don't let that fool you. Hitchcock adds a lot of very innovative visual flair to the film and the acting is pretty passionate not overly dramatic as a lot of silent acting performances tend to be.
The DVD transfer of ""Number 17"" is fair. The sound is full of annoying hiss which can be reduced by turning off the surround sound and turning up the bass up on your stereo, the contrast is annoyingly jumpy (too bright in some scenes and too dark in others,) however, it does remain flat for the most part, which is better than scenes being washed out all the time like some film transfers. Of ""The Ring,"" I understand that not everyone can handle the silent treatment, but the intelligently chosen mucial accompaniment by Laserlite makes the movie an easy one to get through, even though the film was transferred at a slow speed, making the movie about 15 miutes longer than it was intended to be.
Rumor is Hitchcock was forced to do ""Number 17"" and even though it's far from his best film, it's almost just as far from his worst film too, and since it's obscure enough that it probably won't get a full-on restoration any time soon, it deserves a better treatment than what Laserlite has given it. But, to Laserlite's defense is the fact that they didn't have to release it at all and the low price tag on the disc plus the addition of ""The Ring"" makes it a good collectible for the budget-minded Hitchcock nut.
3 stars to Hitchcock for his confusing but, at times, entertaining film ""Number 17,"" and his entertaining Silent treat ""The Ring"" and 3 stars to Laserlite for trying but not trying harder.",1044403200,6,3029,4.479204339963833
8364356,3,B002CQUCBM,"I haven't seen The Ring - these comments apply to Number 17. This feels like a series of short films, each with their own texture, rather than a coherent whole.  The opening sequence is a demonstration of the power of silent film (with the right music) to create tension - nothing has happened yet, but the suspense climbs tremendously: classic Hitchcock!  Later sections are more relaxed, and Hitchcock indulges in some jokes at the viewer's expense, before finishing off with a full-on action finale - and the shoddy special effects may have been part of Hitchcock's playfulness.  I really think he had a great time making this film, and I had a great time watching it.",1038614400,2,671,4.767241379310345
8364357,3,B002CQUCBM,"I'm going to sit right in the middle of the fence on this one.  I rather like Number 17 despite its all-too-apparent flaws.  It's one of Hitch's least leisurely films, running only an hour and three minutes.  The train/bus chase is wonderfully imagined, if you can get past the obvious model work.  The characters ARE hard to keep track of -- none are particularly engaging -- yet you find yourself rather quickly engaged by them and the truly silly, convoluted plot.
Unfortunately, Laserlight hasn't bothered with any restoration work, and the print is pretty awful on the DVD.  The most that can be said is that it's not as bad as most of the Madacy prints and that, with the addition of the silent feature, The Ring, the DVD is a true value for the Hitchcock collector.  And on that topic, The Ring has values of its own, including impressive performances by Carl Brisson and Ian Hunter.  Sadly, Lilian Hall-Davis's heroine is mostly trashy and unattractive.",972172800,5,961,4.753012048192771
8364358,2,B002CQUCBM,"'Number 17' is surely a contender for Hitchcock's worst ever film. Good points? Well I suppose it is of interest to Hitchcock enthusiasts and to any die-hard early British film fanatics. The picture quality is not great but fairly watchable. But when it is obvious that Hitchcock himself could not care less about this picture you know roughly what to expect. Plot holes, long stagey scenes, actions by characters that just don't make any sense, the list goes on. Although, I suppose these faults may even help to make the film more interesting than it would otherwise have been - the tramp character that went to the Dick Van Dyke school of 'cockernee' accents certainly raises a chuckle. But without the name 'Hitchcock' in the film's credits I doubt if any video company would have attempted to market this DVD. As for 'The Ring', this is another good Hitchcock silent let down by poor picture quality. I own a restored PAL VHS version of 'The Ring' which is amazingly good quality. So if you're only after 'The Ring' I recommend you track down a better copy. And if you're wondering why I give this DVD two stars instead of one - well this is a budget DVD and Laserlight are at least prepared to release this old material so credit where it's due.",962064000,4,1251,4.614349775784754
