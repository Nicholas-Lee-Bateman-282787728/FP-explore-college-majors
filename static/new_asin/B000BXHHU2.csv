8093855,5,B000BXHHU2,So happy to learn something about this great preacher of the gospel. The sermon performed at the end made it plain why people came in droves to hear him. Very simple and understandable.  I imagine it was a great contrast to the sermons read in the Church if England of that day.,1391299200,,278,4.346153846153846
