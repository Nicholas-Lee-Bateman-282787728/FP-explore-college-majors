8639831,5,B00I8N2AX6,"I Am Hardwell traces the beginning of his music career from December 2010 to his rise to DJ magazines top 100 DJ list of 2013 (fellow top 100 DJ Armin Van Buuren is shown introducing Hardwell at the end of the documentary). The only catch to this documentary is that English is only spoken part of the time and language subtitles are unavailable in the rental version . However, watching the I Am Hardwell documentary was very inspirational, along with his message of If You Can Dream It, You Can Do It.  I needed to watch such a dvd because I do not plan on being a DJ (I prefer to keep my career dreams secret for now). However, part of me was beginning to wonder if having either too many and/or big dreams is kind of Pollyanna like.  Watching his documentary and how he generously shared his action plan helped inspire me to revise and reassess my own action plan to my secret dreams.  The following are some of the facts shared in his documentary:
January 25, 2013: Hardwell announced his first concert.
In 2011, Hardwell made his first appearance at Sensation, one of the worlds leading Dance Events. A version of Tocas Miracle by Fragma can be heard at this event.
New York was one of Hardwells stops when he did a summer tour back in 2012.
In 2012, Hardwell was voted both Breakthrough artist and #6 DJ in the world.
He has also performed at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Florida/",1397865600,,1393,4.454901960784314
