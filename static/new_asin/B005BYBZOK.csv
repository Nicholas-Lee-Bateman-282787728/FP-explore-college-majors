8464566,5,B005BYBZOK,"I love Christmas movies and start watching them right after Thanksgiving.  Both movies are enjoyable, but it is Christmas in Canaan that got the five star rating - I really love that movie.  I look forward to viewing Christmas in Canaan each holiday season.",1447977600,,257,4.818181818181818
8464567,1,B005BYBZOK,"REALLY ONLY WANTED ""ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS"". RECEIVED ONLY CHRISTMAS IN CANAAN.  I SHOULD GET MY MONEY BACK. DISAPPOINTED",1387324800,,123,5.15
8464568,5,B005BYBZOK,I love this movie.  I saw it a few years back and my memories were fond and now I have watched it again and it was better than I remembered.  A great performance by Billy Ray Cyrus and all the cast.  The emotions are portrayed in a very good manner and it can really make one realize and ponder how prejudism can affect those we love and care for and even those we don't.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone!,1330905600,,413,4.061728395061729
8464569,5,B005BYBZOK,"Great movie for the entire family. The one thing I wish they would have left out was one cuss word, the good have just said, ""Don't be an old fool"", so that we didn't have to put the TV on mute! For the kids that are not aware of what went on back in the 60's it's a good way for them to understand how hate can distroy a relationship. It teaches how to forgive and how to appreciate what you have, even if you don't have much money, with love an faith, you'll get by. It teaches that family can include anyone you love, it doesn't have to be by blood!",1327449600,,552,3.9375
8464570,5,B005BYBZOK,"I ordered these movies because I just like Christmas movies!  There were fun to watch and the Canaan one I especially liked.  The other one was more ""fluff"" but fun.",1326672000,,165,4.466666666666667
8464571,5,B005BYBZOK,"I  love both of these movies.  Christmas in Canaan is by far the best movie and its moral message is great family entertainment.  I grew up during this time and remember about people's attitudes.  All I want for Christmas is a fun movie and not as realistic as Christmas in Canaan, but is still excellent entertainment for the whole family.  I am pleased to be able to share both films, at a great price by the way, with my children and grandchildren.",1325116800,2,451,4.451219512195122
8464572,5,B005BYBZOK,This duo of holiday movies is awesome! Definitely gives Christmas and extra touch to it. Would recommend for those who are into Christmas movies.,1324944000,,145,5.083333333333333
