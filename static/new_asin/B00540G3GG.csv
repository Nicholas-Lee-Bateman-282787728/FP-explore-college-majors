VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Off the Map: The Complete Series"" is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions. For a TV series, ""Off the Map"" has a similarity to a series like ""LOST"" because they are both filmed in Oahu, Hawaii.

Because so much of the series is shot outdoors, ""Off the Map"" definitely looks beautiful!  The location shots look very good and you know that it would even look better if this series was released on Blu-ray, but on DVD, picture quality is very good.

As for audio, ""Off the Map: The Complete Series"" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, the show is mostly dialogue-based but there are quite a bit of action sequences and you can hear the ambiance of the environment through the surround channels.  Granted, it's not very active soundtrack but its still better than most drama television series.

Subtitles are in English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Off the Map: The Complete Series"" comes with the following special features:

DISC 3:

  On Set at Off the Map - (8:18) The producers and cast talk about how unique ""Off the Map"" is from other medical drama series because of its use of action.  Also, how the more difficult scenes of various episodes were shot.
  Jungle Medicine - (4:53) Jenna Bans talk about the medicine used in the remote jungle and the research that went into the medicine used for the series.
  Deleted Scenes - A total of eleven deleted scenes.
  Bloopers - (2:14) Outtakes from ""Off the Map"".

EXTRAS:

""Off the Map: The Complete Series"" comes with a slip over case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to medical dramas, Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers definitely know what they are doing.  Having two shows on ABC, ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Private Practice"", the duo have joined executive producer Jenna Bans to create another medical drama titled ""Off the Map"", but in this case, making the series different by incorporating action/adventure together with medicine.

While the series manages to capture the elements of different medical emergencies and issues with each episode, especially from a remote area near the jungles and ocean in the middle of nowhere, I think that perhaps too many medical dramas on a network can be difficult.

We have seen it in the past when there are far too many police series, too many investigative series and too many law series and they don't last.

With two medical series, I felt that people weren't ready to watch a third and that is rather unfortunate because ""Off the Map"" is a pretty unique medical series because it doesn't take place in a metropolitan series and I found some of the medical emergencies to be quite intriguing.

Granted, I don't know how farfetched the storylines are, for example, in one episode, a green anaconda nearly crushes a photographer and the doctors try to rescue him.  And of course, you have rockslide, mines trapping people looking for gold and it's a different type of series that you just don't see on television.  But at the same time, I have heard from actual doctors working in remote villages that the series is extremely romanticized for entertainment and people who were disappointed by how unrealistic the portrayal was.

As for the characters, it's a different dynamic once again compared to ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Private Practice"", where in those episode...it's always emergency issues and main characters constantly sleeping with each other.  While you see a little of that in this series, the sex doesn't dominate the series and for me, that is a positive!

While the location of the series definitely has many beautiful scenes (once I saw the rock formation and blue ocean, I knew that it was shot in Hawaii where ""Lost"" was filmed), the show has episodes that were overly predictable but then again, many other top medical dramas have had their share of predictable storylines as well.

Overall, I actually enjoyed ""Off the Map"" because although a medical drama series, it had that action/adventure element incorporated to it which made it a bit more exciting.  It's sad that the series was canceled but at the same time, you could only have so many medical drama series on television and perhaps it was a bit much for viewers.

But I suppose if one is looking for a different kind of medical series that are only 13-episodes long, ""Off the Map: The Complete Series"" is a series worth checking out!",1315180800,16,8234,4.614748449345279
4555929,5,B00540G3GG,Off The Map was an awesome series...abc did not give this show a chance...i mean when u air the show against AMERICAN IDOL you know it aint gonna do good...i mean use the smarts... but i will own this and watch every 13 episodes over and over...it was different from any other hospital drama show out there and i loved it and the hott MARTIN HENDERSON helped alot lol,1313884800,14,367,4.333333333333333
4555930,5,B00540G3GG,"Poor Caroline Dhavernas, she's so underrated, and is involved in such great work. For those of you who don't know who she is, she played Dr. Lily Brenner, and is most well known for yet another short lived show: Wonderfalls. For those of you who don't know what that is, go check it out, now- I'll wait. Saw it, great, isn't it? But, alas, it only lasted four episodes (the other 9 were released with the 4 on DVD). This was the reason I started watching ""Off The Map."" I'm not a medical drama person, so the Shonda Rhimes credit didn't mean much to me, it was Caroline that pulled me in, and boy was I glad she did.
  From first glance, ""Off the Map"" is your typical Medical Drama, but that's when the old adage, ""don't judge a book by its cover"" comes into play. ""Off the Map,"" for me, is ""Pushing Daisies"" in its own right. Now, don't get me wrong, nothing like ""Daisies"" will ever come along again, (if you haven't seen Pushing Daisies, go check it out, now- again, I'll wait, I've got all the time in the world) but ""Off the Map"" shares a similarity in its uniqueness.
  Each Episode is packed with interesting tragedy, accidents, and relationships. The same equation we all know and love. But, here's were the uniqueness comes into play, its set in a third world South America country. Each episode chronicles the hard work of several American doctors in the area's only Clinic, and possibly the country's only advanced clinic. Note, that these are American doctors, who all share their own back story, the reason they were brought here, but again, American doctors, who don't speak Spanish, or understand the culture in which these people live. More difficulties arrive when the revelation that the many patients in the clinic object to medicine, do not trust these doctors, and do not trust their prognosis.
  ""Off the Map"" was a brilliant show marketed has a medical drama, but is so much more. It's also a message, that in tough, unsure times, where we live in a turbulent economy, it is often easy to pity ourselves, but this show throws people who come from similar situations, into a situation that presents cultural, lingual, and religious barriers, and shows that while we can pity ourselves, there are other people out there who are in even worse situations. I write this, trying to avoid getting very preachy. And if you choose to ignore the message in this cancelled too soon show, you'll enjoy it just the same, its that good of a series.",1312416000,41,2457,4.598173515981735
4555931,4,B00540G3GG,"Off the Map is a medical drama created by Jenna Bans, who also serves as an executive producer, with colleagues from Grey's Anatomy, Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers.

He is shown to have ""barely made his way through medical school"" according to Cole. Tommy had a brief crush on Ryan, until he found out she was dating Keeton. He had a relationship with a local girl named Alma, but due to lack of knowledge of each other's language, he finds it difficult to be around her.

He tells Brenner this and she says go for it, when he dose he finds Mina in the shower with Phur. Tommy is shown to be upset when he sees Mina and Phur together.

In episode 4 Mina says that her father is the head of a major Boston hospital, and when she misdiagnosed Eric he wiped her resume clean of the incident. She appears to have some kind of attraction to Cole after they share some close moments. In episode 8, Mina sleeps with Tommy while she is drunk after a party for her new god-daughter.

4555932,3,B00540G3GG,I was very excited when I first saw advertisements for this show on TV.  Martin Henderson is one of my favorite actors and was excited to be able to see him on a regular basis.  But as I watched the show I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters.  The general idea of the doctors in the wild is extremely appealing but the execution was a bit sloppy in my opinion.  It wasn't a horrible show but I'm not in any way surprised that it got cancelled so fast.  It was worth watching once.  And honestly I never finished the whole season.  The last 3 episodes are saved in my Hulu queue and I can't bring myself to care enough to know how its ends.,1310774400,2,661,4.1171875

4555945,1,B00540G3GG,"While the scenery was beautiful and the sets and acting were quite good, there are so many totally blatant errors in the medical procedural aspect that for anyone with a healthcare background it is not only ridiculous but maddening.  Don't know if there was any medical advisor for this series, but if so, they were WAY OFF.  Medical programs would be so much better off to simply omit trying to show the extremely dramatic diagnostic and treatment procedures rather than to show them completely and embarrassingly wrong.  For people without a medical background, the show is quite watchable and even entertaining.  For me, however, the multiple glaring mistakes in medical procedures are just too ridiculous and offensive and I won't be trying to watch any more beyond the 3rd episode.",1490918400,,786,5.023076923076923

4556036,5,B00540G3GG,"My only question is why was this series ever cancelled, it's so good. I missed the first epiosode so I never watched the show. I had heard from so many people how good it was. So I had to order it and see for myself. They were right it is an amazing series. I just don't understand the canceling of programs on TV now days. I really enjoyed the romance and the interaction of the actors on this series. I simply wanted more.",1353369600,2,424,4.120481927710843
4556037,5,B00540G3GG,"This series has everything, a bit of nostalgia, mystery, mayhem, romance and its also a bit of a thriller. The cast are a stellar cast and the setting is just purely magical. This is a must have for all lovers of medical drama!",1336953600,,227,4.3023255813953485

4556040,5,B00540G3GG,"This is a great show that has everything a medical drama needs to keep you interested. The characters are diverse and use their differences to create a good range of humour, tension and support between them. I was concerned that the DVD's may not be compatible with my player but they worked fine, no problems unlike some I have recently purchased that are not compatible.",1327536000,,372,4.7384615384615385
4556041,4,B00540G3GG,"""Off the Map"" was a good concept gone awry.

This was a series with a strong lead cast (Henderson, Castellanas, George and Cruz) and a fair to weak supporting cast (Dhavernas, Gilford, Gummer, Lefevre). In saying this, however, the full cast began to strengthen as a unit toward the end and it is unfortunate that this melding did not present itself early on.

The patient stories were intense...more intense, perhaps, than the supporting cast could believably manage.  One of the reasons I kept up with the series, was due to the episodic characters and their stories. Although the cliffhanger at the series finale was intriguing, I sensed a repetition in character experience/story on the horizon.

All in all, I would have liked to see the series continue.  I thought Mamie Gummer had the most potential in strengthening her role, had the series went into a second season.

Cheech Marin was great as Papa Ucumari.",1325203200,2,916,4.915584415584416
4556042,5,B00540G3GG,"I hate medical dramas....Off The Map was not a medical drama, it was a well written mixture of genre, medical, drama, adventure, danger, and even a little educational.  This was one of the best shows to come down the pike in a long time.  I was taken by complete surprise by its cancelation...Could this show not be marketed to another network or to cable?  The action was superb, the plots realistic and each episode left me hungry to see the next.  I guess I was a fan of one....sorry to see it go...",1323216000,,502,4.365591397849462
4556043,5,B00540G3GG,"Why does ABC always seem to cancel the shows that really could be GREAT?  This show is one of them!  It had really interesting characters, and of course a fantastic locale. I always waited with great antiscipation for Wednesday nights. I'm with the others, I will buy the DVD and watch it over and over. ABC really blew it on this one.",1318118400,,335,4.387096774193548
