7807185,5,6300229416,"Long, long ago in the days of electric drum kits, white suits with no socks and when mullets were HOT, MTV created one of the greatest pop musical revivals of the 20th century! It was as if someone had put one of the most popular groups of the 60s into a deep freeze and then thawed them out 20 years later for a whole new generation to climb aboard the train to Clarksville. This video, produced by Nickelodeon and Rhino Records is an attempt to capture that wave of a comeback.

Heart & Soul is essentially a 40 minute promotion of The Monkees' 1987 album ""Pool It"" - possibly one of the most polarizing albums of The Monkees catalogue. The music is heavily laden with synthesizers and more synthesizers, but there are a couple of gems that genuinely held up through the test of time. The real treasure in this VHS is with the music videos. This is where Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, and Peter Tork, (Michael Nesmith did not participate in this comeback), manage to recapture the irreverence and physical humor that made the original late 60s series so much fun. This is where The Monkees shine.

To add more bang for your buck, included in this VHS collection are interviews, clips from a Monkees convention and a couple of other surprises.

Considering the love/hate status of ""Pool It"", and the startlingly 1980s looks of The Monkees in this video, (if your last memory of them is from the televsion series - watch out!), it doesn't surprise me that this collection never made it past VHS status. That said, I love this collection! It's silly and nostalgic for me and I'm glad I own it.

If you love The Monkees (and remember the 80s), this is a MUST HAVE for your collection.",1451779200,,1678,4.528052805280528

It has a current (late 80's) interview with all three (no Mike), amusing footage from their current tour, and some clever music videos with music from  ""Pool It.""  They are still very funny and still very cute.",960163200,15,274,4.666666666666667
