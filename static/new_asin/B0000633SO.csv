7958313,3,B0000633SO,"We already enjoy several videos by this same publisher and were hoping to see
more GREAT scenes. However what we found is that this video is 50% cut and paste from videos we already own. Overall the video is short too. Thus, the 50% that is new footage to us is very brief. If this is your first purchase of this series, I think you will give it 5 stars. Just know that if you are coming back for more, there are not alot of new sights to be seen.",1186444800,3,447,3.977777777777778

Image products have the most fantastic music to go along with their national park series, and I get customers praising the dvd's constantly, and some I have to give the address to so they can buy them. For a relaxing time, and great music it's a must.",1102204800,7,337,4.2
