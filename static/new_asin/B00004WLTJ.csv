1366412,5,B00004WLTJ,"Set in the crime-ridden war zone of the South Bronx, Paul Newman is a cynical (but honest) cop on the beat. Ken Wahl is his young partner and Ed Asner the chief. The story is the craziness and ugliness of the city in general; specifically it's about Newman witnessing two other cops throw a kid off a roof during a riot and finally deciding, against the wishes of his fellow cops, to turn them in. The love interest has Newman falling for a nurse who's a junkie (she dies). Newman is in top form as is Wahl, and the setting couldn't be any more realistic. (For 1981; NYC has really cleaned up its act since then.) It's not an upbeat movie at all, but it's true and human from beginning to end. One thing that is annoying is Newman and Asner trying to talk in a tough Bronx accent - both sound plain funny at times and not at all natural. A good movie, and definitely worth a watch.",1125100800,3,881,4.218934911242603
1366413,4,B00004WLTJ,"Films about police officers underwent a fundamental transformation after the 1960s. Gee, I wonder why? Could it have something to do with the scurrilous effects of the Counterculture, that merry band of kool-aid pranksters and miscreants that worked tirelessly to undermine confidence in our public institutions? You bet it did, and the pattern continues today. Before the nuts took over the asylum, pictures dealing with police and other authorities routinely portrayed them as essentially honest, hardworking people devoted to public service and safety. Of course, there were exceptions, such as the crooked cops in noir films or the beat officer on the take, but these figures only served to reinforce the rule that most police officers were truly dedicated to their work. Nowadays, it's impossible to see a film that doesn't paint the men in blue as deeply corrupted by intolerance, bribery, extralegal murder, or whatever else passes as socially disapproved behavior today. ""Fort Apache, the Bronx"" constitutes a prime example of the ""new"" police film in several important ways, but it also contradicts itself in the process. No wonder this film wasn't a success at the box office; when tarring the cops with an unfair brush, it's absolutely necessary to do it in the clearest way possible.

Officer Murphy (Paul Newman) is a good cop. Sure, he's tired of toiling away in the hellhole that is the Bronx borough of New York City, and he's getting a bit long in the tooth to chase criminals through the streets, but at heart he believes in giving people a fair shake and not stirring up unnecessary trouble. His young partner, the narcissistic Corelli (Ken Wahl), thinks Murphy's a bit soft sometimes but will always support his views when the chips are down. Not every cop on the force, let alone every cop in Murphy's precinct (referred to as Fort Apache), harbors such idealistic aspirations. Some of these guys, primarily Officer Morgan (Danny Aiello) but many others as well, believe that any action is acceptable when dealing with the savages. And there are a lot of savages in the Bronx, including murderers, drug dealers, harridans and their flashy employers, and general lunatics. The two ideological poles, represented by Murphy and Morgan, exist side by side in an uneasy truce until a new commander, the rotund Captain Connelly (Ed Asner), arrives to take control of Fort Apache. Connelly is a real take charge type, a no nonsense cop who plays by the rules and approaches his new task with a fervor rarely seen in the Bronx. He's going to clean up the station, clean up his cops, and clean up the streets.

The first order of business is to solve the murder of two patrolmen that occurred immediately prior to Connelly's arrival. It's to the film's credit that this murder, which involves a harridan named Charlotte (Pam Grier), never finds satisfactory resolution. Most homicide cases don't. Instead, it serves as a thread to tie the rest of the film together, popping up from time to time to help move the rest of the plot threads along. Most of the film deals with Murphy's personal life, a life full of personal disappointment and moral quandaries. His relationship with pretty hispanic nurse Isabelle (Rachel Ticotin) puts the cop in a bad spot when he discovers she is a heroin addict. Too, the coupling takes a couple of shots on the chin when relations deteriorate between the police and the local hispanic community. The latter issue arises when Connelly's insistence on shaking up the Bronx touches off a riot after he orders the arrest of a local cell of revolutionaries. Even worse, Murphy and Corelli witness Morgan taking advantage of the riot to toss a kid off a rooftop. Murphy's world implodes when he tries to deal with Isabelle's addictions while simultaneously deciding what to do about Morgan's crime.

""Fort Apache, The Bronx"" works well as a gritty crime drama. You've got Newman slumming in his role as a tortured cop, Ken Wahl and Danny Aiello at their mouthiest, and Ed Asner busting chops as a tough cop. Pam Grier, a personal favorite of mine, simply cannot hide her natural beauty even in a role that requires her to portray a drug addled streetwalker. The atmosphere easily sets and reinforces the tone of the film: the Bronx resembles a war zone, with crumbling buildings and overgrown lots hiding all sorts of unsavory crimes and secrets. Police officers in this area of the city must act as disciplinarians, confidantes, and doctors all in the course of a single shift. I think this last point is one of the strongest elements in the movie, as it portrays what cops do every day in all of its sleazy glory. The most interesting theme, however, is how the film tries to reconcile different methods of policing. ""Fort Apache, the Bronx"" cannot bring itself to take sides when dealing with Murphy and Connelly. Rather, the movie shows how both methods, an occasionally lenient attitude along with one as tough as nails, are necessary to protect people. That's surprising since most cop films paint any effort to enforce administrative discipline as fascistic at best and satanic at worst.

While ""Fort Apache, the Bronx"" is far from Paul Newman's best film, it's worth a look. Sadly, the DVD version contains only a trailer and filmographies/biographies as extras. Even sadder is the fullscreen picture transfer. There's simply no reason to release any big studio film in fullscreen to DVD, especially one starring a big shot like Paul Newman. Viewers looking for a multi-layered cop drama with few concrete resolutions--in other words, a movie that at least remotely resembles real life--will probably find a few things to like here.",1105574400,2,5680,4.950733752620545
1366414,5,B00004WLTJ,"This is a classic film that hardly anyone that I know have ever heard of.  This is a shame since this is a movie that has hardly any of the cliches that clog up so many police dramas.  Paul Newman stars as a cop who tries to enforce the law without engaging in violence against suspects.  This sets him at odds with other officers including the new precinct captain played by Ed Asner.  This is the heart of the movie and it leads to a surprising conclusion.

1366427,4,B00004WLTJ,"n hindsight, FORT APACHE THE BRONX seems in part an after-effect of 1960s and early 70s demonstrations and war protests. As for the wretched South Bronx setting, I spent several hours there one strange night in 1977 and can attest that it then looked like a war zone. Everywhere were condemned partially wrecked buildings, rubbish-filled lots and 55-gallon drum stoves used to dull the night chill for the homeless. Much like the moon, this was an imhospitable place for any living thing.

SYNOPSIS--
The 41st Precinct is known as Fort Apache as it's a haven, an island of refuge for decent citizens against the overwhelming number of monsters and savages prowling their streets. Murphy (Newman) has been at Fort Apache for 14 years, far too long for his mental health. Busted from detective to patrolman for a single lapse in judgement, he still tries to be a good cop.

A new captain (Asner) who knows nothing about the South Bronx, institutes a crime sweep after two rookie officers are murdered in their squad car. The result of 100 dubious arrests is a noisy demonstration at the precinct that Capt. Connolly disperses with tear gas. Riots, arson and general anarchy ensue. Murphy and partner Corelli (Wahl) are sent to a rooftop to stop two men from hurling things at the cops. While there they witness a fellow officer (Aiello) throw an innocent kid off another roof.

Murphy and Corelli must decide if they should keep quiet. Further complications are Murphy's entanglement with a needle-addicted nurse (Ticotin), a fleet-footed burglar in a WWI flyer's hat (Guecia) and the fruitless hunt for an unknown cop killer (Grier).

1366433,2,B00004WLTJ,"Not really the cult classic that I heard it was. It was campy, cheesy and lacked depth.

  This 125 minute flick is a fast paced look at the life of the modern police officer in a depressing New York City neighborhood. Also features Ed Asner,Danny Aiello, and Pam Grier.

1366435,5,B00004WLTJ,"This movie had a lot of difficult hurdles to overcome, and the deficit was never reached. But what one has to judge is it's entertainment value, and it borders somewhere between outstanding and boring. Never mind the controversy, (that was made-up media hype), it never happened and the end result was a dismal failure.

By the time this movie was released, (1981), the Bronx was over the phase that this movie 'Hollywood-ed' in order to gain some attention. The story of the 60's and 70's unrest and socio-political conscious was not unique to the Bronx, but it was in the forefront of Modern American history and this was the back drop to this tale.

The high points to this movie are in the acting, the actors themselves and the writing, (superb and outstanding). The low points are with the weak and fractured storyline and the incomplete lives of the characters portrayed in this movie. In addition to this, the movie made the characters out to be lingering on the loony, and stereotyping all Bronxites as silly in nature.

Also, it was difficult to maintain an interesting flow and one can see that they certainly tried to keep one interested. But the loopyness was frustrating and it finally bored me. It probably made the grade for a television movie sitcom in production value. But as a front-line blockbuster film it missed by a long shot. It almost seems as if the movie was rushed out of production and into the editing room just to get it over with. What a shame....a real missed opportunity. There was so much potential.

In my honest opinion, I think the movie's staff truly wanted to get it over with. The reason for this was the lawsuit that writer, Tom Walker, brought forth against the makers of this film. The basis for Tom Walker's lawsuit was that the writers of the movie had stolen the ideas from the memoirs in his book, 'Fort Apache: Life and death in the city's most violent precinct'.

Although the courts ruled against Tom Walker, the damage was already done. I can only assume that in anticipating a settlement the movie staff lost interest in the project. This is only my guess...but it seems more than likely. I firmly believe that Tom Walker had good cause. There are striking resemblances in the movie and in the book. The key missing ingredient was the time-line.

The movie depicts all this unsettlement happening during the 1980's. The book firmly documents factual events from the late 60's and early 70's. The courts ruling was a simple outcome: One cannot patent an idea, and similarities simply aren't proof enough.

Regretfully, in a perfect world the movie staff should of owned up to stealing Walker's memoirs and should of worked with him to get his masterpiece into the public view. The result would of been positively unimaginable based on the potential this movie had. I rated this movie a five based on it's potential. But it's entertainment value should be closer to a three. Nonetheless, an interesting movie to watch. But more like the ones television broadcasters come up with.

One objectionable note was that the DVD was not available in widescreen, and the audio was not in stereo, but only mono. Making the experiance even more painful.
I took the risk of settling for that rationalizing that the rarity of the movie on DVD would justify the low quality. I was only partially right.",1256947200,3,3339,4.7547495682210705

1366438,3,B00004WLTJ,"In the war zone of the South Bronx, the police of the 41st Precinct have the worst absentee record in the city, the most disability record claims, the least conviction per arrests, and there's nobody doing anything and the men aren't motivated...

The first petition of the new captain Dennis Connolly (Ed Asner) was to make it clear that there is zero progress on the investigation on the murders of two policemen (killed on the opening of the film by an addicted hooker played nicely by Pam Grier). For the good officer the case must be cleared even if his men have to take extraordinary measures to clear it...

Murphy (Newman) comes from three generations of cops... All his friends are cops... He gets drunk every night... He is essentially honest and he doesn't trust anyone but his partner, Corelli (Ken Wahl). He is attracted to Isabella (Rachel Ticotin) who happens to be a heroin addict...

The film turns dramatic first when a body is discovered after a fire... Death was caused by injuries sustained in a fall... Murphy and his partner witnessed the officer Morgan (Danny Aiello) throwing an innocent kid off the roof... And second when narcotics dealers took a bunch of doctors, nurses and patients hostage...

Paul Newman's performance is vulnerable, masking his sensitivity with arrogance and showing a flash of charm and humor... It is a story of an ordinary cop finding the courage to stand up and be counted... As portrayed by Newman he is touchingly believable...",1217980800,8,1482,4.869047619047619

But I enjoyed watching it. Maybe Pam Grier had something to do with it. Regardless, as I grew older memories of it started to fade but I still remembered the title of the movie, which I love.

Anyway, I enjoy the fact I can see a youngish Paul Newman; I think he looks good. As I started watching the movie, then I wondered what ever happen to Ken Wahl; he was huge in the eary 80's (I believe).

Pam Grier is stink-nasty hot! Seeing her stoned out & dirty, for me, was a treat! I don't take movie rating to seriously - it's a movie, which means entertainment. I was entertained so I give it a ""thumbs-up"".",1209254400,,759,4.087248322147651
