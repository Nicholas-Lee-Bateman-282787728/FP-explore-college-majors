8151463,5,B000JKA2G8,"Miriam Nelson might not be a household name, but her work has touched and inspired generations of performers and audiences.  Her resume is the LONGEST I have seen, and to this day is STILL dancing and choreographing.

""Play Piano Play"" is a delightful combination that would be great as a duet and even as a solo.  If you like the smooth dancing of Eleanor Powell and Fred Astaire, this tap dance is right up your alley.

I'm a professional tap dancer and purchased this DVD as resource and reference in my tap library and DVD collection.  Thank you Rusty for yet another brilliant DVD.",1165190400,2,586,4.596153846153846

Miriam and Rusty are both excellent teachers.  BUT, the real draw for me were the classic film clips of Ms. Nelson (Her dance from ""Duffy's Tavern"" is worth the price of the DVD alone), and the wonderful interview segment.  Ms. Frank should have her own television show.  She draws the most interesting and eye opening stories from Ms. Nelson, and the time flies much too quickly (and it's a lengthy interview!).  All in all I would say this is not just an instructional DVD for dancers only....it's a tribute to a woman who has worked with, and touched 100's of the most celebrated performers in our history.  Bravo to both ladies, and thanks for the entertainment!",1161043200,,869,4.7218543046357615
