199058,4,1586640054,"Having watched this entire set, I can say that the quality of the content outweighs any qualms about sound or video quality. Yes, the picture looks more like an old VHS tape than a new DVD, but it's not THAT bad. I found it it didn't get in the way of enjoying one of the best documentaries ever made. Bottom line: if you're picky--make that super picky--about video quality, avoid this. If, however, you are really interested in an excellent documentary on the Silk Road, then take the plunge. You won't be disappointed.",1036281600,45,521,4.612903225806452

A doco is very educative for a viewer with even some acquaintance with regional environment.",1254873600,,356,6.26530612244898
7799500,5,1586640054,"This is a great documentary series.  I did not see the original VHS, and although these DVDs do remind of watching a VHS, it doesn't bother me in the slightest because I am not a videophile.  If you like Aurel Stein or are interested in history or geography, then you will find these to be very rewarding and the music sets a nice mood.  Definitely check these out.",1221868800,,365,4.338235294117647
7799501,5,1586640054,This is a truly superb documentary.  The landscapes are truly breath taking.  It's also a history lesson about a lot of the events that took place here.  You get right into Chinese history at the ground level as you travel on one of the most ancient and important trade routes in the world.,1190160000,,290,4.433962264150943
7799502,5,1586640054,"I saw the comments in these reviews about the alleged poor quality video but went ahead and bought the series anyway.  Very glad I did. You have to balance whether to focus on the content or cosmetics; I decided on the content, and the production is more than adequate. I have traveled some parts of the Silk Road that are featured in the film and it seemed to me to be a faithful presentation.  But having been there, I can personally attest to the challenge of getting to the remote areas, so this film may be as close as you may ever get to seeing them.  I can recommend this dvd series to those looking for an in-depth look at the Silk Road in western China.",1189036800,5,662,4.238095238095238
7799503,3,1586640054,"This documentary is good given the time at which it was made, and given the fact it was probably the only one of its kind back then.  For those who are interested, I compared this to the Marco Polo Trilogy by Monarex, which I also bought and found the following-

FOOTAGE: The Marco Polo Trilogy has better footage altogether, but the Silk Road Collection does have its fair share of interesting shots too.  Definitely not a horse falling 50 feet from a bridge into a turbulent river and somehow surviving unscathed, but interesting.  Silk Road Collection pulls a lot of its content from old Chinese television footage and pieces it together, which is fairly similar to how Marco Polo was made.  Marco Polo is just a newer version with better camera work and much higher quality video - the government had commissioned a lot of new video archiving ever since the late 90's.

LENGTH: The difference in length between the two is significant (Silk Road Collection being 630 minutes compared to Marco's 270) but unless you have a need for in obscene amount of footage I think that you would be very pleased with the concise, but not too concise, nature of the Monarex trilogy. Not to mention, Monarex has a fourth film about the Silk Road (Secrets of the Silk Road) which is not a part of the Trilogy, but might as well be given its subject matter.  So assume if you buy those four together, you have 360 minutes.

CONTENT: The Silk Road Collection is a collection of episodes, each covering its own little topic given the information at hand (which wasn't very much back in the late 70's).  The Marco Polo Trilogy and Secrets of the Silk Road are definitely broader in spectrum, which can be both positive and negative. The interesting aspect is that even though they are broader, they still provide more details given many recent discoveries in China since the 70's and 80's, not to mention the release of information from the government itself.  So even in its generality, I found that the Marco Polos gave a wide array of new information not found in the Silk Road Collection.

CONCLUSION:  The Silk Road Collection is like a full blown Greek Dictionary, where the Marco Polo Trilogy is like a book of Commonly Used Greek Phrases.  Personally, I enjoy the Marco Polo version more because I am not looking for the smaller details regarding the Silk Road.  I wanted a great overview and got it with the Marco Polos.  If you are a professor about to teach a course on the Silk Road, I would recommend BOTH.  Watch Marco Polo first, then Silk Road Collection.  If you are like me and looking to build your knowledge because you are interested and would like to be further educated on the ""Sleeping Giant"", Marco Polo all the way.

7799504,3,1586640054,"The DVD set is 410 minutes long. It contains some great film footage taken in the Dunhuang caves. It also tells the very interesting story of Sir Aural Stein, who traced the journey of the monk Xuanzang along the Silk Road in the 7th century and cajoled the monk caretaker of the caves into letting him have many precious scrolls and art pieces to take back to England. The DVD set, however, spends much too much time advertising itself. I would estimate that at least 60 minutes of the 410 minutes consists of self-advertising. It is also, incredibly slow paced. I am a professor and tried to show parts of it in my class and found the students very restless after about 20 minutes.",1175126400,5,683,4.516129032258065
7799505,5,1586640054,"Although this documentary series is twenty years old (and shows it technically), it is still ""must see"" viewing for anyone with a sense of romantic adventure travel!

A recent posting claimed that ""the Chinese-language edition that is available cheaply on eBay is not very good for anything but the visuals. The subtitles are extremely sparse and only essentially tell you the locations; the extensive commentary is NOT subtitled""

This is incorrect; the ten CD boxed set has a perfectly good English soundtrack; you just have to know how to select it from the Chinese-only options menu at the start.  I simply took a digital photo of the TV screen and then went down to our local Chinese restaurant, where the owner happily translated it for us over our meal.

A tad inconvenient perhaps, but at US$12.00 for ten DVDs, which contain the entire 30 one-hour episodes of the complete series, I'm willing to put up with that.  Quality control may be a problem; just check that all ten CDs are included in the box; that all of them are playable, and that your supplier is willing to make good any shortcomings.",1127260800,15,1106,4.769633507853404
7799506,4,1586640054,"Just to alert other people -- unfortunately the Chinese-language edition that is available cheaply on ebay is not very good for anything but the visuals. The subtitles are extremely sparse and only essentially tell you the locations; the extensive commentary is *not* subtitled.

As far as the visuals, I would say yes, they do show the age of the footage, but the transfer quality itself is about as good as it could be. It's certainly an exhaustive amount of wonderful material.",1119139200,8,480,4.925925925925926
7799507,4,1586640054,"Excellent documentary of a fascinating area.  If you are interested in this area, you will find this very enjoyable - I know of no other documentary that covers this territory so well.

The video quality is poor, as the other reviews state.  But the series is watchable.

The entire series was issued as an NHK box set in asia, which you can get on E-bay for much less then the partial box set released in the US.",1098057600,14,413,4.324675324675325
7799508,3,1586640054,We have watched the series on VHS--also a very poor transfer but fascinating film.  I had hoped the DVD would be a good transfer but sounds as if that is not the case.,1056240000,3,167,4.0606060606060606
