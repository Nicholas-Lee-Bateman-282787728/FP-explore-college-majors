The woman who stirred up this crap,really beloved him,and when he did not belove her back,she decided to cook his goose. The school took the easy road and ruined his career. She is really behated in this town.the movie showed her getting some support towards the end?Never happened. She did however make a fast buck writeing a pack of lies,selling to liberal Hollywood,and sucking in a bunch of stupid libs who write from there shirtsleve instead of there researching little brains.",1288742400,,659,4.7894736842105265
2183142,4,B0006FQJAE,"EVIL IN CLEAR RIVER premiered 1/11/88 on ABC's Monday Night Movie.

It's the story of a small Canadian town that's rocked by controversy and division when one concerned parent (Wagner) dares to challenge a popular high school history teacher (Quaid) who has an Anti-Semitic agenda.

Pete Suvac (he's also the town's mayor!) hides behind the Bible while drilling students with revisionist nonsense about the Illuminati, and the Zionists' control of banks and ultimately the world. They're also taught that the Holocaust is a hoax, Jews started WWII and they got what was coming to them.

After hearing son Mark (Brown) spout Suvac's radical views, Kate McKinnon asks the teacher for his sources and receives from him several revolting neo-crazy publications. Kate's extensive research in 100 other books proves irrefutably that Pete's ideas are terribly wrong. At first husband Glen (Flynn) is reluctant to get involved, but once he sees the animus his boy harbors for people he's never even met, Glen comes around to Kate's point of view.

She shows Mark's shocking class notes to the school board, which rules that Suvac must stick to guidelines and teach all sides of this issue. Kate wins a Pyrrhic victory, for Suvac uses their ""censorship"" to advance his skewed way of thinking with an adoring classroom of believers.

Again, Kate shows evidence that Pete still teaches hatred; he's discharged by the board. Next she campaigns for a vote of ""no confidence"" against him as mayor. All along, Kate's efforts have met resistance from other townspeople-- now they openly despise her. The public meeting where she introduces a recall vote rocks with hatred and the evil sown not by Kate but by Pete Suvac, yet --she-- is the target of nearly everyone's anger, as Cheshire Cat-grinnng Pete savors it all from his chairman's seat. The motion is voted down.

A prosecutor working closely with Kate then arrests Pete, and she's star witness in the first-ever Canadian trial of a man accused of hate crimes.

2183144,3,B0006FQJAE,"This movie really seems to be presenting censorship and the prosecution of a thought crime as an heroic struggle.  If you don't like what someone is saying or teaching it seems like open debate is the best remedy.  Truly kooky or dangerous ideas should speak for themselves.  Having a teacher fired without even parental consensus, and taking away their teaching credential seems more than enough-but sending them to prison because their views are politically incorrect?!  I hope and pray that this big brother legislation is not on its way to the U.S.!

On a side note, while I abhor the smoking police, any parent that smokes that much around their children should really keep their mouth shut about their well being!",1144108800,,719,4.909090909090909

8041377,5,B0006FQJAE,true story about anti semitism in a small town in canada with a zero population of jews and the courage of one mother to fight the entire town when she realized that the beloved teacher/mayor/coach of her son was indoctrinating his students with nazism. it is a story that needs to be told because it shows how one person can make a difference and also because anti semitism numbers are growing throughout the world.,1404950400,,416,4.635135135135135

8041380,4,B0006FQJAE,"The cover makes it look like there is going to be violence done, but don't expect some big physical battle between these two characters. Theirs is a spiritual battle, a battle of wills over right and wrong. Although the movie is a bit dated, the topic is still a relevant one--PREJUDICE. As a teacher, I have to say, I wouldn't like it if anyone were to try to control what I teach in the classroom (the situation the man is in), but as an ethical human being, I think this mother had not only a right but a duty to step in and monitor what her son was learning. Kudos to the mother for standing alone in the crowd. She is a good role model, and this David and Goliath story is worth watching. (I hope I didn't give away too much, but it is an old movie.)",1315958400,,755,4.108108108108108
