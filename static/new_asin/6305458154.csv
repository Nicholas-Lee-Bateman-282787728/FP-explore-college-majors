Leo wright is great on flute and alto, especially on Golsen's 'Blues after dark.' the rhythm of Chuck Lampkins sticks and Bob Cunningham's strings make this a great performance. There's just something about Dizzy, though. Everything I've heard of his over the years has surprised me with the conception and dircetion. He never loses his roots in Bebop and the blues either, a matter he discusses openly with Ralph during the interview section. The footage and sound is as good as it could be, judging from the era.

No matter who plays with him, I know they're gonna be top notch, as Diz is not only a great master, but a teacher. he taught me about Mama Africa.
