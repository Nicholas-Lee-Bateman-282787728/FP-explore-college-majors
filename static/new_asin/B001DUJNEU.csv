8294987,3,B001DUJNEU,"This is a really nice set for WW II buffs.  It has a lot of great footage.  The only drawback is that when it arrived it looked as though the box it came in had been through the war.  I am getting so tired of ordering things from Amazon (specifically books, and DVD sets) only to have them arrive with torn or ripped corners.  If I had ordered this set for a gift, I would have sent it back for replacement.  The edges of the box looked like it had been dropped, and the top of the box was torn.  Oh well.",1251849600,4,505,3.9019607843137254
8294988,5,B001DUJNEU,I purchased this item as a gift. So glad that I chose to order from an Amazon seller. The merchandise arrived quickly and was a good price.,1231632000,3,139,4.185185185185185
