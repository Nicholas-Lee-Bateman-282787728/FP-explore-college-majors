There's a bilingual version of ""Happy Birthday"" song in this video, counting, vocabulary about a party (cake, presents, friends, etc).  My kids are very excited to learn new Mandarin Chinese words with Bao Bei!",1260921600,,362,4.698412698412699
8216485,2,B000V4ZW2G,"Yes the children are cute and multi-racial but I just feel like for the money you are getting very little quality language instruction. I've been teaching my daughter Mandarin since she was 6 mos. (she is now 2.5) and I have all of these videos but I am not impressed. They will keep your little one busy with a lot of eye candy. They could put about twice as much instruction, and better instruction in each video. At one point the puppet starts talking, in English of course, about something off the direct topic.  It's really annoying because the dvd is only 30 minutes long. Again I will close my rant with the fact that these DVDs won't hurt anything if you can afford them. Given what else is out there, you may as well add them to your Chinese language tool box.",1247356800,3,769,4.3776223776223775

8216487,5,B000V4ZW2G,"I am a Chinese American while my husband is Caucasian. Although we speak English at home, we really want our daughters to be able to speak Mandarin as well. The Bao Bei DVDs have been great and definitely a hit in our home. My almost 3 year old is always asking to watch Bao Bei and my 10 month old is fascinated by the colors and characters in the DVDs.

What's most fascinating is that my almost 3 year old now can name all the colors as well as count in Mandarin. If you are a parent and want your kids exposed to and learn Mandarin Chinese, definitely get all the Bao Bei DVD series!",1217289600,,587,4.104347826086957
