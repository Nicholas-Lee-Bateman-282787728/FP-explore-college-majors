3431150,5,B0019BI11E,Terrific. Having two granddaughters it is awesome to have dvds out there like this that show them they can be anything they want. And the animation is just incredible! I find myself watching it out of fascination and appreciation of the anime. Highly recommend.,1221091200,4,261,4.954545454545454
3431151,5,B0019BI11E,I happened on Jane & the Dragon by accident as I was flipping through channels one day. OMG...one episode and I'm HOOKED! I'm an able-minded 46 year old woman and I just adore this show! The animation is simply magical and the storylines are meaningful for young and old alike. I highly recommend these DVDs! I know I'M going to get them!,1220227200,21,338,4.467741935483871
3431152,5,B0019BI11E,"I'm so glad this is finally available on DVD!  Hopefully the remaining episodes will be coming out soon as well.  This is one of my favorite TV shows - entertaining to both children and adults, and with a good combination of action, humor and thoughtfulness.  Good, clean family viewing with a moral to each episode meets knights, dragons & life in a medieval castle.

The premise is that 13 year old Jane has decided to become a knight rather than a lady-in-waiting.  No one takes her seriously until a dragon shows up, and Jane is the one who saves the day, becoming best friends with Dragon in the process.  Each episode involves either some new knight-in-training challenge, or sometimes just life around the castle.  The characters are nicely animated (this is done by WETA, the folks who did the effects for the Lord of the Rings and Narnia movies, so you know it's good!) and their personalities well developed.",1219968000,36,918,4.735849056603773

3431273,5,B0019BI11E,"This series is so charming! Jane is a great role model character for young girls, and there are two different boy characters as well. The imagery is spectacularly drawn, with such detail it seems as if the pages of the book came to life.
Fantastic for small children!",1359676800,,267,4.583333333333333
3431274,5,B0019BI11E,I was glad to find this series on DVD for my Grandchildren.  I was disappointed that only 2 of the 5 seasons were available though.  I would have gotten the entire series.,1356912000,,171,4.3125
3431275,5,B0019BI11E,"Normally, ""for all ages"" is code for ""perfect for extremely young children but will make the parents secretly want to gouge their eyes out."" Not so with Jane and the Dragon!  This show is wonderful for young children - my 8 year old stepdaughter adores it - but it has a sophisticated side that my husband and I can appreciate as well.  In fact, we often watch it on Qubo when she is NOT with us, and we genuinely enjoy it!

This is NOT like the movie Brave.  I watched that with my stepdaughter, and I was somewhat appalled by the movie's central message: It's okay to be rude, disrespectful, and disobedient, as long as you are convinced it's your ""destiny.""  By contrast, Jane and the Dragon teaches independence, but always within the bounds of obedience and real responsibility.  There are times in this series when Jane is told by those in authority (mother, king, etc.) to do things  that she doesn't want to do.  While Jane might complain to Dragon and others that she doesn't want to, she always DOES it. In life, sometimes, you have to do unpleasant things and things you don't want to do, for no other reason than that you are told to do them!  It's an important lesson, but one that few children's shows ever teach.

In short, the characters in Jane and the Dragon are very realistic in their struggles - Gunther's father is a jerk, Jane's mother doesn't understand what makes her tick, etc.  Their situations teach important life lessons, but not in an ""after-school special"" sort of way.  Seriously, buy this show!",1355011200,,1528,4.597785977859779
3431276,5,B0019BI11E,"I am 30 years old and I LOVE ""Jane and the Dragon""!! This DVD is great and includes some of the best episodes. I highly recommend it to anyone who loved the show!",1354838400,,162,3.9393939393939394
3431277,5,B0019BI11E,Bought as a gift. Great story for children. Easier for the adults to tolerate than a lot of the children's shows out there.,1351468800,,123,4.391304347826087
3431278,5,B0019BI11E,"I was fascinated by the animation from the very beginning. The characterizations and the voices are gently entertaining. My favorite characters are, of course, Jane and her Dragon. They are a winning duo of best buds The series is especially appealing because of its modern twist on roles.

3431281,5,B0019BI11E,"This is an excellent video for kids and grownups alike. It teaches core values of friendship, trust, honesty and diversity.

3431303,5,B0019BI11E,"Jane and the Dragon is one of the most charming children's television shows I have ever seen.  The series focuses on a medieval girl named Jane and her best friend Dragon.  Unlike most girls of the time, Jane chooses to take her destiny into her own hands and seeks to become a knight, rather than settling to become a lady-in-waiting.  The stories focus on (as one might expect from the title) Jane and Dragon's various adventures and stories.  These two make for great lead characters, and audiences are easily drawn to them.  But like most good shows, there is an outstanding supporting cast of characters, from the gardener Rake to the clever and witty Jester to rival squire Gunther.  Indeed, it seems as though every character has been very well thought out, and there is a great amount of depth to each and every one of them, whether they appear in every episode or merely a few.  The endearing cast of characters contributes much to the overall success of the show.

But this attention to detail is not just found in the characters -- it is in fact throughout the entire show.  The 3D animation is stellar (done by Weta Workshop -- better known for their work on the Lord of the Rings), the art design is beautiful, the music is catchy and the dialog is well written.  It only takes watching a single episode to realize the extraordinary amount of effort put into the show by its developers -- a trait that many other shows, children's or otherwise, would do well to emulate.

Each episode runs approximately 22 minutes long, telling an individual, stand-alone story focusing on Jane, Dragon, and often several of the supporting cast.  Like most children's shows, there are valuable lessons about life and friendship within the series; fortunately, these are integrated quite seamlessly into the stories and rarely ever feel forced or out of place.  The stories are complex enough that adults should find them enjoyable, while at the same time not becoming so complicated as to confuse children.

This particular DVD contains a set of 5 episodes from the 26 episode series.  The 5 episodes included are ""Tests and Jests"", ""Tooth Fairy"", ""Jester Justice"", ""A Dragon's Tail"", and ""Shall We Dance"".  Of particular note are ""Tests and Jests"", the introductory episode to the series, and ""Jester Justice"" -- an absolutely hilarious episode focusing on Jester and Sir Ivon (and indeed one of my favorite episodes of the entire series).  That being said, all 5 are quite excellent, and this serves as a great introduction to the series.",1291507200,7,2537,4.822170900692841
3431304,5,B0019BI11E,The writers of this program do an excellent and captivating job of story-telling for children in a positive manner!  I think even adults find the stories interesting.,1261958400,,166,5.148148148148148
3431305,5,B0019BI11E,"My husband and I are throughly enjoying the DVD.  How many Jane and the Dragon DVD's are there?  We have two DVD's, but we know there are still episodes that we do not have and that we do want.",1245974400,2,193,3.923076923076923

My 4 year old, 6 year old and I (at 41 years old!) all LOVE these shows. We don't watch network tv so we were utterly surprised at how very hooked we were after watching only the first episode on the first dvd from the library. I immediately ordered both dvds from Amazon. My girls have watched them over and over again, and still we get smiles on our faces each time we decide Jane is our pick to watch.",1235692800,,575,4.333333333333333

We are very pleased with the quality of this product.  With unique computer animation, humorous script, interesting characters, and comical storylines, this program is one that our whole family can enjoy.
Don't forget to check out the special features!",1234742400,,417,4.859154929577465
3431309,5,B0019BI11E,"Jane and the Dragon is one of my top-rated children shows of all time.

Jane is a girl who wants to be more than what others' wanted her to be.  She believes that she can do things as well as a man could, and sets out to be a knight.
As for the Dragon, he's a lovable lizard (haha).  Jane and him have a close relationship, and it's very cute and enjoyable to watch them fling nicknames back and forth at each other--such as the Dragon calling her ""Short-life"", as dragons live many human lifetimes, and Jane calling Dragon names such as ""You overgrown lizard!""  This never turns into a mean gesture, rather something you will grow to love and remember fondly.

The three best parts of the show are the characters, the art, and the messages that the show sends to its audience.

The characters that surround Jane are nothing more than a joy.  Even when you're annoyed with one at the moment, later on you can always see that they have more than one side to them, they're not flat characters.

For instance, it may be easy to dislike Gunther, but in some of the episodes, he shows that he doesn't always feel good about his actions, and often tries to make up for them in some way or another.  He's grown to be one of my favorite characters, actually.

Other characters such as Chester the Jester, Pepper the Cook, Rake the Gardener, and Smithy the Blacksmith support Jane through her quests, but also get plenty of their own time in the spotlight so you never feel like they're left out or unimportant.

The art is simply gorgeous.  It has a painted feel to it, and appeals to EVERYBODY.  And seriously, I mean that.  If you don't like the graphics, that's fine, but I doubt anyone could HATE them.  They're bright, colorful, vibrant, and different from other shows out there.  Very lovable.

As for the messages, each show carries one.  However, you never feel like the messages are forced, stupidly shown, or ridiculous.  They flow into the storyline, so it never feels like you're being preached at.  The show deals with things such as treating others as you'd like to be treated, helping your friends, being honest, bravery, accepting yourself for who you are and how you look, and standing up for what's right.
I, myself, think that just these alone are wonderful messages to send to kids, and there are many more like these in other episodes.

One recent episode may help children to understand their parents more-- it has to do with fathers, and how Jane thinks her father boring, dull, and overall unimportant.  Well, he proves her wrong when he is the only one in the castle who realizes that she has gone missing, and is the only one who can save her.  After the incident, she sees her father in a different light, and also sees that his protectiveness over her is not a weakness, but rather, a strength and a gift.

I WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO EVERYONE EVERYWHERE EVERYTIME.

Thank you :]  Hope this helped.",1234310400,7,2929,4.552581261950287
