2750753,5,B000MX7KF8,DVD-licous!....Ive been hooping for a few years and still learned SO much from this DVD. It is fabulous for beginners and experienced hoopers alike. It does an INCREDIBLE job on teaching moves (also in slow motion-which really allows one to SEE how the hands coordinate with the hoop)...but it also gives inspiration and a look at what is hoopDANCE beyond just an AWSOME workout!,1170201600,5,379,4.9375
2750754,5,B000MX7KF8,"What a fabuloous inspiration!!! The hoop dancers are so gorgeous in every way, and I AM ACTUALLY LEARNING THE MOVES FROM THE DVD!!!  Never thought I could do it, but the instruction works...and I can feel my abs getting tighter and I'm having fun doing it--I HATE crunches, etc., but this rocks!! I'm getting to look cool doing the tricks and my bod feels great for it.  There is such a treasure-trove of hoop moves on the DVD--I feel I got way more than my money's worth. I'm turning all my friends onto hoop dancing, and they're all ordering hoops and DVD. Way to go awesome women Christabel, Kamala and Hanna!!",1170201600,6,613,4.513513513513513
2750755,5,B000MX7KF8,"I love this video!  The settings are beautiful and very inspiring, and Christabel's presentation is tops - very clear and down to earth.  I am an experienced hooper and wish that I had this video when I was starting out, it gives more moves and detail than any of the videos out there.  It is the best hoop instruction video.  Having experience, I am still inspired and learn new things from it.  Any one who wants to know more about becoming a hoopdancer and about how to hoop should definitely get this video!",1170201600,9,511,4.451612903225806
2750756,1,B000MX7KF8,We made the mistake buying this for our daughter. It's a strange video of women wearing kooky costumes while explaining hula hooping and not young age appropriate outfits. My husband found it amusing.,1405555200,,200,5.090909090909091
2750757,4,B000MX7KF8,"Great workout Dvd! Seems a little complicated for beginners. Impossible to do these moves with a weighted hoop. Bought a 17oz hoop and now making progress! Great exercise for the abs, core and thighs!!",1399161600,,201,4.9411764705882355
2750758,5,B000MX7KF8,I like all of Hoopgirls videos. Purchased this and several others when I first started hooping and found them all helpful. Helped prepare me for my hoop class.,1394496000,,159,4.714285714285714
2750759,5,B000MX7KF8,Hoop Girl is amazing. She explains the moves in a way that you can pick them up and learn them. Hooping is a great way to loose weight and stay in shape. Hoop Girl is making it easy for many who thought they could never do it.,1375228800,,226,3.8297872340425534
2750760,5,B000MX7KF8,"DVD got here 4 days early and I was eo excited to start hoopin, DVDs really helpful and excellent for beginners",1367020800,,111,4.333333333333333
2750761,3,B000MX7KF8,This DVD is an OK instructional session.  I didn't care for the production quality which I felt was poor.  The Hoopnotica videos are much better if you are very inexperienced (like me).,1364947200,,185,4.75
2750762,5,B000MX7KF8,"This video covers a nice number of beginning moves.  The slow motion  and tips and tricks provided are helpful.  I don't think I would ever wear costumes like the ones depicted, but the locations are really nice.",1344902400,,212,4.675675675675675
2750763,2,B000MX7KF8,"I love Christabel and have great respect for her, and love the fact that she's from the SF Bay Area like myself, but honestly, this DVD isn't that great for beginners. She's so great at what she does that she flows straight through it and it goes by quickly, not really leaving any time for a beginner to truly breakdown the movements that she's doing in order to do a trick. The DVD could really use some ultra slow motion to break things down step by step. Also, the names that she uses for the moves are WEIRD. I don't understand why they aren't called what they are, you know, something that describes the trick itself. Spunk? Zest? Slinky? Swish? Booty Blitz? Whisper?! NONE of these tell you what the heck they are, and I bet you the majority of the hoopers in the hooping community would not be able to tell you what they are. I have the DVD and I still can't tell you.",1337040000,3,876,4.283132530120482
2750764,3,B000MX7KF8,"I'm usually not a reviewer, but felt I had to submit a review on this DVD. While it shows a lot of moves, I was really put off by the clothes and the music (which I found extremely jarring/repetitive and too much of a mix of new world/dance.) Yes I know, it's all personal taste... I just couldn't get motivated to watch the performance pieces cause of that annoying music! I saw a Youtube of Christabel on R&K and that music was fantastic! Will this DVD teach you how to hoop and some tricks? Yes and no. There are aspects where she spends some time explaining the move, but I'm more of a technical person... ""imagining myself moving around like a cobra"" makes me go ""Hrrmm ok, a cobra moves like this"" I'd RATHER have ""the hoop should be touching these points, and this is when you should be pushing/pulling."" Again personal preference, but for those out there like me, I'd recommend turning the music down, and supplementing this dvd with other things.",1327104000,,955,4.526011560693641

I received my DVD today. I watched it all in one sitting. Unfortunately, i have a sprained ankle at the moment so, i cannot try out any of the moves :-( I am looking forward to perfecting every single move both ways in the next three months. Some comments in other reviews mention the flawlessness of hoop girls moves. Yes she is flawless but we have to remember that she has hooped for yonks!!!!  I think it is important to listen to the instructions as much as you watch what she does. Expecting yourself to be as perfect as she is, is unrealistic in the extreme. As they say, Practice makes perfect. With time and effort I believe that we can all achieve that level of flawlessness.
I love the moves not the outfits. I do not feel that it is necessary to dress in such a manner to achieve grace and beauty however, I watch to learn hence I will continue to watch. I will ignore the outfits and focus on the tutorials. Knowledge is power.
I will definitely be getting the intermediate and experienced DVDs. I will practice,  practice and practice. I have bought all 4 hoopnotica DVDs  but beautiful as she is,  I find that I will spend more time with hoop dance as she has a lot more moves in one DVD ( on and off body) than hoopnotica has  in 3 DVDs combined.

As for you tube yes it has some decent, good and excellent tutorials however, it does not have some of the off and on body tutorials I have been looking for so it cannot surpass the DVD. Remember you are a student. Practice each chapter until you are in perfect harmony with your hoop before you move onto the next move. I know I would also love to fly before I can even walk hence the sneak preview of all I have in store for me.

Hoop girl if u read this I would welcome an instructional mini hoop DVD from you as you have passed the test of what I am looking for in terms of instructions.

Hope this review has helped. I am in the UK  but ordered this from the US as I could not find it anywhere else.",1315353600,3,2132,4.5
2750766,5,B000MX7KF8,"I am enjoying this DVD.

You need a professional hoop, but I already had one.

My only problem is that you need lots of space to practice the routines. I take my portable DVD player outside and practice there. I was hitting too many pieces of furniture and the ceiling and walls when I practiced in my house.",1310256000,,308,4.293103448275862
2750767,1,B000MX7KF8,"I love everything about Hulaerobics which is why I went ahead with purchasing this one. I was quickly disappointed. This dvd is not made with beginners in mind. It is very frustrating. Christabel, the pro that she is, flows through each move so seamlessly that it is impossible to make it out enough for you to copy. It does not help matters that she combines her fluidity with speed and rushes through the dvd. My dvd is now here collecting dust. Every time I try to use it, I am quickly reminded why I have not used it in so long. I think I am going to sell it. Hit me up if interested :).",1298937600,3,591,4.147826086956521
2750768,5,B000MX7KF8,This is the perfect beginner video!  Extremely well done and beautiful.  The girls are very talented and the instructions are clear and visible.,1281225600,,144,5.217391304347826
2750769,1,B000MX7KF8,"While trying to find a better than average hula hoop for my grand daughter, I thought she would enjoy the hoop dance cd to go along with it.  Surprise--it did not include a hula hoop and we argued with the usps for two weeks trying to find the actual hoop.  I found it impossible to contact Amazon which is a major shortfall in their customer service.  Paulh",1280102400,,358,4.313432835820896
2750770,3,B000MX7KF8,I had watched her perform on GMA and was very impressed with her and looked up her DVD.  I looked her up and emailed her about producing a DVD for children so I could use it to learn to teach in my P.E. classes.  She recommended this one.  I learned some of the moves and was able to teach my students but because of the outfits did not feel comfortable using it as a resouce to show my students.  I have a prosthesis in my leg leg which limits my activity so I cannot do all the skills and would have liked to use it in my classes because many of the students could perform them.  She is very talented and it has an excellent breakdown of the skills and could be a valuable addition to a teachers curriculum... if it was age appropriate in its presentation(the outfits and clothing in the dvd).  If the clothing were different it would be five stars.,1269648000,,851,4.190184049079755
2750771,2,B000MX7KF8,"I did not find the DVD to be very helpful.  In fact, I found YouTube tutorials to be much, much more explanatory as far as learning the individual moves.  She is so flawless in this video that it is nearly impossible to see how she is really executing the moves.  In addition, the beginner hoops sold by the same company are not big enough or sticky enough for learners.  I recommend checking out the YouTube videos of Safire, Chemigal and Caroleena and purchasing a hoop thats at least 42"" for just starting out.  This DVD is not worth the money.",1262476800,13,547,4.43
2750772,4,B000MX7KF8,"I'll be honest, the production values on this dvd are not the best. it sort of reminds me of that whole joke that 90% of the budget of an adult video goes into the packaging. The same can be said here. Grainy picture quality, terrible menus....but other than that is is a very solid DVD.

It has a lot of on and off body exercises to go through, and 4 ""routines"" so you can combine all of the moves you learned throughout the DVD.

All of the instructions are clear and concise and at points where a move is more difficult, they do a good job of illustrating it through camera angles and slow motion. I feel like a little too much time was spent on off-body movements, which is a shame. Also, a lot of very beginner moves (like walking, spinning the hoop in the opposite direction) are nowhere to be found, which is fine for someone like me, who has been doing this for a little bit, but for a totally starting out beginner, those are valuable lessons that are missing.

I found the costumes and dance routine number set in Hawaii to be sort of hokey though. But that's a small complaint.",1255651200,2,1088,4.297560975609756
2750773,2,B000MX7KF8,"I really wanted to love this video, but I have found it to be severely lacking in any instruction. She is a fantastic dancer, but the explanations of how to do tricks was really strange. The slow-mo filming technique is about all this has going for it, because the voice-over skims over everything as if it's nothing - ""Just imagine yourself as a leaf on a tree..."" I will be going back to watching SaFire's tutorials on YouTube. She explains things much more clearly.",1252972800,4,468,4.583333333333333
2750774,5,B000MX7KF8,"I confess to being amazed at how much I enjoyed learning from this video! I'm a GUY, after all, and have reached the big 6-0! My girlfriend teased me in trying a Hoopgirl hoop, and I bought this video on a lark. After practicing with it in secret, I surprised my girlfriend on her birthday by performing several tricks that I choreographed into a hoop dance. Now I hoop for the pure pleasure of it. And, did I mention how buff I've become?  Thanks, Christabel. I'm ready for the Intermediate DVD!",1245024000,3,496,4.450549450549451
2750775,5,B000MX7KF8,"My hoop, which I received as a gift, was not getting enough attention, because I wasn't sure what to do with it except spin it around my waist - which is great for relaxing the mind, but I wanted to become more proficient. After watching this video I am inspired! It is a lot of fun to watch, and I am really enjoying trying out the various moves.",1244678400,3,347,4.117647058823529
2750776,5,B000MX7KF8,Fantastic DVD.  Covers a mulitude of moves with easy-to-follow instructions.  I would highly recommend this to anyone/ everyone interested in learning the basics of hoop dance.  There are some intermediate and advanced moves covered on this DVD also - so it's great for all skill levels.,1243987200,3,287,5.195652173913044
2750777,5,B000MX7KF8,"I love the HoopDance for Beginners DVD.  It got me started on my way to hooping.  Lots of fun music.  All the moves made easy.  Thanks for a great product.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HoopDance-For-Beginners/dp/B000MX7KF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HoopDance For Beginners</a>",1243900800,3,317,7.9714285714285715
2750778,5,B000MX7KF8,"After taking a HoopGirl workout series class from Heather Troy in Santa Cruz, CA, I sadly had to go back home to Sacramento where there were no HoopGirl teachers, nor many hoopers that I knew of, so as soon as I got home, I ordered a copy of the HoopGirl HoopDance for Beginners DVD to be my hooping companion.

Throughout that summer following my initial exposure to hooping, this DVD was on repeat over and over again on my TV, so that I could practice the moves and become a ""real' hooper. If you don't have a teacher in your area and you want to learn the basics (and beyond!) of hoopdance and hooping ""tricks"" then you've found the right DVD. The beautiful scenery, the costuming and the performers are a treat for the eyes; for hoopers and non-hoopers alike!

And besides, what other hooping DVD gives you 30 moves on ONE DVD? I've tried the Hoopnotica DVDs and a few others, and I was really disappointed with the limited number of moves that were demonstrated. This DVD is worth every penny ;-)",1243900800,13,1002,4.469945355191257
2750779,5,B000MX7KF8,"Christabel Zamor's HoopDance For Beginners is the perfect DVD for anyone interested in hooping as a means of getting fit, having fun, or learning some new dance moves! She and her fellow hoopers put on quite a performance in this 80 minute instructional DVD. It's worth it for the clothing, the settings, and the hypnotic movements of the hoopers alone! It's obvious to me that Zamor's intent is to spread her love of dance, hooping, fitness, fun, and spirituality...and I was so willing to go along for the ride. Fitness should be fun. It should cause us to focus and move our bodies from a feeling of inspiration. And inspired is how you will most definitely feel after just one viewing. I couldn't give the DVD or Zamor a higher endorsement!",1243900800,3,744,4.687022900763359
2750780,5,B000MX7KF8,"Take my word on this-HOOP DANCE FOR BEGINNERS IS THE BEST BEGINNER HOOPING CD OUT THERE!!!!! I never write reviews- but buying and using this disk has changed my life. Before buying this CD, I had tried other hoop disks out on the market- but none of them really showed me how to embody hoopdance. This disk brought it all home for me. Packed full of moves- and Ms. Zamor makes learning them so easy!  The knowledge and skill offered on this disk are are not rivaled anywhere else within the hooping community. Some of the other disks have aspects that make them valuable- but I owe all my gratitude to this hoop diva. She is amazingly talented, a fabulous teacher, and so much fun to watch! Ms. Zamor is, in my opinion, the leading authority in the hoopworld today. I can now shake it like I know what I am doing, and that is awesome :) Thanks Hoopgirl!",1243900800,4,854,4.371069182389937
2750781,5,B000MX7KF8,"Hooping has changed my life is more ways that I could have ever imagined.  Hoopgirl brings so much energy & enthusiasm to hoopdance, it is absolutely intoxicating.  Anyone can do this & have a blast.  Order a hoop & this DVD, then prepare to transform.",1243814400,4,252,4.555555555555555
2750782,5,B000MX7KF8,This is a fabulous instructional DVD for anyone yearning to learn the art of hoop dance.  I am so impressed with the way in which Christabel translates hoop dance moves with her words and her body to make it so easy for the viewer to understand and learn.  Remarkable!,1243814400,4,268,4.448979591836735
2750783,3,B000MX7KF8,"This DVD is okay.  I did learn a lot from it.  But after viewing Hoopnotica, I think it was the lesser of the two.  Some of the tricks are hard to follow because they don't mention which directiong the hoop is going and they leave some basic details out.",1230940800,4,254,4.142857142857143
2750784,5,B000MX7KF8,"This DVD is AMAZING and I absolutely love it. It delivers exactly what it promises in the description and more.

I have tried every kind of exercise out there, but nothing gave me such dramatic results as HoopDance For Beginners. Not only has my tummy toned and tightened, I've also noticed a huge difference in my arms, butt and legs. EVERYTHING has firmed up. I'll never forget when my husband first said to me, ""Woah baby.. You look GOOD!""  I never knew achieving a totally hot bod could be so much fun and make me feel so sexy.. but that's what HoopDance does. I'm addicted and you will be too!",1224201600,4,598,4.427272727272728

2750786,5,B000MX7KF8,"this is such a great way to learn hooping if you can't get to a class....actually it's also a nice reference even if you can!  I have taken a few hooping classes, but I am still learning soooo much from this video.

I saw that an earlier reviewer was upset that it wasn't a workout video...well I get a workout from doing it, but it mostly is about teaching you the moves for beautiful flowing hoopdance, which is a workout and a wonderful way to exercise...once you watch this a couple of times, you have a new workout that can always be expanded upon with all the moves on here!

Christabel is a shining light and she explains the moves very well, repeating them and showing them in slow-motion.

Happy Hooping!",1199664000,22,713,4.419847328244275
2750787,4,B000MX7KF8,This is a good dvd for beinners.  I am 60 and learning to do a few tricks.  I like the way she explains the different moves and how to do them.  I might not be able to do everything but I'm having fun and moving my body.,1194998400,4,220,3.6382978723404253
2750788,4,B000MX7KF8,"For aspiring hoopers, this is a great video. I've been hooping on my own for a year. I purchased this video to learn and perfect very cool dance tricks. I'm still working on mastering all the moves. Christabel explains each move throughly and there's even a section on combinations.

My only disappointment was the ""step-through"" move was not on this, but I was very pleased with several new moves I hadn't seen before and lots of floor hooping tricks. I highly recommend this to any hooper.",1187222400,6,491,4.709302325581396
2750789,5,B000MX7KF8,"I've been hoop dancing for over a year now and was self-taught, trying to just pick up tricks along the way by watching others.

I *highly* recommend it.  The scenery is beautiful and so are the dancers.  I like to watch the performances just for inspiration!",1184630400,11,450,4.439024390243903

No exercises, no substance, just a cutesy name for each trick, some yogi-sounding mumbo-jumbo (breathe into your hoop...) and the briefest of explanations for how to actually do these tricks.  I've watched it once.  Anyone wanting a slightly used copy for cheap, please contact me, I will never watch this again.

This is NOT an EXERCISE VIDEO.  Please stop it from being tagged as such.",1184630400,25,542,4.536082474226804

2750792,5,B000MX7KF8,"There are 3 reasons why I found this dvd to be a great beginner's dvd - 1) I love how you have the option of viewing it all the way through or each individual chapter/move. I can watch each move and repeat the move over and over. Trust me, it is a work out practicing these moves over and over again.
2) I love the way HoopGirl has set up some combo's for me to use. It is a great starting point and shows how the moves can flow, 3)  the performance part of the dvd is not only fun to watch, but inspiring. It is all about practice and flow with hoopdancing. My recommendation is to watch the dvd all the way through a few times.. it gives you a better understanding of the moves, the names of the moves,  and how to flow into them. If you get on Hoopgirl website, she also has music links that are wonderful to use for practice.",1171152000,8,829,4.0181818181818185

I love to workout with dvds, I buy them all the time and I have been trying new and fun workouts: and this dvd is not a workout dvd. I even bought a hoop and was really excited about this dvd. The instructor teaches you a different hoop ""trick"" in a studio and then is in Hawaii doing the hoop trick with costumes in different scenery. It is impossible to get a workout and almost as impossible to do the trick she teaches you. In a workout dvd, you need to be able to do the move in order to get the workout. Basically, you would need to practice each move by yourself over and over before you could do it with the hoop on your hips in order to get a workout. In otherwords: its too hard to actually get a workout. I think the company just wanted to sell dvds to the fitness world and packaged them with these buzz words. I am frustrated and dissapointed.",1170979200,19,949,4.135135135135135
2750794,5,B000MX7KF8,"The clarity of the instructions for each move (including really helpful slow motion close-ups to amplify the important details), together with vivid imagery, offer real encouragement and make it all seem achievable.

This DVD offers so many moves to learn and the inclusion of choreographed combinations of moves is a real bonus. Anyone starting out with hooping can begin to see how to combine moves and transitions and really dance with their hoop.
