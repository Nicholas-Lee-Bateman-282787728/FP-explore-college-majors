3157114,2,B0016K76VE,"The Chilling (Deland Nuse and Jack A. Sunseri, 1989)

I will start off by saying that if the one-line synopsis ""Satanic cannibal zombies chasing Linda Blair through a cryogenics lab"" doesn't immediately tell you you need to see this movie, and the sooner the better, then I don't know you, and I don't wanna know you. I mean, that's the single best elevator pitch EVER. I grant you that the execution is nowhere near as good as the pitch would have you believe, but come on, man, it's Satanic cannibal zombies chasing Linda Blair through a cryogenics lab!

I actually don't even need to offer a plot synopsis, since (after thirty minutes of setup in which we are introduced to the characters in this movie that are actually alive--Blair, Dan Haggerty as a grizzled, pardon the pun, security guard, and Godfather II's Troy Donahue as the doctor who runs the operation are the three you need to know about) that sentence pretty much nails it. Which exposes the movie's main flaw immediately: there's really not much to it once you get to the possessed, rotting (why are they rotting? They were cryogenically preserved!), shambling guys, the filmmakers had another hour of celluloid to kill, which mostly consists of

[shot of shambling zombies with glowing eyes (because they're possessed! BY THE DEVIL!)]
[cut to one of the characters looking horrified]
[cut to zombie close-up]
[cut to character(s) running away]
[repeat ad nauseam]

still, you can't help but like Dan Haggerty in anything, and there's Linda Blair for the drool factor (okay, maybe it's just me, but I've had a crush on Linda Blair since I was six years old, SO SUE ME), and the zombie effects are so stupidly over-the-top that they have a charm all their own.

Note, from personal experience: this movie is definitely better watched while you're sitting at your computer playing Doom. More zombies per minute! **",1352937600,,1880,4.8625
3157115,5,B0016K76VE,"I recently have been on a Linda Blair kick and have watching her movies like they are going out of style.  She has this arcane quality about her presences, her performances are not going to win any awards yet I am totally captivated watching her.  So when I stumbled across the trailer/preview for ""The Chilling"" on another DVD I had rented I knew I needed to watch it.  First and foremost it had Ms. Blair, secondly it had zombies, thirdly it was made in the 1980s and fourthly I had no idea it existed.  Not to mention that this movie did for aluminum foil what Mr. Majestyk did for watermelons, more on this later...

The plot is a Dr. Miller (Troy Donahue) works in a cryogenic lab that freezes people so their illness can be cured at a later date.  Mary (Linda Blair) is a liaison (of sorts) who works with the clients.  The latest client Joseph (Jack De Ruiex) just lost his wife and son (Joe Jr), so to speak.  Therefore he has them ""put on ice"" in order to have their medical issues addressed at a later date.  Well to paraphrase a bit, all of the frozen people end up being brought back to life when the ""canisters"" the bodies are in is struck by lighting.

Now I must say that this is a different type of zombie movie.  If one goes in thinking they are going to see a Romero zombie movie or even something of ""The Walking Dead"" caliber, they will be disappointed.  As a mater of fact, the zombies themselves don't show up until the forty-five minute mark and this movie is only ninety minutes.  One might wonder if the zombies aren't in half of the movie then how is this movie so great.  Well my retort is the build up and circumstances that lead up to the zombie break out.  For instance, Joe Jr. was put on ice because he was injured in a bank robbery.  This bank robbery is so cheesy and over-the-top, I couldn't stop laughing.  When Mary shares with Joseph about her personal life and a ten second flashback is cued, I also couldn't stop laughing (and rewinding).  In addition, the dialogue is totally ludicrous and takes melodrama to a whole new level.

Digressing to the zombies, they almost look like aliens and make noises that resemble bugs or dragons.  Actually, I don't know what kind of noises they make but it isn't your normal zombie sounds.  These zombies also like to kill by choking their victims.  When these zombies were people and put in their canisters they were wrapped in aluminum foil.  Nevertheless when resurrection arrives, the zombies are now decked out in aluminum foil clothing....hysterical. If this all wasn't enough, you have Dan ""Grizzly Adams"" Haggerty playing a tough as nails security guard who aids in fighting off these undead abominations.

I have heard that Linda Blair walked off the set during production and that is why there are gaps without her.  I do not know how true that is, but never fear Ms. Blair is in this movie enough.  Not to mention the movie itself is so campy that I didn't really even notice the said ""gaps"".  Oh and the movie makers really wanted to promote that this movie was made in Kansas City, you will see references to it through out the movie.  In conclusion, if you want to see an amazing zombie movie or a great film for that matter, look elsewhere.  Yet if you are like me and have seen tons of B movies and enjoy unintentional humor then do yourself a favor and grab this gem.  I rented this flick and plan on adding it to my collection very, very soon.",1337558400,3,3438,4.437001594896332

Bad story, bad dialog, bad acting, bad makeup, bad special effects, bad editing, and bad ending.

It looks like they only had Linda Blair for half a day; the film is full of shots of a large person dressed like Linda Blair shot from the back, knees down, shoulders down, etc... just to fill in scenes they forgot to shoot when she was there.

3157117,5,B0016K76VE,"'The CHILLING' is FAR from being next to well-respected zombie flicks that have came out around its time, and even before its time.  But wait, 'The CHILLING' is FAR from being the worst Horror film, also.  The story itself is original and so are the zombies!  I know, I know, just because it happens to be original doesn't make it good.  In this case, it does!  There's five things I love about it.  First, let me be honest because I'm a sucker when it comes to my interests in cryogenics!!!  Any flick that revolves around cryogenics is most likely to be a winner with me.  Second, I like seeing Linda ('The Exorcist') Blair and my good 'ol boy Dan (""Grizzly Adams"") Haggerty starring together!  Third, within the first five minutes of this flick, it starts out CRAZY by showing us a murderous ""outlaw"" stabbing and shooting folks left and right!  Come on, the way those first few scenes in the beginning start off, is at least worth a two-star rating, in my opinion.  Fourth, the acting is not bad at all in considering that this film contains a bunch of no-names.  Seriously, I'm not saying it's oscar worthy but in a B-Horror such as this, I was impressed.  Lastly, fifth, the zombies shown in this film are acceptable.  Most may be a little over-the-top, as far as the traditional  zombie makeup goes (The dead are kept frozen right away for preservation, right? haha.), but I consider them to be THE Chud of zombie films.  Just like how 'C.H.U.D.' is a bit over exaggerated when showing its idea of what infection can do when exposed to chemical waste.

 I believe there are many other well-respected B-Horrors out there that are guilty for using this same formula.  So why so much hate for this little horror!???  It's nice NOT to see the same old zombie approach used or and over again.  Yes, these zombies do wear silvery space suits that look like something from a 50's creature feature film, but hey, their ""cryogenic suits"" remember! lol!  By the way, lightening just seems to make everything come to life. haha.  Check this flick out so you can see the AWESOME death scene involving a forklift!!!  -Cheers!",1264291200,6,2119,4.619302949061662
3157118,5,B0016K76VE,A Cryogenics company freezes the dead bodies of those who want to be re-incarnated in the future. Everything is going well until one night when a lightning storm zaps the containers holding the bodies and the corpses turn into zombies. The movie is great to laugh at and have a good time. It may be one of the worst movies of all time but its great to see zombies who kill people by breaking their necks. They are not flesh-eating zombies mind you. Dan Haggerty from The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams plays a world-weary security guard. The notorious Linda Blair is the lead actor. There is a man whose son is one of the zombies and he must either kill the boy or let him menace society. What will he decide to do? I love this movie. Its not great cinema but it definately has shlock-value. Enjoy!,1264118400,4,799,4.369127516778524
3157119,2,B0016K76VE,"Cool idea...bad movie.

ACTING:Wow...the lack of talent in this flick is amazing. Linda Blair can act. Dan Haggerty can act (even though he came awful close a few times to disproving that statement). Everyone else in this movie, bad. The characters in this movie are so blatantly stereotypical, and still couldn't be pulled off convincingly.

PRODUCTION: I f the movie was as good as the dvd cover is, it would have been great. The script is awful, the pacing and setting up of scenes is non-existent. Plus, due to Linda Blair coming to her senses and quiting this fiasco halfway through production, she all but vanishes from the screen and pops up in an already used clip. There are a few spots where this movie is creepy as Hell and some nifty blood and gore scenes.

ZOMBIES: Hmm...I just don't know...the zombies were blatant Halloween masks and wore suits of aluminum foil, but they seemed to work for me. Go figure. They are the typical shamblers, but really only to kill people by shaking the life out of them.

THE CAUSE: Lightning strike hitting cryogenic containers.

NUDITY: Yes.

FINAL: A zombie movie with a message...why does that seem so familiar to me? What could have been a creepy message movie is reduced to a cheesy mediocre mess of a nightmare. Linda Blair deserves much better. I hope she was paid a lot of money for this flick as the producers used her as ""bait"" to lure audiences in.

3157120,2,B0016K76VE,"(spoilers) I love horror movies. I love B-Movies as well. Nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies, monsters, murderers, that sort of thing. But to say that this movie was lacking, is an understatement. This movie was pure trash. You'd think the zombies would look somewhat like what the cover-art of the box displays, but instead, you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any Halloween display counter.

Furthermore, the script is beyond pitiful. Our main character, Joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the warm-hearted Mary, played by Blair. Not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of Joseph's character. Instead, we see the head of the cryogenic labs, a man named Dr. Miller, eager to get the dead bodies and experiment with their organs. There is no emotion or anything to make you believe you should give a damn about anyone in this film.

Once you see the cover art to this film of a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic chamber, you'll think you were in B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least that's the way I approached this film. But boy, was I in for a shock.  All and all, very disappointing. All the elements to make a great horror film were there. You had your zombies, your decent actors, and your story.

I liked it because I'm a fan of 80s horror, but it's one of those films that could've been a lot better. It seems that it was quickly written and made. There's some embalming stuff, and then you've got this scene with a guy getting his throat slashed and then a small heist shootout. Later, these  zombies come to life that are in canisters and just start chasing some people around in the dark at this one cryogenics place. It has some spots that some may think are a little slow, but I thought most of the film moves at a pretty good pace. The main problem with the movie is that many may not like the directing because it may seem amateurish and somewhat dull to many people. Even when they're being chased around by the zombies in that dark cryogenics area, the film doesn't have much effective atmosphere. The scenery is nothing worth mentioning, and it doesn't succeed with suspense either. The acting is also amateurish. Nudity is limited to a brief topless shot in a sex scene, and some may be disappointed in the films gore content. There's gore scattered throughout, but there's nothing extremely graphic or over-the-top; a zombie film like this one would've been so much better if they added some extreme gore, but this film has none. The zombies looked pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a really gory zombie movie. It says that this is the unrated director's cut, and I'm curious to know what exactly is different from the R-rated version. Despite its problems, I thought it had a nice 80s charm to it.  It also seems to improve with another viewing. I wanted more gore when I first saw it, but I was watching it at night again and had fun with it.

Lots of good extras on the DVD. They are Outtakes, Behind the Scenes, Extended Promo Trailer, Original Trailer, Stills Gallery, and a bunch of Shriek Show trailers. The best one is the Outtakes extra. This shows a lengthy shower sex sequence that was never even in the film. It has both a guy and a girl fully nude; although with the exception of the quick part in the beginning before they get into the shower, the rest of the scene is basically filmed through the shower door that gets kind of foggy. I don't know why they decided to take this out of the film because most people who are buying this want exploitation. The DVD quality has colors that could've been a little better and contrast needs some improvement,  but brightness and sharpness are good. Overall, it's a nice transfer. It was released by Code Red and Shriek Show, and Code Red has this on their site as being OOP. I got a new copy for a really cheap price, so it was worth it.",1395360000,3,2760,4.470238095238095

8262754,3,B0016K76VE,"Just to be upfront about this film, I got it because it has Linda Blair in it.  That being said, it is only a 3.3 rating on IMDb.  If you are anywhere close to being as old as I am then you most likely remember Troy Donahue and that in and of itself takes points away from this movie, but it also has Dan Haggerty, so it gets a few points back.  The rest of the cast is just O.K., so on with the movie.
The bodies at a cryogenic storage center are being defrosted by accident and turning into cannibalistic zombies.  Oh, did I mention, Linda Blair is in the movie?  Well, you get the idea.  If you are like me and a huge Linda Blair fan, then you need this to help complete your collection, otherwise, it depends on just how much you like B horror movies.",1377302400,,755,4.033557046979865
8262755,5,B0016K76VE,"Here's another awesome horror movie that I highly recomment to all of you horror fans out there. This one is in the spirit of night of the living dead if you liked that movie. Just imagine being frozen in a cryogentic freezer for about ten years and someone came along and thawed you out ten years like a TV dinner. That's basically what this movie has to offer. I know you say, ''That's sick!'' Well you're right, however its awesome to me and cool at the same time! Take from me its worth it to buy or watch this movie. It will scare you to death!!!",1359676800,,551,4.2075471698113205
