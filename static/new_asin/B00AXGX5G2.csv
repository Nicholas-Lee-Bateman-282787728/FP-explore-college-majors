Besides the censorship, the video quality of the remaining 82 minutes is hideous and the 4:3 picture format has been achieved by simply cropping the frame, leaving only the very center of the original picture.  The result is that you often can see only pieces of the characters and sometimes not even that.

This Desert Island Films product is a rip-off and is misleadingly advertised.  Avoid like the plague!",1529366400,,659,4.4789915966386555
