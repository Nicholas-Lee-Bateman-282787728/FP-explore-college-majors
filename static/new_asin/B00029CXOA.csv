8167995,5,B00029CXOA,"Great DVD with recordings from performing artists from 1970 to 1973.
Some of the video's are quite unique, especially Rod McKuen in a Dutch television show from 1971.
Rod McKuen and Demis Roussos are in black & white, the rest is in color. Good quality.
An entertaining collection. I enjoyed it very much.",1383782400,,305,4.773584905660377
8167996,1,B00029CXOA,"Oh,my, very disappointing. There I was waiting with baited breath for my dvd to arrive so I could really enjoy a look back to a time when music was really great to listen to, when there were no videos/dvds etc. all we had to listen to was radio. The feeling I got when I opened the dvd was just ""truly let down"". There were acts on the dvd that even I had never heard of & I'm well into my 40's. I don't recommend that anyone buy this dvd or any others in the Remember the 70's collection because you may only recognise a couple of songs as I did. Maybe dvds such as these compilations should have a track list as part of the info about them so that then us little people who pay the money as well as the freight and who live overseas in the outback of Australia can then choose whether we purchase the dvds or not. I bought these on the strength of them simply being 70's dvds as there are very few around, so all I had to go on was the covershot on the website, but the people who put these compilations together obviously did not live in the 70's or they would have chosen better material to put on the dvd. I thought I was getting a real blast from the past, but alas it was not to meant to be. And as I said, living in the outback of Australia, there isn't much available in the way of good music unless you order from places overseas. Rather than send them back I will keep them to constantly remind myself that even an intelligent person can be sucked into buying something that just was not worth the money I paid.",1211673600,,1522,4.093645484949833
