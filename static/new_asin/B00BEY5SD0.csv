8567348,5,B00BEY5SD0,"As I continue to add to my Catholic DVD collection, this recent addition was not disappointing. After viewing this 1 hour forum, I walked away feeling enlightened and more appreciative about the Mass. It is true so many Catholics take this ceremony and liturgy for granted. This DVD offers an overview into all parts of the Mass; it's meaning and how it is set up as a form of worship and as a way of Christ communicating with us as we join together with him in thankfulness for all he has graciously done and continues to do for us. After all, we are in constant need of atonement for our sins.
The only criticism I have for the program is the way the interviews with the various apologist was set up. While each of them is explaining the portion of the mass, there is noise always going on in the background. I assume it is an actual mass going on in the chapel. Was this designed to enhance the learning experience? The realism? If so, I would have to say I think the idea falls very flat and proves to be more of a distraction than an enhancement of the viewing experience. Still, like all apologist work, i would recommend this DVD to all Catholics both new and cradle alike. Nice work gentlemen!",1387238400,3,1201,4.390134529147982
