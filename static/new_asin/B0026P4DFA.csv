3855669,5,B0026P4DFA,The music is catchy and my little ones (under 4) dance to it every morning.  Well worth the money.,1289865600,13,98,4.157894736842105
3855670,5,B0026P4DFA,"My daughter absolutely loves this video, and I feel good about the exercise she is getting while enjoying herself. Definitely worth the price.",1273622400,4,142,5.217391304347826
3855681,5,B0026P4DFA,"I have several little ones and I also run a daycare. We all love Baby Dance and Zoey's Dance Moves and this Time for Dancing Preschool Dance Experience was recommended to us. The price for this digital copy was nothing to argue with and the kiddos love it! It took a couple of times watching it to really get the hang of their dance moves but now my kids (2 year old twins, 3 year old and 4 year old twins) have the moves down pat! This keeps my kids occupied while I have a few minutes to tend to the baby and it gives them exercise. I also like that this has dance moves that help them with their coordination and balance and that each child can do it in their own space rather than fight over space in our living room! I highly recommend this to all parents with young kiddos!",1465430400,3,779,4.098039215686274
3855682,5,B0026P4DFA,"This is a low budget dance video for tots, but my daughter LOVES IT!!!! Her love for the songs and dances forgives all the cheap production and poor audio. It's a good time and fro 6 bucks you can't beat it. A great way to get your little one active on a rainy day or any day!!",1461715200,,277,3.8771929824561404

3855684,1,B0026P4DFA,"Extremely overpriced. Not even worse $5. Hard to follow. Shows faces like home video.  Bet it was made for advertising purposes. Poor video quality. Wonder if most of those good reviews were written by the parents of those kids. aBefore buying, read all the bad reviews. So true. Will try to return.",1455321600,,299,4.75
3855685,5,B0026P4DFA,I have been looking for a good dance video for small beginners for a while.  My two year old daughter dances everytime she hears music.  When I saw her mimicking the Penguins dance in a movie I decided I really need to find her something.  This is perfect. Both of My two year olds love this.  I think it's day three of watching and my daughter already tries to follow along .  This has good music and great voices.  This is not one of those irritating videos you wish your child didn't like.  During the tippy toe dance we all walk on our toes.  This is fun and easy for adults and toddlers .  My son who is also two loves it but he's not as much into dancing as his sister.,1454371200,3,675,4.053030303030303
3855686,1,B0026P4DFA,"Avoid this DVD. The video is not easy for kids to follow - the shots move around all over the place and you can't see what the presenters are doing to copy. I wasn't expecting a dance instruction DVD given that it's for preschoolers, just a bit of fun, but I expected more than this.

Some tracks are basically music videos by kids and again, not very well designed for kids wanting to join in. The music is actually pretty bad.

My 3 year old daughter loves dancing but won't dance to this, or even watch it.

Sorry I can't recommend a better option in its place as this is the first kid's dance DVD that I've tried. I'm bit scared to try any more after this experience...",1445472000,,673,4.2421875

3855689,3,B0026P4DFA,My three year old daughter really enjoyed this dvd. But I wish there was a list of props needed. It wasn't fun scrounging around trying to find the props the instructor and the kids the video were using as the songs were playing.,1431129600,,229,4.348837209302325
3855690,4,B0026P4DFA,"daughter is in tumbling and wanted to see if she was interested in dance as well, and even now I don't know what she thinks about dance but she does like how this video flows",1423612800,,174,4.0
3855701,2,B0026P4DFA,DVD is ok.  It has some cute songs but didn't keep my daughters attention.  It was not for a 2 year old.,1423008000,,104,3.6818181818181817
3855702,2,B0026P4DFA,"My 3.5 year old takes ballet/tap class and thought this would be fun on a snow day.  While she loved it because she loves dance there are problems with it

1. Poor video quality blurry
2.  Poor production- often we couldn't figure what she was supposed to be doing because they were focused on distracted kids or the props instead of the dance
3.  Parts require a partner....my daughter's an only so we have to step in which is fun but would be great if she could do it without needing us
4. Kids singing the songs - while cute won't be on repeat in our house

Kids are cute and my daughter responded well to it but will keep looking...loved the rent option!",1422316800,,658,4.274193548387097
3855703,5,B0026P4DFA,there is nothing more enjoyable than watching my daughter dance and laugh and play along with this video. She makes me do it with her which I'm sure is funny to watch from the fly on the walls perspective.,1420070400,,205,4.282051282051282
3855704,1,B0026P4DFA,"The Amazon Quality was terrible!!!! The image is blurry and grainy... we stream tons of things through amazon and this was the first time we had this issue. Do not purchase,the video quality is outrageous. Can barely see the video!",1416355200,,231,4.8
3855705,3,B0026P4DFA,"My 4 YO daughter loves this video.  In some of the songs, the girls have their midriffs showing and I don't care for that, so I have to tell my daughter, ""we don't dress like that.""  Produced in NZ so kids and narrator have an accent, but my daughter didn't seem to mind.",1416355200,3,271,4.09433962264151

3855708,2,B0026P4DFA,there is too much focus on the child singer and not her movements.  It's not real easy to follow because the video tends to focus on faces more than hands and feet.,1404172800,,164,4.125
3855709,4,B0026P4DFA,"Like it says, it is for Preschool toddlers. I would say it is for 3+ age at least. However, my 2yr old likes it :)",1396396800,,114,3.6
3855710,5,B0026P4DFA,i HOPE THIS GROUP WITH PRODUCE MORE.  Our three year old grand daughter is always picking this one foirst and over and over and can follow along. Good props,1389225600,,156,4.379310344827586
3855721,1,B0026P4DFA,"I was not expecting how little ""dance"" the video actually had. It thought there would still be some real dance/ballet movements just without the technical names, but I was wrong. There is no verbal instruction from the teacher AT ALL. The DVD just expects the kids to watch multiple views and screens and pick it up from there. The ""dance movements"" involved things like waving around hands or jumping for an entire song.  I think it was TOO simple and I think this will be boring after more viewings.
I also do not like how nearly every song used props.  My poor three year old was frantic that she did not have the props in the video, which included ribbons, helium balloons, basketball, large rubber bands, and a musical instrument. I did not realize that props would be needed for the dances. Who has helium-filled balloons lying around? This is annoying and distracted from the dance movements.
I also did not like that the video is narrated by a British child. I thought this was an American DVD since it was purchased from Amazon, and I do not like the accent which is hard for my daughter to understand.
The video is very low budget, which I was expecting. The picture and sound quality is bad.  But I hate how it also zoomed out sometimes to feature a triple screen with black bands on top and bottom. On our large flat screen, the picture was small, and it was difficult for my daughter to know which screen to follow.
We own Moove & Groove kids, which I like much better, but I am still trying to find a good dance video that is on par with the dance class instruction she receives.  I would like something for her to use at home to practice and get exercise.
I WISH I COULD RETURN THIS DVD!!  NOT RECOMMENDED!",1388966400,5,1721,4.4335443037974684

3855723,4,B0026P4DFA,"Browsing for something different for my 2 year old [at the time] granddaughter for Christmas, I purchased Time for Dance Video.  Initially, she didn't seem impressed, I wrote it off as money not well spent.  It appears to have grown on her, as currently months later she has all dances memorized and is now memorizing the songs!!!  I'd say this is great entertainment for the kids, as they are not just sitting watching movies,,,but Great Entertainment for parents and grandparents,, Their Audience!  :)",1376179200,2,503,5.024096385542169
3855724,5,B0026P4DFA,We got this for my daughter's third birthday and she loves it. She loves watching and dancing with it. Cute dances and great for the age group. I think it works great to help her be more agile. I would totally recommend it.,1372464000,3,223,4.209302325581396

3855729,4,B0026P4DFA,"I purchased this because the first one I bought for her was too advanced and though it said there were children in the video, they were much older than her age group. Ever since the first time she watched it, she hasn't stopped asking if we can put in her balerina movie.

As a parent a couple of the songs are a little annoying but it still gets 5 stars because my daughter loves it. Would probably be great for a kid that's too shy for dance class at this age.  My daughter is also in a dance class... has been to 2 classes so far and loves it. I bet this movie helps with her confidence there.",1347840000,3,445,4.056818181818182
3855743,5,B0026P4DFA,"When the video arrived I was skeptical, my 2 year old daughter watched it several times without moving or imitating anything, it doesn't have too much of a ""lesson"" feeling, it is more like songs and kids enjoying. But after a few days she started to dance and even sing the songs and just this past weekend she danced the whole DVD in front of the camera for her grand parents abroad, she loves it and it is very good for her age, now I see in what parts it shows kids how to mimic some movements.
I Would say that is DVD is for little children like my daughter.",1328486400,2,563,4.127272727272727
3855744,5,B0026P4DFA,"I bought this for my 2.5 year old for Christmas along with a ballerina outfit and she loves it.  Some (many) of the moves are too complex for her age group but who cares- she likes watching the kids and doing her best to dance and sing along.  The video is broken up into short segments, each only a few minutes long, so your kid can do a few at a time or watch the whole way through.  The different segments also help to break it up for me- I don't have to sit and hear the same character drone on and on for 1/2 an hour like most childrens programming.  I can see this video being fun for lots of different ages, and my daughter is up and moving the whole time she watches it.  If she wants to watch tv, I'd rather see her jump around and get some exercise than sit and stare at a cartoon any day!",1325808000,,799,3.937888198757764

3855746,4,B0026P4DFA,"This video has great music and the songs are sung by children.  I actually enjoy listening to the music.  A group of toddlers and young children are shown dancing to a variety of types of music - everything from hip hop to ballet.  I like the fact that they are dressed appropriately - cute but not  ""adult-like"" outfits.  One thing that surprised me is that they all have a British or Australian accent.  It is kinda neat though.  This is a fun DVD for a young child who just wants to move to the music and vaguely imitate the moves shown.  There is little instruction so this is certainly not a formal dance lesson DVD.",1297036800,9,621,4.339130434782609

I was hoping for an instructional DVD that would teach dance, incorporate different steps and move progressively.

The level of dance is babyish on some dances and quite advanced on other dances.  The editing is poor, focusing on head shots and upper body on some dances.  On one dance, a young girl does a version of the dance, then the instructor says she (and class) will teach you the same dance, but it is NOT exactly the same.  Frustrating for child.
