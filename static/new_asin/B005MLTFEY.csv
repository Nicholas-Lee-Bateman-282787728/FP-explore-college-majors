8479476,4,B005MLTFEY,I've been searching for this movie since I watched it when I was in 5th or 6th grade. I remember it vividly and wanted to watch it again. Here I have it now and I enjoyed watching it again. Thanks.,1421539200,,197,3.95
8479477,1,B005MLTFEY,"Absolutely NO GO! The movie was shot in Cinemascope. This DVD is 4:3 Pan & Scan!!! (In any scenes the actors are outside of the Frame).
Dirk Borgarde is hot in his black leather pants!

DVD is Code 2, PAL, from Germany. Contains german and original english Soundtrack.",1317427200,,268,4.583333333333333
8479478,2,B005MLTFEY,"Careful! This film was not shot 1:33 as presented on this disc! It was shot in CinemaScope! There's a tremendous difference between a 1:33, panned and scanned presentation and the original aspect ratio!

Besides, it's a British film in what appears to be a German version here. It would be bad enough to have German subtitles in a squeezed, P&S print, but one wouldn't want Mills and Bogarde DUBBED with English titles either!

Additionally, the running time indicated on this version is, I believe, inaccurate. It is definitely longer than 117 minutes.

Though it has developed a cult following over the years, the film was badly received originally, which probably explains why it has never been commercially released IN English and IN the correct aspect ratio.",1187913600,7,763,5.0396825396825395
8479479,4,B005MLTFEY,"i originally saw ""the singer, not the song"" in an art theater during the summer of 1960. the film impressed me so much i can still remember most of it today. the only reason i did not rate the film 5 stars is british actors do not play mexicans well. but, the script and acting were superb. the film's message is what will haunt your mind, especially if you attend church regularly.",1151971200,8,382,4.319444444444445
