This every motion and prop she used, it was as you saw, felt, and lived in that moment of Polly's journey through life.  I found it to be heart warming and inspiring.  I can't wait to watch it again.  I would recommend this video to everyone and it is something to enjoy with the whole family.",1312675200,,356,4.430769230769231
