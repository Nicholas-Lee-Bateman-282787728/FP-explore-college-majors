7862105,2,6304067879,"This tape contains the third and fourth episodes of ""WMAC Masters,"" the only kids' show from the 90s I know of which presented the martial arts without the additions of morphing and monsters. The show was still developing itself and it shows, making this my least favorite cassette of the three that were released in North America. The two episodes on here still contain some quality stuff, but the presentation of a lot of its material is sloppy, giving the impression the producers were trying to cram as much into these episodes and not allowing a proper story to be told.

The ""Going for Gold"" episode is overall the worst episode of the show I've seen thus far. Its dramatized story section (in which Herb ""Olympus"" Perez and Erik ""Panther"" Betts&nbsp;] teach a lesson to an arrogant school bully in flashback) is as corny as usual, but if you like the show you won't mind. The eventual showdown between Perez and Michael ""Turbo"" Bernardo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shootfighter/dp/B00005UWOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shootfighter</a>) is also decent, albeit plagued by constant ninja interference. What really bugs me is that the episode presents three matches from the separate women's tournament but in abridged format: you only see thrown-together clips of Mer-Mer ""Princess"" Chen vs. Christine ""Lady Lightning"" Rodriguez (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xtreme-Fighter/dp/B0007Z0OOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xtreme Fighter</a>), Bridget ""Baby Doll"" Riley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Triple-Impact/dp/6302765005/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Triple Impact</a>) vs. Michelle ""Mouse"" Krasnoo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer-4/dp/B0000ALPFJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer 4</a>), and Rodriguez vs. Riley. What the heck? Who thought we wouldn't want to see these fights in their entirety?

""Broken Promise"" is a better episode, if only for featuring more full matches. The dramatized falling out between Jamie ""Great Wolf"" Webster and Johnny Lee ""Tiger Claw"" Smith also isn't as easily resolved as other moral-related problems the Masters face on the show - heck, they *don't* even resolve it, at least not on this episode. Fight-wise, the flashbacked tournament fight between those two and the finale between Webster and Chris ""Red Dragon"" Casamassa (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>) are both pretty good, but the standout match of the show is the Casamassa vs. Hien ""Tsunami"" Nguyen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Steel/dp/6303025625/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Steel</a>) showdown is easily the best match the series had presented at that point; I wish that one could've been filmed for a movie.

The disappointment of the former episode weighs heavily on the decent of the latter, leading to an eventual low rating. ""Going for Gold"" was just too much of a missed opportunity, and ""Broken Promise"" isn't so good that it makes up for it. If you're a collector, go ahead and pick this up, but other viewers can definitely start with one of the other tapes.",1358467200,,3309,6.448198198198198
7862106,3,6304067879,"(Amazon.com has apparently synched the review pages for the ""Meet the Masters/Brothers in Arms"" and the ""Ninja Challenge/Quest for the Dragon Star"" tapes. This review is for the former)

What with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers/dp/B008XRE81E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</a>&nbsp;and its copycats hogging the time slots at the time of their airing and subsequently the nostalgic memories of most kids at the time, it's not all that surprising that so few folks remember ""WMAC Masters."" Nevertheless, it's a bit of a shame, since none of the other shows that featured martial arts actually considered them as actual disciplines or even emphasized their utilization over explosions and rubber monster costumes. Yes, for all its corniness, ""WMAC Masters"" was a show for kids who could dig the martial arts for both their beauty and coolness, as well as the legitimate masters of them. This tape here is comprised of the first two episodes of the show, which do a pretty good job of preparing you for the rest of the series.

The show revolves around a fictional tournament in which charismatic martial arts masters compete in specialized matches in pursuit of the ultimate prize - the Dragon Star. I forget what the significance of the Dragon Star is, but while all of these fighters want it, they don't kill en-route to obtaining it - it's a kid's show, after all. And like a good number of kid's shows, ""WMAC Masters"" stresses life lessons and morals via dramatized backstage vignettes and flashbacks. These are easily the weakest part of the show if you're watching it uncompromisingly, because even though a lot of the performers have acted in films, none of them you'll see here are particularly good actors.

The full cast of the show comprised about two dozen fighters, but the ones prominently featured in these two episodes are Hakim Alston and Chris Casamassa (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>), Ho-Sung Pak (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Drunken-Master/dp/B004U7MR1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Drunken Master</a>) and Ho-Young Pak (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Book-Of-Swords/dp/B004AODXWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Book Of Swords</a>), Jamie Webster, Herb Perez, and ""Power Rangers"" alumnus Hien Nguyen. They engage in two types of matches: ""regular"" exchanges wherein both performers first take on groups of ninjas or ""kabuki warriors"" before engaging in one-on-one competition, and the finale match of the episode wherein the two finalists battle in a cage with the goal of not touching the fenced walls. The former match features a kind of ""life bar"" for both performers like a video game, and the winner of the latter type of match is determined by an accumulation of points. If you ask me, these types of setups are a needlessly complicated when straight one-on-one fights would have sufficed for any situation, but oh well - that's just what it is.

It ought to interest fans of martial arts movies in general that the entire series was directed by Isaac Florentine, the filmmaker who's dedicated almost his entire career to karate flicks and would gain cult acclaim with features like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II-Last-Man-Standing/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II - Last Man Standing</a>. While Florentine was still years away from his peak, his style of action filmmaking is clear and apparent here: not the least bit conservative, every fight your see here is full of jumps, flips, spin kicks, and light-fast choreography in general. The fights might as well have counted as audition tapes for whomever was involved. With that said, not every brawl is good: altogether there are nine fights and at least two of them (Alston vs. Webster and Nguyen vs. Perez) are disappointingly filmed and awkwardly staged, respectively. Overall, though, the individual matches are worth the (reasonable) price of purchase.

While this show is most likely not going to appeal to all adult viewers, kids who like action TV and don't mind the lack of colorful helmets should enjoy this for its uniqueness, if their parents are game to the violence. The fact that it approaches martial arts with a sportsmanlike attitude should not be overlooked. Personally, I'm holding out for a future DVD release, but until then, I'm going to be fine with tapes like these.",1358294400,,4661,5.85861561119293

I'm still looking for the rest of the episodes to come out to my this episode complete. This is my ONLY reason for not giving it 5 stars,sorry.",1091404800,,439,4.057471264367816
