4734892,3,B005LAIH9A,"American Pie 1, 2, and 3 I couldn't finish because they were so corny, fake and overly dramatic making sex a big deal plus very anti-jock. This one at least I could finish the because the characters were more believable and more human. It was ok. Music sucked. Good choice on going with a new director. Bravo on going with a girl with a natural body this time. Huh, ironic?",1507334400,,373,4.3428571428571425

4734896,5,B005LAIH9A,"It gets the high rating for the nostalgia of it being an original AP series sequel AND for letting us join the characters as they joke about the era of the original trilogy.

4734899,5,B005LAIH9A,"American Pie never gets old to me.  It's a nice twist and great ending on the already existing and non-ending franchise however this is the original.  Original cast and plays great homage to their high hijinks days and now their later in the early life goings on and yes, you guessed it, still getting themselves into all kinds of trouble both fun and otherwise.  This is another one for the DVD library especially if you already own the other American Pie franchise movies!",1490400000,,474,4.686746987951807

4734987,4,B005LAIH9A,I think this was an excellent conclusion to a long running series. It was nice to see the full cast back together and the comedy was a good as any of the other movies in the series in my opinion.,1474675200,,195,3.9

4735090,3,B005LAIH9A,It was great to see the gang back together again but something seemed flat. I wanted to love it more since these movies were pivotal in my childhood. I would happily watch 50 more of these movies though.,1472515200,,203,4.368421052631579

4735308,4,B005LAIH9A,"Way better than it is given credit for. Aside from Oz, which was disappointing, and Stifler, which is an important theme of the series, everyone has actually evolved. Yes, the humor around Jim is slapstick, but is different from the foibles of their teen  years. Ali Cobrin (latest on the ""I can't decide if I want her/want to be her"" list) is fun adding a new dynamic to the crew.",1466467200,,381,4.442857142857143

4735386,5,B005LAIH9A,Digitally i could get a copy on itunes and VUDU. This studio is doing the right thing that allows me to watch the movie and not have to juggle 600 apps on where i need to watch the movie.  If i own the movie i should also receive a digital copy on any provider i want similar to disney movies anywhere for all studios.  If I am shelling out 15-25 a movie when everyone else is stealing them digitally I should be rewarded for it.,1458950400,,429,4.035294117647059

4735615,1,B005LAIH9A,"We didn't actually finish this movie.  The first one was hilarious, but this one was forced and painful to watch.  In a movie so full of great comedic actors, it seems like this was just a waste of time and talent.",1443657600,,214,4.195121951219512
4735616,3,B005LAIH9A,"When I first saw this film, I thought it was amazing, but as I've rewatched it, I start to not laugh much at all. I very much love American Wedding out of all the American Pie movies, even the first, so when this came out, I expected not to like it as much. It has some very flat jokes, and some very crude and stupid ones too. Seeing Oz get grinded on by a fat soccer  mom is not my idea of funny. Seeing Jim bust himself all over the internet and get completely embarrassed is hysterical.. It never really kept a tone either.. like is it a REUNION movie?? Is it a funny over-the-top crude and rude weekend with the boys?? OR is it a romantic getaway turned sour? We never get a balance of one tone, but a mix that truly doesn't work as well as American Wedding did. There are some extremely funny bits in this movie and some very good ""performances"", but overall, meh. Yeah. Meh. I liked the trailer more.",1443571200,,907,4.182857142857143

4735782,2,B005LAIH9A,"The writers did a few clever things that were very funny, particularly with Eugene Levy. And amazingly, the guys look the same now as they did 15 years earlier (only Kevin's sporting facial hair and Heather's a blonde.)  They should have had Stifler grow up more - most of Seann Scott's scenes were just kinda pathetic.  Good that they gave Jennifer Coolidge a bigger part in this film, she deserved it.  I wished they'd written better parts for the MILF guys - they gave John Cho a decent part but the other MILF dude (Justin Isfeld) had only a mere few seconds.  But...this film was definitely better than ""American Wedding"", so if this is the last one they do, they I'd say they closed things out decently.",1436400000,,709,4.559055118110236

4735897,4,B005LAIH9A,"While it's often fun to think ""what would come next?"" in reference to movie characters we love, this film was unnecessary (as expected).

The original cast rejoins the war with Jim, Michelle, Stifler, and their friends reuniting in East Great Falls, Michigan for their high school reunion.

What did I think?

Now theres an EIGHTH movie in the series. On the bright side, its the best since the original movie but lets face it: thats not really saying much given the quality of numbers two through seven.

Diehard fans will enjoy the characterizations and misadventures, but most of us have seen it all before. Too many times.",1431561600,,505,4.7701149425287355

4736503,5,B005LAIH9A,"The fourth installment of the influential gross-out franchise arrives a distant nine years after the mediocre American Wedding, which followed two years after the even-more excruciating American Pie 2. A funny, character-driven film can quickly and easily become an obnoxious caricature of itself in sequels, and American Wedding likely left most viewers, including fans of the original American Pie, grumbling, ""If I never see these jokers again, it will be too soon.""

What a pleasant surprise, then, that American Reunion turns out to be such a funny and unexpectedly emotionally satisfying trip back to East Great Fall, Michigan, the small town that started it all for a group of teenage guys just, like many young onscreen horn-dogs before them, looking to get laid. Returning thirteen years later for their high school reunion, none of the old gang enjoys the happy life they imagined in the senior high school yearbook. New dad Jim longed to have the sex life of-oops-Ricky Martin but instead, similar to other 2012 cinematic marital challenges in Friends with Kids and Hope Springs, finds himself in a sexual rut with his wife Michelle. Oz imagined having a family; instead he hosts an off-brand sports show, lost to Gilbert Gottfried in a celebrity dance competition and can barely keep up with his adventurous model-girlfriend, whose hotness is now obscured by her personality Kevin imagined happiness with Vicky; now he mostly feels emasculated by his and his wife's TV-watching habits. Stifler rarely hangs out with the boys, working as a temp and suffering the insults he prefers to dole out himself. Only world-traveled Finch has made his dreams a reality, though no one can corroborate his stories and he has yet to find the great love he seeks.

That is an effective place to start, particularly for a movie whose previous installment included, Stifler having sex with Jim's grandma. In the hands of Harold and Kumar writers/directors Jon Hurwiz and Hayden Schlossberg, America Reunion again becomes a casual and frequently very funny tour of the shenanigans that guys get themselves into and out of. The film does feature a few especially, uh, vivid images, such a pubic hair and vaginal secretions on Stifler's face after he goes down on an old classmate long overdue for some sexual reciprocation. However, Hurwitz and Schlossberg are not nearly as crass as the relative no-names who helmed the last two American movies. American Reunion coasts on a laid-back vibe along which some familiar faces glide in and out. The experience of returning to a hometown and reverting back to childish ways with old friends seems as inevitable as the reunion itself.

That is not to say that the film does not offer several of the expected, over-the-top set pieces. After all, Jim still gets himself into a sticky situation, sometimes literally, every few hours, and he is caught absolutely every time. Whether he is trying to masturbate while his wife is taking a a bath or spend time with Kara, the girl next door for whom he used to baby-sit but who is now turning eighteen and ready for more adult activities, Jim seems to have an irresistible spell on him that taunts, ""Yes, the last fifty times things have turned out awkwardly and embarrassing, but, hey, this could be fun, right?""

Yes part of what makes American Reunion rewarding is that the physical humor exists not just for the sake of a laugh/groan but to support a story about guys in their early thirties trying to reconcile their place in the world with their own expectations and perceptions. Among the errors: Oz's friends assume he must love having such a gorgeous girlfriend. Jim's friends assume he's having more sex than any of them. Kevin is happily married but cannot deny the feelings that are activated when he sees Vicky, who will always be his first love. Finch reconnects with a former classmate who has become stunningly beautiful but still cannot come clean about his current routine. Even Jim's dad, now a widower, feels dissatisfied, so Jim tries to help his dad get back into the dating game.

This dose of adult melancholy suits these characters well and usefully modulates the outrageous behavior the ensues. Fortunately, most of it delivers the laughs. Hurwitz and Schlossberg include plenty of amusing visual gags, like Jim hiding links to his favorite Internet porn sites behind a bookmark labeled, ""Boring work stuff,"" or funny exchanges like, after Stifler retaliates in traditionally extreme fashion against a bunch of high school punks, Kevin says, ""You trashed their jetskis."" ""They splashed us, so..."" responds Stifler, who, in Sean William Scott's performance that finds charm and vulnerability beneath the outer jerk, seems to recognize that this is one of many times that he has gone too far.

That of course, is part of growing up, and a lesson that each guy learns in different ways in American Reunion. Yet these friends never stab each other in the back. They are there is a drunk, topless eighteen-year-old needs to be snuck back into her parents' house. They are there is one of the guys stands outside in leather shorts and suspenders while facing a beat-down from a high-school kid. And they are there if an ex's current flame-in this case, it's the cardiologist boyfriend of Oz's ex, Heather-needs to be put in his place. Rather than lamenting where they are, Jim and his pals discover how to reevaluate and enjoy being there together.

That feels so much truer and warmer than so many R-rated comedies, especially those starring Adam Sandler, which revolve around malicious deception and make light of various forms of insensitivity. In American Reunion, the heroes mean well, and Stifler's idiocy only makes him look like someone with a lot of issues to work on. Clearly, being thirty-one does not automatically equal being thirteen years wiser and more mature than eighteen. Says Jessica to Kevin at the reunion, ""Be a real man; you have a beard now."" If only it were that easy.",1407283200,,5994,4.970089730807577

4736674,2,B005LAIH9A,"The fallout from the original American Pie  a still-cresting tidal wave of tedious adolescent grossout crud  has obscured the fact that it was a likeable little comedy filled with memorable characters and moments of insight into the teenage condition. Thirteen years later, those characters have grown up  but the movies havent. American Reunion sees Jim (Jason Biggs), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and their toddler head home for a high-school reunion party, inevitably hooking up with the entire cast of the original movie en route. But what could have been a sweet, nostalgic reflection on the pitfalls and pleasures of growing up  with added dick jokes  is let down by a feeble script.
Being about a high-school reunion, the most sacred of all rites in US public life, the movie unravels into sentimentality and self-congratulation (Jim and Michelle happily going at it again in the school music room; even Stifler embraced  Youre a fun dick and you're our  dick).

4736960,4,B005LAIH9A,"American Reunion is exactly what the films title means: reunion of the characters of the American Pie series. They are older and just a little wiser, but the jokes, mostly sex-related, remain the same, with Jason Biggs doing the famous pie joke in a totally different way. And that is a good thing after all because that is what we want from the series.

So, all the principal characters come back, with Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), now happily married. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is also married, but Oz (Chris Klein), now a LA sportscaster, is not. Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas) seems to have been travelling around the world and as to Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), well, he never changes. Tara Reid and Mena Suvari also return, but their roles are not very big. Natasha Lyonne appears only in one scene.

Its good to see Eugene Levy as Jims father and Jennifer Coolidge as Stiflers mother sharing the screen for the first time together. You will also meet other cast members including John Cho, Shannon Elizabeth and Chris Owen.

The latest installment refuses to slow down, with silly jokes that are almost as effective as those in the original released back in 1999. Directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, the film, though no longer refreshing, still knows what it is doing: a gross-out comedy with sweet nostalgia. And as such it works.",1384819200,,1375,4.817796610169491
4736961,3,B005LAIH9A,"I thought the movie was pretty good. My complaint refers to the regular version, as that is the one I saw. For some strange reason it seems that every other R-Rated comedy feels compelled to graphically show the penis. Not just a fleeting glimpse but rather an extended perfectly lit close-up, as in this film. I have no problem with this, except that this level of nudity is NEVER done with females.

With women, whenever there is a frontal nude scene the crotch area will always be censored with a merkin (fake pubic hair). Yet when it comes to males, the audience is treated to graphic shots of total non obstructed male genitals. Just watch this film, or Hall Pass, or Bruno, or shows like Spartacus.

Just once it would be nice to see some female nudity on the same level as the male nudity. Can anyone imagine a mainstream R-Rated movie having a scene where the camera zooms in for an extended close-up of a woman's totally shaved vagina. It would never happen. Yet that level of nudity for males is not uncommon. Just watch this film (regular version).

It seems that the basic rule of thumb for your typical raunchy R-rated film is that the female nudity will be limited to just breasts, but the male nudity will include multiple graphic shots of actual genitals. It is an extremely bizarre double standard, and one that really should end.",1383177600,,1347,4.604166666666667

Anyway...I don't doubt that there could be a fifth movie maybe focused on parenting or something awkward that would absolutely make a killing with these guys...maybe Jim and Michelle have a teen daughter that falls in love with Stifler's teen son or the other way around or maybe that their kids are homosexual and a daughter likes a daughter or son likes a son or something!

4737179,5,B005LAIH9A,"When I first went to the movie theater to see this movie, I was afraid that it would be terrible. The reason why I thought it would be bad was that in the first three American Pies, they are all young and those movies were about the time in your life when sex was a major part of your life. When you get older and have kids, (like they did), your not that raunchy. I was SO glad I was wrong. It was hilarious! The characters have kind of changed, but not too much. The basic premise of this is the gang heads back to their hometown for their 13th year anniversary. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but it is a very funny movie, and I would highly recommend it. If you haven't seen any other of the American Pie movies (not the s****y spin-offs) you may be confused on some of the jokes.

American pie came out when I was in high school, the second movie based when they were in college came out when I was in college. You get the idea. I feel like I grew up with these movies and characters. My boyfriend was completely shocked when he learned after being with me for four years that I love this series because I typically don't like raunchy movies but this series has so much more depth and sweetness besides the crude scenes. This movie and the songs brought back the 90's and my high school life. The comment about the spice girls being ""classic rock"" particulary hit home for me. I was recently at a party when a great song came on that a young teenager referred to as ""old school"", so I got that scene.",1366416000,,836,4.2974683544303796

4737353,3,B005LAIH9A,"I realize American Reunion is supposed to be part of the American Pie series, but those movies strike me as a lot funnier and just overall better from a storyline perspective.  Perhaps it's due to the fact the cast is now in their 30's and still trying to act like really young, immature sex-obsessed teenagers.  Of course this is pretty much what *has* to happen in order to sell the movie.  The American Pie series has a reputation to live up to after all.  The tradeoff is that whenever the characters *do* act like adults, it comes across as rather silly because we realize they're clearly not fit for marriage and especially not children.

We're supposed to overlook the immaturity of these characters and focus on the endless parade of sex jokes.  Well the good news is that many of the sex jokes are in fact funny despite the awkwardness of grown ups making them, but we then have to factor in the storytelling and believe me, it's quite dry.  WAY too many party scenes that accomplish very little, and certainly don't fit the category of being interesting.

Seriously, the segments that are actually funny to me are the ones that involve the 18-year old neighbor girl (who Jason Biggs used to babysit but is now an incredibly hot young lady).  When she rips her clothes off and tries to hit on the character of Jason Biggs during a late night drive, and afterwards when the choas ensues involving the same naked girl being taken to her bedroom without the parents realizing several men are walking upstairs and secretly trying to hide in her room are both worthy of movie writing.  Also, the part involving Seann William Scott taking a dump in a cooler that belongs to a few guys at the beach he happens to dislike, leading to Seann and his buddies taking the joke WAY too far by eventually smashing their jet skies between two trees during a car ride is another memorable one.

Other than these scenes (oh and of course the intro where the character of Jason Biggs is caught in his bedroom looking at porn by his youngest son, leading to the father trying to quickly hide it and one crazy set of circumstances after another occurring afterwards) the film just misses the mark on too many occasions.  Alyson Hannigan is also growing older and though still quite attractive, it's obvious by now that she's simply too old for this series.  Tara Reid has remained incredibly hot though.  Eugene Levy is probably a high point too- the relationship he has with a big-breated woman is funny (especially the hilarious popcorn bucket part at the end).  Still, the storyline is unappealingly dry and a 3-star rating is what I'm giving the movie.",1365897600,,2644,4.643776824034335
4737354,4,B005LAIH9A,"This is a great movie but not as good as the 3 previous movies.  Spoiler alert, Stifler learns a lesson and becomes their friend again.  I think that's a little played out now.  This could have been 5 stars if some of the content had deviated from the other 3 previous movies.  Step 1, get together.  Step 2, plan a party.  Step 3, awkward moments.

The message is there that things don't always turn out like we thought they would in life and getting older changes our perspectives, but the plot is a bit contrived and maybe not as polished as past projects.

In the end, he lends his perspective during his friend's troubles, and is seen as actually mature, all the while maintaining his obnoxiousness. Oz is his sentimental self, and dad (now a widower) attends Stifler's party and winds up with, well........use your imagination!!

4738154,2,B005LAIH9A,"Did the world need another slice of American Pie? The answer is, of course, no. And I'm referring to American Pie 2; the first in a set of unnecessary sequels, including four spin-offs. That the story continues to continue on, with an oddly-timed thirteen-year Reunion, thirteen years later, is a testament to the way the movie business works. It's not really about art. It's about money. So even moderately popular flicks spawn sequels almost automatically. That means this reunion just might be the first of more.

When we met Jim Levenstein, he and his three best friends were high school seniors with a pact to lose their virginity before graduation. Now he's married with a kid, Kevin is married, Oz is a professional sportscaster and Finch... rides a motorcycle. But we shouldn't know any of this. Their stories should've ended with their high school graduation. The rest should've been left to our imaginations. Instead we get what feels like an extended epilogue; one that's long passed the length of the story itself.

It is nice to see everybody again, particularly Stifler. He's not nearly as funny as he tries to be; the fake phone-call is the only thing he does that makes me laugh out loud; but his outrageousness makes him the funniest among semi-funny characters. It's just that the movie, as much as it tries with all its time-lapse jokes; Stifler pretends to read the Twilight series to connect with high school chicks and the Spice Girls Wannabe song now plays on the Classic Rock station; can only go so far on nostalgia alone.

Some hints of character development and unexpected twists in their backstories, but no apparent unifying goal like the first and best of the movies.

Bad sight gags and sexual jokes used for shock value.  Just seemed aimless and pointless, no matter how much you liked the characters previously.  (SPOILER! - Once you see Jason Biggs wake up hungover and naked, you suspect it might be a redo of The Hangover, which would give the movie at least have some potential, but there's no such luck as the scene's only use is for a sight gag involving Biggs' meat and potatoes and once that's done the movie just jumps mindlessly to the beach where some girls lose their bikinis to a bunch of losers, and the movie goes further downhill from there).

I have a rule - I gave each movie 20-30 minutes.  Then if they make it, and even most of those I don't like survive that test, I give them to the midpoint to be redeemed.  I loved American Pie the original, but I just couldn't give Reunion any more than 30 minutes of my time.

The cast and their characters just aren't worth our attention in this 4th installment, but I don't entirely blame for trying to rekindle the franchise.",1353196800,,1451,4.46969696969697

The movie was a good solid comedy.  It dragged at times, I laughed outloud a lot, I cringed, I even had to pause for a minute so I could stop laughing and hear the dialog. My husband (not a 1999) also enjoyed it...although probably not as much as I did.

Or rather what is the so-called 'unrated' cut missing? AM I blind??

Anyway, the film isn't bad. If you liked the first 3 films, I'm sure you'll like this film. It's largely more-of-the-same. The characters have all moved well beyond HS, got jobs, got married, got bored and want to relive a little high school mayhem. Which they do.

Movies like this find an audience because people can genuinely relate to what the characters are going through.
With the first film the kids were all in high school and I was already in my mid/late 20's.
I also don't remember acting that way in high school.
Granted the movie had some funny moments but for the most part I simply couldn't relate.
Same with part two when they're in college.
I figured what the heck I might as well at least say I saw all three of them.
So I rented this one.
And now that the kids are all grown up, done with school and have entered the adult phase of life I found myself laughing frequently.
Granted, they're still the same immature unrealistic bunch of brats they were from the first film but the brats turned in an excellent performance this time around.
Listening to them complain about work and adult life was something I could finally relate to.
I won't go into the plot details aobut each character but to summarize...
Great acting, direction, score, story.
I was expecting it to drag but none of it did.
The joys of adulthood.
Who says you can't be an adult and still be a moron?
I liked it enough that I'll end up buying it.

4739401,3,B005LAIH9A,"I enjoyed the original American Pie movie. The two sequels were disappointing, but American Reunion held promise. The high school reunion concept presented an opportunity to end the American Pie franchise on a high note by bringing back the cast one last time. Furthermore, a couple of the story lines (Jim and Michelle's struggle as young parents and Jim's dad) had the potential to inject heartfelt substance to the film.
Instead, this film reverted back to the familiar humor of raunch and sex. This time the formula is not effective. The characters are simply too old for these over-the-top situations. It was also a challenging task to work in all of the American Pie characters into the flow of the movie. To be fair, I enjoyed every scene with Eugene Levy.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

So Jim and Michelle are having marital problems, sex has become something that they don't do often because they have careers and a child that take up most of their time.  Oz is a sports announcer guy that is on an ESPN knock off, Stiffler is a temp working for some financial firm, Kevin is a stay at home husband, and Finch is traveling the world, or so he says, but he's really an assistant manager of a Staples in New Jersey.

We get the usual gags of Stiffler doing crazy things, Jim ending up in crazy situations that he has to explain himself out of and ends up having to make a big emotional heartfelt speech in order to get out of.

We also find out that Oz only wants to get back with the girl he fell in love with back in high school.  Kevin just wants to remain friends with Vicki, his first love, Stiffler just wants to keep partying and getting laid, Finch just wants people to think he is cool and find true love.

Of course we get the obligatory topless scenes and we also have a scene where we see Jim's junk, which I could have done without.

Also we get lots of cameos from our old favorites, Nadia, the Shermanator, Stiffler's mom, Jessica, and the MILF guys are back as well.  They all come together and make us laugh and make us remember how much fun we had with these movies back when they were just a trilogy and something that defined our teenage and college years.

(2.) The next indicator is the continuing saga theme - part 2, or whatever. A noncreative retelling to the marketable audience of previous viewers still stuck (or wishing they were) in early life fantasies.
(3.) Another indicator of cheap is ""Special Thanks"" often totaling around a hundred or so local volunteers, but not in this case as they got the ""Economic Development Team"" from a small Georgia town to foot some of the bill - better than spending money on a boring education system. That, and reusing old props; keeping the sets to a minimal few localities; using low cost returning actors who have, over the intervening years, relied on TV sitcoms, video shorts, cartoon voice-overs and unknown forgettable B films for sustenance.

Twelve to sixteen year olds and those who continued in that state having nothing more secure than in-your-face vandalism, potty jokes, alcohol/drug-of-choice quick fixes, bikini boob/ass fixation, and language reflective of a delayed mental development. America might slow it's decline if we enact a modified Sharia law on that infected male population. We would only lose 5 to 10%.

13 years have passed since audiences got their first taste of pie, and if you are a fan of the original series, this film will not disappoint. New writers and directors are installed for this one, however, all the cast is back, yes, even the `MILF' guys. The hilarious situations and gross out humour is still very much intact, as expected, however, there is a certain joy and nostalgia that comes from watching these beloved characters so many years on, and how their lives have changed (for better or worse). American Pie Reunion is a worthy addition to the series, and an excellent send off to some of the actors careers, who will forever be type casted and will rarely be seen again...Tara Reid, I'm looking at you.

Best bit?

Jason Biggs' attempts to chauffeur a hot drunken, exhibitionist home, unravels with a sequence of hilarious mishaps.

Did you know?

At eight films, Eugene Levy has become the only actor to be in every film in the American Pie franchise.",1343520000,,986,4.64367816091954
4739556,4,B005LAIH9A,"If you enjoyed the first film but didn't care for the sequels, you'll have fun with Reunion. It delivers the same level of coarseness and immaturity that made American Pie such a hit combined with a somber and reflective tone that shows how all the characters have grown up. Not that this movie is in any way downbeat but there is a sense that 13 years on, all the raucousness of college has been replaced by life as a 30-something.

Reunion brings back all the characters from the original with varying degrees of success. Vicky, Jessica and Heather's stories didn't have very far to go whereas Jim and Michelle, Oz and Finch had much better parts in the script. The stand-out role in the film is Stiffler, who carries the film through every scene he appears in - his one-dimensional, emotional tone-deafness is perfect for the non-stop hilarious one-liners.

As with the first movie, the first 30 minutes set-ups all the gags for the payoff in the finale. They continue and develop most of the famously amusing scenes. It was great to see Eugene Levy given more screen time and Rebecca de Mornay has a funny cameo towards the end.

After a few bumpy and forgettable sequels, American Reunion finally gives the audience something that's on par with the first. While not for the easily offended, if the first one was a guilty pleasure then you'll definitely find some solid laughs here.",1343433600,,1386,4.7190082644628095

Despite the gross-out gags and gratuitous nudity, the American Pie franchise is actually quite sweet and a very conservative heart beats underneath.  Good films versus great ones usually work out that way.  You think its about one thing, and it surprises you with depth.  When I first saw American Pie, I didn't want to go, thinking it would just be another vapid, teenage sex comedy.  I was dragged kicking and screaming (I wanted to see The Haunting) and it turned out to be a gem.  The other films have continued this funny but deep trend.

4739671,4,B005LAIH9A,"After an endless number of god awful direct to Dvd sequels that really had nothing to do with the original storyline (with the exception of Eugene Levy), Universal finally got with it and decided to do what the fans have wanted since 2003. A true sequel featuring the people we grew to know and love like Jim, Michelle, Stifler, and all the rest. It was 9 years in the making, but the wait was worth it.

Coming 9 years after ""American Wedding"", we catch up with the gang from East Great Falls. Someone made a mistake and missed the 10 year high school reunion, so they are having a 13 year reunion (although one wonders why not wait an extra two for the 15th?). The original gang all decide to return and attend the reunion, letting everyone in on what has gone on with their lives since we last saw them. Jim and Michelle (Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan) are still married and now have a small son. Stifler is, well, Stifler. No need to go into what everyone is up to, since that is part of the fun of watching the movie. Once everyone meets up again, it appears that old habits die hard, as more uproarious and dirty shenanigans and awkward situations arise in classic American Pie fashion.

""American Reunion"" does not miss a beat with the classic forumula that has come before in the first three films. It may be two different writers (Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg), but it feels like they were the writers of the first three. This movie is a warm trip back to nostalgiaville and doesn't pretend to be anything else but a movie trying to recapture the feel and tone of years past. Thank god. I wouldn't want it any other way. All the hallmarks we've come to expect (raunchy opening, bare breasts, bodily fluids, etc.) are here in full force, and they are as hilarious as ever. The cast is in fine form and all come back to their characters as if no time has passed. Naturally, Seann William Scott is the stand out as Stifler. He is still the same guy, which will probably never change, but does find himself in an era where he does face that some things are different. Eugene Levy also has a bigger part in this one and it is hysterical with what they have given him to do in this one. It is also great to see those who were missing from 'American Wedding'. That was a fine sequel, but with a number of characters missing, there was just a feeling of incompleteness. This movie corrects that. Plus, they all look great. Some not having even changed a whole lot since we last saw them.

Some people claim that we don't need another 'Pie' movie. Well, we don't need most of what we get. Why not just have fun and be entertained with characters and situations we like and enjoy? ""American Reunion"" is a movie that seems to be completely written and designed to be comfort food for fans who miss a certain era in time and in the movies that just isn't there anymore in these modern times. I won't remember most movies nowadays, but I will always remember the 'Pie' movies, and I will remember this one. What's also great is that the first three, especially the first one, were movies that had a heart. This movie also brings that back, but you feel it even more because you know these characters. You grew up with them over the years. It has a built in connection that actually makes you feel for these people and what happens that most one off films nowadays can't even begin to have.

In the end, ""American Reunion"" is a movie that feels like the good ones we used to see back in the day. It leaves you feeling all warm and nostalgic like you yourself had just gone to a reunion. It's hysterical, heartfelt, raunchy, wild, and even a little touching. I, for one, would be most excited if there was another adventure with Stifler and the gang.",1342828800,3,3749,4.413294797687861

It was nice to see most of the original cast and the memory lane pictures that rolled during the credits.  I had forgotten about the Shermanator, and finally, Stiffler gets revenge.  If you haven't seen the first (American Pie) you should get it and the other movies to include with American Reunion for an American Marathon.

Movie is made of predictable bad jokes by adults who never grew up, during a high school reunion. But then what would you expect from this bunch? Not as good as the first two, much more dirty (in language and inuendos) than the first two movies. Really degrading to young women.

Movie shows what really happens to people who don't get a real life and keep going to these totally unnecessary high school reunions. Get a life and put high school behind you. Stop thinking about the past and look into the future. Move on!

It Hit's all the marks in writing,direction,acting ect..Sean William Scott & Jason Biggs produced a winner! and may have revived the franchise of American Pie.

4739679,4,B005LAIH9A,"One of the first movies in the teen gross out genre was AMERICAN PIE. The movie was funny, had some jokes that a few people might find offensive and on the whole was quite entertaining. It was followed by a few lackluster sequels that never quite got the whole gang together again. So it's nice to see that everyone has come back for the reunion. AMERICAN REUNION that is.

Believe it or not it's been 13 years since we the teens in the series graduated and moved on. Yes, we know that Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and Jim (Jason Biggs) got married (one of the sequels). Jim works at a good job and they have a son now. What they don't have is an interesting sex life, the crux of their problem in this film.

What's up with everyone else? Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is in love with a working woman and about ready to tie the knot himself. He works at home as an architect and the couple tend to do more things that interest her than him but he's content. Oz (Chris Klein) is a sports announcer in LA whose girlfriend seems to be far more off the beaten path than he might like. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is a mystery with rumors of him traveling the world. And Stiffler (Seann William Scott) remains Stiffler, the ever adolescent party man who works as a temp assistant to a tyrannical boss.

All of these friends have kept in touch and seen one another from time to time, but this year they've decided to get together for their thirteenth class reunion. Not only that they're coming into town early to just get in touch with one another again. They omit Stiffler from the gathering but he finds his way to them anyway. And it's Stiffler that is the same as he was 13 years ago and who pulls them into their past.

The set ups for various jokes work well into the storyline. Going to the beach they all enjoyed when they were teens they do what all responsible adults do, they get drunk. This leads to a prank Stiffler finds hilarious and the others consider a little immature.

The little girl that Jim babysat while in high school is all grown up in every way imaginable and Jim can't believe his eyes. When she gets drunk at a party he takes her home only to have her hit on him. With the help of his friends he just might get her in the house without her parents finding him.

A party Stiffler throws is not quite what he expected with people from work more suit and tie with a bottle of wine than T shirt and keg. His party seems boring until he gets things rolling. This sequence has one of the funniest yet grossest jokes in it.

Misunderstandings and final reconciliations are in order and the movie does have a happy ending. No not one of THOSE happy endings although Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) does bring that up in a conversation. His story is one of the funniest as well as Jim's dad finds possible romance with Stiffler's mom. In any event there was never any doubt that the film would provide us with a happy ending and leave it open for another sequel and that might be a good thing. It's interesting to watch these teens grow into adults and see how they deal with one another as they change.

Amazingly enough the center piece of the film is the life of Stiffler. He misses the old days and while he may have been a jerk to the rest of the characters, he actually loved them as well. They were important to him and meant something to him. On his own he has little to feel good about but with these friends in tow he finds that person that's been missing since graduation.

The acting seen here is natural but then again these are characters that the actors should by now be very comfortable with. It's nice to see them reprise the roles that actually started some of their careers. Each one displays the character at a different time in their life and does it well.

For me the clincher to these movies and to the gross out raunchy teen films in general is was I entertained? I can honestly say yes, this movie does indeed entertain. It made me laugh. It made me care for characters I hadn't watched in some time. It made me reminisce about my high school years as well. It's nice to see a movie that one would place in a niche category swing about and complete so many more. Don't sell this movie out. It's well worth taking the time to see.",1342569600,3,4256,4.30875

4739891,4,B005LAIH9A,"As a huge fan of the American Pie series, I desperately wanted another movie featuring the main cast because I thought American Wedding just wasn't good enough. It made jokes that weren't funny and a large chunk of screen time was devoted to Stifler (not a terrible thing, but the scenes were garbage) with just lame material. And of course a lot of the principle cast was absent.

I saw a couple of the Pie spinoffs, but it was clear that many of us wouldn't view those movies as canon to the REAL series. When American Reunion was announced I thought it would be the prefect opportunity to wrap the series in a way the ""Wedding"" should have.

After buying the Blu-Ray and watching this one, I loved every single second of it! It felt like watching Pie 1 and 2 again and the characters felt real again, not like in ""Wedding"" where it felt like they were there for the paycheck.

Seeing all the main members of the cast back is a real treat for die-hard fans of the 1st movie and seeing cameos from the Sherminator, Nadia, the MILF guys and so on really added to a fun ride. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is I wish they would've given more screen time to Jessica (Natasha Lyonne). Vicky and Jess were real good friends so it would've made sense to have those two actually interact in the film. They kinda do in a deleted scene, but honestly it's a minor quibble.

The guys actually develop in this film and Stifler is as likable in this film as he's ever been and it's nice to see him finally acknowledged as part of the gang and the story for Jim's Dad is fresh and hilarious too.

I highly recommend this film, plot points from the previous films are recognized and mentioned and weaved into this film perfectly and I think it pays a great tribute to the series to end with this one.",1342483200,2,1796,4.333333333333333

Even though it was released thirteen years after the first American Pie, it sure didn't feel like it as the actors and actresses pretty much look and act the same as they did back in 1999. Sean William Scott continues to steal every scene he is in as Stiffler. Even though it is ""good"", American Reunion isn't the best in the series. I still think that award goes to American Pie 2 for being fast and funny pretty much from beginning to end. American Reunion has some slow spots and a lot of soap opera moments, with several relationship issues taking place. Still, it's worth seeing for fans of the series.

The first night the gang gets back together old feelings come back and new problems arrive. Just when you think things can't go worse...they do. I'm not sure the term growing up with this movie applies because the first one came out when I was in college, but that's what it felt like. I remember the first one being so amazingly funny and raunchy and unlike anything that had come out until then. Fast forward to today and if you re-watch that one it seems so tame and almost PG-13 compared to todays movies. What I noticed about this one first off is that besides being funny it had a lot more heart in it then the recent high school drinking movies. Also unlike most sequels being made long after the series stopped this one actually made sense to do one and the writing was actually pretty good. All that said this is still an ""American Pie"" movie meaning there are some over the top scenes and the gang gets into things that seem to get worse and worse. As usual the best scenes involve Jim's (Biggs) Dad (Levy) and actually Stiffler seemed more tame in this one then the others. I have to say though that the ending of this one was perfect.

Be aware that this movie does have its crude humor in it so it is not appropriate for young audiences due to the humor and the overall content and message that it is sharing. That being said though, the movie was funny and the cast did a great job together again! I also loved all of the amazing extras that the Blu-Ray provides you as a viewer. There were so many fun games and interactive aspects of the disc that allow you to better know the characters and the actors playing them as well as what goes into the writing and directing if a movie such as this.

4740088,2,B005LAIH9A,"I normally begin these reviews with a question. My only question for this film, the fourth in the series, why?

  All our favorite sex-obsessed high-school students are now 13 years older and experiencing varied levels of disappointment with the current state of their lives. Jim Levenstein (played by Jason Biggs) is married to the same girl he's loved since high school and they have a two-year old son. They are completely out of synch romantically. Jim's (Biggs') sex life revolves around his laptop and Michelle, his wife, (played by Alyson Hannigan) is dependant on mechanical devices. Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (played by Chris Klein) is a TV sports anchor living with a supermodel. I said he was unhappy with his life, I didn't say I could explain why. Kevin (played by Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a married architect who works from home in addition to running the household. Lastly, Steven Stifler (played by Seann William Scott) is still carrying an attitude big enough to fill most rooms and some buildings despite working as a poorly-paid office temp and living at home with his mother. Even though they missed the ten-year mark by three years, Kevin, Oz, and Jim decide to plan a reunion and ""forget"" to invite Stifler. But, somehow, he shows up anyway.

  I didn't catch any of the spin-off films, e.g. American Pie presents The Naked Mile, Beta House, or The Book of Love. I did see Band Camp, and will regret it till the day I die. Having seen the original film and both the canonical sequels, I can say unequivocally that there's nothing new here. Embarrassment, obscenity, and nudity from people who really have no business being naked anywhere, let alone onscreen.",1336176000,2,1675,4.859649122807017
4740089,5,B005LAIH9A,"After many long years of waiting has finally come, and with American Pie 4: The class reunion is now the third sequel to the cult comedy cinema.

Caveat: The wait has been worth it! Just as everyone is at ease in front of his class reunion. The stars of the past, have lost nothing.

We have seen the movie on 04/24/2012 at Herne in the sold-out preview.

With this 4th Part of it is the creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz and for the first time as Executive Producers Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott worked perfectly all the characters, and that really all the characters back into their roles back to the screen to bring .

When the film began and now sparkled even the first song with the Universal globe on the screen, it was clear we are back in the American Pie universe.

American Pie 4 is completely on the nostalgia factor, and this is precisely the strength of the film. We are also explained in exactly the characters so we feel as if you never left. Stifler is, as always, has not achieved much, and still lives with his mum, Finch is the coolest type on earth, Oz is a sports presenter and famous celebrity dance-off (Here is also a cool cameo by Neil Patrick Harris), Jim and Michelle are married or have a young son but your relationship seems to problem, Vicky is single and looking forward to the reunion, Heather has a devious doctor as a friend, and Kevin is now home and looks far too much television.

The good thing about this film is that he remains true to himself and relies on nostalgia, and not tailored to the hangover generation. Just dig at the Hangover, Justin Bieber and Twilight has me very much. I'm Twilight opponents and makes Stifler down Twilight, what more could you want ;) Right here comes the boys a high school reunion just right, but you quickly find that it is just not as used to. And here is another very Decisive thickness of the film, as falls or is hereby this film. When the guys come together, it really is with immediate effect as the past. You have lost nothing, wit, charm swipes everything is back to it without ever come to below the belt. Stifler's perpetual loggerheads with Finch (problem: Stifler's mom). This time also allowed Jim and Stifler's mom with dad at the party and just the two concerns for a lot of jokes. Overall, the whole film a gag fireworks. It is an absolute fan film. All the memories are just fun part 1-3. The stories about each character was lovingly and worked out in minute detail. Even the little cameos from Milf Guy 1 and 2, Nadia, Sherman and Jessica are just great.

Spoiler! Personally, I love the fact that Finch evolved and no longer thinks only of Stifler's mom. Stifler Gets His Revenge (A certain mother shows up) Jim and Michelle, as always, is the final. Heather and Oz have for me personally, but the most beautiful part of the whole movie. At the end of the film for any fan or a reference to part 5 is provided. End spoiler! For me, the soundtrack is a very important point. Part 4 has a very good soundtrack, but he can not reach the other soundtracks of 1-3.

The acting was just as benefits are very good in Parts 1-3 and even Tara Reid (Vicky Lathum) can sometimes points here ;). At the end remains to say who'd like to have long loud laugh in this film is just right. If you could start with the parts 1-3 can probably nothing will not do anything with this part. Although everyone has to try it yourself ;).

Who was the trailer is already well surprised as the movie itself is still a lot better. The film holds more than it promises, and I was not disappointed as the Years of a fan but I think with such a high level to please even a 5th Part will follow. I could continue writing long hours but then I would make the film a synopsis ;) American Pie 1 9/10 American Pie 2 10/10 American Pie 3 9/10 American Pie 4 9/10 Be sure to sit up after the credits remain important ;) American Pie 4 gets me 9/10 but only in comparison to Part 1-3 smooth or he would get 10/10.

This movie is possibly the best of all, provided you've watched the original trilogy so you're aware of all the plot lines.  Everything gets both revealed and tied together expertly in this movie.  The main characters end up with who they're supposed to, storylines get closed, and there's plenty of raunchy fun along the way, including the familiar plot of stupidity getting people into trouble and love getting them out.

The only way they could continue now would be to continue the story line of Erik from 6.  AP9 could conceivably feature Erik rising to take Dwight's place in the Beta house.  There is no continuation of 7, none of us want to see Nathan or Lube or Rob again.

If they tried to come out with another film with the original cast, it would be pointless.  This movie just wraps it all up perfectly.  If you were a fan of the original trilogy, this is a must-see.",1335312000,,989,4.4692737430167595
4740122,4,B005LAIH9A,"When ""American Pie"" came out in 1999 it was a box office smash. It was a movie that cost $10 million and banked over $235 million. That was enough to spawn two legit sequels and two not-so-legit sequels. The two legit sequels, ""American Pie 2"" & ""American Wedding"", in my opinion, failed to capture the magic of the first movie. ""American Pie"" was about high school kids, teen angst and sexual exploration but the thing that put it over the top was the honesty and truthfulness behind it. They weren't afraid to tackle taboo subjects, but they did it with honesty. The sequels relied too heavily on the angst and gross out jokes.

Another thing ""American Pie"" did was make stars out of Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Alyson Hannigan, Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid and Seann William Scott. All of them rose to quick fame and some of them, Hannigan (How I Met Your Mother), have managed to hang onto that fame or increase it. Some of them have fallen right off the map, so it was a perfect time for a sequel and a return of the old cast. They are all back and sure, they all needed career boosts, but they also came back for good reason. The script for ""American Reunion"" is better and the audience that came to the original movie grew to love the characters.

 There are jokes that are rehashed from the original and the raunchy nature of the films is completely intact, but more importantly the writers remembered the truth and honesty that pushed ""American Pie"" over the hump.  Of course the laughs were important as well.

 The best part about ""American Reunion"" is that they gave veteran actor and SCTV alum, Eugene Levy (Splash, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show), a big part in this one. Having been a widow for the past three years, he's content with his Sudoku and nights at home alone until his son returns for his 13-year class reunion. Once out of the house, he steals the show.

 ""American Reunion"", much like the entire series, isn't for everyone. It is offensive and at times gross, but at the same time it manages to be poignant and truthful. It is an entertaining film with all the characters returning 13-years later in real life as well. We all need our friends and if you were invested in the characters 13-years ago, you won't want to miss this either.",1334534400,28,2265,4.534313725490196
4740123,5,B005LAIH9A,"Well, I am 25 now, and for awhile I've been struggling with some feelings concerning the things I used to like not being relative or popular anymore, moving onto new hobbies and leaving other things I was constantly into behind, having a broader view on many different subjects, having different opinions on things that I used to feel a certain way about, etc. To put it mildly, I am growing up. I've realized it's important to hold onto things from your past, but you also have to be ready, both feet planted on the ground and facing forward, for the future and what it brings as life continuously changes. To live in the past is death, and I feel that this movie perfectly sums up my feelings and gives them a voice.

  I was expecting way more off color jokes, but this movie was SURPRISINGLY deep to me. If you are a warm blooded male, you can remember a time when chasing women was a main reason for living at one point...which has pretty much been the backbone of the American Trilogy...Hey, Stiffler and Finch, were all about Cadence in ""American Wedding"" despite Jim and Michelle tying the note being the big deal in that film. But here the tone is DRASTICALLY changed. The boys are still themselves, but older. New challenges arise, as they do with any grown man who is heading into adulthood and away from the care-free days of being a teenager or young adult in their early 20's.

  Also, Jim's mom being dead (I hope I didn't spoil this, but I assume we all saw the previews) and the challenges faced by Jim's father, Noah, in moving on also struck a cord with me ( I lost my mother this year) and gave this film a ""REAL"" feeling. So we not only saw, young thirty somethings dealing with the loss of youth and the expectations of adulthood, but we also witnessed an elderly man recovering from the heart break of losing the love of his life and the mother of his son. (SOMETHING ANY MARRIED PERSON WHO STICKS IT OUT UNTIL THE END WILL UNFORTUNATELY COME TO ONE DAY)

  Most of all, I think the challenges faced by the boys (I mean, men) in their marriages and dealing with their relationships struck the deepest with me because they were authentic problems I think all adult males will run into some of them, at some point in their lives. How they were all handled though, came off as beautiful to me. Watch Vicki's and Kevin's scene at the actual reunion, towards the end of the film, and tell me you don't feel your heart get tugged at a smidge, if not a lot, at the dialogue and how it's finalized.

  Keep an open mind and you will enjoy this. When I was young...The adults I saw in their 20's and 30's were ""The Real Adults"" to me. Anyone over that, was an ""old person."" Well, funny how things work out. I am sure kids now look up to me as ""A real adult"" and my father, uncles, and their friends are now ""The Old people,"" when they used to be ""The real adults""...funny how things change, but still stay the same overall...and that's the perfect way to describe this film. The tone is EXTREMELY different, but the characters are still the same, and still extremely enjoyable. As one character said in the film to another (I think it was Choir chick to Chris)...""You are so different, but you are still the same.""

  If you are going to see 1 movie in theaters for a long time, make it this one. Thanks for reading, and maybe bring some kleenex, if you are emotionally mature and inclined to being moved by well done movies.",1334188800,36,3439,4.393700787401575
4740124,5,B005LAIH9A,I love the American pie Movies. This movie was so funny. non stop laughs!!! Jim's Dad is always so funny along with his wife and the rest of the Gang. I'm Sure that they will not end it there. I hope they keep going.,1334188800,10,216,3.9318181818181817
4740125,4,B005LAIH9A,"The whole gang is back for a high school reunion and they must deal with adult problems of marital difficulties, career stagnation, and culture change since 1999. They attempt to deal with all this while trying to have a blast at their reunion get-together. There is a little raunchy humor and some nudity in this one, but I found it quite funny and entertaining. It was good to see the old faces from a 90's comedy classic all together again, and up to some of their old tricks. Their lives have changed since high school, but they still know how to have a good time. This is a film series that has a pretty funny current installment.",1334016000,,635,4.435897435897436
4740126,4,B005LAIH9A,"It's hard to believe that American Wedding came out in 2003 and that there's a nine year gap between that movie and the latest installment American Reunion. I guess I was never that big of a fan of the first three movies. The first one was pretty good, but the two sequels were just kind of okay. They do probably deserve a revisit, but I was always more of a Van Wilder and Harold & Kumar fan. It's weird saying that because American Pie paved the way for not only those R-rated comedies, but basically every other one since then. Much like the characters in the movie, we've all grown up and moved on since Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle's (Alyson Hannigan) wedding. Maybe that's why there wasn't much anticipation on my end for American Reunion. That's kind of the beauty of the theatrically released American Pie movies; you always seem to under-anticipate them and they always deliver something that's better than you ever could have hoped for.

American Reunion begins with the same scene that's at the beginning of the trailer and plays out in a similar fashion to that of Not Another Teen Movie's opening sequence, but with more member-crushing. Jim, Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have plans to reunite in East Great Falls, Michigan for a guy's weekend before their thirteenth high school reunion. Everyone has moved on and either has a family now or an incredible job in another city except for Stifler (Seann William Scott) who's now a single temp at a law firm. With cameos and small roles for nearly every character you've grown to love over the span of the franchise, this is one weekend these friends will remember and cherish forever.

American Reunion offers this huge slice of nostalgia as it seems like you know and have grown up along with these characters. While the raunchiness is still very much alive and well and results in some of the most memorable moments ever (the kitchen scene and Stifler getting back at the teenagers at the lake), American Reunion has just as much sentimental value as it does obscene humor. There's just as much emphasis on new and old relationships, drama between characters, and everlasting friendship that there is on jokes involving male genitalia and fecal matter. Some of the best moments of the movie are between Jim and his dad (Eugene Levy). They juggle between being really touching and downright hilarious due to their awkwardness.

Perhaps it's because Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (writers/directors of the three Harold & Kumar movies) came on board that American Reunion feels like a bit of a step up for the franchise. Well, anything probably is after the direct to DVD sequels. It almost seems like American Reunion manages to return to its roots while also offering a little bit more in the emotional department. It could just be I related to the movie since I often feel like I'm running in place career-wise much like these characters and that all my friends seem to be moving on and having families while I don't, but that only adds to the fact that this is a really entertaining adult comedy. American Reunion is downright hysterical at times and unexpectedly reflective at others.",1333756800,6,3205,4.802536231884058
4740127,5,B005LAIH9A,"So, it has been years since the last release in the series, or at least what I recognize as the last release in the series(american wedding), and after all of the hoping, wishing & praying, I finally got my wish! Just saw the new movie yesterday(opening day release).

Let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed American Reunion!
What a story! A group of PALS that go through good times & bad times with Each Other & always are there for each other.
Hillarious moments throughout the movie, plenty of jokes & many lines in this movie to relate/remember the past movies!

Of course all of the Original Cast was back & each cast member kept in tune with their original roles.

I like the fact that this movie in the series stayed True to the storyline, antics, characters & humor to the previous big 3 of American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding!
The script & writing was Perfect!
It was never OVER THE TOP stupid jokes!
I never got bored during this movie, and even though it could be considered a bit predictable at times, the story was sooooo goooood, it kept me on the edge of my seat & it had plenty of BIG surprises.

Each character brought back so many AWESOME memories from the Original first 3 releases.
Every actor played their respective roles to perfection!
Each character showed characteristics of the younger days, but maturity of the older days...

The movie is a bit raunchy, but it is AMERICAN PIE people, what else would you expect???
If they changed the formula, it would Flop & not be good for the True fans!

I give this movie an A+ and hope they make another one in the series!

Thanks for reading my review!",1333756800,4,1632,4.474747474747475
4740128,5,B005LAIH9A,"This movie was great! Another helping of the original American Pie recipe. None of that store bought crap like Band camp, Naked mile, or any of those other stupid spinoffs. Sorry for the pie puns, but this movie just delivered as great as its three prequels. The original cast is back and just as great as ever. The story's interesting, raunchy, keeps you watching every second to see what happens next, and reminds you of the good times like before and gives you some hilarious new ones as well. Don't want to give out any spoilers, so if you like the first three, definitely see this movie. The only cons I found through the whole thing was that some of the original minor characters only had a couple lines or so. But they're minor for a reason. I really hope they put out a boxed bluray quadrilogy, but then again, they might not be done yet as the ending sort of hints to a possible sequel. Maybe an American Wedding 2? !!!!!Here's to hoping!!!!!!!!!!!!",1333670400,,958,4.511494252873563
4740129,5,B005LAIH9A,"Just got back from a sneak preview of this and I LOVED it.

If you liked American Pie and it's first sequels (and their raunch level), you will really enjoy this great return from the original cast.

The Class of 1999 gets together for their 13th year reunion (really? 13th? well, that's not going to spoil the rest of the movie) and we get to catch up with what life after high school is like for everyone.  For the most part, everyone's personalities are the same, and the writers and actors did a great job of projecting those characters into adulthood.  Although projecting an older Stifler still doesn't seem like ""adulthood...""

I don't want to give away any of the jokes, but this was a really funny movie.... funnier than I expected, to be honest.  And not only will the audience be consistently laughing out loud, but viewers will also feel an unexpected nostalgia in watching.

As I said, I did expect it to be funny, but this movie is MUCH better than I expected.

As with other crude comedies, this will probably play slightly better in the theaters, because of audience reactions, but this is a wonderful return from the cast, and is very well written and directed.

Go see this movie!",1332374400,49,1198,4.586854460093897
