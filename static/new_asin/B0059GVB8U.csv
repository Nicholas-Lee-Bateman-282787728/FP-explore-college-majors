8462942,4,B0059GVB8U,"This is a highly subjective rating because you have to like old movies,and have an interest in the actors who appear in them,in order to buy them at all. The story lines in these two films are fine,about right for the time when they were made, and reflecting the way many directors approached their subjects in the 1930's-40's, somewhat less robustly than today! However,my real interest was in the star Anna May Wong ,because she was an Asian-American actress,very much before her time,and one who would have certainly ranked with the best today,had she been born eighty years later!  She suffered much from prejudiced typecasting back then,never being allowed to step out of roles that portrayed her as part of the""yellow peril which was the mysterious,decadent East"",and that's a great pity,because her potential is plain to see,when her performances in these two films are watched. What a strong, intelligent,romantic lead the World never really saw,the wonder of it is,she continued to persevere at all!!",1501286400,,1009,5.152439024390244

8462944,1,B0059GVB8U,"OK, unusually I'm putting in a review without owning the product but I do own Alpha releases for other titles and not one has been worth it (even at basement price). Alpha specialises in producing low quality digital transfers of low quality VHS copies. They are never from the original prints (perhaps someone can correct me here - Hello Alpha?) and are in many cases the wrong aspect ratio having been taken from a VHS copy. Judging by another reviewers comments on the seperate release of ""Bombs over Burma"" this is a classic pathetic Alpha transfer so if 1 of the 2 movies in this set is known to be crap you can pretty well assume they both are. In short, save your $10 for a couple of frosty Millers or Buds (OK Coors as well), You'll enjoy them more than the Alpha transfers (well maybe not the Coors).",1379548800,4,809,4.436241610738255
