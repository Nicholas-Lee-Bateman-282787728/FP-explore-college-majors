5716528,5,B00CDV4JG0,Put the kids to bed before you watch this series! Finally a gritty and fun side of Lupin the 3rd! I watched this when it was subtitled months ago. I'm a huge Lupin fan and this scared me at first. The more I watched though the more I needed to watch! It keeps you on the edge of your seat as you are given cryptic hints. This is a great starter for anyone new to Lupin the 3rd!,1374364800,4,377,3.8461538461538463
5716529,5,B00CDV4JG0,"One of the wonderful things about Lupin the Third is how well the concept takes to different visions. It's undoubtedly helped give the franchise its Bond-like longevity - Lupin has three TV shows, five films, and over a dozen annual specials to his name, not to mention an adoring fanbase in his home country of Japan and worldwide. There's an undeniable charm to the heist-meets-hijinks formula, and The Castle of Cagliostro sits comfortably in my top five films list.

 That being said, many of the Lupin offerings have become increasingly safe and formulaic over the years, and for every fun and fast paced Fuma Conspiracy there's a staggeringly awful and leaden Dead or Alive to match it. What the franchise needed was a shot of fresh concepts straight to the heart, and that's what The Woman Called Fujiko Mine delivers.

 The series acts as a fresh introduction for new fans and focuses on series mainstay Fujiko Mine, here played as the Irene Adler to Lupin's Sherlock Holmes (a refreshing change from the damsel in distress or last minute backstabber options usually presented). The early episodes are a heist-of-the-week format, detailing Fujiko's first meetings with Lupin and the other core members of the original cast. Behind all that, however, lurk dark memories of Fujiko's past, hallucinogenic drugs and experiments, and a mysterious figure who might just be pulling the strings behind everything...

 The creative team behind Fujiko Mine is top notch: from the Monkey Punch manga-reminiscent designs of Takeshi Koike (Redline), to the killer jazz soundtrack produced by Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop), the show is packed with talent. It also boasts the fairly rare distinction of both its director (Sayo Yamamoto) and head writer (Maya Okada) being women, setting the show apart not just from Lupins before but a great deal of anime then and now. As far as languages, this is a show to be watched in English. While the Japanese performances are strong, Sonny Strait is clearly ecstatic to be back in the chair as Lupin (and in fact campaigned quite a bit for this series to get a home release). His passion for the character radiates through the dub from the script to the ensemble performances, lending a breathtaking liveliness to the proceedings. If there's a complaint to be made it's that Strait sometimes has difficulty with the darker edges of this Lupin, but it's more than made up for by the incredible acting on the part of the ensemble (of particular note are Michelle Ruff's return as Fujiko and Josh Grelle's superb turn as Oscar).

  As pacing goes, I mentioned that it's deceptive. Things start out with the purely episodic approach of the original series, but it quickly becomes clear that they're building to something. Every episode lends something to the overall mythos, be it a character or theme or bit of plot (anathema to the continuity-free zone of the older series). It's also a show that works on two levels, accessible to newcomers and steeped in Lupin lore both: from being a self-aware 60s time period piece reminiscent of the Cold War era mentality movies like Secret of Mamo were made in, to the numerous visual references to the series and films, there is a lot to love and a lot of love behind the making of this show. It's certainly strictly for adults, not just for the abundant nudity and sexual themes but also the dark overtones of abuse present in the plot. But for those looking for an access point to the intimidating Lupin canon or just a gorgeous noir thrill ride, this is the place to be.

***

 I would be remiss if I didn't touch on the controversy of this show among Lupin fans, and make my own defense. It is somewhat regrettable that talking about the show means talking about its ending, since it's one of those makes-sense-in-hindsight approaches. For those already willing (because following the twists is a major part of the show's fun), take the above recommendation for what it's worth, and remember that Fujiko Mine is ultimately as much a story about storytelling as it is about the world of Lupin III. For everyone else, there are MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD.

 The two most argued additions to this bit of Lupin canon are new character Oscar and the back-story seemingly given to former free spirit Fujiko. The latter, first, is either because it adds a cheap `edginess' to the tone or because it becomes meaningless once the memories are revealed to be implanted. Fujiko Mine, as I mentioned, is pretty aware of itself and the usual tropes of its genre. You can't trip these days without finding a femme fatale with a tragic past to explain why she enjoys sex and crime (while giving the same to a character like Lupin would be unheard of). Playing to that expectation only to yank it back at the end (with the deliberate subtext of a creator `rewriting' an existing character through the memory implants) gives Fujiko back her agency - it's not some tragic defect in her character, but her own freedom of choice that leads to the life she lives, something the show goes on to present as valid. Even before then, Fujiko is always granted agency in her sexuality, and has a wide variety of relationships with the other women in the series. I'd go so far as to say that it gender-flips the common disposable girl-of-the-week formula even as the female body (Fujiko's, by her choice, with a variety of dress for other female characters) is put on display. It's an interesting approach to a feminist work - not always successful, particularly as Lupin talks Fujiko through the last of her fake memories, but novel and thought provoking.

 Second, and often heated, is the addition of Zenigata's subordinate Oscar. Oscar is a character about whom little is explained and much suggested, and he's often maligned either for existing as a `fanservice character' due to his obsession with Zenigata, or for a poorly handled character arc. To put things on front street, he's one of my favorite things about the series. As a character, Oscar makes the most sense not as Zenigata's sounding board but as a foil to Fujiko. Quite a bit of the visual imagery suggests that he too was a victim of the `what if' memory experiment, and in hindsight his actions are directly opposite the protagonist's: excessively covering clothing, repugnant feelings towards his own sexuality and that of others, and ultimately madness without anyone to talk him through it. Hence why his arc ends with the destruction of the castle and the other Fujiko `rejects', rather than his apparent death in ""Feast of Fools"" - his arc isn't just about his feelings for Zenigata but his own shredded sense of identity.

  He's also a deconstruction, much like Fujiko. The Lupin franchise has had its share of cross-dressing misogynists, who are that way because...reasons. Oscar, meanwhile, is a product of the show's era: a man who resorts to female clothing because he feels he has no other recourse in his society for getting Zenigata's attention. The image of assuming an identity because there is no place for his `natural' self is a pretty unique approach to the character type while also poking at some very real assumptions about Queer individuals (particularly at the time, when gay men were often assumed as wanting to be women). If the main thrust of the narrative is concerned with women - how their stories are told, appropriated, twisted, and finally reclaimed - then Oscar's story is about the Queer narratives that are NOT told, and how even the supposed progress of having a character means nothing if the story offers no depth outside of tired stereotypes. By offering ample evidence but not drawing attention to it, and by leaving an open resolution, Yamamoto forces the reader to confront the blank space left where Oscar's story by rights should be, and to question why it's so. The relatively little screen-time given to him is admittedly frustrating on a casual watching, but there's a deft hand of layers here that elevates my respect for the character and the director immensely.

 These, obviously, are my own interpretations, and a series like Fujiko Mine is one that begs discussion alongside enjoyment. It's a rare gem, and I look forward to seeing more from Saya Yamamoto in the future. If nothing else, this is a breath of fresh air for Lupin, one that stands alongside the lighter fare without erasing it. Variety, after all, is the longevity of any idea.",1373673600,8,8418,4.852264808362369

The soundtrack is some type of weird funky jazz meets avant garde.  Best of all, after years of completely safe, fun for the whole family characterizations, the Lupin gang finally get their edge back.  Unlike most other Lupin shows, this one is squarely aimed at adults, more akin to the original Monkey Punch manga and closer in spirit to the very first few episodes of the original Lupin TV series (before they were forced to tone things down in order to appeal to a wider audience for ratings).

This retelling of the early days of the Lupin Gang is nothing short of brilliant.  The daringly different animation style and character designs fit the story being told to perfection.  Sketchier renderings, darker tones, and an art style that is more true to the manga (though it doesn't duplicate Monkey Punch's original designs) is highly appropriate for something that starts as an unrestrained, chaotic, erotic romp and gradually morphs into tense gothic horror.

5716560,5,B00CDV4JG0,"Generally speaking, I'm not a big anime buff. Out of the handful that have won me over, Lupin the Third has wormed its way deepest into my heart.  So I'm surprised that it still hasn't entered the mainstream in the United States, despite enjoying a popularity in Japan for nearly five decades that rivals that of James Bond elsewhere.

Lupin's most well-known adventures internationally are probably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lupin-the-III-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro-Special-Edition/dp/B000FGG5NK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lupin the III: The Castle of Cagliostro (Special Edition)</a>, an action-packed but largely G-rated romp from Hayao Miyazaki, and the 1977 - 1980 anime series, a zany Saturday morning type of cartoon known by most fans as the ""red jacket series.""  There's nothing Saturday morning or G-rated about the character's latest series, but it's arguably the best thing to happen to the franchise since Miyazaki's 1979 entry.

This is a darker, edgier reboot in the current trend, taking a more adult, character-focused approach to the series.  It reimagines the first meeting of master thief Lupin III, allegedly the grandson of Maurice Lablanc's Arsene Lupin, sharp-shooter Daisuke Jigen, and swordsman Goemon Ishikawa XIII, through a different point of view; this time, the focal character is femme fatale Fujiko Mine, a popular character who, in most recent specials, has been shrunken to a supporting role.  Here, she's presented as the series' lead.  Sayo Yamamoto is the first female director to helm a Lupin series.  It seems all the franchise needed was a woman's touch.

This one definitely isn't for the kids.  The opening titles alone are almost filled with enough nudity to make series creator Monkey Punch blush.  Fujiko isn't shy about going unclothed, particularly throughout the first couple of episodes.  That said, I'd hesitate to call it ""fan service"", as the term brings to mind usually-innocent characters going to a beach to model skimpy swimsuits or other such improbable situations.  Fujiko Mine is a classic femme fatale who uses her body as the deadliest weapons in her arsenal.  Her nudity services the character, not just the fans.

The Woman Called Fujiko Mine manages to strip each of the five classic leads down to just the qualities that make them cool.  Lupin, boasting the green jacket from his first anime and Cagliostro, is still a goofball with a flair for the dramatic, but the new series paints him more realistically, making him more eccentric than plain cartoonish.  Jigen is as cool as ever, with a new backstory that explains his attachment to his iconic weapon.  Goemon is a surprise stand-out.  While stories throughout the franchise that have centered on the character have traditionally been among the weakest, this version keeps the elements that work for the character and jettison the ones that never quite have. For the first time, this Lupin anime had me wanting to see more Goemon.

Fujiko Mine in the original manga wasn't a consistent character so much as a name applied to most of the women Lupin and his gang encountered. Here, she's the main character, something proven when Lupin himself sits three of the thirteen episodes out.  Different episodes focus on different sides of Fujiko, competing with the others for loot or simply observing their adventures.

The most interesting character reboot might be Lupin's nemesis, Inspector Zenigata.  Often portrayed as a bumbling cop, this version of Zenigata is more hard-boiled, willing to stop at nothing to catch Lupin.  He has a tryst with Fujiko and doesn't seem overly concerned with bringing Lupin in alive.  He's also given an androgynous subordinate named Oscar, who goes from merely being Zenigata's shadow to becoming a major player in the series' events, with an agenda of his own.  Not every episode is concerned with shoe-horning all the major players into the plot, so each has a chance to shine.

 While darker and edgier, there's still plenty of Lupin's trademark humor.  Even when Zenigata is trying to draw blood, his cat-and-mouse game with Lupin feels as much like a Bugs Bunny cartoon as it ever has, and Lupin's love of pranks is still very much in play.

The unique art style really makes this series stand out.  While the pencil work and cross-hatching are reminiscent of Monkey Punch's original manga, to say the art style is pulled directly from the source is to sell character designer Takeshi Koike short.  The art style's unlike anything I've seen in any anime or Western animation, and, for the most part, the animation itself is smooth, making even some of the wackier movements look fluid and natural.  The score is also worth mentioning, with Naruyoshi Kikuchi's electric jazz suffering only in comparison to Yuji Ohno's long established themes.

Interestingly, while the episodes are divided almost evenly between the two included DVD's, the Blu-Ray separates the episodes at the point when the series moves from mostly stand-alone capers with overarching motifs in the background to a central plot which attempts to tie all the loose threads together.  While these episodes are still watchable and don't go completely off the rails, the episodes on the first disc, which most closely follow the classic Lupin formula, are far more enjoyable.

Funimation's release includes both the original Japanese audio and an English dub.  This is good news for those who prefer reading subtitles, as they get solid voice performances from seyiuu with varying degrees of experience with the characters; most impressively, Kiyoshi Kobayashi has been voicing Jigen for a solid forty years, since the original anime.  There's good news for dub fans as well, as Funimation's cast does the series justice.  Sonny Strait does a wonderful job voicing a more smart aleck-y Lupin, while Christopher R. Sabat's naturally gravelly voice is perfect for Jigen.  Among Funimation's usual players, Mike McFarland's Goemon doesn't fare as well, but is still serviceable, and an improvement over his performance as the character in earlier Funimation dubs.

For several Lupin fans, myself included, the definitive English voices are the cast of the Geneon dubs of the 1977 - 1980 series, so it's a real treat that voices from those dubs round out the cast. Richard Epcar, Geneon's Jigen, voices Zenigata here, playing the character like a film noir lead, adding to his new hard-boiled feel.  The most critical casting is Fujiko herself.  Michelle Ruff is the only English voice I've ever fully accepted for the character, and it's a thrill to hear her reprise the role.

Special features include commentaries and interviews with the Funimation dub cast.  While these are fun, and the voice actors have the chemistry you'd expect from Lupin and his gang, they also demonstrate how removed dubbing is from the complete project, with the cast members stating several times that they have yet to see the complete episodes and sharing some dubious Lupin trivia.

Overall, The Woman Called Fujiko Mine is a unique and memorable series that I'd say is worth a look for anyone, anime fan or not, Lupin III fan or not.",1389830400,17,7183,5.201563857515204

There is lots of nudity and blood, but this isn't the classic Lupin caper-show of yore, so you should expect that coming in.

There's a bit of a Cowboy Bebop feel to the first few episodes, until the main plot kicks up, which honestly wasn't my favorite part -- the main plot, that is.  I ... guess ... it makes sense when you're done watching it, but it seems like a real stretch to say it's truly coherent.  Let's just say that the end will be as polarizing as the art direction -- you'll probably either love the character-driven episodes (which I did) or prefer the plot-driven episodes (which I didn't).

Either way, if you're a Lupin-fan who still appreciates adult content and isn't afraid of your beloved characters being slightly re-envisioned, you may rather like this.",1388188800,,1044,4.7032967032967035

whoever thou that learning the back story of one of the recurring main character can make u so scare.  Fujiko in the original tv show was just a friendly backstabber,  but before that, she was just meannnnn(but she was a lot more of a flirt thou).  this show have lot of fan service from fujiko herself, so any of u who alway wanna see her butt naked will get it, hell the opening is already giving u all of that.  oh, but don't expect to get turn on thou, cause I feel bad for the fool who try to bed this woman, or when she try to bed that fool(especially)  cause u know she aint in it for the loving, or cause u handsome.
Fan of the series gonna hesitate a bit going into this, but it is still lupin, it focus on fujiko, cause it is her story for the first half, but at the second half, it all about lupin, as we see him untangle this mess of a mystery.  i basicly a 12 episode long movie, with the backstory being rag on for a bit so we understand how dangerous a femme fatale really are(dont trust golddigger boy)
anyway, this show would make the feminist cry out for the boy to run away, cause even they are gonna be scare of Fujiko, so no sexist here folk, just go in and enjoy the show, art, music, and lupin.  no fanservice here, just fujiko service, and if u don't know the difference, u should be watching lupin the third",1387411200,,1517,4.070469798657718

5716580,5,B00CDV4JG0,"Any fan who knows anything about anime knows who Lupin the Third is, but do they truly know about his compatriots? This series is primarily about Fujiko Mine, not Arsene Lupin, as the title implies. The mystery of Fujiko is the main drive for this series, and how she may be tied with a mysterious organization of owl obsessed fanatics. Yes, an owl organization. It sounds absurd, but it works in the confines of this series. In fact, the owl imagery is so unusual and random, it is downright scary.

The first thing a viewer would notice when watching this show is that Fujiko Mine doesn't seem to wear clothes a lot of the time. This is very apparent in the opening and the first few episodes. Because of this, and the dark elements of the story, this is not a series for younger anime fans at all.

Zenigata, Goemon, and Jigen are the other popular Lupin characters that also appear in this series. Their pasts are described finally, and they are particularly different than in the TV series from the 70's. The detective, Zenigata, is the most different from the original series. This time he is actually depicted competently, and not portrayed as a bumbling fool of a detective. There is a new reoccurring character as well. His name is Oscar, a detective that works under Zenigata. He is a very interesting character, but mere mention of the details would spoil any fun that he brings to the show. Episode 6 is where he really gets to shine with some unusual plot twists revolving around him.

The most obvious aspect about the entire show, and the reason that I watched it was the art style. It looks like the show is from the 60's, but it still looks like a new show. The art style look like it is drawn by pencil, much like the original manga. There has not been such an ambitious looking anime since the art style of Gankutsuou.

Fujiko herself is a smart, sexy, and crafty thief, much more than the older series ever portrayed her. This is also the only Lupin series directed by a woman; she also directed the recent anime Michiko and Hatchin. I never saw that anime, but after watching this, I am interested in watching it now.

This release comes with the DVD and Blu Ray discs, much like many of Funimation's recent releases. The English dub is very good too, especially Michelle Ruff and Richard Epcar, who are not normal Funimation actors, but made Fujiko and Zenigata sound really good.",1381017600,16,2402,4.5638051044083525

5716583,5,B00CDV4JG0,"Let me start off by stating Lupin the Third: the Woman Called Fujiko Mine isn't anything like all the previous Lupin series, movies and specials. For starter, this new series is a sexier and slightly darker take on the Lupin we all know and love, at least anime wise for me. Gone are the wacky hijinks and some of the crazy exploits Lupin and company are known for. Of course this is replaced by the much more mature take on Fujiko Mine and Inspector Zenigata. In this series, there's no more innuendos from Fujiko as she is flat out overt in her sexuality.

Lupin the Third: the Woman Called Fujiko is basically a story about how Fujiko becomes who she is and her first encounter of the Lupin gang. This series is all about Fujiko and her secret past while Lupin and company take a back seat. It's a nice departure and is pretty well planned out until the last couple of episodes where I felt they might have rushed the ending a little.

As for everything else, this series was drawn to still resemble the art style of the earlier Lupin series. However, the animation is superb and clean. I also enjoyed the music and thought they did a good job on it. About the only thing wrong with this series is there might have been too much nudity as most of it wasn't really needed to tell the story. The other being the opening sequence basically told you what this series is all about. Oh, as far as the mature theme and darker tone goes, this might have to do with the original manga. I've never read them but have browsed about three or four volumes and from what little I've read, the manga is sexier and darker in tone.

Overall not a bad purchase for me as I enjoyed the series and what little extras this set contains. The main extra is a 26? minute roundtable interview with the English cast and the rest is your typical clean opening/closing and some trailers.",1376870400,6,1862,4.391304347826087

This series is a nice departure from that norm.  Check out the movie ""Gravestone of Daisuke Jigen"" also.  It is very similar to this series with better art budget being a feature.  Both are very cool and a blast to watch.",1501632000,2,368,4.417910447761194

8580542,4,B00CDV4JG0,"I give this AMAZING series 4 stars only because the first half is so much better than the second , but the art and animation style is beyond anything I've seen it's raw, but it's so gorgeous , pretty psychedelic. I absolutely loved the show , I personally haven't seen much else of lupin the 3rd so I can highly recommend this if you haven't seen any of the others it's still quite good and you quickly get to know all the characters within the first few episodes . The first 3 episodes were probably my favorite and the one with the tattooed girl who was being sold as a piece of art",1500768000,,584,4.176991150442478
