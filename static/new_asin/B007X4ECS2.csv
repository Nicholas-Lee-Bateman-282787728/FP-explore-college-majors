8522798,5,B007X4ECS2,It is well done and I found it to be a great help,1520553600,,49,2.8461538461538463
8522799,4,B007X4ECS2,I actually have this dvd it is important to note that this is not for absolute beginners to the guitar but for beginners to blues guitar with that being said if you know a few open position chords and a few scales you should not have too much difficulty navigating through the dvd just coming back to blues after going into jazz for a while.  Danny Gill is a fairly competent instructor and covers the beginning part pretty good you definitely will pick up a few tricks from this dvd if you have not gone through any other extensive blues guitar program,1446249600,,553,4.421568627450981
8522800,2,B007X4ECS2,"Not really geared to beginners, I was hoping clear views of the position of the fingers on the strings & frets. Having tabs available for each lesson would help in practicing the lessons.",1428537600,,187,4.696969696969697
