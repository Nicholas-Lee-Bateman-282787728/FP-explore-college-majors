7847903,5,6303410138,"Very educational video for children, made in the 1990's carefree- flying days of the pre- 9/11 era. It is not a cheesy, over-simplified, and watered-down version of airplanes and airports, but gives enough detail for even the most precocious child.",1483574400,,248,5.225

7847905,5,6303410138,I got this video when it first came out in the 1990's when I was probably 3 or 4.  I am currently I am in my 20s and will still pop this video in ever other month or so.  My favorite film and would highly recommend to any wannabe pilot!,1417392000,,236,3.7
7847906,5,6303410138,"A part of this video was available through our cable company on demand. I got tired of watching the other programs my son always seemed to choose (over and over again) so I put this on hoping it'd be some good. My son loved it! He loved it so much I had to purchase it because he'd ask for it all day long and they'd taken it off cable. Someone had commented their daughter didn't like it and she was disappointed. This video is an educational video. It's not a tv show like Jay Jay the jet plane. It's a way for you to educate your child about whatever they enjoy, that's what the Big Adventure series is. If you've ever owned a video from Small-Fry you'd know that. It's a great alternative for people like me who'd prefer to educate their child instead of just letting them mindlessly watch cartoons over and over again. My son loves this video as well as the Big Train Trip. I'm going to try the construction video and the fire station video. I hope my son enjoys them as well as this one and the Big Plane Trip.",1108512000,4,1016,4.2153846153846155
7847907,5,6303410138,"My son was 3 when he first saw The Big Plane Trip, and since then we have purchased several more titles from the Big Adventure series. Each video is so well presented that adults enjoy watching them along with the children.  They are well filmed and intelligently narrated. I especially like the way  children ask and answer questions on the video. Currently my son is in love  with The Big Airshow. We also have The Big Submarine, The Big Aircraft  Carrier, The Big Zoo, and others. They are pretty much a guaranteed hit,  and grown-ups as well as children come away with more knowledge.",944006400,21,588,4.615384615384615
