8017363,3,B0001WTVN4,"4 movies on 2 double sided DVDs. Hard to tell which side is which, but still a nice idea. The package is a royal pain once open. Rather than a disc on each side there's a loose middle piece that refuses to go back into position so the case doesn't snap closed. The movies have all the film dust & imperfections, the color on The Terror isn't very good, sound has static from the originals, but if you can get past that it's not a bad deal for the price.

""Studs"" is a depression era teen angst movie, not much Jack. ""The Terror"" is a pretty decent tortured Karloff/unlikely hero Jack piece. ""Wild Ride"" is another teen thing... think of a cross between late 70s Tom Waits & Dobie Gillis. ""Shop of Horrors"" is fun, Jack's only in one scene.",1480032000,,739,4.2785714285714285

8017369,4,B0001WTVN4,"CLASSIC JACK 4 Movie Pack offers four public domain films that Jack Nicholson either starred or participated in. Included is one title not in wide circulation (""Studs Lonigan"").

SYNOPSES:

THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS has Jack in a memorable bit part as a pain-loving dental patient. Primarily, this is the zany tale of a flower shop employee and his pet flesh-eating plant. LITTLE SHOP's popularity and cult status continue to grow (flower?) almost 40 years after its debut.

STUDS LONIGAN-- Story of a young man trying to escape Chicago's South Side in the 1920s. A cast member is character actor Jay C. Flippen, who made records in the Roaring 20s as a ukulele playing jazz singer. Also here is The Riddler from TV's ""Batman.""

THE TERROR-- The up-and-comer costars with Boris Karloff. An atmospheric color film somewhat hampered by a rushed production and two directors, THE TERROR feels like two different movies at times. Nicholson is good here as a French officer caught up with a transmogrifying bird and an eccentric old castle dweller.

THE WILD RIDE is Harvey Berman's only directorial job and stars Nicholson as an amateur dirt bike racer who spends his off-track time partying and getting into trouble. Originally 88 minutes, this one was long ago whittled down to an hour. Based on what remains here, little was lost on the cutting room floor.

Two of these Nicholson works were directed by Roger Corman. If you'd like some more Corman, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MASTER-OF-HORROR-4-Movie-Pack/dp/B0000CEROU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MASTER OF HORROR 4 Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;(also from BCI / Eclipse). Included is cult fave ""Bucket of Blood.""

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.

The films featured are:
1.)Studs Lonigan: Jack Nicholson only plays a small part in this movie, but the film is still amazing! The film centers on Bill ""Studs"" Lonigan and his group of friends going nowhere fast in the 1920's Chicago slums. This film is both thought provoking and sad. Lonnigan seems to be victim of his Socio Economic Status, as each year passes and his life is going nowhere.
2.)The Terror: Jack Nicholson plays the starring role in the strange B horror/fantasy movie. Nicholson plays a young officer who finds himself on a strange island. Things take a twist as he follows a strange attractive woman to the castle of an elderly Baron, played by Boris Karloff.
3. The Wild Ride: The best film in this DVD set! Jack Nicholson stars in this 1960s amateur teen film. Nicholson plays Johny Verhan, the cool leader of group of wild teens. This is Jack at his best! He plays chicken with the cops, gets any and all the girls and leads his gang with the snap of his finger.
4.) Little Shop of Horrors: Yes, the original classic version! This silly and stupid B horror flick features Jack nicholson in a small part.
Studs Lonigan=5 stars
The Terror=3 stars
The Wild Ride=4.5 stars
