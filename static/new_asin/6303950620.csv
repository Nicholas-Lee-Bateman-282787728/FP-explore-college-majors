I first saw it when i was 9 years old, and I totally fell in love with Vincent Perez, who played Jeanbaptiste in the movie. 10 years later, the movie is still just as haunting. This is one of Vincent's fist movies, but you can already see that great energy and talent in him. He's a great screen presence,and he steals every scene that he's in.",1060992000,,368,4.271428571428571
7857830,5,6303950620,"Well, despite such reveiws from the noted critics, I thought this film deserved the Best Foreign Film Oscar by far. It caught my eye on television and I almost skipped it, accept for because one scene where Catherine and  her adoptive daughter, Camille started to dance. I was stuck after that. I  couldn't stop watching even though I had to read the subtitles, it never  mattered. Please watch this film, even if the critics thought it ""flat  "" or not Denvenue's ""Best"". I thought she was rather strong  in the role and so were all the other actors. Must see foriegn Film!",961372800,2,573,4.578431372549019
