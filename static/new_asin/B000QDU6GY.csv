8195827,5,B000QDU6GY,Great series of DVDs for those who believe in Creationism or for those who are doubting evolution.  The complexity of the cell and all of creation is beyond question one of evolutions biggest problems.,1435017600,,201,4.911764705882353

8195829,5,B000QDU6GY,"A great four pack that shows both sides of the evolution/intelligent design argument while allowing the intelligent design scientific community a chance to fully voice how the studies of biology, cosmology, and microbiology all support the idea of a Creator.",1369440000,,258,5.475
8195830,5,B000QDU6GY,"Opponents of Intelligent Design theory (IT) fear it precisely because it is NOT literal six-day creationism, and they desparately want to tar it using the same tired and false ""science versus religion"" framework.  If you want to find out just how shaky the Darwinists' ""science"" is - this series will give you a good, accessible introduction.  Years ago, I believed in Darwinism 100 percent, taking it completely on faith - until I was exposed to Phillip Johnson's lectures and books in the early 1990s.  My eyes were opened and I continue to be astonished at how intelligent, educated people swallow Darwinism whole and completely uncritically, despite logical flaws that should be rather obvious.  The intelligent design perspective is refreshing in that, unlike the creationists and evolutionists who are very much alike in their dogmatism, it is motivated to follow the evidence wherever it may lead - eschewing the pre-determined conclusions of the other two camps.",1312588800,,970,5.2387096774193544
8195831,5,B000QDU6GY,"If you want to know the truth, and not the fairytales being spun by evolutionists, this is a good tool to help you become knowledgeable about intelligent design. When you're talking with indoctrinated evolution disciples it gives you answers for their questions.",1312588800,,262,5.261904761904762
8195832,5,B000QDU6GY,"This is an excellent set that I use with my students to show that evolution is old and outdated theory and there is new science showing the intellect in our creation. Also, in ""Icons of Evolution"" we see the mobster tactics Evolutionists employ to keep science from progressing away from Darwinism. In ""The Case of the Creator"" we see multiple atheist scientists that have converted to theists due to the evidence available today. Religion is not a factor in these shows. They give evidence to God using only science and logic. I find them fantastic and my students love them.",1309910400,,576,4.77
8195833,5,B000QDU6GY,"That's all I can say. This set will open your eyes. I was rather skeptical of evolution before, but these DVDs absolutely blew me away. I had no idea there was this much evidence for Intelligent Design and so much against evolution. A definite must see.",1252540800,3,253,4.521739130434782
8195834,5,B000QDU6GY,"Not a replacement for creationism or even a substitute for evolution, IT theory picks up where both have left unanswered questions. IT has been based totally on scientific discipline and researched in such a manner. Few outside in the mainstream community even understand IT, nor know what it is. The public educational system and it's atheistic endorsement, totally opposes IT because it goes against their anti-religion establishment, yet they refuse to refute the faults and serious flaws in Darwinism and faulty textbooks. IT while totally scientific, does lead the subscriber to a metaphysical result and this is what has atheists all in an uproar - because they cannot reconcile science and God. (which is a totally false premise - but that is a side issue.)

These videos clearly explain IT and the hoopla about it. Whether or not you believe or subscribe to IT theory, it does make for a very interesting view. Well done videos, a must for both scientists and philosophers.",1250208000,7,981,5.0184049079754605
8195835,1,B000QDU6GY,"Producing a PBS-style series of documentaries doesn't change the fact that the subject matter is still just plain nonsense. The utter failure of the Intelligent Design movement to produce a single piece of hard, testable data that supports their claims is completely ignored by these films in favor of the same old debunked assertions that have been the stock and trade of creationism for nearly a century. Sadly, as you might expect, the subject is treated as if it is some sort of new and revolutionary concept rather than just good old creationism in a cheap, new suit.

I'm sorry people, but this stuff is both bad science and bad religion. In the decade since the phrase was coined, not only has ""Intelligent Design"" produced no research, no data, no evidence -- no actual science at all, it has also lost in the courts. Even religious organizations actually seeking to fund ID research of some sort have walked away as they discovered there just isn't anything behind the Intelligent Design curtain except the politics of a small minority of Christians. Worse yet, the idea that one would allow their faith to hinge on scientific discoveries of any sort not only undermines the entire concept of faith, but ignores the fact that such thinking is specifically denounced in the Bible itself!

These videos are pretty.

Intelligent Design is not.",1249603200,,1349,4.907894736842105
8195836,3,B000QDU6GY,"Unlocking the mystery of life and Privileged Planet were really good 4.5 stars on those two.  I was some what disappointed in the ""Icons of evolution"".  It was an interesting story of a school teacher's drama in being forced out of teaching because of teaching another perspective in Biology.  However I felt that the content in Icons of evolution could have been much better. I think it is time to do a redo on the Icons of evolution and give more focus to actually refuting in depth the icons of evolution, there is so much more that could have been said.  Having said that I still liked it and feel it is an overall good buy. I would still buy all three knowing what I know.",1199059200,,677,4.349206349206349
