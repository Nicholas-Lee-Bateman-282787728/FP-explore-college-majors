5967600,5,B00F5CQ78C,"I got this set from timelife as a birthday present for myself and this is the way to do it. Lots of extras and great packaging. Last year I got the DARKSHADOWS collection for my birthday. So when I heard MAMAS FAMILY was comming out I couldn't believe it. I agree with the other review, buy the collection on TIMELIFE. To many greedy sellers out there!! I got mine from TIMELIFE!! Update:now that finally you can buy them separately it is better and cheaper to buy them that way. When Mama's Family entire series came out they didn't have the separate seasons. Only season one. I didn't feel like waiting that's why I just purchased the entire collection.",1379462400,23,655,4.559322033898305
5967601,5,B00F5CQ78C,I loved this show so much as a kid and now I'm very happy it has finally came out on dvd to relive these memories. Great show.,1378944000,18,126,3.7037037037037037

5967611,3,B00F5CQ78C,"Season 1 picture was a little less than stellar, but the rest of the seasons were just fine.  My only gripe is seeing the Season 2 disc labeled with a sticker that said Seasons 2-6 are $12.99.  There are six seasons total.  That means I paid over $50 for Season 1...

5 stars for the show, 1 star for the rip off pricing, so I give it 3 stars.",1504915200,2,343,3.927536231884058

5967622,2,B00F5CQ78C,Great collection !  Too bad every set ( received three ) contained scratched and scuffed disks.  The one set I received looks to have been a bundle of individual retail dvds.  I wonder how the newer release is going to be ??  Cant wait to see !!!,1500249600,2,246,4.170212765957447

5967624,5,B00F5CQ78C,"Mama's Family fans have been waiting for this set for a long time! I am so glad I can give those old bootlegs away to someone else as I now own Mama's Family in the highest quality possible.
A few things you should know: the box is HUGE. You probably won't keep it around. The booklets it comes with are neat (mine was even signed by Vicki Lawrence!) but the real treat here is every single episode of Mama's Family. The box you get is filled with individually wrapped DVD cases for seasons 1-6 plus the bonus features. Each DVD also comes with a booklet explaining what's on the disc. It also lists the original air dates for each episode which I thought was super cool.
This show was shot in Standard Definition and it looks fine on an HDTV but prepare yourself for the black bars on the sides as the picture is square shaped and not rectangular like all of our new fancy high def TVs. You can probably stretch the picture but I'd rather it look normal rather than stretched. It doesn't bother me a bit.
I am super happy with my purchase and now I have Mama forever!",1499731200,2,1068,4.292079207920792

5967659,5,B00F5CQ78C,Amazing price for this entire set.  Obviously it is not HD quality as it is an old show and wasn't filmed that way.  The quality is not a reason to pass up owning every episode of this classic show.  It's no different than watching it on TV.  Under $100 for an entire series of a classic show is definitely a bargain.,1470096000,,317,4.147540983606557

5967682,4,B00F5CQ78C,"I highly recommend ""Mama's Family:  The Complete Collection.""  The set includes all 130 episodes plus a bonus 2-part DVD and a booklet with information about the characters.  A brief episode guide is included in the liner notes of each case.  Some have a very brief plot description but others simply list the episodes.  What I would have liked is a detailed episode guide.  I didn't find the booklet interesting and had no hesitation about tossing it, along with the bulky oversize box containing the DVD's.  We keep our DVD's in soft-sided binders for easy storage.

Other reviewers have mentioned that these episodes are ""cut"" for syndication.  To me it's not that important.  What matters is that I finally have all of Mama.

Edited to add that I found an error in one of the titles.  The last episode of Season 2 is entitled ""A Great Mistake"" on the DVD label.  It should be ""A Grave Mistake"".  I have verified this with several online episode guides.",1455667200,5,956,4.715151515151515
5967683,3,B00F5CQ78C,"Show is wonderful but this price and what Amazon continues to INTENTIONALLY do with these prices is absolutely wrong period.

What I received was ""The Mama's Family FAVORITES Collection"" which turns out to be 37 episodes ""hand picked by Mama"" on 6 discs. Needless to say I am going to return this and order the complete series but not from here because it is drastically overpriced. I love this show but extremely disappointed in how this was presented, it is totally misrepresented here. So be careful and make sure of what you are ordering.",1450656000,8,569,4.533980582524272

5967693,1,B00F5CQ78C,"I purchased this from another online retailer at a discount price. The product arrived as pictured. My issue is with the 'quality' of the episodes. If you have a small TV, you'll probably not notice it - but with my 49"" tv, most of the beginning episodes (seasons 1 & 2) are hard to watch because of the poor picture quality. They 'warn' you of this in the beginning of each dvd - but truth is - I don't think they even tried to remaster it. I have episodes of this show I recorded on VHS back in the 90s on TV that have better quality than these. That's pretty bad.

I must say to all potential buyers - DO NOT ORDER THIS SET! It's VASTLY overpriced and lacking in quality in a major way.",1444521600,7,689,4.103703703703704

Most excessively frustrating packaging ever. It's too awkwardly sized and proportioned to put anywhere but still to nice to toss. It's also really frustrating dealing with all that packaging to change discs.

Let me just say that, although I paid about $80 more for my set, I have no regrets! This is one show that you can watch over and over and over and it never gets old! I just wish that there were more seasons! This show should have ran atleast 9 seasons, and had the network not moved it around so much in the time slots, it likely would have! But, needless to say, I am so happy to finally have it on DVD! The Golden Girls, Mama's Family, & Maude are 3 of my favorite collections. TV today is mostly garbage, so it is nice to have the shows from the good old days, to go back in time. Buy this set! Y",1429142400,,709,3.965034965034965
5967718,5,B00F5CQ78C,"This is awesome!  We have fond memories of watching this from time to time when we were younger.  Seeing these episodes--in full and in order--now is a real treat.  There are some things that might not make sense to today's younger set--rotary phones, the big deal of getting a VHS player, typewriters, the fascination with Charles and Di, etc...  However, there is more than enough that rings true for every generation.

The extras are much appreciated.  Interviews with just about everybody, original sketches from The Carol Burnett Show, and the reunion are great.  There's even the ""Eunice"" movie included.  Watching the show, you get the feeling that the actors were really enjoying themselves when they made the series.  The interviews confirm that feeling!

There is one warning.  If you start watching the first season, you will keep watching for days on end until you finish the series--and then probably go back to the beginning episodes again!  This is definitely a ""binge watching"" show, as Rick Hawkins put it.  Every episode is so well done, so entertaining and so interesting that you just get reeled in.

Well worth the price.  These DVDs will be used over and over.",1428969600,17,1182,4.928934010152284

5967731,1,B00F5CQ78C,"People this COMPLETE collection is a total ripoff.

The truth of the matter is no amount of these extras make up for the hatchet job they did on this show.

Its come to my attention recently that half these episodes are the edited syndicated versions not the uncut versions originally broadcast.

The fact that these companies nowadays continue to give the fans the proverbial shaft is flat out pathetic.

This is ridiculous and its not right in any capacity.

They always make excuses about copyrights but the truth is they simply do not care enough to make the fans happy and that's the sad truth of the matter.

If you buy this prepare yourself because most of the episodes are the edited versions which means certain parts are taken out.

For example the episode where Mama spends the day by herself they have intentionally cut out the scene where she is outside jumping in a puddle singing Singing in the Rain .

Its ridiculous that for a song that is that old they conveniently were unable to get access to it for that specific episode.

So over this what is the point of even buying these complete collections when that is FALSE ADVERTISING to begin with?

Pathetic and Amazon is ripping off its customers with these ridiculous prices for tv series sets that are either cut to shreds edited have scenes intentionally removed or music has been changed .

This is shameful on Amazons part and the people who distributed these complete collections and separate dvds individually as well.

Save your money you can still find Mamas family online to watch unedited.",1423699200,18,1566,4.716911764705882

5967741,5,B00F5CQ78C,"Loved this show. I remember it airing in sydication on weekends in the late 80s. I always tried to watch it and I LOVED Iola. Later, reruns aired on TBS and I got to see the first 2 seasons. Frankly, I like the syndicated version better - but I still loved the first 2 seasons. Perhaps it's because I actually saw the syndicated version first and THEN the first seasons later. Some sitcoms are just so re-watchable to me and this is one of them. I can't count how many times I've seen the episodes. This is cheaper on Amazon now than at Time Life, by 80 dollars! Kinda of strange but whatever...

I think my most favorite episode is ""Soup to Nuts"" where Iola goes off the deep end twice. It's hysterical. There are two episodes where she has to go outside and scream! LOL -

This set also comes with a bonus disc with interviews and such but in my opinion all these extras could have been ported over throughout the seasons rather than giving them there own disc and jacket, to me that's a waste of space. The main reason I gave this set 4 stars and not 5 was the packaging. When I received this in the mail I was taken aback at how HUGE it was. COMPLETLY unnecessary. Murder she wrote which has 12 seasons..which is double this at 6 is packaged more compactly. The box that houses this set of 6 seasons is just bulky and odd!

I have always been a huge fan and it doesn't matter how many times I see an episode because I always find something to laugh about or commiserate with. I thought perhaps I was missing out on something after reading the reviews. There were complaints that StarVista made cuts that TimeLife did not. So I went to timelife.com and found the huge StarVista logo affiliated with TimeLife as well as complaints about cuts made in the episodes. I agree that when something says complete there should be no cuts but I am going to finish my collection when season 6 comes out and enjoy my time at Mama's house without worrying about what's been cut.,1411776000,3,743,4.511111111111111

First thing I noticed is that the quality of the video is horrible. way lower then 480p. Maybe because they just try to fit so many episodes into one disc?
