8422818,5,B004C5NYYI,One of the best comedy routines I've seen in years. Right up there with SNL. These kids are going to be stars. I see that one of them is already to star in a movie here in the USA this summer. Excellent comedy for those familiar with English humor with is a little darker then ours. This is a great buy.,1375228800,,303,3.9836065573770494
8422819,3,B004C5NYYI,"""School of Comedy"" is a sketch show for adults, preformed by a group of British teenagers aged from the ranges of 13 to 17 or so. I know that may sound strange to some that it's a bunch of kids preforming these sketches, but it is made from an adult audience. If you are wondering if it's just a cheap way to try and sell something that sounds cute, think again. These kids are playing adult parts, talking, swearing, cussing and doing adult comedy material about just about anything.

A few reoccurring characters are a perverted Italian security officer in an art museum whom is obsessed with naked art. A couple of guys sitting in a van and hollering sexist remarks at female passers by. A wartime story of two lesbians and her gay husband who is oblivious to them being lesbians. Quirky medics and a tonne more.

This sketch show is a lot better than current SNL, because SNL keeps thinking kids will watch it and so they will not swear or push the envelope anymore, and wonder why no one watches it anymore? But if you have heard of another show called WonderShowzen, then this show here will seem very tame compared to how far that show did push children for an adult audience.

For the most part the sketches are funny, a few hit and miss, but every 2nd one makes up for the last one and so forth... it's still better than watching SNL these days and laughing maybe once or twice somewhere between the season opener and end of season wrap up. However a few of the sketches in this show can get pretty repetitive, especially the stupid lip sync singing that ends every show. That really became annoying, since the first episode it was annoying actually, I found myself reaching for the remote to skip all the dumb singing stuff. If a cut version was released where the sync singing was cut out completely, i'd rate this DVD release 1 star more, but unfortunately it's still on DVD as it was shown on air in it's uncut form.",1354752000,,1929,4.443502824858757
