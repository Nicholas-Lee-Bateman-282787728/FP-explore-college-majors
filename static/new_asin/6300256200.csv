279015,5,6300256200,"Poor Anna.  Her father was Jack the Ripper.  He may be deceased but his evil spirit lives on in her.  Her hands have become his hands, and he forces her to kill and kill again.  The ""Hands of the Ripper"" is a superb piece of gothic horror from Hammer Production.  A well crafted chiller, it offers suspense while following a trail of gruesome stabbing deaths.  With each bloody corpse, the psychiatrist who is determined to treat her becomes one step closer to knowing the truth, but will it be too late to save him and his family?

  ""Hands of the Ripper"" isn't available on DVD in America.  Fortunately, there is the Portuguese import released by Editora.  The video and audio are crisp and clear, as good as any Hammer Production I've seen from Anchor Bay.  Optional English subtitles are available.  A trailer is also available but it has Portuguese subtitles that are not optional.  My only issue with the DVD is that the film abruptly ends halfway through the credits.  I don't know if that happens on my copy only or on all of them.

  ""Hands of the Ripper"" from Editora is highly recommended if you are a fan of Hammer Production, a fan of gothic horror, a fan of Jack the Ripper or, if you are like me, a fan of all three.",1217894400,,1231,4.419642857142857
279016,5,6300256200,"'Hands of the Ripper' is a Hammer movie from Peter Sasdy; the same guy who directed the lamentable 'I Don't Want To Be Born' and it's in a different league.
Superior in every multitudinous way you can possibly think of, and then some...

It's a sharp, aggressive picture. A slight departure for Hammer, in that there's a VERY sympathetic 'monster'. Not an unthinking fiend from the murk and fog, but a vulnerable and frightened young girl: Anna.

Traumatized by an unspeakable horror from her childhood, conditioned by years of abuse and then hidden away. Forced to participate in her guardian's shameful exploiting of recently bereaved people in her fraudulent role as a medium.

That she snaps will come as no surprise. The trigger, something as innocent as a kiss, provokes the most horrendous violence as she becomes possessed by her father's murderous spirit and continues his trail of destruction.

Her father is none other than Victorian bogeyman Jack the Ripper. In 'HOTR's pre-credit sequence we see a hysterical Anna in her cot, witnessing her own mother's ghastly death at the hands of her scarred and blood stained father. Sowing the seeds of the inevitable carnage that follows....

Later, she's taken into the care of a kindly doctor, played excellently by old Soames himself - Eric Porter. Who, as an early advocate of Freud(the only thing he doesn't do is say ""Ja ?""(!)), both suspects the evil in Anna, but thinks he can help her with psycho-analysis.
An opinion not shared by nasty politician (is there any other kind?) Dysart who believes the only cure for her is ""a good, stout rope about her neck"".
As it turns out, in Sasdy terms anyway, this would undoubtedly have been the wisest course of action.

There's some brilliantly unpleasant low-budget killings, including a jaw-dropping hat-pins-in-the-eye demise. and the film roars along like a leopard on fire - cramming all sorts of ideas and subversions across it's superbly compact 85 minutes.

Performances are exceptional. The fine Welsh actress Angharad Rees is marvellous as Anna, giving an understated interpretation. On one hand, ferocious, eyes-ablaze and ruthless - on the other - a child. Lost and innocent with no comprehension of whats happening to her or the devastation she's causing either in her own environment, or on the foggy, corrupt streets of Victorian London(itself a ruthless, hypocritical monster - a theme explored just as bitingly in Sasdy's previous 'Taste the Blood of Dracula').

Despite it's lurid title, this is a serious, complex thriller with many facets and is unmissable if you're in any way a fan of the Hammer ouvre in particular, or horror pictures generally.",1216857600,5,2671,5.054545454545455
279017,5,6300256200,"This is probably one of Hammer studios lesser known films.  Made in the 1970's, when the studio was on the decline.  This might not be the most historically accurate portrayal of the 1888 Whitechapel murders, but is still a good horror movie.  Some gory murder scenes in this one.
Another movie that hasn't seen a region 1 release. :(",1195344000,2,334,4.627118644067797
279018,5,6300256200,"Hands of the Ripper is a shockingly neglected and obscure little atmospheric masterpiece from Hammer Studios.  It's a veritable showcase of classic horror at its best, with several somewhat bloody scenes thrown in for good measure.  Beautifully shot and scored, the film simply oozes the aura of Victorian London, and the cinematography of the final shot is, ahem, to die for.  The entire cast is wonderful, particularly Eric Porter and Angharad Rees, the latter being a delightful young actress I had never encountered before.

I know you're probably wondering if the film is about Jack the Ripper.  Well, yes and no.  The story is ostensibly about his daughter.  You can imagine how screwed up in the head a daughter of Saucy Jack might be; now imagine that this little girl saw her father murder her mother right in front of her eyes.  Freud would have wet himself over such a poor, young thing.  Now a young lady, we find Anna working as a fraudulent medium's secret little helper.  The madam isn't above selling Anna's body to certain gentlemen, either.  Following a ""s&eacute;ance"" attended by the good Dr. Pritchard (Eric Porter) and others, no less than a man of Parliament (Derek Godfrey) stays behind to indulge in some special favors.  A scream later, Pritchard has run back into the house (encountering the fleeing Parliamentarian at the door) to find Anna in a somewhat catatonic state and the medium quite dead.  You would think Pritchard would accuse the man he saw fleeing the house at the time of the murder, but he has plans of his own.  Having grown fascinated with the breakthrough work of Freud in Vienna, Pritchard thinks he can cure the girl (if she does turn out to be the murderer) and, at the same time, finally acquire the answers as to why people commit murder in the first place.

Having brought Anna home with him, Pritchard finds her to be the meekest of creatures, a veritable delight to be around.  If it weren't for her bad habit of killing people for no good reason, she would be a beacon of female virtue.  In her defense, she is quite unaware of her murderous actions, as she falls into something of a trance each time the violence rises up in her.  Pritchard, not yet knowing the facts of her childhood, believes her to be schizophrenic, but more than one character ultimately voices the opinion that Jack the Ripper himself possesses her body whenever a certain stimulus causes her to break with reality.  Either way, Dr. Pritchard has bought himself some trouble - and just days away from his son's marriage, too.

OK, the plot is a little less than perfect, but I loved this movie.  You just can't beat Hammer Studios when it comes to producing old school horror films heavy on suspense and characterization.  Those looking for quick bloody thrills should probably look elsewhere, as this film's rather limited gore is sprinkled here and there throughout the film, but those who appreciate horror in all its facets should be particularly impressed with this overlooked 1971 Hammer Studios gem.",1191196800,11,3034,4.805394990366088
279019,5,6300256200,"Welcome to Hammer's outstanding ""Hands of the Ripper"", one of the studio's last movies and one of their best. The story tells of Anna, a young girl who is actually Jack the Ripper's daughter, and who was traumatised as a toddler by witnessing a vicious killing (seen in the prologue). Now an adult, she is prone to murderous seizures which provide the many grisly highlights of the film. It sounds rather lurid, but the film takes the subject seriously, and as a whole, the plot is tremendously engaging. Anna's rages are only triggered by a specific set of circumstances, and the script creates a surprising and clever staging for each one, following on every time with a suitably gory slaughter. The film features great performances from its prestigious cast, particularly Angharad Rees who is luminously beautiful as Anna, and Eric Porter as the doctor who realises her identity but is compelled to try and cure her rather than turn her in (as well as falling for her charms, as she has no recollection of what she does when she goes into a trance). Of course, in the movies such a situation can only end in tragedy, and the climax of the story is elegantly downbeat and very effective. The period London setting, the photography and the directing all fall perfectly into place, and ""Hands of the Ripper"" can be judged as one of Hammer's greatest acheivements. It's crying out for a DVD release, so hopefully someone will take the initiative very soon. There is a UK region 2 release, but it's only available as a box set with two far inferior British 70's horror movies ""The Monster"" and ""The Uncanny"". I was lucky and got one from a split set, but it's a real shame that most people will miss out on enjoying this movie by it not getting the circulation it deserves.",1086566400,21,1771,4.661341853035144

279101,5,6300256200,"""It's the Ripper!""  There's nothing more welcoming than an angry mob with torches.  Fortunately, the Ripper makes it home before the mob catches him.  Unfortunately, his wife realizes too late, ""it's you they're looking for!""  Never confront a man wielding a very big knife he obviously knows how to use.

Years later, the Ripper's traumatized daughter (Angharad Rees) starts wrecking havoc of her own.  She's lucky though to have the interest of a do-gooder doctor (Eric Porter) anxious to try out Freud's theories.  He's more interested in why she murders than the people she murders.  To that end, he not only protects her, he cleans up after her.  After all, it's not her fault she murders wantonly, there has to be a reason.  In this case, shiny objects and a kiss are enough to set her off.  Soon, the body count mounts.  When she gets a bit too close to a familial connection, the dopey doctor reluctantly concedes that he didn't serve anyone's best interests when he allowed her to roam free, killing willy-nilly.  This is a case of a bad experiment getting way out of hand.  Malpractice anyone?

I loved this movie.  It was very stylish, the acting was a great asset, the plot was interesting, and there was almost plenty of gore (there's always room for more).",1443139200,,1270,4.730593607305936

279132,3,6300256200,"I have been a huge fan of Hammer Films since the 1960s.  I have all that are available on DVD and Blu-Ray.  In 1971 I was managing a movie theater while going to college.  I remember playing HANDS OF THE RIPPER for a weekend and my opinion of it now is the same as it was then when it was first released.

I found it to be one of the weakest of the Hammer features while, sadly being one of their last.

Although, like all gothic Hammers, it is an excellent period piece with high production values and wonderful costuming - two of the hallmarks of the studio.

What I found lacking in this film was mainly any known stars - no Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee and none of the outstanding character actors Hammer was so famous for like Michael Ripper or Thorley Walters nor do we have any of the many Hammer female stars like Veronica Carlson or Ingrid Pitt.  Instead we have Eric Porter as a well-meaning psychiatrist who takes in Anna the daughter of Jack The Ripper.  Anna was played by late and then basically little-known Angharad Rees who delivers a bland performance.

Also, the story was rather weak and seemed quite slow in places.  And somehow when Anna kills anyone, now matter in how much of a place of prominence, no one seems to be able to put two and two together and realize that she was the last one to be seen with the victims.

As far as the Blu-Ray transfer itself, it is definitely NOT high definition.  The color is washed out and faded and the image is overly grainy.  For a Blu-Ray, it ends up looking no better than the old Thorn/EMI VHS release version of this film from the 1980s.  The extra features hold little or nothing interesting.  THE EVOLUTION OF HAMMER GORE is not a featurette but merely a hodgepodge of still photographs from several Hammer releases - most are in lackluster black and white.

While many people like this film, I find it only worth owning to complete my Hammer collection.  Hammer had done a much better take of the Jack The Ripper legend with its earlier 1971 classic DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE with Hammer stalwarts Ralph Bates and Martine Beswick.",1386979200,3,2104,4.4516971279373365

279136,5,6300256200,"I didn't see HANDS on its original release in 1971 as part of a double bill with TWINS OF EVIL although I did see the latter coupled with a different movie. During my college years I haunted the drive-ins in search of Hammer and Euro-Gothic horror films but tastes were changing. The giallo films of Dario Argento and others began to take hold and inexorably the films became more graphic and contemporary. I was a big Jack the Ripper fan having seen the 1959 film of the same name and the 1965 A STUDY IN TERROR where John Neville's Sherlock Holmes did battle with him. 1979's MURDER BY DECREE  with Christopher Plummer & James Mason became (and still is) my favorite Ripper film. TIME AFTER TIME was fun and FROM HELL had its moments but I kept wanting to see this one. Try as I might though, I could not get my hands on a copy of HANDS and I never had the opportunity to catch it on TV.

A few years ago I obtained a Region 2 copy and was pleasantly surprised by how lavish the film looked and shocked at how violent it was. The lead performances by Eric Porter (after FORSYTE SAGA) and Angharad Rees (before POLDARK) showed a depth I wasn't used to in a Hammer release and the ending was truly remarkable. It quickly became my favorite Hammer film. This new Blu-Ray/DVD combo by Synapse Films is not only welcome, but it's an improvement on the old one. The DVD is better but the Blu-Ray is truly stunning. Not only is the picture quality top notch but the extra features including the featurette on Hammer producer Aida Young was fascinating and helped to explain a lot regarding Hammer's later films. I won't go into the story as so many other reviews have but if you love period horror especially Hammer's brand of it then this one is a must for your collection.

279205,5,6300256200,"Back in 2010, a number of film websites announced that Synapse Films acquired the negatives of the elusive three Hammer Film titles which were much sought after by collectors.  'HANDS OF THE RIPPER', 'TWINS OF EVIL' and 'VAMPIRE CIRCUS' all released in 1970 were the only titles not available on Digital transfers .  Available in the 90's on imported Laser Discs or VHS copies, these were the severely edited versions released to US theaters and were not seen since their original theatrical runs in Europe.  Well, Synapse kept to their word and released one film each summer restoring the films to their most complete running times culminating in this last title Director Peter Sasdy's 'HANDS OF THE RIPPER', a different type of Ripper film and which emerges as Hammer's most tragic and poignant film in its repertoire.  Heavily hyped as one of the company's most gruesome titles, it shows how Hammer was particularly scrutinized by the critics for its use of gory set pieces yet US grind house and Drive-in theaters were flooded with European Giallo and exploitation films showing far worse than Hammer ever conjured. It is wonderful that Synapse has allowed audiences that have never experienced the film before to see it for what it truly is, an exercise in psychological terror utilizing a Pygmalion motif and serial killer theme predating the Slasher film cycle by almost a decade.  It does boast an excellent cast headed by Eric Porter playing the medical doctor, Jane Merrow as a handicapped heroine and in an outstanding performance, Angharad Rees as Anna, the daughter of Jack The Ripper. The film is one of Hammer's best and show the direction the studio could have taken if not for the fan hunger for another Dracula/Frankenstein release and more gore along with it. Bonus features includes a 28 minute featurette 'THE DEVIL'S BLOODY PLAYTHING-POSSESSED BY HANDS OF THE RIPPER showing the evolution of the film and a brief history of its Producer Aida Young with interviews by many writers and actress Jane Merrow and Director Peter Sasdy.  Unfortunately, Angharad Rees passed away in 2012 but their is an audio interview with her which is interspersed throughout the featurette.  There is a startling motion still gallery of rare images called 'SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENCE-THE EVOLUTION OF HAMMER GORE' which highlights the studios gorier moments from their library of titles, the US 1976 Television introduction which was filmed to fill up the running time due to the excessive cuts to the print, a stills gallery for the film, original trailers and TV spots , and an isolated music and effects track only found on the Blu-Ray disc and which gets you to appreciate composer Christopher Gunning's hauntingly underrated score.  The Blu-Ray is in a gorgeous 1.85 1080P transfer with not a blemish or speckle to be found with a DTS-HD MA English 2.0 mono track.  This film along with the other Hammer titles belongs in every Horror fans library and hats off to Synapse for fulfilling their promise and  allowing audiences to appreciate this underrated title from Hammers heyday.",1373932800,16,3083,5.015655577299413

279209,5,6300256200,"I had not even known of this movie's existence until Chip Kaufmann, a reviewer specializing in the classic horror genre recommended it to me. Luckily, the movie rental website I subscribe to had this and I was very pleased with the movie. The production qualities are above average and overall, I thought this was one of Hammer's better productions, a wonderful blend of classic horror and excellent acting.

The movie's plot has a unique premise - what if Jack the Ripper had a daughter, and this same daughter witnessed her mother's death at Jack's hands, and was so traumatized by the childhood experience that it haunted her into adulthood? There is of course a supernatural element in the story that involves spirit possession. Anna (Angharad Rees) portrays the young and innocent girl who having been orphaned at a young age, is being used as part of a fake psychic's seance business. The old psychic also plans to sell Anna's virginity to a prominent sleaze-bag, an aspiring politician Dysart (Derek Godfrey). Things go horribly awry and the psychic is murdered. The only witnesses are Anna and Dysart. Here's where the other main character comes in - Dr. Pritchard (Eric Porter) is a prominent psychiatrist who wishes to study the roots of violent behavior and finds Anna a compelling subject. He manages to extricate both Dysart (who fears for his reputation) and Anna (who has been thrown into a women's lock-up facility) out of a potentially sticky situation and harbors Anna in his home.

Well, things get complicated further when Pritchard's son, Michael (Keith Bell) and his blind wife-to-be Laura (Jane Merrow) come to stay. There is something obviously not quite right with Anna, but even Pritchard does not realize how dangerous the situation can be for him and all those he loves. I thought the story was well-paced - there's an element of suspense throughout, and the menacing atmosphere is well conveyed through the use of lighting and of course the credible acting, especially by Rees' portrayal of the confused and tormented Anna and Porter's well-intentioned but ultimately clueless Pritchard. This movie is recommended for fans of classic and atmospheric horror, but if you're expecting a story along the lines of those splatterfest horror movies  with little in terms of plot and characterization, this is not for you.

Hopefully, I'll be able to find a decent DVD of this classic horror movie and add it to my collection. Recommended! Other Ripper-themed movies I'd recommend:

279210,5,6300256200,"The other reviews are good. Trouble right now is that the DVD is becoming unavailable. This import is spoken in English, don't worry, and subtitles can be turned off. It's the full wide screen. The end credits are cut short before the music stops, which spoils that mood, but not ""in the middle of the credits"". There's a bit of nudity with Rees.
The title may mislead people into thinking it's a cheap gore film. No, it's a literate masterpiece, and based on a serious novel.",1257465600,2,476,4.546511627906977
279211,5,6300256200,"Another horror production from Hammer studios in England which details the story of the daughter of Jack the Ripper who continues his murderous rampage after she becomes a young adult. She witnesses the murder of her mother as a young child and is traumatized by the experience and becomes a possessed killer when the memories from her father's actions are triggered by a bright shining light and a kiss. The murder scenes are a little graphic (especially the eye gouging scene). Angharad Rees (of Poldark fame) plays the possessed daughter of Jack the Ripper. Her exceptional performance displays a young innocent woman who doesn't comprehend the underpinnings of suppressed murderous tendencies. The role of Dr. Pritchard who tries to understand the young women's psychological background and how she got that way is well played by Eric Porter. As Dr. Pritchard tries to shield the young woman from her killings, in the end he realizes that it might all have been a futile endeavor on his part.",1246233600,,996,5.006024096385542

7807445,5,6300256200,"A good transfer on the Synapse Films Blu-ray for Hammer's late film, ""Hands of the Ripper"".  The extras on here are high quality, as expected from the company.  They are, however, relatively short compared to other releases such as ""Twins of Evil.""  The ending is quite stylistic, and it is a pity that (like pretty much all Hammer films) quality is sacrificed for the sake of the budget.  It somehow reminds me of The Godfather Trilogy at the end, it is almost operatic, but also cobbled together.  You'll just have to watch it yourself to judge it, but entertainment value is not in doubt.",1504310400,,591,4.644230769230769

this is something you gotta watch if your either interested in the killings of Jackie (please don't take this weirdly) or a good British movies of classic style. I mean the dude that acts the main doctor is the most elegant motherlover in the world!!!",1480550400,,307,4.6
7807449,5,6300256200,"I remember seeing Hands of the ripper over 10 years ago on dvd
which had lots of scenes cut out mainly the killing scenes it must've been the region 2 dvd i watched
well Synapse has now reissued it on blu-ray now and can you believe it it's the Uncut version to
Synapse got the rights to the Unrated version which had lots more Blood & Gore footage
i watched some of killing scenes pretty Damn brutal especially for a 1971 film Definitely pre Halloween
no wonder why the BBC (British board censors) cut out the extra Gore scenes before the film was released to Cinemas
the new 1:66:1 HD transfer looks fantastic very nice sharp & clear picture
the 1:66:1 ratio does have black pillars/bars on either side of my Widescreen TV the black bars are only 1 inch thick if that
so they're hardly noticeable
the sound quality is very Good 2.0 master stereo mix
EXTRAS, new retrospective featurette THE DEVILS BLOODY PLAYTHING -30mins
new interviews with Director Peter sasdy, Actress Jane merrow who plays the blind woman in the film
there's also some comments by Angharad rees who played young Anna in the film
but it's only Audio comments about her role in the film her interview must've been Done over the phone
also interviews with Film critic Kim newman, Director Joe Dante and others
there's also Stills Photo Gallery new 1080p quality Photos from the films Production
plus original trailer, TV spots, the U.S. TV introduction
the DVD Disc has the same content as the blu-ray only difference is the picture quality Disc 1 is HD Disc 2 is only Digital remaster
the film goes for 85min Unrated so 5 stars for this new blu-ray reissue",1480464000,3,1628,4.617241379310345

7807453,5,6300256200,What a find. The last major production by Hammer filmed at Pinewood Studios. Atmospheric and interesting plot twist. The ending filmed with photographic backdrops of Saint Paul's Cathedral is worth the price of the film by itself.,1444953600,,230,5.243243243243243
