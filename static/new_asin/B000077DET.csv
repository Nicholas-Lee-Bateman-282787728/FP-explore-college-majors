7974098,4,B000077DET,"You know everyone loves dolphins.  Tuna cans says ""Dolphin free.""  One ""Lethal Weapon"" installment had Danny Glover's family making sure to avoid dolphin-killing products.  Even Elian Gonzales hoped his mother was saved by a dolphin.
This work doesn't even mention the Amazon dolphin until one-third of the way into it.  Their overall point is that the whole Amazon is being destroyed, but by using a cute dolphin they really get my American attention, and I imagine that other watchers in developed nations would feel the same way.  At one point, a zookeeper is being interviewed and the Amazon dolphin seems to be looking into the camera too.  It makes it seem childlike, or as if it too was interested in being a celebrity like reality show contestants are.
The work says the endangerment of these creatures are caused by many types of people.  Europeans were the first to hunt and kill it.  However, indigenous people sell its oil as a love potion.  African people use its teeth as a good luck charm.  Perhaps all types of people can unite to save the animal.
The work shows former Peruvian president Fujimori signing a bill to protect the animal.  However, it never says his name, nor mentions that critics have said he was corrupt.
In the same way that I am a sucker for the manatees in my own country, I think many will fall in love with this underwater mammal in South America.  By the way, the dolphin is cuter than what is pictured on the cover of this tape.",1189814400,,1468,4.625482625482626
