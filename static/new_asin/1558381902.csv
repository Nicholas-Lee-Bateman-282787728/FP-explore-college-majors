180204,1,1558381902,"This video, while very detailed and full of accurate information just wasn't what I was looking for.  The South Kaibab and the Bright Angel trails kicked my tail ... I was looking for something that would show what I felt when I hiked them.  I will hike them again.  I don't want to die knowing I got whipped that bad by those two trails.",1011744000,3,338,4.25
180205,5,1558381902,I like the author of this video hiked through the GC for the first time in 1993 and was hooked.  I have returned many times since always finding something new just below the rim.  I can say easily that the canyon changed my life and my view of the world around me.  This video comes the closest to showing to the world that world below the rim that hikers find.  I think that anyone who is interested in hiking there should definitely see this video.  It gives the most information on geology and trail conditions I have seen in any video (even the one from the backcountry office).  I give this video the highest rating because I believe from my own experience that it deserves it!,985132800,7,682,4.373015873015873
180206,5,1558381902,"The footage in this video covers more beautiful scenes from the Grand Canyon than all but a handful of people on earth will ever see.  In addition, you get valuable geological and topographical information that will make your hike more interesting and memorable.  Having this video also saves you the trouble of shooting your own footage (and carrying your own video equipment).  Finally, the hiking information is relevant to preparing to make your hiking at the Grand Canyon exactly what you want it to be.
If you are like most people (99 percent of them anyway), you will come to the Grand Canyon, ooh and aah a little from the rim, and go to the next place on your trip.  This video will give you many of the views that can only be seen by hiking down.  So you can get a lot of benefit from very little effort.  That's a very good deal.
Before going on, I want to also praise this video for choosing to cover all three main trails to the Colorado River from the north and south rims.  Even those who hike the Canyon will seldom do all three of these trails.  I got useful ideas about the potential benefits of doing the two trails I have not yet hiked.  In addition, the computer graphics in this video are simply outstanding and make the narration much more meaningful.
I have only two quibbles about the video.  I found Jeannine McNamara's voice as narrator a little hard to listen to.  The narration script does a good job of describing the dangers of doing these hikes (dehydration, falling, heat prostration and stroke, flash floods, rapid currents in the Colorado, and being hit by rocks), but I thought these were repeated a little too often.
Let me tell you a little about my experience hiking the Bright Angel Trail, so that you will realize why you will benefit form this video.  I had first come to the trail as an adult with my two sons when they were young.  My older son, then 5, wanted to hike down a little.  He and I loved it, but it scared me because he wasn't really old enough to be careful.  I promised him we would come back someday.  We did not return until 20 years later.  Hoping to make the experience something special, my wife arranged for a special early morning tour by a park ranger.  That tour gave us a lot of background that is not in the video.  I highly recommend doing this.  The fee is well worth it, but there is limited time for rangers to do this.  You have to schedule well in advance.  Part of the tour included hiking down about 500 vertical feet on the Bright Angel trail.  When it was time to go back up, my older son and I looked at each other and said, ""We're going to go a little further.""  The ranger with us warned us that on a July day it was really too late to be getting started to hike the whole trail, and briefed us on what else we needed to do about food and water while encouraging us to stop before it got too hot.  We followed the directions (similar to those on the video) and had a magnificant hike.  We spent the heat of the afternoon resting in the shade at the bottom, and hiked back up to finish just before sunset.  This was one of the best days of my life, and made fantastic a memory that my son and I will treasure forever.  I intend to share this video with him tomorrow night to help us recall our wonderful time together.  The material on the video exactly matches what we saw, down to the big-horned sheep and deer we passed on the trail.
We were pretty impressed with ourselves for doing this until a 74 year old man and a 12 year old boy passed us going up just before dusk.  They had started by flashlight at 3 a.m. and had been down the Bright Angel Trail and on to the base of the North Rim and back in one day.  I suddenly realized that I needed to come back and hike the Canyon again with my grandchildren in about another 20 years.
If you are like me, hiking the Canyon will be one of the high points of your life.  Be sure to take those you love with you (or at least as many as you can persuade after showing them this video).  Plan ahead.  Everything takes reservations months ahead, including staying in the park so you can get an early start.  The video will tell you what to do.
After you have enjoyed your hike, I suggest you think about other places where the grandeur of nature can provide a wonderful hiking experience that fits with your interests and physical abilities.  Plan you next family hike today!
See the world up close!",972950400,27,4427,4.291566265060241
180207,5,1558381902,"Hiking the Grand Canyon is not only an assest but a necessity for anyone drawn to the beauty and mystery of this natural wonder.  It is obvious from the presentation that much time and thought went into creating such a practical guide.  Detailed computer graphics, picturesque video, and a superbly performed voice-over of all information make this video as enjoyable as it is useful.  Five stars!  Here's hoping the creators will search out other US trails and parks to present to the populace.  As an east-coaster, I'd like to suggest the Appalachian Trail.",970012800,6,559,4.967741935483871
180208,5,1558381902,"This video is a great resource for anyone who would like to hike the Grand  Canyon.  It provides basic information about the canyon, its geography, its  weather and its dangers.  Everything is presented in very understandable  language with plenty of computer graphics and video images.  If you have  never hiked the canyon, this tells you how to go about it with lots of  helpful hints, useful tips and precautions.  It includes detailed  descriptions of the three main trails.
If you are an experienced hiker  already familiar with the Grand Canyon who wishes to explore the less  familiar, this video may be a bit basic for you.  Then again, you might  just learn some new things from it.",965779200,3,691,4.794871794871795
180209,5,1558381902,"The video hikers have been waiting for has finally arrived.  Computer animations lead you through the corridor trails.  The Bright Angel, North and South Kaibab trails are covered in full.  These rim to river trails can  be extremely dangerous even for an experienced hiker.  As webmaster of  HikeArizona. COM, which focuses on day hiking, I've avoided these longer  trails in the past.  Having viewed the video I feel more prepared and  confident in tackling a trip down to the river.
Important information  about pace and hydration make this video valuable.  Additional general  information about preparing for the worst may save your life.  Profiles of  the canyon's layers have boggled my mind in the past.  You can read all you  want but the visual presentation makes more sense.  All the above plus  trail specific information make this a great video.
Ironically few videos  cover this beautiful canyon.  I'm pleased to highly recommend, ""Hiking the  Grand Canyon"" - the corridor trails.  Let's hope the future holds a second  video highlighting other canyon trails.  - joe",961200000,4,1079,5.104046242774566
180210,5,1558381902,"This Video is a must see for anyone even considering hiking in the Grand  Canyon. This is a detailed and complete guide to the Corridor Trails,  including The Bright Angel Trail, The North Kaibab Trail, and the South  Kaibab Trail. Every aspect of Canyon Hiking is covered.  Computer animation  siquences give detailed information about the Canyon that both hikers and  non hikers will find interesting and useful. Hiking times, weather, and  water consumption are amoung the many topics covered. This video should be  manditory watching for anyone planing a hike into the Grand Canyon.

Unfortunately the quality of the video is in poor condition (read OLD).
Both, DVD and book are very helpfull to organise the hike I was/am planning. For example; I learned that I am much too late to book my stay at the bottom of the canyon! ;-(",1308787200,,362,4.417910447761194
180212,4,1558381902,"Our family hiked the Grand Canyon this past summer and this video was a wonderful reminder of our adventure.  I think this product would be best for someone who was trying to gain factual information about canyon hikes; however, it is not necessarily an entertaining video.  The quality is somewhat like a home video or perhaps a school project production.  While I may sound a little critical, we found watching this video and reliving our hike was one of the highlights of our Chrismtas day.",1293235200,,493,4.776470588235294
180213,3,1558381902,"If you are considering a trip into the canyon then the video is interesting and entertaining, otherwise bland. But if you are considering a trip into the canyon the video is woefully inadequate. You need to do much research on websites and with books. It is nice to see real life pictures, but I doubt I ever play it again.",1251849600,,323,4.4
180214,4,1558381902,"This review compares this dvd (Corridor Trails) with a recently released Grand Canyon trail guide, which is also carried by Amazon.

I got this dvd (Corridor Trails) a few years ago and found it very helpful as an introduction to the Grand Canyon.

Recently, another dvd guide to GC trails has become available ""DVD Hiking Guide - Grand Canyon National Park"". I also have this dvd. Here is a quick sum-up of some of the differences:

Trails Covered: ""Corridor trails"" covers the 3 corridor trails (Bright Angel, North Kaibab and South Kaibab). ""DVD Hiking Guide - Grand Canyon"" covers 14 trails (the 3 corridor trails, and 11 more - one of which is the classic Rim Trail).

Video Footage: Both dvds include video footage taken from the trails. ""DVD Hiking Guide.."" includes more footage of the animal life, streams and plants that can be seen along the trails. It also includes tips on where to see fossils and indian paintings (""Corridor trails"" lacks this information).

Orientation/Maps: Both ""Corridor Trails"" and ""DVD Hiking Guide - GC"" use maps to orient you to the location of the trails..and at times to your location on the trail. ""Corridor Trails"" also has a 3D flyover from rim to rim. This is cool, and is not in ""DVD Hiking Guide..""

Both dvds are getting well-deserved 4 & 5 star reviews.",1197849600,5,1302,4.764444444444444
180215,4,1558381902,"A good high-level overview DVD of three main hiking trails (North and South Kaibab and the Bright Angel Trail).

The actual film of some trail sections, along with the topographical and geological graphics, were reasonably well done and helpful.

Since we are doing the hikes in the winter, it would have helped us if there was more detail regarding the likely conditions and equipment required for the snow and ice that we are expecting.

One the other hand, the DVD did give us a sense of what the trails are like, and we will plan for the worst, and hope for the best!",1169769600,,571,4.524271844660194
180216,4,1558381902,"This is an excellent introduction to the trails of the Grand Canyon.  Not only do they describe the trails, distances, and difficulty level, but also valuable information on how to hike the trails without hurting yourself.  In order to prepare, they provide you with brief guidelines as to your cardio ability, supplies you will need, and what to expect during your hike (including water/rest breaks).  They also give some information as to locations for water and lodging.  We found this information invaluable in planning our trip!",1168300800,,533,5.162790697674419
180217,5,1558381902,I think this is an excellent DVD for a 1st time vistor to the Grand Canyon.  The video gives one a great start for the geology of the canyon and breaks down the 3 major trails and their advantages and disadvantages.

180218,5,1558381902,"If you get a reservation at Phantom Ranch (call WAY in advance) which is the ranch down at the bottom of the canyon with REAL beds, you do not get a video from the park, at least I did not and I just hiked down and back last Memorial Day.  I have seen this video and found it very valuable in planning my first hike in the canyon down the South Kaibab trail and back up the Bright Angel trail which are the main trails from the South Rim and are called the corridor trails.  If you are a regular Canyon hiker you are probably already hiking other trails and already know the stuff presented here.  If you are first-timer like me, this is good to get.",1151798400,,650,4.102362204724409
180219,4,1558381902,"A good, complete introduction to the corridor trails including helpful information about the geology, and practical hiking tips.  More experienced hikers may find it to be a little basic, but what do you want from a video that is, after all, about the heavily travelled main trails.  If you are new to these trails you may well be a first-time or casual Grand Canyon hiker, in which case this introduction will be helpful.  I do wish McNamara would do a sequel with information about the less-traveled trails!",1151712000,,509,4.827586206896552
180220,5,1558381902,"OK first off I've never seen the video but will be purchasing it.  My question to you is why would you waste your time giving something a negative review without viewing it first?  Sounds like you have way to much time on your hands.  Spend a little more time in the canyon and enjoy life instead of looking for the negative in things around you.
