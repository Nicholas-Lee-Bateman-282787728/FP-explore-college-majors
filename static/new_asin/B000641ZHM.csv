This has sucha  good message (as do all the other Big Comfy Couch products).  I'll never tire of this show and neither will my daughter at this rate.",1212624000,,293,4.087719298245614
8038145,5,B000641ZHM,"My youngest grandchild of 14 months was intrigued with an old VHS of ""The Big Comfy Couch"". It is a show that featured a young girl as a clown and her doll. I searched trying to find a dvd for her and ran across 2 at Amazon. The price was great the quality was excelant and the content was both charming and educational. They hit on reading, excercize, hygiene and using your imagination and this is the second time in 10 years Loonette and Molly have become welcome visitors in our home. I recommend it to families of children between 1 and maybe 6 years old.",1141257600,,560,4.2924528301886795
