8558092,2,B005QW986Y,"This is the same film as ""Reach for the Sky"" which came out in 2009 and apparently didn't do too well and there appears to be a reason for it. Hannah Hague stars as Eryn Cates, the savvy daughter who must save the Texas ranch. Ron E. Harris plays the evil banker Samuel Mortimer who is ready to foreclose on the ranch due to late payments...however if Hannah was sweet to him...

The family planned on selling the horses to make payment as the cattle are not yet ready. When the horses are stolen, and Pa is badly beaten,  the brother (Zachary Scott Young) decides to rob the stagecoach, but that too meets with failure. Everything now falls on Hannah.

The acting is pitiful as is the dialouge and script. There is a kung-fu scene where Hannah fights the image of Master Chin (Tze Yep) which must rank among the worst on film. Adam Hagenbuch plays Ranger John Flint who is investigating the robbery and is sweet on Hannah. Jamie Lail provides the token adult entertainment as a prostitute named Chastity.

As a camp MST type movie, 3 stars. As a regular film, it doesn't past the smell test. Hannah Hague was simply awful.

No f-bombs, no nudity, no real sex. Some minor sex talk, innuendos.

And the editing was bad too. (Didn't want to leave anybody out.)",1331337600,7,1258,4.495614035087719
