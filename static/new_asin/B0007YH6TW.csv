8054064,1,B0007YH6TW,"It doesn't just ""contain"" original footage and ""highlights of"" the most important and well-known speeches made by Churchill. That's all there is to this DVD. I was expecting some background documentary stuff on Churchill's rise to power in the War Years, his conduct and leadership and some detail about what events had inspired these particular comments - at least!",1518393600,,366,5.220338983050848

8054068,5,B0007YH6TW,"I am a 'collector' of Winston Churchill memorabilia and this certainly came up to my expectations. I lived through the war years in England and well remember his motivational speeches.  Nothing like them.  I believe WC is the reason we allies won the war, but that is my own private opinion.",1437091200,2,291,4.686274509803922
8054069,5,B0007YH6TW,If you are a fan of churchill this is a must have.  I never get tired of him delivering his awe inspiring speeches even more so knowing that he wrote them all himself. He was known to drink quite a lot.  I would gladly become a wild alcoholic if it would empower me to such glorious words. Listening and watching this cd is like being able to listen to Hemingway or Orwell in person reading excerpts of their finest works.,1416528000,2,422,4.2625

8054071,5,B0007YH6TW,"I was pleased with the documentary of Winston Churchill. I learned a lot about his personality and his politics. I did like the PBS version of his documentary, but I liked the actual speeches and the words of Winston Churchill himself, and not a actor portraying Winston Churchill.",1299801600,4,281,4.875
8054072,5,B0007YH6TW,"Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, KG, OM, CH, TD, FRS, PC, PC (Can) served as First Lord of the Admiralty during ""The Great War."" In the mid-1930s, he railed in Parliament against Germany's build-up of their war capabilities, but his warnings seemed to fall on deaf ears.

Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's attempt at appeasement (the Munich Agreement) failed when Hitler's armies invaded Poland on 9/2/39. War was declared on Germany the next day. Churchill was reappointed First Lord Admiral and within a year, he would be the new Prime Minister. He gave many inspirational speeches during the war years, in Parliament and via radio. After victory in Europe and despite yeoman service to his country, Churchill was turned out of office in the July, 1945 elections.
