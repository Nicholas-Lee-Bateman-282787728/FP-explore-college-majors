7904185,5,B000006FES,"I was brought up on Ramona books and tapes (books on tapes). It was always easy to relate to Ramona - her problems in school, with her family, and her own thoughts and ideas. They started airing the eight episode series when I  was about eight and it was my favorite thing to watch. Even now, watching  any one of the episodes makes me feel like a kid again - even being 21, I  can still relate to her. The screenplays are very well written and the  casting of Ramona, her sister Beezus, and her parents is perfect. Sarah  Polley who played Ramona well is now in her early twenties and stars in the  movie ""GO"" among other ones.",959040000,4,628,4.235294117647059
