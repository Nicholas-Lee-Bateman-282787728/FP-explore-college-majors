1637831,5,B00005NX1M,"This Dream Box Set is truely Sailor Moon at its best. I loved all three movies, although it would not be very hard for a die hard fan like me!!!! The DVD version offers a whole lot of extra stuff, such as songs, images and info on characters but best of all it's got tranformation scenes!!!!! I love Sailor Mars' one so much, hasn't she got the best shoes? The storylines also allow the other scouts to shine a bit more but not too much because of the restrains of the time. If you're gonna spend your money wisely this year, buy this DVD.",1041379200,4,539,4.1923076923076925
1637832,5,B00005NX1M,"For the true blue Sailor Moon fan, this is a delight.  You get all three of the movies in it's full uncut, uncensored form (in both japanese AND uncut english (only available on these DVDs)).  The original japanese scores are kept intact in the english versions, so you don't get that ridiculous (but sometimes nice) DiC produced music.
Some of the extras are nice, but nothing too fancy.
My favorite movie is probably the S movie, mostly because I felt it was the most original (and it centers on LUNA!).  R has a very obvious recall to the R TV series with the main villain, and even SuperS has it's recalling from the TV series with it's connection to ""dreams"".
I highly suggest picking this up for some of the best Sailor Moon action ever created, fully uncut and uncensored.",1018137600,21,779,4.55
1637833,4,B00005NX1M,"Sailor Moon R Movie : This movie was one of the better. Good storyline  featuring Mamoru's childhood friend Fiore. If this film featured SuperSailor Senshi and the Outer Senshi, it would be easily a winner. 8/10
Sailor Moon S Movie : Probably the worst of the films, this one tels the story of a Snow Princess and Luna falling in love. Features no new attacks, but has the outer senshi in it. 7/10 Sailor Moon SuperS Movie : Usually this film is thought of as the worst of the films, but we thought that is was one of the best. New attacks include Space Sword Blaster and Submarine Reflection, and new looks for many of the attacks. 8/10",1018051200,,637,4.398305084745763
1637834,5,B00005NX1M,"I just want to start out by saying that I DO NOT OWN this box set.  I instead bought each of these movies individually at about 25 bucks apiece, plus shipping and handling, which cost me about 28 to 29 dollars each.  This is a great thing to have!
Secondly, these are great movies.  In my opinion, (and I know people will argue with me) I believe the Sailor Moon R was the best, then Sailor Moon SuperS, and finally Sailor Moon S.  Like I said, I know people will probably argue with me, but I don't care.  This is a great set of movies, and none of them are not worth buying!....",1012003200,,580,4.097345132743363
1637835,5,B00005NX1M,"Instead of purchasing each dvd why not just get this boxset version, it's exactly the same.  Plus it comes with a box (thus calling it boxset =^_^=) to keep these sailor moon movies in place.
Each movie are from a specific season.  ""Promise of the Rose"" was from the Sailor Moon R season.  This is one of my favourite movie in the entire world because it shows the past of Mamoru (Darien) during his younger years.  Very sweet =^v^=
Sailor Moon S - ""Hearts in Ice"" was a good movie too!  If you've read the graphic novel by Mixx Sailor Moon 11, the movie is based on this section of the story.  Luna is so pretty as a human. ^_~
Sailor Moon SuperS - ""Black Dream Hole"" involves a new friend that Chibiusa's makes.  This movie really shows the loving relationship between Usagi and Chibiusa even though they may fight a lot they really love each other as a family (along with Mamoru) ;D",1010707200,8,885,4.359756097560975
1637836,5,B00005NX1M,"Sailor Moon is perhaps the best-known entrant in the popular magical girl genre of Japanese animation.  The five-season television series has spawned a vast array of merchandise, as well as musicals and the three films included in this PlayStation2-compatible DVD box set.
The first 2 seasons of Sailor Moon were first shown on North American television in Fall 1995, dubbed (badly) in English.  A few years later, Cartoon Network began showing more of the series, with an even worse English dub than before >:-(  In both cases, the series was also edited for North American TV.  The DVD box set, however, provides the opportunity to both watch and hear the three Sailor Moon films as intended: unedited and in Japanese!!!  I originally owned all three films on subtitled VHS and showed them to a group of friends who had never seen the films (sub or dub), and they were all pleasantly surprised at the differences when unedited and subtitled.
For those who have only seen the North American version of the TV series, a potential point of confusion is that the characters have different names in the original Japanese: Usagi becomes Sailor Moon, Ami becomes Sailor Mercury, Rei becomes Sailor Mars, Mako becomes Sailor Jupiter, Mina becomes Sailor Venus, Hotaru becomes Sailor Saturn, Setsuna becomes Sailor Pluto, Haruka becomes Sailor Uranus, Michiru becomes Sailor Neptune, and Mamoru becomes Tuxedo Mask/Kamen.
Finally, for those completely unfamiliar with the Sailor Moon series, these are standalone films.  In fact, one of my professors showed the Sailor Moon S film in one of her classes, and none of the students wwere familiar with the series or the films.  However, if this is your first Sailor Moon purchase, it likely WILL NOT be your last!!!!!",1008374400,8,1757,5.037931034482758

Do not regret this order, BUY BUY BUY! I preordered this set, by the way, I feel like I spend 65 bucks for a good cause. Notice this, if you buy them seperately I'll cost about 70-75 maybe even 80 bucks! Now, it'll be cheaper just to buy this nifty box set.

Each disk is full of extras including background on Japanese mythology, the characters transformations and attacks and even the edited openings used for the VHS releases!
The movies themselves are beyond compare featuring some of the most memorable scenes (and animation!) of the Sailormoon series such as the Inners trapped on a meteor plummeting to Earth and Luna's transformation into her human form! The DVDs also allow you to watch these feature films in Japanese or English which makes for great comparisons between the two cultures.

I recommend this set for anyone, as it has the English and Japanese versions of the film, and the subtitles are almost spot on.  The end of the Sailor Moon R movie does just cut off instead of doing the credits, but the movies are still perfect.

Just a note for those buying it, if you want subtitles on, or if you choose to watch the English dub, you have to go to the menu.  my DVD went right into auto play of the Japanese with no Subtitles, so just check for that!",1300233600,2,692,4.0962962962962965

Even if it's bootleg it's a good quality. I'm only disappointed in the fact that it cuts off the end of the R movie, like right before the credits roll it cuts straight to the menu.

The closing is cut short, credits are missing and the art work sucks. Buy them this way only if you are not a die hard fan. Or if you're poor. If this is for someone new to Sailor moon or you just want something to show the kids then ya I'm all over that idea! Get it. Everyone that says watch it subtitled to see the real version is right. Words are changed but not as bad as the episodes. You do get an english option if you want. ah lets see the set includes 'hearts on ice, sailor moon s' the three outer planet sailor scouts fight with the regular girls on this one and luna has a love interest (not artemis). An evil ice witch tries to rule the planet and so the fight is on.

Promise of the rose, Sailor moon r involves an old friend of tuxedo mask's who wants to renew their friendship/relationship? Something kinky is going on there! this 'friend' goes crazy and wants to take out the sailor scouts and have tuxedo mask all to himself. Gives you knew insight on the whole rose thing though. And the battle begins!

Black dream hole, Sailer moon super s is mostly about mini moon and is a good one for the kiddies. Once again an evil entity wants to control earth and the scouts must defend the earth and it's children.",1175040000,5,1352,4.117424242424242

1637858,5,B00005NX1M,"This case has a collection of three Sailor Moon movies hears my opinions and ratings of what I thought of each one of them.

[Sailor Moon R: (Promise of the Rose)] 10/10 - This is the best EVER Sailor Moon material I have ever seen and I have watched everything there is to watch about Sailor Moon and I think this takes the cake and in case your wondering, I am talking about the japanese version because I haven't seen the english version but I am told alot of awesome great scenes were cut out.

[Sailor Moon S: (Hearts in Ice)] 8/10 - This is good, solid dose of typical Sailor Moon fun, with the appearance by the Outer Senshi, the smooth animation, and the sweet plotline revolving around Luna's love for an astronomer making this especially good. Kudos to the very slick music and the directing as well. Senshi die-hards need not hesitate, and for others, this is a very good way to sample some of the brilliant Sailor Moon series. My only regret is the manga version is streets ahead of this.

[Sailor Moon S: movie 3 (Black Dream Hole)] 9/10 - This is a decent film, my fav. before I saw movie R. The story is straight forward, but the action dominate the movie. That's not bad to me, but for others who want a good story line, see movie R or S. Anyway, I was hopping Sailor saturn was going to be in it, but sadly, she wasn't. Oh well. By the way the planets Uranus and Neptune in this drop hints on... you know... at a point. Devoted fans will know what I'm talking about. Overall, this is the best action movie.

Suggested to people 13 up for violence and brief nudity.",1126915200,,1581,4.313131313131313
1637859,5,B00005NX1M,"This is the best thing ever!! I'm so glad I bought it, even if I bought it elsewhere. My box set was the signature series one. But anyway...you get the original Japanese version it all it's glory, but you also get...the uncut English version!!!! Well, you still have to deal with the crappy English dialouge but all the edited scenes are put back in, including untouched transformations (Luna included)!!! If you are a REAL Sailor Moon fan, you'll stop complaining and get this boxset now!!!!!",1116547200,6,493,4.811764705882353
1637860,5,B00005NX1M,"VERY good box set of the 3 full length R, S and SuperS films! These films, though they're part of the series have a seperate unique story all their own. They're very well made and the subtitling on them is really good too, I think. On these DVDs, you can hear the original Japanese language track, or the dub track for those who like to compare. I personally favor the Japanese track since I really like Hisakawa Aya, Fukami Rika and Mitsiushi Kotono and I like ZERO of the dub actors hehe. ^^; And Moon Revenge beats The Power of Love to a pulp. There are even extras sections that have image galleries and character profiles which is really cool. :) So, I recommend this set.

Here are the titles of the movies.
SailorMoonR The Promise of the rose. My favorite Movie
SailorMoonS Hearts In Ice. Kinda of slow but good.
Sailor Moon SuperS Black Dream Hole very good.
I got this when it first came out. I have all the episodes on DVD and VHS including sailor stars. I even have season1 and 2 boxsets that are in eng sub not dub.",1064620800,2,454,4.170454545454546
1637864,5,B00005NX1M,"These three movies are the pinacles of each Sailor Moon season and they show how each of the characters need ""the Power of Love""(the closing song of the Sailor Moon R:Promise of the Rose movie)and that together they are stronger and will be undefetable as long as they stand united. Those that are new to the whole Sailor Moon world might need some background on the whole lot of the Sailor gang. Sailor Moon or Usagi is a lovable cry-baby of a character(as Rei will often remind her)and is also more than she apears, as she is also the Moon Princess Serenity who on many ocassions has saved the world with the courage of the strong and beautiful princess she was and will be. She is acompanied by the four sailor scouts(Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus)who are her closest friends and who are always there to support her no matter what the situation. Sailor Mercury or Ami is a genious and a friend to the end. Sailor Mars or Rei can some times compete with Usagi for the main attention of all around her, but when she's in the heat of battle she is not one for playing nice or to be stopped easily. Sailor Jupiter or Leta(or Makoto as she is called in Japanesse), is not at all going to let anyone get in her way of protecting her friends and is there when you need a shoulder to cry on. Last but by no means lest is Sailor Venus or Mina(Minako in Japanesse)who is the super star of the group formally known as Sailor V in England. She is shy but not when it comes to helping out her fellow scouts and lending a hand to save the world. Then we come to the mysterious ""outer plant"" scouts: Sailors, Uranus, Pluto, and Neptune. These scouts don't come into the picture until the second movie (Sailor Moon S: Hearts in Ice) and show up in the last movie as well(Sailor Moon Super S: Black Dream Hole) They seem stronger than the others and they come to the rescue a few times. These scouts also seem to feel superior to the other(probably younger)scouts. They are good people as well as good scouts. Sailor Uranus or Haruka is a tom-boy and the others acctually don't know she is a girl until she tells them, and she is a valient fighter with her sword. Sailor Neptune or Michiru is a sweet and carefree person and is usually the voice of reason in some situations and also uses her mirror to help those in need. Sailor Pluto or Setsuna is the oldest of the three and she is also the Keeper of the Keys of Time and a strong fighter. She uses the Garent Orb to fight the forces of darkness. The the last two ( but probably the most important to Usagi- no disrespect to the others) are Darien(Mamoru) and Rini(Chibi Usa or Sailor Chibi Moon). Darien is Usagi's true love and is also the Prince of the Earth and always there for Sailor Moon. His feelings really show in the ""Promise of the Rose"" when his friend Fiore comes back to Earth after his long journey and sees how much the two love each other and would go any lenghth for their love. Chibi Usa is the mysterious girl from the future who comes to help the scouts and find out things from the past. All of these people and some many more all help and love each other and are all there for the one perpose of stopping evil in it's tracks before it destroys Earth. In "" Promise of the Rose"" Darien's old friend Fiore is back and becomes jelous of Usagi and Darien's love and tries to end it. In ""Hearts on Ice"" a terrible Witch named Princess Kaguya wants to use a special crystal to freeze the Earth(man there are alot of baddies out for the Earth huh!?)and it is a must see for those of you who like alittle unexpected romance. It's even more interesting because it is between Luna and a scientist named Kekiru(yes a cat and a human- things get interesting with some wishes that help Luna to turn into a human- and I have to agree with other Sailor Moon fans that wrote reviews; she is very pretty in human form =^_~=)In the third and last movie in this box set, the evil witch,Badiyanu starts to collect Pink Sugar Heart Energy from all of the childeren on Earth and she takes a special interest in Chibi Usa and takes her along with all the other childeren. This shows how much and how far Usagi will go to save the person(people)she loves. As a whole these movies are a great way to show off the acheivments of the scouts and show that it was no easy task of obtaining them and making everything and anything possible. And they also do great justice to the Sailor Moon Universe. I enjoy them so much that I sugest them to anyone who enjoys not only Sailor Moon, but also anime in general!(Sorry about the lenghth, but the information is a must have and I'm only looking out for the justification of Sailor Moon and the satisfaction of the viewers!)",1060300800,2,4706,4.336734693877551
