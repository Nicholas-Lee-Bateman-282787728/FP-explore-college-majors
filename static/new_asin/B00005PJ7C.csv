7949358,2,B00005PJ7C,"It took quite a long time to receive this by parcel post.  When it finally did come in we had forgotten we even ordered the thing.
They only reason I bought it was that I, and my drama club, were extras while it was filmed at my high school (North Marion High).  It was so peiced together that Jamie Pressley wasn't even in the movie orginally.",1238976000,,344,4.196969696969697
7949359,5,B00005PJ7C,"This is a fantastic movie. The story is well written and the cast is amazing!
The movie is about a group of childhood friends and the lives they live ""on the other side of the track"". It's an emotional roller-coaster ride that explodes upon social class differences, emotional abandonment, the bonds of ever-lasting friendship and the sacrifices one will make for another in the hope for them to live a better life.

It's a must see!",1015977600,3,433,4.697368421052632
