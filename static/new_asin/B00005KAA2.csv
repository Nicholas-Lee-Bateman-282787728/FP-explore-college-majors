7942948,5,B00005KAA2,"This film follows up on the children we saw last when their mentor Jacques D'Amboise received his Kennedy Center Honors recognition several years earlier.

At the end of his career as a ballet dancer, Jacques D'Amboise, at loose ends, reinvented himself by creating a dance program in elementary schools, more athletic than balletic. The documentary ""He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'"" followed that adventure which culminated in an annual dance program at Madison Square Garden involving hundreds of the participating children. The sock-o finish was a delicious comedic Godfather parody dance to original music, featuring the best of the children and a few adult dancers including volunteers from the New York City Police force. Kevin Kline & Judy Collins narrated this imaginative unforgettable production.

Those same children went on to successful careers in business, law, finance, buoyed by the wider world view, the confidence and discipline they experienced in their dancing. Gradually those successful young adults found themselves turning to the arts, where this documentary follows their creating careers around artistic expression, often reaching out to and teaching children as they, themselves, were taught.

It's time for the DVD release of the original documentary. We need ""He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'"" and we need it often.",1373068800,,1339,5.458937198067633

To see young children working hard to master dance with the inspiration of Jacques d'Ambois to guide them is wonderful. To see how many of these children have prospered is remarkable. Every person I know who has seen this film has been inspired to fight to maintain arts programs in their schools, even when school budgets are in short supply.",1079913600,4,428,4.571428571428571
7942951,5,B00005KAA2,"Jacques D'Amboise demonstrates the difference between a teacher and a mentor. A teacher gives information, a mentor literally reaches into a child's life and lifts him/her to a higher plane. In this video, it's great to watch Jacques coach average kids into above-average performance, and provoke them into seeing greatness in themselves, and his technique has obvious application in all fields, not just artistic or physical. This video is superb for not only profiling an accomplished mentor like Jacques, but for showing us the incredible power of dance to unchain a child's imagination, and boost their self esteem.",993859200,10,619,5.326530612244898
