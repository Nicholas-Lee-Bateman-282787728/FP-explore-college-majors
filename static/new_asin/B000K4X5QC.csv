8154240,5,B000K4X5QC,"One hour of Golson with Art Farmer, Curtis Fuller, Jon Hendricks, etc. at  the 1996 Berlin Jazz Festival, plus another version of ""Whisper Not"" from the Skopje Festival that same year, as well as three audio-only tracks from three different Golson CDs.  The surprise for some may be the exceptional playing of the then very young and just emerging pianist Geoff Keezer, as attested to by the admiring glances of his elders during his solos.  You can't go wrong with this DVD.",1384732800,,475,4.7682926829268295
8154241,5,B000K4X5QC,"This DVD is what a good concert should be, It is of great
quality, both visual and audio. If you are familiar with
jazz, you know these guys are top shelf musicians that
created a sound in the 50s and 60s, that still sounds
modern. This one, you will treasure.",1214006400,2,260,4.22
8154242,5,B000K4X5QC,"There is a special empathy around Mr. Golson. I think it begins with his lyrical compositions more than with his master command in his sax playing and more than with simpathetic look. Happens that Mr. Golson is also a unique player. Also happens that he looks so gentle a man.

Golson counts on his long time trumpet player associate, another master, Mr. Art Farmer. Seems like they were born together. Rhythm section is also brilliant, featuring Geoff Keezer at the piano, as brilliant as young.

Repertoire includes the title song 'Whisper Not', one of the great jazz standards composed by Golson.

Also Jon Hendricks shows his artistry in some Golson material as great as ever.

Features an uncommon image and color quality. Recorded in Europe.",1179878400,5,747,4.952
