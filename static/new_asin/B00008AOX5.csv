1834227,1,B00008AOX5,"""El Crimen del Padre Amaro"" is apparently the highest grossing film in Mexican history, no doubt helped by the presence of Gael Garcia Bernal.  I have greatly enjoyed several recent films from Mexico, including ""Amores Perros"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien,"" both of which starred Bernal.  This film is clearly trying to ride the wave of success of these films, but I found it to fall far short.
The movie is based loosely on a book from the 1870s, but it is set in the present and tries to tackle the age-old tensions between passion, religion, and faith.  Bernal plays a young priest who is assigned to a church in a small town.  He immediately is embroiled in a number of political issues (mostly unclear and melodramatic) surrounding the church.  At this point, his character is a saintly blank slate.  As tensions increase in the church, he turns to a young, pious female church member.
This relationship causes him to commit a serious of rather un-priestly behaviors.  This scenario is potentially interesting, but the film is not deep enough to explore these issues.  By the end of the film, he has changed completely to a rather unlikeable person who seems to think only of himself.  The changes in his character are never explained and do not seem real.  Bernal is also simply too likeable of an actor to pull off this role successfully.  His matinee idol looks and the way that the camera often lingers on him in close-up do not help.
Many people are likely to find this film controversial because of the issues of religion and sin that it addresses - I disliked it because it's a boring, melodramatic film.  A real disappointment.",1053820800,9,1634,4.6947368421052635
1834228,4,B00008AOX5,"The 2002 Mexican film is based on a 1875 Portuguese novel even though it's set in modern Mexico. It's about  the power of the church with its political intrigues and a hospital being funded by drug money. But most of all, It's about a young priest, his humanity and his sins.
The director did a good job of bringing the beauty of Mexico with all its contradictions to the screen.  And Gael Garcia Bernal, cast as the young priest is a good actor.  The entire case is excellent, the feeling of the film completely authentic and the social issues are loud and clear.  The film had the power to bring me right into the heart of the time and place as it sets forth the moral conflicts and forbidden love.  It's a story that has created a lot of attention because of its shocking theme, which is definitely offensive to the church.
However, in spite of the skill of the filmmakers and the depth of the concept, I found myself bored.  In fact I kept dozing off and then replaying the parts I had missed.  It moves at a snail's pace and there are really no surprises throughout even though I applaud it for giving me a glimpse a very real church-dominated Mexico",1053129600,3,1155,4.394366197183099
1834229,3,B00008AOX5,"so what was the big deal about this movie? yes the acting is fine and the story is ok, but shocking and contraversial? yes somewhat but nothing that amazing. Compared to the movie Priest which was out a few years before, this is alot tamer. Watch out for the Magdalene Sisters which is coming to theathers this year for more contraversy.",1051574400,3,337,4.540983606557377
1834230,4,B00008AOX5,"Shows how love, lust and religious taboo mingle. Great with a lot of guts to this contraversial movie. The critics who say this is a telenovela is wrong. This has nothing to do with a telenovela, especially a Mexican telenovela.",1051401600,,228,4.725
1834231,5,B00008AOX5,"EL CRIMEN DEL PADRE AMARO packs a wallop on many levels.  Based on an 1875 novel, this story of the gradual downfall of an idealistic young priest sent out into the reality of the clerical world in the small villages in Mexico updated to contemporary times is unrelentingly fascinating, visually stunning, uncompromisingly frank in its stance on Catholic decadence, and directed and acted with finesse.  Gael Garcia Bernal continues to mature as an actor and as a screen presence, making his Padre Amaro metamorphose from committed innocent to fallen sparrow in a wholly credible fashion.  Despite our sadness with his bad decisions and choices, Bernal is able to keep us with this complex young priest and in doing so we are able to clearly examine the fragmented state of affairs in the hands of various priests tainted with lust, pride, sloth and a bit of each of the seven deadly sins.  Director Daniel Carrera knows how to create both spectacular and intimate scenes and he masterfully leads his gifted cast through a more than difficult story.
If there is a tendency to berate this film for its anticlerical stance, then the point of the story is missed.  Each of the myriad characters, sacred and profane alike, has a soul of good and one of vulnerability, and given the current tenuous state of the Catholic Church under seige, I think this film helps explain how even men of the cloth can be human.  Kudos for Gael Garcia Bernal, Ana Claudia Talancion, Damian Alcazar and all of the fine cast and crew that created this very impressive and disturbing piece of art.",1051056000,30,1573,4.807407407407408

1834244,3,B00008AOX5,"I will be brief: actors were all great, the female character was simply sweet in her roll. The tragedy was touching. There was a nice touch of magic realism.
Eternal taboo SEX was in full force throughout, so was human desire to escape loneliness. The conflict between the necessity to maintain status quo, and the desire to break it, defining the border between heaven and hell, the mandatory suffering of being human---all elements were present. But the story was too simple for my taste. I did not see any end points that give one a significant WOW.
I still recommend it if you are curious. If you don't watch it, I doubt you will miss too much.",1339027200,,648,4.547008547008547
1834245,3,B00008AOX5,"Bernal is the weakest link here (as, obviously, the best asset this film has). A young catholic priest who starts off in idealistic glory and succumbs to the pressures of cotidian life: fine, but where was the soul searching, the agony and despair in informing his decision to embrace corruption and carnal pleasures? It can't be that hard to do, because Father Natalio ( a phenominally acted character) was able to do it with just a few chosen words and facial expressions: create a whole world, that is, and draw the audience into it. Yes, we all know the pressures on catholic priests in rural sub countries: but character development is always paramount, and it wasn't clear really how Bernal was evolving or why. Apart from that, the best Mexican cinema I have seen in a long time. Secondary characters were well drawn out and the scenery: sublime, with several tableaux vivant moments when Mexico really came out.",1321315200,3,919,4.822784810126582
1834246,5,B00008AOX5,"Great eye opener for unbelievers within the Catholic church.  This movie tells it like it is.  It happened many years and it still exists in today's world. No wonder Mexico tried so hard to boycott this production.  It's a must have as a testimony tool.

I watched this movie in theaters back in 02 or 03.. and it is still by far one of the best movies (not just foreign movies) I have ever seen. It has love, betrayel, corruption, religion, and many other subjects that just make this movie complete. I won't get into details.. you can read the plot summary yourself.

Buy it, rent it, netflix it, whatever. Everyone should watch this movie. It really is an incredible experience from beginning to end.",1292198400,,534,4.610526315789474
1834248,5,B00008AOX5,"Quick synopsis: When young Father Amaro arrives into town, tragedy quickly unfolds herself in a long, twisted series of seemingly minute events. As he forges friendships within his new diocese, Amaro makes decisions which will bring his character into crisis.

From the moment we are introduced to Father Amaro, we quickly see that he is not a fighter. On the way into town, the bus is robbed by local banditos. The man sitting next to Father Amaro is looted from his life savings. Quiet, perhaps cautious, Father Amaro doesn't seem moved one way or another, although he gives the man some pocket change. In town, Amaro is quickly introduced to a cast of characters, which include the senor priest, the town's ""old cat lady"" the priests' housekeeper and her beautiful, pious daughter, Amelia, whose boyfriend, Reuben, works as the local journalist. It is quickly evident that all is not as it seems. Father Bendito, with hopes of raising a bone fide hospital, has engaged in questionable money transactions with the mayor and  local cartels. Meanwhile rumors of their fellow father, Father Netal, being involved with the mountainside guerrillas cirrculate and draw attention from the Bishop.

As Father Amaro befriends his new parish, he becomes involved with the hospital, specifically with the efforts of suppressing the unwanted attention from Ruben's story which has uncovered, in no uncertain terms, the unsavory ""blood money"" donations between the local cartel and Father Bendito. Eager to please the Bishop and secure his career, Amaro expediently solves the problem. He also acts on the Bishops behalf in an attempt to corral the wandering shepherd, Father Netal, who seems to have become less obedient and increasingly vigilante. Meanwhile, his personal life takes a turn as he notices his beautiful parishioner, Amelia, whose role in the church increasingly mirrors that of her mother's.

Carrera's slow build towards the plot's inevitable zenith is as quiet and creeping as the growth of the characters. Each personality is as guileless as the person it reflects, each character is ruled by their sincerity. The tainted Father Bendito is as genuine as the innocent yet sensual Amelia. The Bishop is as straightforward and sincere in his demands as the town ""witch"" is with her underhanded offers. The only character who is truly corrupt is the handsome, pure-looking Father Amaro, who consciously prioritizes himself and his well-being over those most entrusted to his care. In contrast to the film's understated Father Netal, whose backwater simplicity belies Amaro's quick accent into favor, Netal's commitment to his mountainside parishoners echos faintly of the ministerial Jesus. Besides Netal, Father Amaro is painted for his worth- a white washed tomb.

Considering the deeply religious tamber of the film, I took personal relish in the fact that the only scripture verses recited throughout were the Songs of Solomon, quoted by Father Amaro during his inflamed acts of carnality. All the other spiritual maxims were the formal recitations of the catechism, psalter prayers or church canticles. When a young child asks the Sunday School teachers what fornication means in his catechism, we receive a more genuine answer upon the heady, praying lips of Amaro as he quotes the Songs in a heat of passion. The fact that the only person who reported the truth was the agnostic son of the town's lone atheist  also sets a biting tone. In the end, Father Amaro takes over the ailing Bendito's position and looks over a congregation which can no longer hide behind a veil of innocence. He is trapped within his own web- the church itself.",1282003200,5,3649,5.134680134680135
1834249,5,B00008AOX5,AWESOME!  IT is so goood.... I watched that movie repeatedly.  I know it is wrong completely but their actions are so good especially beautiful actor/actress.,1224460800,,158,5.28
1834250,2,B00008AOX5,"After being pleased with ""Motorcycle Diaries"", I thought I would check out more  of Gael Garcia Bernal's work.  This movie was a huge disappointment. It was so amateurish that the darker aspects seemed silly, and the ending that could have been poignantly tragic, seemed sordid and pointless.  As a practing Catholic myself, I was curious to see what the Mexican Church found so scandalous about this movie.  At the end of the movie, I was left thinking that philosophical differences with the Church should be explored, but sophmoric mudslinging might just deserve repression.",1190332800,2,577,5.172043010752688
1834251,4,B00008AOX5,"I saw the movie and although I realize things happens like this, I still could not accept it. Good movie, recommend to see.",1185062400,,123,4.391304347826087
1834252,5,B00008AOX5,"Father Amaro (Gael Garcia Bernal) is a young priest sent to work in the small, rural town of Los Reyes, Mexico. Father Amaro is idealistic at first. But soon discovers that his senior priest, Father Benito, has an ongoing affair with a local woman named Sanjuanera and that he is also laundering drug money for some murderous narco-traffickers in order to raise funds to build a ""First World quality"" hospital.

Soon Father Amaro finds himself involved in his own forbidden love affair with a romantically obsessed young girl named Amelia (Ana Claudia Talacon). When Amelia becomes pregnant the selfish Father Amaro seeks to protect his own career by pressuring Amelia into having an abortion. But the illegal abortion is botched and Amelia ends up bleeding to death. Yet, despite all his horrific misdeeds, Father Amaro is wrongly credited as being a hero for trying to save Amelia while the blame for her pregnancy and abortion is falsely placed on her ""heretic"" ex-boyfriend.

This movie depicts a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, with the worst characters, most notably Father Amaro himself, making out fine. While those with good intentions tend to suffer. For instance, the idealistic Father Natalio is ex-communicated by the Church for his devotion to a village of poor peasants. So, yes, this movie does offer a critique on the corruption within the Catholic Church. But, more importantly, it is about the corruption of the soul, which each of us, as human beings, are susceptible to.

""The Crimes Of Father Amaro"" was one of the first in what has turned out to be a long line of intelligent, artistic Mexican films made over the last 5 years. I also highly recommend ""Amores Perros"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"". This is a great movie. Go watch it!",1173312000,2,1757,4.929054054054054
1834253,4,B00008AOX5,this is an important movie about the nature of temptation and the complications of living a double life.. It is also an interesting look into hypocracy.. All of the characters are involved in some dirty business.. and this leads to a tragic outcome that will leave us lost in thought at the end.. Very captivating..,1172448000,,315,4.745454545454545
1834254,4,B00008AOX5,"For many priests, celibacy is a true vocation which liberates them... For others, it is a lifelong struggle... If celibacy was made voluntary, not only would many priests be happier, but the Church would be richer... Above all, it might decide the only way to restore the numbers of the priesthood, and that seems to me not a bad idea...

As I understand, a Catholic priest must clearly know that he belongs body and soul, with all that he is, to the church, to her task, to her mission, her work, and her destiny... He must be a public icon of strength, virility, honesty, and dedicated service...

But in 'The Crime of Father Amaro,' the top film in Mexican box-office history, Carlos Carrera shows that even a man with morals and scruples betrays the nature of his profession, mostly when he brazenly criticizes the priesthood, and questions the Catholic Church's representatives on a variety of charges like illicit love affair, corruption, drug dealing, and hypocrisy...

The story takes a liberal priest Father Amaro(Gael Garcia Bernal), protg of a repulsive obese bishop (Ernesto Gomez Cruz), to the remote dusty village of Los Reyes to assist the older priest of the parish Father Benito (Sancho Gracia) in his daily work...

Amaro quickly realizes that virtually every fellow priest is involved in something immoral, and that his aging superior is receiving financial help from the region's drug lord for the construction of a new church-run hospital, and is secretly spending his cold nights with the proprietress of a local restaurant Augustina (Anjelica Aragn). He also discovers that Father Natalio (Damian Alcazar) is suspected of aiding the revolutionary factions in opposing the drug lords and mobsters...

Amaro's own weaknesses is put to the test when he finds himself led into temptation by Augustina 's extremely sensual teenager Amelia (Ana Claudia Talancn) a relationship that eventually goes way outside the bounds of his priestly oath... and, without any sign of inner turmoil, he embarks on a passionate affair with the devout catechism teacher...

Amalia - for whom loving a young priest serves as an extension of her deep piety - decides that the good-looking priest is the one for her and rejects her disappointed boyfriend, the aggressive reporter Ruben (Andres Montiel) who wrote an article alleging that the hospital is a front for laundering drug money...

The most over-the-top performance is provided by Luisa Huertas as the town frightening parishioner Dionisia who takes great delight in exposing heretics... This malicious lady (who, apparently, knows absolutely everything there is to know about anyone...) pretends to put coins in the collection plate but cleverly palms paper money back...

Gastn Melo plays the tender lay-assistant to the elder priest, who cares for his invalid-epileptic daughter, and carries many secrets but tells none..

""The Crime of Father Amaro"" is polemical today as Martin Scorcese's 'The Last Temptation of Christ.'

The film focuses on blasphemous scenes as on a vicious priest who stops at nothing, even by continuing the lies and hypocrisy to protect his career... His value system is completely corrupted... Father Amaro's ability to stand behind his beliefs extents to nothing... His generosity and wealth of spirit becomes selfishness and bitterness... His ambitions to rise in the church hierarchy clouds his judgment...

Mexico is in the middle of a film renaissance which is wonderful if they come up with a new wave of irreverent movies thundering forward juicier targets than the church's vices... sex, abortion, abuse, witchcraft, betrayal, and political corruption...",1166832000,4,3648,5.240137221269297
1834255,5,B00008AOX5,"The release of the film THE CRIME OF PADRE AMARO caused about as much of an uproar in Mexico in 2002 as the publication of the novel, written by Jose Maria Eca de Queiroz, caused in 1875.  With its dangerously intertwining themes of spiritual ecstasy and sexual passion, it's not hard to see why. At the heart of the story is a young priest who wrestles in a major way with the tempting hungers of his body and the grace-filled yearnings of his spirit. It does not help that, to pursue his vocation, he is sent to a town sustained by a culture of corruption.

One thing the actor Gael Garcia Bernal does not know how to do is give a bad performance, and in the movie's title role he captures brilliantly all the agonizing ambiguity that comes with being a young adult male intent on asserting his masculinity while also serving the spiritual needs of his community. Unfortunately, his happily deluded demeanor meets with an equally intense personality in the form of Amelia, a devout young devotee acted with mesmerizing perfection by the gorgeous Ana Claudia Talancon. Amelia idolizes the young priest as a true and noble holy man whose sexuality is made sacred by his presumably pure soul. He in turn dares to drape her in a cape reserved for representations of the Madonna and recites to her from Solomon's ""Song of Songs"" as they seduce each other. Controversial? Better believe it.

As in the film THE HEALER (please see companion review) ""The Crime of Padre Amaro"" depicts sexuality and spirituality as equally powerful forces of attraction capable of producing very different results. The outcome in ""The Crime of Padre Amaro"" is shocking in more ways than one and well worth contemplating for a long time.

1834258,5,B00008AOX5,Gael Garcia Bernal gives another excellent performance in the movie production of a classic story.  Worth the time to view and enjoy.  It is a rather heavy handed indictment of the church -- for a word of warning.,1125532800,,213,4.578947368421052
1834259,3,B00008AOX5,"I felt the characters were underdeveloped.  You would think that a priest would be a little more anguished about betraying his holy vows.  I would have liked to see a little more process and maybe some distress.  It would have been different if he was someone who was struggling with the idea of staying in the priesthood, but he talks about devotion to the religion the whole time.  I also wonder if it was such a big hit in Mexico due to the shock value of seeing a priest commit adultery in such a devoutly religious, primarily catholic country.  I really thought the move had potential and the actors were good. There were some beautiful scenes and not just the ones showing the very attractive priest. I just wish it was a little more psychologically complex.",1118880000,3,764,4.588235294117647
1834260,5,B00008AOX5,"Any movie that discusses the problems going on with the Catholic church is and always will be a subject of controversy. ""The Crime of Padre Amaro"" is not the exception to the rule. However, I looked at it from an actor's point of view rather than from a religious point. This is (I feel) a very well made movie, the acting is excellent from the entire cast as well as the writing of the script and director Carlos Carrera who I believe did an outstanding job directing this rather controversial film.

I saw the movie because like a lot of people I'm a big Gael Garcia Bernal fan. I have (so far) liked every movie that he has be in. He is truly a fine and gifted actor one of the best from today's generation of young actors. I really enjoyed this movie and even a man of the cloth is allowed to make mistakes (even though they take their vows that they will never break any of the Catholic Church cardinal rules especially never to engage in sexual intercourse with a woman. But after all a priest is no different than any other man simply because he swore off temptation. That is why many of them after years of sacrifice cannot go on hiding their feelings and emotions and leave the priesthood for a chance at a normal life with a woman and a family. Overall this movie is excellent and Gael Garcia Bernal proved one more time what a great actor he is. I encourage everyone to see this film it is really fantastic. Even if you don't speak Spanish (it does come with subtitles) the story is very easy to follow and the language becomes second nature once the film gets going. THE CRIME OF PADRE AMARO, was nominated for an Academy award as Best Foreign film and is a shame that it did not win because I feel that it really deserved it.",1113868800,9,1738,4.314984709480123
1834261,4,B00008AOX5,"Let me start off by saying I am a huge Gael Garca Bernal fan. This was the movie to take the cake for me with his acting. His portrayal as a lust-striken youthful priest was so convincing it took my breath away. I was thoroughly impressed with being able to see in his eyes the desire and gradual compromises he disolved to. The movie did dish out some pretty hard-hitting statements about corruption within the Catholic church, but what of it? There lacked a certain something in the film's commentary, somewhat one-sided, I'll admit, but I felt this was justified given the story focuses over one man's plight, between his (apparently shakey) convictions and his new-found desires. The title says it all--it's about the sins of one man, Padre Amaro. It is not a thorough expos of all the Catholic church, in which case there would be truths regarding the bad and the good. Now the reason I gave the movie 4 instead of 5 stars, was simple. The ending was anticlimatic in that it seemed to take the easy way out of a big problem created by our protagonist. The film did too good a job building up the problem making you eagerly anticipate the resolution. The way Padre Amaro takes his final step into ""the other side"" as a priest, was too easy and quick. I wondered how a character who started off so devout to God's service could not see through his own transparent attempt to explain away his final actions. When people sell out, it tends to be more gradual. Well then again I suppose that's the limitation of films over books. I would recommend this to those who are not overly-defensive of the Catholic church, who can simply enjoy it as a tale of one man's flaws. After all, no one's perfect and that's called humanity.",1111276800,25,1724,4.546623794212219
1834262,3,B00008AOX5,"This movie does in fact make a hit at the Cathoic church.

However, you have to remember that this is a movie.

Movies are made for entertainment purposes.

This movie left me with quite a bit of anger, not because of the fact that I'm catholic, but because he was basically a character that has no idea what he's done. He cant seem to graps that fact that the's done something wrong, the fact that he has taken something away from others.

I was furious to be quite frank with the character...so i would have to say that it is a good movie, for those that speak spanish it will make more sense.",1108425600,3,595,4.238938053097345
1834263,3,B00008AOX5,"I love Bernal in almost everything he does, but I felt that this vehicle lacks one crucial element: credibility.  I never quite believed Bernal as a priest, nor did I believe Amelia to be a pious virgin.  As others have observed, no one's hands are clean.  Point made, point taken.  However, the film devolves into melodrama and is resolved far too easily.

Certainly the film is more complex and provocative than the trailer would have you believe.  The production is good, as is the cast.  But the film never quite rises to the level of being a great film, settling instead for a focus on taboo-breaking rather than genuine introspection and repentance.  Does Padre Amaro learn anything except everyone is corrupt?  We'll never know.",1108425600,,735,4.862903225806452
1834264,5,B00008AOX5,"I love Spanish-language movies and so when I saw this one in the 'Best Foreign Language Film category', I had to see it.  It's the story of a handsome young priest who comes to a rural town in Mexico to begin his work.  There he meets the beautiful Amelia and is soon drawn into a sexual relationship with her.  Their actions eventually lead to tragedy.

I thought that Y Tu Mama Tambien was the best Spanish film ever until I saw Amores Perros.  Now that I have seen 'El Crimen del Padre Amaro', I will have to change that assertion as well.  This movie has a more organised plot than the two aforementioned films and is just better all the way around.  Gael Garcia Bernal is at his peak as Padre Amaro.  He pulls off a rather difficult role with ease and passion.

I highly recommend this movie to everyone.(unless you're a staunch Catholic.)",1105401600,3,844,4.428571428571429
1834265,1,B00008AOX5,"I rented this film after seeing that it was nominated for an oscar for best foreign film, and because it stared Gael Garcia Bernal, who was excelent in both Amorres Perros and Y tu mamma tambien.  But what a let-down!  This movie is confused, disorganized, and sometimes just silly.  It's a bad movie, plain and simple.  Especially the way way it starts out with political intrigue and corruption within the catholic church, then suddenly becomes a dramitic love story!  I found the villainous religious old bag character particularly cartoonish and out of place.  But the most surprising is all the beaming reviews!  But then, when people write ""it will make you think"", or finish their loving review by recommending ""swimfan"" and ""lawn-mower man"" you know there's something up....",1091404800,10,782,5.0625
1834266,3,B00008AOX5,"Why do reviewers lament that this was an anti-Catholic film? That's a bit like saying that The Titanic was anti-marine.
Sure, there's plenty of blame to go around, the film is rather brave in its condemnation of social and religious hypocrisy and its expose of political corruption.  It tosses up a laundry list of items that may be embarrassing to the church (which inevitably also happen in real-life) but aside from the shock value, the filmmaker seems to have little to say about the vital dogma issues he raises such as celibacy for the priests.
Why is the word ""crime"" singular when the title character, our newly minted Father Amaro, assists in money laundering in indirect cahoots with the local drug lord, makes the local newspaper publish lies, finances an abortion, and gets his rocks off with an underage nymph under the guise of preparing her for a nunnery? Perhaps because all of these misgivings hark back to one failing: the lack of a conscience fitting to a man in his calling.
Looking at it as a contextual romance gone awry instead of as a religious statement, both the protagonists sport innocence and carnality. Their acting is convincing. The female character is quite attractive, for what it's worth, and one can see why a young priest would have zipper troubles in her company.
In the end though, while the movie did manage to hold my attention I felt that its sense of right and wrong was stultifyingly out of depth and despite all its hardhitting cameos, ultimately a bit unimaginative. Perhaps an attractive rental but I can't grasp why this was a record-breaking megahit in Mexico.",1089504000,11,1609,4.829710144927536
1834267,4,B00008AOX5,"Overall the experience of watching this movie was quite good.  The acting is superb- with all the characters quite believable, cinematography excellent; all in all a beautiful work.  The story itself is also compelling.
The problem that I have with the film is less a cinematic problem than a literary problem.  A ""pet peeve"" of mine is when a producer or director feels that he/she can ""improve"" upon a story that is already an acknowledged masterwork, and makes major changes that are needless.  On occasion this is necessary due to the directors desire to focus on a certain aspect of a work, or present a work cinematically that would not normally be ""doable"" if one stuck closely to the original text (the recent release of ""Troy is a good example).  I understand that this is often necessary, but at least the director ought to have the good graces to present the work under a different name; thus peterson calls his movie ""Troy"" and not ""the Iliad.""
I think Bernal made an error by moving the story from rural 19th century Portugal to modern Mexico.  The thing that makes this story (and indeed the adapted movie) so compelling is that it contains an element of universality that removes any need to update it.  The original book by Ea de Queirz is as timely now as when he first wrote it.  Queirz also writes novels that are intensely ""visual"" (if such a word can be applied to writing) and uniquely capable of being adapted to film.  It's a minor gripe, and should not dissuade anyone from watching an excellent film, but it remains none the less.",1085443200,13,1556,4.649635036496351
1834268,4,B00008AOX5,"After seeing this film, I wasn't surprised to find out that representatives of the Roman Catholic Church had decried it.  That predictable response to any form of social criticism against the social institution of the church is a little tired.  As far as the movie goes, I found it to be an interesting story on how sin can turn us around.  Virtually every character in this film (yes, even priests!) is in some way compromised by sin in their life, skewing the productivity of their intentions.  In terms of my personal compromise, I thoroughly enjoyed the acting of Ana Claudia Talancn!  If you're in the mood for a film that displays issues of corruption, health, and faith...and then refuses to `tidy' them up in the end, preferring a conclusion of tension, then this film is for you!",1085011200,5,788,4.7226277372262775

In between the daily responsibilities Father Amaro meets with other priests and the people of the village.  One of the girls of the village, Amelia (Ana Claudia Talancn), seeks Father Amaro's attention as she falls in love with him.  These are feelings that Father Amaro desires, but they come with a price that he does not want to pay.

After you watch the movie you start to wonder exactly how does a ""man"" rationalize his own sins and does that man ever consider how God will view his soul and deeds?  The final scene where the young priest is content to let his transgressions be blamed on an innocent is really powerful.  This film is at it's best when viewed by a group and then discussed after.  A great topic is which priest has the greatest sin the one who aides rebels, the one who accepted blood money to build a hospital, the Bishop who takes money to allow others to cleanse themselves of sins, or the young priest who break his vows of celibacy because he views his job as profession?",1081987200,3,758,4.347517730496454

1834273,5,B00008AOX5,"""El Crimen Del Padre Amaro""(""The Crime of Padre Amaro"") is one of the greatest mexican releases of 2002.  It deservingly received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film.  It stars rising star Gael Garcia Bernal as Padre Amaro.  This film interprets and modernizes the 19th century book version beautifully.  It combines drama, romance, erotica, and religion wonderfully, offering an unforgettable experience that will keep the audience watching every scene closely.  Such controversial theme deserves much respect to the cast and crew.  Many twists and turns arise as the young priest and a woman begin a relationship.  Amaro risks his priesthood for such love and pleasure.  Every scene and detail is flawless.  Bernal proves in his lead performance that he continues to evolve as an actor as he has since his debut ""Amores Perros""(2000).  All other actors also performed their roles beautifully.  ""El Crimen Del Padre Amaro"" is a great film for those looking for something eyeopening or dramatic.  This is sure to please many.",1072742400,3,1031,5.219512195121951

This caused a big controversy not only in Mexico, but worldwide. The feelings of thousands of people have been hurt with this explicit film where its shows the reality of a part of the catholicism. Crowds demostraited their anger, right in front of the theatres where the film was playing. The Padre Amaro's crime is not an aisled  case, for the last decade we have seen too many cases around the world and in particular in USA where a crime has less impunity.",1067472000,3,673,4.471544715447155
1834276,5,B00008AOX5,"This was one of the best movies I have seen;
NOT because the acting was excellent, but it was!
NOT because the music was excellent, but it was!
NOT because the photography was excellent, but it was!
In addition to all the above, it spoke of a very real and present
danger existing in our societies today, so skillfully, and with such
excellence of production, and character and thematic
development that I will long remember the story, the feelings
of ALL the characters, and, most important of all, the POINT.
The REAL CRIME became evident in the early stages of the
movie: the sin of placing ego ahead of God, and the people to whom
one has voluntarily become a Shepard. Padre Amaro's youthful
amoral dedication to the development of his career (should have
been ""calling"") littered white lies that like mustard seeds
grew and grew until he became a spiritual disfigurement of what
he should have become. Placing extrinsics ahead of integrity,
Amaro's service to God and His congregation finally became a mockery.
This lesson hits a soft spot with me as I watch our present day ""public
servant"" shepards almost ubiquitously putting their own personal
interests ahead of their duties to the people. Greed in ambition
can be a dangerous thing, especially in the realm of service to the public,
be it religious, governmental, or charitable.
And, like a boil, it will ultimately be lanced.
This movie is a real credit to the Mexican film industry.

1834277,4,B00008AOX5,"This is definitely a controversial film, especially for Catholics both practicising  and those with a less than a traditional  belief system. Given the current problems of the church with molestations etc. this is something that only adds to the fire. Current Mexican heart throb Gael Garcia Bernal is in the lead role as Padre Amaro who begins the movie as a naive young priest and finishes the movie as a ruthless man who is no longer offended by the politics  and wicked ways of some churches.  Other notable actors and characters include the veteran Spanish actor, Sancho Gracia, who plays Padre Benito who is having  a less than secret affair with a woman  and who may have fathered a lovely daughter named Amelia. Amelia is a dedicated Catholic girl(in her teens?) but her love of Jesus has carnal overtones in the guise of the young padre Amaro who has entered the parish. The plot has been outlined various times so I'll deal with some of the controversey but begin with my own problems with the movie. First of all I believe Gael Garcia Bernal is less than credible in the lead role; however he does have an audience and sells tickets and DVD's. Don't get me wrong I can appreciate an attractive person in the lead  but  that doesn't mean that I'd like to see Madonna or Cameron Diaz portraying a young Mother Theresa! I can live with the choice for lead actor but some of scenes are worth bringing up if for nothing else to add to the controversy. There is an old woman in the movie who is one of the best characters, she is an eccentric, has her own brand of Catholicism,  has a bit of a following, the local gossip and who steals many of the scenes beginning with her introduction where she is ""singing"" in the church. There is one of her scenes that was particularly troubling and definitley controversial in which she takes her communion home after acting like she accepted it in church. This grossed me out and I found it sacreligious. She took the host, the blessed symbolic body and blood of Christ home and fed it to her cats!! Is nothing sacred? I know cats are Gods creatures too but please this is pushing the limits of tastes, no pun intended. What's next? Someone swindling a few bucks from the Sunday collection and siphoning the money off to have stray dogs and cats spayed and nuetered because there are so many roaming the streets? Or a renegade priest taking a few bottles of the church wine to the local  street alcoholics so they can have a drink? This particular scene was one done to just push peoples buttons. Some of the other issues "" brought up"" include  the priests involved in sexual situations, contrary to their vows of celibacy as though this were the norm. The point here being the hypocrisy that exists, hardly hidden  and accepted by parishiners as fact. Naturally the priest suggesting and condoning an abortion  to cover his sins and the resulting cover up was the main issue but there were others. There is a priest, Padre Benito who brings the Padre Amaro's conscience into question by practising liberation thelogy. The fact that he helps the guerillas,even at the risk of excommunication speaks to the greater issue of the role of the priest and the question of good verses evil. There are many other more settle messages brought up for the pensive viewer to contemplate but viewer beware. The directors commentary, which essentially was a conversation between Carrera  and Bernal, further pushing an agenda, was less than enlightening as they both were unfocused and constantly going off on tangents. Besides they both made it clear in the beginning that they were less than happy about doing the commentary and that it was a requirement. All in all this is a movie deserving of your viewing so that you can be the judge  and pull the redeeming qualities from this beautifully filmed thought provoking movie.",1058832000,14,3859,4.679468242245199
1834278,3,B00008AOX5,"This story as they say a modern remake of the 80s film Camilla, will really make you think. The controversey may not be as eye-opening for some viewers, but the themes in the movie are interesting to ponder.
Why do not both characters punished for their sins? Just the man? What dose this say about Mexican machismo?
How would God view true love? even when it involves a priest. These issues come and they make you think.

The beauty of the film is the way your perceptions of characters change as it goes on. The corruption of society seems pale to individual corruption.

1834280,3,B00008AOX5,"***1/2 How quickly the events in the news can inure us to the ugly realities of life.  In the wake of all those priest sex scandals that have come to light in recent times, ""El Crimen Del Padre Amaro"" comes across as more timely, yet less shocking, to us today than it would have had it been released a few years back.  This Oscar-nominated film from Mexico, written by Vincent Lenero and directed by Carlos Carrera, features priests who fornicate, priests who launder drug money, priests who arm guerrillas, priests who pay for abortions, priests, in short, who seem to do everything imaginable except what they were originally ordained to do.  Not only is the Church hierarchy in this film in bed with drug runners (as well as half the female members of the parish, apparently), but it even dictates to the local newspaper what it will report about the Church and where on the front page such stories will go.
It's safe to say that many devout Catholics will see this film as yet another anti-papist screed designed to further degrade the image of the world's most powerful religious organization.  But the makers of ""El Crimen Del Padre Amaro"" seem less concerned with attacking the Church than with examining the human frailties that motivate the characters' actions.  Part of their argument seems to be that the complexities of life and of human nature make it virtually impossible for anyone of flesh and blood to remain saintly for very long.  This is particularly true in a setting like rural Mexico where the day-to-day struggle for survival overwhelms all other concerns - spiritual as well as temporal.  Father Benito is the leader of the parish who rationalizes his dealings with the local drug dealers by arguing that ""bad money becomes good money"" when it is used in the service of the Lord.  How else is he going to get the funds necessary to build the new hospital for his people?  Father Natalio, an espouser of ""liberation theology,"" finds himself at loggerheads with Father Benito, actually arming the very guerillas who fight against those same drug lords.  Natalio suffers no qualms about having men killed if that is what is necessary to achieve his goals for his people.  Finally, Father Amaro, the focal point of the film, has his own demons to confront.  Barely out of seminary, this idealistic young man (played by Gael Garcia Bernal, one of the leads of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") arrives in town determined to make his mark as a priest who does good for his parishioners.  What he doesn't bank on is the corrosive effect of the corrupt system into which he is sent or his own susceptibility to the weaknesses of the flesh.  Being young and handsome, Father Amaro soon finds himself the target of an amorous young woman who confuses pious sentiment with plain and simple erotic desire.
What makes Father Amaro interesting is that he is never as righteous as we think he should be in the beginning and never as unredeemably corrupt as we think he should be at the end.  In many ways, he is just like anyone else who looks for the easiest way out for himself when the going gets tough.  Many viewers may want Amaro to assume the role of conventional hero, stepping in to right the wrongs taking place in this village.  Yet, he will not accept that role.  What makes the story tragic is not that Amaro is a man of potential greatness brought down by his own weaknesses or the machinations of others, but the fact that he is basically just an ordinary kid trying hard to be ""extraordinary"" (choosing the priesthood as his way of achieving it), yet lacking the intestinal fortitude and strength of character men must have if they hope to be great.  That Amaro slips so easily into the amoral role set up for him by the likes of Father Benito (even though the old priest seems to find some redemption at the end) is what gives the film its air of frustrating hopelessness.  Who, we are led to ask, will finally put an end to this vicious cycle?  We know it will not be Amaro.
In many ways, the filmmakers may be trying to do too much in this film.  Each of the stories involving the three priests could make an interesting movie in its own right.  As it is, we sometimes get the sense that the film, in trying to create a full-blown tapestry of Catholicism in Mexico, ends up giving short shrift to some of the more fascinating elements of the story.  So much time is spent on the sexual dalliances of Father Amaro and the girl, Amelia, that we don't really get to see enough of the other forms of controversy and corruption with which the film is dealing.  The Liberation Theology movement, in particular, is dealt with in rather too sketchy a fashion, leaving us generally puzzled and unenlightened on that topic.
The actors do a superb job bringing their characters to life.  In addition to the aforementioned Bernal, Sancho Gracia and Damian Alcazar are excellent as Amaro's fellow troubled priests and Ana Claudia Talancon is pretty and poised as the young girl drawn by lust, love and passion to this weak-souled priest.
Viewers will most likely find ""El Crimen Del Padre Amaro"" to be either a brave film or an offensive one, depending on which side of the religious divide they happen to come down on.  But after the recent stories in the news, very few of us should really be shocked by what we see here on the screen.",1055030400,10,5341,4.624338624338624
