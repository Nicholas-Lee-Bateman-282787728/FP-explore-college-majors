Instead, we see glimpses  of a gripping tale cut to the bone, insistent in its humbleness. Especially  telling are the simple faces of the minor players - for instance the  spine-chilling scene where we see close-ups of each soldier`s face before  they charge ahead to kill all newborn boys at king Herods command.

340787,4,6301640799,"No, neither the colorization nor the dubbing detracts from this director's vision of Christ in His earthly surroundings. The ancient middle east is accurately shown as a hardscrabble, rocky near-desert occupied by a fascist Roman army (much like Poland occupied by Nazi forces), and ruled by political and religious leaders sharing a common cynicism and corruption.
Children are everywhere in this movie, as they must have been back then; short lifespans encourage large families. The director's fascination with the faces of his actors is a useful tool that transcends language and time, as well as adding a genuine feel to his narrative. The clothes his actors wear are as shabby as they probably were 2,000 years ago.
I doubt if anyone would regard this movie as expensive to produce, which makes it even more remarkable. I also can't believe that Hollywood would ever deliver such a product today, if they could have back in 1964.

340801,4,6301640799,"I'm reviewing the original black and white Italian film, not the colorized, dubbed, and condensed version that is the main feature on the DVD.  This is a testament to the universality of the faith that such a beautiful and reverent film about Jesus Christ (dedicated to the late Pope Saint John XXIII) was made by an atheist.  A Marxist atheist.  A gay Marxist atheist.  Don't let this fact deter you from watching this wonderful film!

This film attempts, for the most part, to be faithful to the Gospel of Matthew, even going so far as to have the only dialogue in it be dialogue from the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible (I think the one exception is Jesus saying out loud the names of each Apostle, which I found very ""familial"" in Italian: ""Tomasso, Bartolomeo...."").

Because of this, it is a very cinematic and contemplative film, telling much of the Gospel through images (which is a tradition dating back centuries).  For example, it opens on the young Mary, Who says nothing at all (not through the entire film, because no dialogue of Hers has been recorded in this Gospel), but looks at Joseph by way of close-ups cutting back and forth.  Joseph looks uncomfortable, and then we see why, because Mary is pregnant, and clearly Joseph is not the father.  He walks away in discomfort, and then an angel (an actress who looks boyish, but in a good way) tells him not to be afraid to take Mary his wife, for the Child is of the Holy Spirit.  This is the first line of dialogue, that of the angel, because that was the first line of dialogue recorded in the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible.

Because of the silence, it gives us the opportunity to really contemplate what's happening, which is what is needed for a film about Jesus, and is especially welcome in a day and age where all too often in the media people talk like John Moschitta, Jr.  (If you don't know who that is, he was in FedEx commercials and Micro Machines commercials, and made two appearances on Sesame Street--he's the man that talks fast, like he has a flight to catch that's leaving in 30 seconds.  I like this when it's coming from him, but not when that's all I hear these days.  It makes me long for Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.)

I like the kind of everyday, yet somehow simultaneously mystical, feel of this film--just what a Jesus movie should be.  It is everyday in that it is a low-budget production--and yet that makes it feel more authentic.  For example, the peasants are actual Italian peasants, not actors (I get taken out of Jesus movies when it's clear we're looking at actors).  And when we see Jesus walking on water, it looks like He is actually walking on water--it doesn't look like a special effect!  You wonder, ""How did they do that?!""--which is exactly the right response for seeing Jesus walking on water.  I don't find I feel that way with too many depictions of this miracle on film, because I already know that Jesus walked on water, and I'm aware I'm watching a movie.  It's hard to put myself into the mindset of those who have no hindsight.

(Some might find it off-putting that there isn't always that much emoting coming from the actors.  Arguably that's a problem, but it could be worse: they could have been mugging for the camera, and they're not.  So I'm not complaining about that.)

The mystical aspect comes not only from the silence, but from the choice of music--there is an eclectic musical style for this film, and yet somehow it works here.  There is some drumming and chanting during the opening credits--it's with a beat, but I recall hearing ""in gloria"" among the lyrics, suggesting something religious.  During the Wise Men's visit to the Christ Child, a woman sings ""Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child"".  And there is just some strange humming with only a single instrument, and no real rhythm, almost like a protest song without any lyrics, just going along with images of what is being protested.  And yet somehow the music never feels out of place for me.

I also like this unique depiction of Jesus--maybe it's only a coincidence that this is by an Italian filmmaker, but I'm reminded of a drifter in a Spaghetti Western, except armed only with Truth, not with weapons, and clearly not afraid to use it, nor afraid of what mere earthly weapons can do to someone armed with the Truth.  Shouldn't all Christians be like that?  And it occurred to me that that's probably how they saw Jesus at the time, going from one town to another with His disciples.  Yet neither is this Jesus aloof: He smiles at the little children.  He is warm and loving--but He is also deadly serious and not afraid.  You can believe this Jesus is the Son of God, through Whom you were made, and through Whom all things were made.

And the scene where Herod orders the massacre of the innocents feels real--you know they wouldn't use real babies, but you don't see anything to give the indication that what we're seeing isn't real babies either, and that makes it disturbing, as it should be.  They're carried--they're dropped--they're killed.

Another excellent thing about this film has nothing to do with the film itself, only the language it's in.  Ever since I was a child I didn't understand why it said that Jesus said ""Take, eat: This is My Body"".  Who talks like that?  No one whose native language is English, certainly.  But while Jesus says the Italian equivalent of ""Take, eat"" here (""Prendete, mangiate""), it sounds grammatically correct (I've never learned Italian, but I took four years of Spanish, which is closely related).  In addition, this has nothing to do with the movie but the source material: with regard to the words of institution over the Chalice, I like Matthew's Gospel best, because it is the most complete.  In the Byzantine Rite of the Church, the words of consecration over the Chalice are almost identical to what they are in Matthew's Gospel: ""This is My Blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out [for you and] for many for the remission of sins.""  (The bracketed part is in the Byzantine Liturgy but not in Matthew's Gospel--it is unique to Luke's Gospel.)  And so I guess Matthew's account is my favorite account of the Last Supper in the Bible (though for the actual Crucifixion and Resurrection, I think I prefer John, which doesn't include the institution of the Eucharist at all).

There's another reason I like the depiction of the Last Supper here: the bread.  I thought it looked odd the first time I saw this, as I've never seen bread look like this, certainly not in a Jesus film.  But I've since read somewhere (I forget where, so I don't know how accurate this is) that historically, the unleavened bread would in fact have been corrugated, as we see here, and also that holes were punctured in it, again as we see here--something about making sure it got cooked evenly.  This makes the bread we see here look kind of like a bunch of giant waffle fries.  Anyway, what I read said that this made even clearer the connection between the bread and the Body of Christ, Whose hands and feet were pierced and Who bore the stripes of 39 lashes.  Especially knowing this helps me to appreciate the look of the bread (rather than just seeing waffle fries and that taking me, a Catholic Who believes in the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist, out of the film, as I've never seen bread that looked like this), so that this may be my favorite depiction of the Last Supper on film, at least of what I've seen.

Sadly, this film isn't perfect, which is why I docked one star.  I might not have done so if it hadn't been just at the most important part: the Passion.  Not that all of it is bad--the screaming of one of the men crucified next to Jesus, as the man is being nailed to his own cross, is VERY believable (important for a movie like this, but sadly lacking in a lot of depictions).  But as Jesus is walking the Via Dolorosa, with Simon of Cyrene carrying His Cross...I'm sorry, but I get the impression that what we're seeing is behind the scenes footage that somehow got left into the movie.  I don't say that's what happened, just that that's what it looks like: Jesus doesn't look like He needs help carrying the Cross, and the Crown of Thorns doesn't even muss up His hair!  The fact that He casually takes a drink doesn't help matters either, even though the drink was in Scripture.  Nor does His fake-sounding scream just before He gives up the Spirit help matters.  Fortunately the film rebounds after this: aside from the Resurrection being appropriately joyful (after we see the stone being removed all by itself--again, how did they DO that?!), when we see the dead Jesus wrapped in linens, it drives the point home that Jesus is dead, something it can be easy to forget when we know He's going to come back to life.  Yet another way in which we're transported not only back in time but with our memories erased so that we're experiencing this fresh, as people of the time would have.

Other than that, there is one bizarre choice, but I didn't think it was detrimental or took me out of the film, it's just kind of bizarre: the hats of the Jewish priests.  They look like bishops' mitres in a way, but really more than anything it makes them look like the chesspiece called a ""bishop"" than like real bishops.  I don't know what the point of that was, but again, it didn't bother me, just kind of weird.

All in all, so much of this film is gotten right, especially for not being made by a believing Catholic or any other kind of Christian, that I can forgive what's wrong with it easily, even the depiction of the Passion.  It's so mundane that it feels like people we might meet in our everyday life, yet so mystical that it feels like the greatest story ever told.  We feel like we're experiencing the events ourselves as they really happened, rather than seeing a performance of a story that people have known for 2000 years and are bored to tears by.  There is excellent use both of music and especially of silence, so we can contemplate what is really happening.  We get drawn into the emotions of things.  Jesus as portrayed here could so easily be the Son of God, human though He is.  And I really like the depiction of the Last Supper.

So why not take a look at this film and see for yourself?

God bless you all.

P. S.  What a wonderful tribute that director Pier Paolo Pasolini cast his own mother in the role of the Blessed Virgin Mary!

The product I'm reviewing is from the Water Bearer box sets.  Surprisingly this disc has both the full length b&w and the 90min color versions.  The b&w has stunning cinematography of which most scenes are shot on locations. The film is full of long static takes that bear resemblances to famous religious works of art. The story moves along at a brisk pace, through the entire gospel story, with the only long scenes involving some of Christ's parables and sermons.  Yet, even these are shot using different angles and backgrounds as if they were compilations of the same monologue spoken at different locations to a different gathering.
The color film is ok, but is obviously a compromise to reach an English speaking audience.  The color ruins the beautiful images that Pasolini lovingly frames.  Also, the shorter length takes away from the epic feel that is inherent in the telling of Christ's life.  The most glaring negative is the Hollywood narrative which plays out over each scene.  A typical example from the biblical epics put out by Hollywood to make sure everyone understood exactly what was happening.  I watched the b&w version first and immediately was taken by the fact that no narrative voice was used, nor is it necessary.

It succeeds exceptionally well in placing the viewer within the Gospel events, avoiding the artificiality of most biblical movie epics. Director Pier Paolo Pasolini is completely faithful to the text while employing the visual imagination necessary for his realistic interpretation"" (old(dot)usccb(dot)org/movies/g/gospelaccordingtostmatthewthe1966(dot)shtml).

As per Steven D. Greydanus, ""Some of the most intriguing artistic tributes to faith and religion come from nonbelievers....Pier Paolo Pasolini was an atheist, indeed a Marxist....In 1962 he came to Assisi in response to Pope John XXIII's call for dialogue with non-Christian artists. While there, he read through a book of the Gospels 'from beginning to end, like a novel,' later proclaiming the story of Jesus 'the most exalting thing one can read.'  As a result of this experience, Pasolini became consumed with the notion of filming the life of Christ straight from one of the Gospels, shooting without a screenplay and taking no editorial license with the text....Pasolini edits, but doesn't rewrite; he omits some scenes and rearranges others, but on a scene-by-scene basis he follows Matthew's dialogue almost verbatim, neither changing nor adding (A few very minor departures are allowed, such as putting Matthew's list of the names of the twelve disciples onto Jesus' lips.)....In the end, perhaps the most enduring achievement of The Gospel According to Matthew is an ironic one, given Pasolini's Marxism: No other life-of-Christ film is so contemplative, inviting the viewer simply to meditate on the life and teaching of Jesus"" (decentfilms(dot)com/reviews/gospelaccordingtomatthew).

This film is apparently an example of so-called ""Sword-and-Sandal"" - ""a genre of largely Italian-made Historical or Biblical Epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965....The terms 'peplum' (referring to the togas or robes which the ancient Romans wore) and 'sword-and-sandal' were used in a condescending way by film critics"" (Wikipedia).

I contacted Criterion but they did not respond.  I watched the extended black and white version of Legend Films' disc of ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"" and enjoyed this G-rated Pasolini superiorly to the lusty stories of ""The Trilogy"" (""The Canterbury Tales"" and ""The Arabian Nights"" are rated NC-17 or X while ""The Decameron"" was rated R).  I did not watch the colorized shortened version on the Legend disc and can not think why anyone would do that who appreciated the artist's integrity, except that we are talking about a film version of one of the Gospels of the life of Christ, and a lot of Christians out there today (as in Jesus's time as the film in so many ways so perfectly depicts) do not understand the life of an artist which Pasolini saw Jesus basically as and an outsider as Pasolini was outcast from the Communist party for homosexuality and was otherwise an admitted atheist and still chose this subject to film, but Christians today do not withstand a two and half hour black-and-white film in Italian with subtitles so easily when they can watch a bastardized version 90 minutes long and colorized.  Somewhere the word ""hypocrite"" in the film shows up more numerous times than when the cock crowed after St. Peter denied knowing Christ.  The crowing cock was just one more thing not interpreted from Pasolini's otherwise literal translation of St. Matthew's Gospel.  Even though Pasolini normally used many non-actors (or as the ""The Trilogy"" the same faces appear in different roles in all three films, so they are more annoyingly ""household faces""), he made a very wise choice in Enrique Irazoqui as Jesus.  I have never witnessed a better portrayal.  I understand the film was nominated for three Academy Awards including the music which I must comment was outstanding and well suited to the style of the lyrical aspect the film has with classical as well as folk/blues and the use of powerful silences that highlight some of the haunting images that Pasolini so economically presents that Hollywood, with all its riches, could never come as close to present so well, so simply.  And the simplicity is fitting, as any line of the Gospel reveals of such a complex thing.  Deservedly on many ""Ten Best"" Lists for 1964.

The colorized version is dreadful. It has reduced the running time of the original film and the colorization is not good. The dubbed English is at times unbearable.

Bad decision.  Clearly there are pervasive problems with quality control in the production of this DVD.  We watched it up to the point where Jesus entered Jerusalem leading up to his death (spoiler alert) when the DVD just locked up.  I could see no scratches, finger prints, or anything else on the surface of the DVD that might cause the problem, but I cleaned it anyway.  It made no difference.

I was hoping that the Legend Films release had something more to offer regarding the black and white original version, mainly better subtitles that don't wash out in some scenes, along with a better translation in some scenes as well.

It simply represents everything that is wrong with Christian marketing these days - the compromise of artistic integrity for a quick buck.

It is a muscular, unsentimental, and challenging presentation of the Gospel of Matthew-- and such a welcome alternative to Hollywood productions of the Jesus story. I was especially impressed by how Pasolini is able to compress the story to a manageable length without omitting too any important elements.",1298678400,3,408,4.927536231884058
340826,4,6301640799,"An extremely famous film about an extraordinarily famous Gospel, that of Saint Matthew, yet I am wondering what makes it different from so many other versions of that story. Even the music is not original. So what is? It is purely artistic, will I say, but what do I mean exactly?

First Pasolini decided to shoot his film in black and white, or if you prefer all in gray. I would say that projects us into the past at once. We are in an old story we all know by heart or nearly and since it comes from so far away it does not need any colors. We are color-blind when remembering the distant past.

Second the story is condensed essentially to the words of Jesus and the voice over of a narrator, or nearly just to that. Any other voice is particularly strong then, for example Peter denying his knowing Jesus three times. We don't need the cock after that.

This story telling technique is to make us jump from one episode to another with absolutely no link in-between. Ellipse upon ellipse, our knowledge of the story links up the pieces of the tale. The vision then can be hyper simplified. No special costumes, no special sets, no special effects either. Just plain, simple, even brutal facts, nearly too brutal to actually be moving. It becomes cold after a while.

Then the camera is used in the strangest way possible: slow long movements over vast distant landscapes alternate with close-up shots of faces or small numbers of characters. Very few scenes of action, violence or movement. We are nearly confronted to a still life that is so static that we are like turning the pages of a picture book or a book of engravings telling us the story.

In those nearly immobile pictures Pasolini adds speech, and nothing else but speech, no dialogue, just Jesus in a way reciting his own gospel and a narrator linking up the bits and pieces. In such a still, slow, nearly stagnant succession of scenes that makes you jump over from one to the next as if it were a slideshow you feel no emotion, no passion, just a message that is transmitted to you with as little interference as possible.

Some say it is a masterpiece. It might have been but today it looks slightly sallowish if not faded. It remains an impressive message but it misses the human dimension, even if Jesus is the Son of Man and in a way not human. Pasolini has invented with this film a Franciscan cinematographic Passion, but there is a lot more about Jesus than this grayish panegyric of poverty and the poor.

Pasolini outdid himself in the stark simplicity and beauty of inspiration that make up this film from the very first scene to the last. Pasolini's Christ is an activist and a charismatic preacher that would have ran into just as much trouble today as he did then. The details of costume, the architecture, the objects are all carefully selected to project the authenticity of the gospel and all look overwhelmingly real.

This is the antidote to all the Hollywood renditions that have obscured the story or twisted it completely into a fairy tale. My favorite scene is the expulsion of the merchants from the temple where we see Enrique Irazoqui as a virile, infuriated Christ. His acting is superb and just perfect for the role. The last supper is also a superb composition that Caravaggio would have been proud to paint. An absolute triumph that has withstood the test of time and is still unsurpassed today.",1250726400,3,1091,4.772486772486772

Two, the authenticity of the wardrobes and locations makes me think this is more in tune with how it really was when Jesus walked the earth. I get discouraged and disappointed with Hollywood as the Jesus films never feel authentic, no matter how hard they try. I think the secret here is in the simplicity of the film. Those were ancient times and this movie captures that simplicity. Third, the music is lovely and appropriate for every scene.

Now I'm no expert on dubbing and recordings and re-recordings, so I won't comment on that aspect of this dvd.

The miracles are handled with a genuinely moving simplicity which would have been ruined with more elaborate special effects.
I believe that the current English dubbing was created for showing in American parochial schools. Having seen the film in New York and Toronto in Italian with English subtitles, I don't believe that the current version was ever intended for theatrical release.

340841,5,6301640799,"The Gospel According to St. Matthew (otherwise known by its native title of ""Il Vangelo secondo Matteo"") is considered by many to be the magnum opus of famed and controversial Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini, and for good reason.  Even today, the film maintains an astounding 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, placing it in the hallowed critical company of the Godfather and To Kill a Mockingbird.  It would be a grievous mistake to overlook The Gospel simply because of its foreign pedigree (Italian, for those wondering).  Though, it's worth noting that this version has been dubbed into English.

The story is one with which many of you are familiar: the life of Jesus of Nazareth, as described in the Gospel of St. Matthew.  In crafting his narrative, Director Pasolini relied exclusively on that particular text, and the end result is an extremely faithful screen adaptation, without flowery prose, melodrama or the bluster we typically associate with a divinely inspired film.  Pasolini's goal, and one that serves the movie well, was to simply recount events and portray them as Matthew scribed.

The highlight of this DVD package is its colorization of this famous black and white film.  As the main selling point, then, we properly have high expectations for the end-result, and The Gospel certainly lives up to them.  Classic movies are a hobby of mine, and I've consequently watched and reviewed quite a few of these colorization efforts over the years.  Other than to assure you the colors good and natural (if not maintaining the character of many first generation true-color films), the only thing that I can say is that watching a colorized version of a black and white classic is a completely new experience.  Each scene and subject has a whole new character that isn't ""better"" or ""worse,"" but different.  I suspect that fans of the film, both new and seasoned, would appreciate the opportunity to view it with fresh eyes.

Since the production company apparently understood this, and presumably understood that many people would want to preserve the original film as it was, they've included the original black and white version on the same disc.  In this case, the original Italian release with English subtitles, and inclusion that really highlights the ""different experience"" aspect to the collection.  Additionally, the black and white version has been completely unedited, giving the viewer a truly original experience.

The second best part about these modern releases of cinematic classics is the bonus material, which was unheard of when these films were produced decades ago.  The bonus material on this DVD largely consists of a look at the life and work of Director Pasolini, a man as interesting and controversial as the films he made.

It's lost none of its power during the four decades since I first saw it. If ever a film aspired to the condition of poetry, this is it. And its worth remarking that the black and white only intensifies the experience of being thrust into antiquity free of the laboured veils of Hollywood remakes of the Christ story. What a supreme remove this is from Pre-Raphaelite sweetness in imaging Jesus. Here is a man amidst men and women, the toothless, maimed and infirm. His fierce gaze is something to behold. His language cuts to the bone. The earth itself is addressed with boney fragility. Authenticity has been striven for by the likes of Mal Gibson, but this work is in a class of its own; casting, set locations, pacing, it has the lot. I agree with the brilliant account reviewer, J Clark from NY gives including his gripe about the score...where I first heard Blind Willie Johnson and Missa Luba, by the way! Why the choice of gospels, Matthew in preference to Mark, for instance, is another question that a more theologically inclined bod than me might explain. But, this remains my favourite Pasolini.

340849,3,6301640799,"`The Gospel According to Matthew' is a humble, bare-bones film that accentuates authenticity.  Using rugged terrain and an intricate, stone village, famed Italian director Pasolini makes the scenes seem more real than any movie up to 'The Passion of the Christ'.  Without any name actors, the scenes envelop a simplicity that is the movie's hallmark.  This movie's Jesus is a sterner, more direct rendering than any in movie memory.  While I may prefer subtitle's to English overdubs, the movie is at least easier to take in.  However, the emotional appeal is lessened by their implementation of this method.  Indeed, the emotional range, while deliberate at key times, is often wooden.  Many instances people just stare, but then again they may be dumbstruck by Jesus.  Also, better judgment could have been used.  For instance, during Jesus's trial when there should have been more close ups.  Nevertheless, Pasolini does get to the heart of the message.  With scripture all but entirely in the script, one can hardly criticize the interpretations.  If there is an accent mark, he frequently comes up with children, a nice touch.  Unvarnished, 'The Gospel' doesn't have the glory of most modern films, but, even with the technical shortcomings, it is basic like scripture itself.",1174176000,4,1281,5.160194174757281

340853,5,6301640799,"Italian neo-realism and French nouvelle vague meet in this extraordinary film version of the Gospel According to Saint Matthew filmed in 1964 by Italian poet, novelist, filmmaker and political maverick Pier Paolo Pasolini. The dialogue is taken almost word for word from the Bible, and the cast is made up of non-professional actors, including the director's mother as the Holy Virgin. The music consists mostly of classical pieces by Bach, Mozart, Prokofief and Webern, but also African American blues and gospel.

Pasolini was an extraordinary figure; a member of the Italian Communist Party, he was anything but a party-line communist and he made enemies of both the left and right. Many of his films contain graphic sex and violence and are still controversial today. He was murdered (allegedly by a gay hustler he picked up, although many believe it was politically motivated) shortly after the release of his final film, the notorious ""Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom,"" which I have also reviewed.

Whatever one thinks of Pasolini's messy personal life or his quixotic political activities, the fact is that in this film he showed more care and reverence toward the scriptural text than many avowed believers. There is none of the gloss and glitz that mars even the finest Hollywood Biblical epics. Tonino delli Colli, who also did the photography for Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, frames each shot like a still photograph from my grandmother's old Bible. For once we have a Jesus with convincing Mediterranean features who does not look like Kurt Cobain.

In recent years it has been fashionable to portray Jesus as some sort of half-baked Zen Buddhist or Taoist (i.e., ""The Five Gospels"" by the Jesus Seminar; ""The Gospel According to Jesus"" by Stephen Mitchell). It is doubtful if the people of Israel, with their uncompromising belief in an implacable God who forbade all idol worship, would have been receptive to ideas stemming from Buddhism or Hinduism.

In contrast, Pasolini's Jesus is more akin to the liberation theology that was taking shape in Latin America at the same time: his Jesus is the spokesman for the poor, the outcast, the disenfranchised, drawing his disciples from the economically and socially marganized peasants of first-century Galilee. In Enrique Irazoqui's performance we have a Jesus who is more the stern judge than the compassionate healer, although he certainly is that too. Whatever one thinks of this interpretation, there is nothing in the film that is inconsistent with either a literal reading of the Scriptures or with what secular historians can tell us of first-century Palestine.

This film makes some genuine contributions to New Testament exegesis. For instance, before I saw this film I never realized how clearly the death of John the Baptist set the stage for Jesus' eventual execution. When Jesus hears the news, he sheds a single tear: he knows that he's next, that it's only a matter of time that the authorities who silenced John will come after him. By emphasizing Judas' growing unease over Jesus' message, Pasolini sets the stage for his subsequent betrayal, which so often seems to come out thin air.

In all, a beautiful and provocative film. The WaterBearer Films DVD which I used to own got stuck at the scene of Christ's entrance in Jerusalem, rendering it unplayable. Hopefully this budget version will be better in that respect at least. This is a film that belongs in everybody's video library.",1167868800,8,3468,5.064798598949212

Later, in the same moment that they were notified about that the actor who played Jesus Christ was member of the italian communist party they revoked the reward. In fact, this version of the Passion of Christ is still today the film that better has interpreted the idiosincrasy of the acts of Jesus. Pasolini give us an human portrait without tinsels nor hipocresy; this is: Jesus as human being, as philosopher and as man whose ideology clearly connects with the spirit of truthful communism, the essence of the primitive christianism.

At the same time, being aware of the late Pasolini's ideology and having heard his 1964 ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"" described with words such as ""naturalistic"" and ""humanizing,"" I feared it would amount to a materialistic, reductionist political piece. I was wrong. Rather, this black and white film focuses on the human drama of the Christ event without discounting the possibility of its transcendent aspects, relies not at all on special effects, and is photographed in such stark beauty that almost any still from it could hang in a gallery. If you appreciate the visual composition of Ingmar Bergman's movies, that alone would be reason to see this film that easily equals or exceeds those works' visually arresting quality. The cast members are also exceptional, especially those who play Mary as a young girl and Jesus. The opening shot of the Mary character's gazing straight ahead at what turns out to be Joseph conveys such a depth of mystery, sorrow, serenity and soulfulness through facial expression alone that this image could become a modern Mona Lisa. Pasolini's Jesus perfectly paces a role that would be too easy to overact or emasculate. In equal measure he expresses fearlessness, compassion, conviction and controlled fire, and I couldn't look away from him. The soundtrack effectively employs primarily classical or baroque music along with a smattering of American gospel-blues, and here Pasolini deserves an additional bonus point for using Blind Willie Johnson's ""Dark Was The Night Cold Was the Ground.""",1132704000,18,1950,5.174050632911392

340858,4,6301640799,"One hardly knows where to begin when discussing The Gospel According to Saint Matthew.  Aside from the religious aspects of the film, you have to talk about Pasolini's techniques and motivations.  While I didn't like certain aspects of the film, I certainly can't deny the fact that, as a Christian, this film moved me in a very powerful way.  What makes this so amazing is the fact that Pasolini is both a Marxist and an atheist (basically the anti-me).  I would go so far as to speculate that The Gospel According to Saint Matthew is both Marxist and anti-Catholic in terms of Pasolini's motives.  The Jesus in this film is definitely the poor man's Jesus who would seem to represent the Italian peasantry which Pasolini held in such high regard.

I can't say I'm in love with Pasolini's filmmaking technique.  The opening scenes of the film play like a silent film, with words few and far between.  Pasolini tells most of the early story through the faces of his characters (and I should mention that he depended heavily on regular people rather than actors in the cast - his mother, for example, plays Mary).  Pasolini is absolutely in love with pans and close-ups.  On occasion, the camera starts moving one way, then suddenly zigs and zooms in an entirely different direction - this, to me, is sloppy technique; either the cameraman started going the wrong way or else he decided on the spur of the moment to capture something entirely different than what was planned.  Once Jesus begins his ministry, the dialogue takes hold of the story, but the cinematography is always a prominent part of the presentation.  All of the panning yields blurred background images, for example.  More importantly, Pasolini presents his story from the viewpoint of a follower of Jesus; oftentimes, you have the equivalent of someone walking behind the action with a camcorder.  I found this rather annoying early on, but the technique works wonderfully once Jesus is put on trial and crucified, as you see events unfold from the perspective of a John the beloved or a Mary.  The music, while noticeably strange at first (e.g., ""Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child"" with its English-language lyrics and a later song that seems to have roots in 20th century blues), becomes nothing short of mesmerizing as the movie progresses toward the end.  Unconventional, thy name is Pasolini.

The film truly does tell the story of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection as recorded in the book of Matthew.  You won't see several well-known scenes of Jesus' life and teaching simply because they weren't recorded in the first Gospel.  Likewise, the trial of Jesus, his crucifixion, and his resurrection all feel a little rushed simply because Luke and John describe the scenes in much greater detail than does Matthew.  Still, the final scenes of this film are extraordinarily powerful.  One problem I had with the film, though, was the fact that Jesus came across as quite an angry young man throughout much of the film - but, of course, Matthew presents Jesus in a slightly different light than do Mark, Luke, and John.

I don't know much about Pier Paolo Pasolini, nor do I think I could figure the man out even if I did.  A half-hour look at the man is included on this DVD, and it certainly shows what a complicated fellow he is.  As I mentioned earlier, he is both an atheist and a Marxist with strong Communist ties.  His efforts with this film seem to be an attempt to take the Jesus of Matthew's Gospel and have him speak, in a strong socialistic sense, for the Italian peasantry of Pasolini's era (the film came out in 1964).  That, I believe, explains the anger I saw in Pasolini's Jesus, and Jesus' bitter denunciations of the religious hypocrites of ancient Palestine could, I would surmise, apply to the Catholic Church or any institution of authority in Pasolini's own time.  All I know for sure, however, is that this film is wide open for interpretation and debate.

The Lord truly does work in mysterious ways.  With The Gospel According to Saint Matthew, an avowed atheist and Marxist has given the world one of the most powerful film representations of the life, love, and sacrifice of Jesus Christ.",1119225600,16,4197,4.790277777777778
340859,5,6301640799,"Pasolini's film opens with a startlingly simple shot that holds within it a startling revelation; a young woman's face framed by an arch of dark hair, almost like an architectural construct, seemingly supporting the weight of the world and still behind her another arch, only this one is made of stone. Then a man, perhaps twenty years her senior is shown, staring, behind him stone ruins. Then again the young woman, only this time her face fills the entire frame. A face that is immediately recognizable even though we've never seen it before. A soft face, delicate mouth, and dark eyes that are plaintive, innocent and yet knowing. And now the face of the man fills the screen - a face filled with confusion, disappointment, pain and anger. No words are spoken and none are necessary. We understand the conversation; Joseph's young betrothed is with child and he has never lain with her. So powerful is this opening scene that pages of dialog could have been written and still have failed to convey the full meaning. Though Pasolini utilizes the Book of Matthew as his script, he employs the use of facial close-ups to tell his story. Faces etched with lines like poetry written across the barren, rugged and unforgiving landscape of ancient Palestine. Every face a different interpretation of an experience, and every experience gives us greater understanding. The isolation of individual experience to connect us to an inner voice - our own?

340860,4,6301640799,"Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew is brilliant.  The black and White footage, soundtrack, and sometimes lack thereof produces a sobering experience.  This film is not afraid to tell the story with gentleness, respect, and with mystery.

Pasolini's strength is he is not afraid to be quite and not burden certain moments with background music (something missing by many of today's top filmmakers.  Yet, when music is need, he inserts it at the right moment for the correct effect.  The black and white film also adds to the film; it says this is ""real history"" and at the same time, it is ""mystery history.""  The person playing Jesus dos not over act, and plays with a humility that is respectful.  The Last Supper is probably one of the least successful scenes shot in this film.  The crucifixion scene is well done, but like most films about Jesus the Christ, the resurrection scenes are under done.

Ironically, this budget version boasts a slightly better transfer than the thirty-dollar deluxe edition.

340863,5,6301640799,"Filmed in Southern Italy in rocky hillside villages and along the coast, Pasolini's ""Gospel"" has the feel of a silent film, with its long close-ups of its cast of non-professional actors, which include Susanna Pasolini, the filmmaker's mother, and how the camera loves these rough, beautiful and distinctive faces...it is like a moving tapestry of Renaissance paintings, and a visual artist's dream film.
Enrique Irazoqui's Jesus, with his lofty forehead, thick eyebrows that meet over his nose, and coal black eyes, is stern and compelling, and recites the Gospel with strength and mettle.
Released forty years ago, the quality of this black and white film is gritty, which adds to the harsh depiction of the life and the landscape. Though much less ambitious, it reminds me a little of Tarkovsky's ""Andrei Rublev"", and it has the same pacing (especially in the first hour) and gravity. The soundtrack also shows signs of age, and includes Bach, Mozart, Prokofiev, Webern, some American spirituals (""Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child"" during the Manger scene), Kol Nidrei during the Last Supper scene, and Missa Luba. There is also a biting wind, whooshing and whistling though much of the film.
The tape that I own is dubbed, and this is the only instance where I don't find dubbing intrusive. Since the dialogue is literal and familiar, and many scenes are purely visual, the dubbing frees one to just take in this marvelous interpretation of St. Matthew's Gospel, which is sometimes simple and sometimes quite savage (the Massacre of the Innocents is chaotic); a must see for anyone interested in Christianity, and students of film and the graphic arts.",1078099200,13,1664,5.076642335766423

340866,5,6301640799,"This is one of the most astonishing films I have seen: probing, complex, lyrical, and at times emotionally overwhelming. NOTE: Do not blame WaterBearer for the poor-quality DVD; the Pasolini Foundation, which controls the film, provided the print and also vetoed chapters to encourage viewers to watch it only in its entirety. The overly edge-enhanced image is improved by turning your TV's sharpness setting to its 'blurriest.'
Can you imagine a less likely candidate to make what, after 40 years, may still be the greatest and most moving film about Jesus Christ? Pasolini was not only a gay Marxist but a devout atheist. His fascination with Jesus may have connected with his most personal theme, that of the outsider (with his artistic, political and sexual nature, he saw himself as the consummate outsider). Although one of Italy's leading intellectuals, he also moved among the laborers, indigents, and hustlers (some of whom were his lovers, not to mention the inspiration for his early poetry and novels), whose counterparts two millennia earlier had walked with Jesus.
Jesus's story also let Pasolini explore the complexities of real-world politics even while recreating an ancient culture with astonishing immediacy. He also relished the opportunity to play with a vast, and eclectic, artistic tradition, from Jean-Luc Godard's striking documentary style in ""the two trials of Christ.... to painting... Piero della Francesca (in the Pharisees' clothes), Byzantine art, Christ's face like a Rouault, etc.""
We also see El Greco not only in some compositions but in the intriguing casting of Enrique Irazoqui, a Catalan economics student, as Jesus. Pasolini had also considered such young, subversive literary lions as Jack Kerouac and Yevgeny Yevtushenko. With Pasolini's encyclopedic knowledge of all the arts, you could go on indefinitely trying to unravel the cultural allusions which make up just one strand of the film's rich texture.
The result, as they say, is history. It is like no biblical picture seen before; a quantum leap beyond the artificiality of, say, King of Kings, both De Milles's silent version and Nicholas Ray's 1961 remake, and later pictures like Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ are inconceivable without Pasolini's model.
Pasolini had the uncanny gift for using the simplest, most economical means to bring his vision to life. Some of the locations are breathtaking, from an enormous city which seems to grow out of a mountainside to the surreal wasteland where Satan tempts Jesus (filmed on Mount Etna). By imaginatively selecting these locales - and not having to build sets - Pasolini powerfully recreated the feel of the ancient Middle East at a tiny fraction of the cost of a Hollywood production.
He also took enormous pains to cast exactly the right faces. Radically, he chose real farmers and workers to enact their historical counterparts (instead of John Wayne playing a Roman centurion as in The Greatest Story Ever Told). Perhaps the film's most intriguing aspect is that all the characters seem drained of an inner emotional life (which elsewhere Pasolini explores rigorously). This is sacred material presented in the style of legend. This visual and performance approach matches Matthew's prose to perfection. But there could also be more provocative reasons for it.
Take the Sermon on the Mount montage, consisting entirely of close-ups of Jesus preaching with immense force - the background reflecting each changing verse. (The footage came from the abandoned sacred-style approach; Pasolini ingeniously integrated it by using sharp editorial rhythms.) Here as throughout the film, Pasolini's Jesus is both earthly and otherworldly, harsh and tender. And although his inner life remains completely opaque, he emerges - perhaps in part because he has been 'de-psychologized' - as a figure of power but also complexity and ambiguity. Pasolini was forever picking apart the discrepancies not only in society - including religion and politics (as seen in Accattone and Hawks and the Sparrows) - but in himself. Here we see the ""tough"" Jesus, who ""comes not to bring peace,"" smites a fig tree, violently hurls moneychangers out of the Temple, and warns people that they are either ""with me or against me."" But we also see the Jesus of love and compassion, who heals the sick, treats children with affection, and performs miracles (most are breathtaking, reproduced with the simplest means, as when he walks on water).
The only aspect of this magnificent film which does not work for me is the self-consciously eclectic (and Oscar-nominated!) use of music, which extends from Bach to Prokofiev to folk music. Pasolini wants this polyglot score to create subtle, and shifting, tensions between the world of ancient Judea and our own, but its incongruity and repetitiveness are sometimes distracting. By contrast, the use of silence is stunning. He communicates so much in the wordless opening scene between the pregnant Mary and her baffled husband, just by their faces and postures. These are people truly, yet to them confusingly, touched by the divine. He also captures the tactile reality of their world (you can feel the stones), even as his simple but striking compositions connect his own vision with such Renaissance masters as Giotto. This is filmmaking at its most subtle, resonant, and - while acknowledging the long tradition of Christian motifs in art - original. Pasolini brings together history, art and his own probing genius to depict Jesus in all of his humanity and divinity.",1070064000,137,5545,5.238470191226097

The only drawback is with the subtitles. Many times the lightness of the film made it impossible to read what was being said. This is partly why I gave it three stars, also while viewing the film, when Herod sends his men out to kill the children, there was audible laughter from my classmates, which suggest the scene was not quite plausible.

Alas, the transfer on this DVD isn't worth a recommendation.  Considerable flicker and film artifacts make the picture a real eye-stabber; the soundtrack is frequently muffled, and the musical cues are garbled.
As with most Italian films of the time, sound is ""post-synch"" (which is to say it's dubbed in).  The dubbing is no worse than you'd find in a Fellini film, but no better.
The sole extra is a European TV documentary from the early '70s.  It's in pretty deplorable condition, and is featured on all the ""Pasolini series"" DVDs.

340869,3,6301640799,"This movie, by one of Italy's premier directors, was filmed in the early 1960s with many non-professional actors.  By doing so, I feel that he kept the emphasis away from the star actor and placed the emphasis on the story.
If you are a fan of action and special effects, then this movie is not for you.  Also, if you are looking for historical accuracy, the soldiers' uniforms don't quite fit the time.  The focus of the film is on the words being spoken and on the reaction in people's faces.  The camera moves from face to face in a crowd so that you can see how the events are affecting us all.
Although different versions exist, I chose the one with subtitles so that I could focus on the camera work.  This may not have been a good choice.  The translation was more King James-ish so you had plenty of ""thee"" and ""thou.""  There are some misspellings, which can be a little distracting.  Most distracting though is the white lettering with the black and white background.  In some scenes, you can read what all is being printed.

340870,4,6301640799,"Basically, the title is self-explanatory: the gospel according to the Scriptures, about Jesus, in the book of St. Matthew. This was Pasolini's first major production - Accatone was his debut. St. Matthew utilizes a throng of unknown Italian actors that acquired recognition after the film was released. However, amid this interesting quality there seems to be a clashing between the Latin physiognomy in a Biblical Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the film appears to exhibit many anachronisms: A Blues singer humming incidental music, traffic sounds in the distance, street settings resembling 1960 Rome, etc. Likewise, the actor playing the Son of Man looks like a cross between Andy Garcia and Al Pacino ---get a load of the heavy brows.
Despite these minor traits, altogether, the film stands as another great retelling of the birth, death, and resurrection of the Messiah himself. In addition, the film presents a more profound examination of the gospels. Is Pasolini offering a straight-faced story of the Lord or is he telling it with biting scorn? These questions are brought up and the viewer can look at it as either ""the greatest story ever told"" or as a satirical metaphor on Christ and dogma. To my knowledge, Pasolini had always questioned theology. Be it his famously controversial (some say blasphemous) lament for the near-death Pope or his subsequent film Theorem: these both revealed Pasolini's steadfast philosophy.
Having some knowledge of the Scriptures would definitely help getting through St Matthew. Although, after seeing the film, one may want to go back and reread parts of the New Testament and then re-watch the film. My only complaint about St Matthew is that the subtitles are barely readable, although the re-mastered version may have remedied this flaw - beats me, I only own the original edition. Above all, St. Matthew works as both a creative adaptations for art-house film lovers (or Pasolini fans) and as a family film.",997574400,7,1951,5.177215189873418

There is none of the bombast that afflicts Hollywood's attempts to tell the Jesus story. The temptation most directers seem to have for angelic choirs and the ""wonder and awe"" of God was ignored. Instead this was a genuinely touching portrayal, far closer to the Jesus portrayed in the gospel itself. Particularly poignant is the moment when Peter realises he has denied Jesus.

To counter critics of the severity of my review, you find elsewhere, if you care, my review of Mamma Roma.....I consider it a 5-star masterpiece.
The greatness of neo-realism resides in its combination of great acting skills (the great Anna Magnani in a heartbreaking performance) and a myriad of non-actors that give a certain curious challenge to the portrayal of everyday.life.
Having said that, we know that most of can sustain, given the right direction a scene or two in a role that is not too demanding. That is because we spend our entire lives ACTING, whether consciously OR unconsciously, and to different degrees of narcissism (not to mention success!). Even the homeless person on the street has ""memorized"" his ""stump speech""----let us not go there what with the present endless debate in America and its ""artful"" politicians.

In this case, out of sheer arrogance or some stupid idealism Mr. Pasolini decided to dedicate more than 2 hours to one of the most taxing, cheaply pseudo-intellectual of all films in memory----and I have watched the very finest in the long history of American and international Cinema.
The movie was clearly made on pennies (not in itself a liability), and the direction is appalling.
One sad thing that comes to mind, heartbreakingly so is that all of these peasants ( were they all?)---apart from the figure of Jesus must have unquestionably been paid a pittance for their work-----and of course, Pasolini went on to reap the rewards and not give one single thought about sharing any proceeds with these poor souls..

Aesthetics:
Surely, 2,000 years ago there were no dentists, but the fact that Mr. Pasolini chooses the most grotesque of ""smiles"" is an act of manipulation and nothing else.
The fact that PIER selects the UGLIEST of faces (or more to the point the lighting that makes them look monstrous) is yet another manipulative effect, all in the name of ""realism""........This is no critique of beauty versus ugliness, this is about steering your audience towards shock value.

I grew up ""catholic"" (big quotes) and every Good Friday we were given the same ration of Hollywood, Cecil B. Demille drivel (not without its cheesy pleasures). I cannot say these were not at least  VISUALLY beautiful (say, ""Song of Songs""), but that ends the whole of the aesthetics problem.

On to the REAL merits of a film like this....
""Actors"" begin by staring at the camera endlessly---------let us emphasize endlessly, but with the important caveat that NOTHING, virtually NOTHING offers us expressiveness. Indeed, what we contemplate are faces that are CLUELESS and baffled----baffled we start becoming as more and more of this develops.
If you have no idea of the life of Christ, you will be given a greatly distorted view, Pasolini ""artfully"" rendered.
The movie that I saw, om TV and pay-per-view was DUBBED, but I seriously DOUBT that the original italian was delivered in any different way (an analogy is Fellini's films, which are given a disemboweled feel to them, but mostly those from his ""depraved"" period where anything goes, the antithesis of this film). The lines are recorded in the studio, in a magnificently stilted way, virtually READ, and during all the passages where Jesus is to be at his most charismatic you know that NOBODY would have followed this FOOL. (We will not go into issues of historical revisionism since then there is no reason for this movie, as it has been proven quite effectively that Jesus is a figure of lore---indeed one of the greatest, most perplexing events in human history---and I am decidedly NOT a conspiracy theorist------but being an agnostic, none of that matters at all. The fact is that the Gospels are filled with an amount of humanism that unquestionably changed the world-------if taking centuries for such a thing to happen..
There is no doubt on my mind that Pasolini had seen all that Hollywood ""trash"" and decided to go to the opposite extreme.
But when, not only do you have performers read their lines in a studio, BUT you leave large chunks of the story out, not to mention its greatest and most dangerous flaw, you know you are dealing with an inflated ego that wishes to supersede the historical cinematic past.
The VIA CRUCIS (also known as the seven-stations of the cross---and I don't mean Mal Gibson's grotesque blood-fest!) is, perplexingly, left out entirely. This is one of the most beautifully humanistic moments in the history of Christ.
More importantly, shiveringly so, is Pasolini's COMPLETE lack of nuance when dealing with the extraordinarily subtle issues that go into the outcome, which is that the Jews ""kill"" Jesus. To make it short, Jesus is a jew and the small jewish community is terrified of its master, ROME. Anything  can tilt the events against the Jews. And suddenly this RABID, angry, violent, exquisitely megalomaniac man appears before them, creating mayhem. And...he refuses to show his main card, his miracles, to the Jewish establishment. I think that most of us, given such a context, and hanging by the skin our teeth, would have had him killed. The Jews are portrayed in the least sympathetic of ways. By the way, I am NOT Jewish, but have the greatest respect for them.  ONCE AGAIN, in the history of so much media, an uncultivated person leaves the theater with the clear idea that the Jews killed Christ. Well YES, they actually convince the Roman authorities to kill one of them, a madman for all they know. A fellow JEW.
Pasolini was a devoted Catholic------the magnificently bizarre contradictions of this film if he indeed was NOT an anti-semite prove THE FILM to BE  anti-semitic-------not in any way blatantly so, but what do you get when growing with Mussolini?.......perhaps more than a few ""snatches"" of that monstrous' ""intellectual""  propaganda. As we have come to know more and more, a Marxist's agenda differs very little, ultimately, with that of a fascist's one...It took many of us to figure that one out, no? Castro, anybody? Pasolini was one more phony ""Communist"" reaping the benefits of very generous materialist  comforts while spewing ""equality"" from a very safe place. It takes quite a compartmentalization to separate the artist from the BUFFOON.
Finally, right after Christ's death there is no ""recorded"" earthquake that destroys the ""favela"" built on a hill.
It is only a darkening of the skies which lead  Roman soldiers to be perplexed and suddenly turn ""Christian"".
Finally, those that will try to defend the film by way of insisting that this is the "".......according to St. Mark"" and no more miss the point. When you align all four  gospels---one next to each other------you can see that the differences are in NUANCE, not plot.

That this work of UTTER MEDIOCRITY has been lauded over the course of 50 years or so, remains as problematic as Bunuel's ""...discreet charm........."".
This is an exercise in hubris, an amateur work, irresponsible, sadly anti-semitic, but most importantly when looking for  inspiration from christianity and his leader will find you confronting, alas..........absolute STERILITY...........

ASIDE: the movie contains, at different moments, the most beautiful seemingly African/Brazilian music. It is spellbinding, and I would be honored if anyone will send me a note telling me what it is if they know!",1455667200,,7394,5.014669926650367
