8422877,5,B004CA9ERO,"I have been practising Wing Chun for 24 years and have read many books and tapes before. This series is by far the best I have come through! First, it starts out by explaining clearly the concept and purpose of each form, then of course the demonstration of the form, but yet the applications of the form is the best part. It shows you how to apply the Wing Chun concept rather than individual movement, in addition, there are extra topics such as gates theory, facing theory, how to generate extra power etc. Seems like Benny has made no reserve of his knowledge about Wing Chun! If you are a Wing Chun practitioner, this series will certainly broaden your mind, enjoy it!",1204416000,2,673,4.524590163934426
