There has never been a show better than Cheers, it set the standard for all sitcoms that followed it.  It is a piece of American History.  Buy it, buy it, buy it!",1048982400,3,317,4.305084745762712

1854957,5,B00008NV4G,"One of the best seasons of One of the Best Shows February 28, 2003
The acting and writing is some of the finest to grace the airwaves. Diane as played brilliantly by Shelly Long is a real treat. It took many characters to try to replace the vacuum left after she departed the series. In truth the show was not the same without her, but the entire series is well worth collecting. The show is a wonderful depiction of a diverse group of customers and employees that come together in something of a surrogate family in Boston Bar. This portion of the series also functions as a great romantic comedy fueled by stellar chemistry between Diane and Sam as polar opposites that attract. Very sharp humor and great dialogue punctuate the series. One of the ten best television shows of all time. The best TV DVD package released to date. These shows are highly repeatable and worth owning.",1046390400,16,882,4.5886075949367084

I had a previous copy that I purchased from Amazon several years ago that mysteriously disappeared from my collection, so I finally bought this as a replacement. I was expecting a nice slip cased set like my original Season 1, but this was just a regular flimsy case. One of the DVDs wouldn't even stay on the plastic ring.

1855722,5,B00008NV4G,"I used to watch Cheers religiously when I was younger, but I hadn't seen it in many, many years due to a combination of lack of interest and the decrease in air time as newer sitcoms replaced it on many stations where it had run in syndication. Then, not long ago, I caught a few episodes on some obscure cable channel, and found as I watched several in a row that Cheers was an awesome show. It didn't take  long to order Season 1 on DVD, and after I got it, it didn't take long to watch all of Season 1 on DVD. The strength of the writing and acting was unsurpassed by any comedy from the '80's. Just look at all the talent, with Ted Danson, Shelley Long, George Wendt, Rhea Perlman, and so many other great TV personalities who were involved. Also, being a Boston Red Sox fan, I always thought it was cool how the show was set in a Boston bar run by a former Red Sox pitcher, and that Danson played Sam Malone like he was born for the role. I don't know of any other actor from back then, or from today, who could play such a complicated character on a comedy show. He was a caveman, but he was also really smart. He was a womanizer, but he was also sensitive. He enjoyed a good laugh, but he was also serious when he needed to be. And, on top of all that, he was a recovering alcoholic. You just don't find great characters like that on sitcoms anymore. Then you have his chemistry with Shelley Long's Diane Chambers, which turned into one of TV's most memorable will-they-or-won't-they storylines. The ensemble was already amazing from the outset, with Norm and Cliff, Carla, and Coach adding a nonstop flow of jokes and gags. Season 1 also has excellent bonus features, including a really nice interview with Ted Danson in which he's incredibly warm and nostalgic reminiscing about the show and his character. If you ever enjoyed watching Cheers or just like '80's sitcoms, Cheers Season 1 is one of the best sets you will find.",1453161600,,1934,4.372222222222222

1855893,5,B00008NV4G,"There are few shows that come out of the gate with a bang like Cheers does, most take a few episodes, if not a season, to get their bearings. Additionally, there is little of the cognitive dissonance that comes when characters change so much over the length of a long series that you barely recognize them in the earlier episodes. Here in the first season, the characters - Sam, Diane, Norm, Carla, Coach, and Cliff - are all at their sweetest and most vulnerable - even chronically-hotheaded Carla shows her human side once and awhile. They will all become more obnoxious as the show goes into its later seasons - with the possible exception of Norm, who mellows. Watch for the episode where Norm dashes across the bar to check out a sexy woman's legs passing by on the street - and then how he rushes over to light her cigarette when she enters the bar - it's something later Norm would never have the nerve (or the energy) to do.

The complex relationship between lowbrow ex-athlete bartender Sam and snobbish perpetual student and slumming barmaid Diane is the underpinning of the series, and the strangely electric chemistry is there from the get-go. Rumor had it the actors didn't get along in real life, but if so, they certainly deserved all their acting accolades because they look at each other with real affection - and undeniable attraction. The characters are flirtatious but just friends until the last episode of the season - and you can see their friendship deepen over time. This lends credibility to when the polar opposites finally end up in a clinch.

However, the seeds of their dysfunction are already there - Sam, while honest and loyal to a fault with his friends, is pathologically emotionally unavailable to women - and Diane is a co-dependent who thinks its her duty to get in there and teach him some morals and solve all his problems. (If you notice, Sam never takes one ounce of interest in Diane's everyday problems - he merely wants to bed her.)

Dysfunctional as it is, the sexual chemistry is palpable and it's what drives the series.

Sam seems to lose brain cells as the show goes on - but in this first season, he matches intellectual Diane barb for barb. He also has a charm about him in the first season that makes Diane's attraction to him (as well as his success with the ladies of Boston) completely realistic - unfortunately, this charm descends into one-dimensional buffoonery in the later seasons (especially in the Rebecca Howe seasons - which I can't watch).

A few of the jokes are hoary and repetitive (How often can Diane call Sam stupid? How often can Coach take something literally?) but for the most part, they stand up amazingly well. And where else are you going to find a sitcom that finds the funny in topics like Schopenhaur and John Dunne?

Cliff is but a footnote in the first season, his character will become more integral later on - but it's impressive to think he reportedly made up his character on the spot during a failed audition for Norm.

The series ends with Sam and Diane in a huge, hysterical argument that culminates in a passionate kiss, and I really don't think any two characters have ever done that kind of thing better. It's got to be one of the funniest, yet most touching, and also most sexually exciting scenes ever filmed for TV. (The defining moment where Sam yells 'How do you think it feels to be attracted to someone who makes you sick?' is surely one most of us can relate to.)

[Note: While it's no secret that the Sam/Diane relationship was an homage to Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn and '30s screwball comedies - the writers seem to overdo it during the 'Showdown' two partner finale and their big argument, which has Sam emitting lines like 'I've always wanted to pop you one!' and Diane actually saying things like 'I'm the best thing that's ever happened to you, and you're too stupid to realize it!' For characters who normally have such edgy wit, it's like they were suddenly thrown into a wayback machine for their ultimate clash. Somehow the chemistry between the actors makes it seem fresh though.]

The first season just makes you want to dive into the second season, which plumbs the discord between Sam and Diane even more winningly and to bigger laughs.

They just don't make 'em like this anymore.",1446854400,3,4303,4.672391017173052

1856159,5,B00008NV4G,"Watching Season 1 over 30 years after it premiered, I can see that is as fresh as it ever was. The writing can't be beat. Each character has a compelling story and all are given great lines to speak. The Sam/Diane attraction is so fully realized, I kept thinking one of the writers had to have a background in psychology. Even smaller scenes with supporting characters (the very moving scene between Coach and his daughter) pulse with life. Although Cheers went on for, I believe, 12 seasons, it was never as good for as in those early seasons. Shelley Long's Diane Chambers was one of the greatest television characters of all time and, sadly, she never found one as good after she left at the end of Season 5.

1856378,4,B00008NV4G,"I think it would be impossible to have lived in the 80's without having heard of the sitcom Cheers.  The characters were used for everything from a Disneyland birthday special to introducing the Superbowl.  Even now, it is a well-known classic of the genre beloved by many people.  While I have seen maybe a third of the episodes, I have always enjoyed the show, so I recently decided to start from the beginning with the season 1 DVD set.

The show is set in Cheers, a popular bar in Boston, Massachusetts.  It's owned by Sam (Ted Danson), a former relief pitchers and former alcoholic.  The staff includes Carla (Rhea Perlman), a short tempered waitress and Ernie ""Coach"" Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto), Sam's former coach who helps tend the bar and has taken one too many hits with a baseball over the years.  The pilot brings a new waitress to the bar in the form of Diana (Shelley Long), a professional student who is dumped by her professor boyfriend at the bar.  Her cultural touchstones are very different from her new co-workers and the patrons.  Round out the cast are bar regulars, accountant Norm (George Wendt) and mailman Cliff (John Ratzenberger).  What's interesting to note is that John Ratzenberger isn't in the main credits this season.  He guests stars in every episode, however, and is promoted to regular status in the second season.

There are lots of laughs over the course of the 22 half hour episodes of the first season.  Carla's attack on an obnoxious Yankees fan almost costs her the job, Diane takes a stand against female exploitation in the Miss Boston Barmaid contest, until she wins.  Coach is upset by his daughter's obnoxious fiance.  On Christmas Eve, a stranger wanders into the bar and claims to be a spy.  Norm uses Cheers to host his annual office party - a party with a toga theme.  And a buddy from Sam's professional baseball days comes out of the closet at Cheers, causing the regulars to wonder if the clientele of the bar will change.

But the heart of the show, especially during the first year, was Sam and Diane's relationship.  Their relationship is nothing new on TV - two people who are complete opposites trying to deny their feelings while impressing each other at the same time.  It's familiar ground, but the chemistry between Shelley Long and Ted Danson is amazing.  A simple exchange between them leaves you wondering just when they'll realize their attraction.  This is the biggest constant, popping up in just about every episode, although it does become the focus of some of them, like the one where they agree to set each other up on blind dates, or the two part finale where Sam's brother comes to town and appears to be sweeping Diane off her feet.

With much of the focus this year being on Sam and Diane, it might be easy for the rest of the cast to get lost in the background, but that never happens.  True, the characters are still being defined this year, but that's true with just about any show in its first season.  The acting by all the regulars is great.  They are making these characters their own right from the start, and it's this group of characters that were the core of the show for its eleven year run.  Even so, it takes a little while to fall into the rhythm of the show and truly come to love them.

Some of the staples of the show were in place right from the start, like everyone yelling out ""Norm"" as he walks in the door or his lines as he goes to his normal stool at the bar.  Carla's already complaining about her kids even as she becomes pregnant with another one (since Rhea Perlman was really pregnant with her first kid).

The show famously struggle in its first year.  (It's often used as an example of a show being given time to grow since by today's standards it wouldn't have lasted all season.)  I noticed while watching this season that the jokes were a bit slower in coming.  Maybe that has something to do with it.  I'm certainly not saying this season isn't funny; I laughed plenty of times.  What I mean is that sometimes the jokes required a bit more set up than just one straight line.  I actually like this.  It makes the humor seem more real when every other line isn't a joke.  In some ways, this is a very intelligent sitcom, which is ironic since it is set in a bar.

Speaking of setting, I'm trying to think of they left the bar once all season.  If so, it was very brief.  Almost every episode takes place completely in the main bar, the back room, and Sam's office.

Having watched the show randomly in reruns over the years, I was not too familiar with Coach.  He's your typical not quite all there sitcom character, but he's very lovable.  He gets some of the best lines of the season as his nearly constant confusion is always fresh and funny.  You know it's coming, but you never quite know when or how.  And underneath it all is a sweetness that makes you truly love this guy.

The 22 episodes from this season are all here on four discs.  They are in stereo and full frame.  The picture and sound aren't super outstanding, but for a show that is almost 30 years old, they work.  I don't remember anything about the quality that really bothered me.  Disc four does have a few extras, although most of them are compilations of greatest moments centering on certain characters.  We get three of them, one for Sam and Diane and their insults, one for Coach, and one for Norm.  Rounding out the extras are a very brief interview with Ted Danson and a trivia game.  All of these are filled with clips from the season you've just watched, so there isn't much point to them.

The disappointing extras aside, season 1 of Cheers still brings the laughs.  The show is still building this year, but it's already enjoyable.",1432339200,,5731,4.51603498542274

1856386,5,B00008NV4G,"""Endless Slumper"" is often under appreciated in the Cheers series but it deserves special mention and praise. This is because it shows in a humane and understated way the struggle Sam had to stay sober when he loaned his lucky bottle cap and didn't get it back. Though Sam and Diane are mostly known for their sharp banter and well noted chemistry, Diane is not concerned with her usual high blown rhetoric and witticisms here. In this episode, she sees Sam at a point of crisis and does all she can to support him in his continued sobriety.

Diane gets a bad rap but look at her background. She grew up rich but isolated. She took comfort in books but in her loneliness, she had much less practice relating well to other people. She was used to taking an academic approach since reading comforted her but as she so often found, that approach did not always translate well to real human relationships. Her openness and compassion were always there but her antagonists were largely blind to her best qualities. When Sam pours himself a beer and stares it down as he tries so hard not to drink it, Diane is completely focused on Sam's battle and the love, empathy and caring in her face is unmistakable.

Before that, Diane hinted that she wouldn't mind his company after work, not sexually, but as a supportive friend in a trying time. Her comment about going to bed with The Brothers Karamazov is a perfect metaphor. Her love of books cannot fill her need for friendship and intimacy. When Sam slides the mug of beer away and rejoices, Diane puts her hands over her heart and looks down prayerfully. She was completely with Sam in his crisis. Her great love for him was never more clear. Notice the studio audience's sustained applause when Sam won his battle. This episode is tremendous and for you Diane Chambers haters, watch this episode. You will never feel the same way about Diane again. Her facial tic reappearing at the end was another indicator of how much Diane was suffering along with Sam. She was truly there for him and gave the very best of herself in doing it.",1420761600,,2077,4.580645161290323

1856425,5,B00008NV4G,"Five stars for real classic comedy! I realize, some people don't like the harshness of some of the characters but after all, these characters do exist in real life. And the place like Cheers, is where your apt to find them. Characters have come and gone in that show. But, no one could ever replace Shelley Long as Diane Chambers. Period. Rebecca Howe, just didn't do it for me. For Rebecca's relationship with Sam was completely different than his relationship with Diane. Diane had the perfect intellect to counter the pagan beast. And even when Diane would insult Sam,he seemed to take it in stride because his testosterone wouldn't have it otherwise! Where as Rebecca Howe was dumb and smart in all the wrong areas. Anyway, the first episode of cheers is one of the best. Especially, when Diane rattles off the order given to Sam by Carla. When Sam says to Carla, ''Carla what am I making here''? And then Diane promptly rattles off'... ''Two Vodka Gimlets. 1 straight up,1 blended rocks. 1 Chivas rocks,soda,A comfort Manhattan,hold the cherry. A white wine spritzer,with a twist. One Old Bushmill,Irish Coffee,hold the sugar!'' And,at that instant,both She and Sam realize, that she,in fact, is perfectly cut out to be the waitress she didn't really want to be. And the saga continues from there... To a really fine comedic series that ran for 11 years...,1982-1993.  ''Sometimes,you wanna go,where everybody knows your name. Sometimes you wanna go,where every body's glad you came'' I'll have a cold beer,Sam!!!! Enjoy!",1404000000,,1526,4.984313725490196

Some shows are meant to be a blessing in that way and this is one of them.  The Sex reference goes on way to much and I got a bit board with that that is the only reason it didn't get all 5 stars but take it in small amounts and you will do great.,1403308800,,403,3.6511627906976742

The last that I watched, I think episode 13, didn't live up to the writing of most of the earlier ones.  Some are absolutely hilarious.  I've always felt that the ones with Diane far outshined the later ones with Rebecca after Diane left the show (possibly season 6 or 7 on).  With innumerable different directors and writers, there's bound to be a large variety in quality.  The same is true with the spin-off, ""Frasier""... the first couple of seasons were far superior.",1400544000,,566,4.6767676767676765

1856457,5,B00008NV4G,I started watching Cheers during the 3rd or 4th season when it originally aired.  Its fun to take a look back to how the characters started out and to watch them develop from that point onward.  This is one of the classic TV series....right up there with I Love Lucy.  What's not to love!  I suspect I will wind up watching all the seasons before I stop clicking on the next episode.,1397260800,,383,4.277777777777778

1856459,5,B00008NV4G,Season 1 of Cheers was so funny. We laughed out loud too many times to count.  The writers did an excellent job with so many human touches to keep us engaged in the stories. I can't rate this high enough. It is so well done!,1397088000,,224,3.977777777777778
1856460,5,B00008NV4G,"Season 1 of Cheers sets up the cast.  Sam ""Mayday"" Malone, a former relief pitcher for Boston, Ernie ""Coach"" Pantusso, Carla, the baby factory, Norm ""Norm!"", Cliff - ""I've got an explanation for everything"" and Diane, the token toity-toidy of the group.

Cheers, for the one person on this planet who may not have seen it before, is a bar in Boston.  It's a nice place, the kind of place you'd take your wife, girlfriend or even mother to have a drink after shopping.

Life revolves around the camaraderie and headbutting of the denizens.  Sam and Diane have a love/hate/lustful relationship.  Coach can't remember much as a result of taking ""too many to the head"" as a player.  Norm, an often out of work accountant, unhappily married to the often spoken of, never seen, Vera and Norm's barbuddy, Cliffy, the postman who believes his uniform is next to godliness and who has an explanation for everything.

Great acting and ensemble group who certainly appeared to have as much fun making the show as most viewers had watching it.  As a 25 minute episode, this is the perfect ""end of night"" viewing to lighten the mood and send one to bed with a laugh and chortle on their mind.",1397001600,2,1179,4.6298076923076925
1856461,5,B00008NV4G,Love watching this on amazon prime. The only time I can find it on tv is at 2 am. Now I can watch whenever I want. So glad there are no commercials!,1396915200,,148,3.65625
1856462,4,B00008NV4G,"Back in the days when Cheers was on TV in the 80s, I would have given this show 5 stars.  But today, in 2014, we are living in the golden era of TV shows.  Shows like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Sopranos, Arrested Development, Sons of Anarchy, and Game of Thrones have changed the landscape.  Shows are more authentic, more honest, more artful.  Cheers has little of that.  It has the basic premise of a dumb jock falling in love with a nerdy waitress.  And when Sam and Diane banter respectfully with each other, the show is at its absolute best.  Unfortunately, the sitcom writers of the 80s lacked imagination to take shows like this to the next level.  Their tank was small, and hence after a few seasons of clever and witty banter, the show devolves into one of humiliation.  Lacking the ability to keep the show fresh and edgy, the writers just default to embarrassing and humiliating the characters for cheap laughs.  No wonder Shelly Long (who plays Diane) eventually left the show.  What actress worth her salt would stay in such a sad pathetic role?  Luckily, the first season lacks much of that humiliation of Diane.  Oh there is 'some' of it... but for the most part Diane is a quirky, intelligent, quick witted, nerdy, open hearted woman who plays against Sam's shallowness very well.  Of course we find places where Diane is shallow, and learn where Sam is deep. It's a worthy story to tell, and with the wonderful cast and the Boston Red Sox Bar setting, it has atmosphere and charm all it's own.  Later seasons of the show have classic and funny moments, but less and less charm, and more and more humiliation.  Seeing these episodes again has been an interesting experience.  I see parts I really like, cringe at parts I used to like, but unfortunately almost never discover something new.  If you want a show you can watch over and over again, repeatedly discovering new jokes and layers, I turn your attention to Arrested Development.  But if you just want to spend some time with the gang at Cheers, I don't think you'll be disappointed with the first season here.",1395878400,,2079,4.615803814713897

That's because shows like these have humor that's timeless.  No matter the situation the characters of each show get mixed up in, most of us can not only easily identify with it, we most always learn something that helps us in our own life.  For whatever reason, it seems that Hollywood has lost it's ability over the years to produce more shows like these great classics.

1856630,5,B00008NV4G,This show is one of my all time favorites.  I didn't really catch on to Cheers when it first came out but got hooked to it when they were showing up as re-runs.  The chemistry between the characters Sam and Diane was a rare combination as the producers were able to keep the show fresh with each episode.,1361836800,,304,4.224137931034483
1856631,4,B00008NV4G,I used to watch this when it was on network television and I liked it but no big deal. Then when I got older and started to watch the re-runs on cable I started to pick up on the humor much more than I did years prior. The early shows really had some great lines and adult humor that you didn't appreciate unless you were old enough to relate to what was being said. Like all tv series it probably went for too many seasons and the writers had trouble finding good scripts to write and of course the characters changed which caused a loss of appeal from the original.,1361491200,,567,4.163636363636364
1856632,4,B00008NV4G,I spent years watching cheers in syndication as a young man. I pulled up Cheers on a whim one day and was enjoyed episode 1 so much that I have started plowing my way through the series. The show is over 30 years old but the performances and writing are still fresh and enjoyable. The only thing dated about the show is the wardrobe and the funny black box things that wring and people talk into.,1360713600,,396,4.223684210526316

Video, sound quality and packaging are fine.",1343174400,,462,4.310344827586207
1856643,5,B00008NV4G,"The first five seasons of Cheers were about as close to perfection as you can get. Unlike the hilarious Seinfeld, Cheers would occasionally toss in genuine moments of drama that contrasted sharply with the comedic atmosphere and worked brilliantly. This is because of the great cast and the superb writing. It is also because Shelley Long brought that ability to the show, something it simply did not have with Kirstie Alley. I liked Kirstie, too, but the relationship of Sam and Diane was far more engaging, compelling than Sam and Rebecca. By that time, Cheers had become a comfortable old shoe (thank you Dr. Crane) but still going for laughs and usually getting them.
But it was in the early seasons that we were able to see Cheers at its best, often times raw and unhindered by conventional tv sitcom mores. Instead of teasing the audience for years before bringing Sam and Diane together, they did it in the season ending episode, and it was just one in a long line of classic episodes. In many ways, the second season was the best, where we were able to see Sam and Diane fall in love and then, in a very powerful, atypical sitcom moment they broke up. Shelley Long and Ted Danson were particularly effective, especially in their scenes together, working off one another, in synch at a level I have rarely seen in American comedies.
The dvd sets are mostly bare bones, which is a shame. This is one of the great tv series that gets better with age and deserves the full treatment.",1338422400,,1487,4.615094339622641

1856646,5,B00008NV4G,"Like one of the Bar's patrons we would regularly find ourselves in this bar every thursday night. And we enjoyed every Minute of it. I first started watching when I was 10 when the show first aired. I was young, so there are some jokes I didn't get, but I was always good at figuring out the jokes/content based on context. I was proud of myself, as no one in my family seemed to know of the show, and it was insanely funny (even for a young child) and it wasn't until the would stop to see what I was watching did they realise that the show was great, and then they started watching it too. I have always loved this show,not only because it was a show I found on my own, but it was a show that was well-written and showed a wide variety of comedy styles. Since some of the production team and writers have evolved over the years with Shows like Mary Tyler Moore and Taxi, it should come as no surprise that this was another success story. I did not realise at the time that the show did poorly it's first season, as I couldn't imagine anyone not liking the show. The characters were well developed and each had their own little backstory. Usually in comedies the supporting characters are just props used for when the moment is right, to add a line here or to add ""atmosphere"" there. While you had two sensational main characters (Sam & Diane) you had this wonderful menagerie of supporting characters that weren't just there to recite a line or two, but to make the atmosphere of the bar feel like a bar, to feel like someplace you'd want to go. Sure the fact that it's a sitcom means that the events in the show will be exaggerated, but we all know people who have done some of the things these characters have done, and we laughed at them too. Some say this isn't how a real bar is, and I am not really a bar person, guess I've never found my ""cheers"" but comedies are supposed to take you away from your real life, and for 30 minutes make you laugh or cry, or just simply enjoy the time spent with your ""friends"". The characters are so richly developed that you feel they are real people. you almost feel as if you're sitting on a bar stool with them. If there really was a bar like this in the real world, I'd go, because it would make my life seem so much more simpler and less dramatic lol. But, you've got to love these characters. Sam the ex-relief pitcher for the Sox, who is a recoverring alchoholic who owns a bar (I've always been a big fan of irony)His skirt chasing would make him seem more like a jerk than anything, if it wasn't for the fatherly Coach who had been hit with too many pitches (and holds the record) but he was always sweet, and took care of Sam, so you got to see Sam's more human side. You start to realise that maybe there is a basic insecurity behind what he does with women, but he's the kind of guy you'd want in your corner, as you can see he'll take care of his friends. Then we had Diane, someone who shouldn't belong in a place like this, but somehow does. Shelly Long Played her to perfection. When it might seem that we should hate her for all of the stress she causes Sam and the gang,she'll do something that will make her seem as if she belongs in the bar just as much as everyone else. I am glad that they didn't try to replace her character when she left the show, instead they took the show and the female lead character in a totally different direction. Kirstie Alley was great as Rebecca, no one can navigate the uneven waters of her mood swings as masterfully as she does. It gives the character a more real-feel. She should be a success, and so should never be in a place like Cheers, but we learn that she has her insecurities and misgivings as well. We find that her extreme business-like demeanor was just a mask, and she was in fact a semi-loser looking for success in all the wrong places. As Norm once said ""the Hive now has a queen"". Woody also did not replace the Coach, whereas Coach was the father figure, Woody was the naive farm boy from questionable roots who has no idea of what to expect in the big city of Boston, but the gang takes him in and protects him, and tries to nurture him as best as they can. Which isn't very good, but they try. Carla is the spitfire, the one who says what we'd like to say but we know we shouldn't. Carla has a soft side though, and you'll find that she never really goes after Woody as much as she does everyone else, because she looks out for him. And there are a few times when we'd understand if she did do something to Woody but she doesn't. A hard on her lucky woman who sometimes causes her own problems but always keeps her head above water. As for Norm, How many times have we wished we had a one-liner at the ready when someone askes a mundane question such as ""What's up?"" (My Nipples, it's freezing out there) Never in the history of television has one character been giving so many delicious one-liners. (it's a dog eat dog world out there, and I'm wearing milkbone underwear) & then there is his partner in crime, Cliff. A lovable loser and an annoying know-it-all who really doesn't know much of anything. But, most people in the bar aren't smart enough to really call him out on it. Except Diane or Frasier. But Cliff and Norm were one of the greatest comedy pairings since the early days of Abbott and Costello and Laurel & hardy. Now Ratzenberger is Pixar's go to man for voice acting as well as their good luck charm. Plus there has been an amazing run of guest actors, who either showed up for just an episode or for an extended story arc. And everyone always seemed as if they were having a great time, on and off the set. Cheers was one of the first shows to have the opening quip as I like to call it. Where it would start the show with a joke, and then go to the theme song, and it's got to be the most remembered theme song of all times. And I'm not just saying that because I love the show. ""where everybody knows your name"" is now a part of our cultural lexicon. And cheers always loved to end the show with a laugh or sometimes a memorable moment. Sometimes it would end on a serious note, but most of the times you were still smiling by the time the closing credits rolled up. Anyone who is a fan of well written television, who loves characters that are real felsh and blood yet still deliciously over the top, will love this show. If you've never watched this show in your life, take the chance on the first season. but watch it about half way through the season before you form an opinion. This show more than mosts seems to reward the regulars, the more you watch it and pay attention to the intricacies of the character the more rewarding the humor will be. those who watched the show from beginning to end will know how great it really is. Casual watchers who tend to make assumptions rather than pay attention, are always going to be disappointed, Cheers can navigate between low brow/slap stick type humor and then in the next instance supply you with more intellectual based humor. The more you pay attention to the characters the more you listen to the words, you will start to notice that the show was intricately written not only to supply visual humor but also to get into your subconscious. These characters are addictive and the writing is always on the mark. The worst episode of Cheers (which isn't to say that they are bad) is better than most other sitcom's best episodes. You simply can't go wrong by purchasing this series. You'll probably shed a tear or two by the end of it's 11 Season run. But, you'll be smiling as well.",1318291200,2,7574,4.286113049546406
1856647,5,B00008NV4G,This show is just a re run of a show in the 80s. Its not a new show so be warned.,1313798400,,81,2.9047619047619047
1856648,3,B00008NV4G,"Let's face it, this show features some pretty pathetic characters, most of them not very likeable.  You have Sam, the washed-out reformed alcoholic bartender who chases everything with a skirt, Diane is certifiable, Rebecca is a loser, Cliff is a big know-it-all, Frazier is as pompous as a human being can be, Carla is a rude waitress.  If she had worked for me, I probably would have fired her on her first day.  And Norm?  Comatose.  Coach and Woody are sweet, likeable guys, but they're out to lunch most of the time.  And the situations that pop up there are more pathetic than funny.  Diane and Sam's (and later Rebecca's) romance is a joke.  For some reason, though, I find myself watching these shows at least once a year.  The stories are captivating, but, in the final analysis, not very good for chuckles.  Seems like every episode features at least one or even a few of these characters making fools of themselves.  If you can get past all that, it's entertaining.",1288224000,3,976,4.649122807017544

During the time I caught many re-runs and decided to get the entire first season to be able to watch it from start to finish and it was very worthwhile to be able to do so to see the show from the beginning.

A great ensemble cast and sharp writing made it a darling of critics despite the less than steller ratings and foruntately the show continued on so there were many more wonderful years of Sam, Cliff, Norm and Carla, plus some others that were not around for the full show but were very special in their own right,

If you liked the show at all, or have caught the first season in parts, it is really worthwhile to get this set and enjoy the beginnings of the bar where everyone knew your name.",1222905600,,938,4.081521739130435

From the opening episode when Diane first comes into Cheers and winds up with a job, to the final episodes when Sam finally deals with his life-long jealousy of his brother, the timing is consistently excellent and the cast shows a real chemistry.  The episode involving Sam's lucky bottlecap and how he licked his drinking problem will bring tears to your eyes.  The episode in which Sam hires a murderer to date Diane is also here and funny as ever.  These DVDs present the complete episodes, not the truncated versions now seen in syndication, so you will see footage, especially before the opening credits, that has not been seen on TV since the originals were presented.

1856659,5,B00008NV4G,"The series pilot is a dead giveaway that the creators knew they had a hit on their hands - a lot of times you'll see a small difference in quality between a pilot episode and the rest of the series, but in this case the first episode is, quality wise, at the same level as the other 21 episodes.

You can tell how long a show was on the air by the fuss they make when it eventually ends. And when Cheers ended, after 11 years, the fuss was huge.

The premise was fairly simple and pretty novel - take one bar in Boston, now, add some regulars, including Sam (lady's man and owner of the bar), Coach (the dim, but lovable barkeep), Carla (the one barmaid, who is equal parts feisty and fertile), Norm (Norm!) and Cliff (Mr. Zip's answer man). Gently add one dumped and down-on-her-luck brainiac (Diane) and stir. The result is a sitcom where the next story is whomever walks through the bar doors next. Brilliant!

While I love the humor and have come to appreciate the continuing saga of the bar regulars I like the style of Cheers the most. The majority of sitcoms involve some variation on the two-story, one family, suburban home, but Cheers took place in a bar. And that's it. Designed like a large stage play, the action never leaves the bar - people come and go, homes are mentioned, but RARILY does the camera leave the bar.

The four disc set comes with a nice helping of extras, but not a lot. The best is probably ""Setting the Bay: A Conversation with Ted Danson"", a four minute short wherein Ted Danson briefly goes over his role on Cheers and his thoughts about its charms, but honestly it was pretty short (8 minutes, most of which is clips from the show). In addition there are the following four clip collections;

""Love at First Sight: Opposites Distract""

""Coach Ernie Pantusso's Rules of the Game""

""I'll Drink to That: Stormin' Normisms""

""It's A Little Known Fact...""

Each features the best of the bits for each of the main characters, with the exception of Carla. The best would have to be the collection of Normisms - Norm's various responses to various greetings is a show standard and always good for a laugh, so compiling them all in one place is good for a hoot.

And finally, a Cheers trivia game, which tests to see if you've been paying close attention !

Now, if only I can get that theme out of my head...",1158537600,4,2337,4.424242424242424

Sam has two employees - bartender Ernie ""Coach"" Pantusso and waitress Carla Tortelli.

Regular barflies Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin round out a strong supporting cast.

1856664,1,B00008NV4G,"I was looking forward so much to enjoying the full first season of my favourite all-time sitcom only to be let down by the fact that in every episode the syncronisation is out. The actors lips are a beat ahead of the sound and it annoyed me so much I took it back and got a refund. As no-one else on this review thread has mentioned this I'm left wondering if I was just unlucky. It's not just this DVD where I've noticed the problem, it's also on my Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 1 disc although not quite as noticeable. Needless to say this explains my one star rating, otherwise it would be a definite five.",1106784000,6,608,4.25
1856665,4,B00008NV4G,"NBC's hit sitcom Cheers was seen Thursday evenings just like The Cosby Show. It premiered on September 30,1982,immediately bringing CBS's Archie Bunker's Place's ratings down. Eight days earlier,NBC launched Family Ties. At the time of Cheers' premiere,every cast member was either unknown or little known. Ted Danson is Sam Malone,the owner and operator of Cheers,a pub and short order restaurant who used to be a baseball player. This series was based on a real establishment in Boston. Shelley Long is Diane Chambers,an aspiring novelist who is Sam's on-and-off girlfriend(she would leave the series after the 1986-87 season). Rhea Perlman is Carla Tortelli,one of Cheers' waitresses who is acid-tongued and often bitchy. Perlman's real-life husband(was then and still is) Danny DeVito's sitcom Taxi moved from ABC to NBC when Cheers premiered. John Ratzenberger is Cliff Claven,a mailman who frequented the establishment. George Wendt is Norm Peterson who was also a frequent patron. Nicholas Colasanto is Nick ""Coach"" Pantusso who worked as a bartender(Colasanto died in '85 thus being replaced by Woody Harrelson). It is possible that Cheers won an Emmy for Best New Series in 1983. Like The Jeffersons,Married...With Children and Happy Days,this series would last 11 seasons! Throughout the series,Danson,Long,Perlman and Wendt would have film careers. As for Taxi,that series ended after the 1982-83 season as did Archie Bunker's Place.",1083715200,3,1444,5.568181818181818
1856666,5,B00008NV4G,"There are a few shows that are always, and will always, be included on every list there is naming the best shows that of all time on television. One that has always been there since it's time, and will continue to do so, is the brilliant piece of work that detailed the lives of people in the quaint Boston bar known as Cheers. It's rare for a television show to be as perfect as can be and gain all the right accolades, but this show was one of them. Premiering in 1982, and finishing the first season at number 72, out of 72 shows(!), the bar where everybody knows your name became a national treasure and introduced the world to a cast of characters that would become some of the most beloved people to appear on your screen. Ex Boston Red Sox player Sam Malone(Ted Danson), snooty barmaid Diane Chambers(Shelley Long), tough as nails barmaid Carla(Rhea Perlman), dim but loveable bartender Coach(Nicholas Colasanto), perennial barfly Norm(George Wendt), and know it all postman Cliff Clavin(John Ratzenberger). You knew right away that there was something special to this show. The premiere episode, ""Give Me A Ring Sometime"", introduced Diane to Cheers, and got the set up going. There were many great episodes, actually all of them, but too many to list all. ""The Coach's Daughter"" was a strong and emotional episode with Coach trying to help his daughter who is marrying an obnoxious leech of a man. ""One For The Book"" is a classic with Diane getting involved with a young man who plans to go into a monastery the next day. ""The Spy Who Came In For A Cold One"" is classic Cheers when a mysterious man comes into the bar and everyone wondering who he is. Classic Diane is shown in ""Let Me Count The Ways"", where she is devastated over the death of her beloved cat, Elizabeth Barret Browning, and the gang's cold shoulder towards her. ""The Boys In The Bar"" find the Cheers regulars worried that their favorite watering hole might become a gay hangout after a friend of Sam's reveals his homosexuality. Classic. ""Someone Single, Someone Blue"" is a big favorite of mine. Diane learns her mother will lose her late husband's fortune if Diane doesn't get married. So, her and Sam try what they can to save her mother from poverty. The two part season finale, ""Showdown Pt. 1"" and ""Showdown Pt. 2"" is Cheers at it's earliest best. The Sam/Diane triangle was exceptional, and it really got going in these two episodes, especially when Sam's more glorious older brother throws things into the mix. My favorite ep is ""Diane's Perfect Date"", where Sam sets Diane up on a blind date with a man who turns out to be a nurderer. There are so many more wonderful eps and moments here, but there are just too many to mention. Just one of the great things about this masterful show. A lot of good stuff!. The writing was so strong, funny, and intelligent. Writing that is almost extinct in sitcom world nowadays. The acting was superb, and everyone had their own distinction to their character. It was, and still is, as well as with cast changes down the road, one of the most exemplary depictions of a pitch perfect cast. Season one is a treasure. Bring on seasons 2 -11!!.",1080691200,,3163,4.619893428063943
1856667,4,B00008NV4G,"Have you had a hard day? Well, let Sam, Diane and the gang take your mind of your troubles. Shelly Long absolutely nails the part of Diane Chambers, a ""pseudo-intellectual"" university student who finds herself in the employ of Sam ""Mayday"" Mallone, an ex-pitcher, ex-drunk, who managed, through his alcoholic haze, to hang onto his business, a quaint Boston bar full of colourful characters. Rounding out the cast is Carla, the abrasive and fertile waitress, Coach, the dim-witted, but lovable bartender, Norm, the beer guzzling, extremely regular customer, and Cliff, another regular whose skill at mixing real historical facts with wive's tales and other fiction is legendary. The first season of 22 episodes is spent exploring what a bad idea it would be if the mismatched Sam and Diane got together, but it seems inevitable that they eventually will.
When this show aired in the early eighties, it was a breath of fresh air, especially the Diane and Carla characters, as diametrically opposed as they may be. The team of Shelly Long and Ted Danson created explosive chemistry on the small screen, and people tuned in each week to see them in action. Cliff provided outrageous and long-winded stories. Norm contributed with his signature entrances and one-liners. Carla added even more chemistry to the mix with her most verbal dislike of Diane, serving up a constant supply of barbs along with her drinks.
The extras are limited to a few interviews and montages, but the shows themselves look very decent. I think the series would have been very well served with audio commentary on at least the key episodes, much in the style of the Friends DVD's. However, that's probably not a realistic expectation for an old show where none of the producers or cast has anything invested in the sale of DVD's. Still, one of the great sitcoms of our time and you can own it!",1078617600,2,1866,4.889589905362776
1856668,4,B00008NV4G,"Best:
1) You get to relive classic moments from this very memorable comedy with favorite characters Sam, Diane, Carla, Coach, Cliff and NORM!
2) When others shows make you think too much or fail to make you laugh, this series is simply comfortable to slip into anytime.
3) The subtle jokes are the best. Watch (or listen) for them while the main actions are going on.
Worst:
1) Aside form an interesting Ted Danson interview, the special features are limited to scene montages of stuff you've already seen.
Recommendation:
You can't help but find this series endearing, if not outright hilarious, but you might be disappointed with the lack of good special features. Regardless, it's a must-have for any serious comedy collection.",1077840000,,730,4.991803278688525

1856670,5,B00008NV4G,"The television show 'Cheers' meant so much to so many people. For me, I could relate to many characters. I went through my ""Diane' and my 'Rebecca'. The appeal of this show was not just the comedy, but the writing. Cheers was a soap opera disguised as a SitCom. We cared about the people on the show. I still remember when Coach died. I thought it was the end of the show. Thankfully that wasn't the case. He was replaced, but never forgotten (Geronimo). We all cared about Sam and Diane, we wanted them to be happy. In the end though, the very last episode, I still don't know if they were or not.
But you can see the crazy, first season that made it all happen. Possibly the most touching episode is 'Coach's Daughter'. She finally understands what his idea of beauty is. That was great acting, and great writing. It doesn't get better than Cheers.",1073520000,9,850,4.420382165605096

1856672,5,B00008NV4G,"Unlike most of the reviewers on this site, I was not a very big Cheers fan and started watching the series just so that I could understand what my friends were talking.  When I finally did start watching Cheers, it was probably into its latter seasons with the introduction of Kirstie Alley as Rebecca.  I must admit, I thoroughly enjoyed the show and not surprisingly I find the laughs comparable to present shows likes Friends.  But during this time, through references in the show, I was always curious about the earlier seasons, particularly numerous references to ""Diane"" and such.
  It was with rather guarded expectations that I picked up this first season as I really don't expect much from them.  Usually the characters are yet undefined and I thought the storylines were written with ""we may not be returning next season"" in the background.  The first seasons of Simpsons, Friends, even Star Trek TNG, for me, emphasized this point.
Fortunately, I was very very wrong.
  The first season of Cheers was quite the surprise by offering a totally different type of experience that from the sitcoms that I had been used.  While I view modern sitcoms as pure comedies (enjoyable, but far from moving), the first seasons of Cheers had a great balance of comedy and romance.  While the latter seasons with Cheers was a great laugh, I don't think I ever pulled for any one character and simply enjoyed the stories for what they were worth.  However, with the first season, I thought the Diane and Sam story line was done brilliantly and I actually found myself genuinely hoping that the two characters would get together.
  The Diane and Sam story line seemed much more enjoyable... pleasant than latter stories between Sam and Rebecca.  In my view, Sam and Rebecca was pure laughs and while I certainly did laugh at their various exploits, now that I have watched the first season, I definitely don't think it has the same sentimental value as the Sam and Diane storyline.
  While I don't think there are too many people such as myself who jumped on the bandwagon late.  But for those people, and I guess anyone, I would definitely recommend this DVD.  It has certainly showed me that Cheers did not develop into one of the greatest sitcoms of our time, but it started out that way.",1062201600,8,2284,4.736708860759494

1856675,5,B00008NV4G,"""Cheers"" is an atypical classic television situation comedy in that its first season (1982-83) is arguably its best.  The show won the Emmys for Outstanding Comedy Series, Lead Actress in a Comedy Series: Shelley Long, Directing in a Comedy Series: James Burrows, ""Showdown (Part 2),"" Writing in a Comedy Series: Glen Charles, Les Charles, ""Give Me a Ring Sometime,"" and even Outstanding Individual Achievement/Graphic Design and Title Sequences: James Castle, Bruce Bryant.  This would explain why the series, which finished 75th in the Nielsens with a 13.1 rating, survived on NBC's Thursday night lineup.
Looking back on the series as a whole it becomes clear that one inherent advantage for ""Cheers"" was that no matter what joke the writers came up with there was the perfect character to tell it.  If you had a sarcastic barb then that went to Carla (Rhea Perlman), a dumb comment would come out of the mouth of Coach (Nick Colasanto), the arcane bar trivia belonged to Cliff (John Ratzenberger), the caustic non-sequiters and marriage humor was the province of Norm (George Wendt), the intellectual bon mots went to Diane (Shelley Long), and Sam (Ted Danson) played the Lord of the Come Ons.  Equally as important, the bar where everybody knows your name was an appropriate place for all of these types of humor.  As Diane says in the first episode: ""Where better than here to study life in all its facets?  People meet in bars, they part, they rejoice, they suffer, they come here to be with their own kind.""
But the most important thing was that ""Cheers"" made the opposite attract concept work.  Televison has a hard time handling romantic comedy.  Making it work, like on ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" is the exception; the rule is Dave and Maddie imploding on ""Moonlighting.""  But Cheers managed to make the story of Sam and Diane with its on again, off again, really off, back on, never going to happen, then again who knows for several seasons.  On the eve of her elopement Diane Chambers comes to Cheers and while sitting on a barstool sees her entire life crumble before her eyes.  By the end of the night she is a barmaid and although Diane and Sam have nothing in common, they are doomed.  At the end of the season when Sam's brother shows up to sweep Diane off her feet with an invitation to Paris, we know that Sam will finally confess his feelings (""Showdown, Part 2""), although Diane has to threaten to run her fingernails on the chalkboard to get him to stay.  Then comes one of the great final clinches of all time.
I always say that I liked ""Cheers"" before Sam left the show, which confuses people since it was Shelley Long's Diane who left the show (but managed to return a few times).  But my point is that the Sam of these early years, and the first season in particular, was a much different character from the show's second half.  There was a pathos to Sam, which disappeared when the mental image of him dancing with Diane when they were old and grey from her final episode faded away.  Sam the womanizer was a joke during those final seasons: but in this first year you can see how charming he can be: the point is amply proven when Sam tells Diane where he remembers seeing the same color as he sees in her eyes.  There is also an edge to Sam as an ex-baseball player (""Sam at Eleven"" and ""Endless Slump"") that disappears later on as it becomes one giant joke.
When you watch the complete first season again on DVD you will see that there is a serious side to ""Cheers.""  Watch Coach's daughter (Allyce Beasley) try to explain to her father that she is not beautiful in ""The Coach's Daughter"" without crying.  Of course that was the episode they showed to honor Nick Colasanto when he passed away.  But there is also the choice episodes that feature quick appearances (""Sam at Eleven"") and complete episodes (""Pick a Con...Any Con"") focusing on Harry the Hat (Harry Anderson).  Another thing that helps take the pressure off the Sam-Diane potential romance is the bumbling antagonism between Diane and Carla.  This is a constant note that can pop up at any time during an episode, but sometimes Carla goes out of her way to play with Diane's mind (""Truth or Consequences,"" ""Father Knows Last"").
This is my favorite season of ""Cheers"" and I am willing to take on any and all comers who want to offer rebuttal to my claim that this is the greatest first season for any situation comedy in television history.  ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Honeymooners,"" ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" ""All in the Family,"" ""M*A*S*H,"" ""Seinfeld,"" ""Friends,"" all got a lot better after their inaugural season.  None of them started as great as ""Cheers"" did, and if you want to discuss this over a drink I will have a cola with a couple of cherries in it, please.",1056240000,84,4803,4.636792452830188

The extras were a bit skimpy...the ""Normisms"" and ""Coach's Rules of the Game"" were all lines from the first season only, so it's way too short. The interview with Ted Danson was only about 5-10 minutes long. In any case, you're really buying this set for the shows, not the extras. Hopefully on a later season's set, they'll include the 10th anniversary special.",1054598400,,521,4.673913043478261

All the memorable characters from all 22 of the first season's memorable episodes are here, including ""Give Me a Ring Sometime,"" the series' pilot. The bonus material is OK, nothing great ---  an acceptable interview with Ted Danson, a trivia game that's way too easy, though the featurette on ""Stormin' Norm-isms"" is as cute as Diane ever was ... or will be. Take a break from all your worries and get away to a place where everyone knows your name.",1053993600,4,627,4.452173913043478
1856681,5,B00008NV4G,"It has been a long wait for those of us addicted to Cheers. But patience is rewarded.
The clarity of the images makes it seem like one is watching each episode for the first time. It is easy to forget how REALLY good the first year was (and still is). The shows are very intelligent, noticeably more so than later years, and witty. It is fun to observe the inconsistencies in the characters -- in one episode Norm is clearly not married and Sam brings his ""ex-wife"" into the bar. But at the same time the characters, without the more clearly defined ""roles"" of later years, are often more interesting, most especially Carla.
I met Rhea Perlman and she was understandably not all that proud of the rather 2 dimensional Carla of the later years. Here the character is wise-cracking, but with more depth and Perlman's considerable talents have room to shine. Also, Coach is a a great character, expertly realised, and more. One episode has the scene with Coach and his daughter Lisa, who is ""not comfortable with her beauty,"" that is arguably the most moving, and genuinely so, scene ever in a TV series. And the sexual tension between Sam and Diane is about as good as it gets. I marvel that this season's shows were the lowest rated program on TV -- it is simply great comedy, suberbly written, and well performed by a strong cast that is consistently ""on."" How extremely fortunate that NBC stuck with the show!
Technically, as mentioned above, it is amazing to see the familiar images in such detail and clarity. The sound quality too is much improved over broadcasts of the time and most of the reruns. And, of course, each episode is complete -- unlike the broadcast reruns which frequently cut lines, and occasionally scenes.
One quibble. The shows are not in their original broadcast order, which makes the inconsistencies in character development even more baffling. But it is a quibble.
Overall, magnificent. Highly recommended.
So now, when do we get season 2?",1053648000,15,1967,4.737609329446064

What I will do is say this....in a nutshell, there is absolutely NO REASON for you NOT to buy this DVD. If you are a fan of Cheers, the first minute of watching Episode One, you will be watching with your mouth opened...literally...like I did. From the beautiful stereo sound of the theme music, to the vibrant colors of the remastered film (especially if you have a component set-up), you will be filled with ""wow"" and ""oh my gosh"" as you step back in time. This DVD package is a MUST BUY for any fan of Cheers. Just be warned about one thing, the episodes are not in the order in which they were aired for some strange reason.  Other then that, step back to a time when TV was at its absolute perfection...and step into a place where everybody knows your name. Enjoy!!",1053561600,7,921,4.323699421965318

i just watched the first 3 episodes, and still think it is the best show ever.
i still hate dianne, but other than that, it still makes me laugh so hard i can't see; but now i can pause it or watch it again.  and again.
WHY DIDN'T THEY RELEASE ALL OF THE SEASONS!?  dangit.
the theme could easily plague your sleep since it isn't cut out, so you hear it every episode.  i'll be humming the cheers theme forever.  other than that (and dianne), this is heaven.
ya gotta love cheers!",1053475200,2,678,4.307086614173229
1856684,5,B00008NV4G,"When Cheers premiered on NBC on September 30, 1982 it got off to very auspicious start. The show was the lowest rated program for the week. From those humble beginnings, it would eventually last eleven seasons, become the highest rated program for the 1990-91 season, win an amazing twenty-eight Emmy Awards including four as Outstanding Comedy Series and become one of the most popular and beloved television shows in history. The show revolved around a bar, Cheers, owned by former Boston Red Sox reliever, Sam ""Mayday"" Malone played by Ted Danson and Sam's co-workers and regular patrons. Sam is a ladies man/playboy who is superficial and vain. He is also a recovering alcoholic who is kept on the straight and narrow by his mentor and fellow bartender, Ernie ""Coach"" Pantusso, played by the late Nicholas Colasanto. Coach is a kind-hearted dimwit who was also a former major leaguer (early on it is mentioned he played for the St. Louis Browns who were the doormats of the American League for years) and dispenses odd, but caring advice to Sam and the other patrons. Very little activity took place outside the confines of the bar. The first episode finds Diane Chambers, played by Shelly Long, coming into Cheers to wait for her fianc&eacute;e while he picks up the engagement ring from his ex-wife. The fianc&eacute;e never shows up and Diane accepts a job from Sam to be a waitress. Diane is a stuffy, uptight, highbrow who feels she is morally and intellectually superior to everyone at the bar and isn't afraid to let everyone know it. She becomes the immediate target of Cheers' other waitress, Carla Tortelli, played by Rhea Perlman. Carla is the exact opposite of Diane, streetwise and incredibly acerbic. George Wendt is Norm Peterson, the barfly who has a long running tab and a seat at the corner of the bar. He is an accountant who is miserable at his job and with his wife, the never to be seen, but often mentioned Vera. John Ratzenberger's Cliff Clavin was only a recurring character for the first season (his character was listed in the closing credits, not the opening credits as it would be from season two until the end of the series), but his persona as the master of trivial information and devoted postman and son is established. The first season would focus on the budding relationship of Sam & Diane. There was a constant tension between the two and it is the will they or won't they get together relationship that was the show's dominant plot. Outstanding episodes include ""Coach's Daughter"" where Coach's daughter brings her fiancee to meet him and he turns out to be a real jerk, ""Coach Returns To Action"" where both Coach & Sam vie for the affections of Coach's new neighbor (the episode ends with a hilarious pratfall by Coach down a flight of stairs), ""Now Pitching, Sam Malone"", where Sam becomes a TV pitchman and one of the show's all-time best episodes ""Diane's Perfect Date"" where Sam & Diane bet they can find the perfect date for another and Sam forgets to pick someone for Diane and must scour the bar for a last minute date and finds a guy Andy (Derek McGrath) in the pool room who turns out to be a motorcycle driving ex-con. The show featured numerous guest stars including Harry Anderson who appear in several episodes as con man Harry ""The Hat"" Gittes and helped pave the way for him to star in another NBC hit comedy Night Court. Other first season guest stars include Julia Duffy as on old friend of Diane's who Sam hits on, Christopher McDonald as a Red Sox pitcher who Sam loans his lucky bottle cap to in order break out of a slump, Fred Dryer as a local newsman, famous DJ Rick Dees, former Red Sox great Luis Tiant as himself and Boston political legend and former Speaker of The House, Tip O'Neil also portraying himself. Keenan Ivory Wayans has a brief bit in one episode playing a customer. An interesting bit of trivia, Paul Willson who would appear throughout the series run (and become a semi-regular) as bar patron Paul, appears in the first season but is referred to as Glen. Although its ratings were low, Cheers was a major success with the critics, many of which hailed as the best show on television. They were justified when Cheers won five Emmys at 1982-83 awards including its first win as Outstanding Comedy Series, Ms. Long won for Outstanding Lead Actress in a comedy series and show also won for best direction and writing.",1053388800,2,4397,4.696891191709844
1856685,5,B00008NV4G,"This is the finest first season of ANY sitcom. I would strongly disagree with the customers who think that the show hit its stride in the second season. ""Cheers"" hit its stride when Diane said ""You gather my inference"" to an obnoxious customer in episode 3. It flew into the stratosphere in the two-part finale which featured some of the sharpest acting and writing in film or tv. Don't let those reviewers fool you. ""Cheers"" was in full bloom from nearly the very beginning. I am excited about the DVD release. Now how about ""The Duck Factory"" with Jim Carrey.",1051142400,4,561,4.62
1856686,5,B00008NV4G,"Before Woody, Rebecca, or even Frasier joined the gang, there was just Sam, Diane, Carla, Cliff, Coach, and of course NORM! Or as Diane would say Norman. Cheers is one of my faovrite shows ever, and with good cause. Although the show really starts to bloom in the second season, the first is still worth getting. The show starts off with a 35 year old ex baseball player for the boston Red Sox, sam, running a bar, along with his ex-baseball coach, and his bossy, always pregant waitress Carla. After only a few moments we met, inspiring writer/poet, bride-to-be Diane Chambers. When her boyfriend leaves her, she takes a job at Sam's bar, called Cheers. Norm is the same as he is in every season, a beer drinking, in-and-out-of-work, costumer. And hears a little known fact (Cheers fans should recognize those words), Cliff's character is only a supporting character, and has less scenes, than in any other scenes.
Although the 3rd season and up are really my favorites, the first season offers us some of the smartest comedy writting ever. At only 37 dollars, and the free shipping option, if you order from amazon, this is a must have.
Here are some things for Cheers fans to watch for.
1. Coach - this character was replaced by Woody after the actor, Nicholas Colasanto died. Although I love Woody, and think the Coach and Woody are very similar. There is a certain charm found in Coach, that makes him a truely memorable character.
2. Is that Paul? - For fans of  the later seasons of Cheers, you may remember a character named Paul. He was never a main character, but he was a often returning character. Although Paul is not in these episodes, the actor, plays random characters throughout the seasons, including this one. So for those who remember him, he is in at least one episode of this season.
3. He loves her, he loves her not - Sam and Diane's story line is done perfectly. Although they don't get together until the end of this season, their comments, and arguments about each other, are not to be missed.

7985840,5,B00008NV4G,"The first season of ""Cheers"" is finally released on four DVDs with 22 episodes and extra features. The setting is fictional Cheers in Boston, Massachusetts in 1982. Shelley Long's Diane Chambers and her snooty fianc were planning to get married but she ends up alone at the bar where everyone knows your name. Ted Danson's Sam Malone, a former Boston Red Sox player and bar owner, offers her a job. Sam and Diane were as different as night and day so there was obvious chemistry from the first moment onscreen.

The other characters in the bar include fellow barmaid Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) with her outspoken and obvious hostility towards Diane. Carla is a rough street smart divorced mother of four children. Coach Ernest Pancusso was played by the late Nicholas Colasanto where Ted Danson recalls him as the heart and soul of the series. Sadly, Coach died during the series run but he wasn't forgotten. He was an irreplaceable cast member. Barflies include George Wendt's Norm Peterson, the lovable accountant, and John Ratzenberger's Cliff Clavin, the mailman with all the answers. This show was an ensemble based series from the very beginning with well-developed characters.

Guest stars were abundant during the first season like Glynis Johns playing Diane's mother; Ellis Rabb in the Christmas episode; Barbara Babcock; Derek McGrath; Speaker Tip O'Neill in a cameo; Gretchen Corbett; Julia Duffy; Reid Shelton; Harry Anderson and more. The series wasn't expected to last long based on Nielsen ratings but NBC's Brandon Tartikoff knew a hit series at the time. Cheers would be well-awarded with Emmys and Golden Globes. It was a smart series and thankfully Tartikoff gave it the time to blossom and succeed for eleven seasons with the successful spinoff series, ""Frasier.""",1491696000,,1786,5.113013698630137
