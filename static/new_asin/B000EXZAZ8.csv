8115712,5,B000EXZAZ8,"I'd never played guitar before.  The program promised that I'd learn to play guitar well enough to be comfortable playing in a small group or small church setting once I finished it.  They delivered on their promise.  I love playing the guitar now, and I cannot recommend this method strongly enough.  Andy assumes NOTHING, so he teaches EVERYTHING.  If you pick up your guitar and get started, you will be playing in no time.  Just DO it!",1449792000,2,439,4.636363636363637
8115713,5,B000EXZAZ8,This series of worship guitar tutorials is great for someone who is just beginning and wants to take things at their own pace. I encourage you to buy this and watch yourself grow musically.,1364860800,,189,4.588235294117647
8115714,5,B000EXZAZ8,"I originally purchased the product for our homeschool.  My oldest daughter wanted to learn guitar and I wanted her to learn from a worship music perspective.  That was about 10 purchases ago.  We have since bought 3 more guitar courses  and 3 keyboard courses and 2 bass courses.  My kids all play multiple instruments now and can play together as a band and with other folks.  I can't express how easy it has been to get them to learn how to play using these DVD's!

Our purchase history:

Worship Band practice DVD

Multitrack Player and about 20 songs plus super chord charts

If you want to learn worship music or you want your kids to learn, this is the way to do it.  Just sit down and make the time and do the lessons.  Musicademy has so many products that work together to make a complete package and everything is so reasonably priced.  We are with the US Military in Italy and hope to visit the Musicademy Studios in England this summer for some private lessons!

Last note....if you are playing acoustic guitar and have not been to your guitar shop to have your guitar 'set up' you need to run and not walk and pay the $40 to have it done.  It will make any guitar (except the most expensive) soooo much easier to play.

8115715,5,B000EXZAZ8,"Just what I was looking for.  After several years of not touching a guitar, I was looking for a course that would review the basics while help learn new songs and strum patterns...this was perfect.",1314748800,2,197,4.628571428571429
8115716,5,B000EXZAZ8,"I bought the series Musicademy Beginner's Worship Keyboard course. I was so impressed with it that I bought the intermediate and advanced DVDs as well.  So when I wanted to learn to play guitar, I did not hesitate to buy the Beginner's Worship Guitar Course box set.  Again, I am very very pleased with my purchase and the high quality of the material.  Andy Chamberlain is a great teacher and the pace is just right.  Plus there are backing tracks and drum loops so you can practice what you learned and the loops help you stay on the beat.  I just bought the intermediate DVDs even though I am still going through the beginner's set.  I was taking guitar lessons but was not making much progress until I got the DVD.  I was so impressed how quickly I was progressing and how much I was enjoying it.  I think the DVD is simply more convenient and I can get my lessons when I feel like it.  The website is full of information [...].  They are first class videos and their customer service is outstanding.
