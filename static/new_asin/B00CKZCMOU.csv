8582857,5,B00CKZCMOU,Love this DVD.  Several of my friends will be getting together for our own Mask Making Ceremony.  This DVD is very great in explaining not only everything that we need but also shows and explains every step we need to take.  Also great are the many suggestions for going even further in making other sorts of masks and decorating them.  So very thankful for Ronda and her input and HER!!,1424563200,,387,4.485714285714286
