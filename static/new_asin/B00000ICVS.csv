7910422,2,B00000ICVS,"In the first episode we meet a seeker of the Grail, a man who believes to be cursed and a creature that hides in a Vorlon suit. The attempt to introduce the Grail lore to the series is not a successful one, but the episode has a few good moments, most of them around a hideous mind absorbing creature.
""Eyes"" was a complete disappointment. Sinclair is facing court martial, but the plot is much too thin.",980985600,,404,4.328947368421052
