2131988,4,B0002WZTCA,"Star Trek: Voyager's fifth season was the beginning of the end for good story telling on Voyager. Although the seasons following Season Five still have many good stand-out episodes, this is the final season that told extremely well stories with one good episode after another, flowing into the next.

There are many great episodes that stand out in this season, far more than the poor performing sixth season to follow. This is my second-favorite Voyager season, right after Season Four.

Although this season originally didn't have any 2-part episodes, it did air a 2-hour movie called ""Dark Frontier"" which has now been separated into separate 2-part episodes.

Species 8472 returns for the last time in ""In the Flesh"" and finally opens communication with Voyager.

Naomi Wildman, who was born in the Second Season of Voyager, gets a new talented young actress, Scarlett Pomer, in ""Once Upon a Time"" which made way for the character to have numerous appearances from now until the end of the show's run.

Tom Paris gets demoted to Ensign in ""Thirty Days"" after betraying Janeway's orders. But don't worry, he gets his rank back in Season Six.

The episode ""Bride of Chaotica"" is a nice change of pace and has some funny scenes.

Season Five also aired the 100th episode, this allowed the show to go into syndication, which helped bring in more people to watch the show.

Unlike Season Four, this season has an explosive season finale cliffhanger called ""Equinox"".

WORST OF SEASON FIVE: ""Nothing Human"", ""Counterpoint"", ""The Disease"", ""The Fight"", and ""11:59"".",1096934400,27,1562,5.023255813953488
2131989,4,B0002WZTCA,"Less than one year following the concluding season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the ""Star Trek"" universe originally created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled ""Voyager"" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May 2001. Because ""Voyager"" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season. The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.

Unlike the previous three ""Star Trek"" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy. Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth. Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.

The primary cast members of the fourth season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Lt. Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ), Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and the former Borg drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Voyager's fifth season begins with the episode ""Night"", in which Voyager has been traveling through a void that may take them 2 years to traverse and the crew is slowly going crazy. The ship is attacked by three alien ships built by natives of the seeming void; but when Voyager is assisted by another alien ship that is dumping deadly radioactive waste into the void, Voyager's crew realizes what is happening to the void's natives.

During the fifth season of ""Voyager"", Seven of Nine becomes an accidental mother to an advanced drone named One (J. Paul Boehmer) in episode ""Drone"", B'Elanna continues her ongoing struggles with her Klingon half, Kim from the future attempts to save Voyager from total destruction in episode ""Timeless"", Paris is punished for trying to save a watery world in episode ""Thirty Days"", the holographic doctor is plagued by a difficult decision in episode ""Latent Image"" and Capt. Janeway battles the Borg Queen (Susanna Thompson) in the two-part episode ""Dark Frontier"". The best fifth-season episodes, in order of airdate, include ""Night"", ""Drone"" (one of the best ""Voyager"" episodes ever), ""Extreme Risk"", ""In the Flesh"" (the return of species 8472), ""Timeless"", ""Thirty Days"", ""Counterpoint"", ""Latent Image"", ""Bride of Chaotica!"" (aliens visit Paris' holodeck program), ""Gravity"", ""Bliss"", ""Dark Frontier (Parts 1 and 2)"",  ""Juggernaut"", ""11:59"", ""Relativity"", ""Warhead"" and the season finale ""Equinox, Part 1"".  The least memorable fifth-season episodes include ""Once Upon a Time"", ""The Disease"" and ""The Fight"".

Overall, I rate the fifth season of ""Voyager"" with 4 out of 5 stars since it was a slightly weaker season than its predecessors, but did have some very good episodes.",1093737600,38,3967,5.288888888888889
2131990,4,B0002WZTCA,"After a good run of episodes in season four,which was sparked by the debut of Seven of Nine,the following season found the show back on autopilot ala' early season two.
For great episodes like Timeless(the 100th episode),Drone,Bride of Chaotica ,Nothing Human and the two part Dark Frontier,there are weak episodes (The Fight,Once upon a Time,11:59, 30 Days, and The Disease).
 The season finale cliffhanger Equinox brings much promise for the Sixth Season. Which was somewhat an improvement on the mediocre fifth.",1093564800,7,514,5.345679012345679

2132004,4,B0002WZTCA,My wife and I love the series but the one episode that really pissed us off was Course: Oblivion.

2132008,4,B0002WZTCA,"I like the new packaging vs the old. The old one is awkward, flimsy, and more likely to get broken. I don't like how all the episodes in the entire series are not in sequence to their numbered episode. I'm not sure why they did this, unless they were doing it by air dates. Some of the stories are weak, but unlike deep space 9, they don't constantly focus on stories under a constant war theme. Deep space 9 was my favorite of the series, because I had only really seen the first season, which is also my favorite, but this constant doom and gloom is consistent with daily life and I use TV to try to distract myself from the misery that this world is obsessed with. I might as well just watch the news or one of the many daily soaps. Notice how in them, that the women mostly wear black outfits and dark eye make-up? Looks like they are all going to a funeral.

2132021,5,B0002WZTCA,"The greatest share of the best episodes in the series appear in Season 5. This season moves away from encounters with alien civilizations and toward smaller scale personal encounters. Some of the best episodes barely leave the ship. Rest assured, big ideas are explored, but in a smaller and more personal way.

The Best Episodes of Season 5

Episode 2  Drone - The human side of Seven gets developed in a story arc that begins here, where she and the Doctor are inadvertently involved in the creation of a new life. Seven experiences a type of motherhood in the course of an accelerated process of maturation for a highly evolved hybrid being. You will adapt is the key line and lesson.

Episode 5  Once Upon a Time  The fifth of my Voyager Top Ten. This episode introduces Scarlett Pomers as the adorable Naomi Wildman, the first child born on Voyager. And wow can she act. Originally cast for a single episode, Pomers was so good she was written into an additional six episodes. Her lines and scenes drive the best parts of the plot. Also, the holodeck is used for telling childrens stories and teaching lessons in an imaginative way. Subtle bits of dialog within the holo-program experience hint at remarkably clever features.

Episode 8  Nothing Human  An intense plot that plays out the question: do the ends justify the means? Medical techniques necessary to save lives were obtained only through brutal experiments on unwilling subjects. Decades later, does it matter? Who has the right to weigh in on the question? A very thoughtful and thorough treatment of the idea.

Episode 12  Bride of Chaotica -  The sixth of my Voyager Top Ten. A beautiful homage to early science fiction television programming. You can tell a lot of effort went into producing this episode. There are so many fun little things that its hard to know where to start. The plot really doesnt matter. Its all about the early sci-fi features. The black and white presentation, overdramatic acting, sinister music, archaic dialog, feeble special effects, rudimentary ops panels, the list is endless.

Episode 22  Someone to Watch Over Me - The seventh of my Voyager Top Ten. There are a lot of love stories in this series that really don't ring true (Neelix/Tess, Tom/Tess, Tom/BElanna, and Chakotay/every female character) but this one does. Its not a traditional love story, but why would it be? This is Voyager. There is an amusing premise here (which you have adopted yourself if you have watched this far into the series) that the Doctor is more dimensional than Seven as a person. A photonic image has something to offer about us what it means to be human.

Worst of Season 5

Episode 6  Timeless
An odd choice to pair Chakotay and Harry when other combinations (BElanna and Chakotay, Harry and Tom) would have made more sense. No explanation of the terms of the temporal prime directive or how Starfleet has organized a police force for enforcing it. (Time cop is a sad fate for Jordi LaForge.) If you know your friends died, what satisfaction is there is saving a different timeline from the same fate? And why would you expect other timelines to repeat the history of your own timeline?

Episode 18  Course Oblivion
I just don't understand the point to this episode. The story itself drives off your interest in the characters. The plot advances like air being let out of a balloon, including the pffft climax. Pointlessness is not an interesting story idea.

Episode 25  Warhead
Best example of Roger Eberts idiot plot defect. An idiot plot is any plot containing problems that would be solved instantly if all of the characters were not idiots. Sure, lets keep a dangerous bomb that we don't understand and is already broken in sick bay while we poke around. What could go wrong?",1487808000,4,3768,4.783950617283951

2132221,4,B0002WZTCA,"I've been binge watching through all seasons of Star Trek Voyager for a  few months. In general, I like STVOY. But it seems like season 5 is nothing new. Each episode is a new crisis and if it is a one parter, the episode ends with Janeway saying ""set a course for the alpha quadrant"". The same themes and arcs just reoccur over and over.  The contrast between Neelix and Tuvok, the relationship between B'alana and Tom, the sexual tension between Janeway and Chakotay, the friendahip between Naomi and Seven. Etc... Each episode has a formula, either they are running out of something and need to find it or they come across a new planet or species and have to explore. And I wish I had a buck for every time they have run across someone in need, stop and help only to get screwed! Even though Chakotay or Tuvok warns the captain it may be a trap. Ha. But even for all that, I'm hooked. I like the series and I'm going to watch it through to see what happens in the final season.",1474848000,4,980,4.291891891891892

2132418,5,B0002WZTCA,"I repeat the review I gave before for Star Trek Voyager from season 1 to the end of season 7. for the most part the story line was good, but the acting was great right from the very beginning. Often it takes a few episodes of any series on TV for us to get to know the characters. The story line of Star Trek Voyager never deviated from their original character portrayal which made the series very enjoyable to watch.",1461801600,,418,4.2375

2132424,5,B0002WZTCA,"I think there are three bum episodes in the entire season. It's that good.

The first episode Night was a sweet little change up. Timeless we get to see a synical old man of Harry, a great little change for him. Counterpoint, Who doesn't love it. Course: Oblivion I love cause it follows up on a earlier episode.

Equinox was a little of a stretch for me but did explore that what if for the Voyager crew.

A dud or two more overall but I think still a great season.",1461024000,,466,4.155555555555556

I wish there were a full length movie the producers could have made, however in the series they did have multiple over one hour episodes. Also, I feel that you can learn a lot about life and how these group of characters have grown as a family and going through all kinds of situations in life and worked together as a team as they journey their way through space. These characters really bring their episodes, to near real life like situations that is so compelling that sometimes I feel like they are actually real people.

Actors don't seem stilted as in some of the other series, lots of depth, episodes move between characters as the focus for each episode.

2132617,1,B0002WZTCA,"Not nearly as good as the original series. All later takeoffs from the original has way too much utopianism in it. The original series has this concept in it but all the later series just is totally engulfed in it. All the characters need work. The development needs to be consistent. The next generation had a borg that was separated from the hive and became an individual, in I Borg. The context of that show seems to indicate that he became a borg shortly after birth without any previous memories. Voyager had 3 borg separated from the hive who had many memories of their previous life. In Unimatrix 1 there were many borg who had memories of their former lives. Seven of Nine had the hardest time becoming more human. This didn't make sense to me, the more memories of a previous life should make it easier. Paris and Kim should have been more developed and both should have been stronger, they came off too much like adolescents. It also had too many crazy aliens, its OK to have a few totally alien lifeforms but if you have too many it becomes a comic book.",1443916800,,1065,4.466666666666667

As well, her behavior and judgment can be erratic, violating the Prime Directive at times where no rationale was sound for so doing.  And at other times perhaps sticking to it but subectively.
  She's certainly no Picard or Sisco (both of whom seemed to have minor psych issues which they wrestled with but did not let wreck their overall performance.)

Voyager is classic sci-fi. It's not the best installment of the Trek universe, but it's amazingly good science fiction.

The show has 1 obvious story arc from start to finish, about the Voyager trying to travel the full length of the galaxy to get back to Earth. But along the way they have plenty of mini adventures where the crew has to pull together despite their differences because they only have each other to rely on. That's the magic of Voyager. The main story arc is ever present but each episode is it's own story.

They face old foes like the Borg (who are everywhere) and friends like Q (because what's a Trek series without Q) and lots of new ones that they meet along the way. The individual episodes remind me of 1950's and 60's sci fi stories, only with much high production value.

Season 5 has the all black and white episode where the crew battles Dr Chotica on the holodeck in the homage to 1940's sci fi. It sounds stupid, but I promise you it works!

Voyager is a fun departure from the Trek series that proceeded it. It's still ""Spacehip flying around meeting aliens"" but it's not constantly arguing with the Klingons and Romulans.

It's well worth watching for the fun ride it is.",1431475200,,1208,4.504587155963303

2132809,5,B0002WZTCA,"Season five picks up where season four leaves off.  The Voyager crew is navigating through Borg space and trying to reach home.  Seven of Nine steals the show in this season (she did in the last season too) as we see strong character development lead her to make crucial choices that affect Voyager's future.  The entire cast bonds very well together, like a close-knit family, which is to be expected after serving for years with each other.  There were many memorable episodes (Drone, Dark Frontier), and the head villain, the Borg Queen, makes her grand entrance onto the stage.  Voyager also gets a nice boost in heading home, which creates the growing hope that the crew will finally make it back to Earth.  There is a lot of hope and excitement in this season, things the previous seasons lacked (Season 4 had excitement though).  Overall, this is as good as season four.
There are only two minor flaws in the season, the Doctor and the season finale.  Because of Seven of Nine, the Doctor (and other characters) take a backseat in terms of limelight and center stage.  But that's to be expected since Seven of Nine is the reason why the Borg Queen reveals herself.  The season finale, Equinox, was weak compared to Season 3's and Season 4's finale.  But other than that, the season is flawless.

2132896,4,B0002WZTCA,"Season 5 is a good season of Voyager. There are many episodes that deal with character personal issues. More so then in other episodes. The central theme seems to be getting to know the crew more. At least that's what it feels like as I am going through it.

2132900,5,B0002WZTCA,"There are two lessons to take away from ""Voyager's"" Season 5: (1) Janeway is captaining a very unstable crew, and (2) Insanity makes for some smashing TV drama.

Yes, Season 5 is by far one of the best of ""Voyager,"" tied with Season 6. But in addition to being a fantastic season, this one is noteworthy for being the season where every regular character lost their sanity at least once. Here's a short run-down...

*  ""Night:"" Feeling she's failed her crew, Janeway locks herself in her quarters for a month, speaking only to Chakotay and her coffee
*  ""Extreme Risk:"" A clinically depressed B'Elanna takes up dare-devil sports as a method of self-harm
*  ""Infinite Regress:"" Seven develops split-personality disorder.
*  ""Latent Image:"" The Doctor loses it when he fails to save a patient
*  ""Bride of Chaotica!"" The holodeck itself goes insane, forcing Tom, Harry, the Doctor and Janeway to act out the adventures of  Captain Proton
*  ""Bliss:"" The entire crew, sans Seven, the Doctor and Naomi, are hypnotized by a giant alien pretending to be a wormhole home to Earth
*  ""The Fight:"" After four and a half years of being the only sane man aboard, Chakotay finally snaps and punches Tuvok
*  ""Relativity:"" Captain Braxton returns, as zany as ever (well, one of them).
*  ""Warhead:"" The Doctor gets possessed by a sentient nuclear weapon

...and most of those are fantastic episodes.

Other gems to watch for include the tear-jerkers ""Course Oblivion"" and ""Timeless;"" the Borg-based two-parter ""Dark Frontier,"" where the Borg Queen makes her debut; and thought-provoking episodes like ""Counterpoint;"" ""Drone;"" and ""Nothing Human.""

Aside from all the delightful insanity, another one of the major strengths of Season 5 is the guest stars. This season is chalk-full of fantastic one-time characters, whose time onscreen is never wasted. The tragic One from ""Drone;"" Janeway's brief lover Kashyk, and the comical Dr. Tarat, in ""Counterpoint;"" the grizzled monster-hunter in ""Bliss;"" and the delightfully mad Captain Braxton in ""Relativity"" are just a few examples.

And then there are the aliens. Off of the rubber-forehead-douche kick from the Fourth Season, Season 5 gives us a highly advanced insectoid species, whose language can't be deciphered by the Federation translator (""Nothing Human""); a nebula-sized, space-dwelling life form that induces hallucinations to lure prey into its gullet  (""Bliss""); a humanoid race that commits genocide against telepaths (""Counterpoint""); an amphibian-like man whose nose provides some memorable comic relief (also ""Counterpoint""); some charmingly campy-looking, antenaed humanoids (""Infinite Regress""); and light-based beings from another dimension (""Bride of Chaotica""). Many of these aliens remind one of the ""Original Series,"" or even ""Farscape,"" in their creativity or outlandishness. Season 5 not only seems to have a better budged than previous seasons, but the writers now seem more willing to have fun and take risks with their aliens, in a franchise than normally tip-toes around the idea of aliens that are ""too out there.""

Finally, the character development. There is lots of it in Season 5. Naturally, there's the Seven-uncovering-her-humanity arc. In this season her friendship with the Doctor grows, and he develops his infamous crush on her. B'Elanna's journey this season focuses on her emotional battles; first she confronts her much-delayed grief over the Maquis genocide in ""Extreme Risk,"" and later in ""Juggernaut,"" learns to wield her anger as a controlled tool. Chakotay, often considered an underdeveloped character, gets to shine as B'Elanna's mentor (""Extreme Risk"" and ""Juggernaut""), as his usual rule-breaking self (in ""Timeless"" and ""Night""), and his obligatory gone-crazy episode ""The Fight,"" which provides a far better backstory for his character than Season 2's ""Tattoo."" Harry Kim gets command of the Night Shift, and proves his capabilities in ""Timeless,"" ""Warhead,"" and ""Course Oblivion."" Other characters get good treatment too, but I can't go on forever.

VERDICT:
One of the best seasons by far. Creative, character-driven, emotional, and with a decent budget.",1418169600,,4144,5.386996904024768

2132993,5,B0002WZTCA,Star Trek Voyager is good sci-fi that the whole family can enjoy. The special effects effects may not be as good as what we have now but it has a very good plot line and acting. I highly recommend this show. Many of the actors are still in modern shows and some have gone on to be Directors.,1403827200,,291,4.0344827586206895
2132994,5,B0002WZTCA,"Though this episode was very slow the first time I saw it on TV in 99 it has grown on me more and more, it's just a what happened way back when the show was being produced(more or less) and although there are certainly better story-lines in voy at least we got to see a peek of what was going on with the good capt's family in the time-frame this was being filmed. Though it does have its slow times I have to say something would be lacking if it was missing. Although this is a lack-luster episode it's still Trek and anything with Trek is good stuff imo unless it has ""Q"" in it I despise Q almost to the point of I can't watch it and only do normally as part of a watch through the series  Well hope this review has been helpful to someone pls rate it helpful if it was, thx.",1403481600,,777,3.980769230769231

Previously I had, of course, watched the Original Star Trek and all the movies past and current. I just love the continuity of Star Trek. I had watched a lot of Star Trek TNG so I watched them all. Then I looked into the other series and found they had 7 seasons which means they were probably good. First I watched Deep Space Nine, which was completely different. I loved it. Now I'm on my 7th season of Voyager, which is again, on a Star ship, but different. I almost hate to have them end. But, I still have the Enterprise series left. Watch all of the series.

2133025,4,B0002WZTCA,It was great to watch this series again without commercials and I didn't have to wait to watch a two part story. But when I watch it again I am suprised at the inconsistency of the writers storylines and some of the personality changes of the main characters from episode to episode.

2133036,4,B0002WZTCA,"Too much stopping to snoop into things that should not interest them. There are enough alien races in this series to fill the Super Bowl. Even Seven of Nine has to tell Janeway what the species Borg number designation is every time they meet someone. Wow, but the Delta quadrant is overpopulated! Also, how does Voyager keep on going toward home and leave someone behind who eventually catches up by shuttle craft or transporter? I though these things had a distance limit. However, if you don't have the Kirk or Picard series available, it's worth watching.",1394582400,,558,4.822916666666667

2133052,5,B0002WZTCA,"I really like the way all the characters are fully developed and how their characters have evolved over the seasons.  The show is intriguing in that it causes one to wonder about potential real future technological and social challenges.  Example:  Does giving an artificial intelligent program social and personality subroutines constitute creation of a soul?  If a hologram can since should it be encouraged to explore day dreams?  How would a crew handle a child on a long voyage in space?  and so much more.  differently a well thought out replacement for the original Star Trek generation children and their children.  Better acting, story lines and more relevant science.  One for this  and the millennial generation.",1391990400,,723,5.155172413793103

Some who love the show and have deep pockets will buy these at this too. Season 5 sees Voyager making some progress to towards the Alpha Quadrant. The character of 7 of 9 seems better embed with the Janeways crew. Some of the seasons narratives, we see Species 8472 in a more human element.  There is the accidental creation of a Super Borg and we meet a Nazis like xenophobic race who persecute telepaths with unnatural cunning zeal. The stories mentioned are just a sample of good season. All in all a very good series with a great female captain who really held her own, its a real pity that the whole TV franchise has not explored more of the Star Trek Universe.",1389312000,,830,4.354838709677419

but it stands to reason, since it's star trek, and they're all about the la dee da utupia in most series.",1389312000,,481,4.355555555555555

2133141,1,B0002WZTCA,"The Star Trek Voyager series is proof that the entire Star Trek franchise should have just ceased after the completion of Star Trek Next Generation.  The story lines in Voyager are dull and a sure cure for insomnia.  I think the entire series was based around the premise(gimmick) of having a female ship's captain.  How this POS series ever made it for even one season let alone seven confirms to me the wisdom of the character J.R. Ewing from Dallas when he remarked, ""Well, you know Bobby, nobody ever went broke by underestimating the intelligence of the American public!""",1378512000,,576,4.797979797979798

2133143,4,B0002WZTCA,"Star Trek Voyager presents some great philosophical conundrums - a battle between what is right and what makes sense for their situation. I love the episodes where the crew is butting up against the Prime Directive, it makes you think about what is really the right thing, or the wrong thing. This season gets into some weird sci-fi concepts, they are exciting. We really enjoyed this season. It poses moral dilemmas at times. My husband and I watch this and then discuss whether we would have done the same. We often say out loud ""I agree with Janeway on this one"", or ""I totally disagree!"".

The ONLY issue I take with any of the Star Trek Voyager, is the over-sexification of Seven of Nine. If you are the logical type who gets into the show and hates finding logical flaws, this will eventually dawn on you. She is borg, a great character, and I really enjoy her emotionless data-like character - being Borg she is into everything being ""efficient"". (Her and the doctor are a hilarious bunch.) BUT -come on - is wearing high heels, and a corset, really ""efficient""? Or makeup for that matter? And, how is a skin tight boob-suit really borg-like? Why would a borg focus so much on her appearance, where did she learn about heels while on a borg ship? So why would she prefer them? Clearly, it makes no sense for her to understand that concept, but not any other human concept. It's there illogically, for pure sex-appeal. You will wonder - WHY can't she wear a star trek uniform? She wore one once and looked fantastic, and like part of the crew, she shined. It suited her. Instead they make her look like a cat-woman dancer in heels in a boob corset . Don't say ""she didn't earn a uniform"", neither did Chakotay, but he wears one.
BUT, don't let that stop you. You will get past her appearance, and she is an awesome character. She grows on you.",1378252800,,1849,4.502976190476191

This is probably the most well developed, dynamic cast from any of the Trek franchises, and Season 5 is one of the most gripping and dark episodes in this series.

2133159,5,B0002WZTCA,"I do think the series gets better with each season. Season five was truly a great season with great episodes. I won't describe each episode but there are those that really Stand out. Here is my list of ""stand out"" episodes:

Extreme Risk: Various crewmembers propose and start to build a specialized shuttlecraft--the Delta Flyer. It will be seen and used throughout the remainder of the series. It becomes a race when an alien race is building their own specialized craft. Voyager has a probe stuck in a gas giant and that alien race wants it. In the end the Delta Flyer is built and Voyager gets it's probe back. Also B'Elanna Torres is dealing with depression caused by bad news she received from the Alpha Quadrant. Because of that depression she places herself in dangerous stunts in the holodeck. In time B'Elanna comes to grips with the cause of the depression and is cured.

Thirty Days: The episode opens with Lt. Tom Paris being demoted to ensign and being sentenced to 30 days in the brig. In flashback Voyager crew is seen meeting with delegates from an ocean world. The planet is losing water mass and could be destroyed in five years. So Lt. Paris and some of the planets scientists take the Delta Flyer to the planets center. They find the problem and report back. The Voyager crew would be told that the planets governing body won't do what's necessary to solve the problem. This upsets Lt. Paris but Captain Janeway clings to the Prime Directive. So Lt. Paris and one of the planets scientist take the Delta Flyer and attempt to take matters into their own hands. They are stopped. Tom Paris is reduced to ensign and sent to the brig for thirty days.

Latent Image: The doctor is taking holographic images of the Voyager crew. He sees that Ensign Harry Kim had surgery and only the doctor could have performed it. But the doctor had no memory of performing the surgery. The doctor discovers that some of his memory files had been deleted and concluded that it was intentional. So when he confronts Captain Janeway he learns the truth. On an away mission Ensign Kim and another crewperson was attacked by an alien race. The doctor could only save one. So he chooses to treat Ensign Kim and the other crewperson dies on the operating table. This causes problems with the part of the doctors programming that required being impartial. So that incident would be deleted from the doctors memory. The doctor would admit to treating Ensign Kim because he was close to him. Initially Captain Janeway wanted to again delete that from the doctor's memory but after a conversation with Seven of Nine she would allow him to retain those memories but help him cope with the choice made.

Timeless: 100th episode and a standout. Takes place 15 years in the future. Fifteen years earlier Voyager attempted to use slip stream technology to speed up their trip home. Problems are detected so Ensign Kim and Commander Chakotay would fly in front of Voyager in the Delta Flyer to call out necessary adjustments. Things go horribly wrong and Voyager crashes on and ice world killing everyone on board. Harry Kim and Chakotay make it to tha Alpha Quadrant. In time the search for Voyager is called off. Kim and Chakotay search on their own. They find Voyager. They revive the doctor and use stolen Borg technology to attempt so send a message 15 years back in time to Voyager via Seven of Nine. A special appearance is made by LeVar Burton as Captain Geordi LaForge whose mission is to stop Kim and Chakotay. In the end Kim and Chakotay succeed in getting the message to Voyager. The slip stream is turned off and Voyager is saved.

Dark Frontier: Voyager destroys a Borg probe and uses the data nodes to locate a heavily damaged Borg sphere nearby. Captain Janeway plans a heist to take a transwarp coil which could shave time off the trip home. The mission to take the coil suceeds but Seven of Nine gets lured back to the Borg collective. The rest of the episode has Seven of Nine  dealing with the Borg queen. A rescue attempt is planned and after a series of events Seven of Nine is rescued and a Borg pursuit evaded. Voyager uses the Borg transwarp coil and shaves 15 years off their voyage.

Course, Oblivion: The beginning of this episode would throw me off. It starts with the wedding of Lt. B'Elanna Torres and Lt. Tom Paris. In an earlier episode (Thirty Days) Tom Paris was demoted to ensign. Immediately after the wedding B'Elanna's cell structure breaks down killing her. With the doctor's findings and other readings the crew determines they are duplicates of the real Voyager and Voyager crew when Voyager landed on a Class Y demon planet (""Demon"" Season 4). The biomimetic compound that makes up the ship and crew is breaking down. With that the duplicate Captain Janeway orders the ship back to that Class Y planet. Enroute more crewmembers and ship systems break down. An attempt to launch a time capsule with ship/crew information fail. Failing sensors detect a ship in communications range. A distress message is sent out and received by that ship-the real Voyager. Voyager heads toward the toward the coordinates but when they arrive all that's left of the duplicate Voyager is biomimetic liquid. Captain Janeway makes a note of the rescue attempt and resumes it's course to the Alpha Quadrant.

Equinox: A two part cliffhanger that ends Season Five and will begin Season Six. Voyager receives a distress call by another Federation starship-Equinox. Equinox is under attack by nucleogenic lifeforms. The Equinox was pulled into the Delta Quadrant by the same caretaker array that pulled Voyager. It becomes apparant that the Equinox crew is hiding something which is verified by an area of Equinox that cannot be accessed due to intentional overrides. Voyager's doctor is sent to investigate. The doctor finds that the Equinox crew has been harvesting bio-energy from the creatures killing them in the process. The Equinox crew is taken into custody. The Equinox captain explains that they have been using that bio-energy to fuel an enhanced warp drive which would speed up their trip home. The doctor continues to explore the Equinox. In time he activates Equinox's EMH (an EMH-1). That EMH affirms he helped with the process after his ethical subroutines had been deleted. That EMH attacks the doctor and takes his mobile emmitter and goes to Voyager and helps the Equinox crew escape while stealing Voyager's shield generator and capturing Seven of Nine. The episode ends with Equinox escaping and Voyager under attack by the nucleogenic creatures.

That sums up a great season for what has become a great series. I look forward to watching Season Six. I would have no problems with the discs. Also Amazon would do it's usual good job of getting the item to me in a timely manner. I used the fee free Super Saver shipping. Again good job.",1374883200,,6859,4.766835016835016

2133175,5,B0002WZTCA,"The Voyager series was the first to step into new possibilities:  The Captain was a woman, played excellently the Captain was female, tough when it was called for and in command, yet she never lost any of her softer aspects.  The second landmark was portraying a black actor in the role of a Vulcan.

One of the things I liked about this series is it showed many aspects of humanity.  One that I really enjoyed was the spiritual aspects.  For years science fiction has danced around the subject but this brought it out and laid it on the table as a viable part of the people.

The characters are very well played out by the actors, especially that of Captain Janeway, Seven-of-Nine, and Ensign Harry Kim, as well as B'Lana Torres and the Doctor.  The idea of a journey trying to get ""home"" and meeting all kinds of people, encountering all kinds of odds while trying to keep and preserve your individual values and beliefs, not to mention traditions under the ""prime directive"" rule, is so appealing and so much like 'real-life' drama.

Season 5 of ST voyager is one of my favorite second only to season 4 (when 7 of 9 was brought to the show).

I want to take this opportunity to list a few of my favorites for this season starting with the first one called Night in which the crew are traveling through a starless part of space.  I also loved the episode Timeless, Course Oblivion, and the last episode Equinox.  Captain Janeway again holds up Starfleet ideals and principles against difficult situations.  Equinox is a fine example of those principles.  I highly recommend Star Trek Voyager to all Science fiction fans especially seasons 3,4,5, and 7.

2133255,4,B0002WZTCA,"I liked this one a lot. It progressed really s-l-o-w-l-y, although that's probably because every other Voyager episode seems to rush by, as though the writers try to cram as much into one episode as possible. This is the exception -- that one track on an album by your favorite band that chooses to abandon the usual worn-out song structure in favor of a more free-form style. Here we have another representation of 20th-century history, but this isn't ""Future's End"" where the writers make a point to juxtapose the futuristic Voyager crew against the weird 20th-century Earth-dwellers. Instead, this episode plays out like Janeway's holonovel (or ""Remember"" way back in Season 3). It's like a short story -- you're given a window into a larger world. Obviously it's still a TV show and not a movie, so the window is really small, but I thought it was well done enough that you can use your imagination to fill in the rest. Needless to say, I was engrossed.",1347667200,,957,4.736526946107785

2133258,4,B0002WZTCA,"Season 5 of Star Trek Voyager has some good episodes, but it's also clear the show has become the ""Seven and Doctor Show"". Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine and Robert Picardo as the Doctor consistently get the best dialogue, perform the best acting, and star in  the best episodes. Kate Mulgrew as Captain Janeway also gets consistently strong characterization, but the rest of the crew seems like they fell by the wayside.

Season 5 started out with a really interesting premise, with Janeway in depression and the crew traveling through a starless void. This is exactly what I'd hoped to see more of in Voyager - the crew going through psychological stress on their voyage home. However, this tension only lasts for one episode before we get back to business as usual. What a wasted opportunity.",1347062400,,791,4.766423357664234

2. Relativity

Janeway: ""Broken?....never""

well that's the hugest lie that was ever told...just from the events covered in the episodes I don't have enough to fingers to count how many times she's broken it.

Aside from that script fudge this was an awesome episode, just when things were getting a little lonely another Starfleet vessel is found in the Delta Quadrant. EXCITING! The crew is varied, and seem to have experienced the Quadrant in a much different way (they are a science vessel with barely any weapons, warp 8, and a crew that's never seen conflict). But guess what? You can't a happy go lucky feeling Voyager episode now can we? Quite a twist in this one :)

All in all a very interesting season ender, can't wait for more Voyager.",1342656000,,790,4.7101449275362315
2133277,3,B0002WZTCA,"Okay let me just first say that this was a mildly entertaining episode, though you do have to suspend your disbelief further than usual (and assume a LOT). It's definitely worth watching, because the story and writing keep you engaged. So I'll leave it at that, now the rest will be *SPOILER* territory and a bit more critical, so don't read on if you are sensitive about defending Voyager or Star Trek.

WHY ARE THEY MAKING SENTIENT SELF-AWARE BOMBS IN THE FUTURE?! Seriously someone explain that logic to me? A bomb that can decimate an entire planet is given a personality and the ability to make mistakes and decisions on it's own? I'll repeat what I said about the other episode with a sentient Bomb...think about a Nuclear bomb...what engineer in their right mind would give it a personality and ability to go against it's own programming and commands? NONE, that is so dangerous and borders on retardation.

These types of episodes also bring up a HUGE problem I've always seen in the Star Trek universe. Why are there still manned war ships? Or why doesn't everyone just fire smart bombs at each other from the safety of their own planet? It's only 2012 and already Boeing and Lockheed have predicted by 2020 all jet fighters will be unmanned remote controlled or AI controlled like our Predators....imagine 400-500 years from now wars would be irrelevant because of how fast they'd be over. For instance look at the US/Russia/Korea...if we ever got into a war it'd be *FIRE THE NUKES* and war over in an hour; Earth destroyed...nuclear winter, uninhabitable, everyone dead.",1342656000,,1582,4.833948339483395
2133278,5,B0002WZTCA,"This episode is heavy on the Seven of Nine and Time Travel, those are reason are enough to watch it :) The plot does get a bit ludicrous, almost like ""Inception"" was when they just kept going deeper...but the writing and the way the characters handle each situation really grounds the story and makes it believable. I'll also mention that the two guest stars are awesome actors that are fairly well known nowadays (one was the lead detective on ""The Shield"" and the other has been in EVERYTHING).

Pure joy to watch and barely any drag in the story [4.5 out of 5]",1342656000,,563,4.466019417475728
2133279,5,B0002WZTCA,"Seven of Nine has become more and more curious about ""Human mating rituals"", but what she thinks is just a purely scientific analysis is much more. The real fun of this episode comes from the fact that it's the EMH that is teaching Seven about Human relationships; obviously he is not qualified (though he thinks he is), as Tom said ""...the blind leading the blind"". And thanks to some wonderful writing and acting, Seven's first date felt authentic and it was even cute. I was grinning like an idiot this whole episode, and an instant classic for this series.

I especially loved the moment @ 9:50....Robert Picardo is amazing :D",1342656000,,630,4.7272727272727275

Very interesting stuff especially if you've been paying attention!

A minor gripe I had was that Janeway's plan seems out of character, and it seems to come from out of nowhere. I wish the writers would have done a better job of catching the rest of us up on exactly how much the Borg had been pestering Voyager. As far as the audience is concerned they haven't been, so I guess we just have to imagine Voyager has been under constant threat :\",1342569600,,817,4.339869281045751

This episode is just solid; from the story to the logic, it's just darn good Sci-Fi and it's worthy of the Trek name. In most Voyager episodes the script will confuse the audience with Treknobabble and hope that we just take it all with a grain of salt, but here it's an actual dilemma that is tangible, clever, and enjoyable to watch.  [ 4.5 out of 5 ]

On a side note: I've found that there is a strong correlation between how much I like an episode and how little of Janeway is in it. I've been in a state of flux for almost 5 season now on whether she even adds anything to her own show....In comparison after seeing the second episode of TNG I knew what Picard was about, saw his complexity, and got why he was a captain. Have yet to see that from Janeway on Voyager; it might be her pompous attitude, that smug look stuck on her face, or even how she flip-flops on her own ideals all the time...I don't know",1342569600,,1011,4.153061224489796

The only thing I disliked about the episode was that it's left massively open-ended....and knowing Voyager's writers this will most likely never be brought up again or even acknowledged in any episode down the line (this show has no concept of continuity).

It's a solid 4 out of 5 not a fraction more or less; If you love the Doc and a good mystery then you'll love this one.",1342569600,,462,4.566265060240964
2133284,4,B0002WZTCA,"I think all the perfect 5 out of 5s are an indication of just how rare it is when a Voyager episode isn't predictable (I smell desperation). It's a solid story, but c'mon...it pales in comparison to truly great episodes like ""Timeless"", ""Drone"", and ""One"".  Up until now the crew and the captain just blindly trust every stranger they meet (predictably leading to them getting royally screwed over) but this time somehow they pull a sherlock holmes and they finally outsmart the bad guys....it only took 120 episodes, but Janeway did it.

The idea that there is a limit to how far your ideals will carry you was brought up and tested in Deep Space Nine so its nice to see it here. What if Voyoger didn't have the resources it had, what might they become? what might they do? Captain Ransom and his crew answer that question nicely.",1342483200,,436,4.518987341772152
2133286,4,B0002WZTCA,"Tom Paris disobeys orders and is sentenced to the brig for 30 days. Why, because he was doing what was right.

This episode advances Tom's character considerably because we see someone who was out for himself actually risk his life to benefit others. There is nothing in it for him and, succeed or fail, he was going to be in trouble.

Also, this gives Trek an opportunty to show that they really do leave people alone. They provided help when asked, and even though further help is needed they let the aliens hang themselves. This sounds bad, but since the Prime Directive says don't interfere, they didn't. It's also nice to see someone punished. It is unreasonable to expect everyone to be good ALL the time, and there must be some levels of existence between Starfleet obidience and full on traitor.",1342483200,,803,4.6879432624113475

This episode is strong for several reasons:

1- it links to a previous episode without creating an arc (meaning you can enjoy this one even if you never saw the episode it relates to.
2- it provides a believable ""what if"" without having to commit
3- the fact that it ends on a sad note has an element of realism that is often missing on tv (not just trek but every show)
4- it shows that just because you are a copy, doesn't mean you can't excel (Spoiler alert- the copies came up with an enhanced warp drive that the originals never thought of).",1342483200,2,674,4.471544715447155

It is a bit refreshing to see a non-humanoid alien (something that happens far to infrequently *cough* low budget *cough*) unfortunately the alien turns out to be rather uninteresting.

*SPOILERS* Some personal thoughts
1) I believe that B'Elanna overreacted to the whole situation...It's a hologram (not the actual person), she didn't have a personal tie to his dark experiments, and are you really going to let yourself die for some noble ideal? In my opinion she was trying to HARD to be a martyr, she still acts like she has nothing to live for....not true anymore.

2) The Voyager crew is SO hypocritical. They are constantly benefitting from Seven of Nine's technology and expertise. Um...excuse me that's BORG knowledge that was gained though killing and forced assimilation of trillions of people....but the Cardassians kill a couple hundred and everyone's all ""OH NOES DATS A MORAL DILEMMA, NO CAN USE KNOWLEDGE GAINED"" *facepalm*",1342483200,2,1071,5.079545454545454

I can't recommend this episode enough, instant favorite.

p.s. for those of you that are a bit more perceptive you're gonna have to suspend your disbelief more than usual in this one...but then again you're probably used to that by now, it is Voyager after all :D",1342310400,,613,4.773584905660377

As I finished this episode I felt that I could have skipped it and not missed a thing, but maybe that's because I can't relate to clinical depression or PTSD...I've been lucky enough to never have experienced either. Or maybe it's cause these kinda of stories make me feel depressed :\

For a season premiere I would be a bit ashamed to air this on TV...it definitely wouldn't have hooked me and it didn't get me excited for the rest of the season.

And the bizarre side story with Janeway feeling guilt and attempting self-sacrifice is just silly and out of place. She did made a HUGE mistake in the very first episode, but now is not the time and place to deal with that; you're a captain....LEAD THE DAMN SHIP!

*SPOILER*

B'Elanna has a medical problem, and the Doc summons up a Cardassian hologram which might be able to help. Trouble is, his knowledge was gained through horrific practices at a Bajoran death camp.
My beloved Aunt was a teen in Germany circa WWII. She had many loved ones in Nazi death camps. Her opinion of this episode is that to leave unused medical knowledge gained in that way is to nullify the sacrifices and deaths of those whom she loved. When I asked her about the chances of putting some seal of approval on the means, she waves her hand at me and says society's job is to prevent such atrocities. But once they've been perpetrated, using the medical knowledge is the only way to honor the dead.

I still am of two minds on this, and would love to hear other opinions.

2133322,4,B0002WZTCA,"I loved this episode. It illustrated the damage the Borg do to all people it assimilates. Poor Seven of Nine experiences the memories of so, so many people with whom her mind was connected as a Borg drone. It shows, as other recent episodes have, how she becomes more human.

One thing I dislike, although I think I understand it: Seven herself speaks in this episode of the lives she destroyed as a Borg, but in many past episodes other crew members have made the same accusation. (Hush! B'Elanna!)I get that the Borg are fearful. And I'm all in favor of people taking personal responsibility. But once assimilated by the Borg, I believe Seven no longer had a choice in the taking over of other people, and therefore shouldn't be expected to take responsibility for any damage done, or be made to feel guilt over it.

I think Jeri Ryan did a great job acting in this ep, and I'm excited to see the writers show her growing as an individual.",1334275200,,941,4.497076023391813

It could have been done in a different manner, but to me this seemed a good supposition for a Klingon.

Many times during my viewings of episodes I will find myself pausing, and rewinding to get a better look at something in the frame. The people who worked hard to make this show a reality really outdid themselves in every aspect. It is just a beautiful and well-detailed show.

The episodes stories are all very interesting as well. Especially the ones involving 7 of 9, played by Jeri Ryan. She really helped to pump new life into this series.

It features yet another deception at getting home, many Borg episodes and life aboard voyager. I believe that Thirty days, dark frontier and Coarse: Oblivion where my favorite episodes. We all know about Tom's and Admiral Paris's tense relationship and season 5 was the the start of unveiling an amazing story between a war hero and his sun. Dark frontier 7 of 9 struggles with humanity. She makes a decision to save voyager at the sack of her individuality. Coarse: Oblivion is what star trek is all about, mystery, intrege. In season 4, im sorry i forget the specific episode, Voyager encounters a y class planet, which they call a demon class planet. Tom and harry go down in environmental suits, unfortunetly an accident occurs which forces tom and Harry into the atmosphere with out thier suits. However they survive. To make a long story short, the crew discovers a almost changling like organism, which they call the silver blood, at the end the crew is coppied and a new voyager crew is born identical to the old one. In Coarse: Oblivion the episode starts like any other, however strange things begin to happen. My first sign of an alternate reality or some sort of alien plot was when i saw Tom Paris wearing the pin's of a lieutenant when he had been demoted to ensign. Anyways, the episode goes on to be excellent. Great season, Great writting, Great everything, I think the two words to sum all of that up is ""Star Trek.""",1293408000,,1565,4.60931899641577
2133337,5,B0002WZTCA,"My memories of Voyager, when it originally aired, are of a struggling TNG retread. Upon rewatching the series years later, I was rather impressed by some of the early seasons. The first held up significantly better than I would have expected. The next couple years had some solid moments, but there were many mediocre and poor episodes that reminded me why I had originally been disappointed. Things started to change with the addition of Seven of Nine in season four. Though she was the central focus of too many episodes, detracting a bit from some of the other characters, the show did start to find more of a focus, and the writing began to improve. And then in season five, Voyager truly came into its own. Episode after episode impresses: Night, Timeless, Nothing Human, Counterpoint, Dark Frontier . . . and arguably the finest episode of the entire series, Latent Image.

It may have taken a little longer than I would have liked to get there, but Voyager grew into a first class show, and its three final seasons stand up alongside the finest of any other Star Trek season. The characters, the stories, the ethical questions - all the best of what science fiction is all about - are here.

2133358,4,B0002WZTCA,"Star Trek Voyager is my favorite of the Star Trek franchise.  I think what appeals to me is that, unlike the other series that basically have them tooling around in their own little quadrant of the galaxy, Voyager is flung to an extraordinarily distant quadrant with little hope of getting back in their lifetime.  The underlying mission of getting home along with the Star Trek standard fare gave more meaning to them being out there.  The character of The Doctor was always entertaining, and once they brought in Seven-of-Nine and phased out Kes (never liked her) the series really took off, as she was easy on the eyes as well and very logical to complement the Vulcan Tuvok (the logical characters in all Star Trek were my favorites).  Since others have done a fine job of describing the episodes, I'll leave it at that.

The only disappointment with the DVD collection is the cheap cases.  They are basically storybook slim style jewels in different colors held together with really strong tape.  Voyager was never fully accepted in Trekdom, and this is reflected in the distributor spending the barest minimum on the collection.

About the case, I had ordered all seasons individually over time from Amazon as they went on and off sale, and the case was always broken on #5.  I asked if they could specifically inspect a copy before they send it, and they said no.  I was trying to help them by letting them know there stock was damaged, but they didn't seem to care.  In fact, after the fourth broken case, they told me that I would probably never be pleased and to go shop somewhere else!  Gratefully, Overstock.com has a price matching program and was glad to do business with me.  The copy I received from them was flawless on the first try.",1244246400,,1751,4.664495114006515

2133364,4,B0002WZTCA,"Overall, season five of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" offers a very good batch of episodes.  Even the few shows that are a little clunky at least have some interesting ideas being explored.  But mostly you get intense, engaging episodes with top-notch special effects.  Quick shout-outs go to the creepy ""Night"", the very amusing ""Bride of Chaotica!"", and the gritty Borg two-parter, ""Dark Frontier"".

And there's a great season closer, ""Equinox, Part One"", where the stranded Voyager crew meets up with another lost Starfleet vessel, one whose captain and crew are willing to cross quite a few lines to find a way to get back home, lines Captain Janeway and her crew would never cross, or at least haven't yet. This look at what Voyager and her crew members could have themselves become- or might yet become?- is quite compelling, and results in a darn fine episode (though you'll have to buy season six to see how it ends).  And it's only one of many fine episodes.

The DVD set of the fifth season of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" includes the usual generous special features, and quality picture and sound.  And Paramount finally dropped the price of this and other ""Trek"" boxed sets down into the ""reasonably priced"" realm.  Get 'em while they're still there!",1214956800,,1246,4.84433962264151

2133366,4,B0002WZTCA,"STAR TREK: VOYAGER is an unusual show in that its worst seasons were the earliest.  Virtually all shows ever made were better in their first half than in the second half, but VOYAGER is one of the few exceptions.  There are two reasons for the dramatic improvement in the show over its final four seasons.  First, an increasing amount of serial content.  No doubt part of this was the result of a growing number of other shows on at the same time with serial formats.  Whatever the cause, as more and more elements carried over from one episode to later episodes, the more interesting the series became.  The second reason for the improvement in the show was the emergence of Seven of Nine as the show's most compelling character.  Very shortly after her introduction at the start of Season Four, Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine became by far the most crucial character in most of the best episodes.  VOYAGER did not, in fact, feel at all like the same show after Seven's appearance on the series.  And as with the other three seasons featuring Seven, most of the best episodes on the show were Seven-centric.

Still, Season Five did not have as many truly excellent episodes as Season Four.  On the other hand, it did not have nearly as man weak episodes as Seasons One through Three and Season Six.  The two-part ""Dark Frontier"" is one of the exceptions, providing two of the most exciting episodes in the entire run of VOYAGER (again, a pair of episodes focused on Seven of Nine, as she temporarily returns to the Borg, learning that perhaps her having become a member of the crew of Voyager was part of a Borg plan).  Still, the main virtue of Season Five is its persistent excellence, rather than its flashes of greatness.

There are some fun guest appearances in Season Five.  Jason Alexander made one of his first post-SEINFELD appearances in the late season episode ""Think Tank"" (yet another Seven of Nine episode).  John Savage appears in the end of the season episode ""Equinox"" (the second half of which would start Season Six).  I did have a remarkable experience over a two-day period during which I encountered character actor Mark Harelik in three different shows.  I rewatched an episode of the great, great series PUSHING DAISIES entitled ""Bitches,"" in which the owner of a string of puppy stores, played by Harelik, attempts to clone the world's most perfect dog (""man's best, best friend"").  Then I saw him on VOYAGER in ""Counterpoint,"" one of the best episodes of Season Five, as Devore Inspector Kashyk.  His role is one of the finest guest appearances in all of VOYAGER, as he plays a Devore officer who may or may not be attempting to defect from his people and who may or may not be trying to help Voyager.  He and Janeway were really great together.  Finally, I watched the second episode of the new series ELI STONE, and Harelik appeared as a defense attorney.  For a brief period of time he seemed to be everywhere I looked.

All in all, a good season.  But I agree with all those who think Paramount has priced these sets outrageously high.  I own a very large number of shows on DVD, but not a single box set of any Star Trek series.  Instead, I rely on Netflix.  I strongly encourage everyone to refuse to purchase these sets at their current pricing level.  Current technology makes the production of these sets extremely cheap, far cheaper than it cost to make old VHS tapes.  And with little or no fees to be paid for use of music (something that represents a real expense for shows like NORTHERN EXPOSURE or SMALLVILLE) there is little in the way of overhead.  There is a word for what Paramount is doing with the Star Trek DVDs and that word is ""gouging.""  They are gouging fans of the show by forcing people to pay extravagant prices.  There is simply no excuse for any box set to cost more than around $42 after discount.  I can understand a show like ALLY MCBEAL costing more (if it ever makes it onto DVD) because of the licensing fees for its heavy use of music, but not a show like VOYAGER.  The most I can say is that they have lowered the price somewhat.  But it is still way, way too expensive.  The sad part is that if they dropped the cost of the show, they would almost certainly make more money by greatly increased sales.",1202601600,24,4263,4.547244094488189

2133368,4,B0002WZTCA,"Wake up Paramount! Take a cue from your sales on the STTNG sets. Now that you have finally come to your senses and dropped the prices on the sets to where they should have been in the FIRST PLACE, I would imagine that all of the hold-outs (like me) are now buying them.

See, it works like this, 30 minute shows on DVD, for a season, have earned a fair market price of $25-35. So, since Star Trek episodes are an hour long, that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $50-70 range. So, $60 is your sweet spot.

You will be able to take in the obsessive fans with your initial insane pricing points, but everyone else looks at your current price tags, especially with the shoddy packaging that you are still foisting on us, and just laughs and waits for the inevitable price drop. So, do us all a favor and fire your marketing and sales people, drop the price to where it is supposed to be, and earn your sales. Nobody sane is going to pay more than $60 for a season of an hour long/episode TV show on DVD, period.",1169510400,5,1026,4.1767676767676765

2133370,5,B0002WZTCA,"I reviewed season 4, sharing about what I believe, that Voyager contained some of the best ""trek"" writing to date -including Enterprise. Season 5 would probably have to be the summit. There are so many good episodes in this season. Even most Voyager fans agree by the ratings on StarTrek.com. To me, what makes great sci-fi is the ability to have a great storyline with plausible action - not too far fetched (if you know what I mean) By season 5 the focused character development is evidenced by detailed dialog and sub plots. One episode, 11:59 is interesting as a comparison to Next Generation. It begins with a hallway discussion that leads to a detailed sit-down share time. In Next Generation, Picard would have cut it off at the door - very predictable. Seven is now learning to be more human and shares her feelings, the comic relief throughout is quite good with the bantering of Tuvok/Neelix and Seven/Torres. Bride of Chaotica is a hoot. This brings me to another point. Overall, Voyager has many recurring plot loops. For example, Captain Proton was a thread in many episodes as were several other characters (Naomi Wildman). Voyager also improved their technology- they adapted. Quite a realistic possibility right? They kept tech they learned about and season 5 gives examples of this such as the creation of the Delta Flyer, a new shuttle with Borg weapons and shields.  Voyager, unlike, the other ST series, built upon technology-This season also includes more character development. There are several episodes with focus on indiviual issues. The most dramatic involving Seven, the borg queen and Janeway. After all, the series really defines the mysterious borg. Seasons 4-7 of Voyager really help the viewer realize what borg are all about and they fit so well into the storyline. The final episode is great. It is a contrast of principle with Janeway and the other captain expressing the true meaning of integrity. I would say that if you could only own a few of the seasons of Voyager, Season 5 would be one of them.",1136764800,14,2036,4.867435158501441

2133382,4,B0002WZTCA,"Nominated for 30 Emmys, including seven for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series, Star Trek: Voyager continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...

Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...

The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 5) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Night"" in which Capt. Janeway makes the decision to use the Voyager to aid one of its enemies while she reflects on the consequences of the various decisions she's made in the four years that Voyager has been trapped in the Delta Quadrant... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""Nothing Human"" in which B'Elanna becomes violently ill when an alien seizes control of her nervous system, and ""Think Tank"" in which the Voyager is ambushed by an alien race but given a solution to the attack when an alien ""think tank"" comes to its rescue...

2133385,5,B0002WZTCA,"Seasons three and four of Star Trek: Voyager were when the show put its feet on the ground and started to run.  The writing got progressively better.  There were a ton of GREAT GREAT episodes, but I must say that, in my opinion, this fifth season is the most consistent of the ones to date.  There is some great storytelling in this season.  Another great addition to the series was the Delta Flyer.  Let's face it...the Delta Flyer was COOL!  It added a whole new action dimension to the series.  When this season came around, we had enough backstory to really dive into the lives of the characters.  The Borg again return in ""Dark Frontier"".  The Borg are ALWAYS a welcome sight.  They bring action and mystery seemingly everytime they show up.  Tom Paris is reduced in rank in one of my personal favorite episodes of the SERIES in ""Thirty Days"".  How can you beat turning the Delta Flyer into a submarine?  And then, of course, there is ""Timeless"".  Productionwise the 100th episode of the series.  Temporal mechanics and a ship crashing into the ice.  Enough said!  There is, again, a cliffhanger at the end of this season and it's a doozy.  We find out that Voyager is not alone, and the other crew is nowhere near in as good a shape, physically and mentally, as Captain Janeway's valient crew.  This is a great season of television.  Enjoyable all the way through with very few duds.  This could be the best season of the series.

The over-all feel of Season 5 changes the previous ""Lost in Space"" premise of the show and the Star Trek return to exploration.  The Delta Flyer is introduced, new life and new civilizations are explored and most of all...the Borg Queen rises from the ashes of her demise in STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT to become Janeway's most dangerous adversary!  Sit back and come along for the ride...as VOYAGER comes closer to home.",1102982400,2,677,4.6722689075630255
2133387,5,B0002WZTCA,"I really enjoyed this season.  I think my favorite episodes include ""Dark Frontier"" where we see the Borg complex and get to see a species being assimilated.  I also really enjoyed ""Timeless"" where Chakotay and Kim are in the future trying to save their long-dead comrades.  One episode that did have a pretty big error was ""Course: Oblivion.""  In that episode it had been 11+ months since the crew visited the Demon Planet of season 4, 11 months heading towards home.  When the duplicated crew started heading home (opposite direction of the Alpha Quadrant mind you) they are all dying.  A few weeks out from home they almost run into the real Voyager and crew?  That would seem that Voyager was just running around in circles for the better part of a year.  Not to mention the fact that the last episode of season 4 ""Hope and Fear"" they use the quantum slipstream drive to get like another 10,000 light years closer to home.  So just in case you haven't been paying attention, how was it possible for the real Voyager to be near the Demon Planet of season 4?  Anyways, don't worry about this one error, it was the only one I found and the season was otherwise excellent",1102377600,3,1171,4.533333333333333
2133388,3,B0002WZTCA,"As mentioned, before in my other reviews of previous seasons, the start of the fifth season in the fall of 1998, co-creator Jeri Taylor left the show to spend more time with her family. After spending four years trying to make the show less of a boys club, it virtually left Brannon Braga to helm the final 3 seasons (though he would also depart before the start of the last season to begin work on the next spin-off series, Enterprise). Deep Space Nine was heading into its last season, so this would be the last year that two Star Trek shows would compete with each other. There was hope that those fans dedicated to DS9 would come over to Voyager full time. Thusly, once again, the series changed its tone. The stories would be more action, and less talk, but like the four seasons that had passed, the fifth continued its downward spiral of many pointless episodes with a few good ones thrown in to fool you. Of the first 10 episodes of the season, only Timeless, the series 100th episode, showed what Braga once was as just a writer. The script was well done, the direction from former TNG actor LaVar Burton is great (despite his ratings grabbing cameo) and showed us something that Garrett Wang had not been able to do since the series began, show that he really could act. Another bad element reared its head was in Thirty Days, in which Tom Paris is demoted in rank after disobeying orders. This, by now, appeared to be out place for the character- besides Tom's problems were mostly cleared up in Caretaker and really completely resolved by the middle of the series second season. To return to something that already had been elucidated just smacked of writers who had hoped you didn't remember the Tom character from those two seasons. The second half had the semi-good Counterpoint, which showed a Janeway that should have been. She was very bully like, especially when she kidnaps someone to get information. That was a bold Kirk move, and something akin to the ""cowboy diplomacy"" Picard once spoke about. And while Bride of Chaotica was just plain silly, it gave the actors a chance to break out of their confining roles as fascists. Even Mulgrew, while at first reluctant to don the costume of Arachnea, Queen of the Spider People, chews the scenery as only William Shatner as Kirk could. The rest of the season yawned on, with Dark Frontiers being the highlight of the season. And while at close scrutiny, you can see many plot holes -though the biggest has Seven's parents pursuing the Borg long before the Federation had contact with them in TNG episode Q Who, something that to this day remains muddled in conflict -the show works. Susanna Thompson makes a worthy predecessor as the Borg Queen; though it would've been better with Star Trek First Contact's Alice Krige as the Queen. The rest of season went on, with only Relativity being the highlight. A clever script -a clip show if you like- that featured the return of Captain Braxton from season three's Future's End. It was witty and filled with many nuances that only appear once in a while on this series. The season concluded with Equinox, the first cliffhanger since season three's Scorpion. Unfortunately, once again the story was fairly obvious and the characters all were so stereotypical (see Learning Curve), you could easily figure how this story was going to end. And while Ransom was an interesting character and resembled captains from TOS era, most of his crew, however, were just plain too creepy to be likable.",1100908800,8,3501,4.722222222222222

8034049,3,B0002WZTCA,"There were still a few decent episodes this season, but quite a few times there were some real struggles, including ""Doctor Chaotica"" episodes and expecially the Wesley Crusher-esque inclusion of the obnoxious Naomi Wildman (""Once upon a time"" has to be one of the single most tedious and obnoxious episodes of the entire series, if not all of Trek.) Additionally, Seven of Nine continues to remain more of a monotone Barbie doll for the series and remains an unfortunate replacement for the fare more charming Kes character, whom I still find myself missing through this season. Somehow the plights of Seven just don't seem all that interesting, even when the Borg queen shows up (and they never quite explained how she survived being disintegrated by Picard. Maybe I missed that). There were a few well-written episodes this season though, including ""Course: Oblivion"" which presented a fascinating alternate reality of the crew, as well as ""Timeless"" (this season seemed to go heavy into temporal anomalies again, which is fine, but it does get tiring after awhile.)  Seeing Jason Alexander in ""Think Tank"" just didn't work for me, as I can't get beyond his George Costanza character (without his glasses, I can't help but hear him kvetching to Jerry about ""Who steals prescription glasses?"")
