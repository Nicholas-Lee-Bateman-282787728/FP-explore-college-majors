8128082,5,B000FZYW68,"I remember seeing this on Indian programming TV. I had few clues to what was really happening, but the irresistable ""Choli Ke Peeche"" song & dance production made us seek out this movie again and again. I'm buying it with English subtitles. The songs may not be translated (according to another review), but both Hindi lyrics and the translation exist on the web. Search for them. It's worth it to be able to sing along. This is a true blockbuster Bollywood movie: spectacular!",1247011200,2,477,4.759036144578313
