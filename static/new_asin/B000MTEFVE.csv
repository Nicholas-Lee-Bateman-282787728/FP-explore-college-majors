2747182,5,B000MTEFVE,Finally this is coming to dvd.  This show is really great.  Very funny heartwarming sit-com about a family.  It's on thursday  at 8:30/7:30 pm. central on FOX.,1171065600,7,159,4.777777777777778
2747205,4,B000MTEFVE,I saw this show when it aired on television and thought it was funny.  That's what the four stars are for.  However I recently tried ordering season 1 on DVD from 3 different vendors on Amazon and every copy had an issue playing.  I've gotten so fed up with returning and re-ordering that I've given up on owning it :(  It really stinks because I like the show.,1473379200,,361,4.264705882352941
2747206,5,B000MTEFVE,This show is hilarious. Season 2 needs to come to DVD,1471046400,,53,3.909090909090909

2747208,5,B000MTEFVE,"Very good show. I love how they show what each character is thinking as they are about to answer an uncomfortable question. This is something that new shows have copied now. War At Home is not for everyone. However, it is a perfect show for families that have teenagers or that want to remember their teenage years. They really touched many issues that teenagers go through. The show does teach many valuable lessons and it deserves a couple more seasons. Again, if you have teenagers, or you work with teenagers, you will understand the show and will want to watch it again and again. Season 2 is just as good or even better than Season 1.",1468368000,,640,4.525862068965517

2747259,5,B000MTEFVE,"Modern day faster paced ""Grounded For Life"", has a documentary like feel with the characters talking to the camera about the way they really feel.

The show got 2 seasons, only one came out on DVD, funny show, price was $10 worth the money",1395964800,,239,4.431818181818182

2747262,4,B000MTEFVE,"This is a pretty funny show. Not a lot of extras on the DVD that were interesting to me. The episode were funny, but don't have too much re-watch value.

I would recommend this product.",1391040000,,185,4.285714285714286

2747274,5,B000MTEFVE,"I love this family, and their hilarious cut scene Monologs are great and the most stand out thing about the series. As far as the 3 kids, the youngest is the smartest, the oldest boy is thought to be gay, and the daughter is rebellious and outspoken. Sadly I don't think season 2 has been released on DVD. I love Michael Rappaport in everything I have seen of his, but not much of the other actors have gone on from this show, except for Hilary, who played Serena's cousin Charlotte in Gossip Girl for a season.",1390089600,,511,4.333333333333333
2747275,4,B000MTEFVE,I thought this was a good series when it was on tv. Why was it taken off and where is season 2? Good packaging and good transfers. The people all seem to fit the part. Good righting and lots of laughs. Again still waiting for season 2.,1381622400,,235,4.0212765957446805
2747276,2,B000MTEFVE,"I'm no prude but in the first or second episode, the teenage girl explains she's a ""technical"" virgin and then much of this not-so-funny substory hints at her giving but not receving oral sex. Just stupid.

I own a lot of old tv series and there's something about the picture clarity, sharpness, or lighting that almost hurts my eyes.  It's not fuzzy but there's a kind of soft lighting that reminds me of the Charlie's Angels tv series.  I'm no video geek and can't really explain it.

This sitcom reminds me of Married With Children - quirky and crude at the same time.",1377561600,,571,4.514563106796117
2747277,1,B000MTEFVE,"I have a hard time understanding how anyone could rate this above a one.  The comedy is just stupid and the comedic timing is awful - full of awkward pauses, very fake laugh tracks.  I gave it a shot and watched two full episodes hoping it would get better but it didn't.  They were right to cancel this show.",1376265600,3,309,4.203389830508475
2747278,5,B000MTEFVE,I absolutely loved this show when it was still on TV. I was so happy to find it on here and buy it for so cheap. We watched the entire season within a few days.,1375401600,,160,3.6
2747279,1,B000MTEFVE,I give it one star for the price and thats it. Boring show with little plot not funny like said in reveiews but worth the five bucks. I see why this is the only season it died with the producer and writers of this show,1373500800,2,218,3.8666666666666667
2747280,1,B000MTEFVE,"This is a great show, but the first disc of Season 4 would not play properly. I inspected the disc for scratches but not not find any.

Not worth the time to watch, so will sit and collect dust until I decide to sell on Amazon or something like that.  Rate for the seller is perfect, but the series is a burn out.",1372982400,,274,4.037037037037037
2747282,3,B000MTEFVE,not as funny as alot of the reviews said...but I did get a few laughs out of it. I am not really suprised that it didn't make it to a second season.,1361145600,,148,3.65625
2747293,5,B000MTEFVE,"I used to watch this show religiously during it's two season run on Fox. It had above average ratings the 1st season, but because the decision-makers at Fox kept moving it's time slot around, it lost most of it's following during the 2nd season.

Buying it on DVD had been on my radar for a while, so I finally pulled the trigger, and got the 1st season from a seller on Amazon Marketplace ( by the way, that seller's service was superb ... I had this DVD set in 3 days !! ) for a great price ( incl. shipping,  less than $6.00 TOTAL COST ).

I have watched about 15 of the 22 episodes ... all very funny ... plus an added bonus is viewing the  ultra -hot  Anita Barone who plays Vicky Gold, the Mom.

Unfortunately, Season Two has not been released on DVD ... I hope they eventually do, 'cause it's full of laughs !",1356480000,,816,4.132911392405063
2747294,5,B000MTEFVE,This show is hilarious. I watched it when it originally aired and love it. It still holds up 7 years later. Michael Rapaport is wonderful as a dad who loves it family but isn't sure that he likes them. The show deals frankly with sex including teenage sex. I think if this show had not aired on Fox it would still be on the air. It was much funnier than Everybody Loves Raymond or According to Jim. So sad that it never found an audience.,1351900800,2,438,4.1647058823529415
2747295,5,B000MTEFVE,"If you can get past Michael Rappaport waving his arms around like he's trying to land a plane as he speaks all his lines of dialogue, then this show is HILARIOUS.  I thought ""The War at Home"" was pretty funny when it originally aired, and the Season 1 DVD was cheap enough through Amazon for me to take a flyer on it and watch it again.  Honestly, it is even funnier than I thought the first time around.  The show is a classic, and it holds up on repeat viewings.  Moreover, they were ahead of their time interjecting short confessionals for the characters in a fully-scripted show.  This format has been somewhat duplicated by ""The Office"" and ""Modern Family"", except these shows use the convention under the guise of ""making a documentary"" (But  who is to see these documentaries?  Seemingly, they are for no one).  Unfortunately, ""The War at Home"" will never be as highly regarded as those other two shows I mentioned, and it just might be the funniest of the three.",1342051200,2,970,4.566473988439307
2747296,5,B000MTEFVE,"The same way we hardly take umbrage at ""dirty"" limericks, fraught with the most bawdy, outrageously exaggerated sexual scenarios...so, too, it is near impossible (except for an anachronistic Victorian prude) to look with jaundiced reproach at THE WAR AT HOME.

This hilarious cynical series is a brilliant, self-deprecating paraody on the sexual/emotional dysfunctionality of your ""typical"" average American family, whose ever-squabbling, neurotic members -- all with nasty, supercharged little egos -- work in heated disharmony to create one riotous ""melodrama"" after another.",1327968000,,577,6.036585365853658
2747297,5,B000MTEFVE,This show is one of the best shows Fox has done.  It seems like Fox treats the good shows like they are red-headed step children and lets the garbage stay on the air forever.  I will never understand why they do this.,1322784000,16,217,4.142857142857143
2747298,5,B000MTEFVE,"This is one of the few shows Fox had that should never of been canceled. I really hope season 2 gets released as well, shame it's not still on the air.",1320192000,4,151,3.903225806451613
2747299,5,B000MTEFVE,I remember skipping this when it originally aired because I just figured it was some kind of Titus knock off and I never liked Titus to begin with.  I can say that I haven't laughed this hard watching a DVD in I can't remember how long.  The Gold's are also somewhat unique you do not see a nuclear family on television much anymore.  I'm always up for a good excuse to break the 4th wall.  I cannot see this show continuing until 2011 but it deserved more then the two seasons it got.  If Fox were to release the 2nd season on DVD I know I would buy it.,1313020800,4,554,4.045871559633028
2747300,5,B000MTEFVE,This is one of the funniest shows I've ever watched. Can't believe there were only 2 seasons!!!  Great entertainment value. Highly recommend if you like to laugh!!!!,1303689600,4,165,5.111111111111111
2747301,5,B000MTEFVE,this is a hilarious show its funny all the time wish the second season was on dvd sadly it is not,1300406400,5,97,3.6666666666666665
2747302,5,B000MTEFVE,"I love this show. It's hilarious and I wish it lasted longer. It's like Married With Children mixed with Family Ties! In the dysfunctional Gold family, we have Dave, Vicky, Larry, Hillary, and Mike who always clash with each other. In the early episodes, Dave believes that his son, Larry is gay. Hillary is always trying to be sexy to make her dad mad. Throughout the season, Larry crossdresses and steals his mom's car, Hillary wants implants, Larry runs away, Mike wants a Bar Mitzvah, and much more. I highly recommend THE WAR AT HOME: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON!!!",1291420800,2,568,4.747474747474747
2747313,5,B000MTEFVE,"This show is very funny, well-written & good characters with better-than-average acting.  Seller was very cordial in her e-mail exchanges with me and shipped it immediately. In fact, I would absolutely purchase Seasons 2 and 3 if they were available.  I definitely advise fans of good comedy shows to purchase this DVD set. It was one of those shows that never took off, and why, I'll never know. Every character is backed by excellent actors and the writers who kept the storylines interesting.  A 5-star viewing experience!!",1285545600,2,526,5.022988505747127

2747319,5,B000MTEFVE,"This was without a doubt a highly underrated comedy series....but unfortunally, it was so underrated & overlooked that after having it change timeslots various times during the two season that the show was eventually cancelled & I highly doubt that there will be a season 2 DVD set so this is all that we're going to get of this show.  This show is about two middle aged adults with teenagers trying to raise them up while dealing with real life situations.  This isn't like the other television shows of this nature as this one takes on the issues dead on using dark comedy & takes on real life issues going on in today's society regarding teenagers & adults not only through real life but also through confessionals (ala ""Real World""), flashbacks, and flash-fowards.  From interracial dating & the race issues involved with it, cyber sex, drugs & alcohol, cosmetic surgery, teenage sex, punishing your kids, the male ego, homosexuality & more.  With Dave & Vicky being middleaged parents with their own adult problems along with their kids in Larry who's parents think he's gay & his best friend/neighbor Kenny who actually is gay with a crush on Larry; Hillary the typical sexy teenage daughter who's more into dating than school; Mike is the youngest who's about video games & hormones whenever he's not trying to hustle/blackmail his dad;...it's just got the formula for a good comedy & this show is just that.  With DVD extras being deleted scenes & confessionals from the cast & crew (right in the same humor as the actual episodes)...I recommend to pick this up as this is probably the last trace of this underrated TV show that you'll see.",1216512000,28,1648,4.788732394366197
2747320,5,B000MTEFVE,I Love this show.  My husband and I would practically fall off the couch laughing when we watched this show.  We would consider this one of the best shows we have ever watched.  It is so true to life and very realistic.  We were confused as to why Fox would cancel this show and keep all the other crappy shows on air that no one watched.  What a huge mistake.

2747337,5,B000MTEFVE,"If you really have to watch a sitcom... it should be this one. It's hillariously funny, realistic, not always ( so boringly) politcally correct, has a great cast, a great lead in Michael Rapaport (one of the most underrated actors ever). Normally I'm more into shows like Galactica, Lost or Heroes... but this one really rocks!",1180224000,2,327,4.857142857142857
2747338,5,B000MTEFVE,"Need your do for a humorous, fun-loving sitcom? If so, The War at Home is the show you should be watching! The War at Home (Fox, Sundays, 6:00) tells the story of a mother and father that have no idea to raise their three kids. This is currently the most rapidly growing sitcom on TV with its unique characters, well thought writing, and outstanding plotline.

  The plotline of The War at Home is ""Parents struggle to raise their teens"".

They have no problem expressing that! The War at Home stars Michael Rappaport as Dave Gold, a working yet very lazy father. His wife, Vicky Gold (Anita Barone) is the neighborhood ""hot mom"". Together, they have three kids. Sixteen year old, Hilary (Kaylee DeFer) is just emerging into the dating scene, Larry (Kyle Sullivan) doesn't exactly sit at the ""cool table"" in the lunchroom, and last thirteen year old Mike (Dean Collins) is all hormones and video games. All together the make up an extraordinary cast.

  The writing of The War at Home is the best that I have ever seen in a sitcom. The writers should be proud! In this sitcom, everyone can express their personal feelings in their own confessional space. I think that this way is a great way for all of the characters to express what they feel on the inside, rather than what they pretend to be on the outside. The writers make each character so unique that you couldn't believe they are a family.

  Since all of the characters are so different, put together they make up a very dysfunctional family. It is humorous to see how all of the opposites get along in a TV show. From the first to the second season, all of the characters changed drastically. Dave quit his job and is planning on starting his own business. Though we all know that won't work out.  Hilary has become more mature, and became a lot more serious with her boyfriend. Dave and Vicky put Larry on depression pills thinking that he would open up and make more friends. Mike finally has a girlfriend though now he is barley one the show.

  The War at Home is a humorous heart-warming comedy that everyone should be watching! From its outstanding plotline, to its fun-loving characters, the war at home is the best show on TV! Fox would be wise to keep the show running as long as Malcolm in the Middle.",1178496000,3,2271,4.534313725490196

2747340,5,B000MTEFVE,"With 2 kids now in their 20s, I have pretty much lived this show in one form or the other.  Dave's dry humor and honesty are great.  Show's also not afraid to take on issues - teen homosexuality, daughter losing her virginity, etc.  Doesn't get overly serious (like Scrubs is starting to do), but gives us a serious insight into controversial issues, while making us laugh at the same time.",1176336000,15,390,4.542857142857143
2747341,5,B000MTEFVE,This is one of my favorite shows. We all talk about it at work the next day. It is hilareous!! I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD as I have already pre-ordered it.,1172188800,7,168,3.8285714285714287
2747342,1,B000MTEFVE,"This show is so stupid - hence, why it's been bumped to Thursday nights (can't compete with Simpsons, American Dad, and Family Guy!).  When are they going to release Boston Public on DVD???  That was a quality show.  Why didn't FOX take over the rights to ANGEL when the WB cancelled it a few years ago????",1171152000,9,306,4.428571428571429
