7835989,4,6303059872,"Following on from the hot success of Carry On Loving (1970), the gang retreated into another historical theme. The series always seemed to be at its finest when doing a period comedy and Carry On Henry (1970) ranks up there with some of the greats of the series such as Cleo (1964), Don't Lose Your Head (1966), Screaming (1966) and Up The Kyber (1968).
Fresh from having one of his wives beheaded (Patsy Rolands), King Henry (played brilliantly by Sid James, injecting his usual rogue-like characterisation into the role) immediatley marries Quen Marie (a superb comic turn from Joan Sims in what is possibly her most lengthy and amusing role in the series) but once they retreat to the bed chamber, Henry discovers that Marie continually stinks of garlic and she is not about to give it up for anyone. As Marie is sister to the King of France, Henry realises it won't be so easy to have this wife beheaded. He soon becomes besotted with Bettina (beautifully played by the bubbly Barbara Windsor who said that this was her favourite Carry On) and soon plots to get rid of his French Queen.
This Carry On film stands very well and Talbot Rothwells dialogue races along, sparkling with witty repartee and fast, furious one-liners. Sid James, Joan Sims and Barbara Windsor are easily the best players here, though Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey camp it up to the end and are consistently amusing in doing so. Also popping up are Terry Scott as Cardinal Wolsey and Kenneth Connor as Lord Hampton of Wick. The location filming and grand, elaborate sets are authentic and Eric Rogers music is masterful. Possibly the best 1970's Carry On film.",1036022400,,1644,4.771929824561403
