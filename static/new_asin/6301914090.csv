378390,4,6301914090,This is a fun movie for the Nascar fan. Action pack. A great movie to watch while you wait for the Nascar season to begin.,918086400,,122,3.92
378391,5,6301914090,"Well all I have to say is Top Gun on wheels and that should be enough.  Anyone who likes Stock Car racing will notice the obviously un-race like action ""rubbin is racin"" is true to a point : ) but aerodynamics  plays a part also.  However folks this is a movie!!! And if you didn't like  it, check your pulse : )",913939200,,312,3.9838709677419355

378465,5,6301914090,"I just saw this On Demand Starz. It is truly an awesome movie. I love the action, the dangers involved that racers face every day yet love it just the same. Tom was at his best as per usual.

If you like his movies you will like this one.",1513900800,,238,3.857142857142857
378466,3,6301914090,"Pretty good movie, but not nearly as funny as the Will Ferrell version with the Ricky Bobby guy in it.  But it's still a great comedy.  Enjoy!",1511049600,,142,4.222222222222222

378468,5,6301914090,"this is just about the blu ray version as we all know what the movie is about.
the quality was really good, much better than the DVD version I have. the sounds quality was excellent as well.
I am not a picky videophile expert but trust me, this is worth the upgrade to blu ray version.",1508198400,,285,4.107142857142857

378541,3,6301914090,"As you expect, Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise. The acting in this movie is really good. I give it 3 stars because it is still an entertaining movie. However, the plot is just beyond bad. I don't want to give any spoilers but the plot is just not well written and it's like they started cramming everything together to save money and time. If they actually detailed everything out over a span of 2 hours or up to 3 hours, then this movie would have been really good.",1507507200,,459,4.2272727272727275
378542,5,6301914090,"Daytona Raceway is a site to behold in person.
If you have the guts, you can even take a ride in a race car (Richard Petty Experience) with a driver.
It is scary but it is probably an experience you will never forget.  Not for the faint hearted - no heart conditions.
Anyway, I had seen bits and pieces of this movie before.
I had to watch it through just to see how the drama was depicted and how the Daytona Beach raceway was featured.
Now days I think the in car cameras are very good.
The newer race cars have gone digital with sensors feeding back telemetrics to the engineers.
This move shows the analog guages, how the tuning was done more by the seat of the pants.",1507420800,,672,4.209302325581396

378544,1,6301914090,"This film is about the cheesiest film on the planet. I say this as someone who is normally a fan of 80s cheesiness; this film is too cheesy, hackneyed, and clich for even MY tastes. Just about the only way someone could enjoy this is if one is so into both Tom Cruise and NASCAR that one has fantasies about banging Cruise in the back of Jeff Gordon's car while it goes in circles for five-hundred miles. If you're considering watching this because you think it's a car movie, STOP NOW, and go watch some Fast and Furious films, instead.",1504828800,,537,4.38

378546,4,6301914090,Movie is always great to watch. Love to watch it on my PC. Tom Cruise as Tim Richmond and Rowdy Burns as Dale Earnhardt. I think the scene where Cruise and Burns meet with Big John a.k.a Big Bill France really happened between Earnhardt and Geoff Bodine.,1503705600,,254,4.425531914893617
378547,1,6301914090,"This one star rating is a reflection of the quality of the 2017 Blu Ray, not the movie itself. The movie is great for what it is, that will never change!

If you plan on watching this disk on anything better than TV speakers, do not waste your time. The video conversion is passable, the original movie was somewhat grainy and soft and that is presented in the BR dub.

The TrueHD 5.1 audio soundtrack on this disk is atrocious. The surround mix is very basic and front heavy but I suspect that is true to the original mix. Too bad as this movie calls for some ambiance and more car and crowd sounds coming from around you. The dialog was mixed way too quietly, you need to adjust it higher or you cannot make out what people are saying. The bass (LFE) mix is virtually non-existent. The audio was so flat in the movie that the movie trailer (the only extra on the disk) had more bass.

DO NOT waste your time with the 2017 version of the Blu Ray disk. I'm not sure if other versions of the movie have these same problems.",1503014400,,1022,4.230769230769231

378752,4,6301914090,"This review is for the February 7, 2017 Blu-ray release. So, okay, for some reason I love this movie. It's a guilty pleasure because it's not a great film by any stretch. But I love cars and Robert Duvall, who totally saves this film, so there it is. I have to comment on the blu-ray itself though. If you are expecting a high-def, non-grainy version of this movie, this isn't it. I don't think it looks any better than the basic DVD I used to have. I lent that one to a friend and never got it back so I didn't mind buying this as it was reasonably priced, but the picture quality is not that great (I have an upscaling 4K player and 4K TV). The Dolby 5.1 mix sounds good on the surround sound though, especially during the race scenes. So if you have this movie already and are wondering if this is an upgrade, it isn't. Keep your old copy and save your money. If you don't have it and enjoy 80's movies with every cliche in the book (okay, it's 1990 but still), then you'll like Days of Thunder. Get it and watch it over and over like I do.",1489363200,,1043,4.117647058823529

378845,3,6301914090,"I am not a big race car fan.  This is a fairly good racing movie though.  Probably my favorite one.  During the 60's and 70s stars like Steve McQueen, James Garner and Paul Newman who all just happened to race also.  Made movies and this is better then any of those,  Tom Cruise is involved in a crash and afterwards isn't as aggressive.  Robert Duvall is his head mechanic and tries to get him out of his funk.  I think this is the movie Tom Cruise met Nicole Kidman on.  I don't really know how realistic the racing scenes are.  I have some friends who are big NASCAR fans and they all say that there's no way all that bumping would be going on.  But still this is a good movie.",1486598400,,680,4.122137404580153

379221,5,6301914090,"This isn't a documentary film on NASCAR racing. Once you take that fact on board then the whole thing becomes a fun romp, with some well-orchestrated race car wrecks thrown in to liven things up. Robert Duvall carries the film, Tom Cruise can't act, and Nichole Kidman  could  easily carry the demands of her part while in her sleep. I don't knock it, however, as it is harmless, good-natured, fun and Robert Duvall never fails to produce the goods.

379270,3,6301914090,"Tom Cruise tries to do for NASCAR what he did for the military in ""Top Gun"". However, he just doesn't pull it off. He doesn't make it sexy. The story line here doesn't evoke emotion. It tries. But no luck. There isn't even the ""Oh I hope they get together"" either. They didn't develop the relationship between Kidman and Cruise. I think they had the opportunity to really show how NASCAR is a sport and how you have to really know driving, the track, cars etc to be good at it . . . that it isn't just luck on a tank of gas with tires still on. Dunno. Just seemed kinda slow. They did try to capture the culture of the circuit with the ""son of a *****"" every other word. That was true to the crowd. But that was about it. Maybe it was enough for the NASCAR fan. Who knows? Not for me. You do get to see a young, handsome, shaggy haired sun kissed Tom Cruise. Kidman was young and pretty too. But if you have watched ""Officer and a Gentleman"" or ""Top Gun"" you have seen the plot for this movie. Same stock plot.

Also from what I recall (maybe incorrectly) from watching NASCAR races (my father making me as he watched them and controlled the TV or forced to sit and watch when he dragged me to one of his friend's to watch a race) you don't go around the track slamming into cars etc. You get flagged and if enough rough housing you get kicked out. You definitely lose. Dunno. What I recall.

Overall not Tom's best.",1448150400,4,1416,4.164233576642336

379335,4,6301914090,"TOP GUN WITH CARS

I re watched Days of Thunder tonight. I like the movie. I really do. It's a bit of a caricature of NASCAR more than a realistic portrayal of it, but I'm totally fine with that. I don't care that Cole Trickle is the only driver or pit crew guy in the movie that isn't a southern bumpkin. I get what they are going for. I know it's not accurate but I don't care. It's an entertaining movie.

What bothers me about it is that it's Top Gun on wheels. Think about it.

Tom Cruise is the best of the best pilot / race car driver.

He gets the chance to fly / drive with the best pilots / race car drivers in the country.

He's a cocky jerk who thinks he knows it all and doesn't need to listen to the rules laid down by the wiser Viper / Harry Hogge

He proves he belongs flying / driving at this level after some rough early problems.

He meets a beautiful and far more mature combat flight instructor / doctor who's professional nature makes her want to keep Maverick / Cole Trickle at arms length. But he's so edgy that Charlie / Claire just can't resist and fall in love with him despite great risk to their professional reputations.

Then in a horrible crash he loses Goose / Rowdy Burns.

After that Maverick / Cole Trickle has trouble re-engaging. He gets back in the F-14 / Stock Car but is hesitant to push the envelope anymore.

Suddenly as he's flying / driving around in circles there's a crash. Other planes / cars are on fire. Smoke is everywhere. Maverick / Cole Trickle needs to focus right now and get his head back in the game.

He pulls it together, finds his nerve, and flies / drives right into the pack of enemy MiGs / other race cars. He comes out successful!

He's met on the deck of the carrier / in the pits by his flight crew / pit crew. Everyone cheers him!

And he and his former nemesis Ice Man / Rowdy Burns accept him as a great fighter pilot / race care driver.",1442448000,3,1907,4.149456521739131

379780,3,6301914090,"Days Of Thunder is all about auto racing. In it,we get to see producers try to capitalize on the image and persona of the characters that Tom Cruise has portrayed at this time of his career after the success in the box office brought about by films such as The Color Of Money,Cocktail most especially Top Gun. After having previous settings involving pool table rooms,bars and the Naval academy,this time we have the story at the race tracks with Cole Trickle as the protagonist.

The movie did not really excite me as I just watched nothing new after having seen the previous Tom Cruise films as we see another arrogant,highly confident and extremely talented profession this time a race driver playing the protagonist who once again engages in a romantic relationship with an attractive woman and falls under the guidance of another old mentor who teaches him lessons about life. So there was definitely nothing new and refreshing in this new Tom Cruise film and it was definitely cliched from beginning to end.

379947,2,6301914090,"This review is about and based solely upon the transfer of the film to Blu Ray and does not provide the 100th summary of the plot or my opinions on the movie's quality, acting or storyline.

VIDEO.
  I watched on a Panasonic ZT 65"" plasma and an Oppo 103 Blu Ray player. Do not think that this film has been remastered in any way.  It is rare that I actually see artifacts on a blu ray, even a bad one, but Days of Thunder does have them in the form of white dropouts.  Granted, I saw them only once around the 20th chapter and went back and confirmed them as well.  The imaging is not terrible but not great either. The film has a relatively soft focus with a smoothing out of small details.  It's not that you don't get used to seeing what your watching but this film was probably transcoded to Blu Ray from an old mother copy and was not cleaned up at all.  Deep blacks are not deep and the warm color grading is pretty lifeless.  Despite the dated soundtrack, I like the film but this transfer doesn't cut it.  Glad I bought it cheap at BB.  2 stars for the video.

AUDIO.
  You'd expect the audio on a film about car racing would be incredible but it isn't.  While the lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 soundtrack provided clean and transparent dialogue they could have done so much more for those who's home theaters are just waiting for a film like this.  Some good panning from and across the front and rear stages but no where near what the action in the film dictates.  While better than the video  imaging, a disappointment for me in the holding back of what should have been much discreet directionality from the surrounds.  Bottom end for the LFE channel gets some use but is not anywhere near as deep as it should be for those who have ever been around a race track.  3.5 stars on the audio

Extras.
  There are none, not even a commentary.  They do include the movie trailer but I hardly call that an extra.
All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the transfer to blu ray and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.

First thing gang... NASCAR HAS RULES!  Any driver or racing team condoning the deliberate rear-ending, sideswiping, or pushing a competitor's car into the wall would be banned for life!  FOR LIFE, absolutely and without question or appeal.

Secondly any driver that did any of the foregoing would be destroying his own car (not to mention his personal well being).  Does anyone out there know how much those dang machines cost?  Does anyone out there think that any car owner would put up with a driver that purposely wrecked his investment?

Thirdly, NASCAR races at speeds routinely approaching 200MPH... a car getting seriously out of shape resulting in air getting under it risks flipping about like a leaf in the wind... a very, very dangerous and potentially life ending event.  What driver is going to risk that possibility by running about smashing into other cars?  Well... I'll tell ya... NOT ONE, Nada, Zip, Zero.

This movie was made for one reason only... to cash in on the success of Top Gun, period.  Tony Scott should hide his little pointed head in shame and in perpetuity.

The only reason I gave this asinine movie one star is because you have to give it something in order to post a review and for Kidman... a lovely lady that is truly easy on the eyes.",1374192000,3,1527,4.670411985018727

I love most of the movies Tom Cruise has acted in, but this isn't one of them.  Personally it relies far to much on the racing personalities than on racing.  Understandably as although racing is great to watch live at the track, it isn't as good on TV or in movies.  Don't take my word for it, look at how other racing movies have done.

380421,4,6301914090,"My parents didn't let me see PG-13 movies when I was a tad.  A special exemption was made for Days of Thunder.  They knew their parenting priorities (besides, 8 is plenty old enough to learn how to drink and cuss).  It's hard to imagine in this day and age of sanitized racing, but once upon a time, NASCAR drivers would race a little bit and fight a little bit, race a little bit and fight a little bit.  Days of Thunder captures some of that spirit.

Cole Trickle is, inexplicably, a driver who knows nothing about cars.  He needs a gristled old crew chief, and nobody does gristled like Robert Duvall, to teach him.  Spoiler: ""loose"" means a car is running loose; ""tight"" means a car is running tight.

Cole Trickle is loosely based on the late, great, and controversial driver Tim Richmond.  Trickle's nemesis is Rowdy Burns.  Loosely based on Dale Earnhardt, he's the kind of guy who would saw his own hand off to get away if the zombies were coming.

Yes, many corners are cut, and it's not entirely realistic, but it's all in the name of drama.  Mello Yello as a fly-by-night sponsor, on the other hand, is completely believable.

The romance between Trickle and Dr. Lewicki doesn't work nearly as well as the friendship between Trickle and Rowdy.

I hate warm beer, cold women, and Russ Wheeler.

Highlights include a young Art Mullen, only a lowly state trooper before his meteoric rise to become a chief deputy in the U.S. Marshal Service.  I wouldn't have pegged him for a man that would let a girl get ornery (I mean, real ornery) with a man he had pulled over.

FACT: Fred Thompson has, with one sole exception, outshined the real person upon which every character he has ever played.  That exception?  When Fred Thompson played Fred Thompson.

The real winner in Days of Thunder?  The Skoal Bandit.  A cameo is all Mr. September needs.

This review is of the 1999 DVD.  You are given the option of listening to the movie in ""Dolby Surround"" and ""5.1 Surround"" (and French).  Presumably this means Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround and Dolby Digital 5.1.  Inexplicably, the DVD defaults to 2.0.  The only DVD extra is the theatrical trailer.  The sound is good, not great.  Which is a shame; a NASCAR race is an incredible aural experience.",1328054400,,2246,4.601010101010101
380422,4,6301914090,"""Days of Thunder"" is a fast lane fictional NASCAR movie, with up-and-coming driver, Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise), trying to make a name for himself on the track. At first Trickle finds it tough going, and veteran Crew Chief Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) is able to provide some valuable guidance to help him win. Despite improved form there is no shortage of duels, which begins with Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), but this competitiveness leads to friendship, as backup driver Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes) wins races whilst Burns and Trickle recover from injury. Trickle also falls head over heels for his treating doctor Dr. Clair Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), and his desire to return to the track is stimulated by the challenge to dethrone the over confident Wheeler, which leads to an exciting finale.

380461,4,6301914090,"This movie basically demystified NASCAR racing for me. Quite a challenging sport. I was surprised that I actually  enjoyed the movie. The relationship between Harry and Cole changes from frustration to understanding. Basically Harry became a father figure type for Cole, in my eyes. The cop scene was hilarious. Nice comical input which carries out with the doctor (which, as Cole, I thought was the same girl). I hate how Cole(Tom Cruise) gets side swiped by Burns facing the opposite direction, and then flips back around with ease. Who does that? Then Cole got into a nightmare of a wreck with Burns. I couldn't believe he survived that. Or that any of them survived that. That car was wrecked. Totaled, especially on the driver's side. Incredible stunts. The wheelchair race scene was hilarious. Burns and Cole raced every chance they got. ""Male bonding"". The drag racing was quite thrilling. ...and then we take a long pause to have a look at Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's budding romance. The sponsor, Tim, becomes a douche bag. Cole and the replacement guy, Russ, have a spat on the track, which destroys both cars. Now Cole is faced with a decision leading to the final climax. We are invited into a touching scene where Cole convinces Harry to allow him to race the car again. Words are exchanged with a scuffle of ""male bonding"". This is reminiscent of my adolescence, when I would try to get the car keys, and convince my parents I was a responsible driver...minus the bonding. Everyone gets back into gear and get's ready for Daytona. Cole and Harry knew the right formula for a perfect victory. My question is: could driving like that really be pulled off in actual races? I'm not so sure. Wouldn't every race car driver strive for a perfect ending such as this?",1291075200,,1776,4.747572815533981

Early in his career, Mr. Cruise developed a cocky, in-your-face persona that he used in film after film.
He played the cocky unlikable fighter pilot, the cocky unlikable bartender, the cocky unlikable military prep-school student and the cocky unlikable pool hustler in movies that were limited by his character. Even in films that were saved by the superior performances of others - such as Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", or Paul Newman in ""The Color of Money""- Tom still played the cocky unlikable character.

With a handful of bizarre public appearances, he developed a nearly universal reputation, Sloane Crosley wrote in Village Voice, as ""one spoke behind Michael Jackson on the freak wheel.""

This is his cocky NASCAR driver movie.

Robert Duvall and Nicole Kidman make it tolerable, but if you're not a NASCAR fan, there must be something better you can do with 2 hours.",1288396800,2,1057,4.759562841530054

Even after several intervening years, the action still looks good and the story competent enough to hold your attention. There is nothing deep in the film - rookie driver, Tom Cruise, is brilliant but unpolished and needs the guidance of pit team boss Robert Duval to mould him into a race winner (with the inevitable on-off buddy relationship along the way). Then comes disaster with a serious crash (and the intervention of beautiful doctor and love-interest Nicole Kidman) before Cruise has a shot at the title. But will he be able to drive again after the trauma of the crash - erm...what do you think?. Along the way, there is a tough-guy rival who Cruise bonds with whilst having a road race; one of the best sequences in the film. You half expect Cruise to request a fly-by at the end of the film or, at least, shoot down a few Migs. Yes, it's a pretty mindless film but you knew that, right? As for the transfer to blu-ray, it was good but not overwhelming. Too much grain on clear blue skies. Same with the sound; it never really grabs you by the throat, even with all the cars screaming round the track. That said, it's an old film and the quality on blu-ray was far superior to my old DVD.

While the story maybe somewhat simple (or even hard to believe) I had always cherished the movie for its 'good vibrations' and the good mood it puts you in. Robert Duvall delivers an excellent performance as Cole Trickle's new-found father figure, the cat-and-mouse romantic tension between Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise is worth watching.
And last but not least,(my fellow countryman) Hans Zimmer delivers a score, I consider to be one of his best.

Though I started with a LaserDisc, I had always been disappointed with the original DVD release (not to mention the video authoring artefacts in the last part of the movie). The Blu-ray release - while not beeing a state-of-the-art BD - is a giant leap ahead and an invitation to experience, to re-discover the film again on Blu-ray.

380556,3,6301914090,"I've lived in the south since I was 9 years old and noticed immediately upon moving here that the locals have a fanatical love of NASCAR. I never really did connect with the sport though. But this is the south, and most folks here make it a point to watch NASCAR often. I remember watching Days of Thunder when it first came out on VHS and remember thinking that it was impressive on a Surround Sound setup, but I honestly didn't remember that much else about it, and that's largely because there's not much to it.

The movie, in a nutshell, chronicles the rise of up and coming rookie driver Cole Trickle, played by Tom Cruise. Cole just got bumped from his previous racing job due to some fiasco involving his father, and wants to eventually work his way up to Indy racing, and uses stock car racing as the best path to that goal. He enlists the help of Robert Duvall, a legendary crew chief who recently retired, to garner enough wins to proceed with his ultimate plans. The movie is something of a retread (pun intended) of Top Gun, as others have noted, in that the main character is a cocky, headstrong pilot of a vehicle who has a rivalry with a fellow pilot/driver (Michael Rooker in this case, Iceman in ""Top Gun""), suffers an accident (a big crash in this film, F-14 crash in ""Top Gun""), goes through a long period of doubt, but comes out on top in the end. And that's before you even get to the Kelly McGillis/Nicole Kidman parallels. Essentially this is a very formulaic movie plot in which the names and vehicles are changed around a bit but not much else. Thankfully they omitted the obligatory beach volleyball scene with Cole Trickle spiking Russ Wheeler in his big smug face.

The acting is pretty ho-hum. Cruise plays a straight out of the archtype handbook rendition of the youthful, brash, hot shot while Duvall covers the older, more sagely guiding force. I really like Robert Duvall and I think he stood head and shoulders above the others acting-wise. He brings a great deal of realism to the characters he portrays on screen and he nails this part perfectly to the point where you'd swear his character actually did build stock cars and manage pit crews for a living.

One of the most annoying aspects of the film are the names it gives to various drivers...""Cole Trickle"", ""Russ Wheeler"", and ""Rowdy Burns"", as prime examples. You can almost see the producers sitting around a conference table and trying to decide on a name that encompassed the evocative image of the typical Southern standout racecar driver. One can easily think of additional names they could have used that fit this formula: Hoss Firewall, Jackson Ridge, Jet Burleson, etc. There's the inclusion of real NASCAR drivers in the movie like ""King"" Richard Petty and others to help introduce realism into the movie, and here it somewhat succeeds. The races look real and one can imagine the rush it must be to hold vehicles together that are largely ginormous engines strapped to four wheels with a steering wheel attached while moving at 200+ miles per hour.

""Days of Thunder"" is basically a very mediocre movie with adequate acting and above average racing action. But it is just about the only modern Hollywood feature where you can take a glimpse into the fast paced life of the typical NASCAR driver. And for this reason you'll find it on a lot of NASCAR fans' DVD shelves. If you're interested in stock car racing (and a pre-botox Nicole Kidman) you'll likely enjoy the film.",1224892800,,3473,4.651465798045603

An almost fatal crash leaves Cruise and Rooker with career-altering decisions, and also time for Cruise to fall in love with future wife/ex-wife Nicole Kidman, whom he met on this movie.  A typical showdown ensues and the ending is appropriately fitting.  Cruise is in his 80s blustery let me show you I can act stage; Duvall and Kidman are very good; Randy Quaid, Cary Elwes and John C.

Cole immediatly tells his crew chief who just tell him that rubbins racin.

Here is where it gets bad when you start to watch it more than once then you notice that it is unbelievably un realistic. for example at darlington when Rowdy gets spun out and immediatly catches up to Cole would be inhumane. at the second Daytona he gets into a crashing match with Russ Wheeler in NASCAR if you crashed people half as much as that you would be in the garage getting your car repaired.

380613,3,6301914090,"Recently, Tom has played the same character in most of his films (I said MOST for anyone who dares to disagree with me), or has had more attention about his personal life from the press than his films.

I've always liked Tom's earlier films, although I did buy & like War Of The World. But I particularly like this & Far & Away as well, as Tom & Nicole made such a good on-screen couple, as well as off screen.

OK, the film does get a bit boring, and I did find myself doing other things during the car race scenes, as I've seen the film that many times before, I didn't need to watch them again. Wander away and make yourself a cup of tea during these scenes, except for the one with the car crash. Wow! They're okay to watch the first couple of times, but over & over? Nah.

While some others may disagree with me (hiya, you know who you are!), I love the score to this film. And since I'm a bit of a dizzy blonde at times, I rarely notice the scores to films, but this one I did. It adds more to the film, and always get me ready for the day ahead. Don't ask me why, but I was ready & raring to go to work after watching the start of this. Hans Zimmer also did the score to Rain Man, which is more of a mellow soundtrack.

A few reviewers have compared this movie or say it's a ""homage"" to Top Gun. I disagree. I hated Top Gun with such a passion, that I've only ever bothered watching it once, and never bothered getting it on DVD. The only good thing about Tom Cruise is the scene between him & the girl who has since disappeared off the face of the earth, with THE song playing in the background! ""Take My Breath Away"" wasn't it?

380616,3,6301914090,"In 1990, NASCAR was still a southern sport.  Feuds were downplayed, race coverage was still in its early days, and drivers respected one another.

Days of Thunder exploits the access they were given to NASCAR, and presents the sport in one of the lowest extremes possible.  Although some incidents are inspired by actual events (A similar event to the ice cream segment in the movie happened to former driver Benny Parsons in the late 1980s), the idea that drivers would smash into each other, and the pace car without reccourse is unrealistic for the time frame in which the movie was shot (although, I wouldn't be surprised to see such an occurance these days), and only enhanced the sports images as a ""redneck"" sport.

The movie does have its positive sides, such as cameos by Rusty Wallace and the late Neil Bonnett, as well as some driving done by actual NASCAR drivers (Greg Sacks, Bobby Hamilton, and Hut Stricklin).

Who ever heard a racecar driver tell an interviewer, ""If he comes near me, I'm gonna put him in the wall?"" I can't help but feel Tony Scott must think that people are complete idiots, and maybe they are, I don't know. Anyone with an IQ high enough to know that the WWE isn't real will probably be insulted by the cheesiness of this movie. With Robert Duvall, John C. McGinley, and even Cruise, who can be good, I thought they could've come up with a better story. It's a lot like Top Gun, I guess; the lives of real pilots and real Nascar drivers aren't as Hollywoodesque as their movie star counterparts portray them to be. The ""Talk to me Goose"" moments where Cruise can't get his head straight are way over the top. Maybe Duvall hadn't seen Top Gun yet and thought himself cruelly deceived afterwards when he did. He is a great actor, maybe Days of Thunder was just a payday? The demolition derby elements are also idiotic and totally far fetched.

That said, the movie, though it features lots of unrealistic driving (err, crashing) scenes and less-than-stunning acting, still isn't the worst way to spend a couple hours if you've got the racing bug.  As pointed out by other reviewers, Robert Duvall gives a great performance as Tom Cruise's crew chief who comes out of retirement to bring Cole Trickle (Cruise's character) to the top of the NASCAR ranks.  Cruise's own performance is sufficient, given the character, as is Randy Quaid's.  Nicole Kidman seemed to be trying too hard to be emotionless in this movie.  Maybe the writers/directors told her to, I don't know.  The racing scenes where the drivers aren't running each other into the wall are decent enough, and the car sounds are pretty good.

Where do I start?  How about with the script?  Now that that's taken care of how about the acting?  The acting was absolutely atrocious.  I believed that Tom Cruise was a Nascar driver for about a tenth of a nano-second.  He sounds nothing like a Nascar driver, he doesn't plug sponsors like crazy, and he sure as hell doesn't look tough and weathered from racing.  Nicole Kidman breaks out an unforgettable performance, but this movie did come after ""Far and Away"" so she had no where to go but up.  Robert Duvall is far from the days of Lt. Col. Kilgore and it really saddens me.  The man was such a hard ass in ""Apocolypse Now"" and now he loves the smell of pit fumes while eating Crunch bars while his flamboyant driver makes left turns all day.  Who can forget John C. Reilley in this one.  This was long before the days of ""Boogie Nights"" and Reed Rothchild.
The plot.  Um....let's see.  Nope....not here.
I'm tired of ranting about this movie.  This movie sucked.  Tony Scott sucks.  Top Gun sucked.  Tom Cruise sucks....most of the time (except for Minority Report and Jerry Maguire and Vanilla Sky).  Carey Elwes is just hilarious.  He tries to hide the British accent, but he just can't do it.

Tom Cruise plays reckless upstart Cole Trickle, a race car driver who has decided to make the jump from Outlaw and open wheel racing to stock car racing.  Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) is the former car builder and crew chief that used car salesman and new car owner Tim Daland (Randy Quaid) wants to bring on board to work with Trickle.  Trickle is as wild on the track as he is off, and all of the talent he definitely has seems wasted as he and Harry are almost completely incapable of communicating with one another.  Eventually, there's a breakthrough, and Cole wins a few races.  At the Firecracker 400 in Daytona, though, Cole is involved in a major wreck along with his nemesis Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker).  It is here that Nicole Kidman enters the picture as Cole's doctor Claire Lewicki.  Cole's recovery from the crash involves more than just physical healing, and there's a new, thoroughly sleazy upstart in the circuit whom Cole must now contend with.  There's an interesting yet unfulfilled subplot about Rowdy's injury and his way of dealing with it as well as a romantic theme that basically goes nowhere; clearly, the action on the track is what the filmmakers were banking on in terms of the movie's success.
NASCAR wasn't as big back in 1990 as it is now, but even then you didn't have to grow up in NASCAR country like I did to see how ridiculous most of the racing action in this film was.  Anyone with no knowledge whatsoever of stock car racing would get the impression from Days of Thunder that the whole point of driving is to wreck all the other cars.  These cars spend an inordinate amount of time crashing and banging each other as well as the wall, yet amazingly enough battered old wrecks easily catapult themselves back into the top five.  The damage these cars sustain would wreck the aerodynamics to such a degree that they couldn't keep up with the pace car in real life.  Even still, the scenes can prove a little exciting, especially the big finish back at the Daytona 500.
As a loyal fan of the late Dale Earnhart, this movie makes me feel a little weird because part of the storyline involves a driver being killed at the Daytona 500 the previous year.  It's also a little strange to watch Nicole Kidman, as she really didn't seem to offer very much on screen this early in her career.  Her Australian accent is more pronounced than it is today, and her hair was still all frizzy in the way that made me question why Tom Cruise was so attracted to her in the first place.  I think Tom and Nicole may have originally met on the set of this film (but I could be wrong about this), and oddly enough their onscreen relationship seems to have no spark of life whatsoever.  Days of Thunder isn't a bad movie at all, but it's nothing to scream about either.  I would offer a word of advice to future viewers of the film; you would do well not to watch the film alongside a NASCAR fan because he/she will likely get on your nerves explaining over and over again how unrealistic the racing scenes really are.",1057104000,5,3260,4.534129692832765
380648,3,6301914090,"Oh please...this story and the performances are truly so distracting from the speed scenes as to make one feel flattened by one of the cars. It is so macho/cheesy as to make one suffocate from the fumes. I suppose if taking place in the late night adolescent dreams of a kid in Green Bay, this is the equivalent of ecstasy...but in the future give us something more than the carefully bottled and packaged machismo-competition-sexy thing and I'll thrill to the races without wanting to race away from the screen.

Tim is recruiting his old partner-Chef Crew and Car Builder Harry Hogge (Oscar-Winner:Robert Duvall) to train, young ambitious race driver Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise)-who has the talent for and his burning need to win for his life on the race. When one race, Cole's has survived for a fiery crash, a young brillant doctor (Nicole Kidman), who saved his life. When Cole actually falls in love with the Doctor. Then he puts all his energy, heart and soul to prove himself that he's a winner.
Directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun, Enemy of the State, Spy Game) actually made a fun (If at times-slow moving) flick. From a story by Oscar-Winner:Robert Towne and Cruise. Towne wrote the screenplay, which he acutally avoid most the chichs but it's quite flawed because of Cruise's one-note performance. It's the Performances from the Supportive Cast and Action Race Sequences outshines Cruise's Role, which is actually a good thing. Duvall is Solid as Usual and also Micheal Rooker as One of Cruise's race buddies are the stand-outs in this. Cary Elwes, Fred Dalton Thompson and a young John C. Reilly are in small roles in this one. This was a Box-Office Hit in the Summer of 1990. This is not, one of Cruise's Best films but is one of the few Stand-Out films from Scott. Watch for the late:Don Simpson (which he also produced this film in a cameo). Panavision. Grade:B+.",1036022400,9,1495,4.688212927756654

I like the fact that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman act in this movie together, it gives them a very natural dynamic. Robert Duvall is a great Redneck and really acts like a ""Good 'ol Boy"".  But more than that, I love the fact that this movie is about the Winston Cup circut and gives a good look at the intensity and drama of the sport.  I also think it's cool how they always smear soot on Tom Cruise's face after he's been racing, I think it's supposed to mean that he drives so fast that that stuff catches on fire around him and, of course, he has to drive through it to be victorious!",999907200,,776,4.22972972972973

Although the intensity and action is there, you will NEVER see actual drivers 'rubbin' on a real racetrack. But please don't let my previous comments discourage you from watching this film. It is still one of my favorites in my video library. The story follows young open-wheel driver Cole Trickle(Tom Cruise) through his quest to become a Winston Cup legend. Owned by a local car dealer named Tim Daland(Randy Quaid) and having his pit ran by the legendary, and recently retired crew chief Harry Hogge(Robert Duvall).

380699,4,6301914090,"For this longtime Nascar Fan, many parts of the Days of Thunder movie was ridiculous.  There were many things that happened in this film that just doenst happen in the true sport of stock car racing.
Aside from these inaccuracies, Days of Thunder is a pretty entertaining film, with a likeable cast and just enough drama, action and humor to round it out nicely.
The DVD is far more enjoyable than the VHS version. The video is crisp, and the sound is phenomenal.  If you want to show off your new DVD player, play this movie for your friends, they will be amazed at how great it sounds.  When the engines are first fired up, your living room will explode with loud rumbling engines.  This is what DVD is meant for.
The DVD is lacking on extras.  It has scene selections and the movie trailer and thats about it, but the video and sound really make this DVD worth buying without needing all of those extras.
Bottomline, Days of Thunder is a good movie, and a better DVD!! Its well worth buying!

Cruise was good, Kidman was allright, Duvall was incredible, and all the rest of the cast that's in there were outstanding. The crashes were done well, and the action's defenently included. It may not be realistic, but I defenently enjoyed it. And it does display that there is more to Nascar then the redneck side of it.
The DVD part of this, however, is not too cool. The only thing i'll give it a positive nod for is the Sound, which the 5.1 track displays beautifully. The Video transfer is not too peachy, with distortion being frequent. The major let-down is the lack of extras. The only thing in that department is a trailer, which is allways nice, but where's the making of feature, or commentary? At least some production notes? Cast interviews? Come on Paramount, give us at least something. But like I said, it's still worth the purchase just for the movie.",970704000,2,951,4.534883720930233

Nicole Kidman does little  else than stand around and look pretty.  Tom Cruise plays the cocky loner  again, and does little besides yell ""Son of a *****!"" during the  racing scenes.  Robert Duvall turns in another good performance, and the  race scenes are fairly tense and action-packed.  Film's biggest weakness is  its director, Tony Scott, quite possibly the phoniest of them all.  He  tries to make the film look slick, but instead it mostly looks sloppy.  Scott has the attention span of a 2-year-old child, and he obviously thinks  the same of the viewers.  Scenes typically last no longer than 2-3 seconds  (if you want an even worse headache, check out Scott's 1998 travesty,  ""Enemy of the State,"" starring the worst actor alive, Will  Smith).
