8031265,5,B0002SDZHK,"Please read my review for ""Assembly, Tuning and Positioning"" from the series Fun To Know.  I own both Learning to Play Drums and the former.

Both are excellent dvd's and I recommend purchasing them as your drums are being delivered. Refer to them fairly often
because there is so much information that each time you watch it you'll keep adding to your knowledge base.

And make sure to have fun, but the fun comes from knowing your instrument, excellent technique and spending a lot of time playing.  The payoff is....your passport to a lot of exciting adventures.",1393804800,,565,4.793814432989691
8031266,5,B0002SDZHK,"I bought this for my grandson who is starting drums.  I am teaching him, but don't live close enough to see him more than once or twice a week.

This video did a great job of demonstrating the drum rudiments.  Also the web site is excellent.

A great vid to have for starting out, or for those that want to review/learn the rudiments.",1234396800,4,334,4.253968253968254
