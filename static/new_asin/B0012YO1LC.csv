8248226,3,B0012YO1LC,"Shinichi (Sonny) Chiba fans certainly ought to be singing BCI's praises, as they have released a great many of his films in the last couple of years. The two films in this set are particularly uncommon, and, compared to some others, are mediocre at best. SOUL OF BRUCE LEE is a real Frankenstein job, as it is a German print with a soundtrack that jumps back and forth. The English dialogue track sounds a bit muddy and switches at times to a sharper-sounding track for some of the fight scenes. The film itself is no great shakes, but features some pretty lively fights with Chiba and others. A Japanese-language print is also included. FIGHTING FIST is a Japanese-language print (with no onscreen title) which has some videotape artifacts, but is otherwise OK. This cops-vs-gangsters outing was directed by Chiba, who also plays a small role; most fans will be disappointed that he's not in the film to speak of, but FIGHTING FIST is not too bad. It does contain some graphic violence, and is a better production than SOUL, which generally seems like a typical cheesy kung-fu title with Chiba thrown into the mix. All things considered, I don't regret buying this, but don't expect Chiba classics here. I hope BCI releases a nice box set of the STREET FIGHTER films; although they are very common on budget DVDs, BCI would do it up right.",1217289600,3,1340,4.706382978723404
