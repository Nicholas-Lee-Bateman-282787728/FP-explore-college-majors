2613520,4,B000GI3RGK,"""Abominable"" , from IDT/Anchor Bay Entertainment, is the newest entry in the ""Sasquatch Horror"" genre and it is a good one; clever , inventive, and well crafted by first-time director Ryan Schifrin, the son of legendary (think theme from ""Mission, Impossible"", among countless others)

television and film composer Lalo Schifrin...who DOES the musical score for his offspring's debut effort. And some other Schifrins get involved in all these doings, as well, as you'll discover if you carefully scan the credits. This almost has a flavor of a Schifrin family effort.

In this case, nepotism works just fine, thank you, as ""Abominable"" is one of the best ""killer yeti on the loose"" fright flicks ever put before the public. It is scary, it is suspenseful, it is tense and frightening, and sometimes it is funny as hell. There are puns and homages all over the place here, and borrowings from iconic moments in other classic feature films. Remember Kong hauling up Fay Wray & Bruce Cabot on the liana vine as they tried to escape down the cliff from him? Well, turn the vine into a climbing rope and slip another blond into some repelling gear and you get a fair approximation of that 1933 visual. And Roy Scheider declaring that the shark hunters need ""a bigger boat"" in ""Jaws""? Well Matt McCoy thinks he needs ""a bigger knife"" here with Mr. Eat-Em-Up coming after him.

The story line itself is a smart composite of several movie plots. It is a bit like you put the old 1970s Clint Walker/Bo Svenson t.v. movie ""Snow Beast"" through a cinematic blender with ""Rear Window"" (more the Christopher Reeve version than Hitchcock's original), the classic blind-lady-versus-hired-killers Audrey Hepburn vehicle ""Wait Until Dark"" , and, as the director himself points out in a very good little ""making of..."" short, of the well known original ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""Horror at 20,000 Feet"", the one with William Shatner trying to make people believe him when he tries to tell them about the gremlin he's spotted out on the plane's wing.

This story has Matt McCoy playing one Preston Rogers, a rich man who...until six months ago...was an avid mountain/rock climber, along with his wife. Then one day that all ended when a safety line broke and the two of them fell off a rock face. The wife was killed and Preston broke the small of his back. He is now a paraplegic; paralysed from the waist down. He has come home from the hospital to try and acclimate himself to living in his mountain house with its high, steep steps and wrap-around upper deck. Accompanying him for this ""trial run"" is an overbearing, obnoxious, patronizing jerk of a male nurse named Otis (Christien Tinsley) who is largely dismissive of anything Preston has to say.

Across the way from Preston's chalet (this road is a cul-de-sac that winds uphill from the main county road) is another house , this one basically a summer vacation home that is usually unoccuppied.

Today it is NOT unoccuppied , as an SUV of giggly girls pulls up (one's relative owns the house) and they begin to unload for a getaway weekend.

Bad idea, chicklets. You'll NEVER guess what's on somebody's supper menu!!

So the stage is set for a night of terror.

Other plot elements involve :(One) an attack on a local farm where a 1,200 lb. quarter horse is killed and a couple terrorized inside their own home by something huge that leaves massive humanlike footprints outside in the dirt (this is a straight-up tip of the hat to Charles Pierce's ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" and some of Pierce's ""night seige"" segments from that film), and, (Two) a night-time hunting party sequence whereby Lance Henriksen, Jeffrey Coombs, and Rex Linn go ""booger hunting"" and end up wishing they never had.

Some amusing elements to the story center around the county sheriff, played by Paul Gleason shortly before his untimely death; a man who has no use whatsover for ""monster stories"". It is around Gleason's character, and the town he serves, that a bit of an inside joke is constructed. Why screenwriter Ryan Schifrin chose to do this, I don't know, but he named the fictional town where...nearby...the bulk of our story takes place. FLATWOODS. And the creature being spotted and reported by the locals has been dubbed ""The Flatwoods Monster"" (...and Gleason's character adamantly doesn't ""believe in no Flatwoods Monster""!). Well, if any viewer is not familiar with that term they can Google it and get themselves an education. In the early 1950s, some UFO sightings around the town of Flatwoods, West Virginia , resulted in some citizens encountering a terrifying ""something""...like a robot-looking monster...on a ridge just out of town. A similar something was also seen an a back road by some motorists soon after. This ""robot-monster"" incident came to be known in UFO/paranormal circles as ""The Flatwoods Monster"" and is well known to this day (the real town even has a festival centered on every year, just like Point Pleasant observes its ""Mothman"" anniversary). Young Schifrin has opted to put his tongue in his cheek here and play with the Flatwoods legend, but I'm not exactly sure why...unless he is playfully hinting that maybe sasquatch comes from outer space.

One last element of interest here is the LOOK of Schifrin's ""booger"". It generally passes muster as a Squatch, a yeti, a bigfoot, or whatever...from the neck down. Eyewitness encounters over many years have described a real (yes, I think so) Squatch as looking like a facial cross between a human and a gorilla (and NOT like a human and an orangutan, as in the case of ""Harry Henderson""). Well, THIS critter here doesn't look anything like EITHER of those descriptions. It looks like some kind of god-awful take-off on something you'd have seen in old EC Comics (like ""Tales From the Crypt"") back in the fifties, or, as one reviewer here has so shrewdly observed, like an exaggerated caricature of JACK ELAM! It is almost all jagged teeth, but...there is something about the eyes, eyelids, and set of the nose that DOES make you think of Jack Elam

(could this be an homage to ""Creature From Black Lake""?).

That Schifrin KNOWS that the Squatch SHOULD be much more apelike facially is proved by the fact that he sits for his ""special features"" director's interview with a ZINJANTHROPUS skull reconstruction on a table beside him, which says something because many anthro types believe the Zinjan skull is very similar to what a GIGANTOPITHECUS skull should look like, and a prevailing school of cryptozoological thought holds that a squatch

may well BE a gigantopithecus variant. Also of interest is that the same skull in Schifrin's interview is shown on the floor of the Squatch cave in the movie as Lance Henriksen is shining his flashlight around.

All this focus drawn to this zinjanthropus skull and yet the depicted killer creature in the flick bears this no resemblance whatsoever.

Odd...but of no real ultimate import. The movie stands or falls on its own telling of its story and in that it does a great job. Kudos to Ryan Schifrin for a good first time out of the gate. Keep it up, Kid, and you'll be a star!

""Abominable"" is anything BUT that, and I recommend it highly.",1160265600,6,7187,4.849102773246329

2613522,1,B000GI3RGK,"This review is for the unrated version shown at a recent horror movie convention.  It was good to see Lance Henriksen and Jeffrey Combs working together and obviously enjoying themselves, but I would advise you to run screaming the other way from anyone suggesting this is a good movie.  The ending is stupid, the scares don't work (how in the world did this movie scare anyone?), and the whole `Rear Window' feel came off cheap and stupid.  I don't fault a movie for working with a low budget, in fact, some of my more favorite movies like `A Chronicle of Corpses' and `Ginger Snaps' had shoestring budgets and still came out with intelligent and frightening movies.  The writers of this movie had a lot of talent to work with and they chose to squander it and make a slasher movie starring a Bigfoot as the maniac.  In this case, showing the monster was a huge mistake.  It would have been more effective if the audience only saw the tracks, hair, and shadows of the creature.  The Bigfoot looked bad, I mean really bad.  Save your money, this is not scary and it's definitely not worth seeing.",1159747200,4,1096,4.5561224489795915
2613523,4,B000GI3RGK,"I actually saw this film in the theater and was just graphic enough to be funny and entertaining. I will own this movie when it comes out. I can't imagine the edited sci-fi channel version of this being near as good as the hard ""R"" I saw in the theater. This is one of my favorites of the year and I had high expectations going into this since I drove 300+ miles to see it.",1156204800,6,373,3.986666666666667

I was so scared and excited that I almost supplexed the yeti living next to us. The only thing is that our neighbor is a benevolent yetti and usually lets us borrow stuff so i decided against harming him. But I have to give a thumbs up to the party involved in making this movie. It is by far, the greatest sasquatch movie I have seen, and I hope there is a sequel, I also hope to buy it if it comes out on DVD. The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because I currently do not have the movie in my possession.",1153267200,5,683,3.920863309352518
2613525,3,B000GI3RGK,Its not the best movie but its not the worst.  it came on sci fi one night.  and it makes bigfoot totally opposite than what he/she really is.. juss watch it for yourself.  but they couldve made the movie a little bit better..,1152662400,,226,4.209302325581396
2613539,3,B000GI3RGK,It's not intended to be a bad movie. However... It's a stupid movie but it makes me giggle. The Yeti looks like a celebrity I won't dare mention here. If you mute it and make your own voices its even funnier. I think this is the real purpose of B-rated movies!,1449360000,,260,4.117647058823529
2613540,5,B000GI3RGK,"Wow! I saw thgis movie when I was a kid on the Sci-Fi channel (now Sy-Fy) and it was just awesome. Stumbling on its picture I remembered how much I loved it. Now that I'm a decade older and have about 200 movies in my collection I appreciate this film so much more! This movie is truly 5 stars, want to know why?

Why this movie is 5 stars
1) Starts the creeps immediately
2) Has plot, reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's Birds but still not like it for those who don't like Hitchcock
3) Cliche enough to laugh at as creature feature lovers like me want but has great twists
4) Matt McCoy slams this movie with expression, drawing you in
5) And most importantly, a yeti bites a dude's face in half. Enough said.

The movie is suspenseful,  expressive, and gorey in all the proportions. It's not mindless but not thought provoking. This is creature feature as it was meant to be. You must see it to believe it.

Best monster mash style movie in years",1449273600,,947,4.333333333333333

2613560,5,B000GI3RGK,"I purchased this movie elsewhere for a little less than a third of what Amazon charged for it.  Although I have watched this movie on the SyFy network a few times, I knew that this was one movie I wanted as part of my dvd collection.  This movie is like a lot of my favorite ""creature on the loose"" stories from the 70s & 80s--a good, old-fashioned, no-nonsense monster movie with elements of the
Hitchcock classic ""Rear Window.""  I loved that Ryan Schifrin made a movie using practical FX instead of going the ""all CGI"" route.  I also enjoyed that the sasquatch  looked like a hybrid of Jack Elam and a Jack Kirby character (think Blastaar, Ulik, or Kalibak) instead of a ""Harry And The Hendersons"" clone.  This sasquatch looked a lot less like gorilla or neanderthal and much more like the ""missing link"" or wild man and was effectively portrayed as an intelligent, relentless predator.  Yes, there are some predictable elements in this movie, but all movies of this type do tend to be derivative to various degrees.  Still, this movie is a great antidote to the tired, worn out zombie, demon, and slasher flicks that tend to oversaturate the horror genre.  All the actors  turn in fine performances and enhance the overall story and mood.  This movie is proof positive that solid, effective movies don't need astronomical budgets, overpaid ""A""-list actors, or a dizzying amount of CGI to tell a good story.  If you're like me and you enjoy old school monster movies, this is definitely a worthy addition to your library.",1420761600,,1523,4.7272727272727275

The main character, Preston Rodgers could not get anyone to believe him, even after power poles were knocked down, blood and entrails were smeared everywhere and homes & automobiles were ripped apart. The Sheriff who finally shows up at the end can only say ""all there is out here is pine cones . . .""

Give me a break! Yes, the acting was loathsome, the music was just plain wrong, the dialog was purely stupid, there was gratuitous nudity and gore aplenty, but the main problem with this movie was that the characters' actions and motivations were never true to what anyone, including those characters would have done in that situation - not once; not ever.

I have not seen all the other ""Big-Foot"" movies that other people compare this one to so I don't know if it is really better than those, but after reading all the glowing reviews here I feel like Preston Rodgers. Will anyone believe me when I try to warn them?

The storyline is weak and the monster himself is pretty fake. I know guys with facial features like this beast. The first thing deceptive about ""Abominable"" is the title itself. One imagines a YETI in Nepal or some remote village in snowcapped Asia, but we get a monster somehwere in Americas pine backwoods smarter than his victims. The teen females are sexy and there is a shower scene with the creature as a peeping tom. The hero of the story is a wheelchair bound Matt McCoy suffering from the loss of his wife during a rockclimbing trip and prescribed by his doctor to return to this lavish two-story cabin to heal and retreat. McCoy carries the film and is the only person that reacts to the situation(s) in a logical and believeable way, but there are notable cameos with thriller veterans Dee Wallace Stone (The Howling-1981); Lance Henrickson (of 1988's Pumpkinhead fame) and Paul Gleason (The Breakfast Club-1985) as the useless, doubtful law enforcement. There is a balance of idiocy along with enough creepiness that one might not want to watch alone while staying in a cabin in the woods, but then again, its tempting.

2613597,5,B000GI3RGK,"Abominable represents a fine return to genre for horror films. In an era where too many horror movies are Jason Voorhees slasher types or overly-CGI infested crapfests without the slightest originality or aptness of execution, Abominable, directed by famed composer Lalo Schifrin's son Ryan, stands out.

A man named Preston Rogers is being brought back home to the town of Flatwoods after months of rehabilitative therapy following a climbing accident at the infamous Suicide Rock, an incident which killed his wife and has forever cost Preston the use of his legs; he is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair. When his male nurse Otis leaves to run to the grocery store, a bored Preston decides to do some birdwatching with his binoculars when some college girls - Amanda, C.J., Karen, Tracy and Michelle - drive up to occupy the rented cabin across the road for the weekend.

With little else to do that doesn't remind him of his wife, Preston alternates between watching the girls and watching the woods. And when Karen wanders off to call her boyfriend on her cell phone away from the others, Preston sees, out of the corner of his eye, something big and hairy swoop in and snatch her, and by the time he brings the binoculars up again, Karen is gone leaving only her phone behind. He comes to suspect that the legendary Bigfoot is encroaching upon Flatwoods, looking for food. And humans are might tasty.

Abominable is not a groundbreaking film by any means, and the effects aren't that great (the monster costume makes the Yeti look like what someone aptly described as ""an angry Brian Dennehy""), but it is well-directed and has some really wonderful suspenseful moments, making excellent use of the claustrophobia of Preston's house and the deep, impenetrable darkness of the woods without.

Scenes such as the one at the beginning where the farmer and his wife hide in their house while something big, unseen and nasty skulks around outside is the stuff of nightmares, and Preston's reaction to his first glimpse of the monster, which is to freeze up and slowly start wheeling his chair back inside the house (no easy task given how his arms are locked up with terror) is also really great. As for gore, well, just you wait 'till you see what happens to Otis!

Through and through, Abominable an excellent little horror movie.",1313280000,2,2337,4.847117794486215
2613598,4,B000GI3RGK,"I really liked ""Abominable"", it was a perfect creature feature.

 The basic storyline is that a former resident is returning to his home after a horrible mountain climbing accident that killed his wife, and has left him in a wheelchair. Just as he and his male nurse are getting settled into his home, a car full of young women on a bachelorettes weekend getaway move into the house next door. Unfortunately another resident seems to have moved into the area as well, a big old hairy bigfoot monster that has a taste for human flesh.

With some great horror movie icons in extended cameos (Dee Wallace Stone, Lance Henriksen, Jeffrey Combs), and some above average special effects ""Abominable"" is sure to please horror movie fans. The movie does a great job of keeping the suspense racked up, and actually giving us protagonists that we are cheering for. I loved the sense of isolation found in ""Abominable"" as well.

If you are a fan of monster movies, then be sure to at least give ""Abominable"" a try. This one is definately going into regular rotation next to ""Tremors"", ""The Host"" and ""Slither"".",1307923200,,1099,4.738219895287958
2613609,4,B000GI3RGK,"Before you think this is a ringing endorsement, please note that this is a selective movie with a specific fanbase. If it doesn't look like you would like it, you are probably not in the fanbase I mentioned. You would know it if you are. This is a lower budget laughtrack with a Bigfoot stalking helpless females. Everything unsaid in that applies, and that is part of the charm here. now, to the review for a 3.6 movie i rounded up to a 4 on the B-movie ""I need something to watch and I want a horror movie - sorta"" stage:

Losing someone can sometimes fray the mind, causing us to see horrid things. Finding ourselves hurt during that can damage us all-the-more, making a person suseptible to all sorts of ideas. Still, when you notice a house full of attractive females and then think you see a huge man/beast taking them out one-by-one, even you start to think you've lost it.and that is the problem our main character experiences here, in the middle of some great wide nothing. Apparently his therapist thought he should confront loss with all his mental doors wide open, and apparently the people that watch him are not the nicest people in the world. Neglect, needles, not allowing one to use the phone - that is here and more. Plus Mr. Combs makes an appearance as a local, spicing up this marriage of B-movie cruelty and laughs.

I'm not sure how funny this movie was supposed to be at first, but some of it is rather funny. It is also a graphiv depiction of a Bigfoot gone wild, and I like that because those Big feet are not the only thing that the beast has in girth. He also has big fingers and big toes (keep your mind clean!), and that makes killing all-the-more fun.

While this was one of the Sci-Fi channel's wide array of shows, I have to say I liked it. i know it is cheap and i know it is not a mainstreamed item, but that is obvious. You can see it in the cover and in the way it is advertised AND in the way it comes out. Still, it has some charm to it and it has some fun in it and i like that. Movies like this, done correctly, remind me of the horror onslaught that came with the 80s/90s and that produced some grand movies. They were fun and wer enot widely accepted but, looking back, they gave you exactly what you were watching them for.

The Combs cameo is funny and i tohught I would mention it because I always liked him popping up in films. Much like anyone else with their own card to enter and exit horror movies at will, combs is one of those figures. He was a part of some great stuff and he does a great job acting here. Matt Mccoy also does a great job considering he is confined to a wheelchair and considering he has to be drugged or rushed or fearful almost all the time. And some of the deaths are above the normal.",1292889600,,2759,4.239543726235741
2613610,5,B000GI3RGK,"this movie was awesome, not many horror movies can scare me but this one gave me the creeps. this movie is awesome the specail effects were great. And bigfoot looked awesome.",1291507200,,174,4.645161290322581
2613611,4,B000GI3RGK,"I recall when this movie first hit the Sci-Fi Channel...I was expecting yet another `monster-of-the-week' flick with substandard CGI effects, bad acting, and the token `name' actor whose career is floundering.  I passed it by, relegating it to a ""Rock Monster"" or ""Ogre"" status, figuring I had missed nothing.

I can't remember if it was on ""Chiller"" or some other cable channel I was surfing the other night when I caught it just coming on...there wasn't anything else to watch, so I figured ""why not?""

OK, us horror folks spend a lot of our time watching dreck, hoping against hope that on occasion, one punches through the gloom and turns out to be a genuinely inspired horror film...and I have to cast my vote for ""Abominable"" in this case.  I quickly jumped on here to see if I could find it on DVD, and was thrilled to order it.

First time director Ryan Schifrin took a hundred thousand dollar budget and made a film that looked like two million, easy.  Obviously a project made with passion for the genre, the production values, acting, sound and cinematography were in a class that denied the lack of funds for this indie outing.  You have a who's who of horror here:  Neal Fredericks (The Blair Witch Project, among others) as the director of photography, a cast that includes Dee Wallace, Lance Henricksen, Paul Gleason, Jeffrey Combs, and one of my faves, Tiffany Shepis.  The story is well-written and paced superbly, combining elements of Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", and a dose of ""Alien"".  The effects are inspired for the budget, and surprisingly gory in the uncut, theatrical version, and I thought the ""Sasquatch"" was convincing (although I agree with someone else's opinion that it looked a little like the old character actor Jack Elam, but hey, I thought HE was pretty creepy looking anyways).  Heck, the sound editing was even done at Skywalker Sound, and the film's poster was done by none other than Drew Struzan...a pretty impressive pedigree for a little independent film, and a sure sign that at times, all the stars align, and a diamond is formed from the coal that surrounds it.

The disc contains a great behind the scenes feature that goes into depth about Schifrin's love for the genre, including some great interviews and backstage glimpses...and the commentary is well-done and informative.

 The total package is a good old-fashioned monster movie done right and delivering the goods.  Fans of suspenseful horror, gory monster flicks, and just a good time in front of the screen should definitely check this one out.",1289347200,2,2551,4.886310904872389
2613612,2,B000GI3RGK,"Written and directed by Ryan Schifrin, Abominable (2006) is a monster flick, with a streak of Hitchcock's Rear Window running down its middle, as a mysterious hairy creature emerges from the woods, to terrorize the inhabitants of a wilderness community.  The result is semi-entertaining, but pretentiously B-movie fare.

Preston Rogers (Matt McCoy) is recovering from a climbing accident that cost him the use of his legs, and took the life of his wife.  He returns to his home in the woods in a wheelchair, accompanied by his nurse Otis (Christien Tinsley), as five young women arrive at the house next door for a vacation stay.  Rogers thinks he saw something come out of the woods, and snatch one of the girls, but Otis doesn't believe him, and refuses to go next door and warn them.  An agitated Rogers continues to watch his neighbors through his binoculars.  The phone lines are down, and cell phone service is spotty, so he tries to communicate with his neighbors and the police via computer, but no one takes his warnings seriously, until the monster enters the house next door and starts slaughtering the girls.  Rogers manages to warn one of them, Amanda (Haley Joel), and she takes refuge in his home.  They are safe for the moment, but it will only be a matter of time before the monster strikes.

The film attempts to build up a sense of helplessness and frustration, as Rogers is unable to convince anyone that there is real danger.  It kind of works, but what is more frustrating is the silly plot, and how contrived the situation is.  Rogers is kind of annoying, and overdramatic, and completely ineffective warning anyone until he finally makes the genius move of just yelling at the people in the house next door.

Despite the warning, the monster tears through the house slaying Amanda's friends.  A man in a wheelchair would have no chance against a raging beast, but the creature is apparently a bit tired, and is practically moving in slow motion when he finally breaks into Rogers' home.  In the middle of the crisis, in a whispering voice, Preston recounts the story of his tragic accident, and assures Amanda that life is wonderful, and they will somehow defeat the monster.  A few minutes later, helpless on his back with Amanda attached to a rope, and the creature at the other end, it will take more than a little life affirmation to come out alive.  Somehow the resourceful Rogers, manages to find a way to survive.

The creature is mostly under wraps, and the heavy duty action is rather limited until the end, but Abominable still manages to provide a few exciting moments, including a bone crunching demise for Otis.  Preston Rogers is kind of weird and a little creepy too, in that he can't seem to keep his hands off of Amanda.  His overdramatic behavior, and frightened wide-eyed stares are not quite Don Knotts, but are way overdone.  Save for Haley Joel, the rest of the cast, including Lance Hendrikson (Millennium) and Rex Linn (CSI: Miami) are just fodder for a kind of average looking hairy monster.",1284163200,2,3040,4.7542857142857144
2613613,3,B000GI3RGK,"Abominable rips off Rear Window.  This isn't astonishing in itself - Mimic 3 and Disturbia being two recent examples - but that a monster movie could actually be about anything other than Jurassic Park, Predator, and Jaws is truly revolutionary.

Preston Rogers (Matt McCoy, a more handsome Mr. Rogers-style presence) has been confined to a wheelchair ever since a mountain climbing accident took the life of his wife. Rogers has been traumatized for six months, and he returns with great reluctance to his home in the care of male nurse Otis Wilhelm (Christien Tinsley). That's an awful lot of back story for a typical monster movie, but then Abominable isn't typical.

But this is still a monster film, after all.  To accommodate the role of victims, Abominable provides sasquatch-fodder three hunters (Billy Hoss played by Rex Linn, Buddy played by Jeffrey Combs, and Ziegler Dane played by monster hunter Lane Henriksen) and five young ladies celebrating their friend's pending marriage. The hunters are there to stumble around in the dark, find the monster, and die.  The girls are there to strip, take showers, and die. And yet Rogers is the hero here, and he's going to have to work overtime from his wheelchair.

The writer and director (Ryan Schifrin) hems his protagonist in a variety of ways. Preston's obviously bound by his wheelchair, but he's also psychologically fragile, evidence that lazy Wilhelm takes for a case of the newly returned jitters. The girls don't trust the weird guy with binoculars next door, taking him for a peeping tom. The cabins are physically isolated, an attribute the sasquatch takes advantage of by severing outside lines. Even the sheriff is less inclined to believe Preston after the trauma of his wife's death.

And yet the characters act like real people would in a terrifying situation.  Preston repeatedly attempts to call the police, warn the girls, and convince his nurse.  The nurse, a scoundrel from the start, becomes a significant obstacle when he threatens to dope up Rogers to calm him down. And the girls quickly go from thinking Preston's crazy to running screaming in hysterics as they realize there's a giant hairy beast running amok in the house.

Every film about a sasquatch has a pretty basic challenge: the monster is fundamentally humanoid, so it can easily look like a guy in a rubber suit.  Humanoid monsters are just uglier slashers. Abominable gets around this by giving the sasquatch a horrifying, wide-eyed look to it.  Its powerful presence is bolstered by heavy footsteps and the terrible damage it inflicts on its victims, particularly in biting their faces off.  For the most part, Abominable succeeds in making the sasquatch truly abominable.

But too much screen time is a bad thing, for both the actors and the sasquatch.  Seeing it in action up close causes the beast to lose its mystique.  Final girl Amanda (Haley Joel) keeps applying bright lipstick even in the most dire situations. And at one point Rogers goes on for five minutes how he was meant to survive the mountain climbing accident so that he could save Amanda from a sasquatch.

Still, there's a lot to like about Abominable. The director obviously loves the monster genre but has great respect for Rear Window and he artfully interweaves the two movie styles. Schifrin knows to leave the big reveal of the monster to the end, to inflict horrifying violence in the last act, and when to break traditional horror tropes to toss the audience a curveball.  Not quite as good as Disturbia but certainly better than Mimic 3, Abominable stands head and shoulders above other Bigfoot movies.",1281484800,,3628,4.958745874587459

I have to say,  'ABOMINABLE' was a nice surprise!  Here's an updated Bigfoot flick I actually enjoyed.  Sure, its a bit on the cheesy side when it comes to seeing the creature itself (This Bigfoot reminds me of something I'd see off of a Ghoulies flick!), but besides that, there are some highly entertaining scenes all through this flick!  It does start off a little slow (about 20 to 25 minutes into), then quickly picks up with some bloody, house-smashing, head-stumping action!  However, like most Horror flicks, there are a few eye-rolling scenes.  All in all, the bigfoot, in my opinion, looks awesome and the film as a whole is pretty entertaining.

2613629,2,B000GI3RGK,"Abominable (Ryan Schifrin, 2006)

The best thing about Abominable is that you don't really need to ask anyone how it is; the title tells you all you need to know. Schifrin, son of one of the greatest film composers ever to tickle the ivories, tackles his first (and, to date, last) feature film; he is better-known for his comedy shorts, especially those with co-director Adam Green (The Tiffany Problem et al.). This is probably a good indication of why.

Preston (National Security's Matt McCoy) and his friend/caretaker Otis (special effects guy Christien Tinsley, who won a special Oscar for inventing Tinsley Transfers [look it up], in his first job in front of the camera) come back to Preston's house after, we understand, Preston has spent a good amount of time in the hospital. While it's not explicitly stated until much later, a scene at the beginning should clue you in to why. (I'll still avoid telling you in case it's a spoiler, however.) Preston is looking forward to being back in the peace and quiet of his secluded mountain home, but just after Otis heads off to town to get some forgotten supplies, a group of loud, obnoxious young women, celebrating the impending marriage of C. J. (Drake and Josh Go Hollywood's Karin Anna Cheung), one of their number. (The others are played by Haley Joel, recently of the film version of Tony 'n Tina's Wedding; Life Happens' Natalie Compagno; American Idol contestant Ashley Hartman; and the seemingly ubiquitous Tiffany Shepis, recently of Zombies! Zombies! Zombies!. Given those four resumes, guess which one is wearing a red shirt and gets called ""Ensign"".) Preston has been filled with a sense of unease ever since coming back, and that night, he gets validation when one of the girls, who has left the house in order to get better cell phone reception, is carried off by the local version of the Abominable Snowman. The rest of the movie consists of Preston trying to convince both the local police and the women across the street that everyone on the mountain, including him, is in grave danger.

Oh, survival horror is a well-worn genre indeed, and Schifrin (who also co-wrote the script with one James Morrison; IMDB says it's the guy from Top Gear, but I'm skeptical) never fails to travel the ruts in the road. Granted, I'm willing to watch anything with Tiffany Shepis in it, and I can now apply that to Karin Anna Cheung as well. When you add in cameos from Lance Henriksen, Jeffrey Combs, and Paul Gleeson (the principal from The Breakfast Club), I'm already sold, even when my kid tells me it's the worst movie ever. It's not that, but it's painfully predictable, boring, and for a movie containing an Oscar-winning special effects guy, the effects here are awful (they reminded me, in fact, of Ogre, which I reviewed recently). Some very beautiful ladies to be found here, some fun cameos, but the bulk of the movie is more like Cast Away, but without any of the actors having Wilson's personality. * ",1246060800,,2974,4.791423001949318
2613630,4,B000GI3RGK,"""Abominable"" is a Bigfoot flick released to Syfy in 2006 where Matt McCoy plays a paralyzed man who returns to his deep woods home six months after losing his wife in a climbing accident. He slowly becomes aware of a Bigfoot-type creature prowling the area and preying on the five college girls vacationing in the house next door. Unfortunately no one believes him when he attempts to get help and his house isn't wheelchair-friendly. Horror ensues.

McCoy is best known for his reappearing role in Seinfeld as Lloyd Braun, George's friend from high school who goes loony. He's a bit reminiscent of Anthony Perkins of the ""Psycho"" movies. The story combines the Bigfoot legend with Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" and ""Friday the 13th"" and works well as it's entertaining throughout.

Bigfoot as presented here is a 7-foot hulk of unadulterated horror. He exists for one reason only -- to terrorize, kill and devour people (and anything else). The film doesn't shoot for anything much deeper than this; it's a deep woods slasher/horror flick in the mold of ""Friday the 13th."" The main difference being that Bigfoot here doesn't need weapons like Jason, he's got his teeth and overwhelming brawn.

Aside from being consistently entertaining ""Abominable"" has good locations (Idylwild, California), good production values for a TV flick, Lance Henriksen in a small role and some cute girls, particularly Tiffany Shepis and Karin Anna Cheung. The former looks thoroughly uninteresting until she has a ""Whoa Momma"" shower scene. Moreover, Haley Joel has a striking face and is a quality female protagonist.

Unfortunately the film only plays it semi-serious as there are some campy aspects (unlike ""Sasquatch Hunters"" and ""Sasquatch Mountain,"" which take the subject totally seriously). Otis (the male nurse), the hillbilly with an oxygen tube, the cops and the closing scene with creature-eyes in the night all infect the film with a goofy we're-not-taking-this-completely-seriously vibe, not to mention the Jack Elam-like face of the monster, which is more goofy than horrifying.

Regardless, ""Abominable"" works well for what it is.

Runtime: 94 minutes.

2613631,3,B000GI3RGK,"Not many films that regularly appear on the SciFi Channel are worth a watch.  ABOMINABLE is the rare happy exception.  Much of the film is a Gothic nod to Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW.  Here Preston Rogers (Matt McCoy)is a man confined to a wheelchair due to a mountain climbing fall six months earlier that killed his wife.  While looking through his binoculars in a mountain resort in the woods of California, he sees a Sasquatch type Bigfoot stalk a trio of attractive young women, whom he knocks off one by one.  Once you get past the laughable premise of a hirsute fanged seven foot lumbering gorilloid, you can watch the film with more than passing interest.  First, there is Preston himself, a man who has to rely on his brain to survive.  In most horror films, there is a tendency for the audience to laugh at the foolish antics of a victim, who, when approaching the Big Thing, often says nothing more intelligent than, ""Is anyone there?"" Preston is plenty scared but he uses his fear to construct a plan for survival that is believable.  Then there are the Pretty Girls.  Hollywood monster flicks demand that at least one of them must be seen semi-nude in the shower, and this film obliges.  Lance Hendrickson has a bit part as a hunter who winds up as the hunted.  ABOMINABLE borrows from nearly every one of its genre in that the Big Thing picks off its screaming victims one by one.  But in this case, Preston can do more than passively accept a gruesome fate.  We can cheer his efforts to save himself and one of the Pretty Girls (Haley Joel).  The Big Thing himself is rather more dopey looking than scary.  Still, it is Preston in his wheelchair that draws the audience into a semblance of a willing suspension of disbelief. ABOMINABLE emerges as a successful fright film that is far superior to others that persist in presenting their victims as no more than willing and rather unintelligent and hence uninteresting cattle led to slaughter.",1233360000,,1952,4.650145772594752

2613635,3,B000GI3RGK,"The good things about this film:

1. The acting isn't bad. In fact it is quite good in some instances despite the sometimes campy dialogue(which thankfully doesn't plague too much of the film). Compare it to most other b-horror flicks and you'd be hard-pressed not to consider these actors for Oscars!

2. The whole ""something's out there"" feel that the film starts out with. It's what made ""Halloween"", ""Jaws"" and ""Alien"" almost unbearably suspenseful. The first 20 or so minutes of this movie were damn scary and it felt as if FINALLY a horror filmmaker was going to deliver the goods(the opening scene was absolutely terrifying).

3. Judging from the interviews the director seemed to have all the right influences from a horror movie standpoint. We were right on the same page when he spoke of what frightened him most in films he liked.

4. It was shot well. The locations and the camera work- fantastic! It really had that creepy, isolated feel. I almost heard the opening monologue from the tv show ""Tales From the Darkside"" going off in my head when they showed all the pretty scenery at the start.

The Bad:
1. They showed the monster too much. WAY too much. It was much more frightening when caught in brief glimpses. It was a scary looking thing when it wasn't moving. As soon as it moved it reminded me of something from Puf'n'stuff or Lidsville. The director should have taken a cue from ""Alien"" and just showed the beast in fleeting glimpses(the face in the window was a great scare, by the way).

2. Cop outs/cliches. Whenever a horror movie resorts to gratuitous gore, nudity or mounds of insects I yawn. It's almost a way of showing me that you don't feel that your work can stand on it's own merits so you have to throw in cheapo ""thrills"". Bad call. This film doesn't have the bugs, but the neck shredding scene was over the top, as was having the girl in the cave's lower torso torn open. The pound-the-chest-organs-fly-out scene, too. The face-bite scene would have worked so much better and had more shock value had we already not been dulled/desensitized by the earlier gore.

Nudity? Sure, the woman had a lovely figure. But I rented this movie to have my fight-or-flight feelings triggered, not my loins. Manipulative and unnecessary.

Another cheap filler that horror filmmakers like to resort to is things jumping out at you. A couple times is OK, but really, must we go so off the hook with it? Like when the guy opens the closet and something falls out....very cheap. Again, just stick to the story and stop trying to manipulate your audience so much!

I gave this film three stars because of the promise it showed. The director seems to have the right ""stuff"" to make something in the future that will be remembered. This movie was OK, but it could have been GREAT. If I had a few million I swear I'd take him, his crew and about three-quarters of his cast back up in the mountains to shoot another version. The potential for a truly frightening movie is there(just watch the first 20-30 minutes).

2613640,4,B000GI3RGK,"""Abominable"" is a welcome surprise - a well-made horror film that isn't too slick and doesn't devolve into a glorified episode of ""Goosebumps."" Matt McKoy delivers a very sympathetic portrayal of a Jimmy Stewart-like character who witnesses and tries to prevent a series of murders by a Bigfoot-like monster. There's some very good acting in here (courtesy of numerous B-listers you will recognize), decent dialogue, a well-stretched budget, mostly effective music and a surprising amount of old school gore. If you enjoyed the sort of effects Tom Savini is best known for, you will enjoy some of the more gruesome and bloody deaths splattered throughout this movie. Honestly, if you like gruesome and well-crafted horror, you will enjoy this movie.

The real mystery here is why on earth wasn't this given a theatrical release. It's far scarier - and better made - than the endless horror sequels and remakes we're asked to see.",1196035200,,929,5.071895424836601
2613641,3,B000GI3RGK,"The tag line is ""Some things are better left unfound."" This movie is not one of those fortunately. First time director Ryan Schifrin's film is one of the rare low budget horror films that has the ability not to insult your intelligence and keep you entertained at the same time.

The film is sort of a mixture  of Saturday morning creature feature mixed with Hitchcock's Rear Window and the combination is not at all bad. Newly paraplegic Preston Rogers (Matt McCoy) is taken by his nurse to a home in the mountains that had been the scene of his injury. While there he encounters a strange bigfoot like creature that is preying on his neighbors a cabin full of young women soon to celebrate a friends marriage. To say more would be to spoil the fun.

While this may not be great cinema it is fun and is worth checking out. Anchor Bay did a fine job on this release offering a making of featurette that is better than the usual fluff piece. A great commentary on low budget film making with Ryan Schifrin and actors Matt McCoy and Jeffrey Combs. Schifrin's USC student filn ""Shadows"" and the usual assortment of stills galleries.

You could do much worse than to check this out on a creepy night alone.",1195084800,,1202,4.5
2613642,4,B000GI3RGK,"I won't go over the movie, you can see that from most other reviews. I watched this movie accidentally on the Sci-Fi channel and was very surprised that I liked it. There was the mandatory women running around screaming, and a blurred out shower scene (hey, I watched it on TV) but the suspense was real.
Because of the lead characters inability to walk and could only watch in horror thru binoculars attempting to warn people of the creature, led to the suspense. The movie actually reminded me of Hithcocks ""Rear Window"".
The one thing that really worried me...and I must know...how can a person, who has been chased thru the woods by a monster, escaped death after falling from a rope, screamed all thru the movie, and cried thru most, keep her blaringly red lipstick with copious amounts of lip gloss intact to the very end of the movie?

It may not have made the silver screen but I found it to be more entertaining than most of the recently released movies that cost ten bucks a hit. As a matter of fact, I rented the thing twice and ended up buying a copy from my locale Movie Gallery. It's just a really cool storyline and the right setting. Matt McCoy really plays his role and they pay homage to our girl, Dee Wallace Stone. If you need a good creature feature one Friday night ,go get this and have fun.",1191456000,,700,4.154411764705882

2613647,4,B000GI3RGK,"One of the greatest of guilty pleasures is the Bigfoot genre.  About 99% of these films are total schlock, coz really, how serious can you take the concept of a rampaging Bigfoot?  Abominable is a neat little film that's not afraid to realize it's schlocky nature, but at the same time has the balls to attempt moments of suspense.  Whether or not the suspense is effective is up to the viewer.  The suspense is in the form of the monster carnage being witnessed through the binoculars of the wheelchair bound leading man as the monster terrorizes the women in the neighboring house.  These scenes are actually pretty cool, and definitely bring to mind Rear Window.  Matt McCoy does an adequate enough job in the lead, the women are only there for eye candy and Bigfoot food.  Genre favorites Jeffrey Combs and Lance Henriksen are amusing enough, but wasted in tiny roles that has you wondering what the point was to having them in the film at all.  They certainly deserve more screen time than they got.  Regardless of what many folks may say, the monster is actually rather cool.  In a day and age where every friggin monster anymore has to be some cgi piece of crap, it's  a joy to see the ol ""man in a monster suit"".  And considering the schlockiness of the film anyway, it suits it(no pun intended) perfectly.  This movie isn't afraid of bloodshed either.  The kills are quick, but gruesome.  You won't see Abominable at the academy awards next year, but it's a welcome piece of B monster movie nonsense that's been missing from video shelves for awhile.",1171756800,2,1559,4.638686131386861
2613648,3,B000GI3RGK,"Ok, man, let's do some roleplay: you're Bigfoot. Sasquatch. The Abominable Snowman. I mean, you're a Big Guy, you're buff, you work out at the gym about 5 times a week, you can bench press 380 without breaking a sweat, you're hot, you're young, you're happening.

And you can't get a date.

What's a rough and ready, frustrated, desperate Housesquatch to do? You want to mosey on into town, you wants to get your jive on, get your drink on, you want to get jiggy with some of the local hardbodied babes, where's the harm, man?

I'll tell you where the Harm is: every time Bigfoot checks out the local muchachitas, they scream. They take one look at Bigfoot, they scream bloody murder. How's that for a Dude's self esteem? It's like being in high school all over again. He's thinking ""oh my God, is it the hair? Does this animal-skin make my butt look fat?"". The works. The Big Guy's a total wreck.

So he tries to get them to chill: maybe he says ""hey babe, it's OK, what's your sign?"" except, because he's a Bigfoot, it comes out all growly scary like Phil Anselmo just off one of his Superjoint Ritual roadtrip jags: `Gaaarrrrrgh grwoooowwl rowgrrrrr"". And of course, the chick screams her head right off.

Now: there are rules for meeting the Sasquatch;

1)No sudden moves. Bigfoot (feet) don't like sudden moves. It makes them grouchy. Grouchy Bigfoot=Bad;

2)NO SCREAMING

So the Bigfoot tries to put the moves on the chick, to, you know, calm her down. He takes her arm, he's gonna console her. He's gonna show her some big piney mountain lovin'.

Only, well, he's a 1000 pound man eating brute, he doesn't know his own strength, and so her arm, um, comes off.

Bummer.

It doesn't have to happen like that: the girl could go all dovey and pet bigfoot's fur, and coo ""oh Bigfoot, you have some----reaaaallly---BIG FEET"" or ""you're so abominably...HUGE"". He'd melt. He'd be a little kitty cat. They'd head down to Cancun for the weekend together. But you know, this is life, and life, especially for Bigfeet, just ain't all that.

The lead actor (who looks ominously, eerily, like Steve Carrell) realllllly takes his role seriously. He means it. He's serious, even if nobody else is. He's the kind of guy who probably spent time in the director's trailer quibbling over, maybe even REWRITING, bits of his dialogue. The guy is a true believer, bully for him; meanwhile walk-ons Jeff Combs, Lance Henriksen, & Paul Gleason are, you know, flying casual.

Anyway, Lead Actor arrives, trying to get past the horrific grief of his wife taking a grand jete over the nearby cliff, and figures out the hot chicks next door in Cabin #2 have more on their minds than the next Federline CD: like, how to survive becoming kibble for the bummed-out Bigfoot. Hilarity ensues.

Lead Actor Guy does what he has to do to Save the Day. And ya know, he does, somewhat, though not from Bigfoot's perspective, who pays his club cover-charge and, yet again (*sigh*) goes home empty handed.

The flick misses a few obvious cues, particularly the mighty creepy potential left on the barrelhead of stalking the Bigfoot---and being stalked in turn, hunted down, tracked---in the Big Tall Spooky Woods. It would have been cool if somebody had used a Bazooka. There are no *real* scares here, and the Bigfoot, given all the Hell he had to deal with, should have unleashed Holy Jihad on Lead Actor Guy and taken a dump on the ruins.

But one thing's for sure: never judge a Bigfoot until you've walked a mile in his, um, Big Feet.

2613662,4,B000GI3RGK,"Basically a guy is in a wheelchair due to falling down a cliff while rock climbing with his wife 6 months earlier (she died), it never really explains why he is at this house in the woods but anyway I will let you know.... it has a few jumpy moments, there is a bit of gore, the momster has pink ping pong balls as his eyes, other than that he looks pretty good.

There is a very funny moment when this girl has just seen her friends butchered by the monster, is absolutely beside herself, she managed to scramble into this guys wooden hut and lock the door, the music comes on and he starts telling her the whole sad story about why he is in a wheelchair and that he was kept alive for a reason etc. etc & that she will be safe with him, think he seems to forget that he has just seen a MONSTER rip the door of the hut she was in and is currently devouring all her friends outside his own front door !!!! She seems to forget this too as she is sat goofy faced listening to his story looking pretty calm and safe !!!

One thing that got me about this movie, noone through the centuries believed that this monster existed, as it creeps around in the forests like a shy recluse etc., which is what it is like at the beginning of the film, why does it then suddenly decide to expose itself and tear everything that moves to pieces ????  Yes I know its a horror film, but normally monsters appear/arrive from somewhere, this thing has just walked down the hill !!! lol

2613663,5,B000GI3RGK,"I recently caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel. I thought that is was just going to be another lame movie about Bigfoot. But, I was wrong. The movie starts with a great bigging mystery that hooks you well. That made me want to watch more. So I stayed and watched more of the movie and began to get fairly involved. After the initial hook, the pace slows down a little to get the storyline started. Basically the movie is about a man who lived in this small town and did a lot of rock climbing while he was there. His wife supposedly dies durring a rock climbing accident. But he knows that it was bigfoot that did it. He returns to his home in the mountains with his nurse as he is now paralized from the waist down. While there a group of girls move into the house across the street. Well, I'm sure you can tell that this is the main part of the story. Well, the man sees Bigfoot and for the next few days he terrorizes everyone there.

Overall, I thought it was a great flick. Worthy of a good award somewhere. The effects are great and the story keeps you on your toes. I usually never find myself yelling at my TV but I ended up screaming for them to run. I would say that if you are going to see a new bigfoot movie, see this one.

2613664,5,B000GI3RGK,"Those who have taken the time to skim through my other reviews here should already know the complete and total disdain I harbor towards 2003's ""Sasquatch."" Let me just say, Ryan Schifrin's ""Abominable"" is everything that snoozer wasn't and yet should have been.

When this particular movie initially debuted on the SCI-FI Channel, it was rated the #1 telecast in SCI-FI's Top Ten programs for the week. And for good reason. ""Abominable,"" Schifrin's first film, provides all the nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat thrills fans of this genre live for. This official DVD edition restores the film to its full uncensored glory, re-instating the gore that was considered too graphic by the network.

Brilliantly combining elements of Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" and Twilight Zone's ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,"" this endeavor details what unfolds when a murderous sasquatch embarks on a rampage in a remote forest community. Matt McCoy is perfectly cast in the role of Preston Rogers, a paraplegic who, in lingering grief over the loss of his wife, retires to the beckoning solace of his summer chalet. Once there, he becomes preoccupied with a jeep-load of spritely college coeds who have settled into the neighboring cabin. What he doesn't anticipate, however, is the sudden and shocking arrival of a beast immortalized in legend, Bigfoot. The shadowy creature is stalking the girls, gruesomely dispatching them one at a time, while a helpless Preston observes in stark unrivaled terror.

Along for the ride in supporting cameos are Jeffrey Combs, Dee Wallace-Stone(who I, personally, am glad to see is still working), and the ever-entertaining Lance Henriksen. The late Paul Gleason, fondly remembered by me in such films as ""Die Hard"" and ""The Breakfast Club,"" even makes an amusing appearance as the hard-nosed, skeptical town sheriff.

Much has been communicated within varying circles about the creature's odd appearance here. Having never honestly seen a genuine flesh and blood sasquatch in my entire life, I can't begin to speculate over just how accurate this specific portrayal may or not be. While certainly bizarre, in terms of its freakish facial construction, I have to say the overall effect is still quite formidable. Stuntman, Mike Deak, who excels in these physical roles, manages to pull off the presence of the monster with great care and genuine menace. Be aware that his Bigfoot is not the cuddly teddy-bear we all shed a tear for in ""Harry and the Hendersons."" Think more along the lines of ""Jaws With Claws.""

Ultimately, I would have to say beyond a doubt, that I really was surprised by every last frame of this production. Ryan Schifrin has an eye for artistic detail that is unmatched by most other bigger-named directors. His enthusiasm for this film, specifically, exudes in sheer volumes throughout the accompanying featurette. He had his hands on every aspect of the project, from the location scouting to the overall appearance of the titular monster. It is for that reason, alone, that I strongly recommend this release. It's not high art, nor was it ever intended as such. It's a horror film in the classic mold, brought forth in a style I would actually like to see more directors employ.

Do not pass this one up!",1165017600,3,3239,5.090395480225989
2613665,2,B000GI3RGK,"Or how about B is for, ""An R Rated scooBy Doo""? Yes, it's really that silly.

Funny thing about Abominable is that I was actually entertained. But was it a good movie? The idea of providing potential viewers/purchasers of this movie with a customer review is to help them decide whether or not the movie is worthy of purchase, right? Or let's just say that a review here is to determine whether or not you should even rent/view.

I gave Abominable 2 stars. Then why...after I just said I was entertained by Abominable...would I only give it 2 stars? Well, it's this dilemma I've been having with trying to fairly rate movies in order ""to be helpful"". What I mean is, in the genre:

Aliens would be 5 stars. Therefore, is Abominable a 5 star movie comparatively? No way.

The Descent would be 4 stars. Therefore, is Abominable a 4 star movie comparatively? No way.

Slither would be 3 stars. Therefore, is Abominable a 3 star movie comparatively? No way.

I am left with an entertaining movie that doesn't compare to the aforementioned. Hence, I can (fairly) only give Abominable 2 stars, right?

Look, according to Amazon a 2 star rating means, ""I didn't like it"". But that's not really true. It was okay. It started good and went quickly into the spiraling vortex of a silly, continuity-issue, B-acted, made-for-TV Horror flick.

So go for it if you're compelled to watch a movie about Big Foot gone wild with the classic deaths of those that break the ""Scream"" rules of what you're not supposed to do in a Horror movie (complete with gratuitous nudity) in order to stay alive. Abominable is not quite as bad as the 2-star ""I didn't like it"" rating that I donned it with. But it sure ain't no 3-star Slither.

It's a 2006 made for TV B-movie.

2613667,4,B000GI3RGK,"A man lost his life in a climbing accident and is now in a wheelchair.  His therapist has brought him back to the scene as part of his emotional therapy.  Stuck in a lodge he begins to watch a group of young women who have arrived next door.  While looking he notices the phone pole has been knocked down.  Then, one of the women steps outside to use a cell phone.  Suddenly she disappears and her phone is lying on the ground.  Then he thinks he sees eyes looking back at him from the woods.  He retreats deeper into the lodge and turns off the lights.

Once the therapist returns things really pick up.  Soon the therapist is out of the picture and our hero tries to warn the girls next door about what is going on.  At first they think he is a pervert but soon the real problem becomes apparent.  Who lives and who dies gets pretty tense until the final scene which is not the shocker it was intended to be if you paid attention earlier.

This was a nice treatment of a favorite movie of mine but it lacked Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly.  The effects were pretty good and the suspense built nicely.  Like a classic Corman film we see little of the monster at first.  This is a particularly fun scene with Jeffrey Combs, Lance Henricksen and another as they are looking for the monster.  All in all I really enjoyed this one.  Other reviews had made me expect a lesser movie but I was really pleased.

2613668,3,B000GI3RGK,"Welcome to the 21st century, where actors still dress up in monster suits and terrorize nubile young ladies and drunken hunters.  ABOMINABLE includes footage not seen when aired on the Sci-Fi Channel and although not horrible, it's just average.  Director Ryan Schifrin (the son of composer Lalo Schifrin, who does this film's score) manages to create an atmosphere of impending doom, only the monster itself is so corny we never really get scared.

To Schifrin's credit, he also manages to grab great cameos from horror vets like Jeffrey Combs, Rex Linn, Dee Wallace Stone and Lance Henriksen...always fun to watch.  A stronger male lead may have helped.  Matt McCoy is simply awful in his performance, pulling out every stock facial expression in the book....one of the worst performances I've seen in recent horror films.

everyone is dying to be killed, most actings are silly.

Disappointment!!!",1160784000,2,232,5.052631578947368
2613670,4,B000GI3RGK,"Compared to many recent Bigfoot-inspired flicks, ""Abominable"" is a true work of art.  Consider that its biggest competition comes from ""Sasquatch,"" ""Sasquatch Hunters,"" and the awful ""Clawed,"" and I'm sure you'll agree with me.  Perhaps it doesn't deserve four stars (three-and-a-half would be a better rating), but this movie just has too much going for it than to toss it to the wayside.

First of all, the story is a labor of love by director/writer Ryan Schifrin.  In the commentary and the documentary, ""Back to Genre:  Making Abominable,"" Schifrin comes across as a very likeable, very grounded guy.  You can't not want to cheer for him and his creation.  He managed to pick up a third-tier leading man, Matt McCoy, to take the lead role, used the creature designer, Christien Tinsley, as probably the funniest jerk in recent flicks, scooped up the legendary Lance Henriksen, Jeffrey Combs and Dee Wallace Stone for key cameo roles and the unforgettably funny Paul Gleason (The Breakfast Club) to portray the local sheriff.

Secondly, the actual DVD is awesome considering it is an independently produced film.  It comes in a nice sleeve like most popular big studio flicks do.  It's got wonderful liner notes by Schifrin and a nice tribute to Paul Gleason.  Also, the artwork is top-notch.  You'll recognize the style used as that of Drew Struzan.  You know who he is, he designed the ""Star Wars"" posters, the ""Indiana Jones"" posters, and a ton of others.  As far as extras are concerned, there's the aforementioned documentary and commentary, outtakes and bloopers, extended and deleted scenes, storyboard and stills gallery, a student film by Schifrin and the screenplay for those with DVD-ROM capabilities.

The movie takes place deep in the California forests where McCoy's character, Preston, has been taken for a little rehab since losing his wife and the ability to walk in a climbing accident.  He's cared for by the very uncaring Otis (Christien Tinsley).  When Otis leaves to get some soy milk (Preston's allergic), a small group of good-looking, giggly girls move into the cabin next door for a bachelorette party.  That gaggle of giggly ladies includes female lead, Haley Joel, and my personal favorite scream queen, Tiffany Shepis.

When the sun goes down, the body count goes up.  Bound by his wheelchair, Preston can do nothing but watch as the creature takes out each girl one-by-one.  Preston desperately attempts to warn the girls and the sheriff's department via wireless internet.  The girls think he's a peeping tom, and want nothing to do with him.  The sheriff thinks he's either crazy or playing a practical joke, and holds his deputies back from going to check on the girls and Preston.

There are a couple of things that are wrong with this film.  First of all, the music is hit-and-miss.  Sometimes it is dead-on with building tension.  At other times it's nothing but overkill.  Secondly, there's the subpar acting of a couple of the girls in the cabin across from Preston's.  Granted, I don't expect Oscar-worthy performances, but I just felt that a couple of the girls weren't acting as well as the could have.  Finally, and this is the biggie, the creature looks sort of like Jack Elam (this fact is also noted on a messageboard at IMDB).  He's not that scary once you get to see him in all of his hairy glory.  He's got bug-eyes and a jack o'lantern smile and isn't very consistent with his footspeed.  However, he does manage to give the audience quite a few ""boo!!"" moments that make up for his slightly silly look.

There's actually quite a bit of good scares in this flick.  As stated before, when the music is on, it is extremely good at building suspense.  You'll want to cheer for Preston as he tries to both warn the girls and save his own hide.  The brief appearances of Henriksen and Combs are both funny and action-packed.  Dee Wallace Stone is luckier than most in this film, but it's great to see her on the screen.  Overall, this is a really good horror flick to watch.  Sure, it has its bad points, but it's all made up for with excellent pacing, good lighting, and plenty of 80's era gore.

There is quite a bit of violence and gore in this flick, including explosive stomping of bodies, face-biting, body snapping, car crashes, axes hacking, needle injections, and on and on.  The language can get pretty rough at times, though I've heard much worse in other R-rated flicks such as this one.  There's also a little obligatory nudity from one of the lasses.  In short, your kids shouldn't watch this.

For a wonderful evening of mindless violence and comedy, as well as a pretty decent flick all around, ""Abominable"" is sure to please.  If you're a big fan of Sasquatch, definitely purchase this flick.  If you appreciate B-cinema, you'll enjoy this film.
