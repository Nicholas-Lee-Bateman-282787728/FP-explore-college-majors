1736512,5,B00006ADD7,Paul Naschy has put his heart and soul and imagination into horror movies for decades. Werewolf Shadow is a fine example of what the man is all about. Fun? You bet. Creepy and weird? You got it. Cheesy? Sure is. Passionate? Yep it's that too. Naschy gives another passionate performance here and the tragic and romantic elements of his character make this something special. The quality of the print is damn nice too. The special features help to make this even more of a winner for fans of B-movie horror.,1093392000,5,506,4.633333333333334
1736513,5,B00006ADD7,"This movie is so far gone, it's not from this planet. A werewolf gets revived at the beginning, he drools like a St. Bernard with rabies, rips pieces of raw meat from his victims, add to that plenty of nudity, blood, a vampire woman, violence, and a cheap production, and dubbed in English-this is one wild movie, and lots of fun.",1069286400,5,330,4.426229508196721
1736514,3,B00006ADD7,"In the interview that comes on the DVD, Paul Naschy says that Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman was the movie that made him a horror buff. You can see that inspiration in Werewolf Shadow - right down to recreating the opening sequence. In fact, despite the gore and nudity that punctuates the plot, this film is a lot like those old Universal Horror movies of the forties. Despite some boring stretches (particularly in the restored sequences) and some trite dialogue, the film moves along at a brisk pace and contains some impressive (if not scarey) images - such as the Countess, all dressed in flowing black, fleeing back to her tomb, her mummified undead assistant attacking the heroine in the ruined castle, and a recently vamped girl appearing in a corridor all aswirl with mist. The final fight between the werewolf and the vampire Countess is a bit of a let down, but up til then things haven't been too bad at all.",1050883200,5,920,4.685185185185185

7966175,5,B00006ADD7,"This is a very good print of what is normally named  ""The Werewolf vs. the Vampire Women"".  It is clear, bright, colorful, and appears uncut in all its bloody glory.  One of my favorite Paul Naschy movies.",1448755200,,205,4.486486486486487

7966178,2,B00006ADD7,"While performing an autopsy a man removes silver bullets from Paul Naschy and viola! We have a movie! Two coeds traveling in Europe looking for a dead female vampire who drank the blood of virgins stumble upon the manor of the only werewolf in Europe. who happens to live nearby. The vampire died by a silver cross to the heart, something our man Paul can carry around with him, without any side effects.

Entertaining from a campy point of view.

This feature has been poorly transferred to DVD and on some copies, the few nude scenes have been cut. Night time shots appear to be done with natural lighting, and that is bad.",1389312000,,625,4.522123893805309
7966179,5,B00006ADD7,"Werewolf Shadow (A.K.A: The Werewolf v.s. Vampire Woman) is another true classic of Paul Naschy. Decent story line, decent acting and again with the crazy werewolf of Paul Naschy this movie is very good for any horror fan. Again, if you like cheese in your horror, this one is a keeper. Recommended!",1164758400,,299,4.769230769230769
7966180,3,B00006ADD7,"Just a disclaimer...the version I viewed, from the Mill Creek Drive In Classics package, is the cut 82 minute version...here we go...

Paul Naschy stars as tormented lycanthrope Waldamer, who lives in a cottage in the French countryside. Seems the only thing that can give ol Waldy the death he desires is a silver cross used centuries before to vanquish a devil-worshipping vampire Countess. Along come some young Spanish girls who know where her tomb is, and wah-la, Naschy has the cross and the girl who loves him that must deliver the blow. One problem. Seems removing this silver cross raises the Countess from the, uh, undead, and she proceeds to start raising a vampire army and trying to summon Mr. Scratch himself (who appears in a small shadowy cameo late in the picture). These would be bad things. Anyway, the girl who falls for him has another boyfriend, a policeman, who comes calling for her. They get captured by the Countess and all types of heck break loose. Can Waldemar stop her? Will he finally get his eternal rest? Will we get to see some real vampire on werewolf goodness? To the last point, at least in this print, alas, no. But it's still a good film with clunky dubbing. Hope to see the uncut version at some point, and some more Naschy films too. This cat's pretty cool.",1152403200,,1298,4.643478260869565
7966181,1,B00006ADD7,Long. Drawn out. Boring. Barely any nudity. A complete waste of time for a 70's horror flick.,1141948800,4,93,4.529411764705882
7966182,4,B00006ADD7,"Its good to see the Naschy movies being released here in the states (although at a slow pace). This one was long over due as the butchered version known as Werewolf Vs. The Vampire Woman is such a bad print its hardly worth watching. The DVD treatment of Werewolf Shadow is quite good in its uncut/unedited wide screen glory. While these movies are not for everyone there is a following for them. If you are a Naschy fan you will enjoy this one even though Curse Of The Devil is a bit better in my estimation. A werewolf,vampires and nude cuties. Whats not to love?",1095811200,7,565,4.390476190476191
