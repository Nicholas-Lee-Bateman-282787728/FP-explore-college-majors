It met my expectations fully.

However, after viewing the VHS tape only twice the tape broke off at one end of the reel.  I could not open the cassette to repair the tape because of a safety screw that is nearly impossible to remove.  I'll have to return this I think.",1502668800,,342,4.2153846153846155
8155776,4,B000BY3Y80,"This film is a bit of a treasure for anyone who has been involved in theatre, even as an audience member. Langella and Hulce are very good, and there are some great, funny bits, such as the war between Langella's self-absorbed actor and the backstage crew. But for me Langella's monologue about being in the theatre is the best moment of the film. And if you like this, rent or buy Slings and Arrows, the great Canadian TV series about an imaginary Shakespeare festival -- it's even a more wonderful treatment of the life in the theatre. Why isn't this available on DVD?",1406246400,,570,4.543689320388349

8155778,4,B000BY3Y80,Enjoyed seeing it more than the first time I saw it. Frank Langella shines in it for he is a man of the stage. A great actor in movies but so much better live on a stage. A light bit of comedy tops off this movie with a splash of reality comes together nicely.,1244678400,5,260,3.8333333333333335
8155779,4,B000BY3Y80,"If you've ever done theater, on or offstage, high school, college, community, strawhat or equity, you'll want to enjoy some of the giggles in this movie. Much is over- or under- or wrong-ly done, but there are many precious moments you will enjoy.
  Langella is at his best (with some very tacky dialogue!) and Tom Hulce is the early version of Broderick Crawford, meaning good.
  It's like the comedy version of ""Marjorie Morningstar"" with shtick.",1239667200,,448,4.933333333333334
