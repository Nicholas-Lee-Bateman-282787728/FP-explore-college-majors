8703302,5,B00TY6CLQW,"This is a Hulu Original program that parodies the Real Housewives reality program series. It is SO funny! (I don't even watch Real Housewives and loved it!) You will recognize many members of the cast from other sitcoms. It is very well done! I bought this DVD set as a gift for a family member. She loved it, too! (The set itself is pretty basic -- just the first season, not a lot of bonus features, etc -- but that was just fine by me.) I can't wait for them to release The Hotwives of Las Vegas to DVD and hope they do a third season. Really entertaining!",1461024000,,559,4.185185185185185
8703303,3,B00TY6CLQW,"This DVD release is extremely bare bones. There's no bonus features, no subtitle or alternate language options even. Aside from the profanity being uncensored it's exactly the same as it was on Hulu. The show itself is great and very funny but the DVD is so lackluster and disappointing that you'd be better off just getting it off Amazon video for cheaper.",1432512000,,357,4.774193548387097
8703304,2,B00TY6CLQW,"Quick disclaimer: My two star rating is the for the protect itself, not the actual show.

Words cant express how much I *love* this show. I have binge watched the entire series on more than one occasion, usually when a friend or family member mentions they never heard of it; creating fans in the process. If you stumbled upon this dvd listening, more than likely you're already a fan and know the nature of the show. In addition, a previous reviewer, EA Solinas, already created a well-read description of the show, so Im going to focus on the content of the actual dvd.

1) No extras. This is a shame, since I can only imagine how funny the outtakes would have been, especially given that the different actresses have worked together on previous shows. I know this is a hulu show, but interviews would have been a nice touch or even some background on the talented actress and show itself (how it came it be). Even a quick description on how the characters were developed for those that don't actually watch the reality shows this show is parodying on.
2) This is uncensored. Im probably the few that find it more funny when curse words are beeped out, so I was a little disappointed that there was so audio option for this (a as seen on hulu version for example).
3) No subtitles.
4) Only English audio.
5) Widescreen (so you do have two little bars on top and bottom of the screen).
6) Episodes aren't longer or changed from what youve seen on Hulu (unless you count the DVD being uncensored).
7) All episodes are on one disc, but don't suffer from quality issues.
8) No insert.

Other than that, there's really nothing else to say about the DVD itself, except if you couldn't tell, you're only getting the episodes - nothing more, nothing less. I feel like this could easily pass as a bootleg version of the show.",1431561600,,1818,4.503030303030303
8703305,4,B00TY6CLQW,"One of the worst reality franchises to infect television is the ""Real Housewives"" series, in which not-as-rich-as-they-pretend-to-be women have contrived drama while fulfilling a lot of ugly, sexist stereotypes. So it's kind of amazing that it took this many years for a full-blown parody to be produced. That would be the ""Hotwives of Orlando,"" which follows the lives of six women (not all wives) who are wrapped up in scandal, sex, drugs and the occasional crazed brawl in designer gowns.

Every episode opens with the Hotwives posing (sometimes getting hair blown in their mouths) in front of a glittery CGI background, and dropping sassy catchphrases like, ""You don't have to be Mr. Right to end up with me. You just need to not have chlamydia!""

The Hotwives include:
- Tawny St. John (Casey Wilson), a gold-digging ""small town girl who dreamed of the big life"" with a dying husband (except he's not dying, just allergy-riddled) and a personal trainer lover.
- Money-squandering, rage-filled Italian-American Shauna Maducci (Danielle Schneider) who believes everyone (the plumber, the cops, the foreclosure rep) is trying to sleep with her husband.
- Lawyer/foot model/minister/taxidermist Phe Phe Reed (Tymberlee Hill), who uses ""I'm just being Phe Phe!"" to compensate for her rudeness.
- Seemingly-British Veronica Von Vandervon (Andrea Savage) who constantly explains her vulgar sex jokes and is sleeping with her teen pool boy.
- The holier-than-thou Crystal Simmons (Angela Kinsey) who hasn't read the Bible because it's ""written in Jewish"" and only her controlling husband can interpret it properly.
- Amanda Simmons (Kristen Schaal), Crystal's sister, who peaked in a prune juice commercial (""As easy going in as it is going out!"") as a child and is now perpetually high and drunk.

There is also Crystal's gossipy friend Alli (Dannah Phirman) who desperately wants to be a Hotwife; the ghastly producer (Paul Scheer); and a large number of husbands from the controlling jerk T.J. (Seth Morris) who declares that ""Prostitution is a sin, like murder and adultery and female orgasms,"" the oblivious Phil (Stephen Tobolowsky), who doesn't realize that Tawny is cheating on him, and the perpetually unfaithful Rodney (Jerry Minor).

The series rests on a long string of parties, beginning with Tawny's charity (which supplies high heels for dogs) and including an intervention party, a child's birthday party, a ""pimps and hoes"" party, a seance party with a ""ghost shouter,"" and a vow renewal at a mini-golf course that is busted by the cops.

And among the dramatic problems they have are a vicious feud between Shauna and Tawny (""She was my best friend, but she told me to CALM DOWN!""); Amanda's ongoing sobriety issues; friendship breakups (""We'll still hang out all the time! We're just not FRIENDS!""); Phe Phe's divorce; grotesquely autotuned pop songs; Shauna losing her house to foreclosure and having to move into a tent; the death of Veronica's ""Lover"" (her dog); and finally the reunion special, with more squabbling, crying and claims of illness.

It's actually a little sad that ""Hotwives of Orlando"" doesn't even need to exaggerate the Real Housewives that much -- lots of narcissistic, selfish women being shallow and snippy and easily offended. Also, cosmetic procedures and spending too much money. So it's rife with comedy when exaggerated just a little, usually based on actual Real Housewives' foibles (substance abuse, bad temper, faux-Christianity, blaming things on editing, and so on).

Most of the wickedly funny writing is in the dialogue (""I miss being married. Sex with other women is SO much more exciting that way!""), but also in the character descriptions (Veronica is described as ""Sad Rich White Woman""). Some of the running gags aren't fully exploited (Crystal's disdain for her sister) but they do tend to be rather funny, especially when the characters massively overreact to absolutely nothing at all (Tawny and Shawna trying to determine who's the better prostitute). And there are subtle hints that it's all staged (they painstakingly move a coffee table before having a brawl).

And all the actresses are pretty awesome -- Schneider and Hill chew the scenery with roaring delight, Savage feels like she's about to burst out into gleeful giggles at all times (""He was a sexy dog! You didn't have to make out with him!""), and Wilson is pretty good as a vacuous blonde who constantly crawls all over her trainer. Kinsey feels like she's playing a dimmer, richer version of her ""Office"" character (which she does quite well), and Schaal plays a pitiful but hilarious ex-child star.

For anyone who thinks reality TV needs to just calm down, ""Hotwives of Orlando"" is a welcome parody that only seems... SLIGHTLY exaggerated. Fun, wickedly barbed little comedy show.",1424995200,3,4808,5.169665809768637
