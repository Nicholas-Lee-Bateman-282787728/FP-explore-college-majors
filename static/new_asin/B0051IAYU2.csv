8452771,5,B0051IAYU2,"The late and super under-rated Luna Vachon and former husband
Vampire Warrior aka Gangrel talk about the behind the scenes of the WWF
This is a awesome interview all around Luna is very honest and candid about the business she grew up in
She put her heart and soul into Pro Wrestling and the same business help destroy her too!
she tells very interesting stories about her famous family the Vachon's and breaking into the business
her time in the WWF being jobbed out to of all people Sable
Gangrel also talks about breaking into the business meeting Luna there relationship
he tells very interesting and fun stories

It's a real shame Luna is one of a handful of legit shoot fighting woman in pro wrestling
In 2015 you have no Divas, Knockouts, etc. that are even close to the same level as Luna
She is one of a very small percent that didn't play politics and use being a woman to get a head in a male dominated sport

If you are a fan of Luna Vachon it's a must see!  It's a fascinating but, very heartbreaking interview by a woman that gave it her all for a business that never fully respected her and her value  10/10",1450224000,,1122,4.354066985645933
