This is an old Joyce Vedral workout on VHS that was later put on DVD.  The biggest problem that I have with this workout is the use of the word ""interval"".  Different people use it to mean either (a) a workout that alternates cardio and strength (which I call a circuit workout) or (b) segments of the same type of workout at different intensities (which I call an interval workout).  I think that this workout was intended to be a circuit workout, but, for me, is a true interval workout - well, 2/3s of it.

This workout is made up of three sections where they alternate the same type of cardio (Joyce does walking type moves with her own unique twist and her daughter is on the bike) with three toning moves.  They do each of these rounds of cardio/toning moves and then move onto the next section.  However, the toning moves, to me, are more cardio effect than strength because they are shallow and quick.  For the cardio, I either do walking type moves or use my gliding discs.  In the first section, they focus on the thighs, in the second section, they focus on the glutes, and in the third section, they focus on the abs (and go to the floor).  I hate going to the floor in the middle of a cardio workout, so I do standing moves like knee ups and punches.  Once they have been through the three sections, they give you the option of repeating them - with the exact same footage.  For some reason, this doesn't bother me.

I have had this workout for awhile and pull it out on mornings when I feel tired and brain dead.  Joyce chatters a lot in this workout and will turn some people off.  Given how I feel when I do this workout, it doesn't bother me.  It's a good workout for me to keep because (a) I can use my gliding discs with it and (b) it's an interval workout, a type of workout I don't have too many of.",1428969600,,1954,4.249322493224932
