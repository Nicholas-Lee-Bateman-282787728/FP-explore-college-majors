This movie is TURKLES.  There is no character in it called SAMMY THE TURTLE and it is not frightening to anyone age 4 or 6.",1389312000,6,221,4.238095238095238

6163423,1,B00HHEBMMC,"I love Turtles, but I hated this movie.  The picture is misleading, it looks like an animated movie.  There are barely any turtles in this movie.  Most of the movie is very bad acting by humans about their relationship problems.

On the upside, I had good laugh AT the movie because it was so terrible.",1465603200,,302,4.4363636363636365

6163427,1,B00HHEBMMC,"Did anyone else think this was going to be a cartoon when they first played it?  I sure did and my son definitely did.  We were disappointed when it was a live action, low budget movie on a beach instead.  The director loved his extreme closeups, too; that is for sure.  My 3 year old lost interest about ten minutes in, once he realized the live action was not going to switch over to animation.  Sorry Turkles.",1464048000,,412,4.298701298701299
6163428,1,B00HHEBMMC,"This was very amateurish, and I did not find it very entertaining. I appreciate the messages that they are putting forward, but I did not think it was done in a way to do justice to the importance of the messages.",1463961600,,213,4.219512195121951

6163431,4,B00HHEBMMC,"While I thought the movie was a bit cheesy, and the acting a bit stilted, it was a cute story. If had been a film for adults, I would probably have been disappointed, but as a kids movie, it works OK.

It's a very campy (not in a good way) soapbox movie about something that is truly very serious.  I feel it would have been better, and more respectful to the subject matter, to educate about turtle poaching via an actual documentary rather than (in my opinion) a very ""painful"" movie to watch.  The story, the acting, pretty much everything but the actual information about turtle hatching, was unbearable to watch.

I would recommend doing a Google search on the subject and avoiding this movie altogether.",1409443200,4,626,4.8584905660377355
6163518,1,B00HHEBMMC,terrible acting.,1407542400,,16,7.5
6163519,2,B00HHEBMMC,"I really wanted to like this movie! It has an interesting subject, some really nice cinematography--especially the turtle footage--, and the two lead child actors aren't bad for an indy film.

Many of the other actors are much less able. I couldn't help suspecting that many of the minor-role kids were forced by their parents to take part.  They stand there and deliver their lines so woodenly! Any small-town high school drama department could field half a dozen kids that could do better, and a director who cared could have at least convinced the kids to try to sound like they were actually saying something instead of self-consciously delivering a meaningless string of words read off a cue card.

But bad acting, especially from kids, is tolerable. Not sure whether to blame the writing or directing, but there is no character building or even necessary exposition. The main characters don't even speak for the first ten minutes or so of the film. About 20-25 minutes in, the main boy's mother gives a wildly emotional speech about ""Nobody will ever give you a chance because you're a trailer park kid!"" This pretty much comes out of the blue, with nothing leading up to it and not much coming of it later. Another example is the main boy's cousin.  Mom tells the boy he's coming to stay and to look after him. The boy's response is something like, ""Aw, do I have to? He doesn't even talk.""  The cousin shows up and appears in two or three scenes, where he smiles and nods at people who talk to him.  Is he mute? Is he retarded? Is he just a silent character? We don't know until much later when he awkwardly mumbles the word 'Turkles,' and Mom tears up and goes, ""OMG, you spoke! YOU SPOKE!!!!!!"" Okay, so something was wrong with him, I guess.  Or Mom is the biggest overacter who ever lived (evidence submitted: trailer park kid speech.)

The biggest unbalance to the film were the villains, though.  You know how, since Goonies and Home Alone, it seems nine out of ten kids' live-action films feature a pair of bumbling, clownish crooks?  Well, this movie has four, count 'em, four.  Freakish and stupid enough to make you suspect that they are actually escaped mental patients. As the movie goes on, they are given more and more and more screen time to goof around being more freakish than funny. I would compare them the the three stooges, but sadly, there was no Moe Howard to smack the others when they were being particular morons.

Here's pretty much how the movie went.
1. Films of sea turtles: excellent.
2. Interesting and informative speech by camp leaders about sea turtles and how they are endangered and protected. Main characters stand in the background doing nothing until they are introduced, after which they go on doing nothing much.
3. Villains show up, evil mob boss hires them to steal turtle eggs.
4. Villains steal a nest of eggs.
5. Heroes show up, Oh, noes! Who could have done this? We must catch them!
6. Villains clown around more, steal another nest of eggs.

After the fourth nest was robbed, frankly, I stopped watching. Somewhere in there was shoehorned the trailer park kid speech, the mute cousin, and a romance-building scene where the kid recited a poem their old teacher made them learn. I thought it was actually a decent scene, if there had been any proper framing or build-up to it. The kids sneak out at night to lurk waiting for the crooks a couple of times, and are arrested on suspicion of having vandalized the nest themselves, but are released as innocent because their parents show up to scream ""OMG, they didn't do it!  They're just KIDS!"" (Seriously, Mom-actress. Get a soap opera.)

My recommendation for this movie: Yes, rent it.  The sea turtle scenes and information at the beginning are interesting and worth seeing.  If, at some point afterward, you start getting bored or annoyed, turn it off then, because it probably isn't going to get any better. Unless there was a WOW ending I couldn't stand to stick around for.",1407369600,5,4200,4.654054054054054

6163526,5,B00HHEBMMC,"The film itself is wonderful. An important thing to consider is that this film was created on a budget of nine thousand dollars. As such, the production quality and acting are superb and far above what is to be expected for a production budget this low.

The sad part of this is that the film's distributor manipulated the sales income enough to create a breach of contract with the film's investors. The film has been seen by tens of thousands of viewers, yet the distributor has failed to forward even one dollar of those funds to the producers of the movie. Most of the actors are young children who have been cheated out of receiving even a nickle for their arduous contribution to this film.

In addition, the distributor cut many portions of the film that elicited tender moments between the actors, so what you are seeing is a chopped up version of the original movie as created by the producers.",1389744000,2,903,4.60248447204969
