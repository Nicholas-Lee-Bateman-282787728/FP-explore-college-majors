8669606,5,B00M1563F8,"According to my knowledge, this one is a first, i.e. rather than to pick a ""native"" 3D program from the made-for-IMAX library, the Stephen Low company went through the hazzle of having one of their acclaimed films, FIGHTER PILOT, converted into 3D.

The result is rather impressive. Except for the opening room sequence (too many pop-up impressions that give the ancestor gallery a fake look) I noticed only 4-5 brief glitches during the entire program where objects where not where they would have usually belonged. Considering 3D camera related artefacts of other and native IMAX 3D program content (misalignment in image border areas, 3D cameras not really suited for closeup shots like in RESCUE 3D), I found these glitches overall less distracting and negligible in comparison.

Since most of us mundanes will never have the opportunity to fly high up along with real jet fighters, this program in 3D gets you there as close as possible (and only 5-8% of the footage was recreated in the computer where mounting an IMAX camera would have been otherwise impossible).

This German Blu-ray features the original English language version but menu screens stay in German. Although labelled as Region Code B, I noticed this disc will also play in a Region Code A player, regardless.",1431648000,,1281,5.033018867924528
