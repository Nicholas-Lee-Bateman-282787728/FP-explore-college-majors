8189172,4,B000675ZQG,"Victor Mature plays an ex-GI stuck in a loveless marriage to a British woman who insists they return to England on his discharge.  He becomes a truck driver whose cargo is constantly pilfered by a criminal crew.  The gangster boss' moll is gorgeous Diana Dors, showing ample cleavage in low cut gowns, who entices Mature into an affair.  His personal life becomes conflicted, and he begins to work for the corrupt boss driving hot cargo.  The best scene is toward the end, when he drives an 18-wheeler through rock strewn bumpy roads and streams to reach an offload point.  Bleak story but good drama from Mature and Dors.",1467244800,,622,4.722222222222222
8189173,3,B000675ZQG,"As a fan of Victor Mature, while not a great actor he gave us some pretty entertaining movies to enjoy, this was not one of my favorites despite the performances of Mature, Diana Dors and Patrick Allen.  Mature plays a soldier getting out of the army in Europe with a good high paying job waiting for him with great potential in the US.  His wife refuses to bring their son and come to the states, instead forcing him to take a low paying truck driving job in England with her uncle.  Sounds depressing, it goes down hill from there in a film involving truck drivers and the criminal element.  I don't want to say too much about the storyline because it will give too much away.  There is a tepid romance between Mature and Dors as his marriage sours.  A bit of a depressing movie.  Mature fans may enjoy seeing him in a British crime story.  Standard fare, not a feel good movie.  Diana Dors, looking like a Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield, gives the feeling of a actress acting down to the role instead of being believable in the role.",1426377600,,1039,4.397905759162303

8189175,4,B000675ZQG,"The Long Haul, though not particularly lauded, is the type of crime film and British B-noir that, to me, makes for enjoyable viewing. I feel the same way about another Victor Mature film, The Las Vegas Story, where he is paired with the alluring Jane Russell.

In this film it is a bit of bad luck and the luscious Diana Dors (providing irresistible temptation) that lead Mature into a great deal of danger that will jeopardize not only his life, but his family.

Nothing award winning here, but a fine opportunity to just sit back and enjoy a pretty good film.",1393545600,5,561,4.544554455445544

It may not have the flair and special affects of todays movies but what it lacks there it makes up for in plot and the ability of the actors.",1363996800,5,261,4.3061224489795915
