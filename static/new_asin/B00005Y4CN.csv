7956315,5,B00005Y4CN,This movie was very well done. The concert was awsum and the quality was close to Blu-ray. Every song on this dvd was a master-piece. You hear the whole song and all the dialouge between songs. nothing was cut out. the entire concert. This concert was one of their best. I have one of the largest collections of their music in America.  A deffenite buy for all die hard fans.,1395705600,,375,4.357142857142857
7956316,1,B00005Y4CN,"I just paid $150 for a bootleg DVD. The video quality is good but there are no options on the menu, the back of the dvd case is a poor copy and cannot be read, and it only can be played in 2 of my 5 DVD players. I know this is a bootleg because I just purchased a real one in Japan; there are no problems with it.",1212969600,,313,3.550724637681159
7956317,5,B00005Y4CN,"The band was formed by childhood friends Yoshiki and Toshi in 1976. Lots of places on the internet to look up information on them. Just search for ""X Japan"" and ""X-Japan"" and ""XJapan"". Their music was an unusual blend of speed metal and ballads - hard rocking, guitar ripping, pounding beats blended with beautiful melodies - played by some of the best guitarists in Japan, one of the best drummers in the world (seriously) and sung by some guy with a voice sometimes like an angel, sometimes like a devil. All the songs are their own original compositions. They were also one of the pioneers of visual kei ""Visual Shock"" - well you can find out about that by looking up the band itself.

This review is for the Last Live performance from the Tokyo Dome, December 31st, 1997 - The band had announced it's break up without specifying reasons - which were rumored to be Toshi's wife's problems with his time commitments and some creative differences between the friends. They got together this last time to say goodbye to their fans in Japan.

Alright, this cd is probably the best live concert I have ever seen in 30 years of going to see the Stones, Metallica, Pink Floyd, G&R, Van Halen and all the icons of my generation. The audience participation is great in it. Honestly they miss a beat a couple times because they haven't been performing together for awhile, but really make up for it by the heart they put into the music. If you were watching the dvd you would see why they miss a beat. They're just all into the audience and one time Toshi makes Yoshiki cry with the opening to a song and Yoshiki pays him back by doing the same at the opening of the next song all the while trying to keep a beat going for 60,000 people singing along. If you want perfection, grab a studio cd but if you want Live... get this or the Dahlia tour cd (if you can find it).",1203465600,4,1862,4.409883720930233
