8027836,3,B0002FHQVE,"Murder She Wrote: The Murder of Sherlock Holmes

A woman descends the stairs holding a candle. The door was wide open. Is it Roger? She screams! [This is a play rehearsal.] One viewer figured it out. Jessica gets a telephone call from her nephew; he passed on her book to a publisher. It becomes a best seller! She will appear on some daily TV shows to publicize her novel. [They show lower Manhattan in the 1970's.] Jessica takes a train to New York. She autographs her book and appears on TV shows. [This mocks these TV shows.] She gets a subpoena! She is happy to return to Cabot Cove, but first she attends a party. The host practices shooting with a shotgun. Its a costume party, people imitate fictional characters. One man sees a light in his room. It is a private investigator, he won't talk. But he leaves. The party is winding down. The next morning a woman screams! A mans body floats in the pool. The police arrive. Why did no one hear the shot? The Chief of Police is in charge.

There is a surprise: Caleb is alive! That private investigator was the victim. Did the killer shoot the wrong man? A man is arrested on suspicion. A high-priced defense lawyer is called. A neighbor heard a loud noise at 11:15 PM, this must be the time of death. Jessica investigates. Her nephew was arrested for the crime! Caleb explains why his wife wouldnt do it. Jessica has a suspect. Is the information in a computer? Is a telephone call a clue? Can Jessica follow that bus? [The bus ride is 75 cents, exact change.] When she gets off the bus two young men try to rob her, but a stranger aid her. Jessica calls Chief Gunderson to tell what she learned. Later the body of Caleb is found on his sailboat, shot to death. The two people who passed on confidential business information have good alibis. Jessica will return home to Maine. But a newspaper column changed her mind! She returns to that house, now empty. She wants to tie up a loose end. What is she trying to prove?

The lights go on at 8 PM and off at 12 PM. She has a suspect in mind and explains. Preston explains his past, and why his character was the Count of Monte Cristo. Was that justification for murder? Im sorry he says. There is a peaceful solution to the conflict. [Believable?] Two wrestlers were found murdered, the police want her to help solve the crime. One was stabbed, the other drowned! But Jessica boards her train. Maybe she won't return home after all? [This must have been one of the earliest episodes, the stories improved to make this series popular. But at the end there were some changes to this show, viewers decreased, so the series ended.

I believe a small town or village would get help from the County or State police and not try to use inexperienced personnel. Its a matter of allocating resources efficiently. The idea of the police using an amateur is obsolete. This does not rule out technical experts (who will testify in favor of the side that pays them). This plot echoes The Valley of Fear by A. Conan Doyle. A mans face was destroyed by a shotgun blast; it turned out to be the assassin rather than his intended victim.",1453248000,,3121,4.451048951048951
8027837,5,B0002FHQVE,"I was VERY pleased to have found this, because not only am i still able to be one of the last(seemingly!)VHS hold-outs, but this story does not require a DVD to be GOOD!!
Jessica is just beginning, and it is awfully fun to see how she kind of gets ""roped into"" solving this murder.  It also sets up a lot of the background of the Show, and you see ""your favorites"" as they first appeared--both character-wise and physically.
I knew this was the absolute FIRST ""Murder, She Wrote,"" and was happy to have found it at such an attractive price and in such good condition.",1349568000,2,567,4.4
