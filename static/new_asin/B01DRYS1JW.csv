8756739,3,B01DRYS1JW,"BBC produced in Australia, it ran 2 13 episode seasons 2010 & 2011. If you buy it you'll get 7 episodes (the DVD doesn't list them in quite the same order as Amazon/Imdb and 1 episode?) and 3 mini features.
Set almost entirely in the family home (2 or 3 episodes have brief bits in other locations) no exterior scenes except for opening credits and stock exterior footage of the house. The home set is exceptional in quality by American standards and the three Henson creatures are good too4 people in the family, 3 episodes have 1 guest each. The stories are all silly, pretty child safe, have a little bit of a lesson to them but not very interesting if you're much past 12. Your 12 year old may soon get bored too.
