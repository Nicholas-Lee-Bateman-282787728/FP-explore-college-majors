8317848,5,B001LEI7B8,"Jay Lethal vs. Alex Shelley - This was one of the best matches on the card. Alex Shelly is a very talented wrestler and had a good character same as Lethal. These two had great chemistry as they were two of the greatest X Division stars in the history of TNA. It would be years later Lethal would defeat Kurt Angle. Shelly should have got used more but TNA used him right here to start off the show.

Lance Hoyt vs. Matt Bentley - This was just a good match hurt by the distraction of Eric Young & Alex Shelley dropping flyers from the ceiling asking for Sting. A good match but the finish took away from it. Traci Brooks was a welcome addition to the match.

Naturals vs. Team Canada Great tag team match between the two Team Canada shined here I thought. Bobby Roode showed flashes of the star he would become years later as a main eventer. Eric Young was entertaining ass always. The Naturals put on a good showing as they were an underrated tag team in TNA.

James Gang & Bob Armstrong vs. L.A.X. - It was a short good brawl but nothing special. Bullet Bob was twenty years past his prime in the match but it is always great to see The James Gang tag up. Homicide was a huge star in ROH and he was great in this match making his name in TNA. K-Dawg was okay.

Petey Williams vs. Chris Sabin vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Puma - Great X-division match. This was one of the pleasant surprises of the card. Petey Williams was an awesome wrestler. Dutt was always very underrated. Sabin was always one of the greatest stars of the X-division. Puma was great here too.

Rhino, Team 3D, Ron Killings vs. Jeff Jarrett, America's Most Wanted, Abyss - This was a great match. One of my favorite on the card as it was a well done brawl. It featured all great wrestlers from TNA. The match was non stop action and it had to be the second best match on the card.

Ultimate X Match: X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels - This was a good quality match between three of the biggest stars of TNA in history but it wasn't as good as their previous matches like Unbreakable.

NWA Champion Christian Cage vs. Monty Brown - This was a great match. I love both Monty and Cage. I thought Monty should have got a title run. I thought Cage and Monty had great chemistry and the story behind provided great realism to the wrestling. Cage left WWE came to TNA and took Monty's spot by winning the title. Monty being the homegrown TNA talent resented Cage and had a case for Cage being given a big break. Those two had a hell of a match and it's my favorite match on the card.

After the match Jarrett's crew came out to attack Cage but Steve Borden aka The Stinger came out to help kick ass and protect Cage only to be jumped by Scot Steiner who made his debut in TNA.

  Overall this dvd is not worth 52 dollars or more now seeing as it is out of print but I think if you see it cheap on ebay you should consider getting it or deff get it discounted at a dvd store that might have it used. I've gotten TNA dvds dirt cheap at used dvd stores. The Monty Brown and Cage match made it a must own for me. There were plenty of other great supporting matches but truth be told it's not the greatest TNA PPV of 2006.

  2006 was an exciting and great year for TNA with the return of Sting and the free agent signing of Kurt Angle and Christian Cage. This event helped prove Cage could carry the ball and was no midcard comedy act. He took the ball and ran with it and helped TNA reach new heights in 2006.",1420588800,,3498,4.1783060921248145
8317849,2,B001LEI7B8,"Jay Lethal vs. Alex Shelley - Great X division matchup between the two youngest members of the roster. You saw some unique moves between these two that you haven't seen in previous X division matches & the crowd was heavily into it so it's a great opener.

Lance Hoyt vs. Matt Bentley - This was just an above average match but it was nothing more than a background to Eric Young & Alex Shelley dropping flyers from the ceiling asking for Sting. Just a filler match.

Naturals vs. Team Canada (Bobby Roode & Eric Young) - Good tag team match between the two that went back & forth but nothing noteworthy.

James Gang & Bob Armstrong vs. L.A.X. - The tag match itself was just an average brawl as the story behind the match was Bob Armstrong getting his hands on Konnan which he eventually did. The match wasn't bad but disappointing when you know what Homicide is capable of.

Petey Williams vs. Chris Sabin vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Puma - This was an international X division four way that saw all different wrestling styles come together for a really good X division match. Really showcases what the X division is about outside of Daniels/Styles/Joe.

Rhino, Team 3D, Ron Killings vs. Jeff Jarrett, America's Most Wanted, Abyss - This was a wild eight man tag that just went all over the place & settled into a good tag team match. It doesn't match the six man tag at Genesis but it comes close.

Ultimate X Match: X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels - This Ultimate X match was short due to Joe already having an injury but the story here was Joe being set up for failure by being too heavy to grab the X and it worked out in the end. You didn't get the typical high spots off the cables that you would get in other Ultimate X matches which made this one unique but also somewhat disappointing & easily the weakest match out of the series between these three men.

NWA Champion Christian Cage vs. Monty Brown - Just like the flow of the PPV, this match was just above average as Monty Brown is limited in what he can do (he was also injured as well) & just isn't up to the level a main eventer should be. Christian did what he could do to carry Brown but it was just an average match & not the type of match that should be in a main event.

After the match was the highlight of the night when Steve Borden (Sting) came out to attack Jarrett's army, who was out to attack Christian, only to see the debut of Scott Steiner who attacked Sting & layed him out.

Bonus Section: Shark Boy & Norman Smiley vs. Diamonds In The Rough - Just basically a glorified squash match but the crowd was really into the team or Norman & Shark Boy which made it look like they might pull the upset win. For those wondering, this match was from the pre-show & TNA didn't put the pre-show on this DVD (like they've been doing with their other releases) because of a match featuring Shannon Moore beating Cassidy Riley but Moore ended up signing with WWE the next day & leaving the company.

Destination X wasn't one of the best showing of TNA when compared to the other PPV's in 2006 but it certainly wasn't the worst either. The show mostly came off as a 3 hour edition of Impact which just average matches with a few standouts here & there.  In the end, the best matches on this card were on other DVD's outside out of the opening match so this is one event that I would skip.",1278460800,,3458,4.320987654320987
