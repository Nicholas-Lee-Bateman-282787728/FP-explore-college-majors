8259071,3,B0015LPRRO,"This documentary concerns five Baby Boomer adults who are caring for their very elderly parents.  It wasn't showcasing people of my generation, but younger viewers would be prudent to watch this and think in the long-term.

The documentary is filmed in and around Providence, Rhode Island.  It's interesting to think of that place as an Any Town, USA in that it's not big, but it's not small.  Most people may assume that an East Coast town could not represent Middle America.  For those who have never heard Rhode Island accent, prepare to get a chuckle.  Still, one adult daughter got money from Rhode Island to care for her mother.  I doubt poorer or stingier states provide wonderful benefits like that.

The documentary tries to be diverse.  It includes elderly parents born in Appalachia, Portugal, and Colombia.  While the work shows mostly female caretakers helping elderly women, one male caretaker and some elderly fathers are filmed here.  Later a scholar explains that research says the care of the elderly almost always falls into the lap of an adult daughter.

In the past, adults had to have children because they needed workers on the farm and they needed adult children to care for them when they aged.  I thought Social Security, pensions, and other social safety nets opened the doors for people to not have children, but here we see that the very elderly would be terribly worse off without them.  Of course, I don't want to encourage the already high human overpopulations, but this work does make me fear for us childless adults.

One man ended getting divorced and having a pacemaker inserted into him as the stress of caring for his elderly parents took its toll on them.  The Baby Boomers here seem a nervous wreck and deserve much sympathy.  Still, I couldn't tell if the documentary makers were trying to make a tearjerker or it was just a coincidence.

The narrator says, ""Some of the adult children went to a conference on caregiving"" and then they proceed to show the conference's panel, practically in its entirety.  This makes me wonder if the point was to deliver viewers to the panel in the first place.  I wonder if this was two documentaries that just got glued together.

Viewers may want to see this alongside the documentary ""Living Old.""  Also, some viewers may feel that work is too long and moves to slowly.",1230076800,2,2349,4.791044776119403
