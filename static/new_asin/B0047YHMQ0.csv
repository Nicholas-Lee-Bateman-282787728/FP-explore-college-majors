8476761,1,B0047YHMQ0,"I purchased this to learn ProTools. First it's not a DVD that you can play on you TV. Second, instead of auto starting you find that it's in files to be opened. The one you need first is a file that you have to print out or read which instructs you to go to their web site and click on a file that contains videos to watch which they say is essential to the rest of the course but the one indicated is not there! I sent them an email to see what they have to say for themselves but it's really sucks when you buy something in order to learn something and right from the beginning they make it as hard as possible to get going.

Update: I went through the entire disk. There is absolutely nothing on this disk that gets you started with ProTools. Total waste of money.",1371340800,2,767,4.079470198675497
