8582723,5,B00CJN84F4,"It is perfectly directed for the 9 month early beginner. the music is slow, the letters are introduced with color and slowly, so the baby can visually adjust to what they see. The alphabet is divided into smaller segments, which work well for younger ones. A word is spelled out and a picture develops slowly for the learners as they get older.
