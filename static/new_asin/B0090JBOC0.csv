5204590,4,B0090JBOC0,"I enjoyed this film, I am a big fan of action adventures. However, great for video; I am not sure it will do very well in theater viewing. Great actors are in this film and do well.",1355097600,3,181,3.918918918918919
5204591,5,B0090JBOC0,"I enjoyed the movie, the three actors who played brothers had chemistry and there were scenes that were down right funny as hell. The movie did play off the old B-movies with the over-the-top killers sent to get the boy back from the brothers.  Michael Rappaport is awesome in his cameo, don't see what they needed Zoe Bell for as they didn't really give her much to do.  I suppose it was so they could attach her name to the cast.

The movie sorta leads you to believe there will be a sequel, and as long as they keep the three actors playing the brothers I would be in line to watch a sequel. The wardrobe and costume department did an amazing job of making three very attractive guys look like southern white trash...but with all their teeth.  Of course, if they allowed Lincoln to show a bit more skin I wouldn't complain either.",1355097600,7,833,4.3896103896103895
5204592,5,B0090JBOC0,"I thought this was a great movie, funny and action packed! We have been waiting for it to come to theaters so we were pretty excited to be able to watch it on amazon!",1355011200,4,166,3.911764705882353
5204593,5,B0090JBOC0,"The Oodie brothers are three redneck hitmen living near Montgomery Alabama. They are in cahoots with the local sheriff (Andre Braugher). When Celeste (Eva Longoria) offers them $25,000 to retrieve her godson (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) from crime boss Carlos (Billy Bob Thornton) they free lance.

The boys are Brick, the leader (Clayne Crawford); McQueen, nearly illiterate (Travis Fimmel) and Lincoln aka The Dixie Reaper (Daniel Cudmore). Carlos is the ""Wal- f@#$ing Mart of crime."" Once the godson is taken, he sends out gangs to retrieve him, including a gang of biker prostitutes. Meanwhile the sheriff is being hounded by a ""Yankee ATF"" (Paul Wesley) who is putting the pieces together.

This is a great shoot 'em grindhouse film. If you are not a grindhouse action fan, then don't bother with this film. This production includes colorful characters, a great soundtrack, and an improbable plot...everything we want in a grindhouse except Danny Trejo.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, brief rear nudity, brief sex on a video.",1355011200,32,1021,5.290123456790123

5204745,5,B0090JBOC0,"Great movie.  It's like the boondock saints if they were Tucker and Dale from Tucker and Dale vs. Evil. Really funny and action packed, but its a little silly at times and definitely  not for the easily offended. I would definitely recommend it. Since I've seen it, I've let several friends and family members watch it and no one's had anything negative to say. Very under-rated movie with a great cast",1517702400,,402,4.647887323943662
5204806,4,B0090JBOC0,"This was a good movie.  I thought at first it was going to be a tarantino blood bath, but it turned out to be a sort of more straight foward movie about three guys who are low life rednecks and get a deal they can't refuse to retrieve an attractive woman's (Eva Longoria) godson.  The main characters were pretty good actors and their characters were very likeable, but yet still realistic.  I liked this movie a lot, it is definitely worth the time I spent watching it.

5204879,4,B0090JBOC0,"Very entertaining film. With a few tweaks, I think it would have done big box office. Poorly titled but is essentially a low grit grindhouse chase film. It reminded me of The Great Texas Dynamite Chase and The Warriors as well as Smokin' Aces. There are some very clever one liners scattered throughout, maybe too clever because you really have to pay attention to catch them. Great performances with the possible exception of BBT and maybe Travis Fimmel (everytime he was onscreen, all I could see was Ragnar). Andre Braugher did a fine job but was horribly miscast. The film did capture deep-south redneck culture pretty well. Y'all come back now, ya hear?",1508716800,,658,4.831858407079646
5204880,5,B0090JBOC0,Clayne Crawford is great. I am shocked that Hollywood actually cast a REAL good ole' boy to play in a feature film. I am so sick of Californians doing there best southern white trash accent.,1508284800,,190,4.457142857142857

I checked it out because of of Billy Bob and because you can watch it for free on prime, then I saw good old Ragnar aka Travis Fimmel got excited and decided to keep watching. Glad I did, its your typical crime shoot em up, nothing special about the storyline but it was entertaining and I  liked it.  It had its funny parts and even some heart warming parts.

All the characters were phenomenal, and you get enough back story so that you can appreciate pretty much all of them...  Then you add the quasi-""Smokin Ace's"" style action in there, little comedy, and it's GREAT.

I think people that gave it one or two stars went in with skewed expectations, like wanting ""likeable"" characters.  This is not a rom com.  It's unadulterated action porn.

5204993,1,B0090JBOC0,"Unfortunately, this is not Hamlet, where all the main characters die at the end. There is not one likeable character in the entire movie. In fact, the only character who has any morals is punished for it, as is the audience or person viewing this idiotic yarn about idiotic criminals. A weak effort to ply some sympathy of the audience for these morons and scoundrels fails as does the reason to watch this poor excuse for a film. I will flog myself with branches now for watching it, no matter that I skipped over a few spots. The dashed hope of finding redeeming value in this film has caused life-long damage to my soul. Its grind house style of movie fare was meant to be forgotten at the bottom of the dollar rack in Caldor's, and should have disappeared along with the store.",1490659200,,781,4.468531468531468

Put it on the shelf for a while and then watch it over and over again until I get sick of watching it the second time around.

5205098,4,B0090JBOC0,Really enjoyed and excited to watch after finding out it was filmed at a motel owned by someone I knew. Also I lived near the area where it was filmed.,1485993600,,151,4.066666666666666
5205099,5,B0090JBOC0,"There aren't a lot of films that make me want to have repeated viewings. I own the ones that do, and the vast majority of them are Keanu Reeves films, as well as a few classics, like Jaws, Ferris Beullers Day Off, etc. I love it when I see a film for the first time and laugh so hard that my stomach hurts. I love it when I keep re-playing scenes from the film in my head, over and over. Films like that are hard to come by (for me, anyways.)

The Baytown Outlaws is such a film. Never before have I laughed so hard at the vulgarities, and even the violence, of 3 Southern redneck brothers (you know you're in for a fun ride when they burst into a house thats full of bad guy drug dealers and kill every last one of them, only to find out they got the wrong house.) I have met and known men like these in my personal life (sans the violence, thank God,) but the Oodie brothers make me want to go to Alabamas back country and find more.

The film centers on the Oodie boys. The eldest, Brick (Clayne Crawford,) Lincoln (Daniel Cudmore,) & McQueen (Travis Fimmel.) They are the not-so-hired guns of the local sheriff (Andre Braugher) who uses them to kill all of the other criminals in the county. They gleefully blow other bad guys away, the sheriff turns a blind eye, and his county ends up with the lowest crime rate in the state of Alabama.

Enter Celeste (Eva Longoria.) She wants to hire the boys to kidnap her godson Rob back from her crazy ex-husband Carlos (Billy Bob Thornton.) She offers $25,000 to the mostly cash-strapped boys, and the lure of such big money proves too much, so they agree to do the job, in a true smash and grab style.

Come to find out, Rob (wonderfully played by Thomas Brodie-Sangster) is confined to a wheelchair, unable to speak. We never know what condition he suffers from, but his disability somewhat disappears from our minds because he is treated as an equal by the boys. They don't talk down to him, and McQueen is highly reprimanded by Brick during the one and only time that he mimics Robs disability (we later learn that there was a 4th Oodie boy who had been born with a disability and who used a wheelchair, but who died before McQueen could remember him; Rob reminds Brick of this deceased brother that wasn't even given a name.)

Unbeknownst to the boys, Carlos has sent a fleet of other bad-guy assassins to get Rob back (they later learn that Carlos didn't die in their initial smash and grab fiasco, but pretty much everyone else gets shot up in the joint (including the maid, whom McQueen accidentally kills; he apologizes to her corpse, adding in my defense, you do work for an a**hole.) And let me say that these are not just regular assassins; they're equal-opportunity assassins (he sends out women on motorcycles, black dudes in a Road Warrior-type monstrosity, and Native Americans; everyone, it seems, gets to be a bad guy in the same film. Loved it.)

Everything comes to a head at an abandoned campground where the guns blaze and the arrows (yes, arrows) fly. In the end, we see that the boys have bigger hearts (and minds) than they let on, and they will literally fight to the death to protect one another, as well as Rob, whom they have made an honorary Oodie.

This film is like a redneck version of The Boondock Saints, another fantastic vigilante film. We have men doing very, very bad things for decent reasons, and youd think that the men would be as bad as their actions, but thats not always the case, especially with my now-beloved Oodie brothers.

Directed by Barry Battles, the film keeps a great pace and doesnt really slag too much (the scenes with Carlos are sometimes a bit tedious, as are the scenes with the ATF agent (played by Paul Wesley) and the sheriff. But the dialogue is just good enough to make you forget the pacing flaws (viewers of The Vampire Diaries will be happy to see Wesley in a different role, but all I kept thinking was man, Stefan Salvatore sure has got a potty mouth on him. LOL)

The film has a fantastic soundtrack, full of great classic and modern Southern-ish rock (and even an old time Gospel song thrown in for good measure.) I enjoyed collecting the songs on YouTube and listening to them in their entirety. And yes, there is a Skynyrd song in there, and no, its not the one you think.

There are so many funny moments and lines in the film; there are too many to list here. One of my personal highlights is a chase down the highway with the Road Warrior-ish truck, guns blazing, and they pass a cop car. The one cop turns on the siren, but the other one in the drivers seat turns it off with a resounding nono, indeed, hell no. The actors one line in the whole film, and the way he delivers it makes me laugh the hardest.

There are countless funny lines in the film, but if you get easily offended at derogatory slur words describing gay people & people with disabilities, you may cringe during the viewing. However, if you consider the way most brothers talk to each other (redneck or not,) it kind of makes sense. Personally, I find those particular words deplorable and insulting, but it comes out of the mouths of many types of people, and this film reflects that.

With few exceptions, all of the actors give fantastic performances. I loved how Travis Fimmel makes McQueen so very lovable, even though hed just as quickly shoot you in the face if you looked at him funny. I especially loved the bond that occurs between him and Rob; he talks to Rob as an equal, and treats him as such. On the same hand, we see Rob having what is undoubtedly the time of his life; the smiles that appear on his face tell the tale of a boy who seems to come to life during his time with the Oodies.

In a wordless role, Daniel Cudmore does a fine job as Lincoln, the seemingly indestructible middle Oodie who, because of a crushed voice box, cant speak words, but speaks volumes with his eyes (and his trusty Speak & Spell-type gadget.)

The films poster highlights Billy Bob Thornton & Eva Longoria, no doubt because they are the most well-known actors in the film, but make no mistake about it, this film, without a doubt, belongs to Clayne Crawford. He shines in his role as Brick, the eldest Oodie brother that knows who he is (an ignorant redneck) and seems to have no qualms about it. We see that hes way more than that, however; hes more intelligent than he lets on, and if you look deep enough, you see that he does, in fact, have a heart. He loves his brothers and comes to care about Rob, as well, if only because Rob reminds him of the lost Oodie boy that had no name.

The gleeful joy he takes in blowing away the bad guys in the opening scenes is evident, and as he sits and patronizes the dying man hes just shot, the racist garbage that comes out of his mouth is ever-so-slightly lightened by the way he delivers the lines. And when McQueen informs him that they got the wrong house, the look on his face is utterly priceless. And all he can say is aint that some s#!%. This is just one of many fantastic scenes that Crawford has; he is absolute perfection as Brick. Thankfully, Crawford, who now plays Riggs on the FOX TV show Lethal Weapon, is getting a bit more attention these days. People are seeing what a fantastic actor he is. I have seen almost all of his work (he was wonderful as Teddy in the Sundance Channels now-gone Rectify) and I am looking forward to his future projects, among them Tinker, which also stars another one of my faves, Christian Kane ( on a little side note, Christian Kane was originally slated to play McQueen, but a scheduling conflict kept him from the role; he did, however, play McQueen in the Baytown Disco short, which led to the actual full-length film.)

I think Clayne Crawford is one of the finest American actors working today, and all one has to do is watch The Baytown Outlaws once, and that will become very evident.

The Baytown Outlaws is a very violent film with tons of profanity, but it is also one of the funniest, well-written and well-acted films out there. It has a good heart, as well, and very unexpected tender moments at just the right time. I highly recommend this movie. I personally consider it a classic, and I truly hope a sequel is made (pay attention to the closing credits; its left open for one.)",1485907200,,8278,4.421259842519685

Yes it is an action movie, and as one would expect, there is violence a plenty. Nicely mixed in comedic moments. Barry Battles and Griffin Hood created a decent story and script, and Battles did a good job in his directing debut. There were no extraordinarily weak performances by any of the actors in primary roles, and a few were very good, including Billy Bob Thornton as Carlos and Andre Braugher as Sheriff Millard. Clayne Crawford, Travis Fimmel, and Daniel Cudmore were also good in their roles as the Oodie brothers.",1470441600,,642,4.845454545454546

5206483,4,B0090JBOC0,"All in all, I liked the film. It had some simply silly stuff, but it also had lots of action and lots of humor, and we got to like the bad guys, but not the really bad guys. A sheriff paid three brothers to clean up crimes by shooting and killing the really bad guys. As a result, his county had a very low crime rate.
A woman saw them in action and hired them to rescue her god-son from her ex-husband who had his gang shoot her three times, left her for dead, and took the disabled god-son. We are not told until near the end of the story why he did it. The three are involved in many gun fights against overwhelming odds. They get shot up, cut up, and beat up. The way they fight is different and often humorous. One of the three is unable to talk, and the god-son is also unable to talk.
I would have given the film five stars, but deleted one because of the silliness that I thought was not funny. It is worth seeing.",1469318400,,922,4.016304347826087

5206731,4,B0090JBOC0,I really like this movie. It is fun! Zo Bell's butt was worth the price of admission. Violent but lighthearted. Fast paced but easy to follow. Billy Bob Thornton and Eva Longoria were funny and evil. The three brothers and the hit-chicks are pure entertainment and Andre Braugher gave a great performance. Loved it. Gave it four stars instead of five because it is campy and may not be as enthusiastically embraced by everyone.,1468540800,,427,4.783783783783784

5207565,1,B0090JBOC0,"Appalling shameful movie that is also derivative, deeply uninspired and mediocre. The ""good guys"" are hired killers whose father was a notorious klansman, and one of them wears a rebel flag throughout the movie. They kill loads of ""bad guys"" who are Native Americans, Latinos, African-Americans and women. A northern cop (they call him a Yankee) chases after these dubious heroes and catches them and their mentor...and of course the movie punishes him for that. In an attempt to try and disguise the off color aspects of this movie there's some thin camo thrown on the story via casting and several characters that lightly buck the trend. It doesn't work unless you want it to. In the end it portrays violent gun-toting southern white men of racist lineage as the heroes and most everyone else as villains to be gleefully slaughtered.",1466294400,,835,4.929078014184397

5208505,4,B0090JBOC0,"This is definitely not a morality play, yet the storyline has a certain moral flavor to it -- along with a HEAP of violence. There's plenty of action, for those so inclined, but there's some interesting (and unexpected) character development as well. Other than Rob (the young victim contended for by two waring factions), just about every character in this movie has villainous qualities. They varying degree, rather than direction.

I picked this movie as my choice for my most recent Trash Movie Night. TMN means that my wife is off to Bunco, so I have a free evening to indulge in Chinese takeout and a movie that most civilized folks would probably prefer to burn rather than watch. I wasn't expecting much. butI ended up enjoying the story. It's not a cult classic, but it's worth four stars. THAT surprised me.

Then again, it does have Billy Bob Thornton portraying a main character. His name in the promo was enough to tip me in favor of trying this flick. I consistently appreciate his on-screen efforts.

I won't stand in line to see the sequel (there may not be one, but the ending is a setup such), but I will watch it on Prime if it comes along.",1465257600,,1159,4.5625

The cast is fantastic. You get Billy Bob, Eva Langoria, Travis Fimmel (Ragnar from Vikings) and many other notable actors. Gangs of bikers, American Indians, Nubians and a hooker gang all take their shot at attacking these three tough as nails rednecks who are protecting a disabled boy being used by a drug lord.

I could've done without some of the red neck stereotypes but I watched it all for the fun of it.  Billy Bob was not in it as much as I thought he would be but the actor from Vikings was a nice addition.  I will watch some actors and not others who get real political and these guys haven't gone over the line with their political minds and thats nice for a change.  Give me some guns and hot ladies and Im half way there at least.  Travis Fimmel could've been more prominent but he's getting more roles.  Used to be referred to as the guy looks like the SOA Jax.  After Vikings, he's pulling free of his shadow.  Good over all movie.  Eva Langoria is not real impressive, kind of like her off camera personality, but the guys take care of business anyway.  Her, despite her body, I could do without.  Realistically if a strange female showed at a club house blabbing about a capital crime like her they'd have dealt with her immediately and strongly, not listening to her personal issues.

5210263,1,B0090JBOC0,"What can you say about an exploitation flick so bad that even Danny Trejo refused to appear in it?

I couldn't figure out if the guy that made this was copying Taratino or the Farley brothers or Robert Rodriguez because he outright ripped off the key elements of all of them but I know one thing...he failed epically.  The only aspect of this movie that was more offensive than the outright theft of concept was the tragic fact that Thornton and Longoria's careers have decayed subliminally to a point well past rigor mortus and directly to the point of complete. dung pile decomposition.  Their roles in this movies were little more than cameos and one has to assume that both of them must be on the verge of bankruptcy to allow their names to be associated with this ""direct to dumpster"" trash.

The sole positive note is that this movie is so horridly conceived, produced, directed and acted that it has unintended comic value...the same kind of comic value as watching a train wreck or a plane crash with no survivors.  Or like the career of Eva Longoria.",1463961600,3,1059,4.611702127659575

It's loud, its obnoxious, it's crazy violent, and it doesn't always make sense, but this tale of three ""loser"" brothers, and the boy they're paid to kidnap/rescue, is one hell of a fun ride. Frankly, I'm shocked it couldn't find a distributor for a big release.

Girl gangs, black gangs, American Indian games, drug dealers, small town sheriffs, big city FBI agents, mutes, and overly attractive killers...this movie has it all. You won't want to miss it.

Right at the end, it probably could have used a better edit, but they fixed it, before the credits were done rolling. Even with that slight, very slight, drawback, I give it a heart thumbs up.",1463961600,5,866,4.877551020408164

It was a quite campy and there were only a few points I thought were very funny and the language was excessively offensive and I don't know why everyone is so infatuated with Billy Bob he was an unnecessary character in this movie.

Too much improbability and an inconsistent story. There's no way these guys could've survived and the other hitman were better armed, had better vehicles, and appeared to be better trained yet died off like they were elementary school kids. The story was set up that the main characters were  intelligent professional hitman but there were a lot of points in this movie proved otherwise.

If the guys are so smart then why did they get the wrong house? If the guys are so smart why are they shooting an armored truck and not at the bad guys?

The opening credits annoyed me to no end and I thought ""this better not continue throughout the movie"" and it only happened 1 other time, which was forgivable considering when and how it was done.

Without giving much more away, I'd have to say that it was a fun ride from start to finish and I was glad that I watched it.  I may even rewatch it again at some point (which is a good thing from me considering I will rarely rewatch a movie).  This falls under the same category as Tucker and Dale VS. Evil for me: found something random, clicked on it and was glad that I did.

The reason why I only gave it 4 instead of 5 is due to the somewhat predictable nature of the movie at times.

5210954,4,B0090JBOC0,"Good action movie. Entertaining and fun with a surprisingly good script and excellent acting. Everything over-the-top, except the dialogue and humor...which is so lacking in a lot of movies.

But, during the entire movie, I couldn't help but thinking that someone has spent a LOT of time watching Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez movies and approaches to Grindhouse-style cinema. That's not necessarily a bad thing but it did take away from the experience just a bit. In fact, I stopped the movie a couple times. First, to see if either of them had any hand in the producing/creation of the movie. And, second, to see if the director had any affiliation/working relationship with them. Even the actress (and I use that term loosely because she is awful in every movie she appears) appeared in Tarantino's Death Proof.

The irony is that, upon looking up ""Barry Battles"" an article popped up about how Tarantino is so maligned because of his copying of previous styles. And that Battles shouldn't be criticized for doing the same with QT movies.

OK, fair enough. But the similarities are striking and it's the only reason I didn't give this one 5 stars. But it's definitely one of the better movies I've viewed since being an Amazon Prime member.",1463443200,,1252,4.89622641509434

This movie is sorta like Dale and Tucker vs Evil.  Absurd, but hilarious!  Eva isn't in it much, it is really about some crazy southern boys who are really good at killin'. They were friendly, funny, crazy, in a way that made the movie worth watching.  I'll probably watch it again, to see some of the things that were missed the first time around.

Imagine 3 ""Dexters"" (psychopaths of sorts), except here Dexter is a Redneck.  Too funny.  There are so many stereotypes that are demolished and destroyed by this movie it should get an award.  Humor is not sacrificed for Political Correctness.  So many bad Action movies out there today, at least this one doesn't pretend to be something it isn't.  How many action movies do we see where a single punch just happens to knock out that one guard, so the hero or heroin can pass by them.  In other scenes of these bad action flicks the people will fight for seemingly hours, but when it is needed for the plot to continue--one punch-- and the inept guard is knocked out.  For me that can ruin a hole movie, especially a movie that pretends to be serious and real life.  The Baytown Outlaws won't disappoint like those phony bad action movies because tt embraces its pretentiousness, and thus comes off funny, dark, sensitive and at times poignant.",1463097600,2,1106,4.6020408163265305

Complements to the writers, screen play writers and the director for putting this together so nice.  Usually, when you see a collection of supporting actors as such; the storyline suffers as parts are written for them other than the other way around. If you like Vikings, Smokin' Aces, Kill Bill and or Rectify then you will love these actors and story themes.  Reminds me of Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino.",1462838400,,556,4.882978723404255

5211801,5,B0090JBOC0,"This movie has sex, violence and heart-a surprising combination. Clayne Crawford, Daniel Cudmore, and Travis Fimmel  play three red neck  brothers hired to rescue a disabled teen boy. All three men are highly effective in parts that would have been pure farce in the hands of less talented actors.
For me, the best thing about this movie is that it played against stereotypes. Not all White Southerners are evil and stupid. Not all minorities and women are noble and heroic. The movie confounds the bigotry of political correctness without losing entertainment value. Wow! Imagine that!!!",1462838400,,588,5.178947368421053

Are there deep, intricate plot twists and broad character-developing world events? Sure, it's a compelling road trip narrative laced with manifestation of abandonment issues.... no of course it doesn't have any of those things. Okay, wait, there is a road trip involved, but that's it. It's a pure and simple violent romp through a basic story line that ends up providing a good dose of action and even humor.

It has been compared to a Tarantino movie, but I think it's better because of the humor and storyline. I'm sure it was created by a Tarantino fan, but this actually made some sense, where his movies rarely do. My biggest concern is being turned on by the hillbilly brother's. I don't think that speaks well concerning my character. ;) Best soundtrack I've heard in year's!!
For those who claim it's racist and stereotypical, you clearly didn't pay enough attention and should watch it again. I'm not racist and find these comments to be extremely offensive. No race was off limits...ie the hillbillies who were raised by an African-American. Lighten up and learn to see the humor in not being so politically correct all the time. It is a movie!!!

It's fairly obvious that Carlos doesn't want Rob gone as he's worth a lot of money.

There is one downfall and it belongs to Amazon for not having subtitles available.  There is far too much dialog lost in sound.

Don't tell me the director was not influenced by Quentin, you don't cast Zoe Bell for her amazing acting chops.

It is a real shame, because the central performances are so strong.  My advice filmmaker, stop trying to be something that you are not.  Be yourself and keep it simple.",1461974400,,620,4.820754716981132

5212139,5,B0090JBOC0,"I meant to see this when it came out but finally got around to it and boy am I glad I did. The plot is simple in that three backwoods brothers - who can handle them selves and their guns, are hired by a woman wronged. She wants them to get her son back from his step father; this is the exquisitely nasty Carlos - played to perfection by Billy-Bob Thornton.

The three are McQueen, Brick and Lincoln. McQueen is played by Travis Fimmel from Amazon's TV series `Vikings' playing a much more down to earth role here but still sporting a fair degree of facial hair. Anyway they set off in a beat up old car and think it has to be an easy gig. The problem is Carlos is really well connected and so he sends a veritable smorgasbord of baddies after them and they have to take on all comers, protect the kid and not run out of ammo. It has echoes of `The Warriors' in that respect but has its feet firmly placed in the over acting comedy genre.

There are the cops too and all is never as it seems. I found this a complete joy from start to finish. They balance the humour with the action, the violence can be full on but I never felt this was gratuitous and it keeps you guessing right till the end. A film that I find very easy to recommend.",1423872000,,1237,4.08641975308642

I found this to be more fun than almost any Tarantino film except Pulp fiction I put it on par with the great reservoir dogs it has a broad emotional playing field As did both aforementioned films that ability that creates a connection with the characters fun violent and way over the top . This films starts right out of the gate and never lets go. It has a few flaws but nothing to distract much . This film was a crazy joyride following an assortment of oddball characters biker hookers and redneck killers among them.
Much more in common with Robert Rodriguez early films like el mariachi. A Shootem up over the top quirky that will oddly enough involve you the viewer . I will go no further because the less you know the more fun you will gave",1399939200,,779,4.3061224489795915

Eva Longoria and BIlly Bob Thornton are reduced to phone call duty, as these 3 guys take center stage in this action pckeed adventure. These High Way Wars, seemed t go on by noticed, except dieting the war wagon and the outlaws where the young cop went to turn on his syrins and the old cop says not today and put his hand over the button).

5212184,2,B0090JBOC0,"This was a tough one to rate as the reality is at the bottom whereas the filming and action is pretty good. The premise of  indestructible outlaws is too much fantasy for me. My rating is close to a 1 star. However, with a little imagination I could see where the 5 star ratings come from. But, brutality, silliness does not make for so many 5 star ratings. Being on the conservative side I do enjoy the idea that this movie would drive liberals nuts. So I give it 5 stars for the red neck portrayal of doing the wrong things for the right reason. The premise that 3 guys can take on gang after gang and win the fights but lose the war is not conducive to my liking. I bought the video because of so many 5 star ratings. I am giving it away to my good redneck friends. In a nutshell three rednecks are hired to kidnap a stepson of Eva Langoria from Billie Bob Thorton because the kid has a fortune inheritance. They do it excitingly.",1396483200,,933,4.183333333333334

5212186,5,B0090JBOC0,Funny action filled movie with many twists. Billy Bob Thornton was my reason for purchasing this movie but he played a minor role. The supporting cast  were the main characters and carried the movie quite well,1395532800,,209,4.805555555555555
5212187,5,B0090JBOC0,"I've seen this DVD twice in the past two weeks and it just keeps getting better. The best way to describe it is to say its an old drive-in movie on steroids. Everything about it is just plain fun, including themed biker gangs and three anti-heroes who are both disgusting and lovable at the same time. I wish they'd make a sequel. And bravo to the film maker for having southern accents that are believable.",1395014400,,407,4.44
5212188,5,B0090JBOC0,"This will probably be one of Billy Bob Thornton's final films as he has stated publicly that he is pretty much done with making films at this time in his life. I'm sorry to see him retire, but he certainly has left us with a wonderful legacy of films that are ""a little different"" than the usual fare. This is one of those films.

There's a lot of violence in this film, right from the start, but it isn't gratuitous violence. The seemingly obvious plot soon reveals some very unexpected twists and surprises, which is great fun. Thornton isn't one of the main characters, but he is certainly unforgettable as a murderous, power-hungry tycoon who has diverse groups of thugs at his beck and call.

The real stars of the film are the seemingly rotten-to-the-core brothers who will do anything for money. They set out to do a high-paying job for Thornton, but they are transformed when they learn the job is the kidnapping of a young man who has severe mental and physical disabilities. This transformation is great to watch. Don't get me wrong, the movie doesn't turn mushy as the carnage keeps things rolling at the pace of a roller coaster.

The acting is excellent, as is the script. I saw this without having any idea what it was about, just looking for another good Thornton film ... and I definitely found one here. I ended up buying it as well.",1393459200,5,1350,4.5473251028806585

5212191,5,B0090JBOC0,"This movie is a gem that I rented and then had to own on Blu-ray. It's better than it has any right to be by looking at the formula. If you like movies like Pulp Fiction and The Boondock Saints then you'll probably love it. It's definitely a grind house type of movie but as the writer said, he wanted to make a fun to watch movie with engaging characters and he COMPLETELY succeeded!!! This is definitely one that I would love to see a sequel to if it could be as much fun as the first.",1391040000,,487,4.030927835051546

5212197,4,B0090JBOC0,"A quiet and fun movie, not too heavy on the T & A but with copious amounts of enjoyable absurdity. Full of stereotypes twisted in a back-world rednecks meets Mad Max story, this is more like an absurdist 70s action flick than anything else I have seen in a while. It is stupid, verbally raunchy and incredibly violent in all of the best ways. It is kind of like a Rob Zombie film made for a cable market who had just enough money to get a few good names. See it knowing what it is going into it.",1379203200,,495,4.061224489795919

Three more words required for this review.",1379030400,,151,5.291666666666667
5212199,3,B0090JBOC0,"A mysterious woman Celeste (Eva Longoria) hires three redneck outlaw brothers Brick (Clayne Crawford), Lincoln (Daniel Cudmore) and McQueen Oodie (Travis Fimmel) to rescue her kidnapped godson Rob (Thomas Brodie-Sangster). And she pays 5,000 dollars up front. The Oodie brothers, running out of money, are ready to accept. The problem is, though they are able to get the boy, an army of hired thugs stand in the way before their mission is completely over.

""The Baytown Outlaws"" directed and co-written by Barry Battles (his feature debut) starts out promisingly. And you know, the villain is played by always reliable Billy Bob Thornton. Sadly, the role doesn't give him much to work on. The same can be said about the character played by Zo Bell, though both players are doing their best. Eva Longoria doesn't have much to do.

The film's bloody and over-the-top shoot-outs didn't bother me much. Neither did the stereotypical descriptions of the characters, which I think is intentional. Some may compare this with Tarantino and ""Mad Max"" movies. I am not sure the comparison is valid; violent as they are, directors like Quentin Tarantino and George Miller have distinct styles in dialogue and action, which are missing in ""The Baytown Outlaws."" In fact, ""The Baytown Outlaws"" takes itself too seriously in its final act, posing philosophical questions which few of us would be interested in.

With a weak subplot about a local sheriff (Andre Braugher) and an ATF agent (Paul Wesley), ""The Baytown Outlaws"" slowly loses its steam despite several interesting oddball characters. The movie is enjoyable, but it could have been more so with a better script.",1378684800,,1659,5.114391143911439
5212200,5,B0090JBOC0,"This movie was suggested to me by amazon. When I looked up the reviews comparing the storyline to that of The Tremors from Smokin' Aces I was intrigued. I looked up the trailer and gave it a shot. Turns out it's a great movie that didn't get a lot of attention. It's a little bit Smokin' Aces, a little bit Death Race, and a whole lot of funny. I'm glad I bought it, (I even bought a digital copy), and will be lending it out to my friends.",1377129600,,440,4.011363636363637

Travis Fimmel (Vikings), Daniel Cudmore (Twilight) & Clayne Crawford (Justified) play a set of brothers who are outlaws/vigilante  who work to 'take out the trash'. These brothers are on the other side of the criminal line, but you can't help but fall in love with them and follow them throughout the movie. It reminds me of an action/drama/comedy/Guy-Ritchie-type-filming movie. DEFINITELY worth the buy! (Just beware though, there is guns, violence and lots of cursing!)",1371945600,,609,5.09

Sure you can poke holes in the plot, sure you can complain aout this or that with the acting and storyline, but if you stop over thinking it, you'll find yourself cheering for the Brothers and hoping they survive every pitfall.

These brothers are just plain fun to watch as they get in and out of trouble trying to do good by rescuing this boy from drug kingpin Billy Bob. I promise if most people will just watch the first ten minutes of this movie they will be hooked.  I rented it but I plan on buying it now because its one of those movies where you just pop it in the DVD player on a bad day and it makes everything better.

There are prostitute biker/assassins, a couple of road warrior-types, and even an ""Indian"" chase. It also contains a lot of guns shooting and blood.

I would have expected more content or involvement out of Billy Bob Thornton, but the movie was worth the excitement. The story also has its warm moments centered around Rob and the three outlaws, the very likable Oodie brothers.

It's sad, funny, cool, edgy, very witty and filled with Southern culture and charm. The cinemotagraphy, acting, score, and stunts are all Oscar worthy, as far as I'm concerned. The 3 brothers are tough and cool, but also very sweet and compassionate. Billy Bob plays a wonderful villain- he's so funny!

And furthermore, I found the picture quality totally crap! I tried to watch this on 2 of my 3 BluRay players and found the picture too.... Deep? Thick? Rich? I don't know, it was just too much of an eye-sore.

5212226,5,B0090JBOC0,"I think I'm obsessed with this movie! First of all, it's Southern, which automatically gives it a boost in awesomeness. It says during one part that they're from ""the Atmore area near Montgomery, Alabama"" but anybody from down around here knows that Atmore is closer to Mobile or Pensacola than it is to Montgomery. Not to mention that the county is supposed to have the lowest crime rate in the state (due to the Oodie Brothers taking out the trash), and we all know that Montgomery County ain't gonna have the lowest crime rate! lol. But Southern is Southern, so I can deal with the geographical mistakes on a low-budget movie. I think it only bothered me since I live forty mile South of Atmore, I don't think anybody else even noticed it.
Brick, Lincoln, and McQueen definitely looked and acted like some crazy redneck boys from South Alabama. Whoever was in charge of costumes and hair stuff knew what they were doing, the Oodie Brothers were dang sexy! (: Actors had a lot of chemistry, you could almost believe that they were actually brothers, and the bond with Rob was real believable too.
Lots of action, guns, good music (Hank III, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Colt Ford), good-lookin' men (Clayne Crawford, Travis Fimmel, and whoever the heck played Lincoln... Vampire Diaries guy was cute too), and real funny. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, I'd recommend it to anybody, but Southerners (Gulf Coast are especially) will really love it.
I hope they make a sequel, like the ending kinda suggested... :D",1364860800,12,1523,4.7293233082706765

I saw this when it played in nyc, and CAN NOT WAIT to watch it again. Would highly recommend.",1364688000,2,330,4.253968253968254

5212230,5,B0090JBOC0,"Action fans can't go wrong with Baytown Outlaws. It follows three redneck mercenaries who are hired to rescue a handicapped boy from a crime boss and the aftermath that follows. Baytown Outlaws was hilarious, and the action was fantastic.

A lot of the movie is certainly written with camp in mind, but the direction keeps it far from just a parody of either higher budget action movies or older, low budget cult films. Baytown Outlaws comes out as its own beast, and a glorious beast at that.

The action is good, helped out by a stellar soundtrack, and paced appropriately. Each shoot-out, chase, or brawl also had its own feel as the plot moved on, so the movie never got stale.

What I wasn't expecting after viewing the trailer, was that the comedy would be so well-timed and acted, and that the trailer didn't give me every single highlight of the film. The three main actors did a magnificent job, and had perfect delivery. The jokes remained natural to the characters as well, never reaching too far into turning the movie into just a zany, unbelievable mess.

Overall what could have been another in a long string of knock off action flicks brings us a stellar cast and good direction, creating its own flair and standing well above others in the low budget genre.",1364083200,2,1273,4.669642857142857
5212231,4,B0090JBOC0,"I rented this at a kiosk as just something to watch that I haven't seen the other day.  I figured it was going to be the typical low budget quick b-movie rental cash grab.  Oddly enough this movie was fairly well done.  It wasn't high budget but it didn't feel low budget either.

Good acting all around, excellent action, and the typical muddled action plot (which is okay because it's pretty much convention to have a plot that doesn't really make sense in an action movie).  It's basically a movie that does what it's supposed to do (be watchable and fairly entertaining) and does it well.

Worth a watch if you don't expect oscar worthy plot lines, dialog, and acting from an action movie.  It has a bunch of notable actors in (somewhat) limited roles.  Not sure how they could afford these actors though (looking it up) this movie cost $4,000,000 to make (apparently).  Doesn't look or feel that way.",1363478400,3,905,4.60625
5212232,4,B0090JBOC0,"This totally exceeded by expectations. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's a little cheesy, but that's what a great southern fried shoot em up movie needs. To me this ranks up there with all the other movies of it's kind...Walking Tall, Gator, Smokey and the Bandit, etc.

Definately recommend!",1362787200,4,296,5.040816326530612
5212233,5,B0090JBOC0,"I just finished watching this movie & felt compelled to right a review of it.

I rented this expecting to see a stereotypical grindhouse flick.  I was wrong & can admit it!  Lol.  I was very surprised.  This movie was at least 10 times better than I expected.  Lots of laughs.

Loved how the three Oodie brothers took care of Rob and loved him like a brother.  The lengths they went to in order to protect him, was amazing.  The amount of compassion the brothers showed Rob, had me choked up a few times.

The profanity didn't bother me.  Almost no nudity in the movie.

This is a movie that needs to be seen to be appreciated.  It is beyond me how anyone cannot like this movie.

I rented & watched the movie...now I just put the DVD & Blu-ray discs in my Amazon shopping cart.

If you want to watch a good, surprising movie....watch this movie.",1362528000,35,846,4.2993630573248405

5212235,2,B0090JBOC0,"""If I can't have him no one can."" When Celeste (Longoria) wants to get her son back from her abusive ex Carlod (Thornton) she turns to three redneck brothers. Taking him back was easy, avoiding the odd gangs that are after them proves to be a little tougher. This is yet another movie where my expectations were apparently way to high. Also this is another movie where they put two big stars on the poster, but not really in the movie. They are in it more then Bruce Willis seems to be in his movies lately but they both did about 3 days of work each. Other then that the movie is a little boring. Really full of action and comedy but I had a hard time getting into this. I'm not sure what was missing because I usually like movies like this but I really couldn't get into this. Overall, I was very disappointed by this, was hoping for something more exciting. I give it a C+",1361318400,3,875,4.214285714285714

5212241,2,B0090JBOC0,"My wife begged me to go watch this movie with her in the theater as it has her favorite actor in it.  I watched the preview on YouTube and wasn't impressed but figured that it was better than having to watch another chick-flick.  When the movie was finished, I realized that I'd never get that hour and forty minutes back.  I also figured out that I was probably dumber having watched it.  Now, having said all that, the action sequences were pretty decent, and the majority of the acting was good.  So due to those two saving graces, it gets two stars.

Pretty unbelievable plot, and an amazing amount of tissue damage to three studs who can still wise-crack while bonding with a disabled boy, but it's all good fun (well, until somebody gets their guts blown out with a 12-gauge or gets their neck snapped). The throwaway lines are terrific if you can catch them. My favorite, while the ""boys"" are preparing for serious showdown: 'Brick': ""Maybe we should have finished school.""
