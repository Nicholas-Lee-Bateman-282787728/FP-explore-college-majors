8421967,4,B004BIEMH4,"After being out of tying for over a decade I decided to get back into it.  After a few unsuccessful attempts at a pattern that might have been too advanced for my atrophied skills, I bought this video.  Charlie is a great tier and gives very clear advice.  The fact that he ties left handed makes the view perfect for us right handers, yet the video has a left hand option for tiers who prefer tying the other way.  The video starts with simple patterns and allows you to build you skills with tougher patterns as you fill your fly box.  My only complaint is I wish he spent more time showing how to use tools like the whip finisher.  He seems to assume you have already taken a preliminary course, but you can always search the Internet to get step by step instructions on the skills he glosses over.",1378598400,,801,4.306666666666667
