I have no idea where this came from, but Todd Sheets produced it so I had to buy it. Must have been early in his career. He should have directed it as well. No gore, no anything really, but a good story and some really odd plot twists. Acting for the leads is good, but the rest is SOOOO bad.",982281600,,441,3.857142857142857
