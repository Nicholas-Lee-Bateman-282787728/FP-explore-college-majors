Each act is individualized in terms of what is happening (plot summary) and how the actions are to be interpreted (analysis).  Major points are written with key points highlighted in blue writing.

I use the RocketBook immediately after we have read an act or a scene.  Only then do I discuss the points highlighted from RocketBook, or I bring up impromptu questions that RocketBook did not cover.

The graphics are visually pleasing and very easy to follow.  Each clip runs about 7 mins--adequate time for a media ancillary in teaching.  Finally, each RocketBook comes with a PDF version for the teachers; this PDF teaching resource also provides questions to help assist with teaching.

Overall, this is a wonderful teaching tool!",1278460800,6,953,5.096774193548387
