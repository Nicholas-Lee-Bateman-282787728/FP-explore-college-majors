8457334,5,B005535DSQ,"This show speaks to your childhood nerd.  It's silly, quirky and hilarious. The songs are very entertaining, sometimes touching and will keep you humming for days.  The premise is a group of middle aged guys getting together to play a role playing game.  It then turns to them acting out the game...largely tongue in check and with nods to the audience.  Whether you played D&D in middle school, still play in your late 30s or never played at all, this is just a huge amount of fun to watch.",1424131200,2,491,4.48314606741573
