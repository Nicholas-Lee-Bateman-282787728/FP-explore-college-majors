8180780,3,B000NQQ1DQ,"This video isn't bad ... however, you could delete almost all of the section on Crowley lake ... who really cares about sitting in a boat and jigging nymphs off the bottom in a still deep-water cove?  Might as well be 2 - 12 year old kids drowning worms with a bobber!  The spot on Hot creek was good, but woefully short in both time and in fishing action, as the primary and most attractive stream in the area.  Shoud have also had a whole section on the Upper and Lower Owens, as well as some of the other waters / creeks in the area, rather than almost none at all.  And the back country fishing, while enjoyable and a little informative, could have been a lot better destinations than simply catching a bunch of 8 inch ""wild"" fish - those may be fun, but they're not a compelling reason to go.",1297296000,,797,4.223684210526316
