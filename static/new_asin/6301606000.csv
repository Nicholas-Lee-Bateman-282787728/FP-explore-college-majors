many of the details and truth of his death remain a mystery.",1395705600,,158,4.678571428571429
7813157,4,6301606000,"However you feel about Lifton's body-alteration theory, this video contains valuable filmed interviews (from circa 1980) with medical witnesses Dennis David, Aubrey Rike, Paul O'Connor, Jerrol Custer. There's no doubt that something fishy went on with JFK's autopsy, I'm just not sure what.",1386979200,,290,5.767441860465116
7813158,4,6301606000,"After reading the book Best Evidence I contacted the author and got a recommendation for this video. I am glad I saw it. I think it takes tremendous guts to dig up the dirt in this government and expose it. The book is very detailed and the most relevant parts of it are emphasized in the video. I recommend the revealing book by David S. Lifton as well as this video. It is all so disturbing.

Two sets of medical doctors see two different scenarios and the brain is missing from the cranium in one scenario. Not the typical autopsy in any respect. Look at the inconsistencies and try your hand at offering an explanation for them. Unfortunately no one seems to care anymore.

7813159,5,6301606000,"Lifton does an extraordinary job of juxtapositioning (sp?) what was seen in Dallas and what turned up for autopsy by interviewing the actual people who put JFK into his casket in Dallas or took him out in Bethesda.

Lifton presents his case clearly and in stark terms both in the interviews and in summary.

The looks on the faces of the parties he interviews are priceless when they realize that a shell game and a crime of conspiracy took place under their noses.",1195689600,4,465,4.590361445783133
7813160,5,6301606000,"The author notes that what you believe happened in Dallas on 11-22-63 depends on what evidence you believe. (Or what evidence you've been told to believe.) In courtrooms, juries are presented with conflicting evidence; they decide which evidence is credible. This is called the ""best evidence""; the jury decides the facts.

One question on the assassination is the discrepancy between the wounds recorded in Dallas (shots from the front), and the wounds recorded in Washington DC (shots from the rear). Lifton's book says ""surgery to the head"" occurred to change the evidence. But this would have to be quickly and expertly done. A simpler solution would be the use of a ""body double"", a replacement for the body of JFK that could be quickly switched. This would explain why the body in Washington was in a body bag while the body in Dallas was in a casket.

There is another way to test this theory. Some books contain the Washington DC autopsy photos. The pictures of the President show a thick faced JFK who looks like other 45-year olds. The face of the body in the autopsy appears about 30 years old, in my opinion. Look and see for yourself. If you agree, this proves a conspiracy in killing JFK. As others have pointed out, while one ""lone gunman"" can kill anyone, it takes a group of conspirators to cover it up for decades.",1145491200,7,1332,4.688034188034188
7813161,3,6301606000,"This video has not been updated or revised since it was released ten years ago--and that video was a reprint of interviews conducted by Lifton in the late '80s. Some of the material has been disproved, and, honestly, Mr. Lifton is not that engaging a narrator. However, to those new to the JFK assassination investigation, there are some critical things that will be introduced: the direction of the headshot; the probability of a pre-autopsy surgery to skew the autopsy's findings; this mishandling of the chain of evidence; and the autopsists' own credentials. Beware, some of the photos are gruesome if you've never seen the autopsy photos before.",1077408000,8,650,5.08411214953271
