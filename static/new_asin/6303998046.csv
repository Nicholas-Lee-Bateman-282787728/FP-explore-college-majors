I wonder why Kirsty Alley would stoop this low ? I  guess she needed some pocket change. But I wouldn't take a million bucks to  work with those two!",918604800,5,305,4.066666666666666

756447,5,6303998046,"I was so pleased to see this laugh-a-minute romp, fun for the whole family! The Olsen twins are as charming as ever, the characters have depth, and the plot was beautifully complex and unpredictable. I was miffed to see a flagrantly inaccuate portrayal of the therapeutic administration of fluoxetine (Prozac). As you well know, dear reader, fluoxetine is a long-acting first generation selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It is still used today, it's efficacy being as timeless as the plot to ""It Takes Two"". The mechanism is still poorly understood, however what we do know is it usually takes 4-8 weeks to reach therapeutic efficacy. Why, then, did Ms. Kensington take one of the wedding-goers' prozac as an anxiolytic prior to her wedding? ""That would be entirely ineffective!"" you might say. You'd be right. I hope in future Olsen twins movies we will see more appropriate medical humor. Thank you for your time.",1504396800,,928,5.071895424836601

757315,4,6303998046,"This movie was made when the Twins were at their most popular.  When they were cute, fun, lovable, little girls.

Their characters, Amanda and Alyssa, are identical strangers.  Alyssa was a rich girl, and had been raised to be refined and welled mannered.  Amanda was an orphan - street smart, bad mannered, and quite tough.  Despite there different upbringings, they were still dopplegangers.  There private rituals and personalities were the same.  When they first meet their clothes were the same stile.  Alyssa's were brand new and a perfect fit. Amanda's were old, probably second hand, and a poor fit.  Yet it was the same look on each, a weird mirror  affect.

They temporarily switch places, so each could see how the other lived.  The Camp Amanda, and many other orphans, attended was run by Dianne.  She was in affect a Mom to Amanda, and would have adopted Amanda already - if the system had allowed it.  Alyssa's dad, Roger, was a widower.  The Dopplegangers realized Dianne and Roger would be a perfect match, and arranged for them to meet.  After spending time in the others shoes, and time together, Amanda and Alyssa don't ever want to apart again.

Sub plots are about a cold harted bitch, Clarice,  who'd wormed her way into Roger's life.  Also a retched couple, the Butkis's,  who wanted to adopt Amanda.  The Butkis's used children as forced labor at their salvage yard.  Clarice planned to marry Roger, and exile Alyssa to a year round boarding school.

By the end of the movie the Butkis's were exposed to family services.  Clarice was publicly humiliated, and out of Roger's life.  Diane and Roger were in love.  The Dopplegangers were together, sisters in every way except birth.  The ending had all 4 of them riding off together, as a family, in a horse drawn carriage.",1460505600,,1794,4.777777777777778

758718,4,6303998046,"""It Takes Two"" is the friendly middle ground as far as Mary-Kate & Ashley movies are concerned: it retains their trademark ""adorable"" factor without the cloying cutesy-ness of their previous three films and exercises a family-friendly comprehensiveness that was forever lost on their later made-for-teen-girls DTV flicks. In short, this is probably the most perfect Mary-Kate & Ashley outing if there ever was one, and is definitely the most tasteful of their offerings to introduce new fans to.

The story: Amanda Lemmon (Mary-Kate Olsen) - a tough-talking orphan raised in New York City under the care of case worker Diane Barrows (Kirstie Alley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheers/dp/B001IXXYCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheers</a>) - is set to be adopted by a creepy couple exploiting child labor. Alyssa Callaway (Ashley Olsen) is the young daughter of a wealthy widower (Steve Guttenberg,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Police-Academy-series/dp/B0001907DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Police Academy series</a>) looking to marry a greedy witch of a woman (Jane Sibbett, ""Santa Barbara"") intending to ship Alyssa off to boarding school. When all seems out of their control, the two identical strangers meet during a summer outing and concoct a plan involving switching identities to bring their two guardians together in hopes of having them fall in love, thereby stopping the marriage and allowing Diane to adopt Amanda.

Granted, the synopsis seems like the half-baked kind of plot that you'd find in some of the twins' later movies, but if you can suspend disbelief enough to allow for the chance meeting that kicks off most of the action, the absurdity is very digestible for the fact that it's not overdone and is pulled off marvelously by the cast. Alley, Guttenberg, and Philip Bosco (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Best-Friend-s-Wedding/dp/0767802683/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Best Friend's Wedding</a>) as a colorful butler give exceptionally warm performances and end up as likeable as the girls themselves, while Sibbett is a perfectly hiss-able children's villain. On the whole, the twins do a good job (and would both be nominated by the Young Artist Awards for their performances), but I was disappointed that their initial distinctive personalities dissolve into a collective persona: Amanda starts off as a slang-spewing stickball player and Alyssa as an eloquent little prude, but halfway into the movie, you can't tell the two apart. It's kind of sloppy on the part of director Andy Tennant (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweet-Home-Alabama/dp/B00007E2F5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweet Home Alabama</a>), but thankfully, it's not a fatal goof.

The film is obviously aimed at children between six and twelve, but it lacks the asininity to inspire grownup headaches even if a parent doesn't really like the movie. It's mushy and a bit sing-songy in some parts, but makes up for it in handy humor and definite heart. I deem ""It Takes Two"" to be the most intelligent, competent, and accessible film that the Olsen twins have ever been a part of. Fans will already have it, but should a parent or young viewer be faced with the choice of this and, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billboard-Dad/dp/B000060MWR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billboard Dad</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passport-To-Paris/dp/B00005U2KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passport To Paris</a>, there ought to be no question about which one to choose.",1242259200,,3719,6.389662027833002

Even so, the girls are cute and the story line has plenty of fun and mischief built into it.  Pre-teen girls will especially like this movie.  There are some elements for adults - at least parents of children - to enjoy.

One small note of caution: there's a subtle but questionable message in this movie.  The wicked soon-to-be stepmother of one of the girls is driven away, giving the story its fairytale ending.  As that plays out, the message is sent that its good to humiliate and embarrass those that have wronged us .  Of course, the revenge exacted on the villainess is all in fun and somewhat deserved; nevertheless, the revenge message is fairly clear.

758789,5,6303998046,"After living through all the Olsen Twin videos when my children were younger, this movie stuck around and became a family favorite.  The twins and the story are both cute, but not syrupy-sweet, and there is a terriffic cast of adult actors as well.  Kirstie Alley and Steve Guttenberg have a fun chemistry; Jane Sibbett (from ""Friends"") is the perfect wicked soon-to-be-stepmom; Philip Bosco is the tough-guy butler with a heart.",1146787200,,429,5.028169014084507
758790,5,6303998046,"Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's first theatrical release was released in the same year that their breakout television series ""Full House"" wrapped up its 8-year-run, and this film was just one of thousands of efforts to help the girls maintain a Hollywood career beyond ""Full House."" Those countless mystery/party videos, music recordings, books-on-tape and straight-to-video movies became a phenomenal marketing franchise. That all led to a few more short-lived TV series and very successful clothing/merchandise line, among many other things, and now that Mary-Kate and Ashley are almost 21 years old they are far and away two of the biggest, most successful child actresses America is likely to see.

Before the Olsens began promoting fashion and sticking their names on virtually everything they could get their hands on, they were children. They were young child actresses who played ""Michelle Tanner"" on TV and used that cuteness as a vehicle toward the several movies and home videos that were created for them. ""It Takes Two"" is a wonderful film for long-time followers of the Olsen franchise to revisit and enjoy. At 8 years old, the girls really were very sweet and fun to watch on screen. This movie gave them a chance to work with some bigger name actors, and there's no doubt they worked very nicely alongside Kirstie Alley and Steve Guttenberg.

Many have dubbed ""It Takes Two"" as a cross between ""The Prince and the Pauper"" and ""The Parent Trap,"" and that's basically what the film is. Orphaned tomboy Amanda (Mary-Kate) and a wealthy ""Daddy's little princess"" Alyssa (Ashley), two identical strangers, literally run into each other and scheme to unite Amanda's attractive social worker (Kirstie Alley) and Alyssa's lonely widowed father (Steve Guttenberg), all while struggling to get rid of Dad's monster of a fiance. The plot gave the girls some simple, consistent material to work with, and few can deny that they were very endearing at this age. They may be a different Mary-Kate and Ashley than they were in the early/mid 1990's, but we will always have things like this to remember those young, charismatic little faces that first captured the hearts of America.",1146009600,,2180,5.103641456582633
758791,4,6303998046,"The twins must be given full credits for injecting a breath of fresh air into this familiar plot. Afterall, it is very similar to the 1961 Parent Trap and its 1998 remake.

Yet this movie came up with the ingenius idea of actually recruiting the Olsen twins, instead of one girl only, to play the two roles. Instead of asking a child to shoot each scene twice, Mary-Kate and Ashley could really respond to each other and focus on the characters comfortably. There were unexpected twists and enough big shots for the twins to engage their talking eyes and sweet smiles, play cunning tricks on the step-mother to be and match-making. The result was a warm and alluring family movie!

If flaws must be found, one definitely would be exaggerating the shortcomings of Clarice, the stepmother-to-be. No way the father of the twins would be attracted to Clarice. There was also no attempt of explaining why the two girls looked so much alike. Despite all this, this movie provides a very delightful past time!",1138752000,,1002,4.752873563218391

758876,5,6303998046,The Asley twins were a hit playing their respective roles. I would say that this movie would be part the Prince...(OOPS!) Princess & the Pauper and part Cinderella (in a sense). I especially enjoyed Philip Bosco. His role was brilliant!,1101772800,,236,4.925
758877,5,6303998046,"I LIKE THIS MOVIE IT IS A LATER ADAPTION OF THE PARENT TRAP BUT FUNNIER. I LIKE THIS MOVIE IT HAS STEVE GUTTENBERG, KIRSTIE ALLEY, AND THE OLSON TWINS . I LIKED THIS MOVIE IT WAS FUNNY. AND IT WAS GOOD AND THE TWINS DID A GOOD JOB AND HAD FIXED THAT MEAN STEPMOTHER GOOD. IF YOU LIKED THE PARENT TRAP WITH HALEY MILLS THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY ENJOY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!",1100995200,,366,4.169014084507042
758878,5,6303998046,"It is an excellent movie, probally the best and funniest starring the Olsen twins. Good starring and excellent acting, one of the few movies that I watched that do not have boring scenes at all. It was very funny and I laughed a lot. I worked also as nanny and the children that I was responsible for really loved this movie. I recommend, principally if you have kids or loves the Olsen twins.",1090368000,,393,4.397260273972603
758879,5,6303998046,"Even though i am NOT one for remakes. And this is a remake of the
classic Disney movie ""The Parent Trap"" but underneath a different name. This is one remake that is even better the original. The Olsen Twins are these days' Shirley Temple. Both on screen and the way they conduct themselves. We have gotten to meet them and trust me they are the same in real life. We been fans of the TwinS since fuLL house days. I only have to warn parents of one thing in this movie that Mary-Kate does suprise the viewer with the use of a somewhat ""dirty word"".I would tell you what it is but it would most likely not get posted. Its P*SSED.Ok from that you can tell.
If you don't want your kids hearing that then stay away. But remember they hear that and worse then that in school and can't stop them from going to school. But most importantly the TwinS deliver in this movie. We have been blessed now with 18 years of their sweetness and talent. We wish them all the best they deserve all that they got. And when child stars turn out as they did that is more then an achievement. Don't miss this movie. And as for the Twins this is their best and that is saying a lot. Sit back relax and laugh and enjoy and double your viewing pleasure with the Olsen TwinS : Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen......",1074211200,3,1279,4.224489795918367
758951,4,6303998046,"I love the Olsen twins! I was born the month after they were, and they started acting at about two months old I think so I've grown up watching them.  This one is my favorite.  It reminds me so much of ""The Parent Trap"", but I like this one better.  It's all about how these two girls meet and they come up with a plan to get Amanda Lemon's caseworker and Alssya Callaway's father together, even though they are from completely different walks of life, one growing up in a New York City Orphanage, and the other in the rich, ritzy sort of life.",1057536000,,544,4.211538461538462

758953,4,6303998046,"I really enjoy this romantic comedy and it is one of my favourite movies.  Good acting by the Olsen twins, Kirstie Alley, and Steve Guttenberg.  The adults get into some funny predicaments and it is a great movie for all ages.  The only thing I don't like about this movie is the frequent overuse of God's name, which was rather unnecessary in my opinion.  If you want a enjoyable story though, you'll enjoy this one.  It is set in New York and you see the Twin Towers and Statue of Liberty.  This movie will make you smile! :-)",1034553600,,528,4.336734693877551
758954,5,6303998046,I love this movie. Best movie Mary-Kate And Ashley have EVER made. It had great actors and The twins did a great job at acting. I hope they will be great in their next film. unlike the others they have made. Buy this Movie!!!!!,1034380800,,227,4.181818181818182

But I didn't like the joke that one of the twins did, when she steped on Claries dress, that wasn't funny at ALL!
But the Olsen's twins were adorable in this movie!",1024444800,,217,4.190476190476191
759012,5,6303998046,"O.K. so it may not be an emmy award but it is still pretty good. I love it. I think it is the Olsen Twins best movie. With Kirstie Alley and Steve Guttenburgh they really light up the screen and don't forget about the adorable twins. Veary much like the Parent Trap. Good for all ages, whether your an Olsen fan or not you will love it. I know I do. I don't see why some other people say there was really bad acting but I think the acting is really good. Very simular to the Parent Trap and I love that movie also. This would be the best Olsen movie.",1001808000,,550,3.963963963963964
759013,5,6303998046,Simular to the Parent Trap! Both the 1963 and 1998 one. For those who like the Parent Trap and love family or kid kind of movies would love this video. It is veary funny and is a joy to watch. Mary-Kate and Ashley were veary good actresses in this feature length movie. Even if you are not a MKA fan you would still love it. I would say it is the best of all their videos.,996192000,,372,3.9078947368421053

759015,5,6303998046,My 4 year-old daughter rents this movie every week from our local library.  Even my husband loves to sit and watch this movie with her.  We can't wait to buy it.  It's a fun and cute movie for people of all ages.  I love that my daughter would rather see a Mary Kate and Ashley movie over a Britney Spears video!  The Olsen twins have kept up a good reputation for good clean fun movies!!!!!,989020800,2,391,4.16
759016,5,6303998046,"Amanda lives in an orphanage where her only real friend is her social worker.  Alyssa is the only child of a multi-millionaire.  But one summer, they meet by accident and hatch a daring plan.  They switch places and try to get Amanda's social worker and Alyssa's dad to fall in love before he marries an awful woman.  But when the fianc&eacute;e figures out what's going on, can the girls pull it off?
Granted, this movie is a variation of The Parent Trap.  And while there were a few unexpected twists, there really isn't anything new to the plot.  But the movie is incredibly fun.  The first time I saw it I laughed so hard it hurt, and I was in college at the time.  The movie creates humor from the premise, sometimes setting up jokes well ahead of the punch line.  The Olsens do a good job with the acting.  It's fun watching them basically play each other.  The adults do a fabulous job with their rolls, making it easy to get lost in this world.
I have shared this movie with many friends since I first saw it, and they all enjoyed it.  I highly recommend this entertaining film.",986774400,15,1086,4.375
759017,5,6303998046,It takes two is the Olsen's only big screen movie.(so far...hey I can hope!) It is also their only movie so far that is rated pg. I love this movie and one day while I was at home I watched it all day! You have to see it.,985651200,,221,3.625
759018,5,6303998046,"Not only does ""It Takes Two"" have a great plot, but it shows how great Mary-Kate & Ashley can act!  At the age of 9, they were a lot more believable than any other child actor/actress, and could compete with Steve Guttenberg & Kirstey Alley for serious acting roles.  I've seen this movie countless times, and it'll go  down as one of the biggest classics of all-time!",976665600,3,368,4.462686567164179
759019,5,6303998046,"This is my favorite Olsen Twins movie, and I'm an adult who can honestly say she enjoys it.  I grew up on Full House and have always loved watching those two.  They've done a lot of movies, and this one is my favorite.  Supported by the charming Steve Guttenberg, the extremely funny Kirstie Alley, and a supporting cast that includes Philip Bosco as the sly and smart butler and Jane Sibbett as Clarice, the snooty, evil-plotting fiance of Guttenberg's character, this movie is sure to please any fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley.  So the story goes kind of like this: look-alikes Amanda and Alyssa (Mary-Kate and Ashley, respectively) literally bump into each other while at a summer camp (that Amanda's a camper at and that Alyssa's extremely rich father happens to own).  Once the two realize how closely they resemble each other, they hatch a plan to get Alyssa's single dad and Amanda's pretty caseworker romantically involved.  Will they succeed, amidst foodfights, canoes falling over, and the interference of the conniving Clarice?  This is a fun movie from beginning to end, with lots of visual treats (Andy Tennant Films--Fools Rush In, Ever After, etc.--always seem to have beautiful scenery), funny dialogue, and fantastic characters.  There's exactly one slightly objectionable word (spoken by one of the Olsens), but I think only very conservative parents will have a problem with it.  This movie is part Parent Trap, part Three Men And A Little Lady, and . . . basically just a really cute movie.",974937600,36,1507,4.948412698412699

759059,1,6303998046,"What words could describe the undue vileness which is this film. The story  is a complete rip off of the parent trap, except that it lacks all the that  movie's charm. Can someone tell me if there is an island that we can use to  drop off Steve Guttenberg and The Olsen twins, so we can make sure that a  travesty like this never ever happens again? Oh please say yes. I will pay  money, big money.
Otherwise, if you are lacking a cerebral cortex, you  will love this movie.",968284800,6,474,4.211111111111111

Amanda is an orphan heading off to Camp Callaway (coincidentally owned by Alyssa's father  Roger) with her best friend and social worker Diane Barrows.  Alyssa is a  rich little girl who hardly sees her father at all, and he is getting  married to an abnormally horrendous woman.  When the girls bump smack into  each other in the woods, they find that they are complete look-alikes.  Together they scheme to bring Alyssa's father and Diane together before  adoption and marriage break them up.  A great movie, especially for fans of  the Olsens.

Cool is that Ernie Grunwald starring is this movie  would also be starring in the twins' TV-show Two of a kind. The music in  the movie is great, but not as great as the music John Williams composes.
