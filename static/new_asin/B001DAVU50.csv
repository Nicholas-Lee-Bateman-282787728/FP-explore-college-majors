3527877,5,B001DAVU50,"I have watched this documentary over and over; then I loaned it to my grandparents to watch and they simply loved it, it was hard for me to get it back from them. The documentary has a special charm, and shows the ""real"" New Orleans and the outlying communities; what a special place. This documentary is a serious work, and is very different from what you might see on network TV. It is a real gem. Highly recommended.",1317945600,,419,4.384615384615385
3527878,5,B001DAVU50,"I have been lucky enough to visit the `Big Easy` twice now (and am planning a third trip !), and because I love the city, I collect any films or books about it. I found this dvd to be an excellent addition to my collection. It`s really informative, and told me about the first black newspaper in the U.S. and thet earliest civil rights movement which had started in this city long before Martin Luther King and Rosa Parkes. This documentary is emotional, because it shows the neighbourhood and locals pre and post Katrina, and you really the sense of loss and displacement on a personal scale. I have visited other cities and states in the U.S, but there is NO WHERE as unique as the Crescent city - it`s laid back, the people friendly, amazing cuisine, and unique architecture, which just emphasizes the tragedy that this city`s suffered even more. If you are interested in African American history or just love N`awlins then this dvd is a must !!!",1300924800,10,949,4.588235294117647

3527880,5,B001DAVU50,"This documentary has it all, the feeling of the current neighborhood along with the history behind it. Beautifully filmed and smartly told, FAUBOURG TREME unfolds like a story told by a favorite relative who has sat you down to remind you of who you are. Whether you've seen the HBO TV series about this neighborhood or not, there's a lot to learn here, a lot to love. Historic, yes. Unique? Most certainly. But the best thing about this documentary is how it renders such a clear picture of the way people shape and are shaped by place.",1297555200,5,537,4.546391752577319

3527883,5,B001DAVU50,"Fortunately you can still order the DVD online at [...] or go to [...]. These are the web sites of the directors and producers of the film. I own it and have purchased copies for friends. It is the most informative and moving documentary on New Orleans I have ever seen. It is also an reminder, and eye opener for some, of how unique and valuable New Orleans Culture is to America. An outstanding production that deserves a place in every DVD collection that reflects the roots and culture of USA. The music alone is a good reason to purchase the DVD. It is also the only film available today that entered production long before Katrina and came to completion after Katrina. It is a unique opportunity to follow the lives of individuals before and after the storm, and experience the true impact of the storm on the lives of so many Americans. Buy it and enjoy it. You will not be dissapointed.",1272931200,33,894,4.49079754601227
3527884,5,B001DAVU50,"I saw this documentary when it was broadcast last year on PBS. It is a touching, historic, tale about the oldest black neighborhood in New Orleans which predates the civil war, Faubourg Treme.

If you haven't seen this documentary you won't know that Homer Plessy, the second most famous plaintiff in supreme court history (Plessy v. Ferguson) came from Faubourg Treme, the district which is the setting for the new HBO drama series ""Treme"" about post Katrina New Orleans.

Homer Plessy, a Faubourg Treme resident, sued for equal access to public transportation and lost at a time when the law of the land held that separate cars for blacks and whites could be equal. He was way ahead of Brown v. Board of Education which reversed Plessy and held that separate can never be equal in education.

If you haven't seen the documentary,Faubourg Treme, the series Treme won't make a whole lot of sense to you. But you can't buy a copy of Faubourg Treme now because apparently HBO has taken it off the market to avoid competition with its new series Treme. This is a big mistake.

The documentary is an inspiring story about the birthplace of black culture, the civil rights movement, and a Harlem Renaissance of the arts which took place here in a district where free blacks lived, worked, and prospered 150 years ago--way before Brown v. Board of Education became the law of the land in 1954.

Without the documentary for context Treme the series is a story about a group of black and white residents of New Orleans trying to rebuild their city after Katrina-- without the historical context. The series should promote the sale of the documentary, not prohibit it. That way viewers would appreciate the new series so much more.",1271203200,41,1722,4.76510067114094
3527885,5,B001DAVU50,I saw this video on PBS and was amazed at the story it tells. It is trully a great story and should be seen.  I now see that Amazon says it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  Am I paranoid to think that this is a conspiricy to cover up the blatent racisim of this country?,1259971200,4,281,4.0

3527887,5,B001DAVU50,Great for those seeking history of the area. Areas such as the projects are gone; the church life is gone; the strong sense of pride even under poor conditions are gone,1410307200,,168,4.451612903225806

I've only been to New Orleans once, but I'm too excited about going back. And this time I'm making sure I get over to the Treme.",1372636800,,311,4.183333333333334
3527893,4,B001DAVU50,"This documentary covers the New Orleans neighborhood of Faubourg Trem&eacute;, America's oldest African-American neighborhood, from slavery, through the Civil Rights era (with disturbing images) and beyond, to Hurricane Katrina and the present day.  Not only is Trem&eacute; the home of jazz music and Congo Square (a former gathering place of slaves and free men), but it also became the birthplace of the Southern civil rights movement when, in 1892, activist Homer Plessy, a man of mixed-race heritage and a Caucasian appearance, staged an opposition to a recent law which restricted Blacks from occupying train car seating and accommodations designated strictly for Caucasians - resulting in a landmark Supreme Court decision upholding the law that was challenged.

The film provides a poignant look at the effects Hurricane Katrina had on Trem&eacute;'s residents, their deep love and appreciation for the neighborhood's history (where, long before slavery ended in the South, free Blacks thrived, owning property and running businesses) in light of the damage caused by the hurricane, and their hope for its future.

I would like to have seen more time spent on the origins and slave-related history of the neighborhood.  Most of the running time is devoted to the Civil Rights era and Hurricane Katrina's aftermath, which is understandable, if the film is meant to raise continued awareness of the neighborhood's plight post-Katrina.  With that said, I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested and consider it to be an hour well spent.",1370563200,3,1555,5.382716049382716
3527894,5,B001DAVU50,"As someone who is currently researching family history in Faubourg Treme, I was delighted to see the masterful way in which the filmmakers blended history from the 1700s with current events. Inspiring and tragic, I would recommend this documentary to anyone who has an interest in learning some of the amazing events and information about New Orleans, not currently covered in standard school history books.",1365638400,,407,5.276923076923077
3527895,5,B001DAVU50,"This is a nicely nuanced appreciation of the oldest section of New Orleans, which today is apparently better known by its very anonymous Ward number.  This is all very politically correct nowadays for describing a part of the town which historically was anything but politically correct. It was the heart of progressive black America during a large part of the 19th century, but was abruptly strangulated after the supreme court's decision to legalize segregation took hold, just towards the end of that century.
This well researched documentary actually covers much of the same ground as another documentary by PBS simply called New Orleans. Whereas the PBS documentary deals with the whole city, this one deals basically with the area known as Trem, although there is considerable overlap. Faubourg Trem, however, is a much more intimate look at the neighbourhood, as seen by a selected number of its present and erstwhile inhabitants. It takes you through its troubled and colourful history with a very personal touch, especially when it comes to describing the tragedy of Katrina.
For anyone interested in this particular part of town in this particular part of the world, which has no doubt been awakened by that stellar TV series, Trem, it's all here if you want to know more about what are the essential ingredients that go to make up this diverse cultural, culinary and musical world.",1333497600,3,1392,5.052173913043478
