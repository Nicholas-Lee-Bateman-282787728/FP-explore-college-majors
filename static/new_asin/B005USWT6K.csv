8487116,3,B005USWT6K,"The 2003 edition is far better- more riding, less interviews with people you never heard of and will never meet.
But even the 2010 edition is better than the 2012, which I have just seen; that one deserves 2 stars because there is so little continuity, you only get to see a few sections.  But it's GREAT on the interviews, which are endless.  There is far more ""human interest"" than trials riding.  A pity, because Duke's bike videos used to be the gold standard.",1358208000,,464,4.5
