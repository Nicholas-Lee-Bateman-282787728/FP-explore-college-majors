8235690,4,B000ZJ2ZHW,"A lot of viewers might disagree with the four-star rating, based on the melodramatics of this title, but I found the acting and directing quite effective in telling an all-too-familiar story about the US's brutal immigration policies. They make it okay to shoot anybody running across any land in the southwestern states! Ours is the land of the free-to-kill? Jorje A. Jimenez is believable as the anguished illegal deported away from work and wife and child. The cruelty of the Latina immigration lawyer only underscores the helplessness of legal residents and naturalized citizens to reunite shattered families. Kristel Lara plays the confused and abused wife, prey to any opportunistic letcher who wants to ""help."" Daughter Dalia is professionally performed by child actress Mariana Watchter. Nice scenics but hate the ""unsteadycam"" shots waving the lens about to try to add dramatics to action scenes. Why hasn't IMDb discovered this film yet?",1219449600,4,947,5.32
