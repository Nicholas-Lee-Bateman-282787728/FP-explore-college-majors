8440507,5,B004T4N398,"A very good documentary of an Anthropologic and Forensic investigation of the Custer battlefield. The subject matter and location along w/ the historical significance of this battlefield is very interesting and as such needed to be documented while it is still possible. The forensic study and excavation was fascinating (to me) and as such I found that the movie was truncated through editing and needed to be longer; more complete. If I remember correctly this was produced in 1990 which make it rather dated but the material is still very poignant. Though the venue, VHS, is dated and this material is not available on DVD, it will be difficult for most to view it.",1419033600,,668,4.868421052631579

8440509,4,B004T4N398,"Besides being a well-constructed documentary on the Battle of the Little Bighorn, what brings significant value to this film, is that it explores not only the Reno valley fight of the battle, but gives more insight into the Reno-Benteen hilltop defense as well. By drawing on accounts from the officers and men who were besieged while Custer and his immediate command were wiped out a few miles away, Custer's Last Trooper places its audience in the thick of the dust and heat as the battle unfolds around them. Through these accounts and actual body locations drawn up just days after the battle, this documentary seeks to find the true identity of Custer's last trooper.",1355011200,9,672,4.9035087719298245
