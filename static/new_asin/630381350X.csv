708239,1,630381350X,"Cheesiest movie I've watched in a long, long, time.  Bad enough that you'll laugh so much you'll want to keep watching.  It's worse than Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""",1418601600,,172,4.516129032258065
708240,1,630381350X,"The acting was so bad and the movie had such a cheap feel to it that I gave up watching after twenty-five minutes. To me it looked as if  it was filmed using a super 8 camera, who knows maybe it was.  I really didn't care what happened to anyone in this movie before or after the plane crashed. Maybe it got better as it went along, that I'll never know and I really don't care.",1415491200,,378,3.960526315789474

708243,3,630381350X,"There are no special effects; and, no ordinary effects.  It is hard to say this is a bad movie, sitting in a convertible with popcorn and a date, its the perfect background scenery.  Watch it with friends while playing Monopoly, have a contest to see who can find more bloopers. ""Caxambu"", you will not know who they are when the movie begins and you still won't know when the movie ends.",1406505600,,388,4.450704225352113
708244,5,630381350X,"Exciting adventure abounds in this action thriller when Keith Larsen plays a gentle jeweler who is kidnapped by thieves and forced to cut diamonds for them.  His arm is injured after struggling with the small private plane pilot for the gun.  The plane crashes in the Amazon Jungle, where headhunters discover them.  Larsen and his wife find their way to safety at the home of a missionary, but the bad guys may not be as lucky.",1358294400,,428,4.605263157894737

7853215,4,630381350X,"After pulling off a big diamond heist, criminal mastermind Vince Neff (John Ireland- THE HOUSE OF SEVEN CORPSES, SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS, TERROR NIGHT) and his fellow thieves call in a diamond-cutter and his wife (Carol Ohmart- HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, SPIDER BABY). While making their airborne escape, trouble occurs, and the plane crashes deep in the Brazilian jungle. Lost and wanted by the authorities, the group soon realizes that these are minor concerns compared to what awaits them in the bush! Big snakes, crocodiles, and deadly spiders run rampant. In addition to the dangerous wildlife, a tribe of headhunters is pursuing them! Grave peril and death ensue. CAXAMBU is an entertaining adventure film from 1967. It builds rather slowly, but thankfully, the indigenous tribe has several surprises in store for the intruders. For her part, Ms. Ohmart looks great, even w/ her blond hair cut short. Recommended for the jungle movie fan...",1428278400,,939,5.225165562913907
