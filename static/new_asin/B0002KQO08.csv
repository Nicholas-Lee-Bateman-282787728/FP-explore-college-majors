8028490,1,B0002KQO08,Jacki Chan is great. This movie is totally OUT OF FOCUS. Don't ruin your eyes trying to watch it.,1489795200,,97,4.157894736842105
8028491,4,B0002KQO08,"I was more fortunate than the reviewers below in that my disc plays fine on my PC's DVD player. As the title suggests, this is just the early stuff that cemented Jackie as a star in Asia. Yes, the video footage is just as you would expect from films of this genre and era (grainy and poor audio) but you wouldn't be here if you expected anything different, right? The bottom line is that you will find yourself unable to take your eyes off the screen while Jackie and his talented partners are performing the most incredible Kung Fu, of many different styles, that has ever been seen on film. No special features but there are six scene selection markers on the main menu. This film tries to be a documentary with a narration by Rick Baker (nice British accent). He basically introduces several of the scenes explaining which movie they are from and some of the styles being used but there is way too little information about Jackie to be a real documentary so the film basically becomes a platform to simply show Jackie's POWERFUL talent as a martial artist - the greatest ever known!",1180915200,2,1085,4.540816326530612
8028492,1,B0002KQO08,"One star is not a rating of a film, but rather rating of DVD... Movie might be good, but I never got to watching it. The reason is that DVD is not playable. Nor by PS2, computer, DVD player or anything else. One of the reviewers recommends not to get  ""Video Asia"" products, but any other Video Asia stuff worked. My advice is to watch out for a little label that says ""Fortune 5 DVD"". I purchased a DVD box called ""Martial Temple Collection"" that holds five DVDs... Four of them work well, but the one with Fortune 5 label doesn't work. Coinsidence? I don't think so.",1120176000,4,568,4.308411214953271
8028493,1,B0002KQO08,"Like the above review I too purchased this DVD and was sad to find that it will not play in anything I put it in; DVD Player, Playstation 2, Xbox, ETC.  I had bought the box set ""Bruce Lee Legacy"" that was distributed by the same company that did this title-""VideoAsia,"" and they all worked fine.  I tried to find an email address or a website for the company that released this DVD, but was not lucky in my search.  My advice to anyone who is into Kung Fu flicks is to stay away from anything distributed by ""VideoAsia.""",1110240000,2,521,4.242424242424242
8028494,1,B0002KQO08,"Pre-order it so I could be one of the first to watch in the country, But it's not compatible with my JVC-(DVD,VCR), or my PS2. So, before ordering, make for sure it be playable in the USA. It's suppost to be the best of the best parts and story of Jackie Chan's career! ""I know, you are welcome!""",1100736000,,296,4.120689655172414
