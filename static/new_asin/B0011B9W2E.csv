8241234,5,B0011B9W2E,"While I've never been hunting for some reason I saw this on tv one day and watched it and it ended up being one of my favorite shows. Barta proves it's not always about the kill. It's about doing things the hard way,the Barta way.",1376870400,,230,4.133333333333334

8241238,1,B0011B9W2E,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend, they opened it and it was missing disc one! HOW EMBARRASSING right?!? And the questions begin with where did you buy this? I would recommend not buying DVD's from the company, I also have friends that have made purchases from them and they two were missing Disc one or two. Not worth the money, they also make you pay to return the item to get a refund. That's right you pay two times for their mistake! I would have rather paid full price and actually got what I should have in the first place. Don't make my mistake!!!",1326585600,,568,4.268518518518518

8241240,4,B0011B9W2E,Good videos for entertainment purposes.  The hunts are realistic and Tred is a pretty entertaining character.  Other than the water safety they are not instructional or meant to be.  More just a view into the life of a bow hunter and fisherman.,1213401600,,244,4.761904761904762
