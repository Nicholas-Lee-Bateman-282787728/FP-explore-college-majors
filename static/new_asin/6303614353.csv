696733,2,6303614353,"These several-movies-in-one movies for some reason always attracted me. And Night On Earth from 1991 is yet another interesting variant of the kind.
Five little movies all taking place at the same time in cabs in  five different metropoles, the time difference taken into consideration.  From seven past seven in the evening in Los Angeles, via New York, Paris,  Roma, to seven past five in the morning in Helsinki.
In spite of the  interesting idea, Night On Earth is in fact pretty boring.
The two  American contributions are the two best ones. In the first one, we see  Winona Ryder as a chain-smoking cabdriver who does not want to become much  more, not even when she gets a dream offer. In New York, we follow a black  man whom nobody cares to care about until he himself gets the opportunity  to help somebody who's even more alienated than him.
The other three  little movies are plain boring even though the now famous Italian comedian  Roberto Benigni (a.o. La Vita E Bella and Asterix) probably is funny in  the Roma movie... if you understand him.
Anyway all of the five  contributions are typical for their country, or maybe only typical for  foreign people's prejudice about the countries.",944352000,5,1203,4.776699029126213
696734,5,6303614353,"Night on Earth is truly a hilarious film that entertains, enriches, and teaches about the sometimes depressing insignificance of humans on the individual level.  The stories each have a unique feel, (there are five of  them, from LA to Helsinki) and capture a certain element of the given  locale, one of which I am a native of (NYC). My favorite is, however, the  Rome vignette, starring Bennini as a crazy Roman cabby who drives with  sunglasses in the dark.

NIGHT ON EARTH: The central conceit of this uneven entry is five taxi trips taken simultaneously in five different nighttime time zones around the world. The first vignette, set in Los Angeles, is a wry dialog between a tough casting agent (Rowlands) with an eye for talent and a tougher young cabbie (Ryder) with her own life agenda. Episode Number Two, set in New York, is a loud, raucous comedy about the difficulty of understanding anything different, whether it's another culture, another person or another gender. The third, and shortest, segment, set in Paris, explores the question of who's really blind: a bitter but insightful sightless woman, or the driver who can't see past his own prejudices. Number Four alone justifies the entire price of a rental: a Rome cabbie's (Benigni) nonstop, mile-a-minute confession to a priest with his own problems. Oddly, this comic film ends with a tale of tragedy set in Helsinki, when a driver sobers up a group of drunken buddies with his own sob story.

""Night On Earth"" is overall an ambitious, admirable and essentially successful experiment. (Who else works in the short story form on film? Besides Altman.) The high points outnumber the lows, and these highs fly higher than the lows ever go. The New York story, for instance, features characters so unique they must be real, and Rosie Perez's baby voice and potty mouth allow her the ultimate last word when she turns on a guy and ""curses him out."" If you simply skip the bookends and watch the three central segments, this is a fabulous film.",1422230400,,1807,4.751592356687898

Essentially, it conveys the collective commonality of humankind. We all have the same experiences, both good and bad, we are predictable and more often surprisingly and pleasantly unpredictable.

697149,5,6303614353,"Jim Jarmusch once said, ""The beauty of life is in small details, not in big events."" In his movie Night on Earth he has shown in a brilliant way that this is true.
For those who find the New York episode fascinating, a book has just been published dealing exclusively with that episode: Bernd Wahlbrinck, ""Jim Jarmusch's NIGHT ON EARTH: THE NEW YORK EPISODE - with an appendix for English teachers""",1318032000,,398,4.619718309859155
697150,4,6303614353,"NIGHT ON EARTH (1991), the fourth film by American auteur Jim Jarmusch, is a series of vignettes centered around taxi journeys in the US and Europe over a single winter night. There is no overarching plot, but rather each segment is a study in interaction between the driver and his fare.

In Los Angeles, Winona Ryder is a 16 year-old tomboy taxi driver and Gena Rowland is a Hollywood casting agent. In New York, Armin Mueller-Stahl is an immigrant from East Germany who gets a crash course on American culture after he takes Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez to Brooklyn. Crossing the Atlantic, we first go to Paris where Isaac de Bankole, an Ivorian immigrant who faces the challenge of racism daily, picks up blind woman Batrice Dalle who could care less what colour his skin is.

The last two segments are less about class or race and more humorous and individual. In Rome, Roberto Benigni finds an opportunity to confess a long list of sins after he picks up priest Paolo Bonacelli. This is a hilarious scene, the best part of the film. In Helsinki, Matti Pellonp brings three drunks home (Kari Vnnen, Sakari Kuosmanen, and Tomi Salmela), but after they bemoan their misfortune, he tells them what real suffering is.

For the most part, this is one of Jarmusch's weakest films. There is that inconsistency between the study of power hierarchies and the straight-up comedy. The Paris segment is nothing but cliches about how the blind might not see, but their other senses are more powerful than the sighted. The New York and Helsinki segments are hommages to Jarmusch's peers Spike Lee and Aki Kaurismaki respectively, using their settings and borrowing some of their actors. While the New York scene has Jarmusch's characteristic humour, Jarmusch's style is almost completely effaced in the Helsinki scene and one could believe he's watching a Kaurismaki film.

But oddly, I still feel compelled to give this film a universal recommendation, as the Benigni scene is great. Here the Italian actor is at his best with his trademark rhetoric and -- suprisingly, considering he's behind a steering wheel the whole time -- his skills at physical comedy.",1303171200,,2157,4.917582417582418

697157,5,6303614353,"Jim Jarmusch's affinity for the humanity in those who might otherwise seem abrasive or distant is fully evident in this touching and lovely film, finally out in a version that does it justice.  The film looks very good and sounds great in its new Criterion edition, that includes some nice extras on a single disc: Jim Jarmusch is always fascinating -- just to watch and even better to hear what he is saying -- and answers questions about the film and about his filmmaking in a few of the extras here, there is also a nice booklet of essays and reminiscences.  Jim Jarmusch has often been said to have a more European than American sensibility as a filmmaker -- and this film shows how he could win that reputation -- but at the same time, I think of this film and all of his films as distinctively American, but as having an eye for some of the diversity of American culture.  His approach to making films seems to be akin to that of a musician who accumulates a wide range of influences from around the world and distills them into something fresh and spontaneous and mellow.  One of the things I like most about his films is that whatever happens the mood stays mellow, like Jazz, like the Blues, like the Tom Waits crooning that tends to accompany his films -- the characters can get upset, things can get out of control but you can watch patiently with a half smile because the camera is in control, everything is cool, relax man and just watch the picture.

If you've never seen a Jarmusch film this wouldn't be a bad place to start -- I know some people find the austerity of Stranger than Paradise (one of my favorite films of all time) and Down by Law a bit offputting.  It would be hard not to be charmed and intrigued by the five stories in this film: five encounters in a taxicab, all taking place at the same time, but in different parts of the world (LA, NYC, Paris, Rome, Helsinki).  The films are all fairly closely connected in general theme: a cab driver and passenger who on the surface couldn't be more different but turn out to be very similar in ways that aren't always apparent to themselves but are to the audience (the exception is the Roberto Benigni film set in Rome, which is funny to the point of pain, but seems a bit out of place here).  Still, the approach of each film is fairly distinct and suggestive of the different sensibilities of each place.  Jarmusch has a keen eye for details in each location, and is able to capture each city in ways that are a bit askew from how they tend to be represented in film (except perhaps for Helsinki, where the sensibility and style of the film seems to have a great deal of affinity for Finland's most famous director, Aki Kaurismaki, who I know Jarmusch admires and who also admires Jarmusch).  The performances are excellent and distinctive -- Beatrice Dalle stands out in her stunning performance as a blind woman, and the film features one of my favorite performances by Winona Ryder as a young but tough cabbie.  Each of the segments would work well on its own, and stand with the very best short films, but it adds up to something more.  This is definitely not one to miss for anyone who loves film.",1199664000,4,3180,4.454388984509467

The picture is fresh and vivid, and Tom Waits' haunting soundtrack is resonant. Jim Jarmusch pairs contrasting actors in each vignette as the movie circles the globe in a series of nighttime taxi rides. The best is the taxi ride in Rome, ably navigated by Roberto Benigni, as he imposes his confession on a helpless priest. There has never been another movie like it, and ""Night on Earth"" is Jarmusch's most underrated and brilliant work.",1198800000,,559,4.656565656565657

697231,5,6303614353,"""Night on earth"" may be seen as a earthly anecdote - taking into account it's a comedy , at a fist glance -  but, since we refer to Jim Jarmusch, the most emblematic and irreverent American filmmaker by then, some additional reflections should be made.

L.A. , N.Y.C., Paris, Rome and Helsinki. Five well different stories, surrounded by a same circumstance, casual encounters between cab driver and passenger.

As you se, an innovative proposal that preceded by years to the multidimensional stages in which movies like Crash and Babel were elaborated under similar patterns.

Everyone of these exhilarating dialogues are very  absorbing and magnificently written. Since the surrealistic episode in Rome (in which Jarmusch pays a heartfelt tribute to  Luis Bunuel) until the overwhelming conversation in N.Y.C.

To my view, this is until this date the most complete and ambitious project of the smart filmmaker. Supported by a splendid cast and edition process.",1194825600,2,962,5.248366013071895
697232,5,6303614353,This is a great movie. All of the stories are different and very well done. It is one of my favorite moves.,1191628800,,107,3.909090909090909
697233,4,6303614353,"If there is a ""sleeper"" in the Jarmusch catalog, it would have to his ode to taxi drivers, ""Night on Earth"".The film is framed by a structural device that Jarmusch previously utilized in his 1989 film ""Mystery Train""; it is a collection of loosely connected vignettes that all take place in the course of one evening. Instead of taking place in one location, however, ""Night on Earth"" is spread out over five cities and two continents.

The film gets off to a shaky start in Los Angeles, with a relatively flat segment. Wynona Rider plays an outspoken, gum cracking cabbie who picks up a fare at the airport (Gena Rowlands) who turns out to be a Hollywood casting director (er-guess what happens). It's worth sitting through just to see these two interesting actresses working together, if nothing else.

Don't let the bland appetizer put you off, however, because things improve rapidly with the second vignette. Spike Lee regulars Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez hitch a ride to Brooklyn with an amiable German cabbie (Armin Mueller-Stahl) whose driving skills (and sense of NYC geography) are marginal at best. Jamusch milks maximum laughs out of the cross-cultural pollination that ensues (a recurring theme in his films).

Next, we jump the pond over to Paris, where an African immigrant cab driver (Isaach De Bankole) has endured a long night of racist insults and obnoxious passengers. He spots a blind woman (Beatrice Dalle, who dazzled in one of my favorite French films, ""Betty Blue"") and offers her a ride, thinking ""at least she won't cause me any trouble"". Naturally, he's wrong! A clever parable about stereotyping.

Comic actor Roberto Benigni takes the driver's seat as the story moves to Rome. Veteran character actor Paolo Bonacelli (you may recall his memorable turn as Brad Davis' arch-nemesis, the creepy jailhouse toady in ""Midnight Express"") plays a priest who is in for the shock of his life after getting into Benigni's cab. Bonacelli, an actor with a marvelously expressive face, is a joy to watch as he registers steadily increasing horror while Benigni cheerfully and matter-of-factly recounts a lifetime's list of ""sins"" in an unsolicited taxicab Confession that gets exponentially funnier along with the steadily escalating depravity of the acts being described. It's hilarious.

The final segment makes for a bittersweet dessert. Jarmusch pays homage to his favorite director, Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki (I loved his 2002 film ""The Man Without a Past""-a real gem). A Helsinki cab driver (Matti Pellonpa) picks up a trio of working stiffs who are stumbling home after a long night of drinking. The vignette is alternately sad and darkly funny as passengers and driver compete to top each other's sob story in order to establish which one of them is leading the most depressing and miserable existence(some form of traditional Finnish male bonding?). Three of the actors in the piece are Kaurismaki regulars.

Overall, ""Night on Earth"" achieves a satisfying synchronicity as a thoughtful meditation on certain universal truths that govern the human condition, regardless of cultural orientation or geographical location (and delivers it in a much more entertaining and less heavy handed manner than the recent spate of dreary, overrated, self-important ""message"" films like ""21 Grams"", ""Babel"" and the particularly execrable ""Crash"").",1190851200,3,3372,5.212177121771218
697234,4,6303614353,"Jim Jarmusch began the 1990s with Night on Earth and would go on to produce some of his strongest work with Dead Man and Ghost Dog. However, these two films don't quite have the warmth and the humanity abundant in Night on Earth. While he does avoid major Hollywood studios, Jarmusch has no problem collaborating with well known actors. His first experiment was with this film, which featured famous movie stars, Winona Ryder, Gena Rowlands, and Rosie Perez. Jarmusch returned to the structure he used so well in Mystery Train, but expanded its scope. Night on Earth is broken up into five stories that all occur at the same time but in different cities all over the world with the action restricted to taxi cab rides. Jarmusch uses these encounters as springboards for interesting, often hilarious, sometimes tragic discussions ranging from acting in movies to circus clowns to inappropriate acts with farm animals.

After Night on Earth, Jarmusch's methodically paced, dry-witted comedies were no longer en vogue, only to be replaced by a louder, flashier wave of new filmmakers with overt pop culture sensibilities. This film manages to avoid the hackneyed clich of the world weary cabbie to present touching insights into the human condition with situations that run the entire emotional spectrum.

""Q&A with Jim"" features Jarmusch answering questions submitted by fans from all over the world (this was also done on the Down By Law DVD). Among the highlights include him telling an anecdote about a scary moment during the filming in Helsinki. Jarmusch talks about his movie-watching habits and about how he works with actors.

""Alice: Magazine Europeen"" is a brief interview with Jarmusch on Belgian television in 1992. The interview mostly takes place in the back of a moving car as the filmmaker talks about the origins of his film.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by the film's director of photography Frederick Elmes and sound mixer Drew Kunin. The two men talk about the challenge of moving from city to city and how they had to train a new crew in every place. Elmes and Kunin recount many filming anecdotes, like how no actual cabs would stop for Giancarlo Esposito in the NY segment. They provide fascinating insight into making an independent film all over the world.",1189382400,5,2289,4.984293193717278
697235,5,6303614353,"So it only took 16 years for it's first USA release on DVD, but I think it will be worth the wait.  I only recently parted with my VHS copy of this film when Criterion announced it's release.  While obviously I've not seen the release, there is no reason Criterion will disappoint.  For those who haven't seen the film (and I've met dozens of people who still haven't) I believe it to be Jarmusch's best for many reasons.

With five stories (five cabs, five drivers, five cities in the world), all occurring simultaneously, it examines Jarmusch's fascination with the crossing and meeting of cultures and classes.  The film is jammed packed with humor, pathos, sadness, thought provoking stories of people that you actually care about after only 20 minutes and so much more.  Tom Waits (a regular contributor to the work of Jarmusch) does not appear in the film, but wrote the soundtrack instead (so in some ways is in the entire film!).  I would have loved to have seen a 6th story with Waits as the cabbie!!

Every actor is awesome, some giving a career highlight performance, including Winona Ryder, Gena Rowlands, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosie Perez, Roberto Benigni (who was mostly unknown at the time), and several European actors that I've never seen elsewhere, but have never forgotten all these years later.

It's hard for me to pick a favorite story, because like a great short story collection, my favorite keeps changing.  The Italian story (with Benigni) is the slightest story with none of the serious subtext the other stories have, but it is also the funniest, so it's hard not to love it.  Benigni, for me, has never been better.

The final story is almost ""too"" sad, with almost no humor, but the silence, the snow, the heartbreaking story that the cab driver tells, seems to transcend the sadness that shrouds the scene (I could definitely see Bergman doing this story).

The first story is great, with our notions of these two great actresses (Rowlands and Ryder) turned upside down.  Who is vulnerable?  Who is charge of their life?  Who is truly happy?  I'm not sure Jarumsch has ever been called a ""feminist"", but these two women are strong, smart, funny and I can't think of a female writer/director that has written two better characters?  I might have to pick this as my favorite on most of my dozen viewings, but each story has something unique to offer.

For those who have seen Jarmusch's latest films (Broken Flowers and Coffee & Cigarettes), this one is closer to the latter film, but far surpasses it.  While the five stories are diverse (of location, language, style), they are held together with Waits slippery and mysterious music, the passing landscapes outside the taxi cab's windows, and Jarmusch's themes of alienation, existentialism and the basic goodness of people trying to relate to each other even when the odds are against it.

For those who haven't seen this film the wait is, thankfully, almost over.  Thank you Criterion!",1186444800,17,2987,4.850098619329389

If you are a Jim Jarmusch, or Roberto Begnini fan.. you will enjoy this.

The Paris and New York is good too.

697297,5,6303614353,"There isn't much going on in Jim Jarmusch film, but there's a lot happening beneath the surface. Even more than he is a terrific filmmaker and a wonderful screenwriter, Jarmusch is a great observer of human nature. Even though 'Dead Man' and 'Ghost Dog' are the films that gave him more widespread commercial success, these are not typical of his style; Jarmusch's early film hardly have any plot at all, and all they give us is fragments of human lives. His approach towards his characters is always very up-close and personal, but never first-person; the viewer is always an observant, sometimes as comfortable as a close friend, sometimes too close for comfort, almost a voyeur. And yet, with his incredible insight into the human soul and what makes it tick, Jarmusch makes every one of his characters come to full life - even though there are no internal monologues, no revealing close-ups; Jarmusch creates his characters solely through their behavior; and he understands people so well, that in doing so he completely transcends the boundaries of language, culture and nationality.

Like Jarmusch's previous film, 'Mystery Train', 'Night On Earth' gives us several different stories about different characters from different backgrounds. This time, though, there is not the slightest connection between the stories, except a thematic one: we are shown five stories taking place in taxi cabs in five different major cities around the world.

The first story takes place in Los Angeles, and in it is a twenty year old (but she looks seventeen at most!) Winona Ryder, fresh from her break in Beetle Juice and Edward Scissorhands, who plays a young, perky, smart-ass, chain-smoking taxi driver and gives one of the most brilliant performances of her career; opposite her is another terrific actress, Gena Rowlands, as an uptight, busy Hollywood agent.

In the second story, taking place in New York, black Brooklyn native YoYo (Giancarlo Esposito) has a hard time getting a cab in Manhattan, and is finally picked up by Helmut, clown-turned-taxi driver, Eastern German immigrant on his first day at the job (and his first day on an automatic, as well).

The third story is located in Paris, in which Isaac De Bankole (the unforgettable Raymond the ice cream man from 'Ghost Dog') plays a taxi driver who's having a bad day, as he picks up a blind woman (Beatrice Dalle) who doesn't make him feel much better.

The fourth story, taking place in Rome, is practically full-out Italian comedy, with Jarmusch's old friend Roberto Benigni plays a bizarre taxi driver who's giving a bishop (or is he?) a hard time for his money.

Finally, in the fifth story, located in Helsinki, the wonderful Matti Pellonpaa plays Mika, a cheery yet melancholy driver, who picks up three young drunkards and shows to them the true nature of pain.

Each one of these stories has a very distinct and unique atmosphere, ranging from comedy to drama, and revealing, often, the different mentalities of the different countries; the humanity, though, runs all the way through. All of Jarmusch's characters are different and yet the same; they are all equally human, and he understands them all, but each one on their own terms. Jarmusch's observation is always brutally frank and sincere, and always loving and forgiving, for all of his characters equally. Night On Earth is sometimes sad, often funny, mostly touching and always beautiful. There may not be much going on, but it never fails to fascinate.",1119139200,37,3480,5.010380622837371

Life still goes on, however, for the taxi-drivers who move people from one quiet location to another in the wee hours of the night.  The locations are quiet, but the people are not, and the dialogue in this movie is humorous, meaningful, and real.  A temporary bond is formed between passenger and driver (sometimes the roles are even reversed, as in the New York vignette featuring Helmut Grokenberger and YoYo, played by Armin Mueller-Stahl and Giancarlo Esposito, respectively).  Armin Mueller-Stahl, born in 1930, may be relatively unknown to American audiences (as opposed to, say, Rosie Perez), but he did play Vertikoff in the George Clooney flick ""The Peacemaker"" (1997).  Who is the stranger at the wheel who is responsible for bringing one home?  What kind of person drives late at night, waiting for the dispatcher's call to a new address?  A passenger has to pay him or her at the end of the ride, but there is still a feeling of gratitude, and even affection, towards this gruff conveyor of souls.  ""You're a good man, Mika,"" the half-drunk, initially hostile, Finnish workers tell their driver (played by Matti Pellonp) at the end of their journey.  Or a battle of wits takes place, as evidenced by the Paris vignette.  Ivorian actor Isaach De Bankol (who also appears in Jim Jarmusch's ""Coffee and Cigarettes"") is great here as a luckless ""taxiste"" whose prying questions are turned against him by his blind passenger (played by Batrice Dalle).

Always visually very fine, serious in his look at the modern world, and so often funny at the same time.

The opener with Gena Rowlands and Winona Ryder was interesting, at best...I was watching with curiosity at the end. And then canme the New York ride with Armin Muehller-Stahl and Giancarlo Esposito, and I was enthralled...so much so that I didn't notice that I was reading subtitles when they went to Paris with the amazing actress Beatrice Dalle. I became aware during the Rome segment, where the hilarious dialogue went by so quickly I had to read just to keep up. It had the theater in stitches, so I know the rest of the audience was in the same boat. And then the finale in Helsinki. Words can't describe the humor and pathos that dominate here. It's brilliant, and must be seen. Until the final segement, Jarmusch had crafted a well done gentle (most of the time) comedy that focused on people being out of place. With the Helsinki segment, well, it casts a poignant feel over the whole film and forces you to rethink whatyou just saw...
It's brilliant (and also his most accessible film, not including Ghost Dog). Good luck with this wonderful movie.
PS>  I understand why people don't like this review.  It's all just my story, so let me tell you now.  I love this move for the writing and for the brilliant performances my Armin Muehller Stahl and Roberto Bengini (How do you spell that anyway?).  Not to mention Gena Rowlands and Beatrice Dalle.  It's a fantastic movie founded on a great conceit, and well, I love it...hope you do too, and hope that this is more helpful than my CCR tale above.

697462,3,6303614353,"No, this is not a posted sign in the film.  The tobacco companies tried to include it, but Director Jim Jarmusch had too much integrity to allow it.
 ... The tobacco companies saw the script and fronted mass bucks, or actually in this case, for a small Indie episodic venture by a director without a commercial hit to his credit, they fronted small bucks and sent an accountant.
Anyway, this is a collection of five short stories filmed at night in five cities, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki.  In the first, Winona Ryder is an L.A. cabby looking like a ninth-grade grunge girl with her own sweet dreams who picks up Hollywood casting director Gena Rowlands at LAX and takes her to Beverly Hills.  It's a cute idea, their bonding, but Ryder is without subtlety and clichd to the hilt in dark glasses, bubble gum, baseball cap on backwards, and the endless puffing, talking sarcastically out of the side of her mouth: ""All right, MOM.""  I actually expected some Joan Jett and the Blackhearts in the background.  Rowland is very good however and overcomes a cloying script.
In New York, veteran German character actor Armin Mueller-Stahl, looking for all the world like a dead ringer for Albert Einstein, is the cabby, Helmut, and Giancarlo Esposito is Yoyo, his fare.  Problem is Helmut drives with one foot on the gas pedal and the other on the brake so that the cab starts and stops every two seconds.  So they switch positions.  Meanwhile Rosie Perez arrives for a cameo.
In Paris, Isaach De Bankol is the cabby and blind Batrice Dalle, in white zombie contact lenses, is his fare.  This is perhaps the best piece.  Bankol, who is a black dude from the Ivory Coast, asks her kindly, ""Don't blind people usually wear dark glasses?""  She has the great rejoinder, ""Do they?  I've never seen a blind person.""
Roberto Benigni is the cabby in Rome.  He picks up a priest and to the priest's great discomfort confesses in vivid detail his rather revolting sexual experiences.
Finally in Helsinki we have Matti Pellonp as the ""taksi"" driver.  The stark lighting on the snow and the empty streets captures well the cold northern night.  Incidentally, the European stories are done in the local language with subtitles.
This is obviously an art film and requires a relatively sophisticated audience.  The editing isn't sharp (some of that's deliberate) and the dialogue is uneven, but some of the camera work is excellent.  See it for the acting, which is mostly very good.",1014854400,4,2483,4.761682242990654
697463,5,6303614353,"This film is one of my all-time favorites.
Night on earth is about power and the silliness of our assumptions about social status, being in control, sexual mores, power and moral strength.
We are still not too far from the animal world, but instead of brute force, we use social conventions to establish a pecking order in every situation. We move into any social environment with some expectations about our place in it relative to the status of others.
Night on earth is a little study of these expectations. Every one of the episodes has a beautiful triangle of power, morals and expectations. Being a structure freak myself, there is nothing I can appreciate more than good structure.
The cabbie - the casting agent - her boss/client in LA
The cabbie - Yoyo - his sister-in-law in New York
The cabbie - the priest - the transvestites in Rome
The cabbie - the diplomats - the blind girl in Paris
The cabbie - the drunk - his friends in Helsinki
The casting agent of the LA story is socially superior to the dirty little cabbie girl (played delightfully by Winona Rider;) but we soon learn that she is not on top; she is a slave of the demands of her job, the whims of her boss/client. When she tries to assert her status by condescending to the cabbie girl the whole structure of assumptions falls apart. Status is meaningless if you do not want it. In the end the true strength award goes to Corky.
We see the same idea evolving in the other episodes as well.
Every story starts with an assumption, an assumption of social order that first gets twisted then turned completely upside down. This twist and turn is played out with flawless consistency in each episode.
Whichever character appears to be the weakest in the setup of our social assumptions turns out to be the strongest by the end of the ride.
I will not bore you analyzing them all and you do not need to see it for its `deeper meaning.' This is one those wonderful movies that can entertain at any level. I've never seen Roberto Benigni this funny or Rosie Perez this cute and sexy.
Without question this is my favorite Jarmusch movie, and I am sure your will like it too. Do not miss it!",1002067200,3,2155,4.486005089058525
697464,3,6303614353,"Winona Ryder's acting in the first (L.A.) segment is forced and unnatural, and the story is too cliche and predictable. The New York portion was a little better, but not by much. Paris and Rome, I think were definitely the most watchable, particularly thanks to the acting--Roberto Benigni is to be noted here.
However, my heart belongs to the Helsinki segment which gave exposure to this otherwise forgotten corner of the earth. I felt at home while watching it, and this was largely achieved by the use of the Finnish language. This is rare in a mainstream film. Naturally, the cliches of Finland as a land of permanent frost and drunkards had to sneak in, but that didn't really mess with the overall experience.",994982400,,715,4.774193548387097
697465,5,6303614353,"Rarely does a film make me laugh out loud -- this one did. The film is also at times very touching, which is really an accomplishment to do inside the same film.  The funniest of the five segments was the one set in Paris.  This is because unlike the New York and particularly the Rome segments, it was not obviously played for laughs.  Isaach De Bankol, who plays the Parisian taxi driver is right on the money.  His interplay with Batrice Dalle is perfect. I was even more impressed with his work in this film after seeing him again in Jarmusch's GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI playing a very different character.  The closing segment, which was set in Helinski, I found the most moving.  Jarmusch, who is a true maverick filmmaker, is his most accessible here.  If you've never seen his work before, this is a great place to start.",973468800,,837,4.467105263157895
697466,4,6303614353,"This movie is a great film from Jim Jarmusch. It really involves multiple-story lines all interwoven.  In that respect, it reminds me much  of ""Mystery Train.""
Features brief glimpses into the lives of  multiple taxi cab drivers, each in various parts of the world.  It is all  pretty funny.  But also reminiscent of ""taxi cab confessions.""  Literally, in the case of the Italy scene(s)/story.
What's the best part  about this movie?  I'd venture to say it would have to be the soundtrack.  Good ol' Tom Waits.  Fits perfectly.
You'll enjoy it.",966988800,,544,4.868131868131868
697467,2,6303614353,"I rented this video with high hopes, being a fan especially of Benigni.  I was appalled at the stilted dialogue in the first scene, with Winona  Ryder's performance reminding me more of a bad high school drama class than  anything else.
Things didn't get much better, with the exception of a  short (8 minutes?) scene with two black businessmen and a taxi driver from  Cote D'Ivoire, which was rather funny and had a great French pun which I  will not spoil for readers.  But this scene segued (degenerated?) into a  scene with a crass blind woman and more forced dialogue.
Finally, Benigni  carries his scene as the confessing taxi driver, which was entertaining  mostly for his delivery and the fact that it's in Italian.  Otherwise, as  another reviewer pointed out, it's a rehashed standup comedy act.
Overall, the film had little finesse, no depth, and badly developed  characters. While I'm a fan of true cinema and not much of a TV watcher, I  can say that ""Night on Earth"" doesn't hold a candle to a much  deeper, candid, and scintillating look at the human personality: HBO's  Taxicab Confessions.",966816000,9,1106,4.803191489361702
697468,3,6303614353,"The second vignette, based in New York, was quite funny and touching, but the rest of the film was not at this level.
