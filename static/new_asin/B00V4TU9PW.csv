8709164,1,B00V4TU9PW,"One star is generous. It feels like the producer hashed this ""documentary"" together from ancient vas stock. The video quality is awful. It was assembled using Apple's DVD authoring software. There's one decent group interview, from just before ""The Dance"", that I've never seen before. The rest is a lift from CBS' Sunday Morning show, complete with logo in the lower corner. The voiceover reads her script as if she's in elementary school delivering her book report. There are no credits or acknowledgements, except on the back cover. I think even those might be questionable considering the awful quality and even more awful editing of the video. There's no runtime printed to let you know if it's 15mins, 90 mins, 120mins or whatever.

I didn't expect much considering the low cost, but I did expect it to be better than it is.",1434412800,11,830,4.845070422535211
8709165,1,B00V4TU9PW,"Literally three interviews(all found on YouTube by the way) and some short footage that has the worst narrator. The whole thing is 45 minutes long. Waste of money, I was hoping it was a new updated documentary on the Mac. Save your money and just search for Fleetwood Mac interview videos on YouTube.",1433808000,17,300,4.679245283018868
8709166,1,B00V4TU9PW,"Basically all interviews with only a snippet of their music...

Don't spend your money or waste your time on this pathetic drivel...

Shame on Fleetwood Mac!!!",1433808000,4,159,5.076923076923077
