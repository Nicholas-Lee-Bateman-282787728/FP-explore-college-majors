8579036,4,B00CA4S3AI,"I can't think of two different films to release as a double feature. POOR PRETTY EDDIE details the exploits of a demented backwoods wannabe Elvis (Michael Christian) who captures and sexually assaults Leslie Uggams when her expensive car breaks down. Contains many memorable scenes and a cast of old pros (none who are with us anymore) and an ending you won't soon forget. CARNIVAL MAGIC is director Al Adamson's next-to-last film that is a G-Rated rip-off of E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, but instead of an alien, there is a talking chimp! Be aware that EDDIE is in anamorphic widescreen, while MAGIC is in fullscreen, unusual for a Blu-Ray film made after 1953.",1409270400,,661,4.963963963963964
8579037,5,B00CA4S3AI,"The folks at Film Chest did a stellar job restoring these hard to film obscure gems!

This set contains both blu-ray and DVD's of each film in its own  blu-ray case, housed in a collecatble slipsleave (so that a total of 4 discs in this set)

These films have been very hard to fild on home video over the years, actually this is the first time Carnival Magic has been avalible on home video, as original 35 MM print was discovered in an old wrehouse!

These are great restorations for what they are, don't expect the look of high budget films bcause they are not.

Poor Pretty Eddie is in anamophic widescreen and Carnival Magic is in listed as standard but is a anamorphic presentation!

Poor Pretty Eddie has an informative audio commentary with Joe Rubin and cameraman David Worth and the trailer for the film,
 and Carnival Magic has a commentary with Joe Rubin and producer Elvin Feltner, an interview with Elvin Feltner, slideshow, some rare outakes (no audio), and some trailers for the film.
Both come with before and after restiration demos.

this product come highly recommended!",1368403200,3,1090,4.73015873015873
