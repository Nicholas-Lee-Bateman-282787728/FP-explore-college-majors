8148818,5,B000J39G3U,"I have to confess I've had a thing for Pamela Sue Martin ever since she was ""Nancy Drew"" back in the '70s. I hadn't seen her in anything for years, so I was delighted to view the video of this movie in VHS format when a relative recently checked it out of a church library. (Films like this are why I bought a dual VCR/DVD region-free player, and a DVD is also now available).

Aside from my interest in Ms. Martin however, I can recommend this movie as an enjoyable film for the whole family. I found it more interesting to watch as an American because it was filmed in Australia by an Australian studio. It seems fairly well written and kept my attention throughout. It has lots of suspense (in a Disney sort of way) as everyone wonders if a satellite will crash and release its deadly contents. Plus there are spies about and not everyone is who they seem.

This was made in 1990, so the computers and space technology are quite dated now. I'm sure your kids will notice that right off. But who cares? It's the story that's important. Just tell them that all you have to do is put yourself in a 1990 mindset and enjoy it for its time period - that's the technology you would have had to deal with if you were living this story.

The children in the film are the central focus of course, but as an adult I could still enjoy that. Didn't you want to be a hero when you were a kid? You can live it again through this movie.",1323648000,2,1423,4.205128205128205
