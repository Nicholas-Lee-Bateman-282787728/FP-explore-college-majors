8699030,5,B00SOPOT8C,"Following on from season 2, these OVAs will carry on the excitement. In the first OVA, Keima helps out some of his class in order for them to pass the upcoming test! But it turns out that they're all former conquests! In the second and third OVAs, Keima confronts a girl from the past? The fourth OVA is a spin-off from the main series, where Kanon has mysteriously been made younger and battles demons with the power of song!",1438992000,,426,4.405063291139241

8699033,5,B00SOPOT8C,"A great collection of every KamiNomi OVA ever made, and concludes the US releases of this fan-favorite series.

First of all you have the ""Tenri-Arc"", a storyline revolving around Keima's shy childhood friend from season 1. We also get an introduction  to two of the most endearing ""bad guys"", which much like ""Team Rocket"" from ""Pokemon"", always fails in the funniest ways possible. A cute, but more serious arc than the first two seasons.

Then we have the ""Yonin to Aidoru"" episode, which is basicly just a spot-on parody of ""K-On"". Chihiro tries to make an after school music club, but needs more members to get approved by the school. She teams up with her three best friends, but none of these can play any instruments. Even worse, they have to challenge Kanon!

At last, the ""Kanon 100%"" episode. It's a parody of the ""Magical Girl"" genre, with the in-series idol ""Kanon"" turning into a child and has to find a way to turn back into the way she was. There's also a Kaketama (Runaway soul) making troubles for everyone, so it's up to ""Magical Girl Kanon"" to save the day! It is based on the spin-off manga of the same name and does a pretty good job at referencing every cliche in this type of Anime. As it is a spin-off, Keima doesn't have much of a role here, but it works great as a OVA episode.

I recommend this to both KamiNomi fans and fans of comedy Anime. Lots of parodies/references, has a very charming soundtrack and isn't that expensive. 25$ for just 4 episodes may seem a little much, but it's the cheapest alternative we have (Pssst! 100$ for all these in Japan!!!). The only downside is that the two ""music videos"" are missing. These have original animation and are based on songs from the single CDs. They're basicly fanservice galore though (especially the Kanon one), so you won't be missing much.",1431907200,5,1822,4.593846153846154
8699034,5,B00SOPOT8C,Like TWGOK? Pick this up!,1431648000,,25,4.2
8699035,5,B00SOPOT8C,A must have for me since it drives me nuts when I can't get OVAs that include plot which is often a problem with anime.  A great series based on a great manga.,1430956800,,159,3.8181818181818183
