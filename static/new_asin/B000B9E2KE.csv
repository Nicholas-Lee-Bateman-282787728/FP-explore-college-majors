It just takes some time to get to it.

FILM REVIEW

Effects is a collaboration of friends who wanted to make a fun horror film on the cheap. Scrounging up some loose change (when was $55,000 ever considered loose change?), some friends of George A. Romero (RIP) got together and made a horror film guerilla style. Effects is a bit on the slow end and takes some time to get going, but once the film reveals its true intention, it becomes a no holds barred intense ride to the final minute. If you can manage to get through the first slowish 1 hour, the final 20 minutes make the film much better. In fact, after the ending rolled around, I wanted to watch the film again to pick up on what I missed. That says something.

Effects stars a bunch of people you may or may not know. Right away you are going to notice the main lead, Joseph Pilato, who starred as the evil Rhodes in Day of the Dead. (Funny enough, the film Night of the Living Dead is mentioned in Effects.) Also showing up is Tom Savini playing a sleazeball and John Harrison, who directed several Tales from the Darkside episodes and the Darkside movie. Horror films will be getting a kick out of seeing some early acting work from some notable genre staples.

It certainly appears that Effects was shot on the lower end of the budget scale, with smaller sets and some stilted acting. However, the heart and soul that was put into getting this film made shows up on screen, and the film turned out to be a much better movie than many other low budget films of its time. Its a damn shame the film had such a troubled history getting it distributed as I think it would have taken off if given the opportunity.

VIOLENCE

Effects isn't a violent film. Any time blood appears on screen its usually a prop being tested out for the film within the film. The flick tends to shy away from the practical effects, which is funny given the name of the movie and the people behind it.

SEX/NUDITY

We start things off pretty good with a soapy shower, eventually leading into some boobs during a snuff film, and a few sexual interactions being filmed without prior consent. We don't see much more, though, save for some hairy legs and a mans butt. Sadly, no Tom Savini nudity to be found.

INTERESTING ELEMENTS

-Audiences are dumb and want blood flying everywhere. I actually agree.
-What in the hell kind of film were they pretending to film?
-That sudden ending!

BLU-RAY REVIEW

VIDEO

American Genre Film Archive (AGFA) has released Effects on a Blu-ray package that features a rough video transfer. Nevertheless, the film has been cleaned up by doing a 4K scan of the only 35mm theatrical print in existence. There are numerous instances of dirt and debris, but this only gives the film a more proper low budget, snuff film look. To me, this is one time where a poor transfer helps the movie.

AUDIO

Audio fares better with DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0  and has no apparent hiss and distortion occurring, at least not enough to distract from your listening experience.

EXTRA FEATURES

The Blu-ray features a 1 hour documentary on the film titled After Effects, which was shot in 2004. It features interviews with everyone involved in the making of the film, along with George A. Romero. There is an optional commentary from Michael Felsher, who shot the documentary. Rounding out the features are two short films by John Harrison and Dusty Nelson, and finally an archival commentary track with John Harrison, Dusty Nelson, and Pasquale.

AGFA, along with MVD Entertainment Group, has done a splendid job releasing Effects on Blu-ray and fans will finally get to see this interesting horror film the way it was meant to be seen.",1504051200,2,4630,4.70631970260223
8083835,3,B000B9E2KE,"Horror fans know already what it means when you hear the words Pittsburgh and horror in the same sentence: NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Yes all of the zombie films created by director George Romero were created and filmed in that area. But he wasn't alone.

Alongside Romero were a group of friends who decided that if he could make a feature film they could do so as well. They had worked with him and watched how it was done. Now to make a movie on their own. With local make-up legend Tom Savini, who had done the special effects make-up on Romeros DAWN OF THE DEAD and the movie MANIAC, what better topic to use than effects?

In addition to that at the time in the early 80s there was a large amount of attention being paid to snuff films, movies that were supposed to have filmed actual murders and seen only by viewers willing to pay the high price to watch them. Not to mention being some sick individuals.

The story here is of a low budget film crew working on a horror film in a remote location in Pennsylvania. As viewers we would think that something is amiss right away as scenes are combined that would not have been shot a particular way but that would have been edited to appear as they do. But the film makers here have decided to set that aside for the moment.

As the movie progresses we realize that there is a movie being shot within the movie as well. The director of the initial movie, Lacy (John Harrison), is shooting behind the scenes with hidden cameras placed all over the house and area. A trip to a secluded basement area finds him meeting with the crew he has watching over what happens on various monitors.

The story takes several turns and twists as we begin to wonder just how far Lacey is willing to go for either of his movies. Is he just shooting items for a making of type special or does he have something more going on? When he sits with the cinematographer of the initial film Dom (Joe Pilato) to unspool for him an actual snuff film, we start to wonder if perhaps that isn't his goal in the end. With that in mind the questions of who will survive and who is in on the whole thing come to mind.

The main question becomes is the movie any good or not? Well yes and no. The quality of the film is much in tune with low budget films from the time period. Colors seem washed out at times and no amount of restoration can change some of the filming that was done. The acting ranges from quite good to passable. The effects are very bad, which is odd for a movie called EFFECTS. Few effects are used in the film if at all and when they are its most often to show how the effects would work in the initial film.

What makes the movie interesting from a fan point of view is that it comes from what could be termed the Romero school of film making. The methods used here were the same he used and he even gave advice to them while they were making the film. An extra included here has footage of the cast members talking about making the movie, some at what appears to be a backyard part for them to get together at which Romero appears to have attended.

In the end I couldn't whole heartedly recommend this film for everyone. But fans of Romero and the type of guerilla film making he did early on will want to check this out. Horror fans will want to give it a look. And completest will want to add it to their horror collections.",1503878400,,3367,4.233644859813084
8083836,3,B000B9E2KE,"Effects is a film put together on a miniscule budget by friends of the late director, George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead). A group of filmmakers high on cocaine including Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead), Joe Pilato (Day of the Dead), and John Harrison (Tales From the Darkside: The Movie) gather in Pittsburgh to make a slasher flick called Duped: The Snuff Movie. As filming begins and accidents occur, it becomes clear that something isn't right. No one can be trusted.

Savini is the best known actor in the film. Starting as a make-up artist specializing is grisly special effects, he turned to acting, and has appeared in mostly horror films since his acting debut in Martin (1978). Intrigued by Man of a Thousand Faces, the screen biopic of Lon Chaney, Savini became fascinated with the magic of illusion on film. Later, as a combat photographer in Vietnam, he saw firsthand gruesome carnage which he then gained fame simulating on screen.

Effects has taken a long time getting to the public. When it was filmed in 1978, the original distributor shelved it. Further delays occurred because of rights issues, and the movie wasn't released until 2005. As a horror film, it doesnt have the same intensity as slasher films of the 80s. The first part is fairly slow moving, with more drug use than horror. The film combines voyeurism and horror, which was typical of grindhouse movies of the time.

Assembling these Romero alumni sounds like a better idea than the film that resulted. Though the acting is reasonably good, it never achieves the scare factor that horror fans crave and is more interesting as a genre footnote.

The R-rated widescreen Blu-ray release is a new 4K scan from the only 35-mm theatrical print. Bonus materials include a making-of documentary, commentary track, and early short films.",1503532800,,1818,4.87378640776699
8083837,4,B000B9E2KE,"History has it that Effects, which was filmed in 1978, was never released back in the day upon completion as the original distributor decided to shelve it, so it had to wait until an official release until the 2000s. And while the film's by no means a masterpiece one really wonders why - basically, the film plays like a good example of the (then-waning) grindhouse era, mixing violence and sexy bits to hang them up on a rather thin storyline - which admittedly might speak to nostalgia-afficianados like me way more than to then contemporary audiences. And while the film isn't perfectly structured by any means, it does feature a highly original and rather exciting finale, plus in a macabre way it does anticipate today's fascination with reality TV.
That all said, still don't expect a masterpiece - but fun nostalgic genre entertainment at the very least.",1501027200,4,862,4.870748299319728
8083838,4,B000B9E2KE,the dvd was okay. my goal is to see most of the horror from the 80's,1481760000,,68,3.3125
8083839,5,B000B9E2KE,"This was quite a find for me. It is a nice ""slice"" of late 1970's independent film making from alot of George A. Romero's alumni. The other two reviews are very critical of this film and I am not quite sure why?! It is in no way a graphic film like ""Last House On The Left"", yet it does give off the same ""snuff"" feel with pretty good acting and direction. The soundtrack is great too. Kudos to Synapse for this release.
John Harrison who stars in this film also did the music as well as the soundtracks for ""Creepshow"" and ""Day Of The Dead"".",1221955200,5,542,4.171428571428572
8083840,1,B000B9E2KE,"Due to a problem with the distributor this film was never actually released until 2005 when Synapse Films put it out on DVD. It's clear to me that this movie was meant to stay buried, because there are far more problems here than simple distribution. Based on a novel by William H. Mooney, the film details a film crew as they make a horror film, but begin to suspect that the killings are real and that they are actually in a snuff movie,thought up by the devious producer. I honestly only gave this movie a shot because Tom Savini has a role in it and I figured he have a hand  in ther make-up effects, which usually means we'll get some pretty gory scenes. That's sadlynot the case here, Tom role is some jerky crewmember that nobody likes, and the only bloody sequences  we get involves a man being shot in the head, and it's only revealed to be a scene in the movie  the crew is making. In fact, there are many scenes that confuse the viewer and gives you a hard time distinguishing which is the movie and which is the movie there making. It becomes rather annoying after the third time. The film's pacing is incredibly slow, with a lot of relatively pointless scenes that just seem to drag on and on. Sometimes annoying music plays overhead to make the scenes even less watchable. The only parts of the film that are worth watching is the extreme close-up T&A we get in the beginning and towards the end when the story picks up and the thruth behind the film production is revealed. With its slow pacing, dubious acting, and numerous pointless sequences, it's no wonder this movie took 25 years to be released. It should have stayed Dead and Buried!",1151020800,6,1655,4.455445544554456
8083841,2,B000B9E2KE,"""Effects"" is a better idea than it is a movie.  The first hour is a group of people rambling about making a horror movie with a lot of drug-use, and nothing really happens except snippets of voyeurism that isn't scary or intersting.

The final half hour picks up, but it's predictable.  Not a gory movie, but instead a psychological one.  If the pacing was better and more events happened in the movie before the final ten minutes, ""Effects"" would've been enjoyable, but it was too BORING for me to ever watch again.

Curiousity killed me on this one.",1139529600,5,551,4.581632653061225
