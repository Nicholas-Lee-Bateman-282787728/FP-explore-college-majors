6597557,1,B00MP2FRT0,"These movies are some of the worst I have ever seen. I have seen both. And believe me, I am not just some butthurt fan of the books. While they were nothing like the books, they were terrible in other ways.
Both movies had a lack of talent in the acting department, as well as a choppy story and a lack of character development. They also don't even seem to know Greek mythology. A good example:
Percy( son of Poseidon, talking to Kronos)- "" I'm going to kill you with this sword, the one my father used to kill you.""
Just Google Kronos' death and you will find out how terrible this quote is.
Aside from the bad writing, they are nothing like the book. I went to the theater just to see Lightning Thief. After that, I rented Sea of Monsters, as I was wise enough not to see the creepy effects on a big screen. Both of these films left me disappointed.
So, if Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, and Divergent weren't accurate enough for you, watch these movies!",1418428800,3,958,4.298342541436464
6597558,5,B00MP2FRT0,"The two Percy Jackson movies were, in my opinion, two of the best movies ever made! They have everything: Action, humour, fantasy, and drama. These movies are among the most compelling movies I've ever seen and are truly an amazing I would recommend these movies to anyone of any age group. If you like movies such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, the X-Men, and The Avengers, then you will definitely like the Percy Jackson movies.

Logan Lerman plays Percy Jackson who is the son of Posiedon, the God of the Sea. In the first movie, Percy's mother is kidnapped by Hades, and Percy goes on a quest to rescue her. Along the way he must gather the 3 pearls of Persephone (Hades' wife) which give you the ability to leave the Underworld, which is where Percy's mother is being held by Hades. Percy is suspected of stealing Zeus' lightning bolt, which Hades wants for himself. So Percy must go to the Underworld to convince Hades that he is not the lightning thief and plea with Hades for the release of his mother. Percy's quest brings him into contact with all sorts of villains including Meduse herself, a fire-breathing Hydra, and the Lotus eaters (who lure people into their lair for all eternity with addictive Lotus flowers which are basically like a drug).

In the second Percy Jackson movie, Percy must venture to the Sea Of Monsters, otherwise known to humans as the Bermuda Triangle, in order to recover the Golden Fleece, a blanket which can heal any creature, living or dead. The reason is because Luke, the son of Hermes (and the real lightning thief from the first movie), has poisoned the tree which generates the invisible protective barrier that guards Camp Half Blood, Percy's home, from all the mythical monsters that seek to kill the demigods who live there. Along the way Percy must battle all sorts of monsters, as well as Luke and his gang. Luke seeks the Golden Fleece for himself in order to revive Kronos, the most evil monster that ever lived. Percy ultimately must face and kill Kronos to prevent Kronos from destroying Olympus and the entire world.",1412553600,7,2070,4.699724517906336
