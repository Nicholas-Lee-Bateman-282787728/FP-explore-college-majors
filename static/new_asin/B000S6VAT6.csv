8204577,5,B000S6VAT6,"I found the video very helpful.  I'm not surprised a Muslim didn't like it.  I once read a book by a Muslim on Christianity and felt they completely misrepresented the facts of historical Christian doctrine.  At any rate, it is worth the watch.  Then go to primary sources and make the decision for yourself.",1420416000,,308,4.648148148148148
8204578,1,B000S6VAT6,"I don't like that Amazon says my review is ""I hate it."" I don't hate anything. This is a case of ""buyer-beware."" The description describes Dr. Morey as a scholar, and although his scholarship in Christianity is very solid, he is certainly not a scholar of Islam and is in fact an evangelical activist who has disseminated much anti-Islamic literature. A serious and honest inquiry of the subject of Jihad or anything related to Islam should be directed to the Qur'an itself and the authentic Hadith (traditions and sayings) of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). I recommend consulting the most authentic collections of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, and speaking to an Islamic scholar. Dr. Morey et al are free to articulate his position, and I do not begrudge him of that, nor do I have anything harsh or negative to say about the followers or scholars of Christianity or Judaism, but as I would suggest consulting with scholarly writings about those two faiths, so too do I suggest that anyone making a serious inquiry into anything Islamic consult the appropriate sources. Let's all learn to understand each other rather than misguided fear mongering and stoking of controversy.",1406505600,,1176,4.974619289340102
