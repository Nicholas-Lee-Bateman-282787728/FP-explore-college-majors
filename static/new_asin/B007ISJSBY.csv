8517773,5,B007ISJSBY,Came quickly and in perfect condition. Packed with another item which I love since it saves on box's and extra room with in the packaging.,1386979200,,138,4.56
8517774,5,B007ISJSBY,This is a great tribute to those that gave their all in a terrifying war. No other war can compare to the First World War. It was a tragic waste of human life and this documentary illustrates it well.,1383264000,,200,4.153846153846154
8517775,1,B007ISJSBY,"The description of this ""Collection"" is very deceiving.  In reality, it is not a ""collection"", but rather two individual DVD's bundled together: ""Voices of WWI"" and ""WWI - The War to End All Wars"".  Nowhere does the description state this simple fact.  I actually owned both of these DVD's so I sent the ""Collection"" back.",1365379200,,322,4.818181818181818
8517776,5,B007ISJSBY,I would recomend this collection to anyone who is interested in WWI history and actual events. I never knew there were so many films made during this war.,1361577600,,154,4.535714285714286
8517777,4,B007ISJSBY,Only watched selected portions of this set so far.  Good information and well researched presentation.  I am pleased with this purchase and will consider additional dvd's as the budget permits.,1361491200,5,193,5.4
8517778,3,B007ISJSBY,"The narration in this production is a bit tedious However, as an explanation of events of the war, quite complete. In fact, to absorb it all, you might have to view this several times. What I found totally disappointing was the repetition of the footage. Some scenes maybe as often as five or six times on one disc and repeated on the other discs almost as often. When repeated, the scenes didn't fit with the narration and, many times, the narration would be on the subject of French troops and the scene would be of British Troops! I am presently watching ""The last Voices of WW1"" And I recommend you spend your money on that instead of this.

8517779,2,B007ISJSBY,"I have seen some very good WWI war documentaries however this was not one of them, it will put you to sleep which is not a bad thing if that is what you're looking for. I was reading a review for another DVD and the person made the comment ""you get what you pay for"" well this is a clear example of that, even for the low price I would not purchase this DVD again.

8517780,4,B007ISJSBY,"This is a great idea by Mill Creek entertainment, putting these two Documentary Series together on one DVD Set. On this Set you'll find the following series: WWI-THE WAR TO END ALL WARS and LAST VOICES OF WWI-A GENERATION LOST. This 5-Disc collection contains 11 Hours of interesting Documentaries about the war that shaped the 20th century, World War I. This war comes to life through rare, actual battle footage and testimonials from more than 100 WWI veterans. If, like me, you enjoy watching Historical documentaries and if you enjoy learning more about the great wars then this DVD Set will be a wonderful addition to your collection. The interviews with the veterans are great and are really worth the watch. I highly recommend this collection. :)

-- Documentary 1: WWI-THE WAR TO END ALL WARS ( 3 DVD, 7 Hours, 10 Episodes )
WWI: The War To End All Wars is a unique, 10-part, comprehensive look at the war that shaped the 20th Century. Through rare, actual battle footage and rare veteran interviews, The War To End All Wars takes you from the assassination of the Austrian Arch Duke in 1914, to the final desperate battles of 1918. Unique and stunning, you will ""go-over-the-top"" on the Western Front and witness the carnage in Russia. You'll take to the skies in the world's first air war and ride with the legendary Lawrence of Arabia. This is more than a historical or military account of WWI, it is a riveting and personal account of a defining moment in world history. Never before in the history of the world had so many countries fought on so many far-flung battlefields. Never had so many soldiers lost their lives. Never had there been such an unending hell-on-earth. Never has there been such a remarkable look at 'The War to End All Wars'.

-- Documentary 2: LAST VOICES OF WWI-A GENERATION LOST ( 2 DVD, 4 Hours, 6 Episodes )
The Last Voices of the First World War is a unique and harrowing six-part documentary series featuring testimonials from more than 100 WWI veterans.  This culmination of interviews captured over the last 15 years has been put together in one series for the first time, along with historic newsreel footage and dramatic reconstructions. The series won a Royal Television Society Documentary Award (2009), praised for providing a unique historical record of a lost generation. These quietly courageous men speak with stoicism in the face of unimaginable horror that is both humbling and inspiring. The contrast between the youthful optimism of volunteers and the unprecedented slaughter to come provides a deeply personal view of the British experience of the most traumatic war in human history.

8517781,5,B007ISJSBY,"I ordered both of these thinking they were new. However (""WW1 The Great War Documentary Collection"") is actually the same thing as (""WW1 The War to End All Wars"") and also includes (""The Last Voices of WW1 a Generation Lost""). Also with the ""History of the Western Frontier"" Myth and Legend Stripped Away and the Truth Revealed"" you might already own it also as it is the same thing as ""American History of the Wild West"" 12 Documentary Set"" So be careful you don't already own both of these.
