334689,1,6301578848,"MPI's DVD edition of this video feature has serious audio problems: the dialogue is distorted and impossible to make out, like a radio with very poor reception.  (MPI made a similar mess of their DVD version of 1973's ""Picture of Dorian Gray"").",1141776000,4,244,4.809523809523809
334690,2,6301578848,"Part of ""Nightmare Classics' exective-produced by Shelley Duvall, 'Turn of the Screw' (1990) is a made-for-TV adaptation of Henry James classic.  The 60 minute program features Amy Irving, David Hemmings, and young Balthazar Getty (probably his debut).  The director is Graeme Clifford ('Frances').

The story is basically the same as the original, but the impression you get from the adaptation is quite different.  It's about a governess (Irving) coming to work at Bly Manor estate, the gentleman who hires her (Hemmings) and the two children (the boy played by Getty) in her care.

Now I quote from the backcover of VHS: ""Believing that two young orphans in her care have come under the evil, depraved influence of the manor's resident ghost, the sexually repressed governess becomes obsessed with saving the children from what she sees as a mortal threat to their very souls.""  Well, that's what they say, the people of Cannon Video (remember this company?).

But why 'sexually repressed'?  Because, in this filmed version, Amy Irving's heroine (and the director) makes it explicit that she is quite so.  In fact, she often sees sexually suggestive images (in restraunts or the kids's actions), and the film shows many pieces of art in the mansion, many of which happen to be pictures of naked women.  That means, when the ghost(s) appear, they don't appear like in 'The Sixth Sense' or 'The Others.'  At one scene, these ghosts (one male, another female) are seen lying and hugging each other, in the sexually repressed governess's bed.  How horrible, isn't it?

The film is not scary at all.  The ghosts are more campy than scary, and that's not the only bad thing about the film.  The Bly Manor estate doesn't look like a haunted mansion, but like a big house in California with a Spanish garden.  Amy Irving sports a British accent, which is quite unnecessary, and the bland way these 'ghosts' appear is simply terrible, leaving no  emotional impact to us.

Probably the film is interesting in providing us with a chance to see young Balthazar Getty, who is to be famous with more complex roles in 'Lost Highway' and other films.  He is good here, but not remarkable like Hemmings or other actors.  But you cannot blame them; the film made a wrong decision to be something it couldn't be.  Though it is true that Henry James's original novella allows you to relate the governess' frequent witnessing of ghosts to her repressed sexual desire, you just cannot do it on screen.

If you want to see this Henry James story on screen, see 'The Innocents' instead.  That's an old film, but better than this.",1124496000,4,2608,4.850678733031674

334692,4,6301578848,"Though I appear to be a minority, I'd like to praise this version of  ""The Turn of the Screw,"" not because I think it's an improvement  over the 1961 film version, ""The Innocents,"" but because I think  it succeeds in the context of its own particular medium: videotape. True,  this rendering of Henry James is not ""cinematic"" in the usual  sense, but the very nature of videotape precludes the stylistic approach of  celluloid. What this version lacks in the verisimilitude of exterior  settings, it more than compensates for in terms of intimacy of atmosphere  (the main virtue of videotaped productions), so that I encountered a mood  of claustrophobia lacking in theatrical versions. In fact, this ""Turn  of the Screw,"" like Dan Curtis's 1968 version of ""Jekyll and  Hyde"" (and like the BBC videotape of ""Count Dracula"")  carries much of the directness of on-stage drama: precisely because of its  technical lack of ""polish,"" it draws the viewer into a more  authentic sense of involvement. As for the acting, here, too, I have to  partially differ, since I feel Lynn Redgrave gave a fine and measured  performance (not over-the-top, as some reviews have stated). If I had any  quarrel with the acting, it was with Jasper Jacob as ""Miles,""  because the actor looked 4 or 5 years too old for the role. Still, his  performance was passable, and as for Eva Griffith, her ""Flora""  was superb; Griffith's face, moreover, has remarkable sensuality for a  child actress, which makes the gradual onset of libertine possession all  the more believable. In short, this is one of my favorite adaptations of a  famous horror novel which, whatever its flaws, is one I'd love to have on  DVD.",965606400,22,1681,4.879432624113475
334693,2,6301578848,"The majority of the feature takes place in the countryside near Essex, in Great Britain.  The haunted grounds of Bligh House give one the idea of mystery.  The setting enhances the mood of the story and also provides for  the development of each character's fear and personality.  There are  several forbidden places within the foreboding Bligh House.  Many sealed  rooms, uneeded for living, are the origin of unnatural voices in the night.  The rooftop is also a place of mystery.  An ancient clock tower guards  secrets of past inhabitants.  The large, empty house is the perfect setting  for an encounter with the dead.  It reinforces the aura of evil.  These  places, coupled with nighttime and stormy weather greatly add to feelings  experienced by the viewers.  The strength of setting is one of only a few  above average points of this film.",944784000,5,849,4.900709219858156
334694,2,6301578848,"Turn of the Screw is a horror film based on the idea of two deceased adults who have come back from the dead to try to steal the soul's of two children whom they knew while they were alive.  The plot of the story  served its purpose as a horror film, but the acting is atrocious.  In  particular was the character Mrs. Cubberly.  she plays a nanny to two young  children, Flora and Miles.  The two children used to be close with Peter  Quint and Ms. Jessel, the two ghosts who have come back to haunt the  mansion before they passed away.  Mrs. Cubberly is the only person, besies  Flora and Miles that can see Peter Quint and Ms. Jessel.  The looks upon  her face every time she catches a glimpse of either of them is a fake look  of horror.  The way the camera come supon her and the look upon her face is  an amateurish style that you would only expect from an incompetent  director.  This type of old-fashioned acting might not be so irritating if  it wasn't executed continuously on throughout the movie.  The ending is  really good for a laugh, but not meant to be.  You'll just have to watch  and see what happens.  Overall, the movie reminds me of an old-fashioned  film.  Once again, the plot was fulfilling, but the destitute acting  dampened the whole effect of the movie.  If old-fashioned and  unprofessional is your style, this movie's for you.",944784000,8,1358,4.428571428571429
334695,1,6301578848,"The movie The Turn of the Screw is definetely not one fit for the years top ten list.  With its fake scenery, bad music, and bad acting, the movie keeps getting worse, right from the start.
First of all, the scenery is  very unrealistic.  Whenever the plot forces the characters outside, it is  as if they venture into a different world.  While the inside of Blythe  House, the mansion where Jane Coverly has recently been hired to govern two  children, Miles, 14, and Flora, 7, the outdoors is incredibly fake.  The  mansion at least has accurately placed props, and its interminable  stairways and hallways may add to the feelings of fear the movie attempts  to arise in oneself.  However, when Coverly ventures outside, especially  when she goes to the parapet, the scenery appears poorly colored with  bright green grass and dull buildings.  The film is as if it is older than  it should be.
Furthermore, the music does not add to the ""fear  factor""of the movie.  Although it attempts to be eerie, the music,  which is usually in a minor key, only makes the audience laugh.  When Flora  plays the ""Death March"" on the piano, it is not frightening, in  fact, it almost is cute and amusing.
Moreover, the acting is atrocious.  Coverly, played by Lynn Redgrave, is ineffective with her display of  emotions.  When she is frightened by the children and the lurid past of  Blythe House, her expressions appear trite and almost comical.  The ending  of scenes, which often takes place with a character staring off into the  distance, is totally unrealistic and over-used.
Hence, this is definitely  a movie that is worth missing.  I would never recommend this for a scary  movie, however, as a comedy, it is not too bad!",944697600,2,1718,4.738095238095238
334696,1,6301578848,"Henry James's The Turn of the Screw is a movie that is more technically impaired than my Uncle Floyd who still uses an abacus to do his accounting. In fact, in this writer's opinion, it is the most technically impaired  movie of the century.  This movie contains sound effects that are annoying  and distracting.  The music is irrelevant to the plot and settings.  These  elements are so repulsive that you can't even concentrate on the characters  of the movie.
In a beginning scene Jane Cubberly, played by Lynn  Redgrave, arrives at Bligh the home of Flora and Miles, played by Eva  Griffis and Jasper Jacob; the children that she is to take care of and  watch over.  The music beginning this scene is not complementary to the  plot.  The music should be very easygoing and welcoming, but it is  abrupt,  as if the director was trying to rush the scene.  This should be a key  scene in which the director should be commencing his plot, so he should not  have allowed music to hurry through it.
In another scene in which Ms.  Grose, the maid/cook, and Ms. Cubberly were discussing the death of Peter  Quint an irrelevant and jarring sound effect diverted the entire dialogue  of the characters.  It made absolutely no sense to place this ""ding"" after  the maid had commented on the way people stated Quint had died.  The  audience loses their attentiveness on the point focussing only on the corny  sound effect.
There's a scene where Ms. Cubberly has decided to play a  game with the children.  Her role was to go to the clock tower and bring  Miles a doll.  When she appears in the top of the tower the classic door  slam, at which she is supposedly locked-in, takes place.  With the events  leading up to this scene the door closing was immediately anticipated.  It  was not subtle, and it also didn't even sound like a door.  This sound  effect would have been much more effective if it had been eerie but also  faint.  Producers can't throw in a murky sound effect that does not sound  like it was intended to and not expect the audience to find it  hilarious.
In conclusion, I have found The Turn of the Screw to be  technically impaired due to the cheap sound effects and unflattering music  used in many of its scenes.  The inhospitable music, the corny ""ding"", and  far-fetched door slam really brought the movie down in quality.  I know I  would much rather sit through my Aunt describing her state spoon  collection, than sit through another viewing of Henry James's The Turn of  the  Screw.",944697600,2,2504,4.592255125284738
334697,1,6301578848,"The Turn of the Screw is not a movie I would recommend renting on a Friday night.  The monotonous scenes will put you to sleep.  The same events keep reoccuring.  Jane Cubberly sees the spirits of Miss Jessel and her evil  lover, Peter Quint.  She accuses Flora of seeing Miss Jessel, but she would  always deny it.  That goes on throughout the entire movie.  You will also  be annoyed with the generic music.  Every time something bad was about to  happen, you would hear a clamor of xylophone chords.  The camera work also  seemed very juvenile.  Almost like a high-school student filmed it.  There  is a scene where Jane Cubberly is on a carriage with Luke.  They are  supposed to be moving, but it is plain to see there is a fake background  and you can hear the poorly made sounds of horses galloping.  I think this  book should never have been made into a movie.  It just seemed to ruin the  book.",944524800,2,903,4.404907975460123
334698,1,6301578848,"""The Turn of the Screw"" is a tiresome British production based on the novel by Henry James.  Directed by Dan Curtis the movie is 118 min. of poorly done British horror. Mrs. Cubberly (Lynn Redgrave) is hired, by  the looks of her teeth, to watch Flora and Miles at Bligh a manor house in  the country outside of London.  The first thing she encounters with the  children is Miles has been thrown out of school for reasons unknown.  She  thinks she can find out why and change th child before even meeting him.  The music was belittling and annoying.  The sound effects gave the same  effect.  The dings throughout the movie in the ""scary"" parts were  move distracting then anything else.  If it was meant to set a mood it did,  humor.  The camera angles made no sense.  The special effects didn't exist.  Teh ghosts of Peter Quint and Miss Jessel were too human.  They just  looked pale. The only good part of the movie was the acting of Megs Jenkins  a sMrs. Grose, she was the only one who successfully portrayed her part.

7812760,5,6301578848,"What a number of viewers of this program fail to realize is that this adaptation of the classic Henry James novel was videotaped in its entirely on location at a centuries-old estate in England. With the video format, a high degree of intimacy is realized and, as a result, the production feels very much like a stage play. The only exception is the outdoor portions of the program, which are shot on grainy 16mm film that gives a totally different visual impact.
Additionally, some reviewers fail to understand that the music score includes frequent use of eerie percussion cues, which several people on Amazon have mistakenly referred to as sound effects. The music very much adds to the moody, mysterious atmosphere.
This program was shot for ABC-TV's ""Wide World of Entertainment"" series, originally airing in 1974. It is not a British production but was shot in England. The late Lynn Regrave was a fine actress and viewers should look at this like a stage play and not expect a cinematic film experience. On that level it succeeds admirably considering the budgetary limitations. The richness of shooting in a genuine old estate - no phony studio sets here -- is another plus.",1373155200,2,1182,4.885572139303482
7812761,5,6301578848,"With superb, almost supernatural acting and the direction of Dan Curtis, this story
is brought to the not very faint-hearted to be viewed in good company on dark shadowy nights.
The movie is genuinely frightening, and the subject should - and cannot - be taken lightly.",1366502400,,269,4.869565217391305
7812762,2,6301578848,"Lynn Redgrave is Jane Cubberly, a governess who takes over the care of two children Flora and Miles at Bly House. In this quiet country estate she experiences or sees strange things. By the time she knows the truths about her predecessor Miss Jessel and one Peter Quint, she is convinced that some evil force is out there, waiting for the chance to corrupt the two ""innocent"" children in her charge.

Dan Curtis directed this made-for-TV adaptation of Henry James' famous novella in 1974. The production is obviously low-budget and some images and sound effects are technically inept - in the ""storm"" scene there is no storm; the sun is shining somewhere up above. The menacing presence of ""them"" (you know what I am talking about) are not menacing enough; they look like actors with special make-ups - but that is not really the problem of this version.

In spite of some nice visual tricks, Dan Curtis' film is not creepy or psychologically insightful enough. The ambiguity of the original book is totally gone. Look how the governess talking back to her employer, the children's uncle, calling him ""dreadful."" Her repressed sexual desire is part of her (over)eagerness to ""protect her"" children, but the film discards one of the most intriguing parts of James' story.

Instead, materials are added to the plot that should be simple, but they result in the film's most unconvincing (and sometimes boring) scenes. When young boy Miles should be a ""perfect"" and ""innocent"" child, in her eyes at least, the film describes him as cold-hearted animal torturer. Clearly the boy is not ""innocent"" in the way the governess would want him to be (neither is Flora, who can be insensitive to the dead frog), but Ms. Cubberly is too slow to understand what is so obvious to us. The film as a consequence fails to create the psychological tension that should be between the governess and the children. The two child actors are very good, but this film's Flora and Miles still do not have mysterious feeling that should keep puzzling us to the very end. Is this slow development intentional? Some scenes even has Miles talking to her as if wooing her, but does that suggest she could be attracted to Miles, not his uncle? But ... what is the point of all of this?

Some may think Lynn Redgrave, who is to be Oscar-nominated twice in the 1990s, is overacting especially in the second half, but all in all her acting (and that of other supporting actors) is acceptable, if not special. Interestingly her father Michael Redgrave played the role of ""Uncle"" in a far superior adaptation ""The Innocents."" Megs Jenkins also plays Mrs. Grose, the same role she did in ""The Innocents"" made 13 years before.

The overlong film is pointless (to me) and lacks intensity. Not bad as most recent James adaptation ""In a Dark Place,"" but still not good.

MPI's DVD includes the interviews with the director Dan Curtis and star Lynn Redgrave.",1209859200,,2913,4.78131212723658
