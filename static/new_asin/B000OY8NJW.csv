2801652,1,B000OY8NJW,Doesn't want to play on a regular DVD player. On actual disk it states that it will only play on a HD DVD player. This was unknown info when I purchased the dvd.,1186963200,4,161,3.909090909090909
2801653,5,B000OY8NJW,"Very very pretty and relaxing. Good to just chill out and relax or as a background to the party or a dinner. Just like looking out the window and with some soft classical type music playing in background.
This one has a bit of everything, and they are all good. There is also full hour version for each envinroment if you find one that you like in particular.
I dunno what the other reviewer is smoking, but i found the quality to be excellent both video and sound wise.",1185840000,26,470,4.292134831460674
2801654,5,B000OY8NJW,"This HD-DVD is great to show off your system to your friends.  It is composed of 9 regional views each about 10 minutes each.  Each view spans various very clear, almost 3D images of the region with music in the background.  No plot, no story, just restful music and scenes.

Although HD-DVD seems to only approach 90% of the resolution that I have experienced with over-the-air HD, this disc reaches the best resolution that I have experienced from the HD-DVD format.

Again, a great HD-DVD to show-off your system, or to relax to, nothing more, nothing less.",1185753600,5,560,4.731958762886598

2801656,5,B000OY8NJW,"This program makes me glad I turned my livingroom into an HD home theatre.  We can't believe how fantastic it is to be transported to what truly seem to be some of the world's most beautiful places in the comfort of our own home.  The colors, the clarity and most of all the amazing places I've never seen make this a breathtaking experience.  The natural surround-sound is over the top....  I seriously thought there were songbirds in my house when the Costa Rica and Hawaii chapters were playing.  I'm tempted to get some of the other programs in this collection.",1183248000,17,565,4.61
2801657,3,B000OY8NJW,This disc is in 1080i not p.  The music is ok. Good thing I got this for $17.,1183075200,15,77,3.2777777777777777
2801658,5,B000OY8NJW,"This is an excellent soothing and relaxing DVD.  If you are a working and commuting individual, then you need sleep and rest.  Medications are good, but Nature is the best medicine without any bad side effects or hangovers to experience afterwards.  This DVD's natural sound of birds and ocean waves and cinematography is well balanced. You can hear the ocean waves and sea birds, while calm background music is playing. It has the new loop effect, so you can put it in your TV/DVD disk drive and at the end of the series, then the Pacific coast will continue to play until you decide to stop it.  It takes your imagination (as if you were looking out of a picture window) and look into the face of nature.  So save yourself some money and skip the Airport TSA lines, baggage checks, plane tickets and relax in your favorite armchair with a cold drink and watch Mother Nature put you to sleep in the safe environment of your home.  Let the RICH keep their oil, along with its high prices.  I await the future DVDs.  Please add squirrels and sandpipers, as animals.  Thank you for sharing your relaxation ministry with the world, at such a time as this.",1182211200,22,1152,4.526570048309178

2801670,1,B000OY8NJW,"Indeed the info states that it will only play on HD DVD. thinking it would possibly play on ours, found we were foolish to order and pay for it. Tis a beautiful cover photo, we'll give it that...why couldn't it be made so more of us could actually get a workable product we purchased, really what is the point of being like it is, we would think, it be made so more could actually enjoy, rather than donating money for a useless DVD. Can't rate it, as truelly can't view it! Thankfully, another customer wrote in and explained about the now-defunct HD-DVD format. It should not be offered unless in blu ray or dvd. To rub salt into an already irritation, the 800 number on the jacket gets you a phone scam wanting money before they will even talk to you. They offered to call you back COLLECT.

There are not may HD DVD players out there or HD DVDs, and they won't play on regular dvd or Blu-ray machines. What you have here is an HD DVD which is written at the top of the case, But don't feel stupid, many people didn't know they lost the high definition war or that there were even two formats.  Chalk it up to experience, or try returning it if you haven't opened it, but if they don't play for you, you've already opened it. So like I said, chalk it up to experience, but a lesson learned.

This sends some sort of ""error message"" to the screen that I don't understand.  So---sending it back.  Such a shame.

Further inspection on the back of the product (in the fine print) said that it was only playable on one DVD-Player (HD) that was sold in 2007. I went on-line to investigate the issue and found that there was no support for that DVD-Player in HD. So, this five year old HD movie should not even be on the shelf for retail sale.

Well it got lost in the shuffle and I just now opened it and tried to view on Blu-Ray, DVD player and my PC's DVD player. It does not work on any of them. Checking the ad now I now see there is a disclaimer that it will only work on HD DVD devices. I am positive when I first purchased it did not say that and in fact it came up when I was looking up BLU-RAY discs for under $10. Shame on me for now just opening it up but shame on them for having it being deceivingly described originally. I don't expect a refund as it has been over a year and a half but if anyone with a HD DVD player wants it please contact me and they can have it just for the price of shipping.",1333584000,,783,3.869565217391304

Unfortunately, the product has not worked on any of the 5 DVD players we've tried it on.  Guessing it is a format incompatibility with a US standard.  Not sure why this should be the case as our electronics are of fairly recent vintage.  We cannot recommend a purchase under these conditions.",1326758400,,521,4.608695652173913

Figured it would cost me more to send it back than it cost.  If the cost seems too good to be true, then there is a reason for it.

In fact I recognized almost ALL of it from the other video, really very dissapointing. Add that to the burned in website you have to look at for much of the video, plus the horrible elevator music, plus it is 1080i not 1080p - I give this a hands-down. Natures Colors was also only 1080i but at least that one had good music.",1291852800,2,474,4.277777777777778

And the producer also states that you can now turn the music off.  Not on mine!

I wouldn't even have considered purchasing this blu-ray otherwise since I knew the watermark would take away for the beauty of the scenes.  Sorry, but I'm really annoyed by those things.  They're distracting.

And I'd like to listen to just the natural sounds and not the piano music.

It's a shame because without these annoying features, it would probably be an awesome disc.  But it's useless to me.  I'll probably pass it along to a thrift shop.",1290124800,,674,4.635593220338983

Soothing background music and natural background sounds of ocean waves, streams and the environment add to the immersive experience. This is not a documentary; there are no talking heads or narration, just beautiful ambient entertainment with stunning ""must see"" visuals from around the planet.

So in other words, use ""Beautiful Places"" to find what resonates with you, then if you love the Costa Rica footage you'll definately want the entire Costa Rica DVD.

2801778,5,B000OY8NJW,"Awesome DVDs. I highly recommend them.

OK, so I set up my home theater and I've been looking for great alternative Blu-Ray films. That was when I ran across Living Landscapes HD Collection. These beautiful DVDs bring the outside inside. These are the kind of films you'll want to watch over and over, even if it is just playing in the background while you're having a morning cup of coffee.

They are filmed in High Definition and the photography is excellent. My visual experience was immersive and compelling... it looked to me like I could walk into the scene.
Couple that with audio in 5.1 surround sound and the DVDs creates the sense of being there.
The first released versions do have music playing in the background. While I did enjoy the music selections, I understand that there are soon-to-be-released versions that will allow the user to pick music or no music and listen to just the natural sounds. These will definitely be added to my collection.

When I first spotted these on Amazon, what I wanted to know was ""is this going to be cheesy and a waist of money or a treasure I'll really enjoy.""
After watching my first one numerous times now, the verdict is ""treasure"".

I, like too many others, are addicted to having a tv on in my home almost all the time.  It is in the background almost but it is not.  There's always yapping and music and screaming and noise and talking and schtick and an endless barrage of brands and stuff yelling for my attention.  And you know what, it gets it. I fight it but it gets me looking and I don't even want to.  Not any more.  When I put Beautiful Places on I'm transformed.  Everyone in the household is quieter and more placid.  We lower our voices AND we actually talk to each other more.  Of course, we're not competing with the yelling heads.
Lets face it.  The tv, for most housholds, is in a place thats the center of activity.  Especially with the great new large HD sets.  We enjoy that space more now.  When the sports and the news is over DVD's like Living Landscapes goes on and everything is more peaceful.  I actually checked my blood pressure, which is normal normally while watching regular tv then again, one hour after having Living Landscapes on and reading a good book.

2801812,3,B000OY8NJW,"Much like the HDscape Sampler in HD-DVD, Living Landscapes: World's Most Beautiful Places is a preview disc of the various places this film group has been.  They have hour long versions as well if there is any particular location that you like.

After popping the disc into the Xbox 360 HD DVD Player, I was immediately surprised how much clearer the picture was compared to other discs of this nature.  The music that played with each of the nine or so locations on the disc worked well too.

My biggest gripe about this preview disc was that for a majority of the locations, they weren't terribly exciting.  I felt more variety could have been shown in each location and the preview disc just didn't impress.  The one hour long DVDs might give the kind of variety I'm looking for, but the whole point of a preview is to give the viewer an idea of what to expect.  If the preview is boring, then I'm not going to bother with the longer versions.

Another nagging issue, which may or may not bother viewers, is that a majority of the video has a watermark in the lower right corner of the screen.  Great if you are showing this off in a consumer based area, not so much in the comfort of your own home.

In the end, World's Most Beautiful Places served its purpose.  I will most likely pick up two full length HD DVDs from this series (as of writing, the HD DVD versions are only available through their official website).  If you love ambient DVDs, this is a great purchase to give you an idea of what to expect from this group.",1198540800,2,1529,4.382978723404255

I would love to have had the loops be longer. These are not long loops at all so do not plan on throwing this on for ambiance at a get together and not expect for folks to see the same things 3 or 4 times during a get together.

2801815,4,B000OY8NJW,"I think the video quality is VG-Excellent overall. Yes the music is great on some, not so great on others. My wife said the same as another person - where is the narration? If you want that there are many other discs. I find it refreshing not to have someone talking for a change. This disc is not meant to be educational or instructive!! When you go out to a great scenic place do you want constant chatter?

Based on this disc I bought the 9 disc version. I'll post under that title but, in a nutshell, its not worth paying for the longer segments as some of the locations i.e. Hawaii & Pacific Coast are not all that wonderful (I've been there) or certainly not the best those locations can offer. Also on some locations, the same boring scenes are too long, like someone pulled of the road, set up the camera, took a nap, woke up & moved on. Not much effort into finding the best places.

The music is appropriately soft and elegant, along side the background sounds of streams, wind, ocean waves.  This disc is easily on par with my other nature disc, Planet Earth, but without all that talking.  It will make a specatular ""screen saver"" in my front room, ever reminding me of the magnificent contrasts of nature's natural beauty.
