7927005,5,B00004Y7JL,"I originally bought the official DVD release of this film from Hong Kong and it was barely watchable.  More like a bad VHS transfer.  I was actually kind of shocked by how bad it looked, so I took a chance and purchased this new US edition through Warner Brothers Archive, and was very happy with this transfer.  It was a 100% improvement from the 1st DVD I bought.  I don't think I can add much on the film content.  It's like a Chinese MISSION IMPOSSIBLE,  lots of fun, although there is a serious enough undertone with the deaths of a few of the main characters and the loss the rest of their team feels.",1456963200,,607,4.280701754385965
7927006,5,B00004Y7JL,"Admittedly I bought this because I'm a huge fan of Takeshi Kaneshiro. I thought the plot was good, the cast is great, & the film is awesome.",1383264000,,140,4.222222222222222
7927007,4,B00004Y7JL,Loved this movie when I saw it at a film festival in Santa Fe back in '97.  I've been looking for it ever since.  Finally found it and bought it as a Christmas present for my brother.  He liked it too!,1231718400,,201,3.8536585365853657
7927008,4,B00004Y7JL,I just watched this movie for the 4th time and enjoyed it the 4th time as much as the 1st.  It has the same improbable plot and circumstances as Mission Impossible but with great HK action sequences.  Takeshi Kaneshiro is one of my favorite actors and he doesn't disappoint!  You won't regret it taking the time to see this one.,1138492800,,328,4.433333333333334
7927009,4,B00004Y7JL,"A hip, modern Hong Kong flick inspired by Mission:Impossible (and more fun), that manages to be big, flashy, and entertaining.  Fast-paced action, excellent editing, cool stunts, and energetic direction make it feel like a slick, animated Japanese cartoon. Particularly noteable is Jordan Chan in the film, who does much of the movie's cool fights, dodging, and running. Takeshi Kaneshiro, however, doesn't do much here, other than look pretty for the female audience.  Needless to say, at around 90 minutes, you won't get a whole lot of character development, but there's plenty intriquite action,  nice European locations, twists with plenty plot-holes (yet ""cool"" nevertheless).  If you're looking for substance in your film, you won't find it here, but you will get a ""fun,"" entertaining, spy flick with speedy Hong Kong action, at least more entertaining than a James Bond flick (although it makes just about as much sense).  Not bad if you want to be entertained for 90 minutes.  As for the DVD: The DVD I got didn't have any extras, which was a shame. The english subtitles were part of the image.",989366400,4,1104,5.038461538461538
