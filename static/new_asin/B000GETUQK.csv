8131128,5,B000GETUQK,"John Brown clearly explains the process of building an articulating* armature for use in the making of a clay sculpture. You are walked through the entire process of building an wireframe armature from start to finish. Only the making of the armature is shown. No other steps in the making of a clay sculpture are seen. The images are well framed: you can clearly see what he is doing. The audio track is excellent. It's important for the student to have the teacher's words in sink with the what is being show. Some instructors forget this. John Brown keeps it together and tells a good story. He is an excellent instructor. This is one of the best instructional videos I have had the good fortune to run across. I am happy I bought it. John Brown has come out with 8 other instructional videos. I will be buying those as well. *Note: ""Articulating"" means an armature with removable sections. This makes it easier to take the sculpture apart and work on individual parts separately.  Once you learn this technique you will always rely on it for your own work. Regards, J.V.",1338595200,2,1074,4.62303664921466
8131129,4,B000GETUQK,"Its pretty good, and the DVD is something you can go back to again and again to perfect your own armatures.

For some reason, this DVD only seems to play on my computer, and not in a normal DVD or Bluray player ( I tried both).

Other than that, its worth watching.",1310860800,,265,4.076923076923077
8131130,4,B000GETUQK,"I liked this video and was pretty happy with the instructions within. I liked how he designed the arms and legs with standard wire. If you are going to do character maquettes then you cant go wrong with this video.

Reason for the -1 star is that the video is almost entirely for character models and those that are not over 2 foot tall. If that is what you are going to do, for say 3d digitization then you will be fine.

If however, you are going to do large sculptures anything life sized, the techniques in this will probably not work out too well for you.

Thanks for reading my review.",1274918400,3,591,4.258928571428571
8131131,5,B000GETUQK,I purchased this DVD as a means of preparing/instructing myself in the art of sculpting prior to teaching this in my own junior high Art classroom.  After viewing this DVD I then played it it in my classroom because it was so informative and educational.  It is an exceptional DVD and I encourage beginners or expert sculptors to get their own copy because its information is guaranteed to make you a better sculptor.,1198713600,8,417,4.698630136986301
