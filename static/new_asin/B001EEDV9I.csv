8297956,5,B001EEDV9I,Saw this on the internet and was very impressed.  Found this DVD and ordered it right away.  Wonderful documentary.,1480204800,,115,5.0
8297957,5,B001EEDV9I,"I saw this video twice on cable and every time I said to myself this is the best and most intriguing explanation and clarification of the Big Bang theory and its origins I have ever seen or heard about.  It seems that the more we learn about the universe the more the presumptions and facts surrounding the theory of the Big Bang become less theory and more fact.  And of course, there is a general tendency to call what has already been proven to be true a ""theory"" none the less.  And because scientific theories can be flexible it's possible that in in the near futures we will have to revise our concepts of The Big Bang.  But until that time if you are in the least curious about the Big Bang and what's really behind it both theoretically and practically speaking based on what we do know at this point in time then this video will bring to life the story,  personalities, and events that made it possible.  In my opinion this is a spectacular accomplishment that brings to the ordinary person the facts about such a complex topic. The documentary presents the personalities, events, and history and background that involves both religious belief and scientific facts in both an engaging and completely understandable way.  You will come away from this video truly having learned about one of the most important discoveries in cosmology, and not only that, you will understand it and have enjoyed the journey.  This is a totally approachable and immensely educational and enjoyable documentary video that you must not pass up.",1459468800,2,1532,4.7330827067669174

8297959,5,B001EEDV9I,This documentary leads to a better understanding of the universe and the history of how it gradually became understood by scientists of the past. Highly recommended.,1438732800,,165,5.384615384615385
8297960,5,B001EEDV9I,This is one of the best of the worm hole series. Chock ful of interesting ways to deal with difficult  to understand (and believe) concepts. Helps in a scientific and religious way to separate two very different ways of explaining who we are and where we came from. Love it!!,1390348800,,275,4.5
8297961,5,B001EEDV9I,Beyond the Big Bang is a good resource for teaching the progression of science in a nut shell as well as how we ended up with the theory of the Big Bang and facts that support the theory.  It is also a well done video for the general public.,1347926400,2,241,3.9183673469387754
8297962,5,B001EEDV9I,"This video describes the history of cosmology, and how we've pieced together scientific knowledge to support the big bang theory.  It is very well-written in a style that makes it ""mind-blowing"".  It is a perfect combination of history, astronomy, science, interviews, animation, humanity, knowledge, and, information.",1260057600,5,318,5.891304347826087
