2203938,2,B000784WKO,"I had watched this series when it first aired, back in the 80's. Unfortunately, it did not hold up. Four excellent actors, but the writing was weak and the laughs few and far between",1490227200,,182,4.382352941176471

2203940,5,B000784WKO,"Another priceless comedy from the Brits - thanks, guys; we can't seem to do them here!

The self-sufficient neighbors drive the ""normal"" neighbors next door crazy, with lots of laughs along the way.

The cast is outstanding, and the writing quite clever; you won't catch yourself looking at your watch while you are watching these!",1485561600,,331,5.0

2203944,5,B000784WKO,"This 1975 to 1978 British Sitcom is always worth a laugh, especially if you like British humour.  A simple premise between two couples living next door to each other, one that is trying to keep up appearances and the other which is trying to be self sufficent and be closer to nature.  The couples lives and their interaction provides the humourous moments.  Added benefit is Felicity Kendal playing Barbara Good, who I find talented and adorable.",1483574400,,447,4.855263157894737
2203945,5,B000784WKO,"I was quite excited to see that I could get most of one of my favorite British TV show in one reasonably priced boxed set.  And equally disappointed that the rights to the last season belong to someone else who will charge more for that one season than this entire set.
The DVD quality was good.  No glitches or bad spots.  The plastic in the case was somewhat brittle, so I shall have to get another storage case for it.  But if you love British comedies, any of the stars of this series (all of whom have helmed shows of their own at one time or another), or even if you have never seen one, this series is a delightful start.  I cannot recommend it enough.",1483488000,,659,4.198412698412699
2203946,4,B000784WKO,"I was 18 in 1975, and became a fan of PBS where I saw this program when it aired in New York when I lived in Brooklyn.  This show was hilarious at the time, and over the years, I have looked for it to be aired again or to find the episodes, which I now have.  Now, at almost 60, I find it just as charming and funny now, as I did then.

If you can find all four seasons, purchase them as they are worth it.  Wonderful show, and how quickly the years have gone by.

Why did I give this series 4 stars instead of 5?  Because it doesn't include the 4th season.  But what the heke, it really does deserve 5 stars!",1483056000,,609,3.824

2203961,5,B000784WKO,"Superb British comedy. Even the Queen shakes in her shorts with this series!  She, too, loved it. I remember seeing it when I lived in the country of Norway and loved seeing it on their NRK or was it TV2 station.

The comedic series revolves around a city business man gone self reliant and his wife who decide to start their own off grid living with chickens, pigs, goats  and home grown vegetables. Their next door neighbors must put up with the antics of the animals and the quirky behaviour of Tom who runs the farm in the city. His cute wife makes the mark with her down home acceptance of the sometimes outlandish ploys of her newly converted farmer husband . Of all the British or even American comedies I would rate this the very best. It is cute, reminiscent of the good ""old"" times of 1975-78... when every thing was sane, normal and wars were only a memory of the past. I miss those days... and this comedy takes me back. The DVDs arrived in excellent condition and the videos have excellent color saturation and sharp images and excellent sound qualities  I am in Dreamsville with these DVDs.",1462060800,,1104,4.505

2203963,5,B000784WKO,"This was reviewed before I think...loved this series when it appeared on PBS some years ago...Loved getting the set and enjoyed watching over.
Seems to me there were more episodes...I remember watching an episode where Barbara made a suit for Tom out of some light green dyed wool material that Tom wove...I'll have to search for that.",1458777600,,335,4.894736842105263
2203964,5,B000784WKO,"Having never seen nor heard of this T.V. series I absolutely love this series. ITS A 10. I must admit the first 2 episodes were a little slow in regards to keeping my interest but after that it really moves along. You get to really enjoy each of the character's, especially between Tom and his wife, they play off each others sense of humor and you can understand the talking of all the character's. The plots are well written and interesting and you wonder from one episode to the next how are they going to survive this, so you always want to see the next episode for the results. It took me awhile to get used to Margo the stuff-shirt, prim proper neighbor but after a while she grow on you too and softens her attitude. This is a very enjoyable, entertaining, funny, lighthearted series something you could watch over and over. Even the supporting casts are good that you see from time to time. I RECOMMEND THIS ""GOOD NEIGHBORS""  highly.",1458518400,,941,4.502923976608187

It upsets me greatly that Amazon Prime has now removed this show, and all other of my fav BBC series I have watched in PRIME over the past few years, from the PRIME offering! Appears to be just another sign of the greediness of Amazon to review ""what you like"" and then snatch it away to try to make you pay.

2204103,2,B000784WKO,"This is now terribly old, having aired in the 70s. Yet, the theme is still appealing, living ""off the grid."" I find nothing funny in it, but I want charming, at least, and trying hard to find even that. I wanted more animals on screen, and I got hopeful when a little black cat appeared in the house, but she was quickly shunted outside to ""work,"" which appears to fit in consistently with the drudge attitude that prevails here. Yes, that part is realistic; if you are going to live off the land, you can't start out being too fond of your chickens,pigs or cats! I find no chemistry between Tom and Barbara. She's so whiney, and he's so pooped. When you hear he is just 40 and tired of working for the company,you have to wonder how he will succeed in subsistence farming with such low drive. I guess I am holding this show to too much scrutiny. I think it works best for me as a soporific, as I often doze off about 10 minutes into it. It's benign, at least.",1420243200,,960,4.251366120218579

2204108,5,B000784WKO,"This is one of my most-favorite TV series of all times. I watched it first on Dutch TV - w/Dutch subtitles - in the 1970's when I was in high school while living along the German side of the border. The actors are perfect, taking their characters just to the edge w/o spilling over. Always funny, this series is about a couple who decide to throw off all modern pretenses, snobbery, & job...& live off the land. Their land. The issue is that their land is their London suburb home. The neighbors (especially the wife, wonderfully played by Penelope Keith from ""To The Manor Born"") are of a completely different frame of mind, & ""hilarity ensues""; it really does. In this second season, the show reaches its stride. Because it is so well written, you do not need to watch Season 1 to appreciate the show, but as with all good stories, it will add to your enjoyment.",1419811200,,864,4.474683544303797

Watch as the Goods drop out and go back to the land in the suburbs of London, while their neighbors, the Leadbetters, interact with them at the top level of English comedy. Penelope Keith the great English classical actress plays Margo Leadbetter with such natural snobbery and witticisms at the expense of everyone, you'd think she was born for this part. Paul Eddington as her husband Jerry is a great foil for Margo, and the other two - Richard Briers and Felicity Kendel round out the star strewn cast.

It ties into the frustration with modern life so many feel, and the left over hippy sensations fro m the 1960s.  Rather than running awy to a commune, they create one right in the London suburbs.  They make a go of doing it yourself. They tell the system to bug off.  They throw social norms to the winds.  And they make it.  There is hope.",1418688000,,451,4.186046511627907

With his wife's support, they decide to become self-sufficient much to the shock and disdain of their snobbish neighbors Margo and Jerry who happen to be their closest friends.

2204275,5,B000784WKO,"Not to be confused with the reality show, The Good Life (aka Good Neighbours) tells the story of Tom and Barbara, the Goods, who have decided on becoming self-sufficient, much to their neighbours, Jerry and Margo's chagrin.  In this season, Tom and Barbara continue attempting to be self-sufficient, by attempting to sell their harvest surplus. Dealing with two students whom they think WTom is their new messiah for giving up the rat race. Getting brief fame for being published in a magazine, dealing with a leek thief, taking a chance to move away from Surbiton, and tending night classes to learn about pottery and such.

What makes the show timeless is watching how the Goods cope with being self-sufficient, while Jerry and Margo deal with the problems of modern life as well.  Not to mention having their worlds collide with hilarious results.  This happens to be one of the BBC Classic Comedies, along with Are You Being Served? and is definitely worth a view.",1408838400,,968,4.884146341463414

It has some good moments, but overall is so silly that it is difficult to watch at times.  I realize it was filmed in the 70's, but I have other shows from that time period that I still love.  This feels dated and the acting is not nearly as good as say ""As Time Goes By"", nor is the writing anywhere on par with shows like that.

Now we can't wait to cuddle up together on the couch for an episode, or two!, before bed. The subject matter is right up our alley but what I love most is the excellently witty and cerebral script that keeps my brain clipping along at a satisfying pace.

These same stars appear more than a few times on later series. The scripts are, well, just plain funny. The Goods experiment with ""self-sufficiency"" ever creating conflict with the more predictable community around them. And, this version is so much clearer visually than the ones I saw on my local PBS outlet years ago. The available closed captioning also helps. Whenever possible, I watch/listen to British programs with captions on, lest I miss some subtle nuance of dialogue that my southern U.S ears might otherwise miss.

2204376,5,B000784WKO,I have finished all 4seasons of The Good Neighbors and loved them all. The cast of actors were superb and fit together perfectly.  Each of them were great actors in their own right but together the sparks really flew. The writing and story lines were just as clever as they were funny and heartwarming at the same time. I loved the finale of the series! Perfect ending!,1393891200,,369,4.507462686567164

Now, forty years later, we are watching it again. We're living in a different place with only an acre and a half but putting every inch to use. It is still so much fun and quite inspirational, with some of the greatest stars of the ""Brit Com"" genre.  Highly recommended!",1393718400,,428,4.095238095238095

The only problem is that now I have to loan the collection to my adult daughter because she grew up watching the show with me. Thank you for stocking this hard-to-find item.,1392163200,,328,4.174603174603175

We watched it faithfully when it was first on television, and now we pull it out about every five years and watch the whole series again. It's always entertaining, and very welcome when compared to so much of what's current today. Penelope Keith is particularly good, as always.",1391731200,,359,4.714285714285714
2204396,5,B000784WKO,"From the time I first stumbled across this series I have been in love with it. It is classic British wit portrayed by a fantastic ensemble company. Unlike a lot of today's television shows this has and will endure the test of time.

Those of us who grew up in the 1960's and 1970's may well remember (or know) people who chucked it all in order to live a more simple life and, given the state of today's world, maybe they were right!

I originally watched this on Amazon Prime and then eventually purchased the entire series on DVD. The other evening a friend of mine's 9 year old child was here and wanted to see a movie. Going through the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows I came across this and it was a no-brainer for me to choose this since we were already there. Everyone enjoyed it but the test of time was proven when the 9 year old was seen laughing and really enjoying it despite some of the language being ""difficult to understand."" (British accent vs. American accent.)

I'd would strongly suggest viewing a couple of episodes from Season 1 and then, if you like it, purchasing the series as it is one that you will watch again and again.",1391558400,,1149,4.359813084112149
2204397,5,B000784WKO,"The Briers-Kendal pairing was one for the ages-- as was the Eddington-Keith one.

Their interaction was true to form; in character, not contrived to fit the plot or changing to fit the situation.  One feels as if one is watching four actual people with their distinct personalities.

The humor is light, the plots and exchanges fun.  Americans won't always get the occasional name drop of a British personality as part of a gag, but that doesn't matter.  It doesn't happen that often and is a minor, minor elements of a strong show.

If you enjoy any of the BBC comedy fare along the lines of As Time Goes By, Are You Being Served, and Keeping Up Appearances, you'll enjoy this one.  In spirit and execution, it's much closer to As Time Goes By, less slapstick than the other two, but delightful as they are.",1391299200,,808,4.569444444444445

It's a good show if you don't thik too much about it.  The best character on the show however, is their neighbor, Margo.  Think of a younger saucier Hyacinth Bucket  (pronounced boo kay).  It's her disbelief that her beloved avenue in Serbinton is home to a homestead with pigs and chickens, that drive most of the comedy in this show, and it works.

This is a fantasy about what could have happened in the mid-to-late 70-'s, but it is wonderful if you follow their line at any time.  It is a very happy and loving - so sorry if this is trivial to others reading this - idea of two people taking care of each other and their land and animals.  You won't appreciate it if you are vegetarian or vegan, but you should -  this is what meat-eaters should abide by: ""Respect and Love.""  ""McDonald's, et al., Go Away!!!""

I, myself, cannot eat meat as a citizen, so I have to move on; but, I want those who do kill their own meat to do so with reSPECT... this video is very viewable for non-meat eaters, as you can skip the few clips that discuss such.

Very sweet and easy to follow.",1390262400,,843,4.264150943396227

Somewhat dry humor mixed with situational comedy - the key to enjoying this series is to make the effort to understand what is being said - not always an easy task due to the higher prevalence of colloquialisms found in the 1970s in suburban London!",1378771200,,586,4.571428571428571

2204509,5,B000784WKO,"I've enjoyed watching this great British sit-com since it firstaired on BBC America / PBS back in the early 1990's, and then they never played the entire four seasons.  For light-hearted entertainment about a young married couple set on self-sufficiency and all its highs and lows, with no violence (except for the slaying of occasional pig or chicken -- but even that was out of sight -- and only for survival of the Good's.  Except for the clothing, the program never ages.  It is fun to watch how the Good's lifestyle ""rubs off"" on their next door neighbors, who still try to maintain their roles in the rat race and class consciousness.

Unfortunately after watching the entire four seasons, I was disappointed that the last show did not include the visit of Queen Elizabeth to the set, which was included in the television broadcst.

Reading up on the actors in the program, I just learned of the recent passing of Mr. Richard Briers.  His passing marks the last of one of the great British actors with a career of stage and screen.

I like that, while the four main characters are all good people, they are not cloyingly so. They each have their vanities and their faults. Margo Ledbetter is often used as the comic relief and it is seamless. I usually have the one complaint about most shows and movies. Why did they have to go JarJar Binx?

2204520,5,B000784WKO,"I first must admit that Good Neighbors (known as The Good Life in England) is hands-down my favorite Britcom ever.  I have watched these episodes again and again and never grow tired of them.

Meet Tom.  Tom is tired of working for a company that needs him to design stuff like plastic toys for breakfast cereals.  Ah ha!  Tom gets wild idea of chucking it all in and going back to nature by turning his suburban home into a self-sufficient farm, animals and garden and woodstove and all.  Meet his wife, the long-suffering, ever-delightful Barbara.  Watch out for her flashing temper and wicked sense of humor as she learns to muck out pig styes, attempts to create their own clothing, and bemoans the ruin of her one remaining good frock.

Meet Jerry and Margo, their next door neighbors.  Jerry still works as an executive in the corporate rat-race Tom leaves behind.  He's aided in this by well-meaning but sometimes more snooty than her own good Margo, who fancies herself not just the wife of an up-and-coming exec, but as the center of the social whirlwind.  Jerry would rather just put his feet up and have a drink.  Margo can't bear the thought of pigs living next door or her Christmas in a Van not being delivered on time--what is England coming to, after all?

This show has wonderful dialogue, great characters that you will never forget, bits that will make you fall down laughing and bits that will make you cry.  There is great interplay between these two married couples, plus hints here and there of shared attraction...but handled in the best (and funniest) of taste.  Best episode ever, IMHO, IS the Christmas one...stay clear of the peapod unless you want to get momumentally tipsy!

I even have them on VHS (taped from live broadcast). I wish there were twice as many of these episodes to watch, but that's not how English TV works (short, high-quality programs are the norm versus long runs of ever-decreasing quality). The picture quality on Amazon is acceptable (the DVD is much better). Oh, and so far, not all the seasons are available on Amazon. There are four plus a couple of specials including a command performance for the Queen. Although this series is now almost 40 years old, it wears very well as the basic premise is interesting, the writing and production values are good, and most importantly the acting is excellent.

2204576,5,B000784WKO,"Although this series is filmed and set in the 70s, I found it to be very timely.  The idea of living sustainable living has gained lots of press in recent years and this series focused on a couple trying to live a sustainable lifestyle in the suburbs.  The Goods have decided to leave the rat race behind and live a simple, self-contained life.

2204583,3,B000784WKO,"Typically British, there isn't a lot of action here, but the characters are given good humor. If you give them time to grow on you, and can in the least identify with the ""homesteading"" ethic of a 1960's generation contrasted with ""elitist"" snobbery, there's some chance you can enjoy some of these episodes. The primary couple are a hoot. ~ww",1361145600,,343,4.733333333333333

2204586,5,B000784WKO,"Many classic TV comedies - both British and American - are not as enjoyable today as they were in the past. I think it has a lot to do with pace: we are so acclimated to such fast-paced dialogue and narratives in today's TV that a 70's show seems glacial in comparison.

This series, however, ages quite well. It could be released today and succeed (in the UK or on PBS). Not that its pace in general is greatly different but the dialogue certainly is: with four of the best comic actors you could share a half-hour with (Penelope Keith as Margo and Paul Eddington as her suffering husband, Richard Briers and the adorable Felicity Kendal as their self-sufficient neighbors), the dialogue is brilliantly funny - Seinfeldesque really. And Margo Ledbetter is one of the best characters in UK TV history, right up there with Basil Fawlty and Mr. Humphries.

A very funny and pleasant sitcom. A true classic.",1360713600,,904,4.679245283018868

2204588,5,B000784WKO,"Sharply written, well acted and sweet premise.  What more to ask for in tv. Like many British sit coms more dependent on dialog than situation. This is one of the reason they hold up so well to repeated viewings. Few instances where if just one person told the truth the entire episode would evaporate in  the series.

I watched it the first time around and fell in love with it so I just purchased the DVD set and watched it again TWICE in immediate succession. It's as fresh as ever. This is the laugh out loud story of a middle class couple in a London suburb who decide to go self sufficient.
Their neighbours are equally funny as they struggle to understand the appeal of vegies in the front yard and livestock in the back.
Penelope Keith steals the show most of the time as the snooty neighbour wife who is desperately trying to hold her position in society while staying friends with these nutty grow-your-owners mucking up the street. It only gets funnier as the seasons progress.",1355961600,,729,4.53030303030303

The best shows are those where Margo and Jerry get a good go. I wonder how these 4 actors would go with something like Hotel Le Big Knob, we will never know.

When the writers felt they had run out of material dealing with that they brought the series to a close (much too soon for me,  however). The wonderful playfulness of Tom and Barbara contrasted with the proper, stiff attitude of Jerry and Margot make for great entertainment.

The next episode was so glitchy with pixelation and pausing constantly and freezing that it was quite literally un-watchable.  The third episode started the same way, with glitches - so I turned it off and returned both DVD sets back to Amazon since season 4 would be useless without seasons 1-3.  I have found in the past that usually if a series is glitchy and you get a second one to replace it right away, the next set is usually also glitchy.  I think it has to do with the fact that so many discs are produced at one time that they would all be defective from that production run.",1333324800,,713,4.291044776119403

I was so happy to see that Amazon had it available for purchase at such a great price! You have to admire the spunk of Tom and Barbara as they try to survive in a world of self-sufficiency. Through good times and bad their love for each prevails, and it almost makes me jealous! I love how they are able to over look all of the parties they miss, the loss of their telephone and television, and not to mention money!

2204619,3,B000784WKO,"I bought the set based on reviews claiming the series is on par with ""Fawlty Towers"" and the ""Yes Minister"" series. Another reviewer compared it to ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Good Neighbors was described as a 1970s show about an upper-middle-class couple, Tom and Barbara, leaving the rat race to become self-sufficient farmers. Since I lived through the 70s ""revolution"" I envisioned great potential for comedy.
Alas, none of the above is accurate.
The rat race Tom was leaving was a well paying, low pressure, comfortable job as a designer, to convert his London suburb house into a farm with a noisy tractor, pigs, a goat and even a horse, to which the neighborhood, and the government did not seem to object. On one hand the show aims to express the 70s ideology of back to nature, self-sufficiency, etc., on the other the couple still enjoys the trappings of upper-middle-class life, like a fancy restaurant and jewelry. Tom even has no problem taking illegal size fish, or shooting rabbits with a shotgun on a public golfcourse. Barbara takes the hard work and impoverished life with a somewhat fake perkiness and glee.
Their neighbors, played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington, are much more fun to watch. Without them the show would be quite flat.
It is interesting that the show was a favorite of the Queen of England.
I could overlook the improbable and contrived situations if the show was funnier. Good Neighbors is not on par with comedy masterpieces like Fawlty Towers and Yes Minister/Yes Prime Minister, nor with Everybody Loves Raymond.

This quirky eccentricity is juxtaposed with the conservative neighbors.

When he presents the facts to his wife Barbara, she agrees with him and they decide to chuck normal living and practice self-sufficiency on their suburban lot, to the eternal puzzlement of their next-door neighbors and best friends the Ledbetters. Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal are a joy to watch as the Goods--you would think they were actually a couple. Paul Eddington and Penelope Keith also shine as Jerry and Margo Leadbetter, a plastics executive and his social climbing wife, respectively. They could have been such cariactures and are not. The first season is the funniest, but all four seasons (you must buy another DVD set to get the fourth season) are fabulous and the Christmas special is probably one of the best Christmas specials I have ever seen. I have been watching this series over for over 20 years and never tire of it.

Incidentally, it is called GOOD NEIGHBORS here in the States because there was another series, which no one even remembers, called THE GOOD LIFE in the early 70s (starred Larry Hagman and Donna Mills). Evidently American importers thought we were so stupid that we couldn't tell a British series with the same title from a really rotten American series. Duh.",1160956800,,1353,4.857142857142857
2204639,5,B000784WKO,"Viewing this delightful comedy more than three decades after its production, I detected immediately one aspect of its allure that would be unique indeed in the western world today: Not the unusual plot, nor the charming yet well-developed characters---but the fact that, as different as they and their lifestyles were, Tom and Barbara and Gerry and Margo remained not only friends, but close friends.

It speaks volumes, perhaps unintentionally, that they learnt from each other, even as they argued and fought (literally) over the fence. Today's producers would see this as sappy or unrealistic, and give us the humor without the heart: The Good's and the Ledbetter's would be friends at the beginning, but then be moving away and/or divorcing by the end of the series (or perhaps trying a bit of wife-swapping).

Thankfully, these very diverse personalities were drawn together not by similarities in their tastes and values, but by location and circumstance, and grew to value each other as a result. In a society where we don't even know the names of those who live next-door, we could all benefit by trying to follow the unconscious example of these Good Neighbors!",1156204800,,1170,5.05699481865285

2204645,5,B000784WKO,"As previous reviewers have already demonstrated, this is a beloved Britcom. Blessed with a uniformly superb cast & exceptionally sharp writing, these episodes are thoroughly rewatchable; and if I have any complaint, it's only that there aren't more of them. But perhaps that's just as well: better to have a few A+ episodes than too many sub-par ones.

The ideal of self-sufficiency ... haven't we all considered it at some point or another, if only for a fleeting moment? Getting out of the rat race, making a life that's far more meaningful? OK, few of us will ever actually manage that! But we can certainly enjoy this comedic depiction of such an attempt. It does make clear just how hard a life it would be, even within the cozy confines of a TV sitcom!

And the characters themselves! I especially like that the writers didn't settle for one-dimensional cutouts. Tom Good can be a bit pushy & irritating at times, but he'd need such qualities to make the leap from vague wish to grimy reality in the first place. And his deep love for wife Barbara is plain to see, as is hers for her determined husband. Of course, Barbara herself may look like a lovely waif, but she's got plenty of backbone & fire -- Tom doesn't push her around!

Neighbors Jerry & Margot could easily have been flat characters, existing as negative foils for the Goods; instead, we get two real people, generally happy with their own way of life, genuinely puzzled by Tom & Barbara's rejection of that life -- but ultimately supportive of their friends. Margot is a special delight: not the mere snob she first appears, she's honest, loyal, and a force to be reckoned with. Despite their squabbling, it's clear that she & Jerry do love one another, and treasure their eccentric best friends.

So treat yourself to many evenings of viewing pleasure with this fine collection! The elusive fourth season will be released shortly, and then the series will be complete. You'll return to it again & again -- most highly recommended!",1141948800,,2002,4.7277936962750715

2204649,5,B000784WKO,"This is one of the greatest not only of British, but of American TV shows as well. Such a great group of actors and some of the greatest acting and writing as well. I fell in love with this show when it ran on PBS in the late 1970's as ""The Good Neighbors"", and since the early 1980's it hasn't been shown on tv at all. Many times while watching I laughed so hard that I hurt myself. It's very rare to find a show that makes you laugh and at the same time makes you feel good. It has very funny moments but also some very touching moments as well. Richard Briers, Felicity Kendal, Penelope Keith, and Paul Eddington are some of the most professional actors around and they were perfectly cast in this show. And what a great premise for a show. Briers plays Tom Good, a middle class suburban draftsman who at 40 is sick and tired of the rat race and wants something fulfulling in his life. Most people can agree with that. Thats one reason that his character is so loved. He decides to become self sufficient. Kendal is his loving wife who goes along with his dream. She is 100 percent supportive of him. Briers decides to get rid of most material things. No electricity(he builds his own generator for light), no phone, tv, stove to cook (he finds an old wood burning one), etc. He turns to farming and in no time rips up his back lawn, and starts to grow vegetables on it. He trades in his car for a cultivator. He wants to live off the land. It is very hard work but Tom and Barbara(his wife) feel it will be fulfulling. Keith and Eddington play Margot and Jerry Ledbetter, his next door neighbors. Jerry worked with Tom, and was stunned to learn of Toms new undertaking. Jerry is quite similar to Tom. Middle class and easy going and is willing to help Tom if he needs it. At times you almost feel that Jerry would want to give up his chaise lounge chair, and his daily cocktails to join up with Tom. Margot,on the other hand, is the primadonna of the snobs. She can't stand what Tom and Barbara are doing, bringing in pigs, goats, and chickens which Tom and Barbara are raising right next door to her garden which she loves and cherishes. She is constantly trying to make Tom feel guilty for dragging ""Poor Barbara"" into all of this. She is always ordering henpecked husband Jerry into answering the door or phone, or lighting her cigarette or any of her other little whims. They all perform brilliantly. This Dvd set contains the first 3 seasons (7 shows each) from 1975-1977, along with a 1977 Christmas episode. A fourth season was done in 1977-78, but those episodes are not included here. They were included on a earlier Dvd set that is now out of print. Hopefully BBC video (or Acorn video which originally issued the Dvd) will rerelease it so all four seasons will be available. The very last episode was filmed as a Royal Command Performance and this is also available with the final 7 episodes on the same Dvd. The Queen of England was a huge fan of this show and it was performed especially for her. The quality of Series 1-3 is very good considering the 30 years ago of filming or videotaping. The Dvd also contains interviews of cast, and crew, and fans of the show. In closing I'm so happy that the first 3 seasons of the show are now available, and hopefully the last season will be reissued soon so I have the complete collection. This is a must 4 dvd set for anyone interested in good, clean comedy that they just don't make anymore. It's British and sometimes the dialogue can be a little hard to understand, but with listening a little more closely and with repeated viewings, this show will grow on you in a very short time.",1136592000,,3647,4.388478581979321

The situation is hillarious.  The neighbors, the Leadbetters, are a stitch because they take take their sophistication and position in society so seriously (Margo is a little bit of a Hyacinth Bucket).  Barbara Good is so cute you just can't help loving her.  Tom Good is a nutcase, but his determination to live an alternative lifestyle fuels the humor of the show.  The cast members are all very distinguished British actors; Richard Briars, Penelope Keith, Paul Eddington, and Felicity Kendal are all well known from other very popular British shows.  This series is a classic you'll watch over and over again.  I've been watching episodes for the last 20 years and have never tired of them.

2204656,5,B000784WKO,"LET ME START BY SAYING THAT THE WHOLE SERIES IS TERRIFIC. IT'S A VERY FUNNY, AT TIMES STODGY, BUT ALWAYS WARM COMEDY WHICH TOUCHES ON THEME'S WHICH EVERY WORKING HUMAN BEING HAS GONE THROUGH EXCEPT PARENTING. NEITHER COUPLE HERE HAS CHILDREN AND THEY ARE NEVER MUCH IN THE PICTURE. THE ACTING IS BRILLIANT AND SHOULD BE APPLAUDED. WHILE I HAVE READ REVIEWS BY OTHERS WHICH CORRECTLY POINT THIS OUT, THEY TEND TO SINGLE OUT PENELOPE KEITH. SHE'S GOOD, BUT IT'S THE HEN BITTEN BUT NOT BEATEN EXECUTIVE JERRY, PLAYED BY PAUL EDINGTON WHO SHINES THE MOST. HE LATER WENT ON TO PLAY THE MINISTER AND PRIME MINISTER OF THE 2 SERIES OF THE SAME NAME. CHECK THOSE OUT!

I READ MR. COWAN'S REVIEW IN WHICH HE POINTS OUT THAT THE RUNNING TIME DOESN'T MATCH THE NUMBER OF EPISODES. I HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF EPISODES BUT CAN'T FIGURE OUT AT ALL IF THIS DVD SET WILL INCLUDE EVERY EPISODE OR NOT. I REALIZE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER SET OUT THERE WHICH WILL CONTAIN THE FINAL EPISODES PLUST THE ROTAL COMMAND PERFORMANCE.

I AM CERTAIN THAT MY COLLECTION (ALL VHS) IS MISSING AT LEAST 2 EPISODES AND THERE MAY BE MORE. ANY IDEAS ON HOW TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS?",1121126400,,1147,4.431279620853081
2204657,5,B000784WKO,"I won't comment on the great material, but just want to add that this set contains all but the last season, which is available separately.

I was impressed with the quality of the video and audio on the DVD set.  It was a much clearer picture than my VHS tapes.

The DVD menu does not allow selection of the Closed Captioning, however if your TV or DVD player supports it separately, then it's available via the TV or player.

If you enjoyed this series as much as I did, your only disappointment with this DVD set will be the fact that the last series (season 4) is not included.

Basically, I agree with the excellent review posted by J.M.Ambrosio.",1119571200,,650,4.428571428571429
2204658,5,B000784WKO,"I've had the new DVD set for about ten days now (my local retailer had it out on the shelves a week before the official release date, I grabbed it the moment I spotted it), so I guess I will be the first to give the rundown on the set.

This is a high-quality release from BBC Video, on par with the ""Fawlty Towers"" and ""Yes, Minister"" sets. There are four single-sided discs in an attractive, colorful fold-out case -- one series (or season) per disc, plus a fourth for the 1977 Christmas special plus a few extras. I have watched about half the episodes and they are bright and clear, no problems with picture or sound quality. One odd thing: although the package is labeled ""Good Neighbors"", the titles on the episodes themselves say ""The Good Life"", the original name of the series (the music and graphics are the same).

The set is light on special features, the main feature being an interview with ""cast, crew, and celebrity fans"" that runs about a half hour. It is basically a highlight reel from the series, with running commentary from Richard Briers, Penelope Keith, and some other British television personalities who will probably only be familiar to residents of the UK. Nothing too profound here, just a lot of people going on about how wonderful the show was, sort of like a long promo (but still fun to watch). The only disappointment is that Felicity Kendal does not make an appearance.

Still, the most important thing is that all the episodes from series 1-3 are included, in their original broadcast order. Another reviewer mentioned that the series finale is ""missing"" from the set, and that is true -- none of the episodes from the fourth and final series are included, presumably because they were previously released as part of a DVD set from Acorn Media. Apart from that one flaw, this is a terrific set, and a must-have.

As for the show itself, what can I say? This is without doubt the sweetest television program ever made. And by ""sweet"", I do not mean sickly sweet like some Disney-esque treacle that makes you want to vomit, I mean four immensely appealing actors, playing truly lovable characters (yes, even Margo Leadbetter is lovable in her own insecure, wannabe snob sort of way). The Goods enjoy a warm, happy marriage, and genuine friendship with their neighbors, the Leadbetters, and you cannot help but smile and cheer for them, as they stand by each other through thick and thin. ""The Good Life"" is an ideal program for a family to watch together, or for anyone who is feeling down on a rainy day.

2204659,4,B000784WKO,"Firstly, I absolutely love this Britcom and can probably recite every word of every episode having taped them many years ago.  I was ecstatic when the DVD became available and bought it.  The pictures are so clear it was like seeing it for the first time.  However, they have omitted episodes, i.e., the very last one entitled, ""Anniversary.""  The G.N. officionados will know which one I refer to.  For all others, this deals with a celebration of Tom's birthday/anniversary of their self sufficient lifestyle, which unhappily is marred by the trashing of the Goods' house by vandals.  They decide not let this setback discourage them from continuing their unorthodox lifestyle and the episode and series end with the four friends clinking champagne glasses and toasting, ""Here's to the Good Life!""  A very fitting end to a classic Britcom.  Too bad they omitted it.",1119225600,,866,5.006993006993007
2204660,5,B000784WKO,"Penelope steals the show even though she was initially envisioned as a minor character. This was her big break and this program propelled her into stardom.

2204663,5,B000784WKO,"I loved this stuff when I was a child. It tells the tale of Tom and Barbara Goode and their attempts to live the self sufficient life, turning their backs on the rat race, and doing it in London surburbia; under the watchful eye of their freinds and snobby neighbours, Jerry and Margot Ledbetter.

 In my country the series is know as, ""The Good Life"" and the gentle hilarity that ensues as the mini farm grows,is outstanding. Richard Briers is energetic and naughty as Tom while Felicity Kendall, as Barbara, is sweet and cute (Felicity Kendall was huge British pin up in her time and you can see why in this series).

 The late Paul Eddington is very funny as the long suffering Jerry but for me the show is always about the insufferably snobby Margot, Penelope Keith, who is forever on the look out to keep up middle class standards; her accent makes the Queen sound a little common! Fabulous nostalgic stuff!",1110931200,,912,4.576687116564417
2204664,5,B000784WKO,"Definitely up there with Fawlty Towers in the running for best British comedy.

A wonderful cast that does a wonderful job. Starring Richard Briers, Felicity Kendal, Penelope Keith, and Paul Eddington whom you may have seen in many other great Britcoms.

 As others have said, I'm glad this is finally coming out on DVD.",1110585600,,320,4.888888888888889
2204665,5,B000784WKO,"Glad to see The Good Neighbors series is finally coming out on DVD. Of course they do this after I just bought 4 or 5 vhs editions of the series this past Christmas.
The Good Neighbors is classic British comedy at its best. Very, very funny. Tom and Barbara along with Jerry and Margo are classic characters and now seem like close friends to me now since watching and rewatching this series many times from the  80's to the present. If you have never viewed this series, don't wait any longer. It doesn't get any better than the Good Neighbors!

This collection gathers together the first three series' of the class-conscious, farcical late-seventies Britcom about two sets of neighbors on opposite ends of the consumerist spectrum. Known as THE GOOD LIFE in the UK, the genial show stars Richard Briers, Paul Eddington, Penelope Keith, and Felicity Kendal, who provide a highly comedic look at British suburban life. was listed as one of the top ten British sitcoms of all time.

2204666,5,B000784WKO,"It appears the BBC is releasing this series 1-3, but for some reason can't release series 4 because that's already been released by Acorn Media?  Looks like the Acorn Media set has gone to ""used"" only now on Amazon.

I sure wish the BBC will release the 4th season and Royal performance themselves...",1109635200,,300,4.6415094339622645
2204667,5,B000784WKO,"I can't review this specific DVD set, as it has not been released yet at this time.  But I own all of these episodes on VHS, and so had to write something to encourage anyone looking at this item to purchase it.

""The Good Life"" is at its base the story of Tom and Barbara Good, a happily married couple living in Surbiton, a London suburb.  Tom designs toy prizes for cereal boxes until the night he decides that he and Barbara should try something new: living in an entirely self-sufficient manner.  What this translates to is transforming their suburban home into a smallholding (farm).

How this happens, and the Good's adventures in farming, are only part of the humor.  Tom and Barbara are funny, but it's their neighbor, Margot Leadbetter, who makes tis show really stand out.  Margot's husband Jerry used to be Tom's boss, and they've all been friends for a long time.  Margot is a dreadful snob, even thought deep down she truly is a good and caring friend.  It's an indication of the writing quality (and the quality of Penelope Keith's performance) that while Margot could have become a caricature, she never does.  Instead she is slowly revealed as a fascinating and affectionate woman who, although she thinks Tom and Barbara are crazy, nonetheless loves them and wants to be their friend.

The actors are all solid, and soldily funny, the concept cute and fertile ground for jokes, but it's the timelessness and non-gimicky friendship of the show's characters, and the solid cast, that makes ""The Good Life"" a classic, not just in British comedy, but all comedy.  The fact that this show was selected to do a Royal Command Performance will give some indication of how enormously popular and funny it was.

If you like ""Fawlty Towers,"" ""The Office,"" ""Father Ted,"" etc., you will love The Good Life.  If you like American shows like ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" ""Friends"", ""Arrested Development"", you will also love The Good Life.

I can't say enough good things!  I am thrilled to see this will be released on DVD soon!",1109548800,,2030,4.757142857142857

8045621,5,B000784WKO,"Known as The Good Life in the UK, this series was, and still is, enormously popular and greatly loved, this side of the Atlantic.  It made stars of the 4 main cast, and self sufficiency became the big craze of the '70s.  Telling the story of Barbara and Tom Good and their neighbours, Margo and Jerry, the story is safe, family watching.  No crude jokes or innuendoes, just good old fun, fun, fun.  I have watched and re-watched the series many times over the years and it is always fresh.  Some of the jokes may not have meaning for Americans, but overall, everyone can enjoy this series, which has the superb writing of Esmond and Larbey.  It is almost sad the think the 4 main characters were only fictional, the acting is so good.
