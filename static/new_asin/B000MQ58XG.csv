The Cinematography is fabulous but how could it not with such magnificent scenery. If you ever wanted to escape into another place for awhile Glenbogle is the place to go. You become one of the family as they all do their parts to keep the house going day to day, the lands preserved and the wildlife taken care of to save this beautiful estate. And in between all that the best part is getting to know the people there. It goes without saying that the writing is spectacular or else you wouldn't be drawn in. Spend some time on the Glen, you won't regret making the acquaintances there.",1392076800,,714,4.458015267175573
8170731,4,B000MQ58XG,"This series has been one of the best.  It is visually beautiful with funny quirky  Scottish characters who are very endearing.  The earlier episodes with Hector, Archie and Lexie were certainly the best and by far my favourites, but the latter series fortunately still has the lovely Molly, Duncan and Golly. The stories are funny, sometimes a little sad and later episodes have introduced some new characters who have changed it quite a lot. Although it lost a lot of it's appeal in the last few series I still felt a wrench when it finally ended.  We could all benefit from something similar nowadays instead of so many doom and gloom series with far too much violence. If you are a lover of gentle funny TV with a little nostalgia, you can't go wrong with this one.",1243468800,,768,4.583941605839416
8170732,4,B000MQ58XG,"I got this Monarch of the Glen series 5 & 6 for my Wife's birthday this year ( it started in Mid February and will come to a close Mid March when her last gift arrives).
  She has been a LONG TIME FAN of this series on PBS. I have found myself getting involved in some of the episodes ( which for a guy that likes to have at least one car chase, one car flip, and some kind of irish-Kung fu brawl per movie is saying alot!)
Great series, I am amazed at the quality and writing and casting of some of this British stuff. It really goes down well!  I  would recommend this to those that like reasonable melodrama, something for all ages, and breathtaking scenery!",1236902400,,661,4.140625
8170733,5,B000MQ58XG,It was great to finally be able to purchase the rest of the series.  We had a marathon over the holidays and watch Seasons 1 - 7.  It was great!  A pleasure to watch.,1232755200,,166,3.823529411764706
8170734,5,B000MQ58XG,I have the entire set of this show and if you don't you need to hurry and order it immediately! This is a treasure!,1215302400,,115,3.8333333333333335
8170735,5,B000MQ58XG,"Excellent series.  Now am in possession of entire series 1 - 7.  Show projects an enjoyable, comfortable, humorous depiction of contemporary life of a Scotish Laird.",1204070400,,165,5.3076923076923075
8170736,5,B000MQ58XG,"I visited Scotland this past August.  I love Monarch of the Glen because of the lovely, beautiful scenery, the sound of the bagpipes and being able to listen to the Scottish dialect again especially in Lexie, Golly and Duncan.",1193529600,,226,4.794871794871795
8170737,5,B000MQ58XG,"This is a great series that continually evolves over seven seasons. Some may miss the energy that existed between earlier characters but the newcomers keep things lively. If there is any criticism it might be that too many characters leave the series in short succession leaving little time for the writers to evolve the replacements. But overall the new characters work quite well.

Some reviewers label this series a ""soap opera"",  a characterization with which I strongly disagree. The series revolves around personal relationships, but what truly engaging story doesn't? In American soap operas the relationships center around jealousy, lust, and betrayal. Monarch of the Glen is sprinkled with humor, pathos, and uniquely, people who ultimately show a lot of character. Hardly a formula for soap opera.

The scenery is marvelous but is by no means the main point. Good writing and acting consistently steal the scene.",1191974400,5,922,5.258503401360544
8170738,4,B000MQ58XG,"I never ever tire of watching this show!  I only give it 4 stars, however, because I am deeply saddened that Archie leaves...and Lexie leaves...and Duncan leaves!!  AAAHHH!  No one wants to live at Glenbogle anymore?  I do, I do!  The scenery still takes my breath away and I long to go to Spey Valley and dream about the fabulously fictitious Glenbogle and its whimsical crew.  Molly and Golly, are they meant to be?  Lexie struggles with life in New Zealand, will she find her way home?  Paul is the new laird and he has the usual host of craziness to cope with, as well as his own love life.  Just who it will be remains to be seen, but Glenbogle is growing on him as he learns what it means to be a part of the magic.  So many new characters one by one gently fill in the holes of the changing casts, but the freshness of the storylines and always superb acting bring me back time and again.  I am so excited, think I'll pop it into the DVD player and watch more tonight!  If you're a fan, you'll NEED to find out what happens next!  Archie may not be there, but the wit and adventure that is Monarch of the Glen still Reigns Supreme!",1182902400,11,1138,4.188940092165899
