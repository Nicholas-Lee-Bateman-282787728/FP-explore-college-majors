8288055,5,B001CK7OO2,Through this film i found the reason to give/donate and not to whine. These kids have seen more than most of adults have yet they carry smiles on their faces. Behind these smiles and wonderful voices lay tears of loss and sickness. I am an orphan myself yet my grief is no match to theirs.,1480204800,,289,4.2727272727272725

8288060,4,B001CK7OO2,"Paul Taylor, writer and director, opens this beautiful documentary with a group of African children being awakened in the morning like kids anywhere, the difference being that these children live in The Agape Orphanage in South Africa. Their parents were the victims of AIDS. It is estimated there are 1.2 million AIDS orphans in Africa. Agape serves about 50 of these children. Music is a big part of the life of Agape as it is all throughout South Africa. As we enter the story, the children are rehearsing for a trip to England where they will perform to help raise money for the home. The story takes several turns as the trip to England is cancelled and two tragedies strike the home and the children during the three years of filming. Along the journey we get to meet and know 12 year old Slindile and her siblings along with many other children and get to know a culture so much different from our own. The music will inspire and uplift you as well as the infectious personalities of the children. The film is worth watching just to see the recording session in the studio of 'O Happy Day'. If you somehow feel we are suffering in our country because of the economy, etc., watch this movie. It will make your day. I believe you will realize how much we have in comparison to the rest of the world, even with our challenges. Highly recommend. [...]",1227312000,7,1354,4.530612244897959
8288061,5,B001CK7OO2,"I saw this on PBS.  It is the story of an orphanage called Agape in South Africa and the children of Agape.  All the children have been through difficult lives and many have lost their parents through AIDS.  The most charasmatic of the children is 12-year-old Slindile who's brother is also dying of AIDS and the parents are already dead.

It's a must-see!  I bought this DVD for all my relatives for Christmas gift giving.  I will never forget these kids!",1221264000,4,456,4.567901234567901
8288062,5,B001CK7OO2,"Since it hasn't been released yet, I obviously haven't seen the DVD, but last week I stumbled upon the program on HBO when construction crews outside were driving me insane for the third day in a row, and had actually succeeded in trapping me in my house that afternoon (unless I wanted to scale a 4 foot wall).  After a few minutes I didn't care that I couldn't get out, because I had no desire to leave.  This story will take you to the extremes of emotion.  We can learn an important lesson from these children.  In the midst of despair and disaster they still find hope, joy, and belief in the future.",1219968000,11,605,4.327433628318584
