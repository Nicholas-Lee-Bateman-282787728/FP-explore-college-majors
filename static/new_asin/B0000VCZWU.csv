1952785,3,B0000VCZWU,"Hammer was former football star Fred Williamson's first starring role. (It was also his football nickname.) This 1972 AIP production is quite satisfying. It's not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B0006GAO5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>&nbsp;and it's not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raging-Bull/dp/0792833236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raging Bull</a>, but to be fair, Hammer predates those iconic pugilist films by four and eight years, respectively. The dockworker-as-heavyweight is certainly reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Waterfront/dp/B00003CXBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Waterfront</a>, however.

Williamson has the athleticism and bravado to fill the leading man's shoes in this genre, as he would later prove in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Caesar/dp/B000053VB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Caesar</a>.

(She's not, but evidently I am not the only one who thinks so.) Good actress, too. Wish there was even more of her in this instead of that piggish honkey tramp.

Good car chase and nice humour counterbalance; witness the ex-girlfriend turned 'ho. Hammer also boasts one of the funkiest blacksploitation soundtracks I have heard--that's sayin' sumthin'!--by Solomon Burke, but sadly it looks unavailable, if it was ever released at all.

1952786,3,B0000VCZWU,"this was Fred Williamson's first major lead role, following supporting roles in films and TV like M*A*S*H and JULIA.  In this, he's B.J. Hammer; a Philadelphia transplant now earning a living as a dockworker in Los Angeles, he stumbles on a mob ""protection"" shakedown at his job.  After beating up a roughneck, he's introduced to a local ""fixer"", Big Sid (Charles Lampkin) , a boxing manager who promises to make B.J. a champ.

B.J. reluctantly agrees-- he knows Sid's outfit is shady, but he intends to make the most of it.  Mel Stewart is the Professor, who trains B.J.  We learn that the Prof was a boxer as well- and Sid was his manager-- but fell on hard times, thanks in part to Sid's shadiness.  William Smith is Brenner, Sid's chief enforcer.  Vonetta McGee is Lois, Sid's secretary-  She really likes B.J., and doesn't want to see him get hurt.  Bernie Hamilton (who went on to play Capt. Dobey on TV's ""Starsky & Hutch"") is Det. Davis, a cop out to bust Sid's operation, who offers friendly warnings to B.J. about getting in too deep.  The plot follows a certain formula, and is given a black-culture twist:  Sid sets up B.J. to fight palookas, and as B.J. starts rising in the boxing ranks-- and making decent money-- many in his old 'hood start accusing him of being a sellout; even his old pool-hall buddies turn their back on him; separate confrontations with a militant and a hooker are among the more amusing asides in the film.

The film's climax is set up when Sid's Mob overseers decide that B.J. will take a fall in his next bout-- the state heavyweight championship against Irish Joe Brady.  The Professor won't co-sign on the con, and he gets a fatal beating for his trouble-- on top of that, Lois is kidnapped, to force B.J. to cooperate.  B.J. then decides that all bets are off, and he decides to win the fight, and then takes the fight to Brenner & his goons.

Black action fans should note bit parts here by genre regular D'Urville Martin (""Black Caesar"", ""Dolemite""), and future ""Penitentiary"" star Leon Isaac (Kennedy).",1158451200,7,2048,4.634349030470914
1952787,3,B0000VCZWU,"How ironic!  Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson plays Hammer!  Since I'm the first reviewing this, I guess I'm obligated to give you the plot.  Hammer gets a job boxing for the mob.  There he meets Lois, and like Tears For Fears, he's Head Over Heels and not long after that he Sowing His Seeds Of Love.  Soon the head honcho is wanting Hammer to take a fall in the ring, and do you really think Hammer's gonna do this?  As an incentive they kidnap the woman he loves.  This leads to the final showdown!  I wanted to like this more than I did.  It's not bad by any means, but it's not dramatic enough for you to really care about anyone, and there's not enough action to carry the film as a cheap action flick either.  It's just kinda stuck in a so-so kind of place.  Williamson is cool and badass as usual.  He's always worth watching.  Supporting cast is nothing to brag about though B movie tough guy William Smith is cool as a mob henchman.  He's kinda underused though.  Recommended if you're into the blaxploitation genre, are a Williamson fan, and can find it cheap.",1136678400,7,1067,4.372448979591836

8003759,2,B0000VCZWU,"Fred Williamson was a bit of a renaissance man for his time. The ex-pro football player who went on to achieve fame and fortune in the movies was the first mega male star in the Blaxploitation genre. But he was more than just an actor, producing and writing many of the films he later starred in as well as providing jobs for people of color behind the scenes. His success was made from his turning around and investing himself and his money in the business as opposed to be handed the keys to the kingdom. In return he had a long and successful career that was well earned.

In this film Williamson stars as B.J. Hammer, a dock worker who tires of seeing a friend beat up by a union boss who actually works for the mob. When a fist fight breaks out and he takes down the man, the word gets out and the same mob boss thinks he may have a new fighter to place in the ring. Hammer is given the chance to become a prize fighter and he takes it.

What he doesnt realize is that the fight game is not as clear cut as one would think. His trainer and manager is on the level but the promoters are not. When the promoter (Charles Lumpkin) tells him to take a dive, Hammer refuses and the result is the near death beating of his trainer. As with most films in this genre that sets Hammer out on a path of revenge against the men behind the scenes, Mr. Big and his henchmen.

Williamson turns in a decent performance here but nothing stupendous. Keep in mind this was early in his career and he kept getting better with each and every role. William Smith as the hired muscle for the main bad guy does a nice job as he always did in roles like this. His was one of those faces where most see him and say Oh yeah, that guy without realizing his name. The threatening nature of his character here is well done but funny in some ways as well.

While this is not the best example of the genre it is one that deserves mention and notice. As I said, Williamson went on to more major roles in studio made pictures as well as making his own films at the same time. It was a successful business plan that not only brought more people of color into the fold but placed them in better positions than most had in the past. Films from the genre of Blaxploitation need to be recognized and watched so that others will learn the history of films from the 70s and 80s that helped advance the way things were to the way they are now. While not the best Williamson film, this is a great way to begin to discover where it all began.",1438300800,,2503,4.154639175257732
