2909650,5,B000TSTEPK,"Don't waste valuable time reading reviews; just go ahead and get it like you know you're going to.  This is our current all-time favorite show, and we watch the episodes over and over.  The third series is every bit as good as the previous two, and doesn't get maudlin at the end.  I love the lack of sentimentality, the constancy of the characters.  Simon Pegg is a brilliant guest star.  The only thing that's missing is the commentary, which on the first two discs is like getting double the number of episodes.  When the complete box set with third season commentary comes out, I'll be at the front of the line.  Sorry, queue.",1200614400,4,630,4.522123893805309
2909651,5,B000TSTEPK,I love Black Books! My gf got me into this BBC Comedy series. Wonderful episode with Simon Pegg from Shaun of the dead! Probably my favorite one!,1198454400,3,145,4.407407407407407
2909652,3,B000TSTEPK,"After waiting nearly a year for this to be released in the US, I couldn't help feeling that the show had reached it's peak in season 2.  Overall, somewhat disappointing.",1197763200,2,169,4.633333333333334
2909653,5,B000TSTEPK,"This third series is as good the first two series if not better.
The opening episode is one of the best of all. A competitor bookshop 'Goliath Books' has opened next door and Manny (Bill Bailey) is now working there. He left 'Black Books' after his hand was burnt by Bernard. Simon Pegg plays the Manager of Goliath books and really adds another dimension to the show. Shame he couldn't have done more. This episode is absolutely brilliant and I must have watched 8 or 9 time now.

The episode 'Moo-Ma and Moo-Pa' contains perhaps the most surreal moment of the entire series when Bernard and Fran go a under a dinner table in a restaurant to pick up a piece of cutlery and there is a whole bar under the table! In case you hadn't worked it out Moo-Ma and Moo-Pa are Manny's parents who come down to visit, much to Bernards disgust.

Sadly there is no commentary on the series 3 disc. The commentaries on series 1 & 2 were almost as good as the shows themselves. However the out-takes and deleted scenes are good, and as whole the DVD easily merits 5 stars.",1189728000,15,1057,4.387755102040816

2909656,5,B000TSTEPK,"If you like Monty Python or Jim Carrey you'll enjoy this quirky, over-the-top series.  I wish there were more of these!",1415750400,,119,4.666666666666667
2909657,5,B000TSTEPK,"I think I love this series more than I love the IT Crowd, and that is saying a lot. What can go wrong with a misanthropic book store owner, an abrasive and mostly unemployed female friend, and a loopy former accountant turned manservant? A lot, and it's entirely funny. The comedy trio of Moran, Grieg, and Bailey cannot be beat and the writers and director of the show are amazing. It's just too bad that there are only 3 seasons and 18 shows total. I watch this series in its entirety at least every two years, and it continues to make me laugh every time. If you like dry, wacky British comedy, this is for you. Be careful, though; you might be influenced to drink a bit too much wine.",1414108800,2,688,4.3

2909663,5,B000TSTEPK,"If your into English humor this is a good investment.

Somebody really put an effort into the Main Menu page.  Its a full clip of people walking by the bookshop.  The various menus are displayed in the Bookshop windows.  I watched this for several minutes before figuring it out.  LOL

There are 6 episodes and specials on one disk.

2909664,5,B000TSTEPK,I love this series. After watching all three series (seasons for us Americans) I want to open a book store and treat my customers like crap. Not a great way to make a living but it looks like fun.,1299715200,,196,4.051282051282051
2909665,5,B000TSTEPK,"I believe season three is actually better than season two. The plots are fantastic in this series, and I love the episode when Manny's parents come to stay. My friends are such fans of the show, that they now call the grandparents of their newly born son ""moo ma"" and ""moo pa"" ... makes me laugh every time. The final episode is fantastic.",1288483200,,339,4.396825396825397
2909666,5,B000TSTEPK,"Dylan Moran and crew are at it again!  His character, Bernard, is hilarious!  And Bill Bailey is adorable!  Anyone who likes 'dry humor' will love Black Books!  My advice is to watch the first two seasons before this one to see the growth of the characters.",1269216000,,257,4.521739130434782
2909667,2,B000TSTEPK,"Wanted a DVD, not a VHS, so was a little disappointed. It's my own fault for not reading carefully. Good postage, especially considering was before Christmas.",1266278400,,158,5.115384615384615
2909668,4,B000TSTEPK,"Sadly, it is the last season of Black Books available.  Sadder still, it was also the worst of the 3.  The shop seemed uncharacteristically clean.....  The characters too seemed tamed and eager to finish up the show.  The writing was a bit too lagged and the comedy just wasn't the same.  Worth a watch, but maybe better to watch in reverse succession.",1232236800,3,352,4.612903225806452
2909669,5,B000TSTEPK,"The third series of Black Books for me is by far the best of the series, winning legions of fans and winning a BAFTA to boot. Two episodes in particular, no, never mind, I lied: they're all amazing.

In an episode where Bernard and Manny write a Children's Book, I laughed so hard, I nearly ejected my spleen.
In the final episode---which is the best ending of a series I've ever seen--- Bernard comes home from a party he's been dragged to and when told that it was fun replies, ""The food was cold. The drinks were few. The people were many. It was everything I expected. And less."" The episode continues on to complete hysterical drunken mayhem. I kept having to pause the DVD to laugh so I wouldn't miss anything.

I so enjoyed the third series on Netflix that I've bought all three series on Amazon so I can go back and collect the nuggets of comedic gold I missed the first time around.
During uncertain times, the comedy of Dylan Moran is certainly a balm for the soul.",1226707200,6,975,4.3812154696132595
2909670,5,B000TSTEPK,"Black Books 3 is as deliciously funny as the first two seasons. Bernard Black, Fran and Manny are back and they're the same anti-social, insane and bumbling trio we adore from the first seasons. Dylan portrays Bernard Black; a wine-guzzling, cigarette smoking, Irishman, and he plays it so well. All of his mannerisms are hilarious and you never know what he's going to do next. He's definitely my favorite character. I only wish their seasons were longer. Each season has 6 episodes that will still keep you laughing even after you've watched them for the third or fourth time. I know some people just don't get British humor, but this show is entertaining for anyone looking for humor, wit, and a some good old fashioned physical comedy. If you've never seen it, I recommend you see it from the beginning. The first episode of the first season is one of my all-time favorites. And in this third season, my favorite episode would have to be Elephants and Hens in which Bernard and Manny have bet Fran that they can write a children's book in one night and they have another bet that Fran will have an awful time with her friends that same night. Black Books is one of my favorite shows and everyone I've played it for has loved it too.",1219968000,4,1236,4.572072072072072
2909671,5,B000TSTEPK,"I have been in love with this series for quite some time--its inane comedy is the sort of relief that so many of us wish that we could get away with in our daily lives.  Bernard Black is a grumpy, sarcastic, caustic character who speaks aloud all the naughty things that the voices in the back of our heads say.
For a crazy good laugh and the release of some stress that bogs down all working people, try Black Books!",1212364800,3,417,4.2125
2909672,5,B000TSTEPK,"From purchase to getting in the mail, the entire process was easy and dependable and wonderful!

2909673,5,B000TSTEPK,"This is as funny as the first two series, although it's hard to beat Manny playing a duet inside a piano with a pair of spoons (series 2).  Dylan Moran is as funny as Foster Brooks and as screwed up as Basil Fawlty.",1200614400,3,215,4.0
