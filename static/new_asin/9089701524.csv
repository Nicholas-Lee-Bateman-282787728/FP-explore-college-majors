1172677,5,9089701524,"I cannot even describe how beautiful this dvd is. I own about 20 of the Helsloot dvds and this stands out as one of the best. It's slow paced and entrancing. The birds are gorgeous, really something to be excited about! There are short films with nature sounds or music. There is no plot, just beautiful scenery and birds. I use these videos to entertain my pets and for my pleasure as background imagery. I find the videos with the nature sounds (without music) help me relax when studying.",1425686400,3,491,4.52808988764045

1172681,5,9089701524,"this is the second DVD I've purchased in this series and I am realy enjoying them.
I like the music used on these DVD's but mostly I like the option to view with the
naural sounds of nature. Just have to decide which one to purchase next.",1408320000,2,238,4.085106382978723
1172682,3,9089701524,"While scenes were pretty, I was very disappointed to find the DVD has background music.  I love all my other relaxation DVD's that have the option of just nature sounds which is my preference.  DVD is fine for what it is; just happens to not be what I thought it would be.",1407456000,10,272,4.211538461538462

1172684,5,9089701524,"I love nature, wildlife, birds, etc so this DVD is perfect for me. Calming scenes and music, what more can you ask for in a nature DVD? The photography is excellent- there is no downside to this DVD that I could find. LOVE IT!",1386288000,5,226,4.159090909090909
1172685,5,9089701524,We love this DVD.  It has a very calming effect.  It is great for the elderly population and assisted living facilities.,1383004800,3,120,4.666666666666667
1172686,5,9089701524,"When I purchased this dvd I had very high expectations after viewing the preview. My expectations were not only met but exceeded!! I put this on when I'm reading or listening to music or just watch and listen. With the world seeming to get crazier by the day, this video and others like them are sorely needed. At least for me. I have bought and will continue to buy  dvd's from Ambient_collection. In my humble opinion the videos are not only wonderfully made but are worth their weight in gold.",1376006400,8,496,4.511111111111111

We have beautiful sceneries on what other wise would be a big black rectangle on our walls. The music if you chose to have it on, is soft calming and easy back ground music while entertaining. LOVE THESE PRODUCT AND THIS COMPANY.
I receive no compensation of any sort for this review. I just really enjoy these products.",1448323200,,474,4.386363636363637
7901334,5,9089701524,"This dvd is a hit with our groups that meet for coffee.  It is just lovely.  Some scenes with ducks gliding across a lake with the fog lifting in the morning light, the swans are beautiful and the ducks splashing around are entertaining.  The sounds are great and the music fits.  Smooth transitions from scene to scene.  Great dvd.",1445817600,,332,4.559322033898305

7901337,4,9089701524,"While most of the videos are pretty repetitive, the photography is nice & the music and natural sounds of the birds are both very soothing.  It accomplishes its' purpose & one of the videos (Daytime or Daylight, something like that) has absolutely fabulous shots of cute duckies!",1433548800,,279,4.9361702127659575
