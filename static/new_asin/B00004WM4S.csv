7925560,2,B00004WM4S,"I am the woman who gave birth at home, 25 years ago, on that video.  I was approached by the videographer who said that he still needed to find a willing home birth for his client, a small (may I repeat, SMALL) birthing centre in Oregon.  I agreed, because I feel passionately about informing women about their choices.  The internet was not a 'thing', and Oregon was a long way a way.  It was a bloody hard and long back labour, but I still managed it, and my baby is now a 25 year old woman, so it turned out ok.
Here's where I've experienced pain and upset in the past.
This video went nationwide within a couple of years.  I heard that Barbara Harper was not fair to the couple who both made and produced the video.  What was a small project suddenly had me receiving phone calls from people all over the states that I had known.
I had people come up to me on the street and congratulate me; people I didn't know, and with whom I had NO desire to discuss my birth.

I am glad BH was successful in spreading the good news about home birthing.  I have never quite gotten over the nationwide viewing of my birth, which I thought would just sit quietly on the shelves of an Oregon birthing centre for a few years.  I am equally disgruntled that I got word back that the immense success of the video did not trickle down to the filmers and producers, and most certainly none of the women that I know of, who gave their most precious moment to spread the courage and strength of alternatives to hospitals.

It's now 25 years old. I feel sure it must be time for this video to retire and something more current to be made.

I wish I could have known, or been warned, that this video would be out there forever. I was not prepared to share my birth on that level.",1495411200,2,1759,4.205357142857143

7925563,5,B00004WM4S,I teach a college level class at my high school.  I show this documentary in both my Child Development class and my Human Growth and Development class.  It is a wonderful illustration of alternative birth options to the institutionalized hospital way of giving birth.,1362182400,,267,5.045454545454546
7925564,5,B00004WM4S,"My first birth was a managed birth at the hospital.  Everything, from the start of my labor to the cutting of my perineum was managed by an obstetrician.  For my second birth I wanted something better.  My local library had a copy of this video and I checked it out to view.  Turns out it was very reassuring.  Sure, there are some things I don't agree with and in some cases the births were a little managed.  But nothing compared to what happens in the hospital.

My 2 year old daughter really liked watching the videos and I felt reassured that she wouldn't be scared to see me laboring as I would be giving birth at home with the assistance of a midwife.

Regarding the last review (below), there should be no law requiring you to give birth using an obstetrician and a hospital.  America has the highest infant mortality rate of industrialized countries, doesn't that mean anything?  I believe all low-risk pregnancies should be cared for by midwives, not obstetricians who are trained for high-risks pregnancies.

7925565,5,B00004WM4S,"This is the most wonderful video for the whole family. I am a mother of two children, one born at home underwater and one born in a hospital with a CNM. This video is great at preparing you mentally for the natural birthing experience. My 2 year old loved this video and my husband enjoyed it also. Lets you see how wonderful and fufilling the birth and labor process can be. I recommend this to everyone even if your not pregnant.",997401600,6,431,4.333333333333333
7925566,5,B00004WM4S,"As a natural childbirth instructor, I am always on the lookout for videos that are respectful of the women birthing in them.  This video shows women birthing at home, in birth centers, squatting, standing and more.
This video shows the women working and rejoicing in natural birth and the emotional impact on their families and those around them.
In between births are segments by Dr. Marsden Wagner, Dr. Michael Rosenthal, Barbara Harper, RN, and several midwives.  They comment on the safety of midwifery and alternative birthing settings and caution against the overuse of technology, while an appropriate use of minor intervention is shown when necessary.
Although I watch childbirth videos several times a week for my classes, I still can't make it through this one with dry eyes.
Two thumbs up!",986947200,7,800,5.099236641221374
