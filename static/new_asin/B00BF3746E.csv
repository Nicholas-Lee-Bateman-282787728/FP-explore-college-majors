8567548,5,B00BF3746E,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD on how they captured the male snow leopard, how gentle they were in handling this beautiful cat, by examination and putting a collar on him. It was amusing to watch the cat stagger like a drunkard as he tried to climb up the rocks to get to the top, he did slip and fell but he was OK and had a good recovery from the sedation.",1447632000,,362,4.041666666666667
8567549,2,B00BF3746E,"What a disappointment. Turned out to be little more than a promotional video for the big mouthed American tracker. Trying to be some kind of ""crocodile hunter"" character. Very little footage or info on the actual subject - snow leopards! The BBC documentary is many times better IMHO.",1445299200,3,284,4.9375

8567551,4,B00BF3746E,Was very informative loved the background. Would have liked it to be longer for the money I payed. Beautiful cat I hope they can help it flourish,1377388800,2,145,4.407407407407407
8567552,1,B00BF3746E,"The snow leopard is an elusive cat.  They are endangered and their numbers are small.  Having said that, this offering is more about how not to find the leopard.  There are more shots of the crew and Mr. Boone doing very little than there are of actual cats.  Very disappointing.",1375315200,5,279,4.52
