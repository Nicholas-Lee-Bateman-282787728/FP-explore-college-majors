8695838,5,B00RU4B742,"Very interesting look at the inside of a (hopefully) post doping era cycling team.  I especially liked the behind the scenes race discussions, the pre-race briefings and the post race celebrations and sometimes outbursts. As opposed to many cycling documentaries that follow TDF teams, this team actually won, pretty spectacularly actually, so that was fun to see.

The camera crew did a good job asking a few tough questions about doping.  The team doctor even empties his medicine bottle showing the different pills he carries.

While doping was discussed quite a bit, it didn't overpower the rest of the documentary though.  A lot of it was simply focused on the team and the staff as they go through the exhausting roller coaster of the tour.",1436918400,2,746,4.936
