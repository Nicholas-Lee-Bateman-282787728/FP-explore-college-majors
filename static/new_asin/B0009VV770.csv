8324965,5,B0009VV770,"This is the first Filipino movie I've seen since I left the Philippines when I was 10 years old.  I loved every part of the movie. My daughter who can't even understand Tagalog loves to watch it over and over again.  Her favorite (and mine) is the ending.  I don't really want to give any part of the movie away.  So just take my word for it.  You will love this movie and you will want to hear her sing the song ""All My Life"". Regine sings it beautifully.

By the way, Christopher De Leon is drop dead gorgeous. He's like fine wine, he only gets better with time.",1336608000,,564,4.128440366972477
