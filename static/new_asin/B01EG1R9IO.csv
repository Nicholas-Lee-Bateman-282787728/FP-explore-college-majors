7734692,2,B01EG1R9IO,"Ripped off!!! I thought this was the film "" Raiders the Adaption"" Although interesting in certain areas, all this is , is a 90 minute "" Making Of"" documentary !!!  I made the mistake of ""buying"" it instead of renting it. Now I'm out $9.99 !!! Would love a refund but doesn't seem to be a way to email a ""real"" person. I'm really upset!!",1467417600,,336,4.1692307692307695
7734693,5,B01EG1R9IO,"Incredible film. Even if you're familiar with the story of ""The Raiders Guys"", you don't know half of the tale! Surprisingly emotional and at times shocking. A must-see doc.",1467072000,2,173,5.0
7734694,5,B01EG1R9IO,"This was every bit as good as we were hoping for. I've been following the progress of this doc ever since it was announced by Drafthouse Films, and when it was finally available to stream, we didn't hesitate. This was such a fantastic and highly entertaining documentary, even if you're not necessarily a fan of the Indie films, but who isn't?! Watch it! Easily one of the best docs we've seen in years.",1467072000,2,403,4.534246575342466
7734695,5,B01EG1R9IO,This has got to be the best documentary I've seen in years... I don't write many reviews but I just had to for this one. Saw a screening in Houston a few weeks ago and it blew me and my fianc&eacute; away.. We were expecting an entertaining film but it's actually quite moving as well. I can't recommend this movie enough. GO SEE IT!,1466899200,3,333,4.21875
7734696,5,B01EG1R9IO,Awesome documentary years in the making.  This is for anyone who has every had dreams and wanted to follow them no matter what.  Super inspiring and tons of laughs.  You can watch it with kids over age 10 as well.  Check it out!,1466899200,2,228,4.232558139534884

7734699,4,B01EG1R9IO,"A fun and well-made documentary. I had heard about the Raiders remake film done by children in Mississippi when it played at film festivals, but had never seen it, so was glad to find this documentary on Netflix. This is not the actual remake in its entirety, which would be cool to be able to see. But this is a compelling and humane documentary about how the remake was made and how it came to the attention of people like Eli Roth and eventually even Steven Spielberg and George ""Bacon Neck"" Lucas. Similar themes as the amazing documentary Burden of Dreams -- obsession, persistance, turmoil, etc -- about the making of Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. Basically this doc is Burden of Dreams but with nerd culture. And, interestingly, Klaus Kinski of Fitzcarraldo passed on a role in Raiders of the Lost Ark because he found the script ridiculous (which it kind of is, even though it's an iconic and entertaining film). This doc is also very funny. Some of the low budget and inexperienced/unsupervised stunts and special effects in the Raiders remake are downright reckless (and there were injuries). But I'd disagree with a critic who said the boy-filmmaker parents were somehow bad parents by not supervising the kids' summer productions of the film. It was a different time then, and something called free-range kids existed. The doc shows how the dysfunction in the kids' lives -- parents with alcohol abuse, poverty, domestic violence, and rampant divorce -- led to creativity and escape for the kids (and, sadly, a search for a male role mode in the character of ""Indiana Jones""). This is a worthwhile doc, very moving and inspirational for people who have a creative side and troubles with doing the expected, mainstream, corporate, obedient, ""sensible"" thing in life. Also, if you are Generation X, you probably remember seeing Raiders (the original) in the theatre and what a big deal it was. This doc captures nicely that time and energy. And it still blows my mind that the boy-filmmakers started making their film with no script or copy of the movie to work from -- they did it from memory (!) after seeing the film in the theatre.",1474848000,,2138,4.8283378746594
7734700,5,B01EG1R9IO,"This is the most awesome documentary ever made. A testament to passion, obsession, and never giving up. A must watch!",1474156800,2,117,4.9
7734701,5,B01EG1R9IO,This was so cool,1473206400,2,16,3.25
7734702,3,B01EG1R9IO,Was interesting. I watched the first bit and then the last 30 minutes.,1472774400,,70,4.461538461538462
7734703,5,B01EG1R9IO,"This movie is great. I loved the story of the kids starting a passion project just for their love of a film, and then returning years later as adults to complete it. This movie is highly entertaining, I was disappointed that we do not see the completed film being made by the children/adults though.",1472774400,,299,4.555555555555555
7734704,5,B01EG1R9IO,"What a great family film (don't miss out on watching it with kids--it will inspire them)--a hilarious (and moving) portrait of adolescence (parents will love it too--if the fire doesn't scare them half to death), a tribute to the power of following dreams, a sort of wacky intro to movie-making, especially fun for art lovers working in any genre--it's just so thrilling to watch that it's hard to put into words.",1471996800,3,413,4.830985915492958
7734705,4,B01EG1R9IO,"Fascinating for fans of the original Raiders of the Lost Ark. Even my 9 y.o. son enjoyed it. PRO TIP: watch this BEFORE you watch the fan film remake. It really helps you appreciate everything those kids, and their parents, went through in the years it took to make it.",1471219200,2,269,4.4

7734708,4,B01EG1R9IO,"Review-I can remember the first time I seen  Raiders of the Lost Ark at the movie theater. I was 13 years old, and ran out of the Village 6 Theaters telling my father I knew what i wanted to do with my life. Around the same time, a couple hours away from me was three 11 year old kids who set out to do a remake of this film. Three boys from Mississippi named Chris Strompolo, Jayson Lamb and Eric Zala. They were very passionate and decide to film the whole film shot by shot. Well, almost the whole film, the ending climax with the exploding airplane was not filmed. The story details the 3 guys now 25 years later, out to shoot this ending. Filmmakers Jeremy Coon and Tim Skousen followed the now middle-aged filmmakers once they learned of and saw the guys Raiders of the Lost Ark:. The documentary starts off when the three decide to start filming this ending to their film. We learn that thru kickstarter campaigns and other means, they are so enthusiastic about this demise of an airplane to complete their dream. The dedication to this film finishing is what makes this documentary such an interesting watch.

 The filmmakers have a wealth of footage from their teens. Some of the situations looked very insane like setting a mom;s basement on fire to capture the Nepalese bar scene from the original Raiders. The kicker is that they do not have any sort of safety equipment on hand. This documentary is such a love letter to the original Raiders film. I know I was in that mindset when I saw the film, and I think my brother and neighbors were as well. To watch this film and see how serious these guys were, with parents worried and the fear of being fired from a job, these guys never flinched. Given, that I just watched the Raiders film in the last month, to see this documentary really made the film such a bigger treasure to me. This documentary is very insightful and personal. It was like. I was peaking thru someones widow. I will say right now, if you are a fan of Lucas and the Indy, this documentary is a must watch. Just to see the child in all of us wake up, is such a refreshing change of pace on most documentaries that I get to watch. This is worth a peak.",1470614400,4,2182,4.356265356265356
7734709,5,B01EG1R9IO,It was perfect for what it was. A well done film. We were pleasantly surprised.,1469232000,,79,4.333333333333333
7734710,1,B01EG1R9IO,"Beware. The graphic and full title of this video is very misleading. It is not about the making of the classic Steven Spielberg Raiders of the Lost Ark movie! It is about some young people that made their own home, reenactment version, of each scene, which is admirable, but should be more clearer in the title and the graphic. When viewing available Amazon movie selections from my Sony Smart TV BlueRay DVD box internet connection, we do not get the normal full Amazon movie description and reviews page that one would get by going directly to the Amazon site online. Rented this for 4.99 and was very disappointed because it was misleading. Wish I could get my money back.",1469145600,,675,4.680672268907563
7734711,5,B01EG1R9IO,"Wow! For those of us who grew up with Raiders of the Lost Ark, it was a blast to see the story of these kids recreate the movie scene by scene. And the behind the scenes takes of actual footage (fire comes to mind) reminds me of growing up in the 70s and 80s when kids weren't as heavily supervised!!",1468627200,3,300,4.016666666666667
7734712,3,B01EG1R9IO,"Entertaining and sweet, though in terms of the way it constructs its narrative, this is a bit of a mess.",1468540800,,104,4.25
7734713,1,B01EG1R9IO,"Couldn't get through the first few minutes of it. A lot had to do with the poor video quality. The premise caught me, but the film didn't deliver. At least not at first. It's possible I didn't give it enough time to win me over. But I'm fairly impatient.",1468540800,,254,4.204081632653061
7734714,5,B01EG1R9IO,"So freshing,  what a pleasure to see fans truly enjoying and reimagining their favorite film.",1468540800,,93,5.2
7734715,5,B01EG1R9IO,"These kids in the 80's followed their dreams when they didn't know any better and it turns out they found out a lot about life. It wasn't easy and it wasn't a straight path, but in the end they followed through and finished it and their story has touched many lives. This is a really fun and poignant story and is told very well. Highly recommended.",1468108800,2,349,4.303030303030303
7734716,5,B01EG1R9IO,"I had heard about this quite a while ago, and although I have not seen the entire fan film I was pretty happy to see this documentary.  Great job!!",1467849600,2,147,4.068965517241379
7734717,3,B01EG1R9IO,"Fun documentary, but not really what I expected. This is NOT the story of the making of the Raiders adaptation, it's the story of cashing in on it years later. A good 80% of the film deals with the filmmakers trying to shoot the unfinished airplane sequence that they were unable to complete back in the day. It is interesting, but not the story that I wanted to see. Maybe others will enjoy it more, but I was disappointed.",1467849600,7,424,4.379746835443038
7734718,3,B01EG1R9IO,"Love what these 2 kids and now adults did (it will be great movie about making of this fan film movie) but the actually documentary was just not great. It was disjointed, didn't answer questions and took me way too long to even figure out who everyone was. This was really a trio, but the third guy was interviewed, but unsure if they ever made up or even had a talk. He appeared to be at the plane scene talking about how it wasn't a good idea and they cut cutting away. Literally cutting him off during sentences. I wanted to be inspired. I was more annoyed.",1467676800,2,560,4.242990654205608
8758515,3,B01EG1R9IO,It should have included the entire movie those guys made.  It was quite disappointing.,1501459200,,86,5.142857142857143
8758516,5,B01EG1R9IO,"This was an engrossing documentary about a group of kids and their hijinks while making a tribute film to their favorite film when they were young.  It was worked on off and on, and the ""behind the scenes"" footage that are this film make for a great time.

I think the only drawback is that by the end of the movie I was chomping at the bit to see the movie made by the kids, but it's not for sale.  I'm ready to see how bad it might be, but that just makes it better!  But alas, it doesn't seem to be an option.",1492732800,,512,3.894230769230769

8758518,5,B01EG1R9IO,Great film.  I know it doesn't include the actual fan film itself but that can be purchased from the filmmakers.  This is a very good documentary that I enjoyed a lot.,1485129600,,167,4.354838709677419
8758519,2,B01EG1R9IO,"The underlying story -- the pluck of a group of 11 yr olds to attempt something as ambitious as the shot-for-shot-remake -- is rich with charm, but the documentary is a little boring.",1485129600,,183,4.575757575757576

For any home video director and star, for anyone who dreamed of re-makingtheir favorite movie starring themselves, or enjoyed this growing up, for any Raiders fan, or any fan of the movies, gift yourself this hilarious, jubilant love-letter to making films. You will not believe how they recreated it and the matching scene-for scene duplication is incredible! Thanks Eric and Chris (and Eric's loyal wife!)",1484956800,,433,5.2

For a number of summers as they grow up the work on the project though with eventual conflict they complete the movie except for one scene. This follows them as they aspire to complete the movie.
