7815775,2,6301813111,"The dance moves in this DVD are too fast or too slow to most of the songs.  It's more like work than play.  However, I think it can be an effective work out because you can see the teacher and class sweating.  The dances in the 80's of this series are best because they are very fun and easy to follow and can be done at different levels of fitness.",1415059200,2,349,3.9571428571428573

7815777,1,6301813111,"I only had one tape player that could play this and when I did, the video tape was stretched and the video didn't work.  Therefore, there was no picture & the music/words were warbling.  My fault for getting an oldie & not a goodie. It was not amazon's fault, I chose this tape.",1340928000,,278,4.226415094339623

7815779,4,6301813111,"When you don't have a lot of time, this tape gives you a pretty good aerobic workout in 30 mintues (that includes warm-up and cool-down.)  Some of the moves are kind of corny but stick with it, and it gets your heart rate up to a moderate level.  The music is fun and a nice distraction, or just dance at your own pace - higher or lower intensity and enjoy!",1144368000,2,357,4.085714285714285
