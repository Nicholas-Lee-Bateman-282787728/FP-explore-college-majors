8651463,5,B00JJRLG76,"The re-creation and launching of the Colditz glider - this is great stuff! I remember watching the 1974 made-for-TV movie with David McCallum, and the story of the glider really stuck in my imagination. I was crushed, after reading Henry Chancellor's excellent 2002 book,

to find out that the real glider was constructed near the end of the war, and never actually launched.

For NOVA, Hugh Hunt, a British engineer and nephew of one of the true-life glider creators, goes to Colditz Castle in Germany. The castle is empty and near-derelict now, of no use except as a WWII tourist attraction. That's probably why Schloss Colditz allowed the re-creators to make a hole in the roof to get the glider out of the attic and onto the roof-top.

As I read the book, I was astounded at the creativity and ingenuity shown by the captured Allied officers. The NOVA story only reinforces that. For example, the re-creators have a whole attic to work in while making the glider. The original officers had 12 feet at one end of the same attic, blocked off by a fake wall that the Germans never discovered.

Several former Colditz prisoners speak, represented by older recorded interviews. Grismond Davies-Scourfield remembers, ""The Germans had this maddening phrase, they'd spout it at you when you were first captured... 'Fr Sie der Krieg ist vorbei.' For you the war is over. It jolly well wasn't going to be over! This was the one thing we could do - to escape!""

Other speakers are George Drew (former prisoner), L.J. 'Bill' Goldfinch (former prisoner and Hunt's uncle), Sir Sebastian Roberts (military historian), Kenneth Lockwood (former prisoner), J.W. 'Jack' Best (former prisoner), Tony Hoskins (modern glider builder), Tony Luteyn (former prisoner), Corran Purdon (former prisoner) and Ben Watkins (modern glider builder).

Goldfinch's detailed glider plans have been saved, and were followed in the re-creation. In the old interview, someone asks, ""Would it have flown?""
Jack Best replies, ""Oh yes. Don't you agree?"" (to Goldfinch)
Goldfinch replies, ""Well, I think it would have certainly descended to Earth.""

A very enjoyable show, made even more fun because I've read the book.
A 2008 mini-series was also produced, based on Chancellor's book, but I haven't seen that. Yet.
