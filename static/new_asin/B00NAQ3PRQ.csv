When I saw this movie, I really enjoy it and want to go back read its manga. This movie may be the best tokusatsu hero film because any young or old person actually enjoy it. A Serious movie! I That is what Japan hero lacks of. It have characters development and good lesson . Some pointed the story is big rip off Terminator...Really? Do you ever read its manga? Its more like Terminator ripped off this franchise. Yes, ""he"" got beat by a girl, So what? don't be sexist. Anyway, its top notch film and thats what tokusatsu hero films need to aims to be instead of being cheesy and silly all time.",1437004800,,725,4.260869565217392
8676842,5,B00NAQ3PRQ,"Kikaida got beat up by a girl but I liked this movie anyway. It was much better made than I expected. The plot is basically a rip-off of Terminator 2 and 3, as Kikaida goes through the same situations that Arnold Schwarzenegger did, though the feel of the movie is something more like Batman. So blame those movies for Kikaida being so pathetic. It's not that bad though because I realized that the girl is supposed to be Bijinda, she just didn't have her costume.

I hope they make a sequel to this movie with Kikaida 01 and give Bijinda her costume next time. Switch On! 1-2-3",1436486400,,578,4.401869158878505

Unfortunately, he got into 3 fights in this movie and won only one of them and also got beat up by a girl. I hope there is a sequel with Kikaider 01 in it and this time the producers have these super heroes win more than one fight and not lose to anymore girls. They should take a page out of the Avengers movie and see what makes these sci-fi characters tough and people wanting to see more.",1432512000,,464,4.166666666666667
