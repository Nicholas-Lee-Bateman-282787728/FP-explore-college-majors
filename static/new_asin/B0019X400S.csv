3444603,4,B0019X400S,"When the Japanese lost the war, this trauma had to be explained and given meaning.  Ironically, shortly after Hiroshima, certain Japanese films critiqued the aggressive militarism that led to the disaster [See Kurosawa's ""No Regrets for our Youth].  Then, the Japanese films changed. They stopped focusing on their own culpability in the disaster or their own war crimes, and concentrated on the loss, tragedy, and sorrow of losing so many Japanese sons.  This film, ""Twenty-Four Eyes,"" fits into that category...and for that reason has been so popular in Japan for fifty years.

As an example, when World War II looms, the boy students talk about becoming soldiers. Their teacher, Ms Oishe, responds that she prefers fishermen or rice sellers to soldiers. Later she is criticized gently for her ""lack of patriotism"" in her speech to the boys. To be fair, one aspect of anti-militarism ..the loss of freedom of speech...is well handled.

The story focuses on a self-sacrificing teacher and her relationship to 12 students over two decades. Everything is filmed around a small village bordering the ocean.  Over these many years, the female teacher forges strong emotional bonds with all her students...and so when the boys go to war...and some don't return, her deep, personal loss is as extreme as that of a parent. The themes are reinforced though the changing moods of the sea or of the folk songs which the school chants.  It's a very finely done film, although perhaps overly sentimental for my tastes. A great deal of attention is given to the serene, contemplative cinematography.

But...the director certainly never addresses the many injustices practiced by the Japanese on so many other Asian peoples.  It reminded me, in a way, of the Buddhist movie ""The Burmese Harp""...another excellent anti-war film that also sidesteps the issue of Japanese culpability.  Nevertheless, few films are so poignantly intimate in treating the loss of life in war as this Japanese study. It does this because it slowly acquaints the viewer with the daily lives of the twelve boys and girls - all adorable - who grow up with their teacher in the small, poor village on the sea. In other words, the memory of the soldiers...as children...is a very important perspective because what this film does, which no other movie does quite as well, is to depict war as The Death of Innocence.

3444604,5,B0019X400S,"I saw this movie around 1974 and was happy to find it in the Criterion Collection.  I was actually browsing the Criterion Collection film list, looking for another foreign film and saw this one.  So I bought it.

This movie was made in 1954 and tells the story of twelve school children from first grade in 1928, through 1946.

The story of how the movie was cast and made (told in the interview on the DVD) is almost as interesting as the movie itself.  Japan was a very poor country during that period, through the 1950s; the modern Japan we see began to bloom in the 1960s.  The story lines in the movie would be familiar to Japanese watching the movie in the 1950s, who had experienced the depression and World War II.

Overall, it is a really sad movie.  I love this movie.  You can see trailers and excerpts (in Japanese) on YouTube.

I was happy they kept it in black and white instead of adding color.",1426809600,2,909,4.357142857142857
3444605,5,B0019X400S,"This film was released in 1954, an excellent film that traces a teacher and her 12 students from the late 1920s to around 1950.  The story cleverly describes the pre WW-II, WW-II and post WW-II eras.  The film depicts the views of the teacher and her students during this time, portraying the hardships, censorship and sentiments expressed on the small Island of Shodoshima during this time.  The teacher was played by Hideko Takamine and her acting in this film is magnificent, I believe she did not have to act all that hard because the feelings expressed in the film were likely her own true feelings.  The movie is both joyous and sad, of the six boys in the class four do not return from the war, two return one of them blind, she losses her husband during the war and her young daughter dies in an accident after the war.  The film is also interesting to me for the following reasons; the first graders are my age (when the movie was made 1954) and I worked in Japan for a few years.  The Island of Sodoshima is located at the Northwest end of Shikkoku, Southeast of Osaka.",1422748800,,1079,4.451776649746193

3444609,5,B0019X400S,"This is a classic film of a lost Japan in transition. It's set in a little seaside town and tells the story of a young, modern teacher - she rides a bicycle - and her first dozen students. It follows her and that original class through the military coup in distant Tokyo and through the war. Needless to say, not all 24 eyes are still seeing by the end. Still, your sympathies are engaged, and between the wretched situation of women in pre-war Japan and the blind militarism of the men, there is sadness aplenty.

There's a fair bit of national self pity in this movie, but there is also a sense that Japan has to build something else if it is to move into the future. There's also the sense of a time and place lost as one finds in the movies of Pagnol, Disney or the recent Korean flick, My Mother, The Mermaid. It's an interesting counterpoint to a movie like Macarthur's Children or Sirota-Gordon's book, Only Woman in the Room.",1383350400,,933,4.393063583815029
3444610,5,B0019X400S,"TWENTY FOUR EYES directed by Keisuke Kinoshita & starring the well known Hideko Takamine of Carmen Comes Home & When a Woman Ascends the Stairs. The story is told through the lives of Oishi played by Takamine, a teacher extraordinarily devoted to the lives of 12 of her students from the 1920's in Japan through post-war Japan & her twelve students. She has a spirit that is quiet, gentle & devoted to life which did not play well through Japan's war with China & WWII. The pace of the movie matches her spirit perfectly as she faces the trials of her students growing up & facing the highly charged conversion of her profession & country to a modern war glorifying country.

The movie was made in 1954 & faced political obstacles as you may well imagine. When a Woman Ascends the Stairs made in 1960 is a really good companion piece to this since both portray a Japanese woman's troubles facing her country's societal pressure in totally different manners. Even though the ending is as you would expect, it is powerful & moving. 4.5 out of 5 stars for this one from Kinoshita.

If you are a fan of the rapid cuts used in movies today you'll never finish this one but if you love deeply detailed storylines & a fully developed character played by a sterling actress this is one for you. Since you may be wondering, I rate When a Woman Ascends the Stairs about .1 higher than Twenty Four Eyes but really there is little to choose from here. WAWATS is a bit faster paced & deals with a darker lifestyle. My personal preferences lean that way.",1377043200,2,1540,4.496428571428571
3444611,5,B0019X400S,"One should be very careful when one uses superlatives, but, `Twenty-Four Eyes' is one of the best movies ever made. Moreover, it is more than ever highly topical, albeit shot in black and white. It is the story of the emotional link between a junior teacher and her class of 12 children.

Keisuke Kinoshita's movie tackles directly such crucial issues as freedom of speech (if you speak out against the war, you could lose your job), as calling a spade a spade (a war means simply killing people), as the choice between war and peace, between love and hate, between care (for the children) and selfishness and between sincerity and deceit or worse denouncement. His movie makes one understand that there is an all powerful authority which intervenes behind the scene in people's lives, by manipulating public opinion and by trying to turn the population (and mostly its children and young men) into deaf-mute pawns in order to use them as cannon fodder. Another means is starving the dissidents by firing them.
Keisuke Kinoshita's characters are anchored in real life with its poverty (nothing to eat, or no money to go to school), its illnesses (tuberculosis), its accidents and, most importantly, the war and its victims.

Keisuke Kinoshita knows what true art is. It is not an expression of emotions, but the creation of emotions (involvement) into the spectator's heart.
His movie stands in sharp contrast with the actual avalanche of movie products pieced together with Meccano aliens (concocted with special effects) fighting human killers, while both are shouting their immoral gospel of violence and death. A truly cold world, and in no way the warm atmosphere created by Keisuke Kinoshita's school teacher.

`Twenty-Four Eyes' was shot by a director with a big heart, who made simply an everlasting sublime movie. A must see.",1374019200,6,1834,5.026315789473684
3444612,4,B0019X400S,"a touching and life affirming film, although i thought it could be better.  a case of too high expectation, but i would still recommend it",1362873600,,138,4.52
3444613,5,B0019X400S,"I absolutely adored this wonderful Japanese film, a genuine masterpiece which didn't age at all since 1954.

""Twenty-four eyes"" begins when in the 1920s a young and enthusiasthic teacher, sweet and beautiful Hisako Oishi (played magistrally by Hideko Takamine) arrives to a small, poor, backward and isolated village for her first job. She will meet quite a lot of difficulties, in the classroom and almost everywhere else, but ultimately all her pupils will worship her and people in the village will adopt her as one of their own. We will watch the children growing and their techer marry and become a mother, when in the same time observing a dark shadow of approaching war...

I will not describe anything else to avoid spoilers, but this film greatly impressed me - and at one moment, a particularly beautiful scene actually almost made me cry. Watching all those children grow, when knowing that some will be snatched from life too young by the wars awaged by Japan between 1937 and 1945 was by moments heartbreaking. On another hand, this film, although frequently very sad, is never nihilistic or cynical - much to the contrary, it is a song to the beauty of life and love and their ultimate triumph over death. There is also some humor very delicately inserted, with my absolute favourite being the three gossiping women from the village seizing EVERY occasion to get together and ""process data""...)))

At 156 minutes it is a long film, but I didn't feel the time pass - I was seduced and fascinated, from the beginning to the end. The performance of all the actors, inluding the very young ones, is simply spotless. The director controlled this film masterfully for every and each second. The scenario is very strong. Visually this film is also spectacularly good, which is an achievement for a black and white movie. And of course there is the great music.

3444615,5,B0019X400S,"I first saw this film in my early 20's. The local PBS station in Tucson, Arizona was showing classic foreign films on Friday nights. After 15 or 20 minutes I was hooked. At that time this was not the kind of film I was going out of my way to see, being a guy who loved westerns, historical epics and science fiction and horror films. In 1928 a new teacher arrives in a small town on a Japanese island where she has 12 students, The film follows her life and her student's lives over the next 20 plus years. It's sometimes tragic sometimes happy but always incredibly moving. The film also depicts the war years and the censorship and militarism that the teacher has to contend with and it is a very down beat depiction. I showed this film several years ago to my best friend who is a retired teacher. He was also very moved as I had been when I first saw it. What surprised him was that the teacher in the film faced many of the same problems he faced such as the problems he had with school administrators, parents and school policies, and also that some of the school children were similar to students he had had even though this film was made in another country, another culture and was made 58 years ago. This film shows that most people are in many ways basically alike.

The Criterion edition is fantastic and the subtitles are great. This film has my highest recommendation.",1339632000,12,1381,4.39453125
3444616,5,B0019X400S,"This is a movie about life, war, and poverty... It contains no battle scenes, but  illustrates the war through its effects on the pupils of one teacher over 20 years.  The movie occasionally refers to the political situation and to the militarization of society, but rather that pound one over the head with  details, it makes its point indirectly.  And that indirectness is the strength of this movie.  Similarly, poverty is illustrated by its effects on the pupils..when their parents go bankrupt, and need them to leave school and work to support their families.  The movie is about effects rather than causes. Although there a lot of emotional moments, the movie is almost scientific in the way it assembles the evidence against  war, militarism, and dictatorship as well as the effects of poverty.",1336435200,,802,4.984962406015038

The story centers around the students and teacher at a small school in a remote Japanese coastal town.  The viewer watches as the story progresses and the children grow and pursue their futures.  The film begins with the years before WW2 and continues into the years afterwards.

This is a touching story, and one that is well told.  The actors are very good, especially surprising since many are children.  The settings are very beautiful and only add to the overall evocative feeling of the film.  I highly recommend this film, it is surely among the best ever filmed in Japan.",1316908800,2,709,4.366412213740458
3444618,5,B0019X400S,"This is one of the best movies of all time. I don't know what the film academics have to say about it, but in my view it rivals anything Kurosawa ever did. But even that does not say it. It is as good if not better than anything in American cinema to date. I'm not kidding. It's that good.",1244505600,6,289,3.9152542372881354
3444619,4,B0019X400S,"The director takes a long lens to a small place and produces a very big film. A class of primary school children on an island in the Inland Sea receives a new teacher in 1928. Over the next twenty years of economic depression, world war and costly peace, we see the relationships begun that day trailing in a dozen directions, like streamers in the wind, held together by a woman who struggles, learns and suffers along with them. This is not epic film-making, but it is powerful and often very beautiful. Even in black and white, the scene in which the young teacher leads her pupils weaving and singing through a grove of sakura in bloom (she is the locomotive to their carriages) is quite unforgettable.

The film's ambitions, however, are at the root of its weaknesses as a creative statement. Kinoshita takes the story to places beyond the scope of its ideas and sentimental style. In a sense, he loses control of the narrative, and this is felt most keenly during the last 20 minutes, as he wrestles with a resolution.

Kinoshita gives his main character a political awakening - invites questions from the audience - but fails to go anywhere with it. The events that wash up onto the teacher's small island and carry away the lives of her former pupils - injustice, depression and war - are like night-mists that come and go, withering the crop, yet never seen. The one, overt, hostile act of authority - police interrogating a teacher for having a ""subversive"" magazine - is talked about but not shown. The sole authority figure in the story, her headmaster, is a genial ""uncle"". How is it, then, that children are dying of preventable diseases and being sold into servitude at the age of 12 or 13; how is that innocent folk songs have been replaced by patriotic military chants; how come the graveyard is now filled with would-be fishermen and farmers-turned-soldiers? What political agency was responsible?

The film's medium is tears, not political discourse, but it is too good a film not to be concerned with the larger questions. In the case of the main character, we are left with little more in the way of an answer than her off-repeated mantra, ""nobody's fault"" - a phrase, incidentally, that Charles Dickens used in ""Little Dorrit"" to satirise the complacency of his age. Kinoshita is anything but a satirist.  Though we should not wish a film to be something it does not aspire to be, there are themes incipient in this work which deserved a braver treatment.

Takamine Hideko, a great actress, is quite wonderful as the sympathetic teacher.",1240876800,4,2559,4.754504504504505
3444620,5,B0019X400S,"I didn't quite know what to expect from this film ... but as the last of its 156 minutes played, I wished it could have been even longer, although that would have meant a few more lumps in the throat & teary-eyed moments. It's a deeply moving film, and its sentimental scenes are truly earned & not the least bit gratuitous or pandering.

The story: a young woman begins her first teaching job on a small island village in Japan, with 12 students in her first grade class (hence the 24 eyes of the title). This opening sequence is charming & gentle, with the worst of the children's problems & woes easily mended with a few kind words & an understanding heart.

But as the children grow older, remaining in touch with their beloved teacher over the years, the harsher aspects of life begin to take their toll. First the Great Depression, then the rise of Japanese militarism -- and the teacher can only watch, sick at heart, as promising futures are dashed & redirected by family & social pressures.

While set in Japan during a specific period of history, the themes are timeless & universal, sad to say. When Japan continues its buildup to the Second World War, the patriotic songs & marches seem all too familiar -- as do the warnings from higher-ups in the school system that their job is to create obedient, patriotic citizens, willing to serve the state without question. It's made clear to our troubled teacher that any mention of other, antiwar possibilities are strictly forbidden, lest she be accused of being ""a Red.""

Yet she does what she can, telling her male students that she'd be just as proud of them for becoming farmers or clerks or rice merchants, rather than becoming soldiers. The boys, of course, are caught up in shining visions of military glory & honor, without the slightest notion of the dark & bloody reality behind them.

At the same time, she also struggles to help her female students become more than what family & society have prepared them to be ... not always successfully. Why does she struggle against such hopeless odds? Not so much for political or ideological reasons, but because of her individual compassion & spirit. These struggles even go on within her own family, as her husband is drafted & her own young sons dream of becoming soldiers themselves.

Covering nearly 20 years, the film has an elegiac tone, a sense of memories washing up over & over again upon the same shore which opens & closes the film. Hideko Takamine is superb as the teacher, nicknamed ""Miss Pebble"" by her students, changing over the years from the fresh-faced young woman who appears in Western clothes, riding a bicycle through the shocked village, to the middle-aged woman both wounded & tempered by loss & grief, still refusing to surrender to despair.

156 minutes may sound daunting, but don't let that stop you from watching this richly rewarding film. Most highly recommended!",1240272000,35,2906,4.742574257425742

Rating = ***
Director:  Keisuke Kinoshita
Producer:  Rytar Kuwata
DVD
1954

Film = three (3) stars; editing = 2.5 stars; restoration = 2.5 stars.  Director Keisuke Kinoshita's lyrical outing suffers from an attempt to blend epoch drama with an all-purpose (Swiss-army- knife) children's choral concert.  The mash up is quite effective when the Director sticks with cute first-grade school songs.  Not so much when his children's  chorus sings lyrics that: consist of blank-verse nonsense (a phenomenon often found on the sound track of films from this era); take on an unrealistic adult perspective; provide expository information (voice-over singing); deliver travel logs; provide third-party points of view; etc. In short, this incessant ""racket"" rapidly becomes an irritant especially when it keeps interrupting the very engaging story line. The film needs a good scrub by an experienced musical director (which would also shorten a too long film and keep the focus squarely on the unfolding high drama).  It is amusing to see that school classes seem to be limited to--you guessed it--singing!  No less interesting is the lack of continuity when 12 first-grade children (24 eyes) suddenly become 20 or more (yonjuu no hitomi!).  Kinoshita makes effective use of very long scenes by ensuring they remain engaging.  Acting, however, is uneven due to limitations in script and direction.  The talents of leading actress Hideko Takamine (playing a ""modern"" school teacher) are squandered with dialog along the lines of ""I don't know what to say"" and ""I can't say anything now"" and ever present sobbing (more than half of Takamine's performance is limited to crying!).  Distinguished actor Chish Ry is both miscast and misdirected playing a clueless first-grade music teacher.  Director Kinoshita also over doses on cute (but hammy and obviously staged) mug shots of children (the same shots are repeatedly shown).  Subtitles do not translate hand writing and some singing bouts.  Cinematography (narrow screen, black and white) uses an antique format (perhaps due to budging issues and/or fear of updating?).  Editing errors and restoration that does not correct for same occur with each inter-scene dissolve in the first third of the movie.  Linked scenes go out of focus just before and immediately after each dissolve (could at least be replaced with jump cuts during restoration?).  Sound dubbing is OK.  Nonchoral music consists of a rich score that include some riffs on Steven Foster and Auld Lang Syne.  Subtitles do not translate hand writing and some singing bouts.  Enjoyable, especially if you are into choral music big time!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1463184000,,2746,5.330232558139535
