3466862,5,B00005JXZZ,"The Tomorrow Man is much more than just a simple Sci-Fi Time Travel movie.  It is a study of gross human sin (Man's inhumanity toward man) and ultimately one man's repentance via the use of Time Travel.

Corbin Bernsen does an outstanding job of portraying a rock solid man of integrity with a heart of gold but lacking the ability to relate to and understand others.  I ended up both loving and hating this character, as well as thoroughly identifying with him, which is why I loved this movie.  Excellent job Mr. Corbin Bernsen, that's why you're one of my favorite actors, and a darn fine Q if I do say so.  The movie ends in such a way as to spread love and joy to the entire world.

I stand up and applaud this fine film while thanking God for such a finely made movie.  Thanks God!  (Spoken while pointing both index fingers toward the Heavens!)",1218931200,5,851,4.375796178343949

3466864,2,B00005JXZZ,"Potentially interesting plot gets completely lost amid constant chases and bang bang shoot-outs, that reduce this to what amounts to just another boring guns, cars, and chases movie with a slight time-travel thing thrown in for the sci-fi addicts.

And do films ALWAYS have to end with the two protaganists meeting for the final cliffhanging (yawn..) confrontation?

Wake me up someone....",1145664000,8,389,5.360655737704918
3466865,5,B00005JXZZ,"THE TOMORROW MAN breaks all the preconceived notions on time travel, the continuum, etc.  In this movie, we find an agency that plans to use time travel to change crucial mistakes of the past, (e.g., Hitler, Watergate, etc.), without any resulting changes in what those alterations could bring.  One of the characters even says so, that all that time travel bullcrap is just that.
Anyway, with this clarified, I found TOMORROW MAN a wonderfully entertaining and involving movie.  Corbin Bernsen stars as Max Klein, a typical macho father, who believes his young son should be raised just as he was.  In other words, spare the rod and you have a wimpy child.  Bernsen is thrown into the maelstrom of time travel when his son from thirty years in the future, returns and kidnaps himself to save himself from his father's future abuse.  Cop Beth Kennedy in a wonderfully self-parodying performance enlists Bernsen's help to catch his son, as he is now a kidnaper, murderer, bank robber, etc.  Morgan Rusler plays the Brian of the future, and he is one of the strangest looking actors I've seen, and not altogether a good actor, but his unique physical appearance (kind of a human Dopey) does manage to evoke a little sympathy, although his actions in the end of the film justify the need to get rid of him.  Jeanne Cooper (Bernsen's real-life mama) plays his wife in the future, and she does an admirable job in conveying the hurt she experienced while dealing with the abusive Bernsen.
What makes the movie work is Bernsen's duplicity; Kennedy's off color remarks; Cooper's ability to play a role her own age, unglamorous, and the writer's desire to give Bernsen's character a second chance.
It's low budget all the way, but it also has a heart, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it made me feel.
Not a classic, but worth the time.",1088726400,46,1838,4.739811912225705
3466866,5,B00005JXZZ,"The topic of time travel and one's ability to use it to change the past (and, therefore, the future) is always fascinating.  I personally like the idea that, as they say in The Terminator series, ""the future is not set.""  While Corbin Bersen's acting may not be top of the line, he's actually not the main character and does a reasonable job as a father whose son has been kidnapped.  I can't say much more about the storyline without giving it away except, of course, that it has a happy ending.  This movie is in no ways hard SF, and those looking for it will not like the movie.  But for those looking for an interesting thought and a ""feel-good"" movie, this it is.",1067385600,42,668,4.354838709677419
3466867,5,B00005JXZZ,"Great combination of action, drama and comedy.  Very FUN movie with an interesting plot. I just loved it from beginning to end.  Wonderful acting too! I laughed....I cryed...what more do you want?",1006560000,2,196,5.09375
8279465,3,B00005JXZZ,"Larry (Corbin Bernsen) has a blue-collar attitude on life. Unfortunately, life goes wrong and he has trouble coping. Can his future son appear to help him see the evil of his ways?

This is actually a movie about a dysfunctional family learning to become functional; it just happens to be using time travel is a framework for this what if movie.

I don't want to discourage you as the movie is action-packed and full of drama. The reason the time travel works in this movie is because they described it as how time travel really works not all these old-fashioned theories.",1494201600,,572,4.653465346534653
8279466,4,B00005JXZZ,"This is a time travel movie, but it avoids a deeply philosophical or scientific approach to the topic in favor of an engaging ""what if"" story.

The main character, the father of the villain, is bullied at work, and he is committed to ensuring that his son stands up to bullying in his own life.  As the story goes though, the dad tries a bit too hard.

We know this, because his son is a felon from the future that comes back to kidnap himself and ensure that he has some fun growing up.

The dad is a brilliant character, because he does some of the wrong things for the right reasons.

There is also a female cop from the future who sees the villain shoot her fiancee in their own home.  She is torn between abiding by the law and killing the jerk.

All in all, a very entertaining movie.",1434585600,,790,4.19205298013245

8279472,4,B00005JXZZ,"This made-for-TV film is not a Hollywood big-budget production.  Technically, I think that means there's no CGI, no green-screen special effects, no car crashes or explosions, a limited soundtrack budget. Not even a big costume budget.  That what this film is not.  What it is ... is captivating.  [...] says 'if you enjoyed this, see Gattaca', and I agree.  Both build the story well, and draw you in.
