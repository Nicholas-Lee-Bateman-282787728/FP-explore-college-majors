8331907,3,6302999340,"The overall content of this tape is very good, and contains a lot of top water action. At one point I thought it could be an infomercial  for Strike King lures. The tape was loaded with static so I had to rate it 2.0",1394755200,,216,3.909090909090909
8331908,4,6302999340,These three episodes go into detail with how bass hear. How bass smell their prey. How barometric pressure effects a basses behavior. Rating; 3.5 with slight static interference.,1394755200,,178,5.392857142857143
8331909,3,6302999340,Bill Dance was at the top of his game with these three for instruction and entertainment. Unfortunatly there was a problem with one of the three so I just replaced it and kept going. The best is at AMAZON any way so no need to fuss about it.,1394236800,,241,4.041666666666667
8331910,4,6302999340,"This 1995 tape from STRIKE KING PRODUCTIONS is possibly the first ,for it's time to explain what strutcure really is before all the high tech eletronics we have available now. This is some valuable instruction that shouldn't be passed up.",1394236800,,238,4.975
8331911,4,6302999340,"This tape is 60 minutes of some of the best instruction for it's time.(1993).For me it was very entertaining, and I RECOMEND ANY OF THE Bill Dance series for the entertainment value alone.",1394236800,,188,4.7272727272727275
8331912,3,6302999340,Nothing great. Just a bunch of regular garbage with ol Bill Dance yanking in bass. Has a couple tips that you already know.,1318982400,,123,4.391304347826087
