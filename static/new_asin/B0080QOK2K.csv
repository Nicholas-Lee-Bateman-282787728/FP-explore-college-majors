5116725,3,B0080QOK2K,"Raquel Welch heats up the screen in a big way in this 1969 action-thriller. After starring with Frank Sinatra in ""Lady In Cement""(1968), which was Sinatra's sequel to ""Tony Rome""(1967), and before starring in 1970's trio of ""Fathom"", ""The Magic Christian"", & ""Myra Breckinridge"", Raquel squeezed in this melodrama in which she plays the role of a Go-Go dancer who gets stalked by a homicidal maniac who blames her for the breakup of his marriage. After the character played by Luke Askew guns down his estranged wife, he then goes gunning for Raquel. The action shifts from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, where Raquel is helped by James Stacy, who plays her new friend who quickly becomes her possible love-interest.  The film moves along quite well except for the scenes with Stacy who is intent on both protecting Welch, as well as courting her. Naturally, with a killer on her trail, as well as having some ""daddy-issues"" hindering her relationship with Stacy, the plot does tend to get bogged down. Actually, in terms of credibility, there are some plot holes that could fill The Grand Canyon. The film does provide some nice eye-candy between Welch and some of the other Go-Go dancers and the location filming of several night spots in both Las Vegas and L.A. is easy on the eyes. When Welch shifts to L.A., she works at a strip-club named ""Losers"". One of the signs on the club signs reads ""Topless-Bottomless and LSD Shows"". So the film dates itself but film lovers of 60's will actually enjoy the film even more because of this. For all of those viewers, add another star to make it 4. Actually, for sheer entertainment without too much thought, Raquel, the look of the film, and the pace of the action scenes will satisfy. As expected, Raquel is very nice to view in her Go-Go outfit. The running time of the film is 100 minutes, it is in Widescreen, and the digital transfer is close to pristine. RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!!",1364256000,5,1921,4.717261904761905
5116726,4,B0080QOK2K,"The faux Maurice Binder-like opening title sequence should cue you in on what to expect with ""Flareup"".  If that doesn't do it Les Baxter's theme music by way of Mike Curb should do the trick.  This is a Lifetime movie if it were conceived by Austin Powers.  Star Raquel Welch seems pretty clueless in her one-note readings.  It's as though she's working on a Sports Illustrated swimsuit spread instead of a dramatic venture.  Strange as well is some of Welch's nameless co-stars appear topless while she has one dance sequence in a low-cut leotard.  Luke Askew does get the film's camp potential doing his best Dennis Hopper playing a deranged killer.  It's without irony that Askew appeared in ""Easy Rider"" with Hopper the same year this film was released.  Welch's love interest played by James Stacy is kind of reminiscent of Alec Baldwin.  ""Flareup"" isn't a great film but if you are looking for some unintended hoots this is the flick for you.",1361059200,5,949,4.773006134969325

5116728,3,B0080QOK2K,"Memories of '69 with Raquel. This is the kind of cool cinema trash that's hard not to enjoy. Raquel gives Ann-Margret a run for her money as a graduate of the Pussycat School of Acting. There's a priceless bit when a gas-station attendant asks Raquel if she works at a nearby hospital and she says: ""Yes, I'm a brain surgeon!"". You definitely get what you pay for with FLARE UP - and there's music by Les Baxter, too!",1340841600,11,417,4.358974358974359
5116729,4,B0080QOK2K,"[FLAREUP - (1969) - Widescreen - directed by James Neilson] Finally released on DVD, this film is mandatory viewing for Raquel Welch fans and 60's film lovers, all else should approach with caution. I say this because the first act is solid; the second drags itself down in relationship development between Raquel and James Stacy that poorly subs for storyline improvement, creating a lull in the events until the third act kicks in and delivers an incendiary finale. But the same could be said for a great deal of films from that time period.

The highlight (for me as a fan) were the nightclub scenes - at one point (unfortunately, only one) Raquel hits the stage in a jaw-dropping outfit dancing and strutting about proving what a fixating, fetching and intoxicating femme she was at her core - undoubtedly the flick's piece de resistance for those who think like me. (It's worth sitting through all those Bob Hope salutes to the troops in 'Nam just to see the likes of Raquel, Joey Heatherton, Ann Margret and Lola Falana prance and preen as goodwill ambassadors to boost our boys morale - it does a heart good, not to mention the nethers, to see such rousing members, I mean numbers. But I digress...).

The film has its strong moments but loses focus often enough to remain completely coherent, the plot needed additional development, and the probable outcome was no stretch to any imagination (the killer never gets away, not then, not now), but the finale with homicidal Luke Askew was a decent one, and one that was violently brazen back then. By today's standards, it's tepid for sure, but not for the mainstream sixties boxoffice PG rating.

Raquel is in fine form, and it's great to see so much of Las Vegas and Hollywood locales as they were back then, so nostalgia and sightseeing are keywords to those who would find this film enjoyable. I enjoyed it for what it was, knowing it wasn't going to be a Vegas killer 'Ben Hur' and comforted knowing it wasn't 'Myra Breckenridge' either. I believe I entered puberty watching Raquel in 'Fathom' a few years earlier, so I have a genetic weakness for her 'body' of work - keep this in mind.

Warner Archives delivers a solid widescreen print without remastering; colors rich, contrast deep, audio crisp and clear. A 3 star film elevated to 4 due to the enchanting beauty of that 60's icon among icons, the breathtaking Miss Welch.",1340150400,22,2387,4.730769230769231

5116739,3,B0080QOK2K,"In my high school years, I was a big Raquel Welch fan and here is a title that I missed when it was first released which alluded me until now.  Warner Archive has released Director James Neilson's 'FLAREUP'-1969, a missed opportunity bogged down by a lame script by television series scribe, Marc Rodgers.  If the beginning did not contain topless scenes of girls go-go dancing, it resembles the assembly line Movie of the Week television excursions that flooded the home screens at that time and TV director Neilson treats the material in that fashion.  Witnessing her girl friend gunned down by spurned ex-husband Luke Askew in a scene stealing performance, she becomes his next target which causes her to go on the run.  The film should have escalated into a 'RUN LOLA RUN' type actioner but it slowly plummets into a soapy affair as Raquel finds herself falling for night club owner James Stacy.  It takes over 95 minutes for Askew to catch up with Raquel for the supposed nail biting climax but by then, nobody cares.  Raquel is excellent in the lead showing what an underrated actress she truly was.  Her career would take a slight slump following this film with Director Joseph McGrath's 'THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN'-1969 and Director Michael Sarne's silly mess 'MYRA BRECKINRIDGE'-1970.  Actor James Stacy known for his television work including his series 'LANCER'-1968-1970 can't seem to carry the leading man spot causing Raquel to shine on her own.  Character actor Luke Askew was a pro at playing psycho roles and this one is no exception.  He would go on to make the cult Spaghetti Western , Director Guilio Petroni's 'NIGHT OF THE SERPENT' aka 'LA NOTTE DEI SERPENTI' and available from Wild East Productions as 'NEST OF VIPERS' the same year.  There is a nice cameo by actress Jean Byron (billed as Jeane) as a go-go club owner. With straight on photography by Andrew J. McIntyre and music by AIP stalwart Les Baxter, it emerges as a routine thriller at best recommended for hard core Raquel fans only (you know who you are).  Warner Archive releases it in a nice 1.85 DVD-R transfer with an original trailer pushing Raquel as the world's most wanted woman as its only extra.",1377475200,6,2184,4.810160427807487
