3700572,4,B001MVWMIY,I enjoyed this movie its light and fluffy but the dance scene is one of my all time fav's as its so hot. The  music used in backing is abit full on at times. The bonuses are really good.,1276992000,,186,3.769230769230769

I highly recommend it.",1244851200,,94,3.8947368421052633
3700576,5,B001MVWMIY,"This movie is hilarious and very sweet.  You love all the characters but at the same time think, ""For crying out loud.  What's with these people?"" The premise of being outed at your sister's wedding (when you're straight) sounds over the top, but is made entirely believable by the situational comedy.  Loved it. Be sure to watch the special features.",1244678400,4,351,4.816666666666666
3700577,5,B001MVWMIY,How many times can a simple misunderstanding screw up your life. Well maybe its not so simple....... I really enjoy watching this movie.,1244419200,2,136,4.956521739130435
3700578,4,B001MVWMIY,"Overall, I liked this movie.  It had weak moments, but the acting was good, the dialogue right on the money, and there was a lot of comedy to keep it fun.

A comedy of errors, this story is silly and light, but it also had its touching moments, and a happy ending.  And I have to say the gay best friend was really adorable.",1235347200,3,324,4.03125
3700579,5,B001MVWMIY,"I finally got to see this and it was worth the wait. It may be an indie but it has a lot of heart, and reminds me of the screwball comedies of old Hollywood, only gayer. Alex is mistakenly outed as a lesbian at her sisters wedding, and what starts as a misunderstanding soon morphes into a pretend lesbian relationship and a lot of funny gags and romantic surprises.

Defintely worth watching, and so much better than director Lee Friedlander's other movie Girl Play. The lead actresses, though mostly unknown, bring great chemistry and charm to Alex, Jeannie and Risa. This is what a gay comedy should be, funny without being cliched.",1225843200,9,635,4.669642857142857

3700620,4,B001MVWMIY,"I love this movie because it makes you just want to laugh out loud. Two sisters always in competiton with each other and always trying to out do the other.

3700624,5,B001MVWMIY,"This is a fuuuuunnnyyyyyy movie!  I laughed hysterically for an hour and a half.  You just HAVE to see this film!!!!  How the director managed to make a great lesbian drama while focusing on a straight relationship is BRILLIANT!

I have to give credit to Cathy DeBuono for selling this movie.  I don't think that any other lesbian actress that I've seen could have pulled off this role as well.  She is so adorable.  She somehow manages humorous and intensely serious at the same time.

Desi Lydic, who plays Jeannie, also has a marvelous performance.  She is delightfully cute in this movie!

Granted, some parts of the movie were awkward and really contributed nothing to it . . . .  I just fast forward through those parts!

Oh, and the chemistry (Between whom, you ask.  Well, buy it and find out.) is AMAZING.",1398038400,2,814,4.608391608391608

Smart, funny, and beautifully made, Out At The Wedding explores the sometimes comically bumbling way in which we come out to the people we love-whether gay or straight.",1391644800,,419,5.161764705882353
3700629,5,B001MVWMIY,"After a bit of a slow start,wasn't sure if I was going to stick it out, but was totally worth it. Funny movie once it got going. Lots of laugh out loud lines. totally recommend it",1388361600,,179,4.0

3700656,4,B001MVWMIY,"This is a truly sweet and cute movie. Although often tagged as a lesbian movie, this isn't just a movie about lesbians or for lesbians. The main character, Alex, played by Andrea Marcellus is a young woman on her way to her sister Jeannie's, played by Desi Lydic, wedding. Her secret is that her boyfriend is Jewish-African-American, and she is afraid her ""bigoted,"" Southern family won't understand. Through a series of bumbling misinformation, her family somehow comes to the conclusion that she is a lesbian. Cue the Lesbian-For-Hire Risa played by Cathy DeBuono.

When her family, including her newly married sister, decides to visit, she hires a lesbian (Risa) to play her girlfriend in an attempt to keep her family from knowing the truth. Much hilarity, lying, and painful honesty ensues as the characters try to navigate falling in love. This movie doesn't end quite like one would assume, as the ""twist"" has a lot to say about racial and gay stereotypes.

All-in-all this is a cute and sweet movie about falling in love and learning to be true to yourself no matter the cost.

This movie has a truly awesome sound track, and one of the highlights is the dance scene Cathy DeBuono and Desi Lydic to Beth Hart's ""Leave the Light On.""

************************* VERY TINY SPOILER ALERT**************************************

This movie has a happy ending for all the concerned lesbians out there.",1353456000,17,1402,5.025862068965517
3700657,3,B001MVWMIY,"I gave this movie three stars. It's a funny, light romantic comedy. It's not a great film, but it's cute and lighthearted. The premise is a little different than most lesbian movies. In this one, a straight woman who moved to New York from a small southern town doesn't want to tell her family that her boyfriend is black. Through a series of highly improbable events, everyone in her family thinks she's gay, and her boyfriend is really a woman. So rather than admit the truth when her sister comes for a visit, she ""hires"" a lesbian, played by Cathy DeBuono, to be her fake girlfriend. That's the set up. The humor flows from that. Naturally, she has a gay best friend, with all the obligatory gay jokes. The twist (which I won't spoil for you) is what makes this movie work, and it has to do with stereotypes.",1351036800,4,812,4.456375838926174
3700658,5,B001MVWMIY,"I really liked this film, not because it was great art or because it had some hidden meaning, but because it was very well acted, well joined together and had some very nice, sweet scenes. Cathy DeBuono's hands are worth watching, they are gorgeous.  Funny, witty, cool, .... watch it.",1326499200,,285,4.7
