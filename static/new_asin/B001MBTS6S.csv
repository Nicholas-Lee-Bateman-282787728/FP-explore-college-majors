8320945,4,B001MBTS6S,"There are some classic episodes of PMR on here; in particular the Rat-infested AMC Pacer story, and the ""Grifted by Grandma"" Buick Century that gets turned into an old-school hot rod. (There are also two episodes from this season where it was revealed on a ""Where Are They Now?"" Special [not available on any DVD], that two of these freshly pimped cars were totaled soon after completion, giving those shows an interesting vibe when watched with wiser eyes).  This is also the last season at West Coast Customs, which I personally prefer to the later episodes at GAS, which were more silly than technical.

My only major beef is that this season is short--only eight episodes compared to the others, which have 12-18 per season, yet Season Three retails for the same amount.",1339891200,,774,4.81203007518797
8320946,5,B001MBTS6S,"This is like Oprah for men.  Poor bastards who are days away from an accident have the singer/actor Exhibit show up like like an angel and save your life by turning your main means of transportation from a moving bomb to a piece of artwork. This show have given birth to so many shows where normal people are saved or helped by artists with power.  It is uplifting and powerful.  Exihibit's music on the other hand is also quite powerful but if you are looking for the happy saved by an angel stuff, his tunes are not it.  I started listening to his music after seeing the show and I can't stop.  He is an artist that can find the dark parts of life as skillfully as the light.  To date my favorite song is ""Heart of Man"" on the Man vs. Machine CD.  See this show, help people in need and buy his CDs!!!",1287360000,,803,4.141935483870967
8320947,4,B001MBTS6S,This is always a great show it is amazing how they can transform a piece of junk vehicle into a work of art.  The only bad thing about season three is that it is a lot shorter than the other seasons.  In the others they work on 16 or 17 vehicles but in this season only 8.,1269993600,,272,3.754385964912281
