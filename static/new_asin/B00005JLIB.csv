1459284,5,B00005JLIB,"I received this DVD on Oct 18th which I was really surprised about considering it isn't supposed to be released for another 11 days. Anyway I excitedly tore open the wrapping and started watching. WOW how cool is this show, it's weird seeing the first series again, how much everybody has changed compared to the latest series which is about half way though here in England even though it was made in 1999!!!
The series starts off with Paul and Jamie only being married for a few months, and so the fun starts especially for the kitchen table!! The series introduces all of the main characters and you start to see some of the quirks in them that make latter series even funnier. This is truely the greatest show ever created, it's the type of show that makes you feel good and you can watch it over and over without the jokes getting old.
I can't really single out my favourite episode there all amazing, but the episode that takes us back to when Paul and Jamie first met is certainly one of the best.
What I have to say about the DVD is it's nice to have the entire series sold together for an exceptible price, unlike other series like Friends that are sold for 2 or 3 times as much. One of the only dissappointing things about the DVD is that there are no special features, the other is that I think the episode order is wrong because the last episode on the DVD is ""The Painter"", where as I thought the series finale was ""Wedding Anniversary"". Please if anybody finds this on their DVD or I am wrong about the series finale email me and tell me, because it is annoying me.
This is an amazing first series to a sitcom that shows how life should be, and hopefully we won't have to wait long for the other series.",1035158400,14,1716,4.332298136645963
1459285,5,B00005JLIB,"This is one of the classic series of all time.  There is everything about being a couple in this series, a modern couple of the '90s that is.  Jamie and Paul are the couple, the New York city typical, or sometimes not-so-typical, couple that everything revolves around.  And then there's Murray the dog, their dear companion through the whole series.  There's also Fran and Mark, also a married couple that they can pal around with.  Lisa, Jamie's ditzy sister jumps in and out at the most inexpected moments.  And let's not forget Paul's parents, oh yes, the in-laws, they're always there in some form.  It all makes for some interesting and unusual moments that we can all relate and laugh and cry to.  This is so wonderful to have on DVD now, I can throw away some of those poorly abused VCR tapes.  It'll be a joy to relive the Buchman's all over again!",1034726400,6,857,4.512987012987013
1459286,3,B00005JLIB,"The first season is much more about Paul than it is about Paul and Jamie. The series started out as the story of a man who falls in love and is struggling to give up being a bachelor in favor of the romantic relationship.  It was not until the third season that the show began to take shape into what it is best known as: one of the greatest romantic comedy series TV has ever seen.
The first season features Selby, Paul's bachelor friend who constantly tempts Paul's wild side.  His character does nothing for the series and was dropped after this first season. I remember seeing first-season episodes only when the show was first syndicated, and it seems they've since been taken out of rotation.
Buy this if you love the show and want to see subsequent seasons on DVD.  But be prepared: this is not the show as you came to love it during its last 5 seasons.",1034726400,26,860,4.3625
1459287,5,B00005JLIB,"I don't need to wait until this DVD hits store shelves. I've seen every episode here numerous times and can promise you this will be a great buy! We're introduced to all the major characters, but more important, we get to see how great the chemistry was between Paul and Helen. It's great to see this season progress as the show finds its stride. I can only hope they will eventually release all 7 seasons of this greatest of romantic sitcoms. Buy it! For yourself and for your friends.",1030665600,6,486,4.47191011235955
1459288,5,B00005JLIB,"When Seinfeld was dominating the world of Sitcoms few TV shows could look good in comparison... This was one of the exceptions to the rule. Mad about you was EVERYTHING a series should be and more, Funny, Smart and very romantic. It had something for everyone. With Paul Reisers very funny witt and the talents of Helen Hunt this was and will always be a great show! Check out the dvd for a guarenteed laugh.",1029974400,6,408,4.453333333333333
1459289,5,B00005JLIB,"This show is awesome. Deffinatly the best work of Helen Hunt & Paul Reiser. The chemistry so real & acting so believable. Watching this show is like being a fly on the wall of the Buchman living room (or what ever room they happen to be occupying) You just can't help but to laugh & in many cases relate to the scenes & situations. I can't wait for the DVD to be released. I am anxious to see the extras features that will hopefully be included. ...
AWESOME DVD EXTRAS that would make the MAY DVD the best sitcom DVD of all time would be to add the additional features of: interviews of the individual cast members, bloopers, biographies, TV appearances or commercials promoting the show, an alternate POP UP viewing version (like directors commentary but with pop up bubbles with fun, interesting & sometimes off the wall info pertaining to the show or something in the scene)even hidden easter eggs such as the OPRAH baby shower on the 5th season DVD or special messages from the actors themselves. It would also be nice to have behind the scenes features showing the filming of MAY (as an easter egg).
But thats Just my opinion :)",1027641600,3,1133,4.53170731707317

1459291,5,B00005JLIB,"It simply must.  I don't care what else is on television, if there is a rerun of Mad About You on, it takes priority.  It is simply the finest, most delightfully subtle, witty, profound, well-crafted piece of television history I have ever experienced.  The DVDs would be worth it for the opening and closing tags alone, the show was THAT funny.
And yet, the show was more than a sit com.  There was more to these characters than a laugh track.  Paul and Jamie, and all their friends, went through all kinds of life crises and issues - all presented credibly with honest emotional resonance.  I cannot watch the sequence of episodes at the end of Season 4 where Paul and Jamie nearly break up without tears streaming down my face.  Because these people are REAL.
Helen Hunt deserved her Emmys, and Paul Reiser got shafted so many times in that department. (It is unfathomable to me that Kelsey Grammer is considered more talented - go figure!)
This show is a must for any fan of 90's comedy.  The show had heart and is so very quotable as to endear it to you for years to come!  Please give us DVDs with lots of commentary from the cast so we can cherish this masterpiece forever!",1026691200,,1180,4.4511627906976745

1459539,3,B00005JLIB,"I am a huge fan of the series, I was a teenager when it was originally aired. When I saw the DVDs, I immediately thought ""It's a must have!"".
The packaging is OK, it's a neat glossy cardboard sleeve from where you take a glossy cardboard / plastic booklet style box.
The leaflet only has an episode list, no review, no comments, nothing extra.
It has no extras whatsoever, just the series. I was expecting some ""Director's / writer's / actor's comments"" or maybe some outtakes.
It is standard DVD quality, if your viewing device has nice upscaling it looks great.
It could have more subtitle languages options (it only has English).

1459702,5,B00005JLIB,"Seinfeld is often lauded as THE sitcom of its time. I beg to differ. MAD ABOUT YOU has a smart touch without being smart-aleck. It also has some absolutely perfect scripts that are comedy classics -- as well as some amazing performances by comic greats like Sid Ceasar. The show never loses respect for the people who inhabit it. Quirky characters? Vain? Silly? Absurd? Yes to all that. But the characters also have an intelligence and a moral center that I find missing in Seinfeld. Actually, I think Seinfeld (both the man and his show) has helped to increase the rudeness index in our culture by quite a bit. Under Seinfeld's spell many now find it perfectly acceptable to diminish others with smugness and lofty superiority. Contempt for others is NOT funny. In MAD ABOUT YOU one finds no artificial niceness, no vapid sentimentality, but the real warmth of real people who, in spite of their conflicts, love and respect each other.",1203811200,8,936,4.783950617283951

So, yes, I'm going to be the world's biggest fan of this show. But the truth is, before I met Mr. Zorich, I never liked it. I found it to be forced and over-the-top and the humor was based on screaming and facial expressions more than clever writing (which I love).

And who can forget the dog? I mean Helen Hunt has to be the worst comedic actress since Eddie Murphy in ""Pluto Nash."" I've heard that Ms. Hunt can be difficult to work with and it's apparent from her peformances that she definitely didn't bring much to the show beyond her gorgeous head of hair and her ample forehead.

Anyway, Paul Reiser was terrific as Paul. But this felt like a b-list assemblage of Seinfeld wannabes. Without the cultural hipness, acute observation of human behavior and a delightfully plump, bespectacled neighbor.",1148256000,,867,4.616883116883117

This is the one show that gives a mostly accurate picture of what to expect in marriage. No, not all couples live in NY, own a dog and have a zany cast of family members and friends to surround them, but this was the closely thing to real marriage to be found on tv.  I hate that I didn't appreciate it when it was on in primetime--I got addicted to it on Lifetime reruns--but if I had watched it when it was on, I doubt I would have had the appreciation I have for it now because I was too young to catch some of the jokes.

Hunt and Reiser have become some of my fave actors because of this show.

This set of the first season is awesome. Check it out for some real, gritty slices about marriage and life.

1459883,4,B00005JLIB,"Nominated for 45 Emmys, and winner of 16 during its eight-year run on NBC, Mad About You became an instant smash hit among TV viewers, in large part due to its Seinfeldian portrayals of married life in the big city. Sporting a catchy piano-laden theme song, the series showcased the unique comic talents of co-creator and co-star Paul Reiser, who sought to produce a show telling the true story of married life (he would later publish the bestselling book Couplehood, a compilation of various anecdotes on relationships)...

Mad About You follows the lives of newlywed couple Paul (Paul Reiser) and Jamie Buchman (Helen Hunt), two urban professionals sharing an apartment in New York City. Although they are head-over-heals in love, the two appear to be near total opposites. Paul, a documentary filmmaker, is extremely meticulous, cautious, and careful. Jamie, on the other hand, is a public relations expert with more of a free-spirit outlook on life. With a number of friends and family always in the picture - Jamie's sister Lisa (Anne Ramsay), Paul's cousin Ira (John Pankow), and friends Mark (Richard Kind) and Fran (Leila Kenzle) - Paul and Jamie are constantly bombarded with job-related stress, the strange antics of their friends, and the discovery each others' individual quirks and habits. And it's a recipe that translates into great sitcom entertainment...

The Mad About You (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Romantic Improvisations"" in which, following a mere five months of marriage, Jamie informs Paul that their sex life in not quite what it used to be. To rectify the situation, Paul comes home early from work intent on planning a romantic evening, but everything unravels when the two discover that both of them thought the other one had cancelled their scheduled dinner plans with friends... Other notable episodes include ""Out of the Past"" in which Paul invites Jamie to a personal reunion with his ex-girlfriend, and ""Token Friend"" in which Paul avoids the subway when he discovers a former friend from film school is now a token clerk at the local station...

Below is a list of episodes included on the Mad About You (Season 1) DVD:

1459885,3,B00005JLIB,"Every time I sit through the opening titles of ""Mad About You,"" I see the same credit pop up:  ""Created by Paul Reiser and Danny Jacobson.""

It took two people.  Two people.  To get this concept:  We have a guy. . .and a girl. . .and they're pretty newly married and they. . .live. . .in New York.

I just can't imagine how many sleepless nights Mr. Reiser and Mr. Jacobson spent locked in a room together before they hammered out the subtleties of that arrangement.

But I shouldn't criticize, because the truth is that many successful and entertaining sitcoms (""Friends,"" for one) aren't built upon stellar concepts so much as solid writing and comic delivery.  So it is with ""Mad About You,"" a show that, although probably not up for many ""Funniest Show of the Century"" awards, is a nice way to spend 23 minutes of your life.

The show is about Paul (Paul Reiser) and Jamie (Helen Hunt) Buchman, newlyweds who live in the City.  Paul is a documentary filmmaker, which sometimes comes into play, and Jamie does something at a PR firm, which is really not important.  They have friends, too:  Mark and Fran, Jamie's sister Lisa and Paul's friend Selby who, somewhere near the middle of the first season, undergoes a strange metamorphasis and changes actors and becomes Paul's cousin Ira.  There is nothing notably different about these two characters.

But, anyway.  The cornerstone of the show is definitely Paul and Jamie's relationship.  I'm amazed at how often their dynamic echoes that of me and my wife.  Paul is wise-cracking and pretty laidback in an obsessive, neurotic sort of way; Jamie is more high-strung and worrisome, also in a neurotic sort of way.  They make a cute couple.

And that's what the show has going for it.  It's not spellbinding or anything and it's not hillarious.  But it's fun.  You may forget the episode you just watched immediately after turning off your television, but you will not feel like you just completely wasted the time.  That's important.  Something good to put on when eating a meal or feeding the little precious baby girl.  That's what I do.

Highlights of this season are:  ""Out of the Past,"" in which Paul gets the chance to catch up with an old crush; ""Sunday Times,"" in which the two decide they should go do something on Sunday, but can't seem to actually get out to do it; ""Sofa's Choice,"" all about buying a couch. . .or love seat, really; ""Token Friend,"" in which Paul encounters a bitter former film student who blames Paul for his life failures; ""Maid About You,"" where Paul has a hard time letting a hired maid clean up the place without helping her; ""The Apartment,"" in which Jamie wants Paul to end the lease on his old bachelor pad; ""Love Among the Tiles,"" which sticks them inside a bathroom for the entire episode; and ""Met Someone,"" my personal favorite, a charming flashback to when Paul and Jamie met.

Special guest stars is also the name of the game this season, especially on Disc 2.  Michael Richards has a cameo as his ""Seinfeld"" character Kramer in ""The Apartment""; ""The Man Who Said Hello"" centers on Regis Philbin; and ""The Spy Girl Who Loved Me"" stars Barbara Feldon as an Diana Rigg-type star.

These stars have varying degrees of success, but one disappointment was the episode ""The Billionaire,"" starring Jerry Lewis.  I know how the writers wrote this episode:  ""So, we found out that we can get Jerry Lewis.""  ""Great!  Let's write an episode for it.""  ""Okay!  Any ideas?""  ""No!""  The episode is obsessed with using Mr. Lewis as much as possible, which is fine and great and it's nice to see him on screen. . .but the way in which they write him into the show is incredibly contrived.  His storyline is never even wrapped up.  He just blows in and out of Paul and Jamie's life like a hurricane. . .which might work but really, really doesn't.

All in all, however, it's a nice little set.  And get it now if you're interested because they discontinued the hop to DVD for ""Mad About You"" after Season 2.  But you can witness the beginning of a show that was one of NBC's most reliable comedies for years.  It's worth a viewing.",1098144000,9,4108,4.6146408839779

1459963,5,B00005JLIB,"This was proably one of my favorite shows, and I've missed it since it went off the air. Thankfully, they decided to release them on DVD.
I disagree with some other reviewers that they are disappointed to not have any special features. Honestly, how often - if at all - do you look at the special features on your other DVDs?  I say just give me the show and keep the cost down.  I don't need the fancy packaging or the behind-the-scenes when the price is this reasonable.  Honestly, I probably would not have purchased this at a higher price, and I'm so glad I did.  I started watching this show in the early years of my engagement and marriage.  It was the ideal to me - I've had fun looking back and realizing both how naive I was, and how much of the show I appreciate more now.
Don't be expecting anything but the 22 episodes from the first season, and you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, it's as good as you remember.",1048809600,7,925,4.323699421965318
1459964,3,B00005JLIB,"Mad About You has finally made it's way to DVD, but is it worth the price. In my opinion yes, but with some flaws.
The series is on two discs, with eleven episodes on each disc. A Spanish language track is available as are closed capitioning for English and Spanish. Visually the series looks the same as it did when it aired, minus the annoying logo in the corner. I've heard some complaints that the picture looks grainy, but I have not noticed it. I have noticed that there are some scenes that have been removed from the syndicated series are back in the show, so that is a plus.
The major problem that I have with this set is the fact that the episodes do not have chapter stops. So if you want to skip ahead in the episode, you have to fast forward through the show. Another problem that I have is that there aren't any extra's on the disc. Not a major deal, but it would be nice to at least have a 'behind the scenes' featurette.
If you like Mad About You, you should probably pick this set up. But be forewarned, all you are getting is the shows and nothing more.",1047686400,33,1071,4.203883495145631
1459965,2,B00005JLIB,"Like a lot of people, I loved the first few years of Mad About You, when it was really well-written romantic comedy about a newlywed couple negotiating the difficulties of settling into a marriage.  The video quality on these discs isn't perfect, but it's certainly good enough to enjoy these episodes all over again.
HOWEVER, some insane person made the decision to run the episodes on the discs in *production* order instead of *air-date* order, and the consequence is that parts of the series make no sense whatsoever -- for example, the discs swap episodes 2 and 4, so that the couple have in episodes 2 and 3 the couch they buy in ep 4 (originally episode 2).  Something even worse is done with the last two episodes of the season, swapping them and thereby ruining both the story arc and the symmetry intended for the season finale.
I think we should all write angry letters to the studio protesting this idiotic decision and demanding better treatment for future releases.  And, when available, a free replacement with the episodes in the right order.
In the meantime, if you loved Mad About You, you'll probably have to buy the set and reorder the episodes manually.

But they've also sacrificed image quality in order to cram 22 episodes on 2 discs. The bit rate is quite low (around 3 1/2 to 4) resulting in a really fuzzy picture. I mean, you could get a better picture recording it off of television on your VHS!
I just hope that Sony doesn't release the remainder of the seasons in this disgraceful low bit rate format.

The box is very slim (which I like - shelf space is a scarce resource here). It comes with only 2 DVDs (11 episodes each) and a small episode guide in a sheet of paper, that's it.
There's no additional material whatsoever (no featurettes, etc), which is fine with me anyway, since I'd rather get all the episodes at this very decent price than pay... more for an interview or whatever.
Picture quality is very good, which is news to a 10 years old TV show put in DVD. It was quite a pleasant surprise.
Audio comes in English, French, and Spanish (they didn't use the same dubbing as the broadcast in Spain, though). Subtitles come only in English, but both as standard DVD subtitles and closed captions.",1036195200,24,941,4.445086705202312

1460052,3,B00005JLIB,"While ""Mad About You"" would go on to become one of the definitive sitcoms of the 1990s, its first season was a little rocky.  To be certain, much of the later greatness could been seen (especially at the beginning and end of the season), but rotating characters and a few truly awful episodes made for a rocky start for this series.
The first season showed that Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt had great chemistry together as newlyweds Paul and Jamie Buchman, but many of their friends had difficult beginnings - especially Paul's friends Selby (who disappears by episode 13) and Ira (who appears, initially, as an even less-likeable version of the eternal bachelor Selby).  The episodes that really stand out from the season are the ones that deal with Paul and Jamie's newlywed issues - how they met, whether Paul should give up his old bachelor pad, their first anniversary - but there are also some truly unfortunate episodes from the season, especially Jerry Lewis' execrable turn as an eccentric billionaire.  Likewise, the first episode featuring Paul's father shows only a little of the depth that his family would later have.  All that aside, though, the first season is definitely strong enough to want to buy - unless, of course, you look at the discs from a technical perspective.
While the price for the series is great, I would happily have seen them add another ten or twenty dollars to the price tag to have another disc.  Not only is the set devoid of any extras (save multilingual tracks), but the compression of 11 episodes on to each disc makes each look impressively bad on a laptop or HDTV system.  On a normal TV from six feet or more away, it looks fine, but I pity the person taking this set with them on an airplane flight.
All in all, it'd hard not to be disappointed in this release.  I'm always glad to see more TV series released in full-season formats on DVD, but presentations such as this make you very disappointed in the companies that release them.  Maybe Columbia-Tristar will get the hint for Season 2 and put out a much better release.  It would be a shame to see them stop with this season just because they did a bad job with it technically.",1035590400,93,2177,4.619170984455959
