3000773,5,B000XCZGX6,"I can't believe anyone would complain about the cost.  I was thrilled that it finally came out on DVD.  A friend got the series on Ebay (It was a VHS to DVD transfer) and of really poor quality, but at least it was the complete series. Now, we die- hard fans can have what we only dreamed of having.  Just buy and enjoy all the magic that was Beauty & The Beast!  This is something that will never come to TV again, and I for one, will have the entire series as it was meant to be viewed...commercial free and I can watch as many times as I want!  Thank you so much!!",1194652800,6,567,3.982300884955752
3000774,4,B000XCZGX6,"If you haven't already seen it, I think it's only fair you find out about Catherine's death before you buy Season 3. The third season is good storytelling. It is done with as much quality as the rest of the show, even if it does have a bit of a surreal feeling sometimes (as if the whole thing was a very long, very bad dream). Walk Slowly, the second episode, remains the most tragically beautiful thing I've ever seen on a tv show. Diana was a great character, though the writers try to force the beginnings of a new romance with Vincent, and it's just ridiculously too soon for that. Almost the entire season is extremely dark, a very different show from the first 2 seasons.",1194566400,10,678,4.388888888888889
3000775,5,B000XCZGX6,"The third season of Beauty and the Beast always gets a bad rap. However, it was an excellent season. I loved Diana.  She was brave and strong like Catherine, protected Vincent, and remained respectful to Catherine's memory throughout.  It appears to me that viewers feel that to like Diana somehow betrays Catherine; when in fact we can love them both. If the series had continued on with Diana I would have continued watching for years.  However, CBS chose to end the series where they did and I feel that they did it very nicely.  The writers left us with hope and promise of a full and happy life for Vincent.",1194134400,8,612,4.536363636363636
3000776,3,B000XCZGX6,"Hmmm, something smells wrong here. Season 3 is 13 episodes (if you count THOUGH LOVERS BE LOST as 2 eps) and it is priced higher than either Seasons 1 or 2 which had 22 episodes each?  I mean if this final season was loaded with extras sure, but if all we get is 13 eps, $60 retail? REALLY? WITH A STRAIGHT FACE? ;)",1193788800,13,315,4.0
3000777,5,B000XCZGX6,"What can one really say about a show as magical as this one?

The first two seasons introduced us to a world of wonderful characters.  We grew fond of them and loved them all, for various reasons, but especially Vincent and Catherine.

Then tragedy struck and everything changed.  The world was no longer as safe as it had been with the Beast protecting Beauty.  Now it was a vital search for their legacy with a new and different Beauty.

Season 3 is not everyone's cup of tea but, once I'd gotten over the shock, I came to appreciate it.  It was as close to real life as this show would ever come - bad things happen to good people for no rhyme or reason and the strength of their character shows through in how they deal with adversity.

And adversity there was in plenty - with Gabriel, one of the most urbanely evil portrayals I have ever seen, having stolen the legacy and the original Beauty in the first place; through the perils of addiction; the memorable Snow; uneasy associations with all of the men who loved Catherine; and the growing knowledge that love endures in many forms.

This was a fantastic show.  The 3rd season is not what I would have originally wished for and brought me to tears by the end of the two-part opening but, like Vincent, I learned there was more to life and love.  This shortened season, with its major villain and a story arc to tie it all together became compulsive viewing.

This is well worth the price of admission.",1193702400,16,1460,4.447368421052632

As with many others, I thought the concept, scripts, acting, production were all excellent. In my opinion, they should have ended the series right after Vincent named the baby at the ceremony.

No extras to really speak off, except season recap, the actors and fans talking about what the show means to them, and bloopers. I think the show could have be something more than about Vincent and Catherine's love; more J.T. and Tess - their relationship and Heather and her relationships.

3000893,1,B000XCZGX6,"I give the show 5 stars but for the DVD product I am downgrading my rating and I have allowed plenty of positive ratings to be added before my Season 4 Review so it doesn't damage the product's rating but should be found in the critical review of this show as a major fan complaint.  It has been 4 years since I complained about the lack of a Blu-ray release for this series in 2012.

Aside from ""Arrow"", this was the other show at the time that was also broadcasted on the CW nework in 1080i HD and in 5.1 surround sound that peaked my interest in their network when it first aired.

Unfortunately, it baffles me why ""Arrow"" has a Blu-ray / DVD release and yet ""Beauty and the Beast"" Season 1, 2, 3 and the 4th and Final Season ""STILL"" have not received their Blu-ray release. Was it to not confuse customers from the Disney Blu-ray release? I doubt it and people can distinguish box covers from animation and the real deal. I think fans and customers should let CW know that we want a Blu-ray version of their show either in a single season release or an exclusive BOXED SET BLU-RAY release with extras.

Most shows released today are dual format released or Blu-ray / DVD combo packages. People who have not seen the show in HD TV will probably not know what they are missing in terms of picture and sound quality which draw you into the story more.  One person commented they saW an episode on Youtube and thought the DVD version was just as good.  Most Youtube videos are SD in quality so that doesn't surprise me.  If they saw it on the air in 1080i HD quality they would be unimpressed with the Youtube video.  If this show had only been broadcast in SD like DVD quality it would have not engaged me as much at the time as seeing the characters sharp and alive alongside with the 5.1 audio track added another level to the show that no Youtube or Standard Definition DVD could compare.

Bring out the Blu-ray release of this wonderful show for Season 1, 2, 3, and the 4th and Final Season for your wonderful fans.

Don't make this into another DVD only release since Season 1 and then vanish off the air leaving us with this second rate quality nostalgia. This show deserves more respect and the crew who painstakingly spent the time on making this show deserve it to be seen in the best picture and sound quality as it originally aired on the CW network in 1080i and 5.1 audio.  Make this a true 1080P 7.1 audio DTS release so this show will look and sound even better than on the original HD broadcast.

Anyone with me on this voice your opinion below and let them know unless you want to be stuck with pathetic low quality Standard Definition low quality replica of the original show that shined and sounded!  Don't let this show be another one of those cancelled shows that will only let you relive in nostalgia in second rate quality.  I still got my DVRed 1080i High Definition recordings but I would definitely buy a Complete 4 Seasons Blu-ray Boxed Set with Extras.  If this continues without a Blu-ray release you will start seeing people stop buying DVDs and holding out because they pale in comparison to what you truly could have given them.  In 10 years you'll see old DVR HD recordings popping up on Youtube and the internet because they crave for the best quality of the show that you gave them on the TV screen but didn't fulfill in their home.

If you're truly a fan of this show voice your comment below and with enough comments maybe they will finally listen and give us what we truly want.

I recall asking for a Closed Captioning on an old TV series called ""Sledge Hammer"".  I left a comment on a website ages ago asking that the second season include it.  Surprisingly one of the guys involved with the production of the show told Alan Spencer about it and I got an email saying he would add it into the second season and that is why only the Second Season of Sledge Hammer has closed captioning and not the first.  Although they did release the two seasons as a Complete Series I haven't checked whether they added it to the first season in the Complete Series release as I only bought the individual original seasons release.  So you never know who is listening and watching these reviews but I was a nobody leaving a comment and Alan Spencer got it done which impressed me.

Hopefully those same ears might be around for this show... :)",1481414400,,4368,4.4054726368159205

3000921,4,B000XCZGX6,"When I bought this series on dvd many years ago, I was swept away in this show. I remembered when it aired, Catherine (Linda Hamilton) was not continuing with the show. I recently read that she was pregnant at the time and didn't want to continue with a baby on the way. Most shows would either replace her character or end the series there. I didn't want to see how they ended her character so I never bought the 3rd season. I guess I forgot because I recently pulled out the 1st season while on vacation and once again was swept away in this epic love story! Then came season 2 and not happy with being left hanging, I searched my collection for season 3 when I remembered I never bought it. It turns out my sister had the entire collection and I borrowed her 3rd season - I loved it! I loved Diana (who could never replace Catherine) but was compelling and critical to Vincent's success at finding his son. The creepy man who took Vincent's son was nothing short of vile and brilliant and Snow - another great character made the show just as enjoyable. Season 3 could never top the heart-warming, deep love experienced by Vincent and Catherine that made this show great but it made me want to keep watching to see the inevitable rescue of Vincent's son! So now, I have just purchased Season 3 to conclude this wonderful must-have collection! I highly recommend it!",1462060800,,1367,4.472

3000926,3,B000XCZGX6,"Spoilers ahead, you have been warned!!  I love this series so much.  Season 1 and 2 were fantastic but sadly Linda Hamilton wanted to leave the show because of her pregnancy and that she felt her character was not being developed enough to make it worth staying on.  Take away a main character like that, in which the whole series is based around, means nothing but failure.  Trying to introduce a new love interest like Diana just doesn't work in a fairytale, no matter how dark this version is. They also mixed up a few episodes at the end and for some reason Prime is not showing the very last episode, Episode 12 titled Legacies. It is part 2 and the finale is described as ""Upon returning to ""The World Below"" upon the knowledge of some of ex-tunnel inhabitants being murdered, Father encounters Gregory Coyle who seeks revenge for the death of his father by cave-in 20 years ago. Diana makes it her mission to catch Gregory before he can kill another ex-inhabitant of ""The World Below.""  I remember watching this when it first aired.  At any rate, I prefer to end the series at the original naming ceremony in episode 9, Invictus, where Vincent's son is safe below, being named and a little clip of Catherine with tears in her eyes is looking down on them, like the angel she now is.  Also Walk Slowly, as heartbreaking as it is, is my favourite episode of this season.  Once you get over the sadness of this season, just go back to the beginning and watch Season 1 again and make up a happier ending for them all. That is what I do!  :)",1456012800,4,1543,4.424028268551237

The episode about Lover lost impacted us and I never will forget that episode. We were shocked and stunned. But the message of death having no dominion was clear a powerful. Unfortunately a few years later, I was placed in a position where I truly understood what it meant. My wife Shelia G. Wheeler went to glory and the words of this show never left me. The magic and spirituality of it all kept me strong. That was 1991. I was 32 at the time. At 57 I can honestly say though lovers be lost, love never is.

Some people accept whatever writers put on the series but others dont.  The season only had some 12 episodes, because the stories were not appeal.  And even when the new actors were good, season 3 didn't follow the passion, the sophistication, the music and the poetry the series had in the begining.  And the way they kill Catherine's character was to awful and cruel. She was tortured to death when she was pregnant. Kill a main character like Cathy was a big risk and in the end cost the series to end because the baby wasn't enough. I know LH wanted to leave, even so I was prefer that they maintain the character alive and just change the actress, maybe the series cancel anyway but Cathy would stay alive. When you saw the episodes you notice how the writters try so hard to get the attention, and the stories were twisted, contradictories, a little bit boring and silly...Season 1 and 2 were the best.

Moonlight ended with a closed door, I won't launch a spoiler.....It's just that we craved more......and the powers that be just didn't respond.

I vaguely remember the back and forth of Linda Hamilton leaving the series.....and the upheaval it caused.  I had remembered how the viewers rallied to get the show back on.  I was one of them begging for more Vincent and Catherine.

I hadn't remembered how much the transition changed the dynamics.

Yes, we got to see more action, more angst (a trademark of the Koslow shows) and we got to meet Diana, a woman who thru the mechanics of the costume department seemed to be more of a Tunnel woman than Catherine.  Diana appears to blend right in with her long french braided hair, natural glow and layers of loose clothing.....Did they do that on purpose???

They could have really went with this show if all of us die hard Cathrine Chandler fans would have given it a chance.

3001076,3,B000XCZGX6,"Note: This review contains spoilers. Anyone who was a fan of this series will want to have this season in their collection. After all, a collection isn't a collection unless it's complete. Having said that however, the choices made by the writers and producers of ""Beauty and the Beast"" were poor. This story--at its core--is a fairytale. Fairytales must have happy endings, or they're not fairytales. It wasn't worth twelve rather unsatisfying episodes to compromise the integrity of the fairytale genre. It would have been much more rewarding--and honest--to have ended the series with Catherine realizing that she had done all she had set out to do in the world above--and joyfully accepting that her future would properly be spent with Vincent, and their son, in the world below. Having Vincent lose his empathic connection with Catherine was a big mistake, since that bond is the entire premise on which their relationship was based. Killing off Catherine was, of course, the ultimate error--because it simply is not the way a ""true"" fairytale should end. Season III, in and of itself, isn't wholly ""bad"" television, but it is mediocre. It actually contains some fine moments, particularly for some of the secondary and recurring guest characters (such as Joe Maxwell and Elliot Burch, respectively). In addition, unlike some other reviewers, I found the character of Diana quite interesting, primarily because what she and Vincent develop is a friendship. It could not possibly be more. However, the evil characters in this season were silly and boring--and too much time was spent on them. The season would have redeemed itself far better if they had spent more time on a more romantic storyline, since the whole series was intended to be a romance. For example, they could have focused on Joe's coming to terms with the love he felt for (but never expressed to) Catherine--AND they could have developed a meeting/friendship between Joe and Vincent. (After all, the love Joe felt for Catherine was far less selfish than what Elliot felt for her.) Or, they might have pursued a romantic interest developing between Joe and Diana--perhaps even with Vincent's help. Joe Maxwell, in particular, was a wonderful character who was left wholly unresolved in the series, and that is unfortunate. Although I still believe the third season never should have happened--there are ways in which it could have been better.",1256342400,4,2415,5.101010101010101

3001091,3,B000XCZGX6,"As a lover of romantic storylines, this was is, by far, my favorite. I enjoyed the relationship between the contemporary beauty Catherine Chandler and the regal beast Vincent. Theirs was a love that has made most love stories pale in comparison and one I will not forget. It seemed as if it would continue.

But all of this changes when tragedy occurs and Vincent finds himself alone. Overcome by grief, Vincent lashes out at anyone who tries to get too close, but must become strong again when he discovers he and Catherine's child has been taken by an evil drug lord named Gabriel, who sees the child as ""a perfect creation."" While Vincent employs the aid of Catherine's former flame, former tycoon Elliot Burch, to save his son, the lines between justice and revenge, good and evil blur into one. The arrival of a detective named Diana will move the ball forward to the conclusion.

 I was devastated by Catherine's death and Vincent's grief.  Ron Perlman was able to communicate the depths of Vincent's emotions to a deep level, one which carried itself off the screen and into my heart. The following determination to find his and Catherine's child is what keeps him motivated to live, and what will eventually be the thing that puts him at peace.

My reason for the three stars is for this: after a while Vincent's quest to save his son began to feel like it was being stretched out. I know it sounds petty but there were times when I began to question the storyline. Gabriel the drug lord is designed as this menacing genius who can elude the higher powers, but after a few episodes they turn him into a philosophical clown. The presence of Diana, while an interesting facet into the secrets of the mole peoples' existence and her desire to solve Catherine's case, seemed convoluted and forced. Are we to believe that she can easily earn the trust and possible love of Vincent and his family? We're told we can, but this happens quickly and without question.

It's not perfect, but it's still worth seeing, and even though I didn't particularly enjoy the way it ended, it brought me to tears, so I know it still held that power.",1242604800,3,2135,4.634920634920635

As romantic as Catherine/Vincent was, I think Diana has the backbone needed to stand up to Vincent and eventually tell him to get over himself in regards to his Byronic Hero tendencies, i.e. his ""we can't be together because of what I am, oh woe is me"" drivel.  It might have been romantic when I was a teenager, but in my thirties, I have quickly gotten over it.  Someone needed to drive some sense into Vincent's head, and frankly, Catherine was never going to be that person.  I think Diana could have been that person.

3001100,4,B000XCZGX6,"It's been over 20 years since BATB originally came on the air. (I was just entering my teen years at the time.) As a kid growing up under difficult circumstances, this show opened my eyes to the possibility of being more than I ever thought I could be. Corny as it may be - I believe this show made me a better person. With that said, it has taken me 18 years to come to terms with the death of Catherine Chandler. LOL. I was one who wrote in to CBS trying to ""save the show,"" and when Linda Hamilton left, and Catherine died, my teenage psyche was too young to handle her loss. Had I known - I probably would have preferred a really good ""happily ever-after"" tv movie to wrap up the show.

Now as a woman - I was finally able to watch the last 12 episodes and come to terms with the changes in the show. (Yes, I am aware this is fiction!) Obviously, the tone of BATB changed with the loss of Catherine, but her presence was always underlying. Overall I enjoyed watching the final 12 shows, independent of the first two seasons.

3001114,5,B000XCZGX6,"""Beauty and the Beast"" in its third season faced the same dilemma that hit ""The X-Files."" In both cases, a principal character around whom the series was based lost the actors (Linda Hamilton and David Duchovney, respectively) who were indelibly linked with that character. Fans would not have accepted a new Fox Mulder and the X Files without him truly lost its formerly brilliant way.

But I do not feel this was true with ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Although, like everyeone, I loved the special romance of our favorite beast man and Catherine, there really wasn't an undending array of story lines that the romance could have realistically sustained. (I have heard series writer/producer confess to this very difficulty.)The writers had already explored many of the problems that Catherine and Vincent's impossible affair created.  Where could they have taken it in the long haul?  Add that to the fact that their lead actress pulled out and they faced an interesting situation: Let the show die forever or continue to explore the ramifications of a Vincent tormented by the loss of Catherine.

I for one was far more attracted to the show because of Vincent than I ever was for Catherine.  He was its heart and soul, his poetic and haunted character the reason I tuned in every week.  I did not want to lose him, even without his beauty.  Ron Perlman was simply wonderful in the role of a lifetime.  I was perfectly willing to watch what might become of him in light of his tragedy.  Like others, I was deeply touched by the bonds between Elliot Burch (always a plus on the show) and Joe and Vincent in their united fight against the man who murdered the woman they all loved.  And Gabriel was a delicious villain. (Gabriels seem to make splendid villains, as any Dorothy Dunnett fan can attest.)

I for one really liked Diana! I thought she had grit and integrity. I also think that falling in love with someone who was himself grieving for the loss of the love of his life was itself high romance and I really felt for her plight.  I would not have wanted a romance to blossom too quickly, but to me, her love for him (we all loved him; why shouldn't the new chick?) and his struggle to be loyal to his memories of Catherine and yet try to find happiness in a world without her were far more intriguing possibilities that what the writers were facing with Vincent and Catherine alone.

I didn't like having the baby around.  Never a good idea.  But I commend everyone associated with the third season for a handful of episodes with high drama, passion, poignancy and, most of all, their gallant attempt to keep Vincent in my life.  Those of you who thrive only on the bright and lovely side of a great love may not find season three to be your cup of tea. But the rest of you, drink up!

3001119,1,B000XCZGX6,"Warning #1: YES--THERE ARE SPOILERS.  Warning #2: Thinkers only beyond this point.
Saying that the third season of CBS's Beauty and the Beast is just a different direction for the same show is like saying that The Little Mermaid (either Disney's OR Hans Christian Andersons) would be the same, um, tale if the Prince served the little mermaid as the entree at his wedding feast.  What happened in third season made everything that happened before it a lie.  This once-lovely series hits an all-time network television low (which is really, REALLY difficult) in showing the torture and murder of a pregnant woman (must have been trying to appeal to terrorists) and making what THEY had loudly touted as a once-in-a-lifetime love a flavor-of-the-season.  If you don't believe (or won't believe) that love--real once-in-a-lifetime, once-and-forever love can exist in the modern world, then you just wouldn't (couldn't) GET what the first two seasons were about.  Catherine Chandler wasn't Vincent's current squeeze--she was his one-and-only-EVER soul-mate.  Until, of course, they decided that--men being fickle and all--Vincent could find a palatable substitute in any female that happened by.  If you can get beyond that--and most of the real fans DID NOT--then you have to watch Father undergo a complete personality change.  While once the brave and self-sacrificing patriarch of the Tunnel World who swore that it was possible to love an entire lifetime in just a few short days, Father, too, finds it possible to take up with some random woman and abandon all his ideals AND his responsibilities while he whines that he has a right to be happy.  And if you were able to stand THAT, then you got to watch the safe haven so painstakingly crafted from the love and protectiveness of thousands of city helpers ripped open and destroyed.  Same story?  ""Slight"" differences?  I don't think so.  But if you insist on watching this horrible travestry (which is beautifully filmed and mostly well-acted by the members of the cast who actually COULD act), you at least have the advantage of knowing the outcome beforehand.  Most of us who watched this terrible, flinch-inducing horror did it ONLY because we had been led to hope that there would be a happy ending after all.  We were shamefully betrayed, and in such a way as to make it obvious that those leading us gleefully down the primrose path with promises of happily ever after only meant ""happily for them.""  That EXACT plot line is currently running on Ron Koslow's latest CBS show (a SHOCKING display of originality) and will no doubt ultimately result in the same sort of flip dismissal of the hopes and dreams of those fans.  Claiming to like the third season of this show after loving the first two seasons is sortof like saying, ""I like to pet puppies.  But I also like to eat them.""  Truth be told, however, most viewers simply aren't that discriminating.  As long as there is something chasing something on the screen, and some violence and the possibility that someone might get to grope something eventually, most viewers will settle back--unthinking and uninterested in doing so.  If you wish to join them, feel free to pay twice the price for half the shows--and none of the value.

3001127,5,B000XCZGX6,"Ever season of Beauty and the Beast has woven its spell around me a different way. In the first season, we learn of the development of Catherine and Vincent's relationship, as well as being introduced to the wonderful people Below. In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trials and tribulations they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons.

The third season, in my opinion, is what really shines out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arcs completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best as Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what makes people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met.

You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell gets a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times. New character Diana certainly does NOT take Catherine's place, and her and Vincen't relationship is far from being a romantic one. I have read in places that she seems to have some sort of paranormal powers, but I have not seen that in the episodes I have watched so far. She seems to have excellent insticts and investigative skills.

Now the character Gabriel, man I love to hate this guy. He's just pure evil incarnate. You can tell that Vincent's son is sensitive to him, because every time Gabriel is in the room it seems the child gets distressed.

3001129,4,B000XCZGX6,"This show is one of those shows that has been with me virtually all my life. I remember watching Catherine fall dead into Vincent's arms and crying my eyes out when I was 9 years old. The emotional impact, though somewhat lost on me at the time, so stuck in my consciousness that I actually bought the VHS tapes, 2 episodes at a time, when they were being released that way, 10 years ago. But I purposefully avoided watching anything after ""Though Lovers Be Lost"". I assumed it would just be too painful.

In recent months, to my shock, I discovered that the DVDs were available, and bought seasons 1 and 2 and began watching them again. As an adult, the power and poigniency of this show hit me like a ton of bricks to a degree that it had never, before.

But, again, I was planning to avoid the third season this time too, save for ""Though Lovers Be Lost"" which I still had on VHS and is essential for at least a meager amount of closure. But the sense of loss and grief I felt when I finished watching it this time around was crushing.

After a few months of recuperating from her death, I decided that maybe I should give season 3 a chance. Which is what I am doing right this moment.

And here's what I've decided about the third season so far:

1)Thank God there was a 3rd season. I can only imagine how much it would have sucked if Linda Hamilton's leaving had left the show hanging entirely. I have had that experience with shows I loved far too many times.

2)Thank God they brought in Diana Bennet rather than trying to replace Catherine with a different actress. Not that I think they would have done that but it has been known to happen.

3)The fact of Catherine's death, though miserably sad, actually heightens the emotional punch of this love story. I mean, how boring would Romeo and Juliet be if nobody died?

4)At the end of ""Though Lovers Be Lost"", this most recent go around, I found myself just unbearably sad and kind of let down. Not remembering all the explicit details, I was surprised that Vincent didn't have more of a reaction to her death. More like the reaction she had, earlier in the episode, when she thought he was dying. It just seemed flat.

When I decided to give season 3 the benefit of the doubt, however, I found myself startled to realize that the second episode was EXACTLY what I had wanting from that story. It was a gem I was not expecting to find - a full episode that included a beautiful and well composed montage set to their beautiful theme song, a few more precious moments with Catherine (though she was dead), an actual kiss (though she was dead for that also) and 45 minutes of vincent weeping with grief and the sorrow of love cut short. Now THAT was worth spending the money on!",1202688000,17,2734,4.3767258382643
3001130,2,B000XCZGX6,"I still have all the VHS tapes I personally recorded of the show, on VHF, when they first aired on TV, so I have been watching those throughout these years and am thrilled that it's all on DVD now, even though this season was shortened and shortchanged. However, I am annoyed at whoever created the package for this 3rd season, as people who have just discovered the show will be very disappointed if they expect to see  exactly what is promised on the packaging itself. Linda Hamilton only appears in the very first 2 episodes of the final season. The package back, in very small print, states ""Some episodes May be edited from their original network versions"". If you saw the very first original TV Broadcasts, and compare things taped directly at that time with these DVD's, then you will see that things on the this DVD version (and on VHS versions SOLD before this) have been changed about here and there. Whether you do or don't like the packing people mucking about with the true original airings is a personal thing. People should just be aware that these dvd's have been edited/changed a bit here and there and should be forewarned that they are not what was originally aired on TV.",1202428800,5,1191,4.617924528301887
3001131,4,B000XCZGX6,"The 3rd season of Beauty and the Beast definitely takes the series in a very different direction.  As the new opening reveals, once Vincent gets past Catherine's murder he will dedicate his life to avenging injustice - in other words, he has been recast here as a sort of beastly Batman, searching the skies for the Beast Signal which will let him know that his services are needed.  Much of the first five or six episodes are focused more on the gritty world Above than on Vincent's world in the tunnels - the photography is very different, with a sharper, darker overcast (much of the warmth associated with the tunnel worlds is lost). Additionally, character inconsistencies (especially with Roy Dotrice's ""Father"") undermine the overall fabric of the story for those of us who followed it closely the first two seasons.  This is a much more violent show now, and it's much more ""black and white.""  The new villain, Gabriel, who dominates many of the episodes, is simply evil personified - there is no development of his character, no understanding of his motivations.  He is simply evil, and Vincent becomes the force of good which will win in the end.  Gabriel is Paracelsus without the poetry, without the history that made his demonic persona work.  There was always a hint with Paracelsus that what he really wanted was to be part of the tunnel community again, but he just couldn't figure out a way to do it.  The only thing we know about Gabriel is that he's a monster.

Catherine's death itself is not what changed this series - actually, Diana's character could very easily have become a new ""Beauty"" for Vincent, had the relationship been given a chance to develop.  The problem is the new tone, the darker perspective, the shift away from the tunnel community that had dominated the second season, and the fans' resistance to anything that even suggested that Vincent could move beyond his bond with Catherine and love another woman.  The message of the first two seasons is clearly the power of love to conquer hate and fear; this would imply that Catherine's love for Vincent SHOULD enable him to love again - after all, that's what he always told her about the nature of love.  Here, in Season Three, Vincent's grief is palpable, and Ron Perlman does an amazing job demonstrating what it is to feel loss.  But there are subtle moments between him and Diana that are hopeful and beautiful - and I, as a fan of the series, find solace in such hope.

While watching the first episode (Though Lovers be Lost) is not easy, know that there are things beyond it of great value.  Elliot Burch's character, especially, is given both a chance to redeem himself and chance to give Catherine a beautiful gift.  Diana becomes a fascinating and original character whose own connection to Vincent is believable and real - she is not Catherine, but rather an independent and introspective woman who may have much more in common with Vincent spiritually than Catherine ever did.  It would be so easy to see Diana becoming a part of Vincent's world.  So, suffer through the difficult death and grieving scenes, be prepared for the shift in focus, but enjoy the new stories being told here about Vincent and the two worlds in which he lives.  Yes, it's flawed - but there is still enough beauty to justify a return visit.",1202428800,56,3319,4.720970537261699
3001132,4,B000XCZGX6,"I know I'll get slammed for it but I admired the writing of the third season.

The writers did the best they could with what they were dealt...the pressure of the fans wanting more and Linda Hamilton not coming back.  Yes, as an obsessed fan I was devastated by what occurred but the writing continued to be excellent and actually pretty clever I thought.  I wish though that they had completed a full third season; it would have been interesting to see what they would have come up with.

After all of these years I'm amazed that there are still so many of us even thinking about this show....before I discovered the many B&B websites and then that they were releasing the DVD's I thought I was alone!

3001133,4,B000XCZGX6,"I must say I am surprised to read some of the reviews here. I was not aware of any debate surrounding this third and last season of the show, and I find it somehow odd that it came as a disappointment for many fans, when to me it's clearly superior to the previous two seasons by leaps and bounds.

The show turned into quite a different animal (no pun intended), discarding much of its bland, mushy romanticism for a much more real romantic, epic feel and a sense of mythology. Stephen McHattie great turn as Vincent's archnemesis served the story well and gave it a strong, compelling focus that it was sorely lacking. Even Linda Hamilton's much lamented departure was an invigorating shakedown that managed to make matters fresh and, what's more, relevant.

If you only watch one season of this show, this is definitely the one to pick.",1200960000,10,839,4.624161073825503
3001134,5,B000XCZGX6,"The third season is not to be reviled, instead it should be savored as a true and little-seen treasure. There is no joy without sorrow and the relationship between Vincent and Katherine, which flourished during the first two seasons, is what sustains Vincent in his time of sorrow. Indeed, Katherine's love is what sustains Joe as well as Elliot throughout their confrontation with Gabriel and allows Elliot to make the ultimate sacrifice. Season 3 is taunt, very well paced and probably the best written season of the entire series. Love does not last forever, but it is the memory of love that sustains us. Ron Perlman rocks in this season!",1200614400,12,642,4.845454545454546
3001135,5,B000XCZGX6,"I am an all-season fan of Beauty and the Beast, meaning I love all three seasons--but as a fanzine writer, I wrote primarily ""fourth season"", or what I thought had happened after third season. The third season of Beauty and the Beast offers some of the most dramatic and well-written television that has ever aired. The acting was superb. Once you begin watching, you will be riveted.

Jo Anderson as Diana is lovely, brave and poignant...desperately in love, before she ever meets him, with a man who may never love her. Ron Perlman as Vincent is even more incredible than he was in the first two seasons. They compliment once another beautifully.

Does third season get a bad rap? Yes. But see for yourself and watch it.

Looking at Beauty and the Beast as a whole story is, to my mind, essential to come to appreciate the vast range of emotion and depth of perception the series portrays.

To watch this show over twenty years later is to fall backwards in time and re-experience the magic. Watch the show all the way through...again. And if you've never seen it, don't miss it this time!

3001136,5,B000XCZGX6,"I am very passionate about the 1980s television series, ""Beauty and the Beast.""  The Third Season DVDs are just as beautifully digitally remastered as the first and second seasons were.  Masterful acting by the two main stars of the series, Ron Perlman, who plays Vincent (The Beast), and Linda Hamilton, who plays Catherine Chandler (Beauty), continues in the third and final chapter of this poignant series.  This season of the series portrays the heartbreaking grief experienced by Vincent, the Beast who lives in caves and tunnels under the streets of New York City when the love of his life, Catherine Chandler, an investigative lawyer working in the District Attorney's office is kidnapped and murdered by an human monster.  It masterfully portrays how love is an eternal journey.  Now, please don't despair over the demise of the television series, because the story is not quite over!

Because of my love of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" I began writing a novel which is a sequel to this series in early July of 2007.  I completed and published it in May of 2008.  The title of my book is ""Love's Journey to Awakening--Beauty and the Beast--Happily Ever After.""  I wrote it under my pen name, Laurel Cain Haws, and my editor is Dr. Thayle K. Anderson, an English professor emeritus from Murray State University.  He is a trusted friend, and a colleague of my beloved late husband, Dr. Gary L. Haws, who was my ""Vincent.""

My book has a very specific target audience, those who loved this series starring Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton, and hated its premature demise with its tragic ending.  My book fixes that.  It doesn't change the ending.  It begins where the series ends and changes the outcome, so it has an happy ending and perhaps a new beginning for more stories about these beloved characters.

If that idea appeals to you, it is essential that you watch all 3 seasons before reading my book.  Even if you saw them when they first aired 20-plus years ago, you really need to review and watch them again in order to fully understand and appreciate my book.  I never get tired of watching them, and I hope that you will enjoy seeing these characters come back to life with a new story line.

The questions from the series that my novel answers are:
1. Is Catherine Chandler (Beauty) really dead?
2. Where did Vincent (the Beast) really come from?
3. Can there be an happy ending to a modern day fairy tale that starts out, ""Once Upon a Time in the City of New York?""

Buy all three seasons of the series that are now available.  Then visit my website, where you can download a free copy of my entire novel.  My website link can be accessed at kandycain1587 ""My World"" on eBay or on my profile page on Amazon.  The timeline and characters are very precious to me, and I was very careful with them.  I hope that you will enjoy reading my book as much as I enjoyed writing it.  Karen L. Haws-Dearing",1199318400,2,2906,4.608949416342412
3001137,4,B000XCZGX6,"Note: This review contains SPOILERS.

This is an issue that has divided Beauty & The Beast fans for almost twenty years, and reading the reviews here, I can see a lot of people are still bitter. While the show certainly suffered the loss of Linda Hamilton, I personally found there was still plenty to enjoy in this abbreviated season.

For one thing, the season-long story arc served the show quite well. The second season's cliffhanger ending left a lot for the writers to explore. So much fuss was made way back in 1989 about the show being ""retooled"" to attract more male viewers. And I'll admit, there's probably a sizable portion of the potential male viewing audience that is attracted to the increased action and violence. But was the show really THAT different? We still have Ron Perlman and all the others giving it their all (and it was quite an emotional and yes, violent arc for Vincent). The late, talented Edward Albert got moved into a series regular slot. And I can't think of another series villain as vile as Stephen McHattie's Gabriel. And for you action fans, there's Lance Henriksen's appearance as the vicious assassin, Snow.

Even amid all the death and sorrow, there are moments of beauty. ""Walk Slowly,"" the follow-up to the 2-hour season premiere, is one of the best-written episodes of the entire series. Jo Anderson is no Linda Hamilton, but she evidences real concern and determination to help Vincent. And the return of Rolley (from season two's ""Chamber Music"") evokes sympathy, as well as reminds us that there was always more to this fictional universe than just Vincent and Catherine.

To the uninitiated who may not have seen this season: It's really not as bad as many people would have you believe. If you accept that Linda Hamilton only appears in 2 episodes, maybe that will lessen your potential disappointment. And if you've followed the story this far, it just makes sense to see it through to the end. No, it's NOT as good as the first two years. But it's still a great show, and I hope you will give it a chance.

The only other concern I have, as others have pointed out, is that the asking price for a shortened (12 episodes) season is the same as for a full season.  But as any true fan will tell you, it's something of a minor miracle that we're finally getting season 3 on home video in ANY format.  I'm grateful for that, and I have no hesitation in shelling out the $$ to complete my set.",1197936000,93,2440,4.608294930875576
3001138,1,B000XCZGX6,"Well I have always loved seasons one and two and when three came along. It broke my heart. I have always believed and still do that they should have ended the series with Vincent and Catherine together with their child below. I have never cared much for Diana becuase she didn't have the soul of the show like catherine did you can even tell the difference when vincent interacts with Diana. I will buy season 3 but I won't watch it, in fact I can barely get through the last three episodes of season two. I felt let down by the producers. In my opinion Ron Koslow needs to re-work this in a movie with the original characters and give us the ending the fans have always needed and to especially show that they could have that wonderful physical bliss that was always hinted at but never explored.",1197417600,13,797,4.391891891891892
3001139,2,B000XCZGX6,"I was one of the many fans who fought CBS to bring back this wonderful show. That old saying ""Be careful what you wish for"" sure came true in my opinion here. I will always feel betrayed by CBS, Ron Koslow the producer and the writers of this show. Better they had been truthful to those of us fighting that Linda Hamilton would not be returning and the show would be going in a completely new direction. The show was titled ""Beauty and the Beast"" and with the terribly painful killing of The Beauty the soul of this show and the reason for watching was lost to me.
I know there are many fans of third season. Enjoy but I cannot.
I still entertain some faint hope that this will come back someday as a movie with Vincent and Catherine. Hopefully with Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton before they are too old to play the roles, but perhaps with new actors if need be. I still feel like I need resolution to Catherine and Vincent timeless romance.",1197158400,27,943,4.333333333333333
3001140,5,B000XCZGX6,Season 3 gets a bum wrap. Season 3 is the whole reason I started watching B&B. I had not been a regular watcher of the show and my Mom had watched the previous seasons occasionally... but when Season 3 started... I decided to watch with Mom. The previous season recap along with my occasional watching of previous seasons put enough together for me to jump in the show. I loved the season opener... Though Lovers be Lost is one of the most tragic stories ever told... and so gut wrenching! As a die hard romantic... I couldn't help but be moved with the plight of Vincent and the search for his child. Gabriel was a brillant villain. So creepy and twisted... and even though this was full of dark stories... Diana and Vincent proved to be the light battling the immense forces of evil. It was great how Catherine's previous loves basicly unite in helping Vincent honor her. The care that was taken in dealing with her death and her memory... made me want to go back and rewatch the previous seasons... which I did once it made it onto cable. Having seen them all... I have to say as a whole... Season 3 was an exciting and well written mystery... gaining the clues as to how to find Gabriel. Diana became Vincent's protector as he was once Catherine's... an interesting shift.,1196985600,9,1276,4.504310344827586
3001141,2,B000XCZGX6,"Of course, like everyone else, I am still waiting for the thris season to come out on DVD. (Yes, I plan to buy it even though I am only giving it two stars), but I feel I can still offer a review of this season because I've never quite gotten over the disappointment. I hated what the writers did to the romance of Catherine and Vincent; I could never understand why they lost their bond after they made love. I'm hoping that by viewing the episodes back to back without commercial interuption the reasoning behind that plot development might be clearer (although I must admit to being doubtful on that point). I wish they they would have simply recast the role of Catherine and ended the plot on a much higher note.

I think they could have put the woman they cast as Diana in Catherine's role. She had a luminous beauty and a subtelty and sensitivity that Hamilton's often lacked during the series due to her struggles with drug addiction. (I know a lot of fans will hate me for mentioning her addiction but she has admitted that she had a problem and admire her for taking action to get her life back on track).

Because of the way Catherine and Vincent's bond was severed by their intimacy, the cruel way in which they were separated and unable to be togther and enjoy the pregnancy and birth of their son, and the cold harsh way Catherine's life ended, I can only give this season a two-star rating.",1196726400,9,1404,4.437984496124031
3001142,1,B000XCZGX6,"In my opinion, season 3 isn't worth the money and it will ruin the joy of the first two seasons.  This season warped a beautiful show into a depressing, ""action"" farce with too much angst and not enough of the concepts the first two seasons embraced - compassion, wonder, family, justice, and love.  If you're an old fan, its probably necessary to complete the set.  I'll probably buy it at some point so I can throw out my old tapes, but I won't watch it.  For new fans, I would simply recommend making up your own ending to season 2 (or enjoying one of the fine endings others have come up with over the years) and enjoying the show for what it was meant to be.",1196380800,16,663,4.238095238095238

3001144,3,B000XCZGX6,Season 3 was a painful one to watch BUT...if you're an avid fan of this wonderful TV show - you have to complete the series.  I agree with another reviewer who feels that CBS should have given fans a nice ending with the conclusion of season 2.  The success of the series was entirely based on the chemistry between Linda and Ron and the beautiful relationship between Catherine and Vincent.  It was stupid to think the show could go on without that.  CBS might have done better ending the series at season 2 and then perhaps doing a movie or two down the line if Linda and Ron agreed to that later on and perhaps they might have.,1196121600,10,630,4.313559322033898

He comes from a secret place, far below the city streets, hiding his face from strangers, safe from hate and harm. He brought me there to save my life. And now, wherever I go, he is with me in spirit. For we have a bond stronger than friendship or love. And although we cannot be together, we will never, ever be apart...

Creator Ron Koslow's updated version of the fairytale has a double focus: the relationship between Vincent,(a mythic, noble man-beast) and his Catherine (a savvy assistant DA in New York); and a secret Utopian community of social outcasts living in a wondrous world beneath the city a sanctuary where Vincent is protected and loved. Through an emotional bond connecting Vincent to Catherine, he is able to sense the dangers her job brings her, and he comes to be her protector as well as the man she loves beyond all measure. The series follows the developing relationship between these two and nicely fleshes out the underground world of labyrinth tunnels, mystical waterfalls, and people who have come together to form a loving and nurturing family. In a twist from the original tale, however, this ""beast"" does not transform into society's idea of beauty after gaining the love of Catherine. Rather, Vincent's inner beauty is allowed to remain the focus of who he is and it is Catherine's former ""shallow"" self that is the ugliness transformed by their love of each other

3001146,1,B000XCZGX6,"This season was a case where CBS totally ruined a beautiful story and betrayed the fans who loved and fought for this show. If Linda Hamilton wanted to leave the show, I feel the network should have AND could have wrapped the series up in a way that was satifactory to all involved or re-cast the role of Catherine instead of the lunacy produced this last season beginning with Catherine's death. There was nothing wrong with the character of Diana, it mattered little that she wasn't Catherine and that is not the reason she wasn't accepted.  It was the utter LUNACY CBS foisted on us with Catherine's death.  I applaud CBS for FINALLY giving us season 1 & 2 on DVD...finally I can revisit this beautiful and romantic show anytime I please. And while I will buy season 3 as it IS Beuaty and The Beast, I have no plans to actually WATCH it.  I will NEVER forgive what was done to the characters I love in season 3.

I don't remember disliking Diana. As an audience, we weren't given much to work with where she was concerned. And it didn't help that she wasn't ""Catherine.""

What I do remember, vividly, is the relationship that developed between Vincent and Elliot Burch. For me, the third season was wonderful and wonderous because it showed love enduring. Both men loved Catherine and Catherine loved both of them -- though Burch's feet of clay prevented her from having a deeper relationship with him. (The first season episode where he's introduced even has Vincent acknowledging that Catherine is falling in love with Burch, so please don't think I'm being heretical.)

Seeing how loving Catherine changed Burch and made it possible for Vincent, and, to a lesser extent Joe Malone, to work with him was for me the ultimate affirmation of the value and purpose of love.

All the men who loved Catherine, forged a bond through her. It was lovely to watch, and I can't wait to own the third season.",1195257600,60,1208,4.683962264150943

It is done with as much quality as the rest of the show, even if it does have a bit of a surreal feeling sometimes (as if the whole thing was a very long, very bad dream). Walk Slowly, the second episode, remains the most tragically beautiful thing I've ever seen on a tv show. Diana was a great character, though the writers try to force the beginnings of a new romance with Vincent, and it's just ridiculously too soon for that.

The first two seasons introduced us to a world of wonderful characters.  We grew fond of them and loved them all, for various reasons, but especially Vincent and Catherine.

Then tragedy struck and everything changed.  The world was no longer as safe as it had been with the Beast protecting Beauty.  Now it was a vital search for their legacy with a new and different Beauty.

Season 3 is not everyone's cup of tea but, once I'd gotten over the shock, I came to appreciate it.  It was as close to real life as this show would ever come - bad things happen to good people for no rhyme or reason and the strength of their character shows through in how they deal with adversity.

And adversity there was in plenty - with Gabriel, one of the most urbanely evil portrayals I have ever seen, having stolen the legacy and the original Beauty in the first place; through the perils of addiction; the memorable Snow; uneasy associations with all of the men who loved Catherine; and the growing knowledge that love endures in many forms.

This was a fantastic show.  The 3rd season is not what I would have originally wished for and brought me to tears by the end of the two-part opening but, like Vincent, I learned there was more to life and love.  This shortened season, with its major villain and a story arc to tie it all together became compulsive viewing.

3235390,1,B000XCZGX6,"I give the show 5 stars but for the DVD product I am downgrading my rating and I have allowed plenty of positive ratings to be added before my Season 4 Review so it doesn't damage the product's rating but should be found in the critical review of this show as a major fan complaint.  It has been 4 years since I complained about the lack of a Blu-ray release for this series in 2012.

Aside from ""Arrow"", this was the other show at the time that was also broadcasted on the CW nework in 1080i HD and in 5.1 surround sound that peaked my interest in their network when it first aired.

Unfortunately, it baffles me why ""Arrow"" has a Blu-ray / DVD release and yet ""Beauty and the Beast"" Season 1, 2, 3 and the 4th and Final Season ""STILL"" have not received their Blu-ray release. Was it to not confuse customers from the Disney Blu-ray release? I doubt it and people can distinguish box covers from animation and the real deal. I think fans and customers should let CW know that we want a Blu-ray version of their show either in a single season release or an exclusive BOXED SET BLU-RAY release with extras.

Most shows released today are dual format released or Blu-ray / DVD combo packages. People who have not seen the show in HD TV will probably not know what they are missing in terms of picture and sound quality which draw you into the story more.  One person commented they saW an episode on Youtube and thought the DVD version was just as good.  Most Youtube videos are SD in quality so that doesn't surprise me.  If they saw it on the air in 1080i HD quality they would be unimpressed with the Youtube video.  If this show had only been broadcast in SD like DVD quality it would have not engaged me as much at the time as seeing the characters sharp and alive alongside with the 5.1 audio track added another level to the show that no Youtube or Standard Definition DVD could compare.

Bring out the Blu-ray release of this wonderful show for Season 1, 2, 3, and the 4th and Final Season for your wonderful fans.

Don't make this into another DVD only release since Season 1 and then vanish off the air leaving us with this second rate quality nostalgia. This show deserves more respect and the crew who painstakingly spent the time on making this show deserve it to be seen in the best picture and sound quality as it originally aired on the CW network in 1080i and 5.1 audio.  Make this a true 1080P 7.1 audio DTS release so this show will look and sound even better than on the original HD broadcast.

Anyone with me on this voice your opinion below and let them know unless you want to be stuck with pathetic low quality Standard Definition low quality replica of the original show that shined and sounded!  Don't let this show be another one of those cancelled shows that will only let you relive in nostalgia in second rate quality.  I still got my DVRed 1080i High Definition recordings but I would definitely buy a Complete 4 Seasons Blu-ray Boxed Set with Extras.  If this continues without a Blu-ray release you will start seeing people stop buying DVDs and holding out because they pale in comparison to what you truly could have given them.  In 10 years you'll see old DVR HD recordings popping up on Youtube and the internet because they crave for the best quality of the show that you gave them on the TV screen but didn't fulfill in their home.

If you're truly a fan of this show voice your comment below and with enough comments maybe they will finally listen and give us what we truly want.

I recall asking for a Closed Captioning on an old TV series called ""Sledge Hammer"".  I left a comment on a website ages ago asking that the second season include it.  Surprisingly one of the guys involved with the production of the show told Alan Spencer about it and I got an email saying he would add it into the second season and that is why only the Second Season of Sledge Hammer has closed captioning and not the first.  Although they did release the two seasons as a Complete Series I haven't checked whether they added it to the first season in the Complete Series release as I only bought the individual original seasons release.  So you never know who is listening and watching these reviews but I was a nobody leaving a comment and Alan Spencer got it done which impressed me.

Hopefully those same ears might be around for this show... :)",1481414400,,4368,4.4054726368159205

3235418,4,B000XCZGX6,"When I bought this series on dvd many years ago, I was swept away in this show. I remembered when it aired, Catherine (Linda Hamilton) was not continuing with the show. I recently read that she was pregnant at the time and didn't want to continue with a baby on the way. Most shows would either replace her character or end the series there. I didn't want to see how they ended her character so I never bought the 3rd season. I guess I forgot because I recently pulled out the 1st season while on vacation and once again was swept away in this epic love story! Then came season 2 and not happy with being left hanging, I searched my collection for season 3 when I remembered I never bought it. It turns out my sister had the entire collection and I borrowed her 3rd season - I loved it! I loved Diana (who could never replace Catherine) but was compelling and critical to Vincent's success at finding his son. The creepy man who took Vincent's son was nothing short of vile and brilliant and Snow - another great character made the show just as enjoyable. Season 3 could never top the heart-warming, deep love experienced by Vincent and Catherine that made this show great but it made me want to keep watching to see the inevitable rescue of Vincent's son! So now, I have just purchased Season 3 to conclude this wonderful must-have collection! I highly recommend it!",1462060800,,1367,4.472

3235423,3,B000XCZGX6,"Spoilers ahead, you have been warned!!  I love this series so much.  Season 1 and 2 were fantastic but sadly Linda Hamilton wanted to leave the show because of her pregnancy and that she felt her character was not being developed enough to make it worth staying on.  Take away a main character like that, in which the whole series is based around, means nothing but failure.  Trying to introduce a new love interest like Diana just doesn't work in a fairytale, no matter how dark this version is. They also mixed up a few episodes at the end and for some reason Prime is not showing the very last episode, Episode 12 titled Legacies. It is part 2 and the finale is described as ""Upon returning to ""The World Below"" upon the knowledge of some of ex-tunnel inhabitants being murdered, Father encounters Gregory Coyle who seeks revenge for the death of his father by cave-in 20 years ago. Diana makes it her mission to catch Gregory before he can kill another ex-inhabitant of ""The World Below.""  I remember watching this when it first aired.  At any rate, I prefer to end the series at the original naming ceremony in episode 9, Invictus, where Vincent's son is safe below, being named and a little clip of Catherine with tears in her eyes is looking down on them, like the angel she now is.  Also Walk Slowly, as heartbreaking as it is, is my favourite episode of this season.  Once you get over the sadness of this season, just go back to the beginning and watch Season 1 again and make up a happier ending for them all. That is what I do!  :)",1456012800,4,1543,4.424028268551237

The episode about Lover lost impacted us and I never will forget that episode. We were shocked and stunned. But the message of death having no dominion was clear a powerful.

And even when the new actors were good, season 3 didn't follow the passion, the sophistication, the music and the poetry the series had in the begining.  And the way they kill Catherine's character was to awful and cruel. She was tortured to death when she was pregnant. Kill a main character like Cathy was a big risk and in the end cost the series to end because the baby wasn't enough. I know LH wanted to leave, even so I was prefer that they maintain the character alive and just change the actress, maybe the series cancel anyway but Cathy would stay alive.

Moonlight ended with a closed door, I won't launch a spoiler.....It's just that we craved more......and the powers that be just didn't respond.

I vaguely remember the back and forth of Linda Hamilton leaving the series.....and the upheaval it caused.  I had remembered how the viewers rallied to get the show back on.  I was one of them begging for more Vincent and Catherine.

I hadn't remembered how much the transition changed the dynamics.

Yes, we got to see more action, more angst (a trademark of the Koslow shows) and we got to meet Diana, a woman who thru the mechanics of the costume department seemed to be more of a Tunnel woman than Catherine.  Diana appears to blend right in with her long french braided hair, natural glow and layers of loose clothing.....Did they do that on purpose???

They could have really went with this show if all of us die hard Cathrine Chandler fans would have given it a chance.

3235573,3,B000XCZGX6,"Note: This review contains spoilers. Anyone who was a fan of this series will want to have this season in their collection. After all, a collection isn't a collection unless it's complete. Having said that however, the choices made by the writers and producers of ""Beauty and the Beast"" were poor. This story--at its core--is a fairytale. Fairytales must have happy endings, or they're not fairytales. It wasn't worth twelve rather unsatisfying episodes to compromise the integrity of the fairytale genre. It would have been much more rewarding--and honest--to have ended the series with Catherine realizing that she had done all she had set out to do in the world above--and joyfully accepting that her future would properly be spent with Vincent, and their son, in the world below. Having Vincent lose his empathic connection with Catherine was a big mistake, since that bond is the entire premise on which their relationship was based. Killing off Catherine was, of course, the ultimate error--because it simply is not the way a ""true"" fairytale should end. Season III, in and of itself, isn't wholly ""bad"" television, but it is mediocre. It actually contains some fine moments, particularly for some of the secondary and recurring guest characters (such as Joe Maxwell and Elliot Burch, respectively). In addition, unlike some other reviewers, I found the character of Diana quite interesting, primarily because what she and Vincent develop is a friendship. It could not possibly be more. However, the evil characters in this season were silly and boring--and too much time was spent on them. The season would have redeemed itself far better if they had spent more time on a more romantic storyline, since the whole series was intended to be a romance. For example, they could have focused on Joe's coming to terms with the love he felt for (but never expressed to) Catherine--AND they could have developed a meeting/friendship between Joe and Vincent. (After all, the love Joe felt for Catherine was far less selfish than what Elliot felt for her.) Or, they might have pursued a romantic interest developing between Joe and Diana--perhaps even with Vincent's help. Joe Maxwell, in particular, was a wonderful character who was left wholly unresolved in the series, and that is unfortunate. Although I still believe the third season never should have happened--there are ways in which it could have been better.",1256342400,4,2415,5.101010101010101

3235588,3,B000XCZGX6,"As a lover of romantic storylines, this was is, by far, my favorite. I enjoyed the relationship between the contemporary beauty Catherine Chandler and the regal beast Vincent. Theirs was a love that has made most love stories pale in comparison and one I will not forget. It seemed as if it would continue.

But all of this changes when tragedy occurs and Vincent finds himself alone. Overcome by grief, Vincent lashes out at anyone who tries to get too close, but must become strong again when he discovers he and Catherine's child has been taken by an evil drug lord named Gabriel, who sees the child as ""a perfect creation."" While Vincent employs the aid of Catherine's former flame, former tycoon Elliot Burch, to save his son, the lines between justice and revenge, good and evil blur into one. The arrival of a detective named Diana will move the ball forward to the conclusion.

 I was devastated by Catherine's death and Vincent's grief.  Ron Perlman was able to communicate the depths of Vincent's emotions to a deep level, one which carried itself off the screen and into my heart. The following determination to find his and Catherine's child is what keeps him motivated to live, and what will eventually be the thing that puts him at peace.

My reason for the three stars is for this: after a while Vincent's quest to save his son began to feel like it was being stretched out. I know it sounds petty but there were times when I began to question the storyline. Gabriel the drug lord is designed as this menacing genius who can elude the higher powers, but after a few episodes they turn him into a philosophical clown. The presence of Diana, while an interesting facet into the secrets of the mole peoples' existence and her desire to solve Catherine's case, seemed convoluted and forced. Are we to believe that she can easily earn the trust and possible love of Vincent and his family? We're told we can, but this happens quickly and without question.

It's not perfect, but it's still worth seeing, and even though I didn't particularly enjoy the way it ended, it brought me to tears, so I know it still held that power.",1242604800,3,2135,4.634920634920635

As romantic as Catherine/Vincent was, I think Diana has the backbone needed to stand up to Vincent and eventually tell him to get over himself in regards to his Byronic Hero tendencies, i.e. his ""we can't be together because of what I am, oh woe is me"" drivel.  It might have been romantic when I was a teenager, but in my thirties, I have quickly gotten over it.

As a kid growing up under difficult circumstances, this show opened my eyes to the possibility of being more than I ever thought I could be. Corny as it may be - I believe this show made me a better person. With that said, it has taken me 18 years to come to terms with the death of Catherine Chandler. LOL. I was one who wrote in to CBS trying to ""save the show,"" and when Linda Hamilton left, and Catherine died, my teenage psyche was too young to handle her loss. Had I known - I probably would have preferred a really good ""happily ever-after"" tv movie to wrap up the show.

Now as a woman - I was finally able to watch the last 12 episodes and come to terms with the changes in the show. (Yes, I am aware this is fiction!) Obviously, the tone of BATB changed with the loss of Catherine, but her presence was always underlying. Overall I enjoyed watching the final 12 shows, independent of the first two seasons.

Fans would not have accepted a new Fox Mulder and the X Files without him truly lost its formerly brilliant way.

But I do not feel this was true with ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Although, like everyeone, I loved the special romance of our favorite beast man and Catherine, there really wasn't an undending array of story lines that the romance could have realistically sustained. (I have heard series writer/producer confess to this very difficulty.)The writers had already explored many of the problems that Catherine and Vincent's impossible affair created.  Where could they have taken it in the long haul?  Add that to the fact that their lead actress pulled out and they faced an interesting situation: Let the show die forever or continue to explore the ramifications of a Vincent tormented by the loss of Catherine.

I for one was far more attracted to the show because of Vincent than I ever was for Catherine.  He was its heart and soul, his poetic and haunted character the reason I tuned in every week.  I did not want to lose him, even without his beauty.  Ron Perlman was simply wonderful in the role of a lifetime.  I was perfectly willing to watch what might become of him in light of his tragedy.  Like others, I was deeply touched by the bonds between Elliot Burch (always a plus on the show) and Joe and Vincent in their united fight against the man who murdered the woman they all loved.  And Gabriel was a delicious villain. (Gabriels seem to make splendid villains, as any Dorothy Dunnett fan can attest.)

I for one really liked Diana! I thought she had grit and integrity. I also think that falling in love with someone who was himself grieving for the loss of the love of his life was itself high romance and I really felt for her plight.  I would not have wanted a romance to blossom too quickly, but to me, her love for him (we all loved him; why shouldn't the new chick?) and his struggle to be loyal to his memories of Catherine and yet try to find happiness in a world without her were far more intriguing possibilities that what the writers were facing with Vincent and Catherine alone.

I didn't like having the baby around.  Never a good idea.  But I commend everyone associated with the third season for a handful of episodes with high drama, passion, poignancy and, most of all, their gallant attempt to keep Vincent in my life.  Those of you who thrive only on the bright and lovely side of a great love may not find season three to be your cup of tea. But the rest of you, drink up!

3235616,1,B000XCZGX6,"Warning #1: YES--THERE ARE SPOILERS.  Warning #2: Thinkers only beyond this point.
Saying that the third season of CBS's Beauty and the Beast is just a different direction for the same show is like saying that The Little Mermaid (either Disney's OR Hans Christian Andersons) would be the same, um, tale if the Prince served the little mermaid as the entree at his wedding feast.  What happened in third season made everything that happened before it a lie.  This once-lovely series hits an all-time network television low (which is really, REALLY difficult) in showing the torture and murder of a pregnant woman (must have been trying to appeal to terrorists) and making what THEY had loudly touted as a once-in-a-lifetime love a flavor-of-the-season.  If you don't believe (or won't believe) that love--real once-in-a-lifetime, once-and-forever love can exist in the modern world, then you just wouldn't (couldn't) GET what the first two seasons were about.  Catherine Chandler wasn't Vincent's current squeeze--she was his one-and-only-EVER soul-mate.  Until, of course, they decided that--men being fickle and all--Vincent could find a palatable substitute in any female that happened by.  If you can get beyond that--and most of the real fans DID NOT--then you have to watch Father undergo a complete personality change.  While once the brave and self-sacrificing patriarch of the Tunnel World who swore that it was possible to love an entire lifetime in just a few short days, Father, too, finds it possible to take up with some random woman and abandon all his ideals AND his responsibilities while he whines that he has a right to be happy.  And if you were able to stand THAT, then you got to watch the safe haven so painstakingly crafted from the love and protectiveness of thousands of city helpers ripped open and destroyed.  Same story?  ""Slight"" differences?  I don't think so.  But if you insist on watching this horrible travestry (which is beautifully filmed and mostly well-acted by the members of the cast who actually COULD act), you at least have the advantage of knowing the outcome beforehand.  Most of us who watched this terrible, flinch-inducing horror did it ONLY because we had been led to hope that there would be a happy ending after all.  We were shamefully betrayed, and in such a way as to make it obvious that those leading us gleefully down the primrose path with promises of happily ever after only meant ""happily for them.""  That EXACT plot line is currently running on Ron Koslow's latest CBS show (a SHOCKING display of originality) and will no doubt ultimately result in the same sort of flip dismissal of the hopes and dreams of those fans.  Claiming to like the third season of this show after loving the first two seasons is sortof like saying, ""I like to pet puppies.  But I also like to eat them.""  Truth be told, however, most viewers simply aren't that discriminating.  As long as there is something chasing something on the screen, and some violence and the possibility that someone might get to grope something eventually, most viewers will settle back--unthinking and uninterested in doing so.  If you wish to join them, feel free to pay twice the price for half the shows--and none of the value.

I'm not done with the season yet, but I give this show 5 stars still because like they say:

3235624,5,B000XCZGX6,"Ever season of Beauty and the Beast has woven its spell around me a different way. In the first season, we learn of the development of Catherine and Vincent's relationship, as well as being introduced to the wonderful people Below. In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trials and tribulations they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons.

The third season, in my opinion, is what really shines out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arcs completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best as Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what makes people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met.

You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell gets a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times. New character Diana certainly does NOT take Catherine's place, and her and Vincen't relationship is far from being a romantic one. I have read in places that she seems to have some sort of paranormal powers, but I have not seen that in the episodes I have watched so far. She seems to have excellent insticts and investigative skills.

Now the character Gabriel, man I love to hate this guy. He's just pure evil incarnate. You can tell that Vincent's son is sensitive to him, because every time Gabriel is in the room it seems the child gets distressed.

A couple plot elements have gotten me a little confused so far, but it is negligible at this point, and I am hoping is cleared up by the time I watch the last episode.",1203292800,13,1670,4.6127946127946124

3235626,4,B000XCZGX6,"This show is one of those shows that has been with me virtually all my life. I remember watching Catherine fall dead into Vincent's arms and crying my eyes out when I was 9 years old. The emotional impact, though somewhat lost on me at the time, so stuck in my consciousness that I actually bought the VHS tapes, 2 episodes at a time, when they were being released that way, 10 years ago. But I purposefully avoided watching anything after ""Though Lovers Be Lost"". I assumed it would just be too painful.

In recent months, to my shock, I discovered that the DVDs were available, and bought seasons 1 and 2 and began watching them again. As an adult, the power and poigniency of this show hit me like a ton of bricks to a degree that it had never, before.

But, again, I was planning to avoid the third season this time too, save for ""Though Lovers Be Lost"" which I still had on VHS and is essential for at least a meager amount of closure. But the sense of loss and grief I felt when I finished watching it this time around was crushing.

After a few months of recuperating from her death, I decided that maybe I should give season 3 a chance. Which is what I am doing right this moment.

And here's what I've decided about the third season so far:

1)Thank God there was a 3rd season. I can only imagine how much it would have sucked if Linda Hamilton's leaving had left the show hanging entirely. I have had that experience with shows I loved far too many times.

2)Thank God they brought in Diana Bennet rather than trying to replace Catherine with a different actress. Not that I think they would have done that but it has been known to happen.

3)The fact of Catherine's death, though miserably sad, actually heightens the emotional punch of this love story. I mean, how boring would Romeo and Juliet be if nobody died?

4)At the end of ""Though Lovers Be Lost"", this most recent go around, I found myself just unbearably sad and kind of let down. Not remembering all the explicit details, I was surprised that Vincent didn't have more of a reaction to her death. More like the reaction she had, earlier in the episode, when she thought he was dying. It just seemed flat.

When I decided to give season 3 the benefit of the doubt, however, I found myself startled to realize that the second episode was EXACTLY what I had wanting from that story. It was a gem I was not expecting to find - a full episode that included a beautiful and well composed montage set to their beautiful theme song, a few more precious moments with Catherine (though she was dead), an actual kiss (though she was dead for that also) and 45 minutes of vincent weeping with grief and the sorrow of love cut short. Now THAT was worth spending the money on!",1202688000,17,2734,4.3767258382643
3235627,2,B000XCZGX6,"I still have all the VHS tapes I personally recorded of the show, on VHF, when they first aired on TV, so I have been watching those throughout these years and am thrilled that it's all on DVD now, even though this season was shortened and shortchanged. However, I am annoyed at whoever created the package for this 3rd season, as people who have just discovered the show will be very disappointed if they expect to see  exactly what is promised on the packaging itself. Linda Hamilton only appears in the very first 2 episodes of the final season. The package back, in very small print, states ""Some episodes May be edited from their original network versions"". If you saw the very first original TV Broadcasts, and compare things taped directly at that time with these DVD's, then you will see that things on the this DVD version (and on VHS versions SOLD before this) have been changed about here and there. Whether you do or don't like the packing people mucking about with the true original airings is a personal thing. People should just be aware that these dvd's have been edited/changed a bit here and there and should be forewarned that they are not what was originally aired on TV.",1202428800,5,1191,4.617924528301887
3235628,4,B000XCZGX6,"The 3rd season of Beauty and the Beast definitely takes the series in a very different direction.  As the new opening reveals, once Vincent gets past Catherine's murder he will dedicate his life to avenging injustice - in other words, he has been recast here as a sort of beastly Batman, searching the skies for the Beast Signal which will let him know that his services are needed.  Much of the first five or six episodes are focused more on the gritty world Above than on Vincent's world in the tunnels - the photography is very different, with a sharper, darker overcast (much of the warmth associated with the tunnel worlds is lost). Additionally, character inconsistencies (especially with Roy Dotrice's ""Father"") undermine the overall fabric of the story for those of us who followed it closely the first two seasons.  This is a much more violent show now, and it's much more ""black and white.""  The new villain, Gabriel, who dominates many of the episodes, is simply evil personified - there is no development of his character, no understanding of his motivations.  He is simply evil, and Vincent becomes the force of good which will win in the end.  Gabriel is Paracelsus without the poetry, without the history that made his demonic persona work.  There was always a hint with Paracelsus that what he really wanted was to be part of the tunnel community again, but he just couldn't figure out a way to do it.  The only thing we know about Gabriel is that he's a monster.

Catherine's death itself is not what changed this series - actually, Diana's character could very easily have become a new ""Beauty"" for Vincent, had the relationship been given a chance to develop.  The problem is the new tone, the darker perspective, the shift away from the tunnel community that had dominated the second season, and the fans' resistance to anything that even suggested that Vincent could move beyond his bond with Catherine and love another woman.  The message of the first two seasons is clearly the power of love to conquer hate and fear; this would imply that Catherine's love for Vincent SHOULD enable him to love again - after all, that's what he always told her about the nature of love.  Here, in Season Three, Vincent's grief is palpable, and Ron Perlman does an amazing job demonstrating what it is to feel loss.  But there are subtle moments between him and Diana that are hopeful and beautiful - and I, as a fan of the series, find solace in such hope.

While watching the first episode (Though Lovers be Lost) is not easy, know that there are things beyond it of great value.  Elliot Burch's character, especially, is given both a chance to redeem himself and chance to give Catherine a beautiful gift.  Diana becomes a fascinating and original character whose own connection to Vincent is believable and real - she is not Catherine, but rather an independent and introspective woman who may have much more in common with Vincent spiritually than Catherine ever did.  It would be so easy to see Diana becoming a part of Vincent's world.  So, suffer through the difficult death and grieving scenes, be prepared for the shift in focus, but enjoy the new stories being told here about Vincent and the two worlds in which he lives.  Yes, it's flawed - but there is still enough beauty to justify a return visit.",1202428800,56,3319,4.720970537261699

Yes, as an obsessed fan I was devastated by what occurred but the writing continued to be excellent and actually pretty clever I thought.  I wish though that they had completed a full third season; it would have been interesting to see what they would have come up with.

The show turned into quite a different animal (no pun intended), discarding much of its bland, mushy romanticism for a much more real romantic, epic feel and a sense of mythology. Stephen McHattie great turn as Vincent's archnemesis served the story well and gave it a strong, compelling focus that it was sorely lacking.

The third season of Beauty and the Beast offers some of the most dramatic and well-written television that has ever aired. The acting was superb. Once you begin watching, you will be riveted.

Jo Anderson as Diana is lovely, brave and poignant...desperately in love, before she ever meets him, with a man who may never love her. Ron Perlman as Vincent is even more incredible than he was in the first two seasons. They compliment once another beautifully.

Does third season get a bad rap? Yes. But see for yourself and watch it.

Looking at Beauty and the Beast as a whole story is, to my mind, essential to come to appreciate the vast range of emotion and depth of perception the series portrays.

To watch this show over twenty years later is to fall backwards in time and re-experience the magic. Watch the show all the way through...again. And if you've never seen it, don't miss it this time!

3235633,5,B000XCZGX6,"I am very passionate about the 1980s television series, ""Beauty and the Beast.""  The Third Season DVDs are just as beautifully digitally remastered as the first and second seasons were.  Masterful acting by the two main stars of the series, Ron Perlman, who plays Vincent (The Beast), and Linda Hamilton, who plays Catherine Chandler (Beauty), continues in the third and final chapter of this poignant series.  This season of the series portrays the heartbreaking grief experienced by Vincent, the Beast who lives in caves and tunnels under the streets of New York City when the love of his life, Catherine Chandler, an investigative lawyer working in the District Attorney's office is kidnapped and murdered by an human monster.  It masterfully portrays how love is an eternal journey.  Now, please don't despair over the demise of the television series, because the story is not quite over!

Because of my love of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" I began writing a novel which is a sequel to this series in early July of 2007.  I completed and published it in May of 2008.  The title of my book is ""Love's Journey to Awakening--Beauty and the Beast--Happily Ever After.""  I wrote it under my pen name, Laurel Cain Haws, and my editor is Dr. Thayle K. Anderson, an English professor emeritus from Murray State University.  He is a trusted friend, and a colleague of my beloved late husband, Dr. Gary L. Haws, who was my ""Vincent.""

My book has a very specific target audience, those who loved this series starring Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton, and hated its premature demise with its tragic ending.  My book fixes that.  It doesn't change the ending.  It begins where the series ends and changes the outcome, so it has an happy ending and perhaps a new beginning for more stories about these beloved characters.

If that idea appeals to you, it is essential that you watch all 3 seasons before reading my book.  Even if you saw them when they first aired 20-plus years ago, you really need to review and watch them again in order to fully understand and appreciate my book.  I never get tired of watching them, and I hope that you will enjoy seeing these characters come back to life with a new story line.

The questions from the series that my novel answers are:
1. Is Catherine Chandler (Beauty) really dead?
2. Where did Vincent (the Beast) really come from?
3. Can there be an happy ending to a modern day fairy tale that starts out, ""Once Upon a Time in the City of New York?""

My website link can be accessed at kandycain1587 ""My World"" on eBay or on my profile page on Amazon.  The timeline and characters are very precious to me, and I was very careful with them.

3235634,4,B000XCZGX6,"Note: This review contains SPOILERS.

This is an issue that has divided Beauty & The Beast fans for almost twenty years, and reading the reviews here, I can see a lot of people are still bitter. While the show certainly suffered the loss of Linda Hamilton, I personally found there was still plenty to enjoy in this abbreviated season.

For one thing, the season-long story arc served the show quite well. The second season's cliffhanger ending left a lot for the writers to explore. So much fuss was made way back in 1989 about the show being ""retooled"" to attract more male viewers. And I'll admit, there's probably a sizable portion of the potential male viewing audience that is attracted to the increased action and violence. But was the show really THAT different? We still have Ron Perlman and all the others giving it their all (and it was quite an emotional and yes, violent arc for Vincent). The late, talented Edward Albert got moved into a series regular slot. And I can't think of another series villain as vile as Stephen McHattie's Gabriel. And for you action fans, there's Lance Henriksen's appearance as the vicious assassin, Snow.

Even amid all the death and sorrow, there are moments of beauty. ""Walk Slowly,"" the follow-up to the 2-hour season premiere, is one of the best-written episodes of the entire series. Jo Anderson is no Linda Hamilton, but she evidences real concern and determination to help Vincent. And the return of Rolley (from season two's ""Chamber Music"") evokes sympathy, as well as reminds us that there was always more to this fictional universe than just Vincent and Catherine.

To the uninitiated who may not have seen this season: It's really not as bad as many people would have you believe. If you accept that Linda Hamilton only appears in 2 episodes, maybe that will lessen your potential disappointment. And if you've followed the story this far, it just makes sense to see it through to the end. No, it's NOT as good as the first two years. But it's still a great show, and I hope you will give it a chance.

The only other concern I have, as others have pointed out, is that the asking price for a shortened (12 episodes) season is the same as for a full season.  But as any true fan will tell you, it's something of a minor miracle that we're finally getting season 3 on home video in ANY format.  I'm grateful for that, and I have no hesitation in shelling out the $$ to complete my set.",1197936000,93,2440,4.608294930875576

I will buy season 3 but I won't watch it, in fact I can barely get through the last three episodes of season two. I felt let down by the producers.

The show was titled ""Beauty and the Beast"" and with the terribly painful killing of The Beauty the soul of this show and the reason for watching was lost to me.
I know there are many fans of third season. Enjoy but I cannot.
I still entertain some faint hope that this will come back someday as a movie with Vincent and Catherine. Hopefully with Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton before they are too old to play the roles, but perhaps with new actors if need be. I still feel like I need resolution to Catherine and Vincent timeless romance.",1197158400,27,943,4.333333333333333
3235637,5,B000XCZGX6,Season 3 gets a bum wrap. Season 3 is the whole reason I started watching B&B. I had not been a regular watcher of the show and my Mom had watched the previous seasons occasionally... but when Season 3 started... I decided to watch with Mom. The previous season recap along with my occasional watching of previous seasons put enough together for me to jump in the show. I loved the season opener... Though Lovers be Lost is one of the most tragic stories ever told... and so gut wrenching! As a die hard romantic... I couldn't help but be moved with the plight of Vincent and the search for his child. Gabriel was a brillant villain. So creepy and twisted... and even though this was full of dark stories... Diana and Vincent proved to be the light battling the immense forces of evil. It was great how Catherine's previous loves basicly unite in helping Vincent honor her. The care that was taken in dealing with her death and her memory... made me want to go back and rewatch the previous seasons... which I did once it made it onto cable. Having seen them all... I have to say as a whole... Season 3 was an exciting and well written mystery... gaining the clues as to how to find Gabriel. Diana became Vincent's protector as he was once Catherine's... an interesting shift.,1196985600,9,1276,4.504310344827586
3235638,2,B000XCZGX6,"Of course, like everyone else, I am still waiting for the thris season to come out on DVD. (Yes, I plan to buy it even though I am only giving it two stars), but I feel I can still offer a review of this season because I've never quite gotten over the disappointment. I hated what the writers did to the romance of Catherine and Vincent; I could never understand why they lost their bond after they made love. I'm hoping that by viewing the episodes back to back without commercial interuption the reasoning behind that plot development might be clearer (although I must admit to being doubtful on that point). I wish they they would have simply recast the role of Catherine and ended the plot on a much higher note.

I think they could have put the woman they cast as Diana in Catherine's role. She had a luminous beauty and a subtelty and sensitivity that Hamilton's often lacked during the series due to her struggles with drug addiction. (I know a lot of fans will hate me for mentioning her addiction but she has admitted that she had a problem and admire her for taking action to get her life back on track).

Because of the way Catherine and Vincent's bond was severed by their intimacy, the cruel way in which they were separated and unable to be togther and enjoy the pregnancy and birth of their son, and the cold harsh way Catherine's life ended, I can only give this season a two-star rating.",1196726400,9,1404,4.437984496124031
3235639,1,B000XCZGX6,"In my opinion, season 3 isn't worth the money and it will ruin the joy of the first two seasons.  This season warped a beautiful show into a depressing, ""action"" farce with too much angst and not enough of the concepts the first two seasons embraced - compassion, wonder, family, justice, and love.  If you're an old fan, its probably necessary to complete the set.  I'll probably buy it at some point so I can throw out my old tapes, but I won't watch it.  For new fans, I would simply recommend making up your own ending to season 2 (or enjoying one of the fine endings others have come up with over the years) and enjoying the show for what it was meant to be.",1196380800,16,663,4.238095238095238
3235640,4,B000XCZGX6,"3 DVDs is a little poor for 13 Episodes (if you count the 90-minutes-opener as 2 eps), that means, that they have to sqeeze at least on one of the discs 5 Episodes, which will lower the bitrate and picture-quality.. one star less for that :-(",1196208000,,242,4.282608695652174
3235641,3,B000XCZGX6,Season 3 was a painful one to watch BUT...if you're an avid fan of this wonderful TV show - you have to complete the series.  I agree with another reviewer who feels that CBS should have given fans a nice ending with the conclusion of season 2.  The success of the series was entirely based on the chemistry between Linda and Ron and the beautiful relationship between Catherine and Vincent.  It was stupid to think the show could go on without that.  CBS might have done better ending the series at season 2 and then perhaps doing a movie or two down the line if Linda and Ron agreed to that later on and perhaps they might have.,1196121600,10,630,4.313559322033898

It is her wiorld, her world apart from mine. Her name is Catherine. From the moment I saw her, she captured my heart, with her beauty, her warmth and her courage. I knew then, as I know now; she would change my life, forever....

He comes from a secret place, far below the city streets, hiding his face from strangers, safe from hate and harm. He brought me there to save my life. And now, wherever I go, he is with me in spirit. For we have a bond stronger than friendship or love. And although we cannot be together, we will never, ever be apart...

Creator Ron Koslow's updated version of the fairytale has a double focus: the relationship between Vincent,(a mythic, noble man-beast) and his Catherine (a savvy assistant DA in New York); and a secret Utopian community of social outcasts living in a wondrous world beneath the city a sanctuary where Vincent is protected and loved. Through an emotional bond connecting Vincent to Catherine, he is able to sense the dangers her job brings her, and he comes to be her protector as well as the man she loves beyond all measure. The series follows the developing relationship between these two and nicely fleshes out the underground world of labyrinth tunnels, mystical waterfalls, and people who have come together to form a loving and nurturing family. In a twist from the original tale, however, this ""beast"" does not transform into society's idea of beauty after gaining the love of Catherine. Rather, Vincent's inner beauty is allowed to remain the focus of who he is and it is Catherine's former ""shallow"" self that is the ugliness transformed by their love of each other

Beauty and the Beast (1987-1990) Linda Hamilton (Catherine) and Ron Perlman as ""Vincent"". Filled with romance, fantasy and most of all, TV''s romantic couple. Sit back and watch this home-made video which features songs and screen captures from the series and a special, suspense moment from the episode ""The Watcher"" (season Two)",1195689600,16,2372,5.6016713091922
3235643,1,B000XCZGX6,"This season was a case where CBS totally ruined a beautiful story and betrayed the fans who loved and fought for this show. If Linda Hamilton wanted to leave the show, I feel the network should have AND could have wrapped the series up in a way that was satifactory to all involved or re-cast the role of Catherine instead of the lunacy produced this last season beginning with Catherine's death. There was nothing wrong with the character of Diana, it mattered little that she wasn't Catherine and that is not the reason she wasn't accepted.  It was the utter LUNACY CBS foisted on us with Catherine's death.  I applaud CBS for FINALLY giving us season 1 & 2 on DVD...finally I can revisit this beautiful and romantic show anytime I please. And while I will buy season 3 as it IS Beuaty and The Beast, I have no plans to actually WATCH it.  I will NEVER forgive what was done to the characters I love in season 3. As far as I am concerned....season 3 NEVER happened and doesn't exist!",1195603200,14,985,4.430939226519337
3235644,4,B000XCZGX6,"When the second season of Beauty and the Beast ended, I was one of the many people who wrote to get the show renewed. I had never done anything like that before, but Beauty and the Beast was a show to be passionate about.

I don't remember disliking Diana. As an audience, we weren't given much to work with where she was concerned. And it didn't help that she wasn't ""Catherine.""

What I do remember, vividly, is the relationship that developed between Vincent and Elliot Burch. For me, the third season was wonderful and wonderous because it showed love enduring. Both men loved Catherine and Catherine loved both of them -- though Burch's feet of clay prevented her from having a deeper relationship with him. (The first season episode where he's introduced even has Vincent acknowledging that Catherine is falling in love with Burch, so please don't think I'm being heretical.)

Seeing how loving Catherine changed Burch and made it possible for Vincent, and, to a lesser extent Joe Malone, to work with him was for me the ultimate affirmation of the value and purpose of love.

All the men who loved Catherine, forged a bond through her. It was lovely to watch, and I can't wait to own the third season.",1195257600,60,1208,4.683962264150943

8227947,3,B000XCZGX6,"Linda Hamilton's role was a linchpin that held this series together. The show could not go own without her. They tried valiantly to continue after the actress departed but she was necessary.
I had heard that Katherine was killed off and a new character was brought it to fill the void. It wrankled me. I did not remember that from my younger viewing--perhaps I was part of America that gave up on the show.

Still, I wanted to watch it all. So, after Linda Hamilton's Katherine died off I kept watching. It was better than I expected. Sure, it needed to end but the new actress allowed Vincent time to morn and quest. It was a nice ending despite everything you've heard.",1502064000,,671,4.5

If they were going to end the series they should've just ended it with the baby naming get together. I really think this show is defiantly over due for a reboot though. I hope someone decides to reboot it soon because I think it would be cool to see it now 30 years later.,1500854400,,442,3.9775280898876404
