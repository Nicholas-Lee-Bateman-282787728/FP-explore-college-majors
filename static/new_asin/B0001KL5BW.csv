2012552,5,B0001KL5BW,"This 6-hour documentary made a huge splash in the mid-1980s when it first appeared.  By the end of the year Penguin had to reprint the Iliad twice, and the companion book became an international best seller.  At a time when the academic elite refused to accept there was any truth to the Trojan War stories, and that the mere attempt to find the reality behind the legends was a career-killer, Wood's documentary was a revelation.  And for me personally, it opened up a whole world and an undying interest in the Trojan War.  But, does it hold up today?  Is there any reason to sit down and watch this now?
Absolutley.  There is an incredible amount of information in this series.  The first two episodes focus on the discovery of Troy and the great archaeological digs there (and elsewhere around the Aegean).  The middle two episodes bring to life Homer's world, and more generally the era of the Trojan War.  The final two put forth his own ideas about whether or not there is any truth behind the stories, based on Hittite archives, archaeology, and a good deal of ancient detective work.  This is hands down the most comprehensive documentary on the Trojan War.
More important, though, is the *feel* of the series.  Woods follows in a long line of amateur historians who, unafraid of appearing ""undignified"" or upsetting their careers, scampers up ruined walls, asks interesting questions, and tells a darn good story.  He's just as comfortable interviewing academics, illiterate fishermen, or storytellers in smoke-filled Turkish bars.  Woods actually makes the past come alive, much more so than the standard ""voice over"" style of documentary.
As a final thought, this was a series way ahead of its time.  As mentioned, in the 80s the Trojan War was considered a myth pure and simple.  Woods went *way* out on a limb to uncover the truth of the Trojan War, and came up with some fascinating ideas.  They were promptly shot down by the establishment, but they did spark a new era of investigation of Troy.  As it stands now, most of the ""radical"" ideas are now accepted as fact, and it seems that Woods could have even pushed the envelope a bit further.
All in all this is an incredible series and an absolute must for anyone who has been fascinated with the Trojan War.  Sure it's long, but more than worth the time spent!",1085011200,6,2329,4.708641975308642
2012553,5,B0001KL5BW,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best historical documentaries ever made. In Search of the Trojan War combines archaeological adventure, historical investigation and a charming presentation by historian Michael Wood to bring to life one of the best known Greek legends: the Trojan War. Sifting through vast sources of information, from the ancient to the contemporary, visiting fabled cities, and walking on the footsteps of the people of times past Michael Wood discards speculation to present an objective view on the history of the city of Troy.
Made in 1987 by PBS and the BBC, this six-part documentary is still the most complete and vivid depiction of Troy ever presented in television. Each one of the original episodes deals with a particular topic regarding Troy and the Trojan War as explained below:
*The Age of Heroes: presents the many legends and myths of the ancient Greeks, where they came from, the ways they influenced everyday life, and how life ordinarily went on in the Greek world during this historical period.
*The Legend Under Siege: presents the pioneering men, both believers and skeptics, who followed Greek myths into their historical past, discovering legendary cities, awe-inspiring treasures and important cultural facts, and, in the process, creating the science of archaeology.
*The Singer of Tales: presents as detailed a biography on Homer as the information about him permits - including a pleasant and entertaining look at the very old and almost unchanged art of the bard poets - and a detailed analysis of his epic: The Iliad.
*The Women of Troy: traces the evidence that places Trojan women on Greek mainland as the probable result of their abduction by victorious Greeks after the War, giving strong historical support to Homer's tale.
*The Empire of Hittites: presents the commercial and political connections between the Trojans and the Hittites as recorded in Hittite clay tablets and other historical records, validating further Homer's account of the Trojan War.
*The Fall of Troy: presents the conclusions drawn from the historical facts about the reality of the Trojan War, its legend and its heroes.
Not only does this documentary include every bit of information you could ever hope to find about the city of Troy itself and its many legends, it also includes information on Greek writing systems and alphabets, other important Greek myths and legends, and the birth of archaeology. If you are a history buff looking for an archaeological armchair adventure, the Indiana Jones type at heart or simply searching for an entertaining way to brush-up on your Trojan history, buy this documentary. I assure you that you will love it.
I would recommend reading the documentary's companion book ""In Search of the Trojan War"" by Michael Wood for an excellent bibliography to fuel further personal research. The book also includes an updated chapter that presents discoveries made on this topic since 1984 and not included in the documentary, which will not only complement what you'll explore in it, but will also make the conclusions presented on its last episode seem more likely to be correct. Enjoy!

It was among my favorite documentaries and I'm glad to see it holds up well even after all these years. Michael Wood is a fabulous presenter who lets the documentary's subject be the star, not him.

2012607,2,B0001KL5BW,"Very disappointed in this presentation. Mr. Wood has taken one of the most magical, romantic stories

What Arthur Evans has to do with the story of Troy is very peripheral, yet Mr. Wood has chosen to spend an inordinate amount of time on Mr Evans, an academic I might add who made huge errors in judgement.
With all the focus on English academics and academia its a wonder the world of Homer and ancient Greece was touched on at all. After all this wasn't an English tale, its no Canterbury Tale...its a tale of Ancient Greece told by one of its bards. And it was so well told it has captured the imagination of the world like no other tale.
Mr. Wood might be surprised to know that there are Greek bards and musicians still alive today. There are archeologists working the ancient sites and there are Greek academics who have their own take on their own history.
Mr Wood reminds me of those other English academics who wrote the history of the native Americans - and got it completely wrong.",1423612800,,1144,4.558252427184466

2012610,5,B0001KL5BW,"In what is one of the best historical documentaries ever made, Michael Wood takes the viewer from Turkish Anatolia to Crete to the Peloponnese and back again searching for evidence of Western Civilization's first great epic - the Trojan War.

Historian Michael wood immerses the viewer in the ancient and long lost world of the Bronze Age. Searching for evidence of the Trojan War from Homer's Iliad, Wood takes the reader through the personalities such as Schliemann, Dorpfeld, Arthur Evans and the American Carl Blagen. We are led through the weapons, the pottery styles, the heroic culture of the time as well as the physical remains on Hisarlic (the hill these men believed was the site of Troy), Mycenae, Knossos, Hattusha of the Hittites and other sites.

The journey we embark upon with Wood is half the fun. We learn of the many layers of that hill and the very different cities that were constructed on it from very ancient times until Greek and Roman times. Really, I learned so much of Agamemnon and Paris as well as the empires of the day. This is an excellent documentary and I could see this DVD used in a high school class setting.

This is a great documentary that takes the time to cover the ground necessary to look at the place and times to give the viewer an excellent understanding of the search for Troy. Six roughly hour-long shows treat the subject matter in a thorough fashion. In spite of the length, you won't get tired of it.

The romance of history is as important as collating facts about history, and folk tales that tell ancient truths embedded in myth that tells us a tale of our often forgotten ancestors.

The music throughout the series is excellent and fits the theme of the series very well. The music hints at deep, sweet mysteries, things long buried and long past, distant memories of Golden Ages long gone.

In this series, which I think is, or should be, the benchmark for anyone making a series about any historical period or historical story, Michael Wood was truly `conquering new worlds for the imagination.'",1370304000,3,878,4.959183673469388

2012642,5,B0001KL5BW,"This six-part documentary, one of the first of Michael Wood's ""In Search of  .  .  . "" series, is an impressive tour de force that examines Bronze Age civilizations, what we know of the Trojan War, the oral history tradition about it embodied in the work of Homer, and the efforts to demonstrate the historicity of the war, especially through the archeological investigations of Heinrich Schliemann, Wilhelm Drpfeld, Arthur Evans, and Carl Blegen.

The legend of the Trojan War is fairly well known.  Helen (the most beautiful woman in the world), wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, either eloped with, or was abducted by, Paris, son of King Priam of Troy.  To recover her, various Greek city states assembled an allied force, under King Agamemnon of Mycenae, and sailed in fleet of 1,000 ships to attack Troy.  The siege of Troy lasted a decade, and was not concluded until a contingent of Greek soldiers, hidden in the Trojan Horse, gained access to the besieged city and opened its gates to their comrades.

Inspired by the story of the Trojan War, Michael Wood attempts to discover whether there is any reality behind the legend.  In his youth, Wood had been interested in drama.  He studied history at Oxford, but dropped out of a doctoral program before obtaining his degree in order to become a television reporter.  His ability to draw upon all of these experiences enhances the effectiveness of his documentary programs.

According to tradition, Homer's Troy lay somewhere under the Roman town of Ilium in what is now western Turkey.  But, as archeological digs would reveal, humans had occupied this site for 5,000 years, leaving, at different levels, the remains of nine principal cities, which could be further subdivided into 50 separate layers.  Could one of these previous settlements provide evidence that there had actually been a Trojan War?  If there had been such a war, when did it take place, who were the combatants, and what were their objectives?  Wood addresses these questions in these six episodes.

In the first episode, Wood focuses on the work of Heinrich Schliemann.  Schliemann was fascinated by the Trojan War; and he had the initiative and the wealth to conduct extensive excavations of the presumed site of Troy.  His work was based on careful analysis of relevant literary sources.  But archeology was in its infancy, and no one knew how to distinguish the Trojan War city from the cities on other levels of the site.  Thus, Schliemann burrowed down to the second city (Troy II), which he claimed was the city besieged by the Greeks.  Unfortunately, it eventually turned out to be the wrong city, dating from 1,000 years before the war.  Schliemann had in fact destroyed much of the city that he had spent 20 years and much of his fortune trying to find.  His life was a modern Greek tragedy.  The second episode traces the investigations of Wilhelm Drpfeld, who was able, on the basis of pottery evidence, to associate a more recent city (Troy VI) with the presumed period of the Trojan War.  It also describes how Arthur Evans (on Crete) and Carl Blegen (on mainland Greece) turned up clay tablets written in Linear B code, which proved that the Mediterranean cities of that time belonged to a single civilization.  Although it might more logically have belonged in the initial episode, Wood reserves his discussion of Homer and the transmission of historical traditions through oral history, until the third episode.  The fourth episode considers whether the quest for female slaves might have been one of the motives for the war, while the fifth episode describes the Hittite diplomatic archives and the possibility that the Trojan War was merely one aspect of a larger struggle between the Hittites and the Greeks.

In the sixth episode, Wood offers his tentative hypothesis regarding the Trojan War.  He suspects that there will never be a conclusive interpretation of the war, that each generation will continue to re-interpret the war in the light of its own experiences.  He concedes, ""I, perhaps, like all those who examined the question before me, have only found what I wanted to find.""  Nonetheless, he does reach some defensible conclusions, and judges some of the characters (such as Agamemnon) to have been real persons, while others were likely invented.  As for Helen herself, Wood remarks, ""In the archeological record, love leaves no trace.""  (With reference to Helen's role in the story, one of the scholars Wood interviewed said, ""I would not say that stranger things have not happened in the Near East."")

This documentary takes viewers to many of the historic sites involved, including Troy, Mycenae, Pylos, Knossos, and Boghaz Ky.  Wood guides us to relevant museums, and includes the assessments of leading scholars--even some who do not share his interpretations.  He is even-handed in his discussions of the archeologists, giving them credit for their accomplishments, while also pointing out what he believes to be their errors.  This is especially true of Schliemann, perhaps the most important of the archeologists, but a man who could not always be trusted.  Over 25 years have passed since this documentary was produced.  More recent research has told us more about Troy.  But most of Wood's conclusions are still valid.  This is an outstanding documentary.  Those interested in the subject should obtain the companion volume (of which there is an updated edition); it contains information not in the television version",1356566400,4,5487,5.009933774834437

2012673,4,B0001KL5BW,"A well made and interesting look at whether the Trojan War, as told in the Iliad by Homer, actually occurred. The story is expanded into the civilizations of the entire region, including those that came slightly before and after the presumed date of the war, about 1250 BC.

One of the more interesting aspects was the exploration of the diplomatic and strategic landscape of the region as reflected in the contemporary writings of the regional powers. Another was the attempt to find and visit some of the many ""cities"", what we today might call a fort or an armed outpost, mentioned by Homer to see whether they ever really existed and if the descriptions matches those told by Homer. All this in an attempt to discern whether the Iliad was a work of complete fiction or whether it was a retelling of an actual event and a description of actual places and actual peoples in the Bronze Age in the Aegean.

The series retraces the footsteps of archeologists and scholars of the modern era (beginning with Schliemann in about 1870) as they gathered successively more information about Troy and the Mycenaean world over a period of  more than a century.  It rounds the journey off, in the final episode, with some educated conjecturing on the likely end of the famous Greek and Trojan heroes, and of Troy herself.

Yes, it is long, and yes, much is conjectural, but that is the nature of interpretive archaeology. So what if it's dated? So are things from the Renaissance! I used this series for years in my secondary-school classroom and find it among the most inspirational documents I ever shared with my students. I don't quite understand Caraculiambro's discontent, and I am an arechaeologist. Could Michael Wood have done things differently? Of course, but to what effect? Making this a dry-as-dust review of all the material data? Could he magically have reached forward and fetched a contemporary computer? Does he oversell the romantic elements? Hardly. The Iliad is the foundation-rock of the Western romantic literary canon. Romance, adventure, deep understanding of human nature, it's all there. Readers should look up the traditional meaning of ""romantic"" to understand even more about Wood's presentation. Beyond that, Wood treats most things fairly, skeptically and thouroughly.

Wood even doubts whether traditional views of Homer are viable. So do I. I can vouch that this original bard was more than likely NOT ""blind"". Then where did this unprovable characterization come from? I submit that one need only to go to a museum with a goodly amount of classical, Renaissance and even 19th-century sculpture. You will see many of the statues with ""blank orbits""---i.e., lacking sculptural indications of irises or pupils. Thus Lorenzo the Great, Ben Franklin, Alexander, George Washington, etc. etc. all appear to have been ""blind""!

I don't see how anyone could add much to Volmar's viewpoint, and I would suggest that those inclined toward ancient romantic history both read Volmar's peerless review and buy the DVD before it disappears (again). I forget whether Wood mentions it or not, but in the Iliad, there is a scene wherein Priam gazes to the northwest and sees the islands of the nearby Imroz and distant Samothrace superimposed, like elements of a gunsight. This, as much as anything Schliemann, or subsequent archaeologists, did, marks the location of Troy. Was there a real war? Very likely. There is evidence of many wars on this site. Was it over the rape (abduction) or the elopement of a Mycenaean queen of legendary beauty? Who can ever know? I've yet to go to Troy, but I've stood under the Liongate, and that was the most incredible experience I had in all of my travels in Europe. I am not in the least reluctant to say that this thrill was greatly enhanced by my previous viewings of Wood's insight into the history of Mycenae, as presented in this thoroughly worthwhile history presentation.",1297555200,5,2700,5.078828828828829

2012680,5,B0001KL5BW,"Even though this was the first in search of book I read, I started the video series with ""In Search of Shakespeare"" (2003 TV series documentary). So you can imagine my surprise at seeing a young Michael Wood.  The technology is a hoot. However the lack of a better form of graphics and the either dull original recording or pour transfer can distract now and then from the message.

This series ""In Search of the Trojan War"" is quit extensive and they had to pack a lot of information into mere 6 episodes. Each episode is packed enough that you need to thank time to digest the information and look up peripheral matters before viewing the next.

Even though the series is a tad out of date you will not notice most of this and still have a lot to learn from what information there is.  I swear that even though I read several translations of the Iliad and took in recent movie that Michael Wood still found passages that I have missed somehow.

In any event your video library would be lacing without this presentation and you will find yourself periodically reviewing this series as a marathon.

The series does not say a lot about Michael and even his books seem to lack a good biography. I had to rely on Wikipedia for the most on his background and credentials.

It integrates Homer, the adventures of the archeologists, a travel-log of the narrator and documents from other cultures which thrived in the age of the Trojan war.  The pace is excellent and the conversations with the scholars are brief and well framed by the historical story.

Even considering that the video was done in the early 1980s (and there are a lot of stale cold-war references) it is completely worth watching and happily there is an interview with the narrator that helps bring it up to date.

2012694,4,B0001KL5BW,"At school I was bored to tears with the rubbish they made you 'appreciate'. Quite apart from the fact that from what I could see, if you were in a dumb class they might actually give you something cool to read, like the Hobbit or something, while we had to suffer through all sorts of allegedly award winning piffle someone on the school board thought kids might get into. Consequently, I became known amongst my group of friends for making it look like I had read the book due to my ability to waffle the waffle, so to speak.

But one good thing came out of this and that is that while steadfastly ingoring books they'd set me to read I was spending my time reading stuff like Herodotus and Homer. So many years later when I discovered the TV historian Michael Woods and his DVD on Alexander the Great I was very much at home. Discovering this earlier series of his was great news to me and I bought it without delay.

All up this is a good series for the arm chair historian. A few things you already knew, a couple of things you thought you knew and a regular snippets of what you didn't realise. Admittedly this is far drier a series than the Alexander the Great expose. The pacing is somewhat slow and the age of the thing does certainly hit you in the face when he's talking about going beyond the Iron Curtain, to a museum in East Berlin, to check out artifacts. Also the computer imagery used in some segments is humourously archaic looking. In fact I'm sure my nephew would barely recognise it as computer graphics, but hey, I'm old enough to remember playing games on my old Atari so for me it's something I can forgive.

The tangents Wood is most on about here is firstly to show actual continuity, looking at the sources to see how much of it is still around today. And he succeeds quite well.  He also takes some time discussing the story behind the Iliad and questions a number of historians regarding the Homeric action/romance/war story and trying to look at how much of it could possibly be true. Of course it's almost certain we'll never know and Woods leaves it at that, he doesn't go too far out on a limb.

As part of this DVD release Michael Wood gives a considered interview regarding this, only his second foray into TV history stardom. This marks him as a suitably self deprecating chap who while understanding why his chosen genre of TV history is not always appreciated by more mainstream historians he does set out his stall rather well. Especially since archeology ensuing since this series was made has largely backed up his conclusions.

While it has a slightly dated feel and isn't as good as his Alexander journey this is a useful product to pick up for the amateur history buff.",1254614400,3,2712,4.468686868686869

2012696,5,B0001KL5BW,"This is the most exhaustive, comprehensive investigation into the ""Troy question"" that I've ever been exposed to.  Did some conflict take place some 3,000+ years ago which prompted the legacy of the Trojan War myth?  Did it not?  Was there, in fact, a city known as Ilium / Troy?  Michael Wood explores the question from all possible angles.  While no definitive answers are to be found (I'll go ahead & divulge that much @ the get-go), it's still a fascinating inquiry into perhaps the single most famous & influential story in the western hemisphere.

Wood's journey takes us on a grand-tour of the Mediterranean basin, as well as to London & Berlin.  He invokes the talents of archeologists, philologists, historians and sundry Greek scholars in his search for the truth.  Many discussions take place as to how some of the data may support the historical veracity of a Trojan War, while other data does not.  Wood also investigates the phenomena of how some scholars have been guilty of fudging and /or ""reading into"" the data to see what they want to see.  It is difficult to be objective on this topic when one wants to take Homer at his word - even though the supposed war (if there was one?) took place 400-500 years prior to Homer's birth.

Some reviewers have complained that this series is long & drawn-out.  Well, yes, it is.  However, the scope of the question of what Wood is trying to grapple with is simply enormous.  An hour documentary would not have done the subject-matter justice.  With that in mind, I would recommend this DVD set ONLY to those who are fervently interested in the topic.  Those who have but a passing interest in the Trojan War are likely to lose interest after the first few hours.

I've often likened Michael Wood as the Carl Sagan of archeology.  This DVD set will likely go down as Wood's magnum-opus, and it explains why Wood is such a vital promoter of the archeology community.  So, if you want to know what REALLY happened (or didn't happen?) at an ancient city of Troy, this is a can't miss!",1235692800,,2038,4.626740947075209
2012697,2,B0001KL5BW,"This is a BBC documentary that came out in 1985.  It features British TV presenter Michael Wood tromping around Greece and Turkey attempting to unearth whatever factual roots may lie behind Homer's epic.  It's long -- more than 3 hours.

I think this documentary is a loser for three reasons.

1.  Forgive me, Michael, but it seems like the whole emphasis of this series was not so much in laying bare the historicity of the Trojan War, but on showcasing how romantic and adventurous YOU are.  (Or were.)  Was it really necessary for us to see you striding open-chested in a gale, poring over abstruse relics, climbing up craggy mountainsides, hobnobbing with Cambridge dons, mixing with the colorful locals, hopping about the European capitals, etc., etc.?  Couldn't your chest-hairs and tight jeans have been a bit less obtrusive?  Sheesh.  We get it already:  you're a sexy, well-educated, Indiana Jones-type.  I'm surprised the DVD issue didn't come with bonus still shots of you in the buff!

2.  I think the lion's share of the real work here had already been done by Schliemann, whose excavations in Asia Minor around 1870 largely revealed that, rather than having been wrought from whole cloth, Homer's war was evidently grounded on an actual siege - or at least battle - that occurred in about 1200 B.C.

Woods doesn't have much to add to his predecessors' work, yet he insists on elbowing in nonetheless, intent on saying something, anything.  Thus the series sees him harassing one expert after another with a line of questioning that seems fruitless and even childish:  ""But WAS there an actual Helen?  Did she ACTUALLY come from Mycenae?  Is THIS her face?  COULD a woman have caused a war?  MIGHT she have worn this brooch?  Did her mother REALLY do it with a duck?  Etc.

Worse, Wood seems less than forthright about the fact that even if he were to miraculously stumble upon a primary source stating explicitly that the Trojan War had been caused by a prince of Ilium running off with a Mycenaean queen, that still doesn't mean it would be true.  Ancient sources can get things wrong just as grossly as our modern media can.

And what whit of difference would it make one way or the other?  Somebody please tell me that.  It's as if Wood had been hired by Helen's family to settle a lawsuit or something.  He does a very poor job of explaining how his ""now really, seriously, really"" line of inquiry is of general relevance, given the much more useful insights that could be made with this material anent the utility of archaeology, the hegemony of poetry, or birth of Western civilization, etc.

3.  Most seriously, Wood's entire approach is outdated.  You can see it in the computer models he uses.  This entire thing needs to be re-done to incorporate new archaeological approaches that have been made possible by computers and DNA research.  In the field of Trojan archaeology, there have arisen new methods, new revelations, and even new lines of theoretical emphasis that pass utterly without mention, even in the DVD's ""bonus features,"" which are few.

This part isn't Wood's fault, of course, as he was using the best technology available at the time.  Still, watching his clunky computer simulations only makes you hunger for a proper re-do.

A comprehensive let-down.",1212796800,18,3293,4.836917562724015
2012698,5,B0001KL5BW,"I'm working on a Search Engine Optimization project for a new customer who sells reproduction 18K Gold jewelry from the ancient cultures of Anatolia, Greece and the Mediterranean basin.  I found this DVD set when searching online for source material for a ""Trojan War"" category of her reproduction jewelry from Mycenaean Greece and the Hittite Empire of the period.

I've always suspected that many of history's myths and legends have their basis in fact, and Michael Wood makes a convincing case for the hard reality underlying the tales of Troy and the war to recapture the beautiful Helen.  Watching the six hours of the production is easy to do, one segment leads effortlessly into the next.

Wood comes to the conclusion that Troy VI was probably the best candidate for the Troy of Homer...after watching this production I would say he's probably right.  On the Internet many commentators make the argument that it ""almost certainly"" has to be Troy VIIa, but when you see the series and actually look at the evidence Michael Wood has so carefully assembled in months of filming, it would be difficult to come to any other conclusion, even today with the results of recent finds at Troy.  Researchers going to Troy might want to watch this series before heading to Turkey, I think they'll find it very valuable.

I disagree with Wood in one area: he comes to the production assuming that the tales of Homer are but legends, and by careful examination of historical sites and the research available to him at the time, he arrives at a point that he becomes convinced that the fantastic stories of the Iliad are true, are historically tied to the Late Bronze Age, and have a basis in fact...save one.  At the end of the production, he glosses over any discussion of the Trojan Horse and appears to dismiss this aspect of the tale as probably something that was left behind by the Greeks after they had penetrated Troy's walls, most likely a tribute to the god Poseidon for granting them victory.

Military ruses and tricks predate even Troy, and can be effective in any campaign.  I'm of the opinion that if his assessment of the available research and science on Troy firms up Homer's tale, then the story of the Trojan Horse is probably just as Homer describes.  After almost a decade of siege, it would have certainly been worth one last effort by the Greeks to gain entrance into Troy to win the battle, and at the low cost of only a few dozen Mycenaeans if the ruse failed.

Obviously something caused a sudden collapse in the Trojan's defense after successfully keeping the Greeks out for 10 hard years; a military trick like the hollow statue of the horse would be an effective explanation of the almost instantaneous failure of the Trojan's defense.  I'm of the opinion that the Trojan Horse is not a myth, but a hard fact.  Just because we can't see it, or touch it from our archaeologists' efforts, doesn't mean that it didn't exist.

2012700,4,B0001KL5BW,"I watched this back in the 80s on Australian public television (SBS) and was immediately hooked on it.  Missed a couple of the episodes and have since been trying (waiting) to get the whole set on VHS, DVD, whatever.

I bought the book (in lieu of the DVD) but found that quite heavy going (book contains a lot more detail).  The DVD will actually help with the reading.

It was good to see that the material still holds up even after some 20 years since it aired.  I found the follow-up interview with Michael Woods quite interesting as he reflects on his past effort.

2012702,5,B0001KL5BW,"An unlikely, exuberant blend of history, myth, literature, politics and geography, this search is one of the few and one of the best of its kind.

The series presented by Michael Wood is as relevant and as entertaining as it was when first shown in 1985. It is a quest: far from compiling all known facts about the Trojan War (there are none, as we have no direct evidence) Wood shows convincingly that archaeologists and historians have often looked for, and selected, artifacts that bolster the interpretation they have previously held. Wood engagingly confesses to this himself. By surveying earlier interpretations of what may have happened in Bronze Age Greece to inspire the poem of Homer, and interviewing contemporary historians who give their interpretations, Wood invites us to evaluate these. This is a program for people who enjoy the thinking process.

There are few shortcomings to the series: these can be summarised briefly. Wood's objective to allow landscape to interpret history sounds much better in the study. In the field it can too easily become a mix of light journalism and travelogue. Quite a few of the landscapes must have had a more obvious connection with the subject to the makers of the series. The viewer probably needs to concentrate, review and reflect upon some sequences; at first viewing the effect is somewhat diffuse. But as this is a series viewers will almost certainly watch more than once, this is not a great flaw. And the landscape does shed light on the subject in many sequences.

There is some recapitulation, and a few sequences where pacing flags as we see Wood walking down a street approaching a museum, or climbing its steps. The summaries were necessary originally for viewers who joined the series late but could have been removed for the DVD release. But these, and the slow spots, are useful for the brain to catch its breath. This series covers a lot of ground.

The key to the subject is the poem of Homer: the Iliad. Wood tells us quite a bit about Homer. His name means the hostage, which brings many possibilities to mind, one of which is that he might have been a foreigner, not Greek. There seems to have been many who had a hand in the Iliad: Bronze Age bards who sang of the greatness of their patron's families, hymns celebrating founders and demi-gods, a seventh century poet who made a definitive version, scholars in the time of Pesistratos who collated differences in order to standardise the text and began the written tradition, and the scribes who passed down copies to the Renaissance period, when the text was first printed. How text can be preserved in an oral tradition is demonstrated by Wood in visits to Ireland and Turkey, where we see traditional tales of the length of the Iliad being performed. How reliable historical references are in such a tradition can of course not be demonstrated in Homer as there are no comparative sources. But Wood explains some of the techniques bards used to remember lengthy texts, epithets always associated with particular places and people, repeated phrases to describe, for instance, the sea or the dawn. Many scholars have commented on the exactness of scenic descriptions, as though Homer (or his sources) had been there at Troy. Wood interviews soldiers who argue that the portrait of the Greek soldiers is in accordance with their own experiences of men's behavior in war. He interviews a weapons specialist who has reconstructed the weapons Homer describes. Slowly and convincingly Wood builds a case that a war did take place at the traditional date, though as the whole purpose of the narrative tradition was to glorify the past and exaggerate the exploits of heroes, it is likely to have been on a smaller scale.

Wood has impressive success following Homer's epithets about places. He demonstrates that windy Troy is still very windy, that Thisbe of the pigeons still has many pigeons, that many of the lesser contingents in the war came from sites unoccupied since Bronze Age times and which today bear traces of Mycenean architecture.

Two of the most unlikely details of Homer's war Wood is not as successful in explaining. The first, that the war lasted ten years, he does not mention. Long wars, as distinct from a state of hostility between two powers with seasonal raiding parties and occasional battles, were beyond ancient logistics and economies. The Peloponnesian War, which was a long war, destroyed the entire Greek culture. A ten year siege in territory controlled by the Hittites, far more powerful than any Greek state, would definitely not be possible. The second unlikely detail is the wooden horse, which nobody has ever believed in. Wood speculates it was a metaphor for Poseidon, lord of earthquake, who often took the form of a herd of thundering horses. There is evidence that one city at Troy could have been destroyed by an earthquake (although in a later episode Wood questions this theory).

Wood traces the rise and fall of ancient Bronze Age powers: Minoan, Mycenean, Egyptian, Hittite, Assyrian, Babylon, and tries to make a case for Greece in the period being united under a loose federation. Famously in pre-classical and classical times Greece was not united: there was no 'Greece', and Wood doesn't get very far with the idea of a united Greece led by the overlord Agamemnon.

Troy and its war are not just the province of Homer. For us they are the creation as well of visionaries, pioneers of the science of archaeology, who dug on or near the site which today is recognised as the site of Troy: men such as Heinrich Schliemann, spade in one hand and a copy of Homer in the other. Wood surveys these archaeologists and their theories and discoveries.  Wood also looks at the career of Sir Arthur Evans, though refraining from any examination of Minoan civilisation, merely commenting on later Mycenean occupation of Minoan sites.

Helen? Was she the lovliest woman who ever lived? The cause of the Trojan War? Love, Wood admits, leaves no trace in the archaeological record.

Wood's other series are well worth investigating. Almost as good as the Trojan War series is the one on Legacy, a survey of key civilisations east and west (though at six times the market price of Wood's other programs it is unlikely to find many buyers). In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great is a stunning journey through several war zones which gives a vivid impression of Alexander's great achievement. In search of Shakespeare is just about the best discussion available on Shakespeare in this form.",1162684800,11,6548,4.895401262398558
2012713,5,B0001KL5BW,"I remember this series on PBS in the mid-80's. Because of

the way PBS scheduled its programing, there were episodes

I viewed 3 or 4 time, and at least one I know I never saw.

That has now been corrected!

The one impression that I remember above all at the time

was that ""Gee, could the Greeks really be the 'Baddies' in

this story?"" Did Agamemnon really use the abduction of

Hellen as just an excuse to plunder Troy and deliberatly

infuriate the king of the Hittite Empire? After all, as we

have been taught in our Greco-Roman culture, weren't the

Greeks supposed to be the ""Good Guys""...?!?

And what about the one facet that is only briefly touched

on during all of this...those piratical Sea Peoples. During

this very period, they were in jepordy of losing one of

their most valued holdings to the west, the land of Canaan,

to an upstart band of nomad tribes known as Israelites, and

their ""Desert"" God, Yahweh...hmmmm, what role did all this

have on the ""dark age"" soon to befall this region?

While at the time thought provocing, it is good to see that

many of Michael Wood's speculations and findings have been

proven correct over the past 20 years.

No ""Hollywood"" style heroic music or modern actors ""playing"" history. Everything in this movie is real, based on research, up to the highest scientific standards. It's as closed to the truth about that war as you can get.

The program is over 20 years old, and suprisingly it makes it better. 20 years is a lot of most of us, and you can see how different life was in mid 80s from this program. The people were different, towns, cars. But it's nothing for the Great Troy. The memories of those days have made it through thousands of years and they still excite people the same way as they did 20 years, a hundred or 2 500 years ago. This is truly amazing how that ancient war from Bronze Age era is still capturing our imagination.

Overall, this is probably the best program about the Trojan War you can find. It may look a little bit old, slow and low tech.

Mr. Wood is a very charismatic presenter.  But is what's better is that he took the story of the story of the Trojan War from the pages of modern myth to reality.  I have read Homer and I knew about Schlieman, but other than that, I was ignorant of the Trojan War.

Mr. Wood started with what a regular person knew about the war and then took it into deeper level.  I was fascinated by the connection he made to the Hittite Empire.  The thought had never occurred to me that if a Troy did exist, it might have trade relations with empires to the east.  He also included experts in the fields of archeology, modern history and history of the period.

If you are an ancient history buff, you probably know who he is. In his classes, we didn't simply learn about names, dates, and the ""headlines"" of events, but were taught to investigate original source material and do our own analysis of the historical facts. All popular histories are colored by the biases of the writers. As they say, ""history is written by the victors."" Michael Wood's Trojan War series is approached from the point of view of the professional historian. He uses Homer's Iliad as his first guide. Any historical study of the Trojan War begins with Homer. Then he examines Homer's references to place names, events, etc. The section on the ""Catalog of the Ships"" is simply brilliant. He even travels to Thisbe and checks to see if there really are a lot of pigeons there! He refers to making over 40 trips to different places in the Aegean to check Homeric references against surviving artifacts and geographical landmarks. And this happens in the first episode.
