7829822,5,6302668816,"This dvd/vhs Celebrity Centerfold in 2015 might seem lame or weak

But, people forget what a massive story The whole Jim & Tammy Faye Bakker  scandal was.....

Jessica Hahn was Jim Bakker's kryptonite and it lead to The Bakker Empire crumbling
this was pre-internet it was Massive

Playboy at the time did the smart thing payed her major bucks to do there magazine
which lead to Jessica Hahnn becoming this ""C"" List Sex symbol
hooking up with Sam Kinison having a on again off again romance with the gonzo comedian
making a few appearances on Married with Children
then getting involved with  1/2 of the creators of MWC

The dvd overall is pretty good Jessica looks good her scenes are decent (but, the VQ is crumby
PB was very cheap when they took there back catalog of titles they transferred there VHS tapes to dvd
There was no real remastering or cleaning up picture quality
Almost all there older titles that were first on VHS
are basically VHS-Rips onto dvd's

This is by far one of the most interesting time capsules ever done by Playboy

The dvd is somewhat Rare and out of Print now
If you look around at Pawn Shops or Used Book Stores you might find a used copy dirt cheap
It's a interesting collectors item in terms of Pop Culture status
and everything surrounding the scandal
It's strange PB has had major financial troubles for years now
you'd think they would re-issues all these out of print dvd's
It would create cash flow but, what do i know I'm not some dried up old man still wearing a bathrobe trying to prove my manhood 24/7",1444694400,2,1545,4.512544802867383
7829823,4,6302668816,"Playboy / Celebrity Centerfold: Jessica Hahn is 56 minutes and was released on video March 10, 1993. The Jessica Hahn part of video was tame and that is putting it mildly. There was only one truly nude scene in the video. That is when she is doing the domination scene. There are other scenes when she is nude but do not last long. The twelve minutes footage of Echo Johnson was much better. There was more nudity in that twelve minutes then there was in the Jessica Hahn footage.

7829824,3,6302668816,"Hahn's tranformation (abetted as it was by Hefner's money and the same scalpel that has given us the current Michael Jackson) is phenomenal.
Since the time this video was made Jessica has attempted to transition into legitimate actress with no real successes  to speak of. She's had some re-occurring roles in variouos Howard Stern productions but even those were more for their titillation value and less for her acting ability.
Despite at least 3 layouts in Playboy, Jessica seems to have gone kicking and screaming into obscurity. Although various internet porn sites overflow with her in various poses. All told, being someone's ""rape victim"" [her allegation against the defrocked televangelist Jim Bakker] is a chintzy way to achieve some sort of back door celebrity status.
The thing she and most of the women appearing in PLAYBOY seem to desire above all else (a home and a family and a loving husband) has so far to the best of my knowledge eluded Miss Hahn. Obviously, Anna Nicole Smith to the contrary, eye-pleasing cleavage cant get you everything you want in life.

7829825,3,6302668816,"Hahn--who pouted so convincingly about how she was violated by the televangelist huckster, Rev Jimmy Bakker--refused to be a quiet pious little victim. In fact in this video when we aren't ogling the skillful work of her plastic surgeon, we notice how Jessica tosses a cross against a wall. The symbolism of a cross shattering is too blatant to miss. You get the idea that Hahn expected her bodacious bod (along with capped teeth and new nose) to catapult her into the zone of Jenny McCarthy or Vicky Lynn Smith (aka Anna Nicole). Sadly Jessica had a brief ""celebrity-hood"" but soon descended into the realm of B movie ""actress"". These days (Nov 2001) I doubt Hahn could even get air time on the Stern radio show.[Stern has the dubious honor of ""discovering"" Hahn. Her attorney during the PTL ""scandal"" was able to get her on Stern's AM shock jock show]. This is quite a video, nonetheless. Hahn's strange progression from ""church secretary"" to soft porn star is a strange trip. We'll never know what really happened between her and Bakker in that motel room. She's been quoted as describing her tryst with Bakker as a forcible rape, while other times it is described as an affair. Either way, her brief intercourse with Bakker did two things: it did evangelical Christianity a huge favor by weeding out that money-grubbing false prophet (and his wife!) and allowing a rather plain gangly gal from Long Island to become the centerfold dream-come-true of Jessica Hahn. Jessica could have become a crime victim icon and a regular lecturer on the aggrieved feminist/victim lecture circuit. You go girl and hold onto whatever celebrity you still have before you too become a footnote to 80s trivia!",1006041600,6,1694,4.865051903114187
