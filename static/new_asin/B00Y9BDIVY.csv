8717736,4,B00Y9BDIVY,"This is an enjoyable bike ride video and Cornwall is indeed a beautiful scenic place. The film makers are obviously talented in that they created a very stable jitter free film, and yet my only suggestion is that they should start using a graduated gradient tint grey filter to cover and reduce the excessive light coming from the sky, because at several times in this film the sky and horizon were overexposed and washed out with no detail at all. A gradient tint filter that is rotated to cover and reduce the light coming from the sky will cause the sky to be a normal blue color at all times and the ground and horizon to have lots of detail and color at all times.",1533254400,,669,4.36
