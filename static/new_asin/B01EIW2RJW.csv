A must add to the collection",1476144000,,50,4.1
7736194,5,B01EIW2RJW,Disclaimer: the plot of this show and general story can/is and will be confusing to people who are of the simple series. But other than that the animation the feel and the music makes this one of my top 5 anime to watch. I'm happy that there is a collection so I didn't have to buy 2 seprate Boxes. I do recommend the show even tho some parts are WTF just happened it draws you in. Would I buy this again yes but only if the set I have ever broke.,1475971200,4,447,3.923076923076923
7736195,4,B01EIW2RJW,"I'm very happy to finally be able to purchase the complete set of this series, rather than two sets with only 11 episodes each. Guilty Crown holds a great deal of nostalgic value for me, as it was one of the earlier anime series I watched as a teenager. The soundtrack, composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, is quite interesting even apart from the series, and I would definitely recommend a listen for fans of his newer works. Objectively speaking, the series as a whole is by no means a masterpiece and I cannot fully recommend it to everyone, as the plot makes very little sense in places, especially towards the ending. The series would likely turn off most casual anime fans. If you already know you love Guilty Crown, though, this set is a better deal than buying the original two-set release.",1471132800,11,790,4.609929078014185
7736196,2,B01EIW2RJW,I don't have a problem with the anime. the case it came in was broken in half. tho its probably its because i live in Alaska and the shipping sucks here. some other dvds i got had been stab in the front but it didn't bother me. the discs work fine btw,1470700800,,251,3.8461538461538463

8758803,4,B01EIW2RJW,"A great premise, a wonderful setup, uneven delivery.

This could have been great, and verges on great most of the time, but the isolation, laws, and behaviors simply do not really seem to be something I could accept.  It is worth watching, but still manages to disappoint some of us because it substitutes gore for emotion, violence for change, and sputters as much as it works.

It was worth the time to watch, probably great if you feel the system will crush us all.",1524614400,,468,4.5476190476190474

8758809,5,B01EIW2RJW,"This is my very first, physical copy of my small anime collection I decided to start. As Guilty Crown has a special place in my heart (despite how the story can bring a bit wonky at times), I decided to order a physical copy to keep at home.

The quality of the product arrive in great shape. I was a little worried it might be scratched or spmething, but nope. It's a nice touch to have both the dvd and bluray, nonetheless part 1 and part 2 in one package. This is a great deal for anyone who has watched and enjoyed the series.

This anime has a lot of hateful reviewers, sadly. I recommend borrowing from a friend or something and watching it before buying this. The story is nice, there are some epic moments, and the soundtrack is very nice. However, many find the story to be full of nonsense and plot holes, and not many like the main character.

So definitely give it a try before buying this is my best advice. I personality enjoyed this series very much. It has a good touch of realism when it comes to character development (the main character isn't your usual overpowered, mature, know-it-all guy) and the story isn't too bad. Give it a go!",1485475200,3,1153,4.3534883720930235
