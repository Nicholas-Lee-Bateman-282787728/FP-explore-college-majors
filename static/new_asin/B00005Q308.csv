7949990,5,B00005Q308,"Maria Ford and others do a fine job in this excellent comedy/thriller. She is always a delight to see and this film gives her the opportunity to display her acting skills.
The DVD has no features whatsoever though, not even scene selection. It's no better than a tape which you have to fast forward or reverse to get to a scene you want. Plus the dvd is $21.96 compared to the few dollars for the vhs!

Twisted movie about killing people and taking their jeans. Very wierd but watchable like a train wreck.",1210377600,,506,4.440860215053763
7949991,5,B00005Q308,"Very, Very good movie, never gets boring because it hits you with a new plot twist every few minutes.  The movie also had a very creepy feel to it from the very beginning.  I also found the soundtrack very good, and the songs fit what was happening in the movie at the time.  I especially like the theme song ""I Want More"" and the song ""Neighborhood"" by Space, which is in chapter 14.  Although this DVD does not have a chapter menu, it does have chapter stops, which you can go directly to if you have a good DVD player with chapter search.",1040774400,12,541,4.223300970873787
