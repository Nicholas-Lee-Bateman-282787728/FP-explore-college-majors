8161019,3,B000LC4WQA,This is a telenovela that may have been great if unedited. But it was clipped so badly that the story felt kind of jumping from one story to the other.,1222732800,,151,4.066666666666666
8161020,4,B000LC4WQA,"Living in Chicago where Azteca America (TV Azteca's U.S. operation network) is only available in certain areas of the city (mine not included), I am not able to watch any of the aforementioned network's telenovelas. Upon seeing that Westlake Entertainment was releaing a few titles on DVD, I took a gamble and bought both this one and ""Amor En Custodia"".

I LOVED this telenovela! It's a light-hearted family comedy without the exaggerated characterizations of ""the people of the barrio"" that Televisa productions project. The story is about Tito Sanchez, a simple fruit vendor who is a widower who supports his 4 kids and lives with his sister/transexual brother and his deceased wife's sister. One night, he stops an elderly lady from commiting suicide on train tracks and both her life and Los Sanchez's change forever.

Part ""El Premio Mayor"" and part ""Beverly Hillbillies"" , the story balances out family and love issues with comedic scenes where we see Los Sanchez adapt to their new environment. Like I stated before, the storyline of ""poor meets rich"" is not as exaggerated and disrespectful and never makes them seem like fools but rather simple people who are adapting to a foreign environment.

I have to take away a star from the otherwise favorable rating due to the editing of this DVD. There are a few moments where circumstances are commented on after they happen and we never knew where they originated from or who was the perpetrator. I only counted very few instances, probably only 3 examples. It's not nearly as bad as the ""Mirada De Mujer"" or ""Tres Mujeres"" editing where a new topic was discussed in every scene. Eventually one can summarize and get the gist but it gives the DVD a bit of a sloppy pace.

Otherwise, the story is great and definitely light-hearted entertainment. It does NOT include English subtitles so only Spanish speakers can enjoy this one unfortunately.

If this is what TV Azteca telenovelas are like, then I really am missing out on a great channel. I hope they release more of these serials on DVD so that I and many others can enjoy them",1179964800,3,2086,4.815642458100559
