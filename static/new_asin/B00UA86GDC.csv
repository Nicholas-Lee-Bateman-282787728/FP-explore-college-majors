7031605,4,B00UA86GDC,"Production, quality of shots, & editing were ok. The writing was nicely paced, but the chemistry between the lead roles was amazing, which more than made the movie. The 1st 5 minutes is slow, but overall this is a movie I'd recommend. :)",1438732800,5,237,4.534883720930233

7031610,5,B00UA86GDC,"Super cute movie which takes full advantage of Ryan Eggold's charm.  Indy filmmaker Amos Posner created a sweet, rainy day romance on a shoestring budget, but you'd never know.",1437436800,3,176,5.068965517241379

7031628,5,B00UA86GDC,"Fell in lust with Ryan in The Blacklist...he's just as hot in this movie too...but
the story line is sweet, sexy and fun too.  A nice little quirky romcom good for
a lazy afternoon with popcorn!",1443744000,,194,4.388888888888889

7031651,1,B00UA86GDC,"Don't waste your money. The acting, directorship, and characters are all pathetic. One of the worst films ever, and I'm sorry we allowed ourselves to be suckered into paying $3.99 for this clunker.",1442534400,,197,5.0
7031652,1,B00UA86GDC,Boring......not worth even a dollar.,1442102400,,36,6.4

7031654,4,B00UA86GDC,Decent movie.,1440979200,,13,6.0
7031655,3,B00UA86GDC,"It was an above average movie, that was ruined in my mind by the fact that there was clearly a great transition for the dialogue at the end in which it was completely ignored.  It just ruined the movie in my opinion.

I guess this would be a spoiler alert!!

When she was talking with the reporter and he tells her a way to overcome the sleeping issue with a man.  The transition should have used that in the first encounter between the couple at the end.  After He asked her, how she has been doing, and she replied with I have been okay.  She should have simply said, ""So, I was thinking maybe we could switch sides...""  He says, ""What?"", She explains the reporters suggestion.  They Kiss.  The End.

There was just way too much dialogue at the end.  It ruined it for me.",1440806400,,877,4.6

7031659,4,B00UA86GDC,"I first saw Ryan Eggold on The Blacklist and loved his performance on the show.  So I decided to give this movie a chance.  It was good.  I didn't skip scenes  Or stop movie for a break like I sometimes do.
Glad they gave us a chance to view movie instead of showing in ny/la only.
I wish all movies that play in limited release will be released on VOD.
To give the other 48 states a chance",1439596800,7,390,3.9615384615384617
7031660,3,B00UA86GDC,All was well except female lead.  She wasn't tremendously attractive & not a good actress by any means. Their wasn't enough chemistry or passion to categorize this as a romance.,1439078400,,177,4.9
8704915,4,B00UA86GDC,The movie was good and funny. Worth renting,1491868800,,43,4.5

8704923,1,B00UA86GDC,Very slow to unfold. Didn't really go anywhere. Female actress needs acting lessons. I think this is her first and only movie.,1448064000,,126,4.7727272727272725
