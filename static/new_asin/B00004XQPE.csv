7926242,1,B00004XQPE,"I've been an avid hunter for many years but wanted to learn a little more about long range shooting so I tried this video.  Unfortunately, I can say I know no more now than I did before watching.  A significant portion of the video is Tubb promoting a shooting vest, and the remainder of it is him or someone else talking about his credentials and then him showing off his shooting.  I'm sorry to say I would have a hard time recommending this video to anyone other than a complete beginner who hasn't shot before.",1294531200,2,514,4.389473684210526
7926243,4,B00004XQPE,"I question whether the other reviewers here understand rifle shooting well enough to appreciate Tubb's demonstrations in this video. Here is an overview of some of his feats therein:

- From sling-supported prone, hold half the size a one-inch paster at 50 yards (1 MOA).
- Shooting sustained/rapid fire from sling-supported sitting, fire 5 shots inside 3 MOA.
- Starting from standing, adopt a sling-supported prone position and hit eight 8x12 inch plates at 200 yards in 12 seconds.
- Using a vehicle engine block as cover, adopt a sling-supported kneeling position, engage a 8x12 inch plate at 200 yards, and return behind cover in about five seconds.
- Police snipers typically shoot at less than 100 yards. Tubb discusses the trajectory issues and sight settings needed and performs demonstrations on coins (US quarters) to prove the point.

If you can do better than all of this, please, make your own video! I'll gladly pay to watch it! No, there isn't tactics in this video, rather, it is a series of marksmanship ideas useful for police snipers.

Yes, he discusses a vest he designed because it specifically addresses the police sniper's needs. All riflemen realize the benefits of a shooting sling, but a loop sling is too slow to put on and uncomfortable to wear for long periods. The Ching sling solves the loop-up time problem for field shooting but still ties the shooter to the rifle. Tubb's design removes the arm loop or cuff and uses the back of the vest as the attachment. A competition-style ball joint sling attachment provides instant on and off and the sling neatly tucks out of the way when not in use.

A top level shooter analyzed a real problem and offered a good solution. Better still, he provides impressive demonstrations proving the validity.",1291680000,,1774,4.883720930232558
7926244,1,B00004XQPE,"This video is called Tactical Sniper techniques for Law enforcement. I am a police officer/SWAT team member.  I bought the video due to the fact that I am going to a sniper school and wanted an easy way to get some basic information. This video is nothing more than a ad for Mr Tubbs tach shooting vest.  The shooting in this video is poorly explained and not at all Tactical. Im sure Mr Tubb is a far better shooter than I will ever be but he is not a ""tactical police sniper""!  I would not recommend this to anyone unless you want to buy his vest.",1174435200,26,549,4.160377358490566
7926245,1,B00004XQPE,"The truth is that I was disappointed and wasted $30. I'll stick to the facts and nothing but the facts. First of all from the beginning to the end of the dvd Mr. Tubb talks about the Blackhawk Shooting Vest, on how he designed it. He kept saying over and over how good the Blackhawk vest is. Buy the vest, buy the vest, that is what I got out of the dvd. I'm not questioning that the vest is not a good investment it probably is, but my point is the dvd was nothing more than a commercial to sell the vest.  The second thing is and probably the most important is what he is trying to teach.  All he does is shows you how to sight in a tactical scope.  He uses a Leupold tactical scope and I will have to say that Leupold scopes are top of the line.  I do have to give him credit for the type of scope.  If you do not know how to dial up a tactical scope, then by all means, buy it.  If you are experienced in making adjustments, save your money and go buy some ammo and practice, to me that is more valuable than wasting $30. on a dvd.  I give the dvd one star because the commercials had more information.",1121385600,50,1106,3.954954954954955
7926246,3,B00004XQPE,"I ordered this movie for my father-in-law as a present, and upon opening it, we both sat down and watched it immediately.  It has some information and techniques I hadn't seen before or read, so it was a worthwhile purchase.  The problem is that the production quality is pretty low.  Lots of bad audio due to wind noise in the microphone.  Not so bad that you can't hear what's being said, but loud enough to be annoying.",1044576000,3,422,4.441558441558442
7926247,4,B00004XQPE,"Great for long rang shooting techniques for varmit, target or police tactical. Lot of good information, but doesnt cover trigger control or rifle set ups that allow you to shoot with that precision.",1036368000,4,198,5.03030303030303
