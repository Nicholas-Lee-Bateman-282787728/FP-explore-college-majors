8278346,3,B001AOAYWE,"I bought this dvd to use in my classroom. I have used it and my kids enjoyed it. However, I think a few things could be improved. I was not pleased with all the preachy talk while the dvd is playing. My goal in using the dvd is to have them stretch and relax not to convince them to do yoga. I also thought it was very fast paced and hard to keep up with. It gives you very little time to make sure everyone is set up to do the position. I find it much easier to just do positions with my class without the dvd.",1363564800,,511,3.7850467289719627
8278347,5,B001AOAYWE,"I watch this with my 6 year old.  She loves it too. I also shared it with her kindergarten teacher and she used it on rainy days when they could not go outside to play.  She said it was very helpful.  I am not really a yogi person but yogakids make it fun and easy for everyone, young and old.",1240704000,,293,3.85
8278348,5,B001AOAYWE,"Wow!  I bought this video for my child's teacher.  The kids watched it with the teacher over and over again.  It has three flows and lots of fun extra ways to use yoga in school.  The teacher loved it cause she was able to do yoga with the kids.  She said she noticed a difference in the classroom. I bought one for my family to use over the summer.
Great music and visuals.",1213228800,,374,4.068493150684931
