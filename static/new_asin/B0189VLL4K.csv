8741817,5,B0189VLL4K,"You know when I was a kid I never realized how f'd up this show really is. I mean I love it but I just realized a few things. He's basically a wimp, who gets ""sauced"" up thinks he has super powers and tries to fight crime. In reality, he's a bumbling drunk that barely avoids getting killed by villains and only seems to catch them by accident or with ample help from others. I never realized any of that as a kid but it's so funny to see it now... F'n Genius! So funny it will make you cry!! It's hard to believe there's only 18 episodes!? A must buy 4 sure!!!",1467331200,3,561,3.9734513274336285

Enjoyable with or without Super Sauce.",1465689600,3,310,4.133333333333334
