172333,5,0963093932,"I am a physican that wants to exercise more but don't like the the high impact aerobics videos because of a foot injury.  I like how Jodi's videos creatively adapts exercises to be done in a chair, and would be useful for a wide audience, young and old.  In this video there are some leg and ab exercises, but it is primarly focused on a series of arm & shoulder strengthening exercises.  I will recommend this tape to my patients.",1159920000,26,431,4.3625
172334,4,0963093932,My mother recently got foot surgery.  I bought her this dvd because she was concerned that she wouldn't be able to exercise.  She loves it and says that she will use it even after her foot has healed.  It has great abdominal work for those who can't do regular sit ups.,1156032000,19,269,4.235294117647059
172335,4,0963093932,It offers a good workout. It is good for people in wheelchairs who need to tone up their upper body. If you don't want a long workout this is for you.,1137369600,10,150,3.870967741935484
172336,5,0963093932,"I suffer from OA of the hips and knees.  My doctor has been after me to exercise to lose weight but it's a catch 22.  I can't stand long enough to do aerobics and they are painful to me.  This DVD solves that problem.  All the exercises are from a chair!  These are non-impact exercises and I can see and feel them working.  I'm so happy with this DVD that I'm going to get the rest of the series.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has trouble standing, is overweight or simply wants a non-impact workout to begin excercising.",1118448000,64,535,4.237623762376238
172337,5,0963093932,"I am an out of shape 60 year old.  I expected an exercise video done in a chair to be easy but I found it to be just what I needed - easy to follow and challenging to do.  You can make it more challenging by using heavier weights, or easier by using soup cans or no weights at all.  I recommend this for any older adult beginning an exercise program.",1117756800,8,350,3.9014084507042255
172338,5,0963093932,"This tape has been a great addition to my chair exercises!  It really has helped to make muscles in my not so sculpted body.  Even my hubby found the workout to be a challenge and he isn't in need of chair exercises!  The workout is great, Jodi is a terrific instructor, and the pace is perfect.  This video tape has muscled it's way into being my #1 choice for toning!",1091664000,6,369,4.228571428571429
172339,5,0963093932,My 90 year old mother lives with us and I bought this for her so she could get a little exercise since her stroke left her unable to go walking like she used to.  She loves this tape and uses it twice a day to try to rebuild her strength.  Thank you.,1062288000,17,250,3.7884615384615383
172340,5,0963093932,"I am 33 years old and overweight. I have had fibromyalgia for over 12 years and have always been looking for a tape that would allow me to workout yet not kill me off in the process. Given my fibromyalgia I have to be careful in how much I stretch out. This was so nice to do! I had a good stretch of my muscles but it didn't overwork me and I wasn't in pain after the 20 minutes. You do feel all your muscles and they instruct you how to do things correctly, an added plus! Excellent! Worth all the five stars. However, if you're looking for an aerobic workout this isn't it. This is about like doing weights in a gym. I would check out Stolove's others for that.",1060819200,21,664,4.076335877862595
172341,5,0963093932,"Before I bought this tape I did some research to seek out the opinions of those who had followed any of the Chair Dancing tapes.  Oddly enough, the only negative opinions were from those who had NOT tried the workout - those who had tried the tapes loved them, including nurses and physical therapists.  Those who want to laugh at the idea of getting your heart pumping while seated can go right ahead, I'm sure those laughs will burn off a half calorie or so.  Meanwhile, those of us who have been left out of other exercise routines due to physical considerations can quietly go on to stretching, toning, losing body fat and getting that great after-workout tingle.
Jodi Stolove has an incredibly physique, that's for sure, but her manner is calm, friendly and straightforward, none of this ""hey, you can look like me if you REALLY work hard"" that some instructors seem to radiate in waves.  Her movements are fluid, unhurried and easy to follow.  Emphasis is given to form, especially supporting the back with the abdominal muscles.  She reminds you with each routine which muscle group you should feel being gently exercised.  Breathing, stretching after exercising a muscle group, relaxation and a positive attitude make this tape relaxing and actually kind of fun.
There is a great variety in the people exercising with Jodi, plus size and diminuitive, male and female, younger and older.  Some people work with weights, some do not.  Slight variations based on muscle strength or physical consideration are shown in an inset, as are the occasional finer points of an exercise (such as ""drop your shoulders and bring up your chest"" being illustrated for proper posture).
No stress is placed on knees or ankles, so if your idea of hell is doing a set of knee bends while gazing at a woman in a size 0 leotard, you'll enjoy this tape!  No attitude, no straining, just a sensible workout.",1029283200,86,1891,4.7907692307692304

172345,4,0963093932,"I just purchased this video, primarily because (1) I have the ""Chair Dancing Around the World"" DVD, and like it, and (2) the amount of five-star votes for this one that are here on Amazon.  I WILL be purchasing more of these chair dancing videos because they are a nice change-up for me from the Peggy Cappy yoga that I do daily.  One important thing that I learned from Ms. Cappy is the importance of BREATHING!  We tend to concentrate so much on the moves that we forget to breathe!  Jodi does not stress this, but if you watch some of the people working with her, you will see that SOME (not all) are visibly exhaling at the downward portion of the move.  I liked that some of the folks are doing modified versions so that the viewer can choose which is best for them.  Jodi is perky and encouraging, and everyone is smiling.  I took off one star because this video is only 20 mins.  I would have preferred that it be longer.  (""Around the World"" DVD is 45 mins).",1451260800,,966,4.292817679558011
172346,4,0963093932,"Does what it says it will do.  Relatively easy to follow, and gives very good options for people who need to take it easier, or who want to kick it up a notch.  Kind of boring, but useful enough to balance out the boring side.  I am hoping to memorize the moves better, so I can turn down the sound, and put on my own music.

The exercises are really useful for a person to keep in shape who has a variety of pain or medical issues that make most exercise styles difficult or impossible.",1448064000,3,487,4.094736842105263

172364,5,0963093932,This is an excellent toning video for those who need to exercise in a chair.  Everyone (all ages) would benefit by using it.  I have had younger people use it with me and even they stated that they received a good workout.,1404950400,,222,4.261904761904762

172371,5,0963093932,"I have a disease that is hurting my legs so I can't do much exercise using the legs.  This DVD has some warm-up at the beginning involving moving the legs of which I can only do about a fourth or less of the exercises.  That's ok.  I love the rest where we lift the hand-weights up and to the side, etc.  This section doesn't get  too hard to do but pushes a little bit (which it should since it is an exercise program).

After I finish I feel IN CHARGE of my day, ready to get on with the needed chores or whatever else.  I feel terrific.  I'm hoping to get the next Tone Up DVD too.  I had always enjoyed her exercise programs before my legs got so bad.

I must say that I am sitting in a folding chair while exercising with the DVD--which is not good.  I highly recommend using the proper chair for your exercising.  My dining table chairs are on wheels and I have a very small apartment.  I'm still trying to figure out how and where to put a normal chair in here to exercise with.",1358985600,3,985,4.067708333333333

Also great motivation is that they have several body types working with her.  Including showing people who get off the rhythm and correct themselves plus show the modifications - It is very helpful to see other people NOT doing it ""just like the instructor and flawless.""

The videos are awesome. I plan to get some of the actual Chair Dancing vids by her to add to my rotation.

You will feel the burn even though you never stand up.  Jodi's cueing is excellent and the counting helps.  The diverse group of students is encouraging - a balance between older, younger, male, female, black, white, fat, skinny, more flexible, less flexible.  The music is at the right level and enhances the movements.  I like to follow this video with a 20 minute indoor walking workout video for a 40 minute exercise session.

I like the fact that I'm not just watching a slim woman doing exercises.  STolove has about ten people working out along with her.....old, young, slim, hefty, men, and women.  It's interesting to watch them go through the routines along with her.

It was a bit combersome going through the introduction time after time, but once you hit the dancing exercises, you were set.  Now FINALLY the DVD and bonuses -- there are MORE Chair DANCING ROUTINES:  These exercises show older people, heavier people, some with handicaps like unable to lift legs, etc. and the DVD encourages you to do only as much as you are able to do.  I have this one ""Sit Down and Tone Up"", ""Chair Yogi"", and the original ""Chair Exercises"".  All are definately doable for people who absolutely can not stand up to do exercises.  You need to watch them all a few times to get the ideas of the routines, but once you have them, there is no need for anyone to say they cannot exercise.",1209427200,33,775,4.460992907801418
172387,5,0963093932,"I like this 25-minute video.  It doesn't give you very much of an aerobic workout, but it does strengthen legs, abs, arms and shoulders.  The pace isn't too fast (not too slow either), and there is a small but friendly-looking class doing the exercises with Jodi. You use weights, so as you gain strength, you can up your weights to keep it challenging.  The 25 minutes goes very fast.  I would buy another of her videos, maybe one which does more dancing to get the heart rate up. I'm very glad I got this.
