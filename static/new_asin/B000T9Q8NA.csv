8208311,5,B000T9Q8NA,"I already bought Praising Spirit Vol. 1 (which I absolutely love), so ordered Vol. 2 as well. This DVD is also very elegant and very well produced. It is everything I hoped it would be. I love signing along to these Christian Hymns. It makes learning sign a beautiful and spiritual experience. The sign language performer (Hayden Riley) is very beautiful and truly inspirational. I highly recommend this DVD and Praising Spirit Vol. 1, to anyone who wants a wonderful and joyful experience learning sign language. I have now ordered all the other DVD's with Hayden Riley performing, (A Silent Night Christmas Carols in ASL; and The Patriotic Spirit). Thank you Hayden, you are a blessing to us all.",1365120000,4,698,4.873949579831932
