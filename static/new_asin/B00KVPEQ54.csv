8661940,1,B00KVPEQ54,"Asylum. A word that implies safety and compassion. You'll find neither here in this drecky collection of mostly Asylum productions. Here, the watchwords are ripoff, cheapo, and lousy CGI. I found this aggregation of losers onsale at a dollar store, paid $4.99 for it, and it wasn't worth the price. Asylum has a way of finding a half-decent actor to headline one of these schlockfests, then spending the remaining $18 of the budget on everything else. Save yourself time and money.",1427068800,,481,4.950617283950617
