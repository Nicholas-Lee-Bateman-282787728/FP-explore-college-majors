1012144,5,630529173X,"Unlike most similar ""documentaries"" (CNN's comes to mind), ""The Century"" isn't just a decade-by-decade grab bag of all the most popular trends, fads, and movies.  The approach is thematic; each episode tells the STORY of a chronological section of the past 100 years.  Thus, the chapters aren't broken up into meaningless decade chunks, but spans of years that make sense as a ""period"".  It's as much sociology as it is history; the people commenting on times and events are, for the most part, ""the common man"".  When well-known people do show up, they're likely to tell about listening to FDR on the radio when they were children, or wandering the country jobless in the 30's.  When movies and other pop culture items are referenced, it's usually in service to the historical theme (""Easy Rider"" for the late 60's cultural clash, ""The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit"" for Eisenhower-era corporate conformity).
The true test of this series for me was its inclusion of the death of Princess Diana in the final chapter.  To me, this would seem to be the sign of a lightweight ""nostalgia"" collection, a ""big"" event that was meaningless historically and culturally.  Yet, they made it work.  Placed in the context of the infotainment celebrity-as-religious-icon media overload of the 90's, it made perfect sense; the ultimate global-village celebrity spectacle (not to mention a neat bookend to the century that started with Queen Victoria's death).
Not deep, not exhaustive, but purposeful and well told.",987638400,5,1499,5.065040650406504
1012145,5,630529173X,"I have showed several of the videos in this set to the students of the high school history class that I teach.  My students seem to find the topics very interesting because they are not presented in the usual dry  ""documentary"" fashion.  Hint for teachers - The History Channel  website (that also sells this video for twice the price) has a great study  guide to go along with this set that includes vocabulary words and  discussion topics!",958694400,14,441,4.662337662337662
1012146,5,630529173X,"I love history.  It fascinates me, but especially American history, especially the 20th century.  This school year, I have taken a unique, new course at my school, titled: 20th Century World.  As a teaching tool, my  teacher has shown the movie for each decade whenever we've started that  decade as our next unit.  Even the kids who usually sleep through class sit  and watched it with great interest.  It makes you feel like you're there.  For example, yesterday we watched the video for the 80s.  Through the  segment about AIDS and gays, my entire class was sitting there saying,  ""Ohmygosh, I never knew it was that bad."" or ""That is so  sad.""  Through every decade, The Century: America's Time has offered a  personal touch to every event, instead of making it boring.  Every event  mentioned on this documentary has affected our life today, and this  documentary actually makes you think about how it has.",954979200,9,912,4.811688311688312
1012147,5,630529173X,This is an excellent recap of the century.  For young viewers and those who have lived through it.  The first video is about the early years and the end of 1890's.  Each segment is divided into sections the first one  also is about World War I.  The second is about 1923-36  and hitler 35-41.  The third volume is about homeforont war and the years after The 50's and  60's are covered together in the fourth.  The seventies is covered in the  fifth The Sixth set up the 1980's and 90's and beyond.  The narrative is  easy to understand and the clips are edited to run smoothly as a story.  Great.,952819200,8,597,4.318181818181818
1012148,3,630529173X,"After seeing bits on TV I knew I wanted to own this series.  I finally received it as a gift.  I wish I had asked for socks! The archival footage was excellent.  Add to that the interviews of real people who were witnesses to 20th century events, and you have the makings of a  great documentary.  However, the title should have been ""The Century  of America's Evils.""  Almost the entire series is made up of the ills  of America, especially of white males.  Apparently, Jennings believes the  main point of WWII is that Americans bombed civilians.  How does one show  events in Tiennamen square in 1989 and not show the man staring down the  tanks?  The tanks were shown but not the brave people who stood against  tyranny.  The video spent much time on Jimmy Carter's struggle with the  Iranian Hostage situation.  Jennings notes that the hostages were released  at the moment Reagan was sworn in, but does not tell why they were released  at that moment.  The fall of the Soviet Union is, apparently, entirely  Gobachev's doing.  I wish Mr. Jennings had a prouder, yet still realistic,  view of this great century.  I wish I had asked for socks instead of this  video.  Save your money, get the History Channel.",947548800,7,1214,4.630331753554502
1012149,5,630529173X,"This work is simply splendid.  Viewing these videos in their chronological order will refresh your memory and cement your knowledge of the important events of your century.  Jennings is marvelous:  his voice is warm,  intimate and authoritative.  The writing is near poetry in places, as it  weaves the events into a unified narrative.  The pictures are superb in  both content and technical quality.  The original music score is wonderful,  making the work highly dramatic and cinematic in places. A documentary  commemorating a century of history should be great...and this one is.  The  next time someone tells you history is boring or that TV only delivers  drivel to the masses, point them to this landmark work.",944265600,51,717,5.121739130434783

1012310,1,630529173X,"If I could give it no stars, I would. Very biased account, blaming the US for everything. Skipped over WWI, blamed the Brits for bombing Germany in WWII (with no mention of the Nazi's blitz on London that destroyed 60% of the city), criticized the Allies for killing the Germans who slaughtered 11 million people in concentration camps.  I was expecting a documentary, not anti-American propaganda.  No, the US isn't perfect, but we rescued Europe - twice.  And war isn't pretty - ever.  The History Channel's World Wars documentary is much better.",1408320000,,548,4.923913043478261
1012311,5,630529173X,"Wish these were on dvd, use this series in my history classes. Found dvds online but they are different from the vhs, some segments similiar but was dispointed. We are in a digital age you'd think they would be on a dvd or online :(
Great series for history buffs wanting to see the creation of the American culture.",1405728000,,316,4.372881355932203
1012312,5,630529173X,I love how this shows us the 20th Century American History. I watch it some times once a week. That whens I have done.,1392854400,,118,3.9583333333333335
1012313,5,630529173X,Excellent teaching tool for US History classes.  Very engaging.  Students retain so much more and have a much better understand of events through these episodes.  Must have a VCR though :/,1384560000,,188,5.0
1012314,5,630529173X,"Given students' proclivity toward visual input, ""The Century:  America's Time"" makes for an ideal presentation of US history in the 20th century.  As others have discussed, it is broken into bite-sized portions, digestible for the vast majority of young people (and adults, for that matter!).  Peter Jennings' narration/hosting provides an essential credibility to the work, and the blending of chronology and themes assists in creating understanding.  As there are a significant number of options available to educators, the challenge comes in finding something that is accessible to students and strong enough to meet essential historical standards.  The selling point came for me when a highly-respected colleague recommended the series without hesitation.  Whether you're a teacher, parent, or simply an interested individual, you cannot go wrong with The Century.",1362787200,,868,5.7421875

1012316,5,630529173X,I tried recording this series when it was on tv but didn't get it all and also had to deal with commercials.  So glad that I was able to get this boxed series - it is so fantastic - should be a must see by all who live in U.S. - going through the history from the late 1900's on is wonderful.

I show it to my students every year as they write their research papers about something historical. Kids today haven' the slightest idea about how everything they have and cherish, came about.

1012410,5,630529173X,"""The Century America's Time"" is a really well-done documentary that examines the different decades of the twentieth century as experienced by America. It includes interviews and lots of great photos and video footage of key events. The interviews are especially nice as they give the documentary that eye-witness perspective from people's memories. I bought this set specifically for the 1930's portion which I use in my tenth grade English class to give the kids a perspective on what was happening during that time period which is also the same time period that two novels we read are set in. Peter Jennings does a great job of narrating the videos. It's excellent.",1296950400,,667,5.018018018018018

1012414,5,630529173X,We recorded this series when it was televised several years ago.  We decided to get the whole collection minus commercials.  We are definitely glad we took this route.  It was worth seeing it again. I wish it was on DVD since VHS is becoming obsolete.  This is definitely a keeper in the library.,1264809600,,296,4.528301886792453
1012415,5,630529173X,The VHS tapes are of real good quality just as the seller described. They were delivered promptly and shipped securely so no damage would come to them.

1012417,5,630529173X,"When is ABC going to put this in DVD format?  This series has been very handy for me to use in teaching 20th Century US History.  I like the use of news clips, photographs and interviews.  The students like the interviews because it makes the events more realistic and personal.
Get on the ball ABC!  I've about worn out my tapes!!!!",1239235200,,333,4.409836065573771

I would love to not have to Rewind and FF on a VCR to show my students the many informative segments that I routinely use in my classroom.  This series is a must-have for American History teachers, but it certainly needs to be DVD formatted for convenience sake.",1238716800,,315,4.508771929824562
1012489,5,630529173X,"As for the person who complained that Martin Scorcese called the '80's the ""me"" decade, that was a popular theme of the time. Maybe you should go back and look at 80's and the literature about it from all kind of sources. Just like the 20's was often refered to as the ""Roaring"" 20's. 80's was often called the ""me"" decade. I also think it is not a liberal or conservative designation. Following the internalization of values and desires in the 70's, the 80's was when technology, growth, income and development all led to the application of the 70's trend of an individual ethic. People DID become more selfish and self centered, more complacent, in need of more instant gratification.",1172620800,2,686,4.725
1012490,5,630529173X,"I have used this series for a few years now and have had great success with it. Not just the old school compilation of talking heads, but an engaging, well-paced documentary. However, as others have said, I am getting concerned about its availability in the future when VHS players go the way of the 8-track. Anyone out there know of plans to put this on DVD?",1161302400,6,359,4.454545454545454
1012491,5,630529173X,"This series is so helpful to recall the chronological order of all of the things once learned in history classes at school. Hoever this series not only gives the facts, but adds a personal element to it by interviewing average citizens who remember the historic events recalled. By no means is this your ""boring documentary"". I have seen the series several times, and I still learn new things, and I still moved everytime, at the strength of our country and the tremendous blessing it is to live here.",1125964800,5,501,4.704545454545454
1012492,5,630529173X,My teacher showed this video in class and everyone in class enjoyed it immensly. I can't wait to watch it again. A great keepsake.,1100563200,3,130,4.458333333333333
1012493,3,630529173X,"As a couple of other reviewers indicated, this video set does a fair job hitting on all the major events affecting America in the twentieth century, but can't resist dwelling on all the ills - especially those of the Reagan era. The low point was Martin Scorcese's appraisal of the 1980's as being the ""me decade"" full of greed.  Who made him an authority and why doesn't anyone in the media ever see the 1990's the same way, when the US was even more prosperous?

DON'T confuse this set with the other 12-volume set, ""The Century,"" which addressed broader, global issues.  THAT set is FAR SUPERIOR to ""America's Time,"" especially the episodes on Hitler's rise to power, Lindberg's crossing the Atlantic, and the fall of South Vietnam.",1100476800,10,735,4.771653543307087

1012496,5,630529173X,"This video, The Century, America's Time, hosted by ABC
's Peter Jennings, served me well as a U.S. History high school teacher.  The reason I liked it so much was because it brought to life in short, 10 minute summaries, key events of the twentieth century.  Hosted by Peter Jennings, it had a much more contemporary feel to it than similar historical summaries.  The narration was snappier and held the attention of my students better than let's say a PBS or other History channel type visual documentary.  It supplement's any Twentieth Century U.S. History course because it capture's the emotional context that a text-book cannot reveal.  I found my students had a much better grasp of the times when I supplemented the text with these visual snapshots of key events during the century.  Because key events are broken down into 10-20 minute segments, it lends itself to the attention span of classroom students and instruction very well.  Most documentaries go on for 45 minutes straight on one topic.  This was extremely well done.  If I had only 1 video series to pick from to capture the flavor of the twentieth century, this is the one I would buy!",1029024000,25,1155,4.792929292929293
1012497,5,630529173X,"This set is a great overview of some of the most important moments in America's history over the last 100 years. Unlike other similar video series, this one seems to take a look at the larger picture of American history, focusing and piecing together many periods of time and showing how they all interconnect and lead to the next rather than going into great depth on specific events. My only disappointment was that there was not more to watch, as I would have loved to have seen more of the great video clips and images that are part of this series. Some of the video shown is amazing, and really shows the emotion of these moments and brings them more fully to life.
