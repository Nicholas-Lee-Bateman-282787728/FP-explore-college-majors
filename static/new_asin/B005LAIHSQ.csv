4722266,5,B005LAIHSQ,"Just saw this movie today and was TOTALLY blown away!! I've read the original fairy tale, and grew up with the Disney animated version just like millions of others around the world, but this adaptation was original and compelling.  It was also much darker and more action-packed than any version I've seen before.  The little twists in the narration and plot are backed up very well within the context of the film and I found myself buying everything they fed me.

Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman was a tortured man full of sorrow who finds new hope in Snow White's quest.  He used a different accent, especially when his character was drunk, than I've heard from him before, so I had little difficulty in believing him as a mortal who is NOTHING like Thor, the character who propelled the actor into worldwide stardom.

Charlize Theron is brilliant as always.  Her ""evil"" queen keeps the magic alive throughout the movie since she has to use several enchantments to both keep herself young and beautiful and maintain her power.  She has her own vulnerable moments which keep her almost identifiable to the audience, but not quite.  After all, who can really identify with the wicked witch/queen?

The real surprise for me was Kristen Stewart.  I avoid all things Twilight and watched her with a very critical eye.  She did an amazing job as the other title character, managing to embody the innocence and purity of her character as well as the fierce defiance that is set up in the film as one of Snow White's defining traits.  I read later that she has been afraid of horses since she was a kid, but she looked VERY confident on horseback in the movie.

In short, I HIGHLY recommend this version of Snow White.  It's NOT the Snow White your mom read to you, but it's most definitely worth the ticket.  There's even enough action and bawdy humor to entertain most men. =D",1338508800,9,1867,4.666666666666667
4722267,4,B005LAIHSQ,I would not call this movie lord of the rings or narnia but this movie did have a lot to offer in the way of action and somewhat good story telling. its basically the classic snow white story but with a lot of added features to expand in this epic film thier are battle scenes the dwarfes are thier as well i will not give anything away but this movie is worth seeing on the big screen.,1338508800,3,386,4.025974025974026
4722268,4,B005LAIHSQ,"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is visually extraordinary right from the start. Scenes featuring snow are always more memorable. Maybe its due to its lack of color or the way the snow seems to be falling so rapidly and yet so slowly at the same time, but ""Snow White"" plays this up on more than one occasion. Its $170 million budget is tossed around constantly with nearly every time Ravenna (Charlize Theron) is on screen or when her dark army is struck with something and shatters. The Mirror Man in Ravenna's mirror is also extremely impressive.

The cast is extremely solid. Charlize Theron does seem to over do it at times, but is mostly just extremely passionate about her goals, quick tempered, and borderline insane. Chris Hemsworth puts on a pretty decent Scottish accent as The Hunstman isn't a completely different spin on the characters we're used to seeing Hemsworth play, but adds just enough (being a drunk and completely miserable) to make it seem slightly different. The dwarves may be what saves the entire film though. They're both technically useful and provide enough comic relief from the grim tale that's being told to make the film way better than it should be.

The big issue though is that ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" feels like it borrows from a lot of movies you already love. The most obvious one being that the movie evolves into feeling like a junior or lite version of ""The Hobbit"" due later this year. The most impressive visual sequence is when the characters enter the dark forest. That entire sequence feels like it's pulled directly out of ""Princess Mononoke."" While Kristen Stewart is more than likely not on everyone's list of favorite actresses, she's actually pretty okay here. It's difficult to argue with only seeing rabbit teeth whenever she's on screen though.

The score is a lot like the movie, as well. There are moments of brilliance, but it seems to get overzealous at times and collapses on itself. What's odd is that the movie seems to cater to Bob Hoskins character of Muir. He's always got something to say about the princess and his introduction is stretched out the longest. When Snow White finally heads off to deal with Ravenna, the camera zooms in on Muir just so he can say, ""Farewell, princess!"" It just seemed very bizarre and out of place at times. Bob Hoskins is awesome, but taking the time to hear what Muir had to say so often didn't always fit with what was going on.

""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has style dripping from every frame of celluloid and features incredible imagery. The performances are mostly very entertaining, the score is fairly satisfying, and its special effects are just extremely well done and pure bliss for your eyes. The way the movie borrows from so many beloved franchises though and its rather bittersweet ending threw a monkey wrench into the works of fully enjoying of what this could have been. Nevertheless, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is delightful popcorn entertainment.",1338508800,4,2975,4.816046966731898
4722269,3,B005LAIHSQ,"MOVIE REVIEW #35 : "" Snow White and the Huntsman ""

Making his directorial debut, Rupert Saunders takes a long look at one of the very first original Grimm's Brothers fairy tales and tries hard to give it a new spin. Evan Daugherty (Killing Season), Hassien Amini (Drive, Jude) and also writer/director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, The Rookie) try and give the script a new modernized twist from original story. Unfortunately it moves very slowly and goes nowhere and often leaves you wondering where they are actually taking you next. I can see why this film pushed back its release date a couple times.

Of course the visuals are interesting and detailed, the costumes clever and inventive and cinematography almost gothic in nature - but the bottom line - the story takes a while to become one - an actual story. There's a new spin on everything from the `magic mirror', the poison apple and even the forest animals and fairies. (Which were the most visually stimulating for the eye!)

Now casting must have been a tough one, but given that she didn't have a whole lot to do (or say), Kristen Stewart (Twilight, Into The Woods) gives a somewhat subdued performance in a fairly dark film. As does Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek-2009, Thor) who is the Huntsman on a somewhat altered mission from the original tale. And, the two of them did not seem to connect - `chemically' for me.

Charlize Therone (Monster. Hitchcock) plays the `evil' Witch. Now although she was extremely expressive in her desire to be evil - she wasn't looking like she enjoyed what she was doing. Bitter and spiteful and not evil for the sake of being evil, Therone didn't seem like she was having any fun with a role that didn't have to be over-the-top - but at least interesting enough to make me believe she loved and desired to do what she was doing.

For me, the stand out performances came from the smaller but poignant characters - like Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook)play one of the eight dwarfs who is blind. His words of wisdom and `insight' actually explain and drive the story when things actually started happening. Also, Sam Spruell (The Hurt Locker, Defiance) play the evil Witch's brother who seems to deviously delight in his quest to find Snow White after she runs into the dark forest. Fighting and re-fighting Hemsworth many times.  Both Bob and Sam are engaging to watch when they are on screen. Sam Claflin (Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Untied) played a long acquainted childhood friend of Snow's who really made a connection with his duel mission as directed by the evil Queen.

Another plus for me was the representation of the Black Forest. Extremely creepy and true to the Brothers Grim original tale, the imagination of the forest attacking a person became visually scary. Also, the beauty and grace of the hidden forest, the forest animals inside this area and especially the fairies that occupied the plants, trees and animals = were quite stunning to watch. The special effects have come a long way to making the fantasy seem very real.

Overall...it is a long film, that is short of moving the story along and long on fighting and action sequences of hand to hand and horse to horse combat. The relationships have a new twist to them and be prepared to get a new really big twist on this old tale at the end of the film.

Definitely a family friendly film, however a little weak in the story and characterization department - I would wait for the DVD, online or rent it - Snow White didn't have the passion I was expecting.",1338336000,8,3541,4.6618589743589745
4722270,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Although my 8 year old daughter loved this movie, I was a little disappointed with it.  Although it's printed right on the box that the running time is 52 minutes, I timed it and it was only 25 minutes.  They must have gotten the numbers reversed.  Also, there was supposed to be a second story, but it wasn't there.  It had run out of tape after only 25 minutes.  I probably won't return it, since I'd have to pry it out of my daughter's hands!!  She loves cats and calls it ""adorable.""",994636800,4,487,4.239130434782608

4722428,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Kristen Stewart plays Snow White in this, but I think she is too ""rough"" around the edges or something to play someone who is supposed to be as pristine as Snow White.  I think casting should have gone perhaps with someone who looks younger, more innocent.  She does a lot of open-mouth acting, and I'm not sure if that was her decision or the director's, but it grows tedious, especially in the combat scenes.  Anyone who has been in an actual hand-to-hand wouldn't be so open-mouthed about it, since, of course, that's a broken teeth invitation.  But Kristen does have nice teeth, so if the acting chops (couldn't resist!) are lacking, then, I suppose, showcase the mouth.

To its credit, I think Liam sold his role, and seemed much more of a warrior in combat scenes.  Also, Charlize was good, and perhaps could've even played Snow White better than Kristen.  Or maybe they should've given an unknown a chance at this role.

I haven't seen Kristen in more of a ""bad girl"" role, and I think her bone structure and acting skills would actually be more beneficial there.",1519862400,,1070,4.654255319148936
4722429,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I watched this because of Charlize Theron.  She is my favorite actress.  Although she plays the villain and does it very well.  You are not meant to like her character in this.  Kristen Stewart is alright as Snow White.  Although she is more like Joan Of Ark,  When Charlize looks into the mirror and asks who's the fairest.  I don't think she has too much competition in Kristen.  This is not a kids movie.  It is a lot like Red Hiding Hood with Amanda Seyfried.  And it's not something you want to watch too often.",1519862400,,516,4.336842105263158

Snow white was kind of weak--meaning not a strong character.  She was also not ""the fairest in the land"" either.  There HAD to be better choices for actresses than whom they chose.  And ok, if you gonna tell a snow white story, make the ending show the princess and the ""prince"", in this case, the huntsman, end up together!  He kissed her awake and then you never see them together again.  It was just kinda pathetic.  They really played up the witch a TON, almost too much.  The dwarfs were just kinda sketchy.

4722912,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Every time FXX shows this movie on television, I've been compelled to watch it for a couple of reasons:

1. I have seen more versions of the Snow White fairytale in cinematic form than any other fairytale, from a campy children's live-action version starring Smallville's Kristin Kreuk to the famous animated classic from Walt Disney feature animation to the chilling live-action version starring Sam Neill and Sigourney Weaver. While Disney's Sleeping Beauty is my favorite animated film, my favorite childhood fairytale goes to Snow White. The Queen has fascinated my from my earliest years as a villain and this particular version thanks to the gorgeous and talented Charlize Theron highlights exactly why that is.

2. On that note, when I saw the trailer for this film back in 2011 or so, most of us, me included, were still trying to purge our minds of the Twilight films, so the very idea of seeing another live-action fantasy starring Kristin Stewart was anathema. However, due to my history with the story being adapted (as mentioned above), I couldn't resist the opportunity to sit down and watch it whenever it aired on TV.

Now, from the last two or three viewings I had, I can honestly say that this is how fairytales are meant to be portrayed: dark, scary, but with the intention of drawing young peoples' attention to the punishment of vice and the reward for virtue. Snow White and the Queen are two perfect dichotomous embodiments of those concepts. Also, whenever you're writing a story which has a clearly defined hero and villain, it is a well-said phrase that your hero is only as strong as the villain they go up against. The Queen is a legitimate villain: she is a powerful sorceress who is a master of disguise, deceptions, and poisons. In every version of the fairytale I ever read I understood, even as a child, that this story would not be resolved until either our innocent heroine or her villainous stepmother had DIED. The Queen embodies vanity and jealousy whereas Snow White embodies purity and innocence. Snow White was always in legitimate danger while the Queen was at large, and I always feared for her. Not every heroine needs to be a sword-wielding, cynical badass to engage our emotions and support. While Kristin Stewart does not exhibit much of any range at all, it is our villain as well as the supporting cast that buoy up the plot and execution. Charlize Theron is not only terrifying as the Queen, but with one mere flashback scene (at least in the theatrical cut) lasting all of about 30 seconds, she is humanized as well, allowing us, the audience to connect with her, if only briefly, as the broken, battered, embittered beings we are all capable of becoming. This vain, power-mad witch is also a woman, unlike a villain such as Maleficent, who meant to be the personification of pure evil, or the stepmother in Cinderella who could only attack psychologically due to her hold over Cinderella's freedom. This villain can attack mentally and physically, but is also able to make us recognize her shattered, deformed humanity.

As for the other aspects, they're all perfectly serviceable. This no Lord of the Rings, despite their obvious attempts to draw that crowd in, but for me, they work just fine. While not a ground-breaking cinematic spectacle, it is a visually-satisfying adaptation of something from my childhood. I give it a B- for effort and an A- for casting as Stewart's performance was stilted, but inoffensive.",1494115200,2,3470,4.866328257191201

4723048,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Charlize Theron delivers a consumate performance in this latest rendition of the Bros. Grimm classic.
Ms. Theron is an excellent actress who understands how to use her considerable attributes; both as a formidable, no nonsense actress who carefully deploys the enticements of her beauty with skillful subtlety and grace to achieve a devastating portrayal of her role as Queen Ravenna that is believable and as close to a level of perfection that does justice to the original spirit of the Bros. Grimm tales.

Chris Hemsworth impresses the viewer as a serious actor with unexpectedly adroit linguistic skills, showcasing his ability to achieve a convincing colloquial accent with admirable consistency. It is refreshing to observe a larger range Mr. Hemsworth's acting skills that are hindered by the Disney/Marvel depiction of Thor.

One of the most pleasing aspects of the film is the reinterpretation of the fabled magic mirror with whom Ravenna confers.
It is a spectacular and uniquely original reinvention of the mirror, which is computer rendered with frightening realism and possesses a personae that is a chilling metaphor as a literal mirror of the human psyche.

The storyline is excellent up until the appearance of the 7 dwarves.
At this point the plot reverts to a more saccharine handling of the story that is distressingly more akin to all the previous versions of Snow White which, for the most part, were dumb downed and childish.

The appallingly juevenile and cliche ridden aspects of the film are mercifully dispersed incrementally and completely discarded  by the end of the movie leading up to the final showdown between Ravenna and the huntsman. We are also spared the confectioners piping bag ending of Snow White riding into the sunset with prince charming living happily ever after. If that was the case, I would have given it only 2 stars.

Ravenna's costumes and makeup are a wonder to behold.
The special effects are lusciously rendered and breathtaking; is there nothing these technical wizards of CG aren't capable of.",1488499200,6,2049,5.138138138138138

My player is the NEW OPPO UHD 4k player(the best on the market). I have about 15 4K movies and they all play fine except this one. So I know it's the movie and not my player. Also I did some research and it said that the 4K version of this movie is only an ""upscaled"" 2K copy so it's not really 4K. So save your money and stick with the regular Blu Ray copy. The follow up to this movie ""The Huntsmans Winters War"" looks great in 4K and plays with no issues.

I was afraid that some theaters would do this once 4K hits and that is rush out copies of movies and called it 4K,and charge you a extremely high price when it's really not 4K.

4723553,4,B005LAIHSQ,"First of all, I'm not really a big fan of most of the actors in this movie. For me, the draw was the title. I wanted to see what their ""version"" of this Snow White would be. I liked it, but didn't love it. I think Chris, who plays THOR wonderfully, did a good job as the Huntsman. Spot on there. Charlize Theron, well, played the part exceptionally, but some of her scenes I think were a bit overacting. Nonetheless, she did a good job of the Villainous Evil Stepmother. Kristen, I didn't know before watching this movie. I had heard all the fuss about The Twilight movies, but I did not see any of those. Not interested. I don't think she was a complete flop in this movie, but she could have been more emotionally involved in most of her scenes.
The scene were she is trying to ""rally"" her loyal fighters was just okay. It lacked some serious emotion. I thought she looked good though throughout the movie. She really hasn't been in anything that I am aware of since this movie. If she really wanted to be a better actress, she could improve.
Charlize is pretty good in most, if not all of her roles. Although not a huge fan of hers, either.
This movie had a pretty good storyline and it flowed well all the way through.

4723734,2,B005LAIHSQ,"The story of Snow White is a fairy tale that is much beloved and well known  by all, however this ""retelling"" falls well short of its mark, and while visually well enough done, there are some ""character flaws"" that were glaring enough to make it impossible to enjoy the film in any measure.

First and foremost, Kristen Stewart.  Most know her from the Twilight series of movies, wherein she plays an overly-mopey teen who falls in love with a glittery not-quite-vampire.  In that film, her ""acting"" consisted largely of breathing with her mouth open, being clueless and angsty, and generally doing very little of any value while retaining a blank expression. In Snow White and the Huntsman, she was noticeably better, but still emoted very little from one scene to another, wearing the same face and neutral features.

As an actress, she doesn't fit the character very well at all.  She is not in any way lovelier than the Queen to look at, nor does she embody the symbol of innocence that Snow White does.  The script does throw a few animals her way that try to help her, but they are not enough to carry her over the goal.

The Queen, however, is an other-worldly beauty who at the same time is a terrifying creature of deadly evil, consuming the youth of others to maintain her strength, will and appearance.  She is statuesque and stunning at her best, with flowing blond hair, imposing crown, and eyes that reflect her moods, and her brother, who sports a page-boy haircut incongruous with his rank and station, is her fawning attendant and enabler.  It is he who seeks out and hires the loutish Huntsman, who is found in a public house getting drunk or in a fight.  Apparently he had a reputation that preceded him, since the page-boy brother seeks him out to hire his services.  Snow White, upon reaching the age of her maturity is revealed by the  magic mirror as being ""more lovely"" than the Queen, which prompts her to ""consume"" the girl's youth and put an end to her.  Snow White, however, has escaped from the Queen's prison where she has been held all her life, and flees to the woods.  It is there, among the dead, leafless trees that she is captured by the Huntsman and the Page-boy Brother, who intends to bring her back to his Queen.  He has a sudden change of heart though, when Page-boy Brother blabs that he never intended to pay for the Huntsman's tracking efforts.  Snow White and the Huntsman escape the Queen's brother and his men and soon encounter some of the fantasy creatures of the forest, including 7 little men.

I found this film to be rather formulaic, in that the script writer didn't invent too much of it out of his own imagination, instead darkening all the elements we already know about.  With the exception of the Queen, who, like in previous films, was beautiful and deadly. the other characters are made less likeable, inaccessible, or dead, while a lot of other elements are tossed in to pad out the storyline.  It's not a bad film, per se, since it may well be perfectly suitable to the angsty teen set.  But for the rest of us, especially those with remotes or a mouse, there's surely something of better calibre film-craftmanship than this, just one click away.",1480377600,,3209,4.624338624338624

I even had to go back and watch it again after catching the sequel as it is a far superior story than Winters War which felt forced without the continuity. Charlize Theron brilliant in both of course as is Chris Hemsworth, but Kristen and the A class actors playing the dwarves gives the story a lift and life the second is missing. I wish they had continued the story from Snow White's perspective but I am happy to leave this as a stand alone movie without the sequel. (I do enjoy Emily Blunt as the sister not mentioned in this first movie and of course replacing the brother not mentioned in the second).

This movie gets 4 stars IN SPITE of her. Chris Hemsworth is fabulous as the Huntsman and Charlize Theron as the Queen play the roles to perfection

The storyline was good line... Stewart just ruins is for me...even though she doesn't have many lines (thank goodness for that) her acting is just awkward.... it's like she is unsure of herself in every role she plays

Anywho...I enjoyed the movie. Not enough to buy it unless it was like 5 bucks or less.

Stewart, though, simply does not carry her role as the title character well at all. The real downfall of the movie, however, was the script; very few character motivations were understood or sensible; it all felt contrived, like all of the characters were driven by the demands of plot and not their own best interest, with ultimately lead to a final confrontation that was lackluster and nonsensical. Ultimately, it was a poor execution of a solid story concept with just a few highlights to get one through.

4724989,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Charlize Theron is awesome as The Evil Queen (Ravenna). However, my rating and review is more on the condition of the actual product itself.

The actual cover is all wrinkly/warped like it was exposed to water or something. Also, there's an indentation in the center. I am the type of person that likes having my stuff in neat condition, especially when its supposed to be NEW!
Sadly, this is not the first time I have ordered movies from amazon and received crappy covers. The last one had a case in which the inside tab that keeps the disc in its place was broken leaving the movie to flop around loosely inside. I'm starting to think that buying movies from amazon, although better priced than most, is just not worth my money. For this reason I gave 2 stars.

The movie was good, but not spectacular. I felt like the story line was dragging at times.  It is really hard to make a rendition of a fairy tale and it be awesome anymore. There are so many of them. I don't think it is a movie that younger children would probably like. Overall, I think the movie was ok. I hope the next rendition in the series is better.",1472428800,,694,4.102941176470588

I know that at aged 57 my tastes are not in line with younger persons who attend theaters today, but I enjoy fantasy movies and was hoping to enjoy this one. But it's simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everyone is dirty, everyone is wet and muddy, everyone speaks in that urgent whisper so common today in both movies and tee-vee (then the CGI effects explode onto the screen and you have to turn the volume down, then turn it back up when the urgent whispering starts again), it's just simply a boring, over-blown mess. I cannot recall a single line of dialogue, there is not a single laugh, everyone is either angry, or relentlessly grim, Bella is Bella as usual, the plot is a meandering mess, the dwarfs are the only likable characters, and oh did I mention Bella is Bella?

And we're supposed to believe that after living for years in a tiny room, malnourished with no exercise, she is miraculously able to don armour and wield a sword at the movie's end?

Younger children may find it a bit too scarey to watch at bedtime.  Adults will probably be bored.  I was really disappointed in Theron's performance and am surprised the director didn't do some retakes on many of her scenes.  She just was convincing at all and looked as if she had a difficult time getting into character.  Not a lot to write home about in this adaptation of the story.  Fell short in a lot of ways.

Writing 2 stars.  Acting 5 stars.  Effects 4 stars.  Length 2 stars.  Kristen's beauty 5 stars but she's so not my type.  Kristen's acting was mostly 4 stars, but she hit 5 many times, and maybe 3 a few times too.  Side stories that needed resolution was 2 stars -- just too many of them to track.  Charlize was 5 stars beauty, 5 stars acting, but she was in many a boring scene that lingered for whole minutes too longly -- film could have been under 90 minutes and gotten better.  Seeing all the familiar actors kicked me out of the film many times as I inwardly remarked about that actor's other roles, how much they've aged, etc.  A major bother for me.

She can now look very mildly concerned, very mildly pleased, and I swear there was a time or two when she actually looked very mildly interested in what was going on around her. She has also mastered the art of The Heaving Bosom while standing absolutely expressionless and moving her eyeballs just a tiny bit, which makes huge strides in convincing the audience she really is truly awake. Like I said, great strides since Twilight. The problem may be, in all fairness, the fault of casting directors for putting her in roles that, shall we say, may be somewhat beyond her reach? What she needs is a movie in which she can play someone in a coma. For the whole movie. Let her sink her acting chops into that one. It shouldn't be too very much of a challenge. Hopefully.

4726127,1,B005LAIHSQ,"The special effects, scenery, locations  camera work, absolutely fabulous.

I felt sorry for Charlize in this role because I feel her overacting in too many places was just an angry response to herself in accepting the role because basically, she had no one to play against.. She is beautiful and a powerful performer and how she got stuck with Kristen Stewart as the LEADING Lady is an insult and a mystery to me.  (suppose it's movie politics)

The casting director for Snow White?  OMG, what's the deal. Their leading lady has no talent, depth, cannot express passion, emotion or joy. I found myself writing script for her throughout the movie.  One of the Amazon reviewers told everyone to give the movie a break and accept it as fantasy... in my book how does a girl locked in a tower almost her entire youth,  with only twigs in the room to start a fire for a simple comfort, filthy dirty, come about being a trained, skilled soldier basically overnight and one trip through fairy land.  The lead is totally non-dimensional. She has never been nor will she become a great beauty by most standards. Beauty emanates a flicker of light from within and there wasn't any expressed even with the kiss of the Huntsman.

I particularly wanted to kick myself again for paying for this movie at the end with the Queen Crowning Ceremony...the again over acted haughty head gesture that was supposed to impress and make her look like a leader of her kingdom and her people. I could go on buy why....most of the reviewers agree and probably said it better than me. The supporting actors tried. and I applaud them.",1465776000,3,1606,4.666666666666667

4727240,1,B005LAIHSQ,"I'll admit, I've never been a big fan of Kristen Stewart and so when this came out, I chose not to go see it in theaters (petty I know but it's the truth). After it hit theaters, people told me how great it was and when I heard there was a prequel coming out, I thought ""Well maybe I should give it a shot."" Nope, nope, nope. Big mistake.
The story needs a ton of work and the characters should be developed further if the writers expect me to care one way or another as to what happens to them. There wasn't enough back story for the ""Wicked Queen"" (Charlize Theron). There were several scenes that tried to allude to this great tragedy of her life but the bulk of it was never shown. Why did she hate men SO much? Was her mother a witch? Why was she separated from her mother but not her brother? Where was her father in all this? Why was she so hell-bent on ruling the kingdom?
The huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) was interesting but, again, not enough development. Am I really supposed to believe he, all of a sudden, out of the blue, with no build-up at all, is in love with Snow White (Kristen Stewart)? Really? Her character wasn't even very likable! She's supposed to be the fairest in the land and purest of heart. Ok I'm not going to get into someone's looks, but what made her purest of heart?? They never explain, or even really mention, why she's so special.
They also throw in many other fantasy elements that are never elaborated on... To be completely honest, it seemed like they threw a bunch of things at the wall and saw what stuck, and, in many cases, it fell flat. I only spent a couple bucks to rent this and I want my money back, can't imagine how I would have felt if I paid to see it in theaters.",1462147200,,1716,4.218844984802431

4727394,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I had a difficult time paying much attention to this. No character development whatsoever. The sheer brute force acting of Charlize Theron gave her character more depth that the script provided which was bordering compelling at moments. Beyond that, this was a completely forgettable poorly written, meandering, and nonsensical story.

So forgettable that I think I actually saw this in theaters, forgot, watched it again, and am still not sure if I saw it before.  I already don't remember much from my viewing last night.",1461715200,,523,5.141176470588236

I think it had great possibilities to continue as a strong series had it not been plagued with 'behind the scenes drama'. .I have to be honest and say that once I learned about that 'drama', it made it difficult to have empathy or become a fan of Kristen Stewart's character.  On a more positive note, Chris Hemsworth delivered a wonderful performance as did Charlize Theron!  Even better...  while film makers decided not to develop Kristen Stewart's character/role, they have decided to continue the series with the Huntsman!

Great cinematography made it worth my time to watch this movie.  But as for the dialog, i've seen better. It was actually painful to piece together a coherent tale out of what was said.  Take my advice, don't pay any attention to the dialog, just enjoy what's going on in the background.
  With that all said and done.  This isn't the worst movie i've ever seen.  Far from it.  But, don't place it as a great movie either.  The tragedy of the huntsman and the evil queen is what really made this story.  Plus, the dwarves really added a bright spot to it.  Watch if you want, but I can guarantee a lot of you will wish you hadn't.  Save this one for a rainy Sunday when all the chores are done and you want an hour or two to sit and relax.

4728275,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Disclaimer - I haven't seen Kristen Stewart in any other film AFAIK.  Filmed in either Sepiavision otherwise known as a celebration of the wonderful colors of dirt, this movie is depressing from the onset.  OK, we have the poor little princess, locked away in a tower at about age 10, so I guess we must forgive her for being an uneducated zombie girl - no education or playmates in a tower for years will do that.  After an unbelievable escape, aided by a few birds and a nail that shouldn't be there (did they nail the stones together - there's no wood!!!), she immediately has the strength and knowledge to run for long stretches, swim in the ocean and ride (bareback!).  I think we're not supposed to notice the bridle and reins on the horse in a few of the scenes.  The poor horse gets abandoned soon and possibly goes on to live a better life elsewhere.  (Hopefully the horse does not go to ""Neverending Story"" to get stuck in yet another swamp).  Hunky Huntsman, in keeping with the general theme, is also covered in muck and gullible enough to believe the Queen's lies to him.  Hunky Huntsman really, really needs to take some lessons on accents - fantasy Aussie just sounds pretentious.  Hunky Huntsman captures Snow White and about then I was so stultifyingly bored that I turned it off.  The Evil Queen is much more convincing but really powerful people don't screech, especially in front of the underlings - it just undermines your authority, dear.  If there are scenes in which Hunky Huntsman takes off his shirt and cleans up, let me know and I'll consider watching a bit more (or at least fast-forwarding).",1456790400,,1621,4.6328671328671325

4729028,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie showcases the acting skills of Charlize Theron as the evil Queen, and also showcases some 21st century special effects, including armies made of glass and a dark forest which is very much alive. This will be best to watch on as large and high def a screen as you can possibly find. The plot is mostly loyal to the Snow White fairytale, and it does not feel at any point like the fairytale infringes on the modern take or vice versa. In other words, it doesn't feel dated, and it doesn't feel like a betrayal of the original tale. Critics say that Kristin Stewart fails in this movie. I don't think so. What I think happened was they didn't give her enough lines! Too many scenes where she stand there in awe of something, not speaking, when a few choice words could have vaulted her character into a new dimension. I wouldn't fault her at all. The dwarves are really well portrayed, and the Huntsman is an honorable character. I was not thrilled by the ending at all. Good battle scenes. I really enjoyed the movie for Charlize's acting and the FX. Both of those elements carry the movie. I would say thematically the film suffers from ageism (to be old is to be lifeless) and a suggestion that outward beauty is power, though corruptible, is not very enlightening. I would call this movie 'good fun' at best.",1444435200,,1320,4.504166666666666

4729131,5,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White and the Huntsman
 We all know the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.  Believe me, this is not your fathers Snow White and the sweet, goofy dwarves are nowhere in sight.  This is a fast paced action flick based closely on the traditional tale, but with a lot of extra plot stuffed in.  And it works, thanks to goodness; it already seems like forever since the Avengers started off the summer season.  Some of the other recent big budget films just didn't work well enough to justify their gy-normous production costs.
 Two young people that the movie audiences already appreciate star as Snow White and the Huntsman-Kristen Stewart from the Twilight series who comes to this film with hordes of fans and Chris Helmsworth recently as the Norse god Thor, a young man who has a good career ahead of him as the new hunk of Hollywood.  Helmsworth plays a troubled, even suicidal, widower who is tasked with retrieving Snow White from the deep dark woods.  He grows his character believably, he fights athletically and has the right touch of humor fed to him by the excellent writing team.  Stewart however seems to have the ability to show confused concern but little else.  Often the ingnue is not given the heavy lifting acting wise to do in a film, which works to her advantage.  She does photograph well and director Rupert Sanders does a credible job of filming around her.
 The big acting credits go to the enormously talented and lovely Charlize Theron as the deeply, darkly evil queen.  She scared the daylights out of me.  This is a combination of her fine talent but she was also backed up by fabulous special effects.  The combination allows us to see a being-she is hardly human when we meet her after living 20 normal lives-both irresistibly beautiful and horribly, sickeningly evil.  And there are the dwarves.  Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone lead a band of full sized English actors as the dwarves.  Movie magic makes them just as convincing as real little people and the quality of the acting is much improved.
 Director Rupert Sanders is known for his videos and commercials.  This is his first time as a full length movie director.  That may explain why each frame is so packed with information.  He is used to grabbing the attention of the viewer and not letting it go.  This is not just a function of speed but also of putting so much into each scene that the viewer is fully engaged in just assimilating everything on offer.  He was expertly aided by Production Designer Dominic Watkins (The Bourne Supremacy) who builds a fully realized world for his actors to inhabit.  Big snaps also go out to three times Oscar winner Colleen Atwood (Alice in Wonderland) for Costume Design.
 This four saw blade winner runs seven minutes over two hours.  The PG-13 (violence, blackest of black magic) film was made with what seems to be a modest budget of $170 million.  The world-wide gross is already $96 million after only three days.  When the producers make movie goers happy, the movie goers make the producers financially happy.  Every time it happens I am reminded just how much I love the movies.",1443657600,,3125,4.6911764705882355

4729201,2,B005LAIHSQ,"The real star of this film is Charlize Theron.  Her version of the tormented Queen Ravenna is not so different from her portrayal of Aileen Wuornos.  Both are tormented, ravenous, mad, craven, and psychotic, only Queen Ravenna is not unattractive.  She only wants to destroy.  To get back at the world, which obviously had hurt her.

I like Kristen Stewart.  She has received some criticism for her looks and her acting, but I think she is quite lovely, and I think there are very few actresses who could recite those hokey lines from Twilight with the sincerity and depth that Kristen Stewart did.  There is a reason why the franchise became so popular - because of the quality of Kristen Stewart's performance.  The audience likes her, believes her, empathizes with her, and most of all, wants to be with her.

Unfortunately this film is not a good fit.  Kristen Stewart as Snow White looks absurd in her warrior costume, and false and insincere observing the beauty of the world.  She should be rougher, stronger, smarter, and she didn't persuade anyone that she could be equal to or rival the queen.  Indeed, my favorite part of the film is when Queen Ravenna basically walks away from her - discarding her - as Snow White tries to land a blow.  I was more amazed with Queen Ravenna's prowess than persuaded by Snow White's innocence.

This  film is an interesting interpretation but not always entertaining.",1442275200,,1412,4.776859504132231

March Boy awards: Supporting Actor-Chris Hemsworth, Supporting Actress-Charlize Thereon, Costume Design, Set Design, Cinematography, Visual Effetcs and Film Editing.

I am SO saddened that Rupert Sanders Snow White and the Huntsman is getting so much bashing over the internet because I absolutely ADORED this film. I find it the perfect blend of fantasy and realitya fairy tale retold in a gritty, dark, realistic manner very much like the setting of Medieval England. The production values are pure Academy Award materialone magnificent image after the next. Queen Eleanor walking through the snowy garden at the beginning, Queen Ravennas wedding, Snow White on the altar in the church, the storming of the castlehow can one forget them?

I know of more than a few people who dislike Kristen Stewart for multiple reasons: she cannot act, is too stiff and wooden, her teeth are too big, only got the role because she was the directors mistressand all I have to say is this GET OVER IT ALREADY! This was a TOTALLY DIFFERENT take on the character of Snow White. She was supposed to be quiet, stoic and grave and Stewart nails this to a T. Let someone lock you up in a tower for ten years. When you get out on the skin of your teeth will you be all ditzy, perky and cheery, sing, dance and talk to animals? Her voice is rich and mellow throughout and her British accent is spot on. Probably her best moments are when she says the Lords Prayer in the prison (an indication of where she gets her strength and courage to survive) and her stirring Who will be my brother? speech to the Dukes army.

I also understand theres been a lot of controversy over how stupid the magic mirror could be to say Kristen Stewart was prettier than Charlize Thereon. The mirror never meant the fairest in appearance. I mean, that is SO NOT the point of the movie!!!

Snow White was revered throughout the kingdom for her INNOCENCE and PURITY, NOT her physical charmswhich is a mere matter of mans opinion. Even as a little girl, we see her and her childhood sweetheart William playing in the wheat fields with the peasants and walking through the streets with a magpie that had broken its wingan indication that she is amongst the masses. Even though she is the princess she is NOT SO HIGH AND MIGHTY that she dare not associate with the lower class.

Her mother, Queen Eleanors (played by a stunningly gorgeous Liberty Ross) one speaking scene sums up the whole point of the film. You have a rare beauty in here. She points to her daughters heart. Never lose it, my child. It will serve you well when you become queen.

The mirror was referring to Snows character when he told Queen Ravenna, she was the fairest.

I should have killed her long ago. Ravenna gasps in horror.

Beware. Her innocence is all that can destroy you. But she is also your salvation. Take her heart into your hand and you will never again need to consume youth.

If only Ravenna would have abdicated the throne to Snow, repented of all the evil she had done and found a way to build a meaningful relationship with Snow, she would never again need to take away other girls beauty by sucking their breath out because she would no longer be concerned with physical beauty now that she had someone to share her soul withsomething that would be totally incongruent to her nature making it impossible to do so.

Chris Hemsworth perfectly melts into his role as the world weary huntsman who begins as a self-pitying drunkard who slowly has a change of heart when Snow White gives him a cause to be courageous for and his soliloquy in the church scene towards the end about how Snow and his deceased wife Sara deserved better and he is sorry he failed them is a genuine tearjerker.

 But this show most unquestionably belongs to Charlize Thereon as the stepmother/wicked witch Ravenna. Not only is she amazingly beautiful but she delivers her lines with such great inflection and dramatic power.

My favorite of her lines are:

1. Mirror, mirror on the wall, whos fairest of them all? Her tone is so slow, intense and creepy you simply KNOW shes going to kill whoever the mirror names.
2. Men use women. They ruin us and then they cast us to the dogs like scraps. And so Ill TAKE YOUR POWER LORD KING AND YOUR LIFE!
3. When her servants are setting the mirror up in the beginning of the film. OutOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!! The first time I watched that part I almost jumped out of my seat!
4. There was a time when I would have lost my heart to a face like yours and you no doubt, would have broken it.
5. You don't even realize how lucky you are NEVER TO KNOW WHAT IT IS TO GROW OLD!
6. How does it feel to watch them DIEEEEE?????
7. I shall give this wretched world the queen it deserves!

But best of all, Thereon never makes Ravenna look like a one dimensional villainEVER. Yes, she is a usurper and a sorceress and yes she has no goodness but watch the scene where she sighs after losing her temper with her brother Finn, heals the scar on his face and asks him in a much quieter, calmer voice to find someone who can hunt Snow White.

When she is preparing for her bath, she points to the two milk fountains she built for the beggars at her gate so they could have something decent to drink and says Do you remember when we were children begging for scraps from our kings gate and no one gave us anything? Am I not kinder?

And of course, there is the flashback where Ravenna is reminiscing on how she went to a witch as a little girl to drink a spell so she could be the fairest in her village. Unfortunately, the spell came at a large price for when she came of age; she was kidnapped and raped by the king of her country. A tear trickles down her cheek and even though I know Ravenna is an evil, evil woman I felt SO SORRY for her at that moment because it looked like even she was regretting her wish to be the fairest now that she had become a slave to the spell. I got the feeling that being wronged by her king messed her up so badly spiritually and psychologically that she felt that NO GOOD QUALITIES could EVER exist within her even if she tried. The look on her face as she dies before the mirror at the end says it allshe looks almost glad that shes free from her misery.

Dont be discouraged from purchasing this film. Great for discussions and well worth your time. Honestly, masterpieces like this aren't made every year.",1437436800,3,6456,4.479148936170213

4729662,5,B005LAIHSQ,"A wise author once wrote: ""Fairy Tales are more than true; not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.""

""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a dark, stylistic work full of spiritual prowess which takes the classic German fairytale and turns it into a mature experience at the cinema, performing a balancing act between the sacred and the profane in a visual spectacle of a movie. The film, to put it bluntly, is mere Christianity, in all its sublime, multifaceted dimensions; including its vivid characterizations of evil, personified in the beautiful but wicked and gothic Queen Ravenna, played with fire by Charlize Theron. Like Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings,"" this film is filled with Christian imagery, symbolism, theology, and even sacred spirituality.

Consider this scene: locked up in a dark, cold dungeon within a tower in a  haunting, gothic castle, after her father (the king) was murdered and his kingdom was overtaken by a brutal army, we see a young woman, Snow White - played by Kristen Stewart - dirty, hungry, and forsaken; on her knees she makes her way toward a fire-place in her cell, starts a fire for herself, then contemplates the memory of her dead parents, as - with a spirit of perseverance - she prays:

Our Father, Who Art in Heaven

Hallowed be Thy Name

Thy Kingdom Come,

Thy Will Be Done,

On Earth as it is in Heaven,

Give us this Day our Daily Bread,

And forgive us our sins,

As we forgive all those who have sinned against us.

Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.

The prayer is spoken with such reverence, humility, and undying hope in the face of so much darkness and suffering which surrounds the main character and her people. I cannot remember the last time (if there was one) wherein a major Hollywood motion picture gave such due respect to the recitation of the Lord's Prayer, transmitted to us by Christ throughout 2,000 years of sacred tradition.

Meanwhile, Queen Ravenna, the murderess of Snow White's father, sits nonchalantly on her gothic throne surrounded by black ravens, the ominous birds seem to follow her endlessly (at times personifying pieces of her identity, as her very name - Ravenna - exemplifies). There is a depth to her evil. It is not simply a worldly evil that this character personifies but a spiritual one, it is demonic. She is not just the classic ""Evil Queen"" in this story. She is a sorceress, possessing paranormal powers, having a history with the occult that included a spell being placed on her as a young girl intending to empower her. There is something deeply cannibalistic about her, too, savage and animalistic, as she intakes the hearts of other human beings to keep her youth and physical beauty - this is connected to the spell that she lives by. At times, she eats the raw (bloody) organs of dead birds. Her encounters with the ""Magic Mirror,"" far from the innocent childhood story of the Brothers Grimm, have the ambiance of a person encountering the occult, playing with black magic, embracing forces that should be avoided.

""It is her purity and innocence that can destroy you,"" the Magic Mirror tells Queen Ravenna of Snow White, who eventually escapes the castle and becomes a threat to the dark queen.

The theology here is powerful. Ravenna had a spell cast on her which gave her paranormal powers and reign over endless kingdoms of the world. She possesses the kingdoms of the world, like the Devil who came to tempt Christ in the desert. Only one of pure blood can undo the spell, destroying Ravenna's powers. We are reminded of the connection between Eve and Mary. One was a woman who was responsible for bringing Original Sin into the world while the other a Woman - the one creature who was made pure, immaculate and spotless - who could undo the sin of Eve by bringing Christ into the world. In other words, only one of purity can undo the evil.

""Remember this old trick,"" Queen Ravenna tells Snow White after offering her a red apple to eat in a chilling scene. The apple is poisonous. Snow White didn't know. Queen Ravenna disguised herself as a friend when she offered the poisonous apple, as someone good, someone unrecognizable, someone from Snow White's childhood. The scene is rich, the allusion in the language - ""Remember this old trick"" - goes back not only to Snow White's childhood encounters with her friend but all the way back to the Garden of Eden, when Eve accepted the poisonous fruit from the serpent, who came disguised as a friend.

Snow White dies from the poison. Her resurrection, clothed as she is in royal, white garments, has a touch of the sacred in it. It is Christ-like when she rises again, conquering death, experiencing a mystical light, a vision known only to her, before her body rises again. It was one of the seven Dwarves who encountered Snow White in an earlier scene who prophetically sees her destiny as a Christ-like figure. The Dwarf, an old blind man, ""sees"" what others cannot see. He is like Simeon in the temple as the baby Jesus is being presented. He makes the prediction that this one, Snow White, is of the pure blood, that she ""is destined.""

As she rises, her resurrection gives oppressed people hope, seeing that death has been conquered. She puts on an armor and commands an army, leading them to overthrow Ravenna's kingdom. Seeing Snow White, a young woman, in a medieval armor, leading an army of men on horseback, instantly the knowledgeable viewer should know whose soul the filmmaker is channeling through the powerful imagery: it is the soul of Joan of Arc. Snow White becomes Joan of Arc in the final battle scenes of the film: a young, charismatic woman, sacred, beloved by the Almighty, armored up and leading a group of knights into battle.

Trinitarian symbolism also has a prominent place throughout the film. It is seen powerfully, as one example, in the opening scene, set years into the past, when Snow White's mother, a good and beloved queen, walks through the gardens of the castle on a bright white, wintery day surrounded by snow. In the dead of winter, the queen sees a single red-rose blooming despite the cold, frozen season. Admiring the flower, she touches it and pricks her finger, as three drops of red blood fall onto the snow - the number three would remain a mystical number, returning throughout the movie.  As she notices the three drops of blood she makes a wish that she may one day have a child with lips red as blood, skin white as snow, hair as black as a raven's wing; a child possessing the same spirit and defiance as that red rose which bloomed in spite of the cold winter, in spite of all the dead surroundings. A few months later Snow White is born.

Consider here not only the Trinitarian imagery but also the story of Juan Diego and his apparitions of Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1531. He asked for a sign to give to his bishop, proving the presence of the apparitions. The sign that he was given was a bush of blooming red roses in the middle of winter in December when nothing bloomed. He was told to take the roses, folding them up in his tilma, and show them to the bishop. After Juan Diego dropped the roses at the bishop's feet his tilma opened up and the iconic image of Our Lady of Guadalupe appeared, made permanent on his tilma.

It is noteworthy that Snow White's very name speaks of an immaculate purity - snow white, she is, untouched and spotless. The imagery of this character speaks beautifully to the Woman conceived without sin who also showed up (in Mexico) after the miracle of red roses in the dead of winter.",1435795200,,7604,4.649776453055142

4729928,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I got this movie because, frankly, I'm a Chris Hemsworth fan.  He's a seriously underrated actor, but even he cannot save this movie.  I understand that this was the first full-length film directing effort by Rupert Sanders, and I'm afraid it shows.  The pacing is excruciating: for only one example, the Heroic Charge to the Castle could have been trimmed by half and we'd never miss it.  The lighting--or rather the lack of it--is far too dark.  Personally, I find it difficult to believe Kristen Stewart as ""the fairest in the land,"" particularly when contrasted with Charlize Theron. The dialog is stilted and awkward.  The only characters with any depth to them are Ravenna and Snow, with perhaps just a nod to the Huntsman (but not much of one). The ending is ... unsatisfying.  In fact, about the only positive thing I can say about this film is that it does try to feature the female characters, but I'd much rather have seen a better balance all the way around.  It's going straight to the recycle box, and I hope the entire cast finds better scripts in their morning mail.",1431302400,3,1082,4.657894736842105
4729989,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Pros:
* The visuals are fabulous. It looks like a fairy land. Very pretty everywhere you look. When it's not supposed to be, that is also very well done. It completely captures the idea that this is a fairy tale. I loved the creatures. Very imaginative.

* Charlize Theron. She's got the chops. This wasn't her finest performance, but she didn't have a ton to work with scriptwise. The actors she had to work with were also less than stellar. She looks gorgeous though.

Cons:
* The writing is horrible, particularly Snow White's rallying speech. It's incomprehensible. Also, if Snow White is supposed to defeat evil with her innocence and purity, why is she encouraging war? Why is she trying to KILL the queen? Shouldn't she be merciful and loving? (Like in Maleficent).

* Kristen Stewart. She has two looks: emotionless and constipated. There are some really stunning shots of her and some really horrid ones. In the former, you get the idea that the director finds her captivating because we see her through his eyes. In the latter, well, the camera can only show what you give it. In some she's in half shadow and I have to guess that that is because those are the better shots. She moves like a boy, has no princess air about her at all, and is just clumsy and awkward looking. She doesn't look innocent and pure. She looks a bit hung over, world wise and jaded. Not who you want for the embodiment of goodness.

I wasn't sure if it would be a kid's story. I think it is. There is some mild sex (sort of) and violence, but not blood, nudity, or grinding. This could have been so much better had the writing been better, a different Snow White were cast, and there had been different dynamics between Stewart and the director.",1431302400,,1732,4.541666666666667

4730853,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Some people may attribute the box office disappointment of this film (and I use the term dubiously when you add international ticket sales) to the scandal between actress Kristen Stewart and director Rupert Sanders. If you ask me the movie was flawed from the get go. It goes in too many directions, almost to the point each act felt like a completely different movie. Imagine turning a classic children's fairy tale into a gothic fantasy film with stints of horror and medieval warfare elements strongly added to the mix. While much of what the movie tries to get across does hit home more is lost to the schizophrenic tendencies of the script. It's not a bad film, but it falls short of what it attempts to achieve.

So the story is merely a superficial and almost forced adaptation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Snow White's world is shattered when Ravenna (Charlize Theron) lures her father/king to his death and takes over the kingdom, locking Snow White away. Years later Snow White (Kristen Stewart) escapes and is chased by Eric the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) is tasked to retrieve her, but ends up learning it's better to help her. Along the way they meet the dwarves (almost an afterthought in the script) and a lost childhood companion (Sam Claflin), who all decide to storm the castle and end Ravenna's reign. Oh yeah.. there's a magic mirror and a poison apple that are tagged in there along the way.

The script had three writers, and it shows. It's like one writer was shooting for a fantasy fable, one was shooting for gothic horror and the other wanted to remake Joan of Arc. I don't know for sure if this patchwork story was due to the writing-trinity or if it's the plan from the start. Either way it makes the movie feel fractured. It starts all dark with haunted forests, a scary sorceress and all. Then when the dwarves come into play you get scenes reminiscent of Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke. Then when you get the third act Snow White is all armored and ready lay storm the battlements. While some of these combinations melded okay others really felt like you were shifting gears to a different movie. The castle storming scenes are what really stand out. Horses charges and siege weapons at the ready. Snow White suddenly out of nowhere become a warmonger when she was (supposed to be) a dainty princess throughout the entire film. The change is sudden and off-putting. Makes the film feel like something it's not supposed to be.

Much of the Snow White fairy tale is gone. The only central concept that were kept intact were the sorceress coveting Snow White, the magic mirror, and a magic apple poisoning Snow White to an eternal sleep or death or whatever it was supposed to be. Ravenna has been given a much deeper backstory, which is one of the good things about the film. The poisoned Snow White bit feels forced. Like they had to put it in, and it only served to burn time while people mourned. Plus it didn't really make that much sense in the end when you consider who kisses her to life and where the movie goes from there. The dwarves end up just being supporting cast with almost a slight nod to the fairy tale, but that's it. If you ask me they should have just left Snow White out of it and made their own fantasy version of The Matrix what with all the ""chosen one"" themes in the film.

Imagery-wise it's a mixed bag from good to overdoing it. Sanders really wanted to make a darker story and it shows. Just about every location in the film is gloomy and dark. Even the early scenes with young Snow White before things went bad have that dark tint to it like the whole world is in perpetual twilight (no pun intended, but yes there is a similarity between the movies and how they are shot). It's not necessarily a bad thing as far as how effective the imagery is. When it does become a bad thing is when they try to add more horror-like elements with CG created creepy things. It detracts from the story and gives me the impression that focus is taken away from where it should be. It's like the creepy special effects are saying, ""HEY!! Look at me! Over here! Isn't this cool?!?!?"" and sidesteps the genuine atmosphere. There is one exception in a scene in an enchanted valley, which is very much in contrast to the rest of film. Very bright and magical. The CG effects blend with that atmosphere much better instead of trying to draw attention away from it.

And Snow White... what's the deal with her? I understand Kristen Stewart was cast due to her star appeal after doing the Twilight films, and that's the problem. She's not Snow White. She's Emo White or Goth White. The makeup is always leaned towards that ""dark"" look, which messes with the whole ""fairest of them all"" image. Sure all the animals and fairytale creatures love her, but only because it's on the script. I am not convinced of her fairest-ness when I see Stewart. I see Bella in a medieval dress. In other words she is not convincing in her role. Sure she plays the role of a princess lost in the wilderness, but not Snow White.

Acting isn't the problem in this film. You get good performances. Charlize Theron steals the show, and gets into the depth of how her character got so evil. Sam Spruell gives a complex and impressive performance as Ravenna's brother. Hemsworth is good, even if he's a bit typecast in the film. Even Stewart doesn't disappoint at face level, and I'm betting the directing has more to do with the character limitations. I can mention just about everybody in the film as being effective and good in their roles.

The Blu-Ray comes with both the original Theatrical version and an Extended Edition. The Extended Edition adds about four minutes to the film. I dare say that extra footage is helpful, but not greatly. I'm surprised they didn't just keep them in the film, unless this was a deliberate attempt to deprive movie-goers so they would buy the Extended Edition. It is presented in full 1080p HD and looks great. Audio is 7.1 DTS-HD Surround in English with 5.1 DTS Surround in French and Spanish (subtitles in all three as well). You get one 50GB Blu-Ray disc and one DVD disc. The extra features aren't bad, but some feel like fluff. Here is the list:

Audio Commentary - Director, visual effects supervisor and film editor are all together in this commentary. Mostly they speak about little details on the film's production as they go along watching it. Not bad for the fan who wants to know more.

U-Control, Picture in Picture - Basically you watch the film and now and then a pop up screen will come up with a quick interview or behind the scenes footage. I'm not much a fan of this format. I rather see the movie and then see the production notes and interviews separately.

Second Screen Experience - I enjoy this even less. Download the BLU app and sync the movie you are watching to your tablet or PC for an ""interactive"" experience. Again like to watch my films. This seems to be a distraction from that so I have never tried it.

Around the Kingdom: 360 Set Tour - This is cool, and it showcases the grand sets built for the movie. You get a full 360 degree look at King Magnus' Courtyard, the village at Tabor Castle, Duke Hammond's Castle, Queen Raveena's throne room and mirror room. I like seeing the live sets and this feature gives you an eye full.

A New Legend is Born  - This documentary is short, but goes into some detail about how the process they went in changing the classic Snow White into the film you see now. I am not a fan of film itself, but I have to admit the reasonings sound good when they tell it here.

Reinventing the Fairy Tale - Compares the fairy tale elements with the classic. Kind of a rehash of A New Legend is Born, but it does include clips of Sander's proof of concept Tone Poem reel that started this project. If you ask me they should have just shown us the whole Tone Poem. That would have been a prime feature to have on this release.

Citizens of the Kingdom - This is actually four separate featurettes about the various characters in the movie. It feels like a quick synopsis that doesn't give you too much more than what you see in the film. A lot of back-patting as well.

The Magic of Snow White and the Huntsman - This is for the special effects junkies out there. Lots of behind the scenes process of making the special effect and computer effects scenes.

D-Box compatible - If you have a D-Box motion chair this movie will move and shake with it.

Ultraviolet and Digital Copy - Both are downloads so technically there is no digital copy on the disc.

Snow White and the Huntsman is nowhere near perfect, but it's not really that bad either. If you are a fan of gothic fantasy with a little dash of horror there is a lot to love in this film. If you are a straight up fantasy fan I think this film will ultimately be acceptable. All others it really depends on how much you care about the stuff I said. If it riles you up to not like the film you very well may not like it. If it looks to you like I'm just pecking at little details then you may end up enjoying this way out there version of a storybook classic.",1423008000,,9129,4.472072072072072

4730856,5,B005LAIHSQ,"I bought this movie to see Charlize. I do not deny it and she does not disappoint at all. Some great acting chops in there to go with it. Really.
Modern movies stretch ""fairy tales"" way past their intended origins. We know, roll with it.
The modern CGI is fun and eliminates a LOT of earth polluting Styrofoam sets, which just end up in landfills. Shooting on location is less and less necessary, which saves on jets and tractor trailer pollution.
I saw nothing of Kristen Stewart previously, so my unbiased 1st impression is a very pretty girl of the modern ilk who throw themselves into the fray.  Bruises et al. Kudos to her. Charlize' face shows emotion better but she's done it longer. More little facial muscles exercised in the actors' toolbox I suppose.
I love to see the little people get gigs. Big thumbs up every time for such ""diversity"". It shouldn't take an old classic to see that happen though.",1422489600,4,910,4.58282208588957

But, in my opinion the reason why this movie is a 4, not a 5, is not because Kristen Stewart spoiled the show, as she is a beauty who could fit the Snow White role, but the problem is with the script.  It is inconsistent throughout the movie, and there are scenes that appear for a few seconds without any discernable purpose. The script has Snow White channeling Margret of Anjou, which is odd for young princess maiden who has been locked away most of her life and is known for her  kindness. The Evil Queen, Charlize Theron, gives an over-the-top performance that is truly enjoyable to watch - you almost want her to continue her reign.  The Huntsman, is perfectly played as an adorable, take-me-home bad boy that women continually fall for in spite of obvious flaws.

Kristen Stewart's involvement in the movie is about as active as a tumbleweed blowing through the desert.  She exists, but doesn't provide any real value.  The main storyline of the movie could have been done in about 30 minutes, the rest is just fluff with confusing storyline forks that don't resolve that only serve the purpose of filling time.",1416096000,,434,5.070422535211268

4731961,5,B005LAIHSQ,"This is definitely a nice twist to the Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs. It stays true to it but it is a twist that brings out more of the Snow White character. In fact all of the characters are expanded. But yes, there are still seven dwarfs in it.
Chris Hemsworth is very good as the Huntsman. He is a very believable character because of the superb acting he does. And Charlize Theron is great as the evil queen. And Kristen Stewart is a very good pick for Snow White. These 3 do a very good job of bringing you into the movie. And the supporting cast brings you in even more. I liked the addition of the Queen's brother & their portrayal of the Magic Mirror. And the Duke & his son, William are also very good additions to the movie.
You have a well rounded set of characters brought to life by good acting by the actors along with a new view of Snow White along with the Seven Dwarfs. The action is well done as are the special effects, of which there are not an overwhelming set of.
This is a great movie to have in your collection & a very enjoyable one to watch.

I thought the huntsman had some funny lines...some of the funniest lines in the whole movie actually. The woman playing the queen seemed to over act. I mean, she was good, but she could've toned it down a tad and still been good. I don't think that Kristin Stewart was really all that bad as Snow White. I haven't seen any of the Twilight movies, because I don't like those types of movies. She may not have been the best choice for the part and she could've done a little better in the part, but I don't think it's all her fault. I think that for what she was given to work with and the story of Snow White, she was average to a little above average. I think it could've been worse.

Aside from the fact that well, he's THOR, he actually has character and moral depth & is more deserving of empathy than Snow White, in my opinion.  You sorta feel sorry for the witch, well, for a whole 10 seconds.  She and her brother weren't really asked if they wanted the powers, but they definitely used them to their advantage and for evil.  So, oh well.  It was an odd take on the whole Snow White fairy tale and worth the watch just because it wasn't the same ole Snow White story.  But, it was definitely not for kids that get nightmares easily and not something I would own.  Cheap Prime rental, yes.  Home movie library, no.",1414108800,,762,4.385714285714286

4732386,5,B005LAIHSQ,"I've finally found the urge to see this particular film, and I must say, I actually liked it. I mean after everything that went on with this film in theaters and during the actual shooting, it was actually a lot better than I had imagined it would be. For me, for the most part, it turned out to be one of those films I'd wished I'd seen in theaters.
I feel that Kristen Stewart did a pretty decent job portraying the innocence of a young maiden as well as the fierceness of a brave warrior as Snow White. She got my attention there. Sure she could've been given a little more to work with with her character, but nonetheless ""good job"" on her part. The use of the dwarfs did have mixed signals with me. Though they do their best in the film, partially serving for the lighthearted funny parts, pretty good job there, but should they have used actual little people versus using actors downsized by cgi effects, yeah they probably should've. But you do have to admit it was a neat effect. I thought Charlize Theron was just a ""little bit"" over the top as the evil queen (sort of actually did scare me somewhat), but a memorable one nonetheless.
And all I have left to say about this film is that it does have that sort of unique vigorous feel that makes this film such an epic, especially for the last third of the film. But I give all that credit to Roth Films productions. And I strongly feel that there should ought to be a sequel (or two to form a trilogy with this film), because I'd like to see where things go and to see more of Snow White in action and what choices she makes. But don't take my word for it. If you haven't seen this film already, just at least give it a shot and see what you think about it all. But me, I enjoyed this one.",1412985600,,1747,4.2023809523809526
4732387,2,B005LAIHSQ,Charlize Theron does a great job but i seriously thought they did a poor job picking the actress for snow white. no offense to you twihards that love Kristen Stewart for life. but unfortunately her acting is still subpar after years of acting. not to mention the story of snow white is that the evil queen is jealous of her beauty. But i find it very hard to think of Kristen  prettier then Charlize. Overall it's a good story line and it is overall a good movie. But i just can't look past the glaring flaw of Kristen Stewart.,1412985600,,527,4.3232323232323235

4732426,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Speechless due to nausea in regard to the storyline. I was utterly disappointed in Charlize Theron for accepting this role and disappointed in myself for watching it in it's entirety. I am fairly certain that certain of my brain cells screamed to end the torture before exploding in painful deaths. I ended up with a migraine for two days. I blame it on Snow White and The Huntsman.  That being said, i give three glorious stars to Chris Hemsworth for selflessly lending his Godsome physique to this tiresome film and for having the strength of Zeus, Hercules, and of course Thor, to put up with Kristen and her bizarre mouth.  I <3 u Chris but next time time should you encounter Snow White follow the queens orders and kill her. Better yet don't except the role of huntsmen...ever.  Overall, a bad film.

Often it's the actors in feature, or sometimes the storyline itself that interests me.  When Siskel and Ebert  were doing their picks, I realized rather early on that if they liked one, it was fairly certain I wouldn't care for it.  Yet on the other hand, if they did not find it appealing, more than likely I'd find I was sure to enjoy it.  For years they were the 'weathervane' by which my film viewing enjoyment was selected.",1407196800,,537,4.393939393939394

4732843,3,B005LAIHSQ,"This is definitely a decent piece of fluff with some really spectacular performances (Wow, Charlize Theron is scary).  However, as much as I try to like her, Kristen Stewart continues to baffle me.  She is beautiful and looks the part in this one, but this is supposed to be a strong female character.  Aside from a few shouts that almost sound sincere, she puts no depth into this character, leaving to the unfortunate conclusion that it really is all about her good looks. (I have more appreciation for Lily Collins in Mirror Mirror now.) The little love triangle that emerges is just plain confusing, but the great performances by Chris Hemsworth and Sam Claflin bring a life to the film that makes it all fine, especially as it builds to the final battle.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys new takes on the old fairy tales, but I would caution not to expect a whole lot from Snow White herself.",1407024000,,918,4.613496932515337

Everything is judge by primal sense of sight and that's image, so the same is said for the movie. The movie is a visual bait for an out come that's weakly developed and lacking.

There are many people whom rated it more sincerely then others. Maybe the others are just the shallow ones.
The movie stands at great and interesting at first, finding yourself engaged with it from the beginning but tit then swells to a resounding, ""well? What happened to the consistency.?
Lacks consistency from where it starts interesting at the beginning but draws a flat line.
I'm not a fan no where close to liking Twilight. No love for silly vampires or werewolves but a good show. This one was only good into it goes ""flat line.""
I think its a waste for it looked very promising of a movie if kept consistent.

4733533,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White and the Huntsman is a film that is part of a large movement in recent years to revisit the classic fairy tale canon, often applying a bit of a darker twist to the versions that many of us grew up with.  SWatH succeeds at being a good action fantasy film, one that does not ask or require its audience to think too hard.  There was a bit of controversy regarding the personal relationship between Kristen Stewart and the film's director, and also over the use of slight of hand to make actors appear to be dwarfs, rather than casting actual dwarfs.
Ignoring the controversies, the dwarfs are one of the better aspects of the film, and you will find yourself smiling, though perhaps not actually laughing, at some of their jokes and banter.  Charlize Theron has the best performance in the film by far, doing an excellent job of playing the evil queen.  Her character's motivations are also more believable than the typical evil tyrant, as she seems to rule with a black hand to strike back at the unfairness of the male dominated world and with a bit of girl power gone wrong.  The film does seem to take a bit long in establishing the evil nature of Theron's queen, almost portraying her as too evil, as she laughs at peasants fighting for fountain water and sucking souls from youthful maidens.
The film establishes Stewart as a dominant force of good and purity.  Stewart does little to make us care or root for her, beyond the other characters in the film, almost all men, fawning over her as potential savior.  Some of the lines that establish her credentials are a bit forced.
The film keeps its two leading ladies apart for the length of the script, although their eventual meeting ends a bit quicker than one would like and its climax is quite predictable.  Fans of Stewart will enjoy seeing her in a knight's armor perhaps.  One also leaves with the feeling that a younger Theron could have played the part of Snow White as well as she played the evil queen.
There are some nice special effects in the film.  Overall, not a bad way to spend two hours.  SWatH is perhaps the best film entry in the recent 'updated fairy tales' genre, which does mean that a good film is out there somewhere, ready to take that title.",1401321600,,2234,4.518610421836228

For two hours + I got to watch a story of another time. Another place. I will tell you what I told my friends who I encouraged to watch it after I did. ' With a good therapist and appropriate medications this whole mess could have been avoided.' No story *shrugs* but the King wouldn't have been murdered on his wedding night, Snow White wouldn't have spent years locked in a tower and so on. But there wasn't. Gaagh that was real life invading.

A good action flick that I'll most certainly watch again, if for nothing else, the amazing special effects!",1398038400,,439,4.395061728395062

4733732,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I love a good dark retelling of a fairy tale where there is not always a happy ending, the way it is in real life.  This movie was a great retelling of a well known story, and the special effects are incredible.  The casting of Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna was genius, and I think she deserved an Oscar for this role.  She truly was the best part of the movie despite the fact that she was the villain.  Chris Hemsworth did a great job too, and seems to be working hard to be more than just Thor.  This was also the first full length film for director Rupert Sanders and he did an amazing job for a film as ambitious as this one.  Unfortunately the producers cast Kristen Stewart in the title role, and that girl cannot act. The few movies that I have seen her in are just as bad acting wise, but she is still riding the coattails of the successful Twilight movies, but that seems to be coming to an end.  Thankfully this movie was great enough that I could mostly ignore her ineptitude.  She is the reason that I did not give this film 5 stars.  I have heard that they are planning to make a sequel, but due to Stewart's and Sanders affair (he was married) there is speculation that only one of them can return for it.  PLEASE let it be Sanders.  Many films in the past have had everything going for it from cast to costumes,  but without a great director leading all of those will mean nothing.  Watch the movie, I believe that it appeals to all types of people,  but like I said ignore Stewart's bad acting",1397779200,,1522,4.221453287197232

4733804,3,B005LAIHSQ,"The images in the movie are stunning and it is well worth renting.  The story does not flow well and there are great leaps the writers make you take to figure out what is going on.  Some major questions you will be left with: Why does Snow White have special power?  How does Snow White come out of prison healthy?  How can Snow White be a fierce warrior at the end?
  Best parts: the evil Queen Charlize Theron, the huntsman Chris Hemsworth, the idea of a new take on Snow White, the Dwarves and fairies.  The Dwarves and fairies are the most interesting characters, they just aren't developed
  Worst parts: the script, Kristen Stewart, the potential this movie had that was wasted",1397520000,,683,4.532786885245901

Although I personally am not as taken with Kristen Stewert as the rest of the planet seems to be, she is adequate.

If you aren't the same...well, good for you for showing more maturity than me :).  Considering the director and Kristen Stewart engaged in affairs while/after working on this movie together, I didn't think I would ever support this movie or them two financially.  When a close friend from out of town came to stay the weekend, she requested a movie night with this being the main title of interest.  I voiced my usual disdain for all things Kristen Stewart, but being the gracious host that I am, I agreed to the purchase.  I wanted to hate this movie.  Oh boy did I try...but I failed.  Charlize Theron as the evil queen was not something I would've ever picked myself, but once the movie started, the casting made perfect sense.  She stole the show!  She truly is the fairest of them all, and the mirror must have been joking on the day he said otherwise.  They should change the title to include, ""All hail the evil queen"".  Kristen Stewart is not her usual awkward self, and she is truly believable in this role.

4733969,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Admittedly, I was unable to see the end of this movie because I couldn't stand the idea of Kristen Stewart killing the goddess Charlize Theron. It was simply more than I could bear.

I almost didn't see it at all because of Kristen. But Theron brought me around enough to get through most of it.

It sickens me to think of all the money Kristen has made with that bitchy little PMS attitude that she plays in EVERY single movie she's ever been in. She has no range in acting skills whatsoever.  And if she doesn't pull it together soon, I hope people will realize that they are paying money to see her be the exact same character over and over again.

Everything else about this movie left me pleasantly surprised that this version worked as well as it did.",1394150400,,757,4.385714285714286
4733970,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Let's start with a question that kept going through my mind as I watched this movie...why do all ""fairy tales"" have a ""black forest?""  The idea of an evil area filled with trees seem to play a major role in every tale. This led to my second question I kept asking...why can't Stewart act her way out of a paper bag?
As many have already stated, the script is just dreadful...possibly one of the worse scripts ever for a fantasy/horror/sci fi movie one will ever have to sit threw. Theron and Helmsworth to their best in trying to make lemonade from lemons...even as gifted actors they are, they are having issues, but they try, they try. Stewart we will leave for later.
The sets, effects and cinematography are worth the price of the movie, it is visually a stunning piece of cinema. This may be the sole reason I gave this 4 stars. What lacks in script and to an extent acting, it makes up in the visual.
Theron and Helmsworth as I previously stated do their best with what they have to work with...Theron plays villain extremely well and even when she is suppose to be ""ugly"" she still is beautiful. Helsworth is just beautiful, he plays the reluctant hero to a perfection. I am being partial as I like both actors body of work. Once again, they have the ability, all be it minor, to make lemonade out of this lemon of a script.
Then there is Stewart. T call her an actor is an insult to the craft. If you hated her in the Twilight series, you will loathe her in this. First and foremost, as in Twilight, all she can do is stare with a blank expression into the camera, and there there is the ""tick"" sound she makes when she is not sure what to do, what her line is, or has to emote. She did it all through Twilight and she does it throughout this movie. Perhaps it is her ""signature"" trademark...whatever it is, it is all she is able to do as an ""actor.""  Poor Theron and Helmsworth look exhausted in the scenes they are in with her...and for Helsworth that is a fair part of the movie. (Oh, before I forget the ""extended"" version is too long, especially with Stewart...watch the theatrical version instead.) Anyway, back to Stewart bashing...also, to say she is fairer than Theron is a stretch at best, and a lie in the least. Why do people thinks she is attractive, she is not. So for her to play the ""fairest of them all"" plays against type. But then as in Twilight, there must be something 20 year old boys like in her, though I am completely clueless as to the answer.
So, in ending, this is a great movie from a cinematography standpoint, a good movie if you like the work of Theron and Helmsworth and a dreadful movie in terms of script and pacing (again, skip the extended version) and as far as Stewart...enough said.",1394064000,2,2730,4.372047244094488

She is to be life of this earth and the movie. yet, she looks dead inside. only time she looks beautiful and serene when she is on her death bed. Her mouth finally closed, eyes closed and not performing... thank you makeup team.

Definitely recommend for those who like fantasy & fairy tales.

4734424,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I loved the idea of a new take on Snow White.  The concept is awesome, the actors are all good or great, but they forgot to write a good script.
GOOD: the idea, the visually stunning landscape, some decent battles (but not as many as you are led to believe), Charlize Theron's character.  They have some fun and unique things, like the fairies-but they are only shown for a few minutes.  The Dwarves are cool, but don't come in for the first hour and are not in the movie as much as they should be.
BAD: moves slowly, there are massive breaches in the script: I will give a few of the many examples with spoilers: 1. Snow White (Stewart) is locked in a dungeon for most of her childhood and into young adulthood-yet, she is well fed, healthy, articulate and sane. 2. The script can't decide if Kristen is a damsel in distress or a super hero destined for greatness- examples were too numerous to label all.  But she needs the huntsman's' help, no he needs hers, she can't survive the dark forest without him, she can repel a troll with her bad breath and constipated stare, she has been locked in a dungeon with no human contact for decade plus with no military training, but plans the final assault on the evil queen with bold strategy and a speech from Braveheart.  She can lead an army but has to be ""saved"" by the huntsman's kiss (I really thought they would change this if they were going to change the story of the helpless snow white.  3.  They portray the evil queen as all powerful and she can instantly kill a man from five feet away, but Snow can defeat her?  They build up the queen for 2 hours and 5 minutes then all of a sudden she is easy to kill?  She is left virtually unguarded?  4.  Snow White's character is schizophrenic, one minute weak and pathetic, the next an excellent swordsman after a ten second lesson from the huntsman (she fights through a dozen or so guards to get to the shockingly unprotected queen.  5.  Once the dwarves are in the gatehouse, only a couple of the queen's guard come to fight them?  What?  Makes no sense.  There are many other examples.
  Overall, wish I would have rented it, it is fun to watch once, but the negatives are too many to want to watch again.",1388016000,,2208,4.356968215158925

4734428,3,B005LAIHSQ,"So we all know that Kristen Stewart is a less than stellar actress. She might be kinda pretty...maybe (Charlize Theron is prettier), but let's face it. She lacks something when she gets in front of the camera. This movie was no exception to that rule either. For those of you who are looking for a GOOD movie with some romance, adventure, and a little scariness, you may continue your search. Though this movie possesses those things, it certainly isn't GOOD. The worst thing about this waste of money and time was that at the end the camera zooms in on Snow White, then it zooms in on the prince, then it zooms in on the huntsman who woke her from her sleep. The music comes to a climax and the screen goes black. She never made the choice between the prince or the huntsman. really guys? is Miss Stewart only allowed to be in movies where she can't make a decision between two guys? that's just lame. in short, DON'T WATCH!",1387756800,4,925,4.415204678362573

She is everything I used to imagine the evil queen as being when I was little: coldly beautiful, incredibly intelligent and calculating, and chillingly vicious. Charlize Theron is, by far, the best Evil Queen I have ever watched.

So if you only want awesome evil queen, this movie is great.

Otherwise, no so much. Acting, scripts, just about everything else was ghastly. Costumes were pretty cool, and the imagery was lovely. But. Snow White basically looked lost and confused the whole time, and the Huntsman could have said nothing the entire movie (his lines added that much depth to the story).",1387411200,,710,5.05982905982906

4734489,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Making a more serious, not really children oriented version of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", was a great idea - but it was not very well made and the result is an only half-successful film, saved from total failure by incredible performance of Charlize Theron. This review contains some limited SPOILERS.

The story is of course very well known and in its main lines this film sticks to it, so there is no real need to tell it again here. However the story was changed very much as far as the character and the background of the Evil Queen (Charlize Theron) are concerned. In this film she has a name (Ravenna) and a past, of which I will say only that it is radically feminists...))) She is also much, much more powerful than in the 1937 film and even than in the original Grimm's tale. In this film she is a REALLY powerful sorceress, well versed in the darkest magic and using it massively, both to extend her already unnaturaly long life and to maintain her power over the land. But, and that was a really excellent idea, in the same time she is a poison to the land - the dark magic she uses makes the whole once flourishing country sick...

Charlize Theron is THE reason for which this thing is even watchable. Her Ravenna is a really terrifying creature, feeding on life force of young maidens and rotten insides of dead birds, maintaining an incestuous relation with her own brother (""Game of Thrones"" anybody?) when in the same time clearly hating men, using dagger, poison, hexes and legions of henchmen with same deadly skill, etc. She is a real delight to watch!

Snow White was changed deeply too, from a damsel in distress awaiting her prince to a shield-maiden leading her army to war. The general idea was not so bad, but the execution of it was really not terrific... The responsability here lays both with the scenario and with Kristen Stewart's acting. I must here precise that not only I am one of the few hetero-sexual males who actually liked the ""Twilight"" saga but I also rather liked the way Kristen Stewart played Bella Swan, a troubled, clumsy, introverted teenager. The great problem is that in this film she didn't really try to portray the Upgraded Butt-kicking Fully-Armored Snow White but just... another Bella Swan. And that really hurt this film. Also let's be honest here - Kristen Stewart is not half bad looking but any magic mirror which would consider her fairer than Charlize Theron is certainly in a dire need of deep magico-psychiatrico-ophtalmological revision...)))

The Huntsman also has now a bigger role in the story. Chris Hemsworth plays him here as basically a slightly downgraded Thor with some Han Solo elements. Initially there were thoughts about a sequel and therefore the Huntsman was supposed to develop feelings for Snow White and the setting for a love triangle was even established - but the total lack of any magnetism between Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Stewart is so obvious here that any possible romance between those two seem to be absolutely excluded.

The dwarfs are OK I guess, with a good role of Bob Hoskins as their leader. The are of course also very different from the dwarfs from both 1937 movie and from the original story - they are also not exactly nice characters.

The film contains one unnecessary scene of travelling through sewers, with a very explicit explanation in WHAT exactly the characters are swimming. Honestly, it grossed me out...

Bottom line, this film is watchable, but mostly for Charlize Theron. Most of the scenes with other characters, you can fast forward without losing much. A film to see once (if at all).",1386547200,,3614,4.736089030206677

Then they ruined the movie, for me by making a love interest between Snow White and the Huntsman, up until that point it really felt like a father daughter bond. The hunts man could have found redemption in that fatherly role. I am not a Kristen Stewart fan, but she did ok in this movie. Charlize Theron as always was mesmerizing. I liked Mirror Mirror more, though they are completely different in mood. This is a drama more atune to the original grim fairytale, the other is a comedy for entertainment purposes, but unlike most movie adaptations Mirror Mirror did not take liberties with the foundational plot line like Snow white and the Huntsman did. Why does Hollywood believe the only defining relationships that exist between unrelated people of the opposite gender have to be romantic in nature?

4734830,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I'm amazed that so many people decided to review this movie.  I don't know that it warrants that much scrutiny, possible praise, or well deserved condemnation.  For me, there wasn't much to generate an opinion in the first place.  It's an ambitious, spiritless, CGI-fest stretched beyond all endurance.  That it took four people to pen the screenplay says a lot about the way the story meanders aimlessly, employing the `stacked deck' theory of writing, until it finally fizzles with a whimper of an ending.  The other part of the problem is deciding which lead actress to blame for an outstanding show of mediocrity.  Most of Charlize Theron's performance is due to special effects and a great deal of posing, otherwise she only hit two notes, screeching ineffectively and just standing there trying to look pretty.  Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, did nothing to inspire that much devotion, she is simply incapable of emoting with any amount of credibility.  That they are planning a sequel with her in the starring role begs the question why.  This movie already took forever to leave out the happily ever after finale, what more to the story can they add, a secret sister with a grudge, planning to take over with Theron failed?
It should be noted that Chris Hemsworth did most of the heavy lifting in this epic; otherwise, it's just a dreary mess.

4735046,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Your Bowling for Movies Score: 128.25 of 300

I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.

Snow White and The Huntsman - we own the Blu Ray, DVD, Digital Copy, and Ultraviolet ""Extended Edition""

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
Not your great-great-great gandfather's fairytale - retold, rebooted, reworked, re-engineered, and reimagined once for children, now for teens epic story following the harrowing tale of a depressed and moody, soon to be thrust into greatness Princess Bella, er, I mean Snow White (Kristen Stewart), as she takes flight from imprisonment by her evil stepmother, Mr. F, I mean Ravenna (Charlize Theron) and is first hunted by and then assisted by hunky axe wielding super-hero Thor, er, Eric The Huntsman, just Huntsman to his friends (Chris Hemsworth).  I would be found wanting if I didn't mention the once noble gem and precious metal miners, turned highway robbers better known as the seven dwarves lead by Black Beard himself, DBA Beith (Ian MacShane).

Overall, this movie made me sad... it had real potential and was simply undone by uneven acting.  I liked the story, I liked the CGI, I liked the epic scale, heck - I even think there was some genuinely good acting.  You can read plenty of complaints about Kristen Stewart's poor performance.  The fact that she won both The Teen Choice Award aaand a Golden Raspberry is positive evidence of why we don't hold teens legally responsible and seal their records once they become adults.  If her flat, lifeless acting doesn't get you - the fact that she goes cockeyed every time she goes in for a kiss really should.  Charlize Theron helped every step of the way with her over-the-top portrayal of Ravenna, the evil stepmother.  I had to sit and ponder other reviewers positive take on Charlize and I finally had to just to realize that the writers must have forgotten a few letters when describing her as mesmerizing and operatic...  what I witnessed was indeed mesmerizing(ly bad) and (needlessly) operatic.  I saw some great acting - Sam Spruell did a wonderful job as Finn, Ravenna's brother and according to my wife, Chris Hemsworth's fancy fighting really inspired her.  She said he had the nicest ax she's seen in quite sometime (I didn't even know she liked wood chopping implements).  At the end of the day, I can forgive the casting of Stewart - hey, they are trying to cash in on Twilight fans between movies, I get that.  I cannot forgive the mistakes made by the casting and directing of Charlize Theron.  Ok movie dude - if you didn't already own it, would you buy this movie?  The answer, yes (if it was on sale).  :]

What I loved:
1.  It's a good reboot - the additions to the beloved fairytale were spot on and made sense
2.  It's beautiful to behold - the scene with The Great White Stag was awe-inspiring to name just one
3.  It was refreshing to see something other than just a comic book hero in their 12th reboot on the screen... how many times can we watch Spiderman or Superman on the screen  (if you build a better movie, they will come)
4.  Gives a perfect example of why you only eat mushrooms from the grocery store and not pick your own at the park... wow, every so often I breath in a piece of lint and that's bad but nothing compared to the mushroom spores in this movie

What I did NOT like:
1.  If this is a German fairytale why is Kristen Stewart breaking in and out of an English accent thru the entire thing?
2.  Did I mention Kristen Stewart?
3.  Charlize Theron (did I mention Kristen Stewart?)

Tales from the medieval era through the Napoleonic era were far more records of horror than fantasy, when people suffered so that a few would enjoy the embellishments of life with organized religion saying little to nothing while basking in its own torturous Inquisition.

4735286,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Hollywood seems intent on taking every single classic story and making them grittier. It seems like Hollywood thinks we need a ""realistic"" version of fairy tales and that realism = gritty violence.

The formula sometimes works but not as often as Hollywood thinks. In this case, I think it's a partial success. I think the grittier aspects sometimes work. I love the new dwarves. They have a much more forceful personality. They're a bit off-putting, which I think actually works for dwarves as they're from the fantasy realm. There's also a good mix of dwarf characters, from the grungy to the more mystical.

The wicked Queen on the other hand is a mixed bag. Charlize Theron is wonderful in her performance. She manages to add a layer of pain and frustration underneath the surface of what could easily have been a one-dimensional villain. However, the attempts to give her greater powers fell flat. First, seeing her suck the ""youth"" of of people was a bit silly. Second, the special effects have that CGI look (note to directors: use CGI sparingly. CGI rarely looks realistic). The scene of her taking a ""milk bath"" really pulled me out of the film as it just looked like early 1990s computer animation.

Kristen Stewart as Snow White is OK, but not exactly memorable. One gets the sense that she's a passive character in the movie, possibly because Stewart doesn't bring the character much weight.

The pacing of the movie is also off. It's clear that the director had trouble in the editing room and not surprisingly there is an extended version (which I haven't seen). Some scenes seem far too short, almost pointless. Others, such as the introduction of the Huntsman, don't have much impact. I suspect the romantic connection between the Huntsman and Snow White was also a victim of editing as it's not even clear why his kiss would be the one to wake her up. If I'd liked the movie a bit more, I definitely would try to get the extended version. Unfortunately, the distributor only allows Netflix to send the theatrical version.

Small point - if the whole crux of the plot is that the wicked Queen feels threatened by Snow White's beauty, then it would have been helpful to have had an actress who was more beautiful than Charlize Theron play Snow White. Despite the age difference, Kristen Stewart just doesn't hold a candle to Charlize Theron in that department. It's not a big deal, but does kind of undermine the movie's narrative.

I started the disc and we waited and waited and waited for the thing to start as it went to the Internet over and over again.  After 15 minutes we gave up.
Today I tried it again.  After 10-15 minutes of connecting to the Internet through my wired Ethernet connect, the main menu started.  Great!

I ended up stopping the disk, restarting it and waiting another 15 minutes for it to grind its way back to the main menu.  As others have pointed out, the movie is simply not worth it.

I loved the guy who played the Huntsman, and since he was on-screen a lot, this movie was wonderful.  And to be fair, Snow White had some pretty kick-ass qualities and the evil stepmother/Queen was pretty darn scary.

I would have given this a 5-star rating if it hadn't been for the scenes with the Dwarves. They were just really odd and cheesy; one of them was blind but seemed to have an extra sense and could tell what was going on all the time, there was a lot of time wasted wandering around an enchanted forest, and I guess we were supposed to feel sad when one of the dwarves died, but the emotional connection really wasn't that well-built.

Kristen Stewart's acting in this film was far better than her acting in Twilight, so overall, it was worth watching. But I might choose to fast-forward through the scenes with the dwarves when watching it in the future.",1371772800,,957,4.451428571428571

4735569,5,B005LAIHSQ,SnowThis is not your typical Disney movie. This movie has Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemmsworth and Charlize Theron. This is heart pounding action and great action. I recommend everybody to get this movie.,1371081600,,204,5.212121212121212
4735570,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This version of Snow White focuses on her relationship with the huntsman of legends, presenting a more active Snow White. The tale focuses on themes of people who will not let go of their youth and power at the expenses of others or perhaps the lengths one will go to preserve their looks. Is this a subtle attack on plastic surgery?

The images, cinematography and music are very good or better. The story, like many Hollywood films, is a few notches down and the characters and dialogue are in between the two previous mentioned elements. Charlize Theron, who plays the evil queen, does an exemplary job in presenting herself as a viable antagonist who is more than a villain in black. Kristin Stewart (best known as Bella from the controversial TWILIGHT series) plays a Messiah like Snow White, Chris Hemsworth plays an adequate Huntsman from the fairy tales and a couple of the dwarves are notable actors, too (Ian McShane and Ray Winstone).

For those familiar with the Snow White legends (and if you're not where have you been?) this takes a non-Disney approach trying to make this accessible for adults especially and to a lesser extent children. I don't see much of a reason to cover the story as it's well known and all the websites are already doing it.

The budget for this film was $170M and it made over $396M at the Box Office. Based on the famous fairy tale, ""Snow White"", by Brothers Grimm. A sequel was planned but got delayed when the director (who was married) slept with Stewart and got caught.

This picture was nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Costume Design.

Why the hate from some reviewers? They don't like change and are expecting Shakespeare.

4735675,3,B005LAIHSQ,"much like the twilight movies its not so much that they are really really bad its just it wasn't much better than really bad. the writing was less than fantastic, less than alright. the writing was flat out terrible. However, the cinematography was beyond expectation. the performances mostly were at least alright and i was suprisingly pleased to see both Bob Hoskins and Ian McShane even if it was only for a few minutes altogether. I think they are two fabulous actors and while the writing was ghastly and the parts were suprisingly small (no pun intended)they made the best of their ten minute appearance. the writing was bad enough i was suprised to see either of those two as well as Charlize Theron. Now coming to our key cast, I appreciated the slight scottish brogue that our hero had but felt it didn't add much and possibly it would have been better without. other than that he was a highlight although I prefered him as Thor. maybe its the cocky arrogance he pulled off so well yet still was like-able. Charlize Theron did well. She was possibly the only person fully invested in her role. and Kristin Stewart, well I can't help but feel the good reviews she has thus far gotten for this movie come from either her parent's friends, her staff, and the many twi-hards who don't hate her for ruining the fantasy about bella and edward out there. she played the same role she always plays with a less than believable vague british accent. this movie was trying to be to way too dark and too serious with a large budget focusing on a relatively untalented person. If you want a dark snow white movie watch Snow White :A Tale of Terror. the acting is at least as good and snow white herself is considerably better still maybe no oscar winner but better. the movie all around is better according to me. not saying its a good movie just a better version of the same story. which oh yeah who ever wrote this knocked that movie off somewhat at least as far as snow white falling for the other guy rather than the prince.",1370476800,,2024,4.502717391304348

4735757,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Okay, so to preface this review, I should mention that I started watching this movie, knowing that it had gotten mixed reviews on this site. Therefore, I was not expecting to be blown away by performances or bored out of my mind while watching it. Neither of those things happened for me. Granted, the first 20 minutes or so were a bit slow-paced for me, but after that, the pace was fine for me. It would definitely be a mistake for anyone to get this movie, expecting it to be kid-friendly. Like some people have mentioned in their reviews, the fact that Kristen Stewart (Snow White) always had the same expression on her face throughout the entire movie was probably the one minor setback in terms of acting. Charlize Theron (The Evil Queen) was without a doubt captivating as the villainous character of the film. I truly did find myself despising her character the whole time. That does not happen too often for me when I'm watching a movie unless the actor is so good at portraying the character. Chris Hemsworth (The Huntsman) did a pretty decent job in his role as the protector of Snow White. I'd have to say that metaphorically-speaking, I walked away from this movie awestruck--in a good way. It's not easy to say who I would recommend this film to. People who don't like Kristen Stewart will likely avoid seeing it. I suppose if you are a fan of action-packed, dark drama-type movies, this movie will appeal to you.

4735762,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I bought this film for one reason--Charlize Theron.  I guess that will teach me!  I played this DVD once and then a second time with the hearing impaired dialog turned on.  What a mess!  After viewing this thing twice I went to the computer and looked up some reviews of this film.  I can only agree it is a confusing mess.  When the film starts out a voice over says he is Eric and goes on to describe the prolog to the film.  We never hear the name again.  Turns out Eric is the Huntsman of the title.  But during the film he is never called by his name--just the Huntsman.  Accents come and go during the film, especially during moments of anger or stress.  This is what we have here.  A US-British production of a German fairy tale.  Most if not all the production team is British.  We have an Australian actor mumbling his lines with a British Medieval accent as the lead.  The female lead (Kristen Stewart) has an American accent, though as a little girl has a decidedly British accent.  And Charlize's accent comes and goes with anger and stress, but is fairly strong when not.  One of the minor characters is named Greta a German name, but a British accent.  And that is just the accents.  I would recommend that you switch on the hearing impaired dialog so you can understand what is being said.  Otherwise it can be confusing.

4735876,5,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie isn't really for kids.  It's dark and relentless and amazing.

I had heard such bad things about it, and about Kristen Stewart, that I had low expectations.

I am happy to report that they, and I, were wrong.

It's great.

First, Kristen Stewart is fine.  I had only seen her in one film, Panic Room, and there she was a child and the role didn't require much.  But here she is good.  She registers a whole panoply of emotions from dread to ferocity to doubt to panic to despair to budding confidence to confusion to remorse to awe.  Most surprising, she shows herself to be a great physical actor: her lunges and slides and tumbles are really good.

Charlize Theron is good, too.  After her horrid sleepwalking performance in Prometheus, I thought she had lost it.  Not so.  Here she is perfect.  She even overacts, which is precisely right for the role.

Chris Hemsworth is wonderful.  He's not just a hunk; he can act.  Even do humor.

And the Seven Dwarfs are amazing.  I could hardly believe my eyes.  Ray Winstone???!!!  Eddie Marsan???!!!  And Bob Hoskins??????????!!!!!  Terrific.  I don't know how they made these guys into dwarves, but they are spectacular.

And the whole look of the movie is great.  Grueling and dark most of the time, then flowering into brightness in the land of the fairies, and glimmering toward the end.  All of this is thematic, of course.  The struggle of the Good Earth Mother/Life Force (Snow White) against the Evil Earth Mother/Vampire Force (Ravenna), bringing the earth back to life after a long period of death.

And the bird-theme is brilliant.

All in all a wonderful movie.  Unlike any Snow White you've ever seen.",1368835200,4,1671,4.697916666666667

However I have to date seen a Kristen Stewart movie that does not make me want to throw the remote or popcorn at the screen in massive frustration.  Finally I sat down and watched it.  I was amazed by the special effects and CG work! Also Theron and Hemsworth held there own in making the film good.  Theron especiallly did a wonderful job in putting depth in her character.  It almost makes the movie worth watching, almost.  Then Kristen Stewart strikes again.

I really did try to give her a chance.  I sat there there the whole movie saying to myself 'she will show some emotion, she has to show some emotion.' Nope there was no emotion to be found.  The farther along in the movie I got the more frustrated I became.  I kept shouting at the screen 'Kristen really? Smile, frown, scream do something!!!' I felt incredibly bad for Hemsworth who tried so hard to get her to act.  I kept encouraging him though the movie to not give up and maybe he could get her to act her role.  Oh well so much for lost causes.

Again Theron did a specatular job and made the movie worth watching.  I would suggest watching most of the movie on mute and just focus on the effects because they really are excellent!

4736159,1,B005LAIHSQ,"First of all, I apologize for all my future dangling sentences...I am not a good writer and English is not my first or second language..  Here are some of the things I have to say about this movie.
1.  It felt like someone with a desire to make a great movie found lots of money and made this movie without having an expert in screen writing, editing, or story telling..
2.  Kristen whatcmacallher..  she really needs to take some acting classes..  I felt like I was watching a Keanu Reeves in Kristen Stewart's body..She sucked at every move she made and every word she uttered..
3.  Why try to invent a wheel when it is already invented?  Snow white is already a story... from beginning to end..why not use the original story?

Now, let me elaborate on each item.  1.  Why did it feel like someone with a desire to make a great movie found lots of money and made this movie without having an expert help in screen writing, editing, or story telling.. Because, I strongly believe that there isn't a person in this world who doesn't know the story of Snow White..  Ok, maybe there is, but probably 100% of people of the western world knows this story..In Snow White there is a part when she goes to 6 dwarfs house and falls a sleep and that's how the first meeting happens.  In this movie, the dwarfs are portrayed as bunch of loser, punk, low life bandits..Why? what purpose does that portrayal serve?  I don't get it...In order for dwarfs to have loyalty towards her, there has to be the time when she cooks, cleans and makes delicious food to win their hearts..  This is a vital process in the story, why kill it?  And if you kill it, what do you place it with?  The answer is nothing...  this is when story teller could help the movie maker, or  editor..or whoever does this job..  The special effects in the movie was great.. but the story lacked substance..  then the Huntsman...  when did he have time to fall in love with Snow White?  What did I miss?  And Snow White's childhood friend.. I thought he was in love with her...Even in this movie it was  portrayed like that..when the Witch shifts her shape and approaches her as her lover... and gives her an apple...Why do that? Why make her kiss him then pull back?  No love relationship was built between Snow White and the Huntsman...  so I kept thinking that maybe the video skipped sessions and I ended up rewinding to make sure that I didn't miss anything...

This could have been one of the best modernized story of Snow White with a chance of becoming a classic!  Except, it became a poorly written story with tons of money wasted... I am really disappointed..Now number 2.
2.  Kristen Stewart...  yes, she could win an Oscar in Actress who sucked at acting.  After 2 hours of watching her sucky acting, the movie ends with her becoming a Queen who has nothing to say to her people...nothing none whatsoever..all she has is unidentified facial expressions...  For Pete's Sake, why didn't they make her say something so simple as "" My people today is the day of Victory and we shall all celebrate!  DJ drop the beat!""  OMG, not even a word...  This must be the time when the director of the movie finally realizes that she sucks at acting and gets pissed of with himself and punishes himself to the point where his mind goes blank and ends the movie with weird facial expressions done by Kristen Stewart...  This is the first part of what I had to say about her..  Second is, out of all those beautiful fair skinned actesses why chose Kristen as Snow White?  WHY???  She is not pretty...  WHYYYYY?  I would have loved to see Nelly Furtado play that role... or Mila Kunis, though if I had this much money I would have Adriana Lima play this role... just have to whiten her skin a tad bit... but never ever Kristen Stewart..she doesn't have the right facial features to play the role...
Third of all, when did she train herself to become a warrior?  Locked up in her room in the castle?  C'mon people can't you figure out this much that the audience need to know when and how she train herself to lead the army to war...

This movie reminds me of my early years in cooking when I had a perfect recipe in front of me, I would use different ingredients and the food I made tasted nothing like what it was supposed to taste like. If a recipe calls for sauteed onions do not replace it with sauteed garlic...  it's a different taste...I hope you all got my point...and it is my mistake buying the movie without reading the reviews....",1366502400,7,4492,4.444308445532435
4736160,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I did not see this movie in theaters. I saw it on DVD by word of mouth. Someone whose opinion I trust recommended this movie saying it was good. I watched the movie and now I own it. this is a darker take on the Snow white legend and I like darker takes on classic fairytales. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth give solid Performances. The one who surprised me the most was Kristen Stewart. I was Surprised that that not only can Kristen Stewart emote, but she can act too. I guess I should not be Surprised that Kristen Stewart can act like she has been locked in a tower for over a decade. Granted, I avoid Twilight like the plague because no one in that series can act However now I will have to rephrase that.  No one Can Act in a series like twilight. In a movie like this or others the actors are actually competent because they have roles with varying degrees of depth.

I would have liked to know a little more of his background, but I did find myself dozing off here and there, so I could have missed it.  SPOILER ALERT - there was some conflict/tension throughout the movie about the Huntsman's role and William's.  That element alone made me stay tuned, so that was good.  The dwarfs roles were marginalized.  There wasn't a distinct articulation of the personalities like in the tradition movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

4736164,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Let's face it, folks:  Charlize Theron has some serious acting chops.  And the special effects in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN are second to none.  Yet even Charlize seemed to realize she was making a film of Epic Fail Proportions, because her portrayal as the evil, immortality-seeking stepmother is as wooden and as lifeless as a used clarinet in an antique store.  And portraying Snow White, pray tell?  The enigmatic (not) Kristen Stewart, treating me to my first experience watching her ""act"", as I've avoided the countless Twilight films like the cholera morbus.  You can put Stewart's Snow White in a dungeon, or in a haunted forest where trees are chasing her (yeah, it's all nonsense), or in armour storming a castle, and she looks as bored and as impassive as if she's waiting for her nails to dry.  So she's in the clutches of her evil stepmother, on the cusp of having her soul sucked out of her?  Feh.  Let her know when it's time to go to Starbucks.

Playing the huntsman, the down-on-his-luck lad who is dispatched by the queen stepmother to go after Snow White in the haunted forest, Chris Hemsworth yacks an accent so thick you're not sure if he's mimicking Elvish Sindarin or Finnish Happy Hour; I still haven't understood a single word he's said.  And the dwarves. . .if I go there, I'll have to start drinking, and it's still morning.  In any event, if you want to see a nonsensical fantasy with a vacuous story, laughable acting, all wrapped in quality special effects in an effort to sugarcoat its shortcomings (an effort that fails), then by all means give SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN a gander.

I didn't take classes on how to write a good movie script; I have never been an actor/actress; and I do not know how to direct a movie, but I know when a movie is bad. I thought Charlize and Chris did a good job with their roles (as did the other actors).

I've seen about 20 minutes of one of the Twilight films and thought it was appalling. I can't understand why Kristen Stewart never closes her mouth. Is that some new style? Looking like a mouth-breather? Anyhow, I had very low expectations for her part. Which is maybe why I thought she was actually one of the better parts of this wretched film. I thought she did a good job as the basically uninteresting character of Snow White. I mean, it's not like there was a whole lot to work with.

I thought the biggest downfall of this film wasn't a particular actor but the incredibly PURPLE writing. My. God. Who told this person they could write dialogue? It was a cringe-worthy event from beginning to end. Especially the Queen, whose role was embarrassingly bombastic. And they the pathetic 20 second attempt to humanize her?? Hey, this is a FAIRY TALE it's okay to have a bad character who is just a bad character. If you want depth of character read some George RR Martin or some other adult book.

I gave this movie 2 stars because of its stunning cinematography. It is visually moving even with the stupid dialogue. Oh yean, and because the Huntsman is nice eye-candy.",1364774400,,1370,4.560975609756097

4736448,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Here's a big budget film with quite a few graphic combat scenes, swords slicing and flailing, horses whinnying, bodies dropping, all well done, with a host of special effects.  It's the fairy story of the evil queen, played nicely by Charlize Theron (who gets to appear in a zillion and one different costume and makeup sets), finally being undone by the rightful princess, who escapes her clutches and rallies the troops.  The production is well mounted, and money has been spent on this.  The script is serviceable, a bit awkward in terms of language in a couple of spots.  The film's main problem is it is WAY TOO LONG.  An hour or more could easily have been cut without losing any sense of story.  I realize these productions exist to employ Hollywood craftspeople, and this one is very well done, but the movie tends to drag as the princess must encounter a troll and hostile dwarfs and other such perils on her journey through the woods after she has escaped from the castle.  This part seems endless.  Still, Charlize Theron is a treat here.  I wish I could say the same for the actress who portrays the princess.

Also, a better mirror could have been picked out instead of a metal gong, so then they wouldn't have to ask how they look, they could just look in the mirror and see for themselves.",1364601600,,469,4.164835164835165

She does a little mugging in the last 30 seconds of the film, and maybe a second or two elsewhere, but for the most part, you don't see her acting, and I think she pulls this off wonderfully.

Believable acting all the way around, and I think good story telling and great cinematography.  It's supposed to be Snow White, not Shakespeare (critics are moronic sometimes), but it is the best story telling of this classic that I have seen with its unique point of view. I'm not a huge fan of action sequences -- I like good story telling -- but the live action in this movie is inventive and creative, the special effects become characterization and add a great deal not only to the characters, but to the story.  These aren't special effects just for the sake of special effects.

I enjoyed this movie and, in my opinion, it has great replay value.  I gave it 4 stars for replay value, special effects, creativity, the actors pulling off a rendition of a fairy tale without being cheesy and keeping me engaged throughout; and because it's the first movie that I have seen that isn't complete and utter garbage in so long, it was just such a relief to watch.",1364515200,3,1327,4.523012552301255

Kristen Stewart wasn't bad, but I don't think she was the right choice for the part, honestly -- she's got the looks for Snow White, but the second half of the film demanded someone with a bit more conviction as ""strong-willed revolutionary"", and Kristin just didn't deliver that convincingly: she's spent too much of her acting career pouting.

The story was great. Whoever plotted this film deserves some serious kudos. The writing, on the other hand, was a bit heavy-handed, even to the point of dipping into the cheese sometimes. Not that that's necessarily bad in a fairy tale film, but there was the potential for this to be real masterpiece, and some of the scripting just really threw that out the window.

Overall, totally enjoyable, visually stunning, good story, but some of the scripting and some of the acting brings it down from amazing. Watch it, you'll like it.",1364256000,,1288,4.797297297297297

4736645,5,B005LAIHSQ,"Charlize Theron.

So mortifiyingly fabulous.

Were there any other characters?

Ok there were other characters. But what I loved about this movie was Charlize Theron, could you tell? And the darkness of it. She was the shining star, resplendent in her evilness. Perhaps it was cinematography, or art direction, or props, or MS Theron herself. Delicious. There is a scene, with a bird, and a metal device and MS Theron. Nuff said. So tasty.

The movie itself is actually a very nice adaptation of Snow White. It is well thought, well presented, and entertaining. Art direction and cinematography (and CGI of course) is excellent. And the main actors did a fairly good job of portraying their roles. Snow White was brave, though, I would have preferred a little more character time with her to develop empathy, which was lacking. The Joan of Arc warrior type portrayal of SW is a twist, but, not one I like particularly, since it does not jibe with the original fairy tale and Germano/Celtic legends. Part of the reason I did not develop empathy is due to the short screen time with her, though SW's portrayal is also rather flat. The huntsman was also a nice touch because he is often omitted from SW films, though prominent in some of the stories. I had much stronger empathy for the huntsman. I was distracted on a couple of occasions by accents, which were inconsistent. On the one hand, if the actors had spoken in their native accents all the time, or if the actors all used some particular accent, it would not have been distracting.

On the whole though, my enjoyment factor was high, especially because of the detail in development of the darkness.

It would be nice to see perhaps 20-25 more minutes squeezed in to develop Snow White herself, and perhaps her rapport with the huntsman. Don't let this deter you from renting/buying this film though. If you like authentic and historical versions of fairy tales, the feeling of old Celtic and old Germanic fairy tales/myths is very rich in this file. Perhaps why I loved it.

Or Charlize.",1363996800,4,2044,4.740845070422536

If you've seen her acting in twilight (can't speak, face doesn't move, etc) then you've seen what she will do in this movie. There was potential based on the other cast...

4736685,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I choose to watch this movie despite the poor reviews and am glad that I did. Charlize Theron's performance as Ravenna entranced me and completely stole the movie away from Kristen Stewart's Snow White. In fact, I kept wishing that the movie had focused more on Ravenna, and her brother Finn, since they are the most interesting characters in the movie. The movie hinted at the back story of them but I felt that it could have been elaborated much more. On that note, I would actually be closer to giving the film a 3.5 since by the end I was sort of hoping that Ravenna would finish off Snow White. Stewart's performance was just dull, with her face not really showing any feeling, and this is coming from someone who has a hard time reading peoples' feelings.

So, the negatives of the film were, for me, the fact that the story focused on Snow White (who was not a compelling protagonist), didn't introduce the dwarfs until quite far in, and went with the whole ""chosen one"" explanation for why anyone should follow Snow White (just way too over used in films, as I believe another viewer mentioned). What I really liked was any scene with Ravenna in, the way the mirror was portrayed and was only seen by Ravenna, and the whole complex relationship between Ravenna and Finn. Overall I liked this movie enough to buy it, mainly because of Charlize Theron's performance, but I think that this movie is for those prepared for more action than acting...",1363651200,,1453,4.61003861003861

4736690,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Walking into this movie I was excited to see it though because it was something new. I wished that an English actress would ahve been cast as Snow White instead of Kristen Stewart who sucks at faking a British accent. If they'd just left her with her normal voice I think she'd have been a lot better off. I've never thought she was a great actress but you can tell she tried really hard in this movie. Honestly none of the actors brought their A game to me in this movie they were all just ok. You didn't get to know the characters as much as I would have liked because the movie felt a little rushed to get to the end battle between Snow White and Ravena which was short lived.

It was an interesting story because it was something different. I enjoy this movie every now and then but it's not one of my favorites. Hemsworth did well and I can see why they want to make a spin off movie based on his character and not Snow White because the producers wanted to avoid all the drama that went on between the director and Stewart's affair.

Charlize Theron? No one can deny, one of the wickedest sorceresses ever portrayed in film.  And the unexpected twists in the ending are great.  Also, a great 'adult' conversion from Disney's frolic with the animals in the woods to Princess Mononoke, and a positive theme of light and nature against the forces of darkness.

Yes, the actress Kristen Who-wart in it is awful, whining, and unconvincing, but I just ignore her like I did while my wife dragged me to see the Twilight: A New Yawn series. The dwarves are AWESOME, the scenery/cinematics are great, and Theron made an amazing witch queen (which just made Stewart's acting seem even worse).",1361923200,,442,4.986486486486487

Charlize Theron was excellent in portraying the evil queen.  Chris Hemsworth, on the other hand, was doing a second rate copy of Val Kilmer's role in Willow.  The dwarfs stole the show.

The problem is that the screenplay was just plain awful.  It allowed little or know character development, was formulaic and predictable.  It also appears to have drawn so much from Willow that at one point, I remarked, ""Where is Fin Rizel"".

I have mixed feelings about the film's direction.  On one hand, the scenes were well set up, but I can't determine if the way the actors presented their lines was the fault of the director, or the script, itself.

4737248,3,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie was pretty good, but the reason my kids wanted us to see it was for the amazing visual effects. We set up the Amazon video on demand and it started out ok, but with certain scenes it looked awful. The white hart in the fairy wood looked like a white blur, and only looked majestic for a 1-2 second close up scene. The kids talked about some of the details in the witch's costume (wow, those are actually bird bones on her dress) but we could't see them. This made a 360p Youtube video look high quality. What a waste! Now we'll have to rewatch it on disc - if we can tolerate Charleze's acting and awful accent again. Amazon you need to fix your technical problems.

4737252,5,B005LAIHSQ,"We took our 2 daughters, ages 11 and 13 to see this movie.  I'll be honest, the girls chose this movie, as it was not my first pick to see.  I expected a re-make of Snow White to a more up-dated version to be a bit challenging to watch, at the very least.

Our girls and my husband and I absolutely loved this movie!!  We could hardly wait for it to be released for purchase, and added it to our growing video library.

The special effects in this movie are nothing short of spectacular!  The make-up and body and facial changes they created for Charlise Theron were unbelievable.  She really made her character come to life, and so  believable, that everyone despised her.

The creatures in the forest were amazing to watch, both in the dark forest, and in the magical one.

Tons of action constantly, and every character was so remarkable, and had a definite purpose and place in the movie.

The movie was sad, humerous, adventurous, mysterious, romantic, magical, action packed, etc......it has it all!

I highly recommend this movie for tweens, teens, young adults, and the young at heart. It is a movie you can watch over and over, and continue to find things you missed seeing the first time you viewed it.

Everyone was talking about the movie as they left the theatre.  It is one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time!  Well worth the movie tickets, and purchase!",1361318400,,1383,4.520161290322581
4737342,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Visually exciting...and that's about it.  Story line is awkward and thin.  It does not lend itself to full, developed characters, which only makes the mostly flat acting even harder to sit through.  Chris Hemsworth (the huntsman) was the only actor that I thought was worth watching, although I had expected to like Charlize Theron as the queen.  Kristen Stewart is not remotely convincing, and certainly doesn't inspire.  All in all a dud.  I regret even paying the few dollars to rent it.",1361232000,2,490,4.914634146341464
4737343,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Let's see - who might that be? There is no denying that this visual extravaganza is entertaining - perhaps not for  the interminable 132 minutes, perhaps, but turn off the brain and turn on the special effects monitor and the movie has its merits. After making it through this SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN it is rather appalling to see that there is in production a Part II coming.  That bit of information deserves and OMG - why?

The story as adapted by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, and Hossein Amini from the Brothers Grimm sounds rather straightforward in its altered state: Snow White, imprisoned daughter of the late king, escapes just as the Magic Mirror declares her the source of the Evil Queen's immortality. The Queen sends her men, led by a local huntsman, to bring her back. But upon her capture, the huntsman finds he's being played and turns against the Queen's men, saving Snow White in the process. Meanwhile, Snow's childhood friend, William, learns that she is alive and sets off to save her.

Bad dialogue for a cast that includes Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Sam Claflin, Sam Spruell, Ian McShane , Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris and Brian Gleeson (all fairly obscured by the lack of light and gruesome makeup) just doesn't allow this treacle of a story to get off the ground.  Add to that the flat monotone Twilight girl Kirsten Stewart as the lead and the spectacular special effects become the focal star. Despite the silly lines given Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna she still manages to be the only character about whom we care - or even notice. This is a great way to spend a cooped in rainy evening when the other choices for On Demand are negligible. Stay awake for the special effects and you'll get you money's worth.

4737344,4,B005LAIHSQ,Good action.  Ok storyline.  Entertaining. Can see similarities to other movies of the genre; Lord of the Rings trilogy; Joan of Arc.,1361232000,,133,5.0
4737345,1,B005LAIHSQ,"Ultra disappointing ""Extended Cut"" to the equaling disappointing film. A whopping 4 Minutes of footage are added to the blu ray, and what is there isn't much. A few scenes of the Queen ordering her men to kill the remaining soldiers of the army; Snow White being showed a deer carcass by the Huntsman; The Prince telling the Huntsman how much he cares about Snow White; the Queen's brother, Finn asking men who have been to The Dark Forest.
  I was hoping that this edition would show the scenes that were featured in the Trailer, scenes such as Snow White encountering the Troll for a second time; the Queen Screaming as the Mirror shatters; the Queen appearing young in the snow-covered forest just as she turns into ravens; Snow White standing alone on a cliff with the castle before her; the Queen walking into her bath from a different angle; the Huntsman's additional fight scenes using two axes in the forest. None of this is added into the Extended Cut--this footage isn't even listed in a Deleted Scenes Bonus. I was hoping there would be improvements from The Theatrical Version, but the changes are so suttle, one barely even notices them. Even in the Florence & The Machine video of ""Breath of Life"" we get to see new footage of the Queen swimming around in her milk bath.
  The film looks great on blu ray, with excellent picture and rich colors. Too bad the movie wasn't as good! The Trailer made this film look awesome; and there are some things that work, such as Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna and the costumes. Other than that, the movie is disjointed, boring, and anti-climactic. Ambitious, but not nearly as good as it could have been, had they been given a better director.",1361232000,2,1696,4.6433333333333335

4737348,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie has so many things going for it.  Do yourself a favor and watch the entire movie before you judge.  Charlize Teron opens up a serious can of whoop ass on Snow White before by fairest blood, the queen is undone.  Some of the best acting is this movie is done by the actors under 5 feet tall.  The costumes are beautiful, the sets are wonderful and the locations were stunning.  The special effects where imaginative and do not fail to work on the small screen.  That being said, If you can ignore the Huntsman you will enjoy this movie.

The only thing worse than Hensworth's performance as ""Thor"" Is the hammer like manner in which he wields this HORRID accent.  The ""Huntsman's"" accent comes and goes throughout the entire film.  Hensworth makes it almost impossible to get through the first half of this otherwise wonderful feature.  His accent is as though he showed up drunk for the entire production.  It is just awful and will take determination to get past.  Hensworth proves you don't need skill just Hollywood looks to get paid.

It is too bad though, without Hensworth this had epic written all over it.  All in all, I still like this film and will purchase it.",1361145600,,1182,4.566666666666666

My 13yr and 11yr old and I sat to look at this, and they were more disappointed than I was. The typical ""good vs evil"" can be show without it being so dark. We came away wondering what the message really was in all that. The special effects and good acting, which we would normally appreciate, paled into the background. Very disappointing. Too many shows now have too much ""dark side"" to them. What ever happened to movies that left you feeling edified and entertained?",1361059200,,582,4.5

Enjoyed Stewart's efforts. Felt like they had Theron trying too hard at being evil. And due to the difficult flow, my subconscious kept kicking in former character casting: so it was good thing that Bella had Thor, Phillip and Smee along to help her.

Dusted with just the correct amount of Romance this dark cake tastes just right. Kudos to the filmakers for not making the Evil Queen, (God I love that girl from South Africa), a caricature. An oblique mention of possible abuse of the Evil Queen as a younger women is interesting without being gratuitous.",1360368000,,453,4.973684210526316

The start of the movie is great, doesn't drag, takes you into the movie and really tells you the background of the story. The only thing I didn't like was the storyline between the huntsman and Snow White. It sort of leaves it to interpretation, their relationship or how they feel about one another.  The ending is another part that I didn't like.  No, dialog, took to long...kinda dragged.

4737696,1,B005LAIHSQ,"Yes the special effects in this movie are stunning, no argument there.  However the basic cinematography and production design were sorely lacking.  The poorly-chosen camera angles failed to engage the viewer.  The drab sets and color-filtering made everything blend together into murky grey soup where nothing pops off the screen.  Instead of creating a visually stimulating look, we are left with nothing worth looking at.

Somehow Charlize Theron manages to capture the attention.  Her bearing, gestures, and timing are of the sublime quality we have become used to in her work.  Without ever going over the top, she does create a presence.  Her delivery of the script is the best that can be expected of an actor working with a script of such soporific banality.

Kristen Stewart should just hang her hat on the ""Twilight"" series and call it a day. This is the type of performance that the term ""dialed it in"" was made for. Her performance was a flat and lacked any sort of affect. There was nothing in her eyes and face to suggest the presence of a character.  Her delivery rose to the level of the pedestrian script and went no further.  There was nothing in her mannerisms or physicallity that generated interests.

The cast as a whole seems to be very talented and committed to delivering a quality performance.  However their efforts are wasted on a poor script set in an ill-conceived setting.

There has been much excitement in reworking the classic fables into something closer to the originals.  This particular movie could kill that kind of interest fast.  This movie does not have enough substance to be considered a change from Disney.  Truth is this movie has nothing worth considering at all.",1360195200,6,1710,4.881944444444445

At first, I could not imagine Kristen Stewart as Snow White. She never struck me as all that beautiful and there is a moroseness about her.  However, given the dark nature of the film, her general film persona actually worked in her favor in this particular role.  On the other hand, Charlize Theron blew me away with her performance as the evil Queen Ravenna.  There is a love triangle in the film, and I like the fact that it was not neatly resolved at the end.  Yes, it leaves room for a sequel, but I also felt it was a satisfying, appropriate ending to the film.

I don't want to be redundant about what's wrong with this mess of a film, but I will say that the attempt to retell  an old story was ridiculously pretentious and so far off the mark that I couldn't finish watching.

4737915,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Charlize Theron can both act even in a fantasy farce and be so stunningly  beautiful, what a combo!!!  The presentation of the dwarves totally defeat the appearance of the unconvincing dwarves in Lord of the Rings.  Charlize and the Dwarves alone are worth watching, actually they are the only things worth watching in this film and make it okay rather than bad.",1359849600,,362,4.806451612903226
4737916,5,B005LAIHSQ,"There are three or four Snow White movies making the rounds right now.  Having seen all of them, this is by far the darkest.  Charlize Theron plays Ravenna (the ""Queen"") exceedingly well as a man hating, husband eating villain.  Chris Hemsworth almost overshadows Snow White as the huntsman.  This is definitely not a ""children's rendition"" of this timeless classic.",1359849600,,366,5.1525423728813555

4738029,2,B005LAIHSQ,"This film looks great visually, but is too uneven. I found myself stating over and over...""Now-who is this...again?""  In my opinion there are some ridiculous scenes that come out of no-where. POSSIBLE SPOILER- BUT I DON'T THINK SO: I WILL JUST MENTION A SCENE OR TWO--The most preposterous being when snow white is trying to escape and ends up on the beach where there just happens to be a gorgeous healthy white horse sitting by the water. Of course she rides it full tilt to escape the posse. Snow herself most of the time is in full make up with long fake eyelashes (a close up in the forest reveals the eye lashes) This is after 10 years in prison and weeks in the dark forest and trudging through city sewers.
Although the direction and flow was poor, the acting was very good from the cast. At times a tad over-acting from Snow white with her riling up the troops speech and the queen, who I thought would collapse from stress and anger in her dialogue; but all in all pretty good.

Not to give any more of the movie away, there are several other inconsistencies in the film from beginning to end. I was not impressed. It is also overly long and clocks in at over two hours. This would have been a fun ""after school special"" like you would watch in the old days of TV. A teleplay with some nice visuals and decent acting...but nothing that you would want to see again and should have been about 60 minutes long. (with commercials)  I would suggest a rent only. We streamed it on Amazon for the cost of a large Mocha Frappachino (sp). I regret not getting the Frap instead. I would have saved 2+ hours.  It gets 2 stars for the visuals, which are very nice.

The rest of the film: sticks tongue out and blows to make sound.",1359849600,,1728,4.354037267080745

4738038,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Cherlize Theron is brilliant as a villain in this epic-wanna-be movie twist on the Snow White story.  Chris Hemsworth (Thor) also holds his own, but K. Stew's bad acting made the movie less enjoyable.  I'm sure all of the Twilight fans may reject my review as result of my view, but she just did not fit the role well besides her attractiveness.  The action and special effects were good.  The storyline was interesting but a bit prolonged and boring at parts.  However, I'd definitely recommend renting Huntsman for its entertainment value and to see Cherlize, but don't expect a Lord of the Rings epic feel.",1359590400,,609,4.761904761904762
4738182,3,B005LAIHSQ,"In this dark re-telling of the classic fairy tale, Snow White escapes the grasps of the evil Queen Ravenna after her father's kingdom is thwarted, and it will be up to the young Princess who is pure of heart to amass the forces of good against her wicked stepmother. Or so it would seem... It is difficult to tell exactly what is going on throughout the threadbare plot in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN. Sure, it looks pretty, but the big-budget special effects cannot hide the fact that SNOW WHITE makes very few attempts at telling a compelling story. Kristen Stewart stars as our slack-jawed and angst-ridden heroine (if you can call her that). Snow White spends the majority of the film fleeing through the woods with the aid of The Hunstman (Chris Hemsworth), before suddenly and confusingly becoming the leader of a major rebellion against The Queen. The term 'contrived' receives a whole new meaning in the film's brisk 2-hour run time. Charlize Theron is given a few moments to shine as Ravenna, but if any praise is due at all, it must be given to the set designers, who have brilliantly dressed everything from the brooding castles to the enchanted forests. SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN provides enough eye-candy to 'wow' most fantasy fans, but THE LORD OF THE RINGS this is not.

This was recommended to me by another adult and I thought, ""Why not? Perhaps it's a clever adaptation of the fairy tale."" HAHAHAHAHA I will be honest and say I stopped the movie when Snow White was escaping from the tower.

The beginning scene is lovely. The snow falling. The rose. The queen pricking her finger. That's the high point. How much stupid computer-generated animation, how much melting objects with deep voices, how many stupid battle scenes are the American public going to keep swallowing before they've had enough and stop going to see drivel like this?

4738284,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Mommies and Daddies and other audience members who are expecting a traditional interpretation of the fairy tale of Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs, look out!  This movie is NOT for young children; although there is no real nudity and little profanity, there is a lot of violence, some of it pretty scary.  The story focuses on the antipathy between the heroine, princess Snow White, and her new stepmother/evil queen Ravenna, played by Charlize Theron (who, frankly, steals the show with her evil posturings and amazing wardrobe!).  It turns out that after the evil queen murdered her father, Snow White (played by Kristin Stewart, who does a significantly better job of acting than she did in some of her other films) had been imprisoned in her castle until adulthood, when she escapes and  flees into the Dark Forest (this part is scary for young children).  An enraged Queen Ravenna hires a wastrel huntsman to recapture the lost beauty so that she can steal her (literal!) heart and use it to become immortal and beautiful forever.  The main plot for the rest of the movie then deals with Snow White's efforts to defeat the evil queen, eventually aided by the huntsman and childhood sweetheart Prince William (Charming?) and a ragtag group of not-your-Disneyland dwarves!  The scenery and fx are excellent, the plot is well done, and the acting is adequate to good; however, the interpretation of this classic fairy tale is somewhat akin to that of the TV series Once Upon A Time, which perhaps does it better.  A likeable movie, however, and I am pleased to have it on my DVD shelves.

I went into this hoping to see her finally do something different for once, but it just doesn't happen.  Not that all Snow Whites have to be sweet and innocent and Disney-esque, but she provides absolutely no reason to cheer for her character.  It got to the point where I was hoping a huge new twist would happen and that the Evil Queen would triumph in the end!",1359417600,,664,4.454545454545454

Kristen Stewart barely says two words and theres this whole scene with a stag in the forest that speaks to Snow White's purity and how she's going to bring about the downfall of the evil queen.  Its just stupid.

This movie must have been interrupted about 15 or 20 times to buffer, usually lasting from 5 to 30 seconds. I cannot believe that I paid good money to be constantly interrupted and annoyed. My wife and I were so exhausted of watching it that by the end we were laughing about the whole thing. I was actually considering purchasing Amazon Prime since I use Amazon for other purchases, but, after this, I wonder who actually pays for this garbage. It might work for someone out there, but I've heard a lot of problems with Amazon's Instant Video streaming service due to buffering issues. I'll just stick to Netflix.

 Snow White and the Huntsman (2012)
 Universal Pictures
  PG-13

Directed by: Rupert Sanders

Starring: Charlize Theron, Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth, Sam Claflin

Snow White and the Huntsman is a Hollywood film based on the fantastic stories written by the Brothers Grimm. In my estimation it is the third film that could be attributed to those wonderful stories, although in fairness the movie the Brothers Grimm was more of a Hollywood version of the brothers themselves.

Kristen Stewart plays our Snow White in this telling, with Charlize Theron holding court as Queen Ravenna. We are introduced to Snow White first as the young daughter of King Magnus and Queen Eleanor, she is show to be the Fairest of them All, with a pure and loving heart. Through an illness Queen Eleanor passes on and the King is left heartbroken. In his grief he is lured into battle outside the castle walls where he meets and is immediately love-struck with Ravenna, so much so that within days he marries her. At first she seems to take a genuine liking to our young Snow White, it quickly sours however as we see the new Queen's true motivations. It is shown that at a young age one thing was instilled in Ravenna, something that seems to hold true in our current day, Beauty and Youth command true power and sway over all else in society. Ravenna wants to be young and beautiful forever and unfortunately for Snow White, she is the one that can save or destroy the Queen. She firstly calls upon the Huntsman (Hemsworth), a brokenhearted man himself having lost his wife when the Queen first took the throne. He agrees to help on the condition the Queen resurrects his wife. The Huntsman leads them into the Dark Forest, not knowing who he is hunting, and it is there after he has found Snow White that he is made to realize he was used and he would indeed see his wife again but not as he had intended. The Queen, now furious after having not succeeded so easily sends her brother out to hunt the girl and bring her back and kill the Huntsman. William (Claflin), a childhood friend of Snow White who has long lamented the fact that he left her behind so many years ago, joins the hunt, feeling it to be an easy way to find and save her. Chased into the forest of the fairies we meet the dwarves, so familiar and yet not one of them bare the names we come to expect. From here we get some of the traditional pieces we remember, an apple, sweet sorrow and a kiss, but how they play out.. well, I won't spoil that for you. In the end we get a solid battle and an outcome that leaves you both satisfied and ready for more.

I really wasn't sure what I was going to feel from this movie. I will simply say, I loved it. basing itself more off of the original darker tales from the Brothers Grimm, these are fairy tales I am more than willing to get behind and recommend. The visuals are simply stunning the filtering they used makes it feel like it is a dark and brooding Winter. The music elicits the emotions when needed and is non existent as well. Many of the story changes in this film, make infinitely more sense to me and I feel add more depth to the story, things such as who gives Snow White the apple, why is Ravenna so hellbent on achieving long lasting Beauty and Youth. These things actually make sense in this film, and Kristen Stewart does a fantastic job as Snow White, I am of the mind that her acting skills are vastly underrated by many who just toss her aside based on their dislike of her Twilight films (which are good, if you just go in with an open mind). Charlize Theron however is the true star in this film. As always, she gives her all and absolutely owns her role as Queen Ravenna and basically the movie itself, she is simply amazing here and it shouldn't be missed.

The Film clocks in at just about above Two Hours, and like many movies it does have its ups and downs, and probably could have saved about Twelve to Fifteen minutes, but all in all this was as fun and entertaining movie I have seen, and would highly recommend it to any and all.

Final Verdict: 4/5 ( See It)",1358553600,,4175,4.406493506493507
4738791,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Okay, so I really wanted to like this movie. But I have to confess, I do not like Kristen Stewart as an actor. She is as flat, annoying and one dimensional in this as she was in Twilight. I guess I was just hopeful that she'd be better. Maybe I was counting on the supporting cast to inspire her to greater emotion and acting ability. Is it wrong that I rooted for the queen? If you want a decent Snow White movie, try Mirror Mirror instead.",1358553600,,441,4.1395348837209305

4738800,4,B005LAIHSQ,"My experience with the story of Snow White had been limited to the old Disney feature length cartoon, and taking pictures of the Snow White character with my granddaughter at Disneyland.  I was lukewarm about purchasing this movie when my wife decided that it would be fun to see.  (translation, she likes Chris Hemsworth).  Well, I have given this movie Four Stars because I really did enjoy it!  Although I could have come up with someone who was actually ""fairer"" than Charlize Theron, I thought Kristen Stewart did a pretty good job as Snow White.  Both the story and the action kept my attention throughout, and I can recommend this movie as a good use of your entertainment time.

4738867,3,B005LAIHSQ,I liked this much darker version of Snow White.  I must say it had me thinking about the story at the end.  I was hesitant to view this one after reading a ton of reviews about how bad the acting was.  I didn't think it was bad.  The special effects were good and it was an ok movie to view.  Not blockbuster but worth watching when you have the time.,1358294400,,351,3.9571428571428573
4738868,4,B005LAIHSQ,The is a dramatic remake of the Snow White story with elements for every viewer.  It was a good mix of action/adventure.,1358294400,,120,4.454545454545454

4738870,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I think I read somewhere that ""Snow White"", not just this one- Disney too, is based on an old fairy tale. I have no idea (Disney is all I know) but I can see vague similarities between this version and Disney, they're about as much alike as most book/movie adaptations.
Don't show this one to small children- it's more violent with lots of sword fighting, arrow shooting and just a little blood. 9 drops of blood, 2 bloody mouths, 1 bloody forehead, 3 stabbings (1 of those bloodless) by my count. I found the first half to be slower  than the second with only a couple of battles but at least they looked impressive as did the big battle late in the movie.
Some reviewers bash Kristen Stewart on just about every detail, I'd give her about as much credit here as I'd give Chris Hemsworth and he did pretty well most of the time. If I were to complain about anything I noticed while watching the extended version that when Snow White drops the poisoned apple if you watch closely she drops it twice!, needed a little bit better editing there.
I've only watched the DVD, not the Blu ray, but the picture quality is great, depressing light/color for the more depressing parts of the story- the extended version is 4 minutes longer than the theatrical version, I'm not sure what got added. It appears to me that there are enough loose ends to the movie to make up a sequel just to resolve them, hasn't there been some talk of that?
I like the movie, I'm just not sure that I'll watch it many times.",1358208000,,1495,4.397111913357401
4738921,5,B005LAIHSQ,Bought this as a Christmas gift and the recipient has watched it several times and is very happy. For anyone who likes this movie it makes a great gift.,1358208000,,152,4.275862068965517

4738924,5,B005LAIHSQ,"Maybe I'm a sucker, but I really enjoyed this movie.

4739115,1,B005LAIHSQ,"**contains spoilers**
Many reviewers have mentioned Kristin Stewart's emotionless acting as a reason for rating this movie poorly. While I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment of Stewart's ""insert main character here"" moments on screen, I venture farther than that to say that the ultimate flaw in this film is the script.  While the plot is innovative and moves rapidly, the dialogue leaves much to be desired. Lines are often mumbled or seem out of place, breaking the scene's flow. For example, when Stewart says in the final scene to the queen ""you cannot have my heart"" it makes you wonder whether Snow is a little dim witted. Considering that Snow has just raised an army, brawled her way through the castle, and stabbed the queen, it is obvious that the Queen cannot have Snow's heart to claim victory for the bad guys. She is also unlikely to convince Snow to order her a pizza or fold her laundry, yet the script writers thankfully left those pieces of redundancy on the editing room floor. I found myself laughing through most of this movie a la Mystery Science Theater 3000. As the credits rolled, I felt as through I had just sat through a high school play, complete with unnecessary angst, awkward timing, and overacted mediocre lines. I do not recommend this film unless you are looking for something to laugh at with friends and mass quantities of alcohol.",1357862400,9,1376,4.805907172995781

4739118,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Okay, no doubt people will have their own opinions as to whether the acting is quality from the stars in this film. You get a great performance from Charlize Theron, as the queen Revena she is wicked and vane, and all the other qualities you would expect. Oscar worthy? Meh, maybe not, but for the genre she does hit is out of the park (or poisoned forest if you prefer). Chris Hemsworth plays the part he's dealt and at the level that he can act... And of course our special case of Kristen Stewart gets the rasberry nod for her performance... I liked the parts where the director clearly told her to stand there, look pretty, and keep your mouth shut... Okay the acting was what it was, the story was what it was...

The visuals and overall impact of the movie is solid. It has action, it has drama, it has humor, it has evil, and it has good conquering all at the right time. The audio track is rich and the foley artists clearly rock this movie! On my best day this movie cannot earn that ellusive 5 stars, but it was a fun to watch film with great effects and overall impact. And, if you like the new release of the classic fairy-tale stories with the darker twists, this should be one to add to the list and your collection.",1357776000,,1230,4.278969957081545
4739119,4,B005LAIHSQ,"The unexpected greeted me when I viewed this film.  The story of my childhood was not what I found.  Instead this is a story of evil at its opportunistic best and the real challenge and danger of overcoming it.  The stars were dazzling; the supporting cast superberb (especially since I recognized most of them from a long distinguished history of acting); the settings and photography were amazing!!!  I cringed at the witch and her ways (Charlize Theron was a very different beauty in this), gained a very different take on ""the mirror on the wall,"" and wished for a while that I could have visited the sanctuary to see the unusual animals and the Head Spirit.  This is not the film you watch once then leave on the shelf.  This is the film that you add to your film library (the ones you really watch over and over again).  Don't bypass this!

Given the choice, Charlize Theron was a much more attractive option than the wooden, emotionless ""Snow White"" who couldn't persuade me to like her in the least.  Visually, it was an incredible movie.  Unfortunately, Kristen Stewart was frequently out-acted by the scenery and made the experience simply brutal. Too many long shots of her emotionless face could have trimmed the movie to about 45 minutes.",1357257600,,463,5.065789473684211

After years of captivity she somehow knows how to ride a horse bareback, at breakneck speed,  without falling off.

The trailers made it look exciting, but also darker than it turned out to be. Not that it isn't dark -- it is, but it's fantasy with plenty of action and humor while still carrying pretty dark tone. Acting, sets and CGI are all outstanding and seamless, and I never felt like I was watching CGI. And Kirsten Stewart? Well, the best endorsement I can give is that it's such a great movie in spite of that choice as Snow White. Yes they could have done better but I have to admit she managed it well, and the moveie's other plusses more than made up for any slight negative I would give it on that score.",1357171200,,835,4.291139240506329

Kristen Stewart wasn't all that bad in this. Not a lot of dialog from her, which I appreciate. She still doesn't seem to want to close her mouth very much. She still has that same blank expression on her face all the time. So she doesn't really speak and it's not Twilight so it's got my vote!",1357084800,,656,4.615384615384615

4739851,3,B005LAIHSQ,"This is one of those movies that had I paid for it in a theater, I would have been fairly mad.  As it stands, I'm mildly irritated.

The plot was interesting and a dark take on the original story of Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs.  However, there were times that what was going on was confusing.  For one, the canned British accents from the American actors tended to be confusing, and then the thick accents from other actors made understanding the story line even more confusing as to what was going on.

Charlize Theron was wonderful as Queen Ravenna.  However, the whole thing with her brother was just.... weird.  Really weird. If he was supposed to be sharing her ability to remain ageless, his spell needed some tweaking, and that whole caressing and attending her while she was fairly naked thing was borderline incestuous.

Plus, God help her... while I love the Twilight movies in a perverse way, Kristen Stewart has almost zero range as far as showing emotions in a movie.  It was hard to tell when she was happy, sad, angry, elated, frightened, or just there... like a rock.  I swear she and Keanu Reeves should do a movie together and call it Apathy The Movie.  Plus, what happened with the ending?  Yes, she was crowned Queen, but what happens with the romance after that?

The visual effects were stunning and interesting.  The scenery was beautiful, but as far as everything else.... this movie left me scratching my head and wondering what all the hype was about.",1357084800,,1477,4.630769230769231
4739852,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Terrible movie, terrible directing, Kristen Stewart is like the new Kevin Costner, sometimes british sometimes not. It kills my suspension of disbelief that she could ever be fairer than Charlize, (who I expected to be awesome but was just eh?) Chris Helm is decent eye candy but there is very little build to romance or actual romance. Fail Fail Fail.",1356998400,,352,4.883333333333334
4739853,2,B005LAIHSQ,"There are no likeable characters in this flick. Even Thor and Charlize Theron couldn't get me to rally behind this flick. I understand they were going for a darker version of the fairy tale, but the movie could have used a few lighter moments to get us to like the protagonists. As they have it, there is zero chemistry between the Hemsworth's huntsman and Stewart's Snow White. The lack of romantic spark between the two leads becomes even more painful to watch when the movie tries to get us to buy in to the spell breaking ""surprise"" of having the huntsman's kiss being the one that actually breaks the curse and not that of Prince Charming.

While I admit to being predisposed to being annoyed by Kristen Stewart's acting, courtesy of the Twilight series, her performance in this movie does nothing to dispel her reputation for being a one note actress.  She really lays on her moody, constipated performance thick in this flick as well. Seriously, I didn't get why we were supposed to believe that her Snow White was anything special. She is that wooden.  And what were the casting guys thinking when they cast an evil queen that is ten times hotter than Snow White????!!! It was truly distracting. I wanted to yell at the queen that her mirror was a FREAKING LIAR!!!!

I give it two stars for the good camera work and look of the movie, but the rest is just soulless.

Who the heck are these people giving this 4 and 5 stars anyway?  I just don't see it!",1356998400,2,1460,4.511363636363637

4739855,5,B005LAIHSQ,This is the best Snow White tale out this year.  Forget seeing the others. I begrudgingly even liked Kristen Stewart.  Charlize Theron was awesome as the stepmother Queen.  Don't miss this one.  Probably too intense for grade schoolers.,1356998400,,236,5.131578947368421

4739857,5,B005LAIHSQ,"I like how this movie balances so many things well, and doesn't overdo anything. The movie begins slightly happy, moves into deep darkness, then into light when they take refuge in the forest, and the only thing that could improved the ending would be for Snow White to thank the families of those who'd died in the fight for their sacrifices. I like how the movie has common people who get nasty because of the dark times, but also common people like the women at the lake who seem to be maintaining a community with honour. I especially like how the movie doesn't gratuitously demonize any real-world beliefs - It seamlessly blends Christian and pagan beliefs. The movie also makes a good attempt at showing how the root of evil often lies with a warped or naive sense of justice when the Queen remembers back to the raid during her childhood and asks her brother whether she treats the people of the kingdom better than she and her brother were treated when they were young. The movie similarly creates a degree of empathy with the troll.

Also, the movie doesn't create a strained plot whereby the romantic tension completely resolves by the end - It's great to see Snow White and the Huntsman look at each other from across the hall at the end, with the audience wondering both whether they're going to get together, and even whether Snow White knows that he brought her out of death with his kiss. And then there's the childhood boyfriend the Queen's avatar of whom Snow White kissed complicating her relationship with the Huntsman.

This is the sort of movie that creates unanswered questions in exactly the right way, and nicely balances a lot of themes. The only thing it could have done better was develop Snow White's leadership abilities. In my view, the script-writer(s) did a great job.",1356998400,,1800,4.693037974683544

Huntsman can't do the deed, they hook up with seven dwarfs (sorry, ""little people""), and then Snow White goes all Terminator and gathers an army together to take back her kingdom and stop the evil queen's dark tyranny over the entire land.

4740304,4,B005LAIHSQ,A trifle longer than it needed to be but still enjoyable.  Of course I wanted the huntsman to get the girl but nooooo........,1356739200,2,125,4.434782608695652
4740305,3,B005LAIHSQ,The only thing I liked about this movie besides all the special effects was Charlene Thezon's character of the queen. She played the part so well of being so evil to the core. She is by far an exceptional actress.,1356652800,,213,4.35

Not what you would normally imagine in a remake where they simply replace older actors and actresses with the more new version",1356652800,,144,5.041666666666667
4740359,3,B005LAIHSQ,"With boost in writing, better Snow casting, and more of a twist on the classic tale, this would have been a great movie. Charlize Theron is worth seeing though.",1356652800,,160,4.551724137931035

4740366,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Finally gotten around to seeing this film. Was somewhat hesitant given all the bad reviews I'd heard. Snow White's story has been told and retold probably a hundred ways. This is a slightly different retelling all-around. I liked the new approach. To be honest, I've always found Snow White's basic story to be kind of boring. Great cast that keep the long movie evenly paced, great visual affects, and a fun and suspenseful angle. I thought Charlize was great as the villian, and thought Chris and Kristen were good also. Kristen appears to have a lot of haters or people who simply don't like her acting. I thought she was good here, although I didn't think the s/l asked that much of her from an emotional level. Prince Charming, or whoever the other guy was supposed to me, went missing for much of the way, paving the way for the Huntsmen. And it is the Huntsmen who does most of the heavy lifting here. Was expecting some kind of triangle, that thankfully never happened. This is Snow White's story though, and it was nice to see her go head-to-head with the Evil Witch. Found myself unsuspectingly rooting for her when the big battle finally arrived. Seemed too short, but I still enjoyed it. This film downplayed the usual romantic angle of Snow White, which I think worked for it. I wasn't really expecting to like this as much as I did. It's a definite buy for me after just renting it.",1356566400,,1396,4.565737051792829

4740428,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I thought the movie was just ok, I was more disappointed with the ending than anything else in the movie.  It was a little too long without enough ""actual"" story line and the ""forest"" reminded me of Princess Bride which in my estimation was a MUCH better movie.  But that's another story.  I was thinking about buying this for my collection but will bypass it completely.",1356566400,,371,4.590909090909091

4740488,3,B005LAIHSQ,Kristen Stewart has a hard time playing an innocent pure hearted girl like you would expect Snow White to be.  She is better as the dark and innocent girl she plays in Twilight.  Other than that the movie was great.  I just felt that Kristen didn't pull the part off well.,1356566400,,272,4.294117647058823

Surprisingly, I enjoyed her acting in this. This is a more darker, more action packed update of the classic fairy tale. I really liked the cast and the fantasy sequences throughout. It's not a memorable movie by any means, but the plot and suspense stacks up well. Four stars ****",1356480000,,441,4.45679012345679

The villain carries out continued destruction of others lives in order to perpetuate her own. We need someone really bad to hate, so when goodness triumphs, we feel a deep sense of gratification - and now satisfied, we can move on with a calm sense that right will ultimately win out in every situation no matter how dark and desolate things may become.",1356480000,2,632,4.651785714285714

I guess the real, actual, award winning story, the story known and loved by millions of people, the story with such positive messages - that story wasn't good enough for Kristen Stewart.

4740758,5,B005LAIHSQ,"Note: I saw the theatrical cut a few months ago with XFinity On Demand and I saw the Extended Cut a few hours ago.

Snow White And The Huntsman is a unique take on the popular fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Kristen Stewart does an incredible job as Snow White, Academy Award winner Charlize Theron really excels as the Evil Queen and Chris Hemsworth is terrific as The Huntsman. He reminds me of Brad Pitt, only with an Australian accent. Sam Claflin is somewhat underused here, but it's okay. The story draws you in from the opening music and doesn't let go until the final credits fade. Once again, James Newton-Howard creates a rousing, stirring and heart-rending score. See this film, and if this version isn't your particular cup of tea, stick with Walt Disney Pictures' Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs & the smash hit ABC series Once Upon A Time.

Now for my review of the Extended Cut of the movie.

I don't have much to add to my review of the Extended Cut, other than what I said about the Theatrical Cut still stands, and the following. The Extended Cut of Snow White And The Huntsman is even better than the Theatrical Cut, in that it includes four minutes of footage not seen in theatres, and the scenes add a bit more to the story rather than slow it down. The film could have been much longer, like 2/1/2 to 3 hours, with more plot development, but the length of both versions is okay. I recommend the Extended Cut of the movie.

Biblically speaking, there isn't much to be concerned about, content-wise. As is usual with any film about Snow White, there is magic involved, and it's use here is more realistic and therefore could be frightening for younger viewers. There's one improper use of Hell and one use of P-ss, but aside from that, no additional cursing and absolutely no swearing (Damned is used a few times, but in an appropriate context). The violence is a little more realistic than usually portrayed in a film about Snow White, but there is barely any blood shown (save for a few scenes). There is one scene in both versions where the Evil Queen disrobes and dips into a milk bath; however, no nudity is shown thanks to the discreet camera angle when she drops her robe and her hands are over her breasts when she's shown from the front. It's very brief, though.

There IS one film about Snow White that I would absolutely caution you about viewing, as I don't know if it's reviewed on this site. The film is Snow White: A Tale Of Terror. I do NOT recommend that version of the story due to the dark & heavy violence, frightening images and a satanic ritual that takes place near the end.",1356393600,,2619,4.47071129707113

It is an experience to be had and for me, quite a surprise.  I don't know what I was expecting.  I had been no real fan of Kristen Stewart, but her acting work in Snow White is very good.  I think I probably watched it because of Charlize Theron, who I've always enjoyed watching.  But whatever the reason, I am glad I did.  Any time a director can take such a well-known tale and turn it on it's head and make it into something so completely unique and imaginative certainly deserves a lot of respect, at least from me.",1356393600,,685,4.183206106870229

4740949,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I am not upset by any means that I rented this movie for $1.99.  The special effects alone were worth that.  The movie at times had me on the edge of my seat, but it didn't take me long to realize that it was all from the action and not from the actual substance (I found myself making fun of the movie about half way through).

The acting, well, not sure I really saw much.  The script was very thin to say the least.  Any character development was sacrificed in the name of action....which is probably good, because if Kristen Stewart were to develop into anything more, it could only go downhill!!  I avoided Twilight as most reviewers did, but WOW...she is terrible!!  Barely believable as a living breathing human being, Stewart is playing Snow White aka ""the fairest of them all""...ummm, I can't be the only one to find her decidedly unattractive!!?

If the trailer interested you as it did me, you probably will at least not regret the movie.  Just know going in, that the movie itself is pretty much 2 hours of the trailer.  But, if you are looking for a fresh take on the Snow White story and want to walk away thinking WOW....then don't waste your time!!

4741128,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Being a Kristen Stewart fan was mainly what drove my powerful interest in this film. She is the only reason I enjoy the Twilight films and I figured there would be a similar effect in Snow White. Having seen it three times now, I can definitely say that she is not the only draw, and is also not the only enjoyable thing about the film. Snow White & the Huntsman sets out to be this sweeping, big-budget action/fantasy epic with a grandiose story (and soundtrack). It only partially succeeds, but what's there is still (to me) an enjoyable experience.

The main problem the film suffers from is a lack of consistent pacing and tone. There are many important scenes which drive the emotional bond between characters, whether it's between Snow White, the dwarves, Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman, or a combination of the three. These scenes are done well, but the transitions between them and the action sequences in the film are often messy. We are often jolted from action to emotion in weird and awkward ways at times, and it disrupts the natural flow. Still, the final product is worthwhile and still succeeds (through fantastic performances from its stars, most notably Charlize Theron) even as it suffers from weak transitions and pacing.

The audio quality and picture quality are fantastic, and the set comes with a number of interesting extras that really delve into the production and costume design for the film, as well as the thought process behind bringing a darker, grittier version of the Snow White fairytale to the screen.

As it stands, Snow White and the Huntsman is a missed opportunity for what could have been a genuine summer blockbuster. However it is still worth a watch and the blu-ray boasts excellent audio and picture quality, as well as a healthy dose of extras. Recommended.",1356134400,,1799,4.85342019543974

4741131,4,B005LAIHSQ,"The good about this movie?  Charlize Theron.  She rocked, chewed and gnawed on every scene with great veracity.  She was an awesome mean villain!  The dark cinematography is beautiful and imaginative.  The Huntsman is brooding and rugged switching sides from the Wicked Queen and siding with Snow White.  Kristen Stewart was lacking in depth in this and totally miscast.  Her monologue to the soldiers was painful and showed that she is not a natural actor, but one that was trained.

The CGI is incredible, the fight scenes were really well done and the villain is a grade A badass.

Like I mentioned above alot of the negative reviews seem to be focused on Kristen, who I thought did a great job as Snow White. I think the whole cheating scandal was still fresh and everyone was just hating on her, and thanks to that this movie kind of got a bad rep right from the get go, but let me tell you, this is a awesome movie and it is definitely worth checking out!",1355961600,2,756,4.178082191780822

4741592,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White is one of the oldest fairy tales ever written. Also the one most recently turned into a feature film. Less than three months ago, in fact. Is this Universal Pictures offering better or just some carbon copy?

  Snow White (played as a young woman by Raffey Cassidy) is the child of a benevolent king and a woman who died as a result of complications arising from childbirth. Despite her tragedy, however, she has a happy childhood. Then her father takes up arms against a dark army. The soldiers in that army, while capable of striking blows as fierce as any and fiercer than some, breaks like glass when struck by the enemy. With the dark army vanquished, the king inspects a carriage that survived the battle and finds a woman inside. The woman, Ravenna (played by Charlize Theron), soon marries the king who fell in love with her at first sight. She appears to have genuine affection for the king and Snow in the short period leading up to the wedding, but that is, of course, a ruse. On their wedding night, she murders her husband while her brother Finn (played by Sam Spruell) overruns the kingdom with the help of that same dark army that the king believed had kidnapped Ravenna. Snow attempts to flee, but is captured and imprisoned in the palace tower. Years pass and Ravenna maintains her beauty and youth by draining the life from young women whose beauty might one day surpass her own. Those women are identified by the queen's mirror and chief advisor (voiced by Christopher Obi Ogugwa). When she reaches adulthood, the mirror tells Ravenna that she may maintain her youth indefinitely if she kills Snow White and takes out her heart. Snow (now played by Kristen Stewart) escapes the kingdom when the queen sends her brother to escort her.

  Obviously, there's a great deal more to the story. For example, the Huntsman has yet to be introduced. Neither, for that matter, have the dwarves. And in this film, the men portraying the dwarves are of average or above average stature made to look like dwarves through the use of special effects as opposed to men who are actually shorter than 4'10"". There are comparisons being made between this film and Mirror Mirror, but they have very little in common, outside of the main characters. If more time had passed between the release dates, they'd stand separately and they should. It's like comparing Ridley Scott's Robin Hood to Robin Hood: Men in Tights.

4741645,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Lots of action in this movie, I enjoyed it for the most part.  Snow White as an action star...who knew?  Of course, it was really the Huntsman that kept my attention, and his character was a bit unusual for a hero, or as it turned out, one of the heroes.  It completely surprised me that there was no real romance here, was this intentional, or a case of the writers not wanting to go there?  Since Snow White already had her long lost childhood love, who really wasn't a love, as it turned out, most of the story dealt with our heroine hiding from her evil step-mother and all of the things she went through to destroy the lovely Snow White.  Okay, so some of that was a bit over the top, but the action sequences alone were worth some of the slow points in the movie, and it did keep things going.  The one thing that did leave me a bit unsatisfied, though, was wondering, what was going to happen after the ending...who would be the King to the new Queen Snow White???",1355616000,,971,4.25

I loved the Sanctuary ""fairy forest"" and again for the special effects. It was pretty amazing. Overall, I'll probably watch it again before the Jan. 2013 deadline.

I watched this with my girlfriend and although she wanted to watch it badly, it seemed that her attention was not held. There is the action/horror/suspense element as I said, just not much of the love story side.
The visuals were pretty striking and seamless with the surroundings, not sticking out like cheap CGI effects. I didn't feel like the story developed well, as far as delving deeper into the why of this characters background, and actually understanding his/her deeper emotions and reasoning behind this sudden willing determination. (you'll understand what I mean if you watch it) I understand there is only so much time you can put into a movie, it just feels as if some of the characters who would seem to have a richer background and possibly more dynamic personality, fell flat at times.
On the action side, there is a good amount of it. It is by no means an ""action"" movie, but there is enough to hold your boyfriends/husbands/best friends interest.
Overall I would say if you have a couple bucks lying around and you haven't seen Hunger Games, or one of the other sci-fi/fantasy/fairy tale movies that are out on Amazon Video now, go ahead and check it out.",1355270400,,1324,4.686695278969957

There will be some who may disagree on who that should have been!!!!  There was one thing left decidedly undone.

4742010,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Right off the bat: I'm not a teenaged girl.  I'm neither impressed by Chris Hemsworth's muscles, nor rabid over how Kristen Stewart's affair with director Rupert Sanders screwed over her ""Twilight"" co-star and ex(?)boyfriend Robert Pattinson.

That said, I hope I've just established my credibility when it comes to reviewing this film.

And I liked it just fine.

""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is an interesting, well-acted, enjoyable yet violent take on the Brothers Grimm tale, and one can certainly do worse than sitting down to enjoy it.

Though Stewart and Hemsworth and competent in their roles, the real stars of the tale are Charlize Theron and the CGI effects...both accomplishing their tasks splendidly throughout the film.

Theron does a stellar job--as is her habit--playing Ravenna, the Evil Queen.  Her quest to be the most beautiful woman in her kingdom is so malevolent even plant life perishes throughout the region.  And Theron seems to relish the role, thoroughly encompassing a cold, heartless woman who maintains herself by quite literally sucking the life out of every fair woman she encounters.  It is safe to say that it is Theron who ""owns"" this film, and it is she whom you will recall longest after the movie has ended.

As for the CGI, as always it ran the risk of overwhelming the film.  Here, however, I felt it performed its task of embellishment the movie with the technique necessary to tell the tale, and when it did draw attention to itself it was only to marvel how well this was accomplished, much in the manner of beautiful scenery or great acting.  As in, say, the ""Harry Potter"" films, it seldom drew away from the experience of watching the film, instead enhancing it in a necessary and stunning manner.

Chief among these moments would be Ravenna's magic mirror, to whom she makes the well known chant of ""who's the fairest of them all?""  Instead of merely reflecting her or invoking the image of the spirit within it, the mirror turned liquid, gloopily oozing down from its perch onto the floor only to rise in the evocation of a being under a shroud--a very eerie image indeed.  (I would have enjoyed seeing it get back upon the wall, but the movie did not supply that moment, alas.)

Additionally, the seven (initially eight) dwarves were quite effectively performed by normal-sized actors (including Brian Gleeson, Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins) whose faces were melded upon the heads of smaller actors.  It was seamlessly accomplished, though I did hear it created some resentment among ""little"" actors who felt slighted by their seeming exclusion.

I felt that Stewart and Hemsworth were fine, though I felt that their roles could have been performed by any other actors--in particular Stewart, whom I have never really felt is that accomplished an actress, nor certainly the ""beauty"" who would drive Theron into any jealous rage.  As for director Sanders, for whom ""Snow White"" was his first feature film, I felt the movie was nicely balanced and paced, and made for a very enjoyable afternoon.

All in all, a pleasant movie, and satisfying.  My only statement of caution applies to parents of  impressionable youngsters: you might be wise to take the tykes elsewhere, as the violence may unsettle them.",1355097600,,3251,4.926605504587156

4742341,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I am a long time fan of fairy tales and the retelling of fairy tells as long as there is something original in them from the writer/director etc. This movie ""borrowed"" a lot of things from other stories,

A few movies  that seemed to heavily influence the writer or director:

The Never Ending Story
Willow
Lord of the rings
Princess Mononoke( instead of cute Kodoma its fairies though,oooh)

The scenes were nicely shot ,the acting was good all except the main girl who played Snow White. I have  never seen any of the movies that she is famous for (gasp) and I can't say that I am sorry.

She didn't really have too many lines in the movie which is a good thing because if you notice, she keeps her mouth open the whole time and I kept looking at her large front teeth that seem to hang down lower then the rest. It was really distracting to me .

The character Snow White was pretty helpless, I thought this was going to be more of a kick butt warrior type Snow White because the pre-views. Nope. Aside from her neat sliding escape she is pretty lame.

My favorite line, "" Do you need a Bow-man?""

SO if you are a fan of those other types of movies I would watch it but to me it really doesn't add anything spectacular to the genre.",1354752000,3,1235,4.243589743589744

4742392,2,B005LAIHSQ,"It's a really beautiful, well-shot, grand looking movie. Truly fantastic. But some of the writing/situations are absurd. Snow is locked in a tower for years but looks like she's merely been out gardening -- some dirt smudges, newish clothes with sparkles, thin but not emaciated? And when she gets out, she's a little bit too much Sarah Connor, you know, for a young lady who has been locked up for the last ten years. And how nice of the Queen to have given Snow the jail cell with a fireplace. Also, it's Snow White -- black hair, alabaster skin?? Physically, that is just not Kristen Stewart. But that's not her fault. She just doesn't look that way and the producers/director did little to nothing to transform her into the proto-typical look of SW. Now the acting - Theron and Hemsworth are fine. In fact, I find Theron to overact in some scenes and as I watched the film, I could see why -- she was making up for Stewart. Not to drag on Kristen Stewart too much here - it's one of her best performances but it simply isn't good enough. She isn't pretty enough and she brings nothing to the role in terms of personal strength, resolve, inner-beauty - the qualities you expect Snow White to exude. What a shame because the technical aspects of the film are just stellar.",1354665600,3,1274,4.51948051948052

The wicked stepmom is extremely wicked but facinating to watch. You almost feel sorry for her but that would be wrong, wouldn't it?!
Snow white...well...I have never been much of a fan of this actress who plays her. She does an okay job but it feels like a repeat from Twilight..teenage angst and all. But as far as recommending it..yes..watch for the special effects. They are cool.",1354665600,,544,4.618556701030927

4742399,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I wanted to like this movie.  The cinematography, the sets and the costumes and the special effects were stunning.  The story is at least 200 years old and though told and retold, still has a lot of room for creativity and imagination.  Unfortunately at no point in the film did I care about anybody in it.

The huntsman is as wooden as Keaneau Reeves, but not nearly as handsome.  He's also a stage four alcoholic and yet somehow manages to fight supernatural creatures.  Since he becomes Prince Charming, what's he going to do, get loaded and smack Snow White around?  He was getting sauced as he kissed her.

Kristen Stewart --  The fairest in the land?  I don't know.  A pretty girl for sure and I guess the point is if the movie was interesting at all or her performance was at least good you wouldn't spend time thinking ""Is she the best looking actress they could find?  In Hollywood?""

The magic mirror was a whole load of CGI effects, but really didn't move the story forward or make you say ""wow"".  Actually it reminded me of when I did see similar effects and say ""wow"".  It was in Terminator 2, back in 1991, 21 years ago.

I don't really know if I think the film strayed too much from the original fairy tail, or was too much a slave to it.  They introduced, I suppose, the exact wrong amount of new plot-lines.  It would have been a better movie if they either just stuck to the original story, or totally reimagined it.  Either stay on the beaten path or stay in the weeds, don't give me ten minutes of familiar story followed by ten minutes of weird detour over and over.

What the heck was that scene with the troll, and why did they leave it in the movie?

I don't know who gave Rupert Sanders the directing gig, but he must have naked pictures of somebody at the studio.

All and all, it left me wishing I had not wasted the money renting this movie.",1354579200,3,1869,4.325648414985591

4742493,5,B005LAIHSQ,"The story of Snow White was started in the dark ages as a way to tell and perpetuate the story of Christ and his claiming of the world and eliminating evil.  This story, while not Disney style feel good treat, is probably a good representation of how the original story was probably told.  It is a very sinister, and yet uplifting tale of good over evil.  Little glimpses early on with Snow White reciting the Lord's Prayer while in captivity in the town is a forshadowing of the filth and evilness that will come and what she is going to have to endure to recapture the throne.

This is a fascinating, disturbing, and wonderful, ""alternate"" telling of the timeless tale.

4742561,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Well, actually some of the visuals are quite remarkable, but the plot and acting disappoint.

Well, technically speaking, the plot ""wasn't any better than I was expecting"", which isn't exactly the same as being disappointed. It sort of wanders around looking for the next special effect. And in the end there's a sort of showdown and the movie ends. And then you get another beer and look for one of the backup movies you rented, because while this movie is reasonably fun and sort of entertaining, it left me distinctly unsatisfied.

[edit] OK, I'm not being entirely fair: there is a trip sequence in the middle (keywords: dwarves, mushrooms) that is quite awesome. The rest of the movie, though... uh... I just can't recommend it. Definitely worth watching for that part, but if you get bored after the trip sequence, you have permission to turn it off and watch something else.",1354492800,,881,4.827814569536423

4742623,4,B005LAIHSQ,Anything With Charlize Theron and you basically cannot go wrong. She is the female Daniel Day Lewis; a true genius whos personal life experiences give performances that no silver spoon Actor/Actress can ever attain. the only reason I gave it 4 out of five stars is due to Kristen Stewart performance which was as cardboard and hollow as she is in her vampire movies.,1354492800,,366,4.734375
4742624,5,B005LAIHSQ,"I watched this movie and really liked it, the whole movie kept me interested.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1354492800,,118,4.619047619047619
4742625,3,B005LAIHSQ,"On the one hand, Charlize was incredible and played the perfect Queen. On the other, Kristen Stewart played her typical plain jane self. She doesnt know how to act and you cant tell this character apart from her Bella character except a slight accent change that was not believable. It was entertaining but could have been better with a change of Snow Whites character to another actor.",1354492800,,386,4.776119402985074
4742626,1,B005LAIHSQ,"Imagine a girl locked in a tower for twelve years who suddenly escapes into a haunted forest or some shit. Then, within the course of what seems like a few hours, the girl is hunted down by - you guessed it - a drunk, brawling, good-for-nothing hunter who is the only one brave enough to enter the haunted forest, capture the girl, and return said girl to a wicked queen who sucks souls from young maidens in order to stay young and beautiful.
Somehow the young girl convinces the drunk hunter to help her and they take off through the woods (this part is really fuzzy because I had to smoke a bowl in order to continue watching). There are some midgets dressed like the seven dwarves from the Disney version except they're all tough and grumpy and want to kill the drunk hunter (big surprise at this point).
In another amazing turn of events the young girl (the same one who spent twelve of her most formative years in isolation in a tower, mind you) eventually leads an army of people and midgets and shit against the evil queen. The girl even managed to find incredibly fitted armor (complete with those little boob cup things so you know she's a chick), learn how to ride a horse, and use a sword in an incredibly short period of time after having lived the last twelve years in isolation in a tower. This is a truly gifted girl.
As far as the acting goes, at least it was slightly better than the plot. Imagine a drunk Thor, a bored and aging super model/actress, and an actress who is as bad as the writing of almost all the movies she's been in. There are some cool fight scenes - sans acting, and the musical score isn't bad after a couple bowls.
Overall I think watching this movie caused the death of more brain cells than anything illicit I consumed during the 128 minutes of sensory water boarding called a movie. Save your money, your time, and your soul by watching the trailer and then banging your head against a brick wall while reciting ""The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner"" from memory over and over.",1354492800,3,2016,4.422043010752688
4742696,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I like the movie, however they could have replaced Kristin Stewart. She just doesn't display any range in her acting ability.

4742698,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Charlize makes this film work and that's why I original purchased it, being a fan or her work... and beauty. Theron's performance is wonderfully wicked and the special effects giving her an aged appearance really create a classic sense of gothic gloom. Stewart is decent, but ""fairest of them all""? I don't think so, she's a cute girl but not a classic beauty denoting purity and wonder... but it works overall. So far I've only watched the instant video version on my PS3 via the Amazon app, so it should be a drastic improvement visually when i get my Blu-ray order. The scope of the screenplay doesn't exceed the original tale, which is actually small in scope, so they did the best they could without adding completely foreign plot lines that would convolute the production... but it is a totally linear story experience that retains all we have come to know as Snow White. This movie sets along side Lord of the Rings etc, so in my opinion it's worth adding to the fantasy collection.",1354492800,,989,4.6571428571428575

4742704,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I decided to watch this despite kind of hating Kristen Stewart (with the exception of Panic Room) because the visuals in the trailer seemed pretty amazing-- I mean, the Mirror is a gold dripping figure, the contrasts of the snowy forest and the castle on fire, the epic Charlize Theron-bathing-in-milk sequence... just looked like visual candy to me. So I went for it... Yea, it wasn't worth it. You get all the best bits in the trailer-- seriously. The trailer is a better film than the actual movie. Kristen Stewart is predictably awful. You get the feeling Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are kind of trying but their characters are just as flat as the green screen this shit was shot against. So mostly I just felt bad for them.

Sucks, because more than once I got the feeling that, at any moment, the writers/directors could have turned it around. There was real potential here. But in the end its just a bunch of fluff. Unsatisfying and kind of boring too.",1354406400,,967,4.654970760233918

4742786,3,B005LAIHSQ,This movie had the potential for greatness but falls short. Charlize Theron is of course excellent as expected. I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart and here is another reason why. Kristen goes from not being able to hold a knife to leading an army and taking down the queen. Very unbelievable. The world however was very imaginative and beautiful. Battle scenes were almost good but usually bland and hurried. I wanted to like this movie but ultimately its just an average 3 out of 5.

4742793,1,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White and the Huntsman (2012). Extended Edition. Film by Universal. Story by Evan Daugherty. Direction by Rupert Sanders. Screenplay by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, Hossein Amini. Playacted by Kristen Stewart (Snow White), Chris Hemsworth (The Huntsman), Charlize Theron (Ravenna), Sam Claflin (William), as main characters.

The contemporary cinematographic industry often takes pleasure in ripping both scientific and legendary history --that is, history as recounted by objective narrators who base their account on unbiased research, as well as by inspired poets who base their tale on oral traditions which, though warped, contain essential historical truth. As an example of this ferocious trend, I can mention David Franzoni's ""King Arthur"" (2004), directed by Antoine Fuqua, which, pretending to be the retelling of the notorious Britannic monarch's historical exploits under the light of the newest discoveries of unbiased academic research, projects a fraudulent shadow of deception which not only shatters all Arthurian legends, but strikes mercilessly at the essence of history, not just deforming it, but obliterating it in a manner that far exceeds the most garbled of legendary disfigurations.

The Bavarian folk tale ""Schneewittchen und die sieben Zwerge"" (""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves""), compiled in 1812 by the brothers Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859), is not history. It is a fantasy which, though wrapped for children, enshrines an essence of human courage and hope, in an environment of love and hatred, honesty and deceit, where love and honesty triumph. Therefore, to retell the story dressed for adults instead of children, allows for substantial changes, as long as the heart of the tale --the triumph of faithful love under horrifying circumstances is not shattered... From its beginning, this movie promises such an adventure, and throughout most of it seems to deliver it reasonably well by the means of excellent cinematography and special effects, as well as mostly good acting, since the mediocrity of some of it does not substantially detract from the overall quality of the film. It even features a fair script (as far can be expected from contemporary cinematographic writing). But just as a single word can utterly destroy even an otherwise outstanding poem, one or two fleeting scenes can annihilate an otherwise good movie with many exceptional characteristics... Just as if, after constructing a monumental edifice of magnificent marble blocks, the architect were to remove the cornerstone, the entire edifice would collapse, so a story from which its heart --the essential quality that makes it memorable-- is removed, will also fail absolutely, even if the rest of it --cinematography, special effects, acting and even script-- were all magnificent. This is what has happened to the story of Snow White in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"".

This otherwise ingenious retelling of the Snow White tale has been devastated by two fleeting scenes which have obliterated the very reason of the story, its essence and heart. To be sure, the character of Snow White has been drastically changed, as she has been turned into a sort of Saint Joan of Arc and Conan the Barbarian, mixed into one, but damaging as this change is, it does not quite destroy the story. Despite the fact that it plays an important part of the movie, faithful love is ripped, minced and utterly defeated. This is accomplished in just two brief scenes --very brief, but overwhelming. Instead of exalting the power of constant love, Snow White and the Huntsman obliterates it, perhaps because it is the offspring of a contemporary society which has trampled thoroughly on true love, having lost any respect for constancy, and even the most basic understanding of it.

What could have been an excellent story retelling, and almost was, is only and empty carcass --a hallucination which, powerfully attracting as a seeming beautiful rose, once smelled yields the putrid scent of decaying carrion.",1354320000,2,4032,5.324960753532182

4742795,5,B005LAIHSQ,"I loved it. It sticks to the original story and is pure fantasy but with a realistic feel.  I was impressed with the actress who played Snow White too. I hated the twilight series and that was all i ever saw her in so I was worried about her skills but she proved me wrong.  And Charlize is outstanding as always. The cinematography is spectacular and special effects nice too. This is a great movie to each if you e joy fantasy a d want to escape for a short while. I usually can't watch a movie twice in a row but I did this one because I loved the haunted Forest scenes and the fungus that sprays hallucinogenic spores...

4742882,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Post Kristen Stewart scandal and all that, didn't know much about the movie. Rented it because it was .99 and I just wanted to kill time. Surprisingly, the movie pulled me in much more than I expected - special effects were really good, and it started out mostly with Charlize Theron, who was amazing. Then, the main star - Kristen Stewart - appeared, and it all sort of went downhill from there.

In fact, I can't think of as single other movie I've seen where everyone and everything works (okay, maybe not spectacularly, but they all worked) *except* for the main character. The huntsman worked, Ravenna's brother worked, Ravenna was amazing, even the Duke and his son worked. The dwarves all worked. But Snow White herself was the movie's undoing.

In crucial moments, when I felt honestly moved by the movie - I kept thinking, ""Come ON, Kristen. Give us SOMETHING - ANYTHING."" Everyone did pretty well to support this character, and it was the least believeable character in the entire movie. I don't get it. How could they have made such an amazing Ravenna and such a flop Snow White? I get that she's the highest paid actress around due to the Twilight franchise, but really - such a disservice to the rest of the cast, and the movie itself.",1354233600,2,1248,4.642533936651584

I mean, they really looked angry, like they wanted to stomp on something. With their front hooves. The sound was great. Some of the scenes were fantastic. In the middle of it, I wondered if the tale was an allegory about Viking usurpers and the restoration of apple cheeked English maidens to RT's(rightful thrones). But character.

4742957,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I wanted to rate this with one star, but I threw in a pity one for poor Chris and Charlize, stuck with trying to carry the movie since Stewart so obviously could not.

Stewart's acting is bad. Not hilariously bad like Nic Cage, but just painful to watch in a general sense. While relieved she didn't do her trademark lip biting that seems to be her facial expression of choice, I nevertheless found myself literally yelling at the tv, ""For god's sake, close your freakin' mouth!"" Maybe she had a severe cold for the duration of shooting the movie and couldn't breathe through her nose. I don't know. But it was so distracting that at one point I had to leave the room. The creepy part is the vacant, dead-eyed stare she has with everything. No one is home. I am convinced her body is an empty shell being animated by some high tech computer program.

The plot is riddled with so many holes that characters became lost in them. The special effects wavered back and forth between interesting (Ravenna reverting back to human form after the flock of birds) to cringe inducing (the whole white stag ripoff from Princess Mononoke). I just don't get what direction this movie was headed. I believe this movie could have been improved upon 100% by having Ravenna as the main character, and further exploring what made her the way she was. We get bits and pieces, and Charlize Theron could have easily pulled it off (with a less hokey script than she was presented with here). Hell, I'd take a movie that was all about The Huntsmen as opposed to what we got.

This movie is perfect. End of story.
Let's start with casting : in spite of many people apprehension, Kristen Steward is wonderful. She does and expresses so much with so little. Charlize Theron throws her whole heart into the pain and cruelty of the character. Chris Hemsworth is gorgeous and brooding (his accent is stuck on demo but you get used to it), the eight dwarves are the icing on the cake (much, much more than just a comic relief).
Next photography : Beautiful, just beautiful. The darkness is threatening, the light is enlighting, the colours teach the rainbow a thing or two.
The music : soaring and enchanting, all the way to the end credits with Florence and the Machine.
The directing : the action sequences are thrilling, fast and don't pull punches, the fairytale sequences want to make you believe.
As far as the narrative goes... I could go on for a while (don't hesitate to contact me to discuss)... but let's note that the ""love story"" is underplayed (and hence a lot sexier) than the overt Prince Charming (quite lovely and convincing too). The character with the most lines is actually the bad guy.
In short (too late), please watch and lemme know.",1353888000,,1260,4.68018018018018
4743306,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I bought the blu ray this Black Friday at a great discount, but since I'd never seen the movie, I decided to pay the $2 before opening it. Over half the movie could have been obliterated on the editing floor and I'd have been a happier woman. Tree branches turned into snakes, the forest floor teamed with bugs. I got that she was out of her mind with fear and confusion, but really, that could have been conveyed so much better. The only real saving graces to this movie are the rousing speech Snow White gives (though not on the same plane as Braveheart, LOTR: Return of the King, or Independence Day, as leaders' war speeches go) and the last five minutes. Having seen only the first Twilight movie, once, I had no idea what all the fuss was on Pinterest about Kristin Stewart being completely unable to emote. Her face changed to one of only three expressions throughout this film: gaping like a fish, confusedly frowning, and completely blank - the last of which I believe was supposed to convey her joy at seeing her ""beloved"" at the back of her throne room. The premise was good, and Charlize Theron played the evil queen Julia Roberts could only hope to be, but Snow White just fell flat.

4743369,3,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie had amazing potential and I truly wanted to love it. The general problem was either they just didn't know which direction to go in or someone went a little too nutty with the editing.

The Plot: Well, we know the basic idea of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, so no spoiler alert there. However elements were introduced in the story that seemed dropped in and never really explained or followed. For instance, Snow is led to safety by some (magical?) animals. A brief scene early in the movie of Snow White saving a bird MIGHT explain this, but you never really are sure.  SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT: Also (and my entire family felt the same way)a troll is introduced in the middle of the movie, Snow White seems to tame it... but we're not sure why AND we never see this troll again. We loved the troll and thought he would come in later to help in the big final battle, but no. We definitely wanted more troll!  Later she gets a ""blessing"" from the king of the forest, but again we just don't understand why - Snow White just didn't seem that special.

Cast:
Okay I loved the cast, with one notable exception: Kristen Stewart. What I've come to realize is that Ms. Stewart's role of Bella Swan (Twilight movies) is the extent of her acting ability. Perhaps an actress who could bring more vibrancy to the role would have sparked up the movie and even helped the audience be more amenable to believing that Snow White was more special than meets the eye.
Now, Charlize Theron almost made up for a weak Snow White, she was tremendous over the top the way an evil queen should be.
Chris Hemsworth was just right for the Huntsman (how can you go wrong with Thor in leathers and an axe :) and the ""seven dwarfs"" were all amazing actors.

Is it a terrible movie? No, but it could have been a really enjoyable movie and that's what is most disappointing.",1353801600,2,1854,4.425219941348973

4743423,2,B005LAIHSQ,"The experience I had viewing Snow White and the Huntsman was entirely unpleasant.

I selected a seat about halfway up the steps of the theatre and just to the left of centre aisle. Typically, this is the ideal location when viewing a film. Unfortunately, the woman behind my on this occasion felt it appropriate to have not one, not two, but THREE cell phone conversations during the picture. I can understand if there were an emergency which necessitated her taking the call, but the calls -- from what I could deduce -- were from a relative of hers, discussing their Holiday plans (which were surely months away, at this point), and from a coworker during which she discussed the pros and cons of the employee which just joined their organization. In the third phone call, she had the nerve to complain about MY behavior during the film. Due to this woman I missed 8-10 minutes of the film.

Additionally, I rarely purchase concessions while visiting the theatre due to their absurd prices. On this occasion, however, I decided to break that pattern and purchase some snacks, as I had eaten a very small breakfast that morning (I was running late to drop my son off, I memory serves). I was sad to find that the popcorn was overcooked and very dry. In addition, the bag of M&Ms I purchased had only 3 blue M&Ms (my favorite flavor). As you may imagine, having spent over $10 on these snacks, I was audibly perturbed by the quality of these snacks. As I had attended the film with my in-laws, I tried to keep any profanities to a minimum, but I rightly voiced my frustration over the quality of the concessions at this theatre. After a brief monologue (no more than 2 minutes) to other movie-goers on my row, the woman behind me began asking me to be quiet -- AFTER SHE HAD ALREADY TAKEN MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS DURING THIS SINGLE MOVIE!!! As you can tell, the experience was COMPLETELY unpleasant.

4743424,3,B005LAIHSQ,"""As a spin on the Grimm fairy tale and as a stand-alone dark fantasy, it functions much more effectively on a moderate basis than the flamboyant Avatar. In terms of its premise, it functions in bringing a dark and enjoyable environment that works to separate the Disney cliches attached to the film along with some intriguing set designs, laugh-out-loud dry humour from the dwarves, landscape shots, and action featured in a clear, non-cinema verite style.

4743430,3,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie had me confused. It didn't know what it wanted to be. The only character that was clearly defined was the man-hating Queen.

Snow White's companion was supposed to be devoted to her but at times had a mean streak. The evil forest was supposed to be so scary that the only man who had been there refused to return. Later on in the movie the Queen miraculously found a whole group of men willing to go into the forest. The dwarfs were no more than people with dwarfism; not the legendary fairy folk dwarfs who mined the mountains. They said this but I didn't see much evidence.

Snow White was sometimes enchanted and sometimes not. The girl chosen to portray her as a child certainly did not have raven hair, fair skin or red lips. There was nothing to say that she was not just another ordinary child. As an adult she got limited help from the animals of the forest but was mostly on her own. Sometimes she was magic and sometimes not. She didn't seem to know her own destiny except to say once in a while that she was to be queen someday. Other than that she was a typical helpless movie female. She even meets a god-like animal but nothing really comes of it. I didn't get the locked in the tower for 10 years bit either. It seems the directors needed to fill in the gap between her childhood and adulthood so they just locked her out of sight in a tower until he story could resume.

To sum it up, special effects okay, storyline, needs work.",1353801600,,1456,4.306569343065694
4743431,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This is why I only gave it four stars because I thought it was lacking in some places.
I rented this from the library:

 It's supposed to be a modern day retelling of the Snow White and The Seven Dwarves) cartoon movie set to real action but it's too dark and too medieval for what they told in this version and I do like medieval stories because of the swords and weapons that they use, (I'm a big fan of swords) but a troll, really? an dthe names of the dwarves were all wrong (I think I counted 8 of them at one time and the one that died when he got the arrow in the back by the name of 'Gus' wasn't in the cartoon version, I was wondering how they made actor Bob Hoskins look so small (smaller than he is in real life as I saw him in Unleashed with Jet Li and I think he's only about 5 foot 5 inches in real life, but he looks even smaller here, I guess it's just a camera trick they use. I guess I just like the cartoon version better because it was so comical in it's telling of the fairy tale. And Chris Hemsworth did a pretty bang up job as the Huntsman but I don't see the correlation between this version and the disney cartoon one. Some of the special effects kept me wondering too and the evil queen's wardrobe was pretty cool. I see that they made the cover picture on the dvd of the queen a bit larger as if she's the main title character point for the movie. The scenery and locales were spectacular because I watched the extras on the disc and found out that they filmed parts in Stotland and South Wales, I've always wanted to hike through some of those areas of Scotland but they did say that it's freaking cold there in those parts they filmed in.

4743613,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow white and the huntsman was a decent movie with some interesting twists to it! As I recall from hearing the story in my youth the huntsman was a minor character but here he is one of the main players. Back in the day it was called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the dwarfs being some folks who worked mining precious stones and minerals having a fun time singing and whistling all day long. well these dwarfs are a bit different, they are more like societies rejects and have a decidedly negative view of life!
Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart both gave good performances and looked dazzling at the appropriate times. Chris Hemsworth(""Thor"") was a nice choice for the huntsman. In the beginning of the movie I did not recognize him as he looked very much the part, being set in a time before folks had running water in their homes which for the most part were simple huts. But of course he cleaned up real good by the end when he got to the palace, and he had to make that choice between doing the right thing(saving Snow) and just going back to whatever was left of his old life! All in all a decent movie!",1353715200,,1116,4.3701923076923075

Was she out of her depth here? I am seeing a lot of praise for Theron and I actually found her performance to be less believable. Chris Hemsworth's performance was most notable in my mind. If the rest of the acting were 5-star, perhaps Stewart would have fallen behind. But, this is not a 5-star film and I think she held her own. It was a new and dark twist on the story we grew up with and truer to the original. It had much more action and a much more subtle romance. I enjoyed the action and the tougher, central role of Snow White in the evil queen's demise. But, I think the story would have benefitted from an obvious and discernible romance between Stewart and Hemsworth.  These are two beautiful, passionate people. Let's be honest here: we wanted it, we longed for it and we didn't get it. Disappointing! This is a visually stunning movie and the actors are no less visually stunning. Is it predictable? Of course! Aren't all fairy tales? It does lack some depth and cohesiveness at points.

- Chris Hemsworth has the acting chops and the look, but the poor script made his lines sound flat, forced, and at times, a little hokey.
-  Charlize Theron was superb, and yet underused, leaving her character painfully unrealized.

4744117,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I have never seen any of the Twilight movies and that was deliberate on my part. Not my thing. OK, nothing wrong with that, each to his/her own. All the pictures I have seen of Kristen Stewart have shown one basic expression and I more or less thought ""yeah, whatever, she's pretty, so what?"" I had read a couple of reviews concerning her acting (or lack thereof) so was hesitant to see the movie. However, I like Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth seemed pretty good so I and a friend watched it.

I don't watch a movie to tear it apart. I watch it for entertainment and how I FEEL while watching it. Let's face it, Charlize Theron stole the show. She was magnificent! I almost found myself rooting for her but she had clearly gone all the way over to the dark side.

Spoiler Alert!!!

It did eventually become clear that she had experienced some major bad stuff at the hands of men, some at a very young age, and that her mother placed this spell on her but she went over the edge. Way, way over the edge. However she did it in a very belivable way as you could watch her going downhill.

Chris Hemsworth was very good as the Huntsman. You could see his agony and his need to drown his sorrows. I felt his Scottish was rather good and enjoyed that part very much. I was very disturbed to discover they CGI'd the dwarves. Why not use real actors? However, I enjoyed them very much and they did a wonderful job. Sam Claflin was good too and was downright wicked with the bow.

Now we come to Kristen Stewart. OK, she's not the best actress. In a world that demands perfection in every way people want their entertainment perfect and to take them over the edge. (And yet, what about all those grade D cult movies that are nothing but death and gore? The acting is certainly not top of the line for them!) Having said that, what I saw was perhaps not the best FACIAL expresssions, but her body clearly expressed what she was doing. She's actually a pretty good body actess. When I took my attention off her face to how her body expressed what she was delivering I found it made a big difference. Not everyone can be the perfect person everyone else wants them to be and I thought she did a good job. It's my perception she doesn't lack emotional depth, she lacks the ability to express it on her face. In my mind there is a difference.

I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it again. This is not the Disney fairy tale, this is a gritty, dark, and occasionally disturbing but enjoyable movie where the good guys win again.",1353196800,,2538,4.355179704016913

4744208,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Charlize Theron has had a couple of very good roles this year.  Here as the evil witch, and in ""Prometheus"" as Meredith Vickers.  She's got the villain role down pat, I would say.  And in my opinion, she stole the scenes from Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth in this movie.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie.  Just be forewarned that it's not going to follow the same exact plot as the original tale that you heard as a child.

Kristen Stewart plays the main character, Snow White.  Life starts off pretty good for her, being the daughter of the king.  While she was still young, a woman pretending to be a damsel in distress wins over her father's affections.  This woman, Ravenna, weds the king and becomes her stepmother.  Ravenna eventually murders the king and brings in her own army to take control of the castle.  Snow White is sent to confinement and spends much of her childhood in a locked room.  Eventually, she gets out and escapes into the haunted forest.  The Queen sends a reluctant huntsman to track down Snow White.  The Huntsman, who is suffering from personal issues of his own, falls for Snow.

Anyway, this show portrays the story a little bit differently from the original story.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  The TV show, 'Once Upon a Time"", also put their own twists on the Snow White story.  I suppose you have to make the story more appealing to different generations of viewers.  The production and the special effects are top notch.  The costumes and the sets are also well-made.  They are what you would expect from a high-budget movie.  There are plenty of memorable scenes in this movie.  I particularly enjoyed the scenes with Queen Ravenna and her magic mirror.  And the movie wisely took the time to invest in Ravenna's backstory, to give her character more depth.

What we did not get much of is the Huntsman's backstory.  We are told that he was married and lost his wife.  Chris Hemsworth was fine for the role.  He pulled it off and carried the part well, in other words.  He was believable.  Kirsten Stewart, ofcourse, was more than capable of playing her role.  Her Snow possess a physical and a martial prowess that the original Snow from the storybook did not have.  Yeah, this is one chick that can kick some butt.  The storybook version was a delicate young woman, not the very capable swordswoman that Stewart portrays here.  The Snow White in this movie is much closer to Ginnifer Godwin's butt-kickin' television version from ""Once Upon a Time"".  This ain't your momma's Snow White!",1353024000,,2547,4.672686230248307

Charlize Theron was more fun to watch though the role was not very complex.  She seemed to do a lot of screaming.  The relationship between the huntsman and Kristen was not well done at all.

4744557,3,B005LAIHSQ,"It's been years since there was a fresh retelling of a fairy tale. A dark, romantic epic tinged with magic is what Snow White & the Huntsman aspired to. Alas, the fatal combination of a lack of chemistry and a lackluster musical score make it a somewhat pondering experience.

The trailers make this look like an action-packed epic in the tradition of earlier box office franchises like The Lord of the Rings. There are some good things about it, like the exquisite costume designs by Colleen Atwood. Some scenes are very well written and staged, among them the infamous apple sequence. And the cast is quite good... it's just too bad they don't have better material, in the hands of a more experienced director, to work with. Sometimes films just don't work. It can be a combination of things. For me, this one fell flat. There is no chemistry between the leads. Most of the music is either nonexistent or completely underwhelming. A decent score by an A-list composer would have done wonders for a script that meanders a bit and is downright dull at times. It is full of good ideas that aren't executed to the best of abilities. It's not a good thing when you reach the climax and think, ""Oh, good, it'll be over soon.""

Out of the four other people I saw this with, two of them liked it, two were entertained but unimpressed, and I was bored. It's a matter of opinion when it comes to whether or not you'll be entertained, but either way this never reaches its full potential.",1352764800,9,1479,4.556390977443609

My daughter pestered me to see this movie, so one saturday when my wife was gone visiting her sister I made popcorn and sat down to watch this movie with my 10 year old baby girl.
It was a decent adventure for awhile as Chris Hemsworth fronted the first half of the movie and Stewart kept her mouth shut.
But then, she began to try and act.
Kristen Stewart was horrible giving her little ""we have to fight"" speech. Granted, the writers were as much at fault for that dialogue, but in my opinion, she just cannot act. I picture her trying to do Shakespear and cringe.
I thought my daughter wanted to see the movie because she was a Stewart fan, but it turned out it was Chris Hemsworth she was into. We had a good laugh over that.
It was a pity that Charleze Theron played the role as the evil queen. I didn't like her character, but she, at least, CAN act. And she's far better looking than Stewart.",1352678400,40,1080,4.273170731707317

So many reviewers have already gone into the details of the story here, I won't add to that. Instead, I'll stick to what I think works and doesn't work about the film overall.

What works: Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron. Both are outstanding actors portraying complex, interesting characters--but their talents are wasted here. Stewart is an albatross around their necks--as one reviewer here noted, Hemsworth seemed to be pleading in his scenes with her for something, anything for him to work with. Both he and Theron have to carry her in every scene they share.

Stewart has one facial expression, even in her ""death"" scene. She always looks constipated. Acting must be a painful process for her. I can only hope if there's a sequel, it will be focused on the Huntsman, as has been rumored.  I could also see a film delving into Ravenna's past--the glimpses of her childhood in the film were intriguing.",1352678400,3,1170,4.610576923076923

I have to say KSTEW, is the most attractive pouter, that I have ever seen.  But after a while, you have to ask, does this girl know how to smile?  Or does she even know what a smile is?  She just depresses the film to the point where you start to think that you need therapy.

Visually, it is a stunning movie, with tons of effects and eye-popping visuals.  Which is a hallmark of Rupert Sanders commercial and short-film work.  But the plot consists of a ton of events that aren't connected in any way.  Which is shocking, since Rupert, is a master at telling a story in his early work.  He is also a master of getting you to feel the emotion that his characters are going through.  All you feel in this movie is depression.

This movie proves once again what a great actress Charlize Theron actually is and Kristen Stewart should take note from her.  Kristen Stewart is cast as Snow White and, in and of itself, this would make good casting but you just cannot forget that she is currently playing Bella in the Twilight saga which comes across as much the same role and acting as this one.  The moody looks, the love triangle, a lot of nighttime shooting, yes that can describe both this movie and Twilight.  It would have been better to cast someone else at this time.

The dwarves were hilarious and a number of British faces that I recognised from other favourite movies.  So funny see their faces on little dwarf bodies - Ray Winstone as a dwarf anyone - laugh out loud.  I did have some tears for the dwarves as well at one point but won't say why as it would be a spoiler.

In the extended there is some quite graphic scenes that made my stomach heave slightly.  I assume these are not in the regular version, so if you are at all squeamish, don't watch the extended version.

This is NOT a retelling of the old fairy tale we all know from childhood. It is much darker and more violent,thus should not be viewed by persons under 14. Having that said,the film is a visual treat,but I found the going just a little slow until Snow White escapes her imprisonment and starts her long road back to restore the kingdom of her father with the help of the Huntsman.
The story finds a young Snow White without a mother,soon into the film. Later that day the King`s troops fight against a dark force of men,not of this world,as they disintegrate upon being struck. In the middle of this dark force is a barred wagon in which the King and his men find a beautiful woman,chained(Theron).The very next day she becomes wed to the King. In their bed that night she kills the King and instantly becomes Queen. The King's loyal subjects fight but it is no use and some,including a young boy friend of Snow White,William,flee the castle. Snow White herself is imprisoned in one of the castle towers for years as the Queen and her brother rule the Kingdom.
When Snow White becomes of age she finally manages to escape her captors and flees into the countryside. Guided by two birds she is led to a white horse which carries her far into a swamp,but is bogged down and can go no farther. The princess flees farther into the swamp/bog/forest where she finally collapses. Back at the castle a Hunstman is hired by the Queen to find the escaped princess. He tracks her down in short order,but something prevents him from releasing her to the Queen's brother. Instead he becomes her protector and they flee ever farther through the bogs and swamps and into the forest. It is there the Hunstman finally realizes who it is he is protecting,and they meet up with a band of dwarves,who pledge their allegiance to the princess.
In the meantime the princess's girlhood friend William,finds out she is still alive,and incognito,joins the Queen's brother and his men in the search for the princess. Back with the dwarves the princess and the Huntsman travel through an enchanted fairy forest where the princess comes face to face with a white reindeer with huge antlers. None of the dwarves have ever viewed this sight,and as the animal blesses the princess,an arrow flies straight into the reindeer,killing it. Some of the Queen's men have found them. In the ensuing battle revenge is made but one of the dwarves dies. The next morning the princess and William take a walk in the woods,talking. When the princess takes a bite out of an apple William gave her,she slips into a coma. The Queen has poisoned her and changes back into her normal body. The others come to her rescue but it is too late. William kisses her goodbye and she is taken to his fathers castle. There William instigates the men to up-rise and fight against the evil that rules the land. Before they ride the Huntsman visits the princess and also kisses her. After he leaves the princess slowly comes back to life and joins the troops outside. She inspires the men to fight alongside her and take back what is rightfully theirs.
A long and protracted battle takes place as the troops face many obstacles just to get into the castle. Once in,the princess inches her way along and travels the long and windy stairs to the Queens room. The two battle for supremacy. The princess is outclassed most of the way until,just as the Queen has her down and is about to take her heart,she quickly stabs the Queen in Her heart and kills her. The film ends as the princess,now Queen,finally reigns over the restored Kingdom.
Within the first part of the film that I earlier referenced that was slow in the building,there occurred some noticeable faux pauxs. When the princess finally escapes her room and locks the Queens brother in,we see her fleeing in one moment and then brother is suddenly in pursuit of her(how did he get out so quickly).Another such scene involves her escape to the outside of the castle walls through sewers and by jumping into the ocean. She finally comes upon a white horse and finally after all that time,the Queens troops are suddenly hot on her trail. And I watched the scar that the princess gave the Queens brother with a nail,come and go and change more than a few times. The editors weren't watching what they were doing. The film finally picks up after this as the princess escapes through the swamp/bog and meets up with the Hunstman. I actually became more emotionally involved at this point,which hadn't been the case up to this point. From here on the film builds upon itself and the inclusion of the dwarves was nice,as was the CGI involved to make normal men that size. The make up and wardrobe people are to be commended here for a job well done;with the changes in costumes and make up(Theron especially)from scene to scene,in some cases,it must have been a daunting task all around. The acting is generally solid,except for the very person the film revolves around Kristen Stewart. I thought she lacked the believability to convince me she had that all-so important inner strength that would propel her to become a Queen on her own. This I think is another reason the film was so slow to get off of the mark. Her credibility improved with the Hunstman on the scene,but he really just masked her deficiencies.
Technically speaking this DVD contains both the theatrical and extended versions of the film in their original w/s a/r of 2:35:1. The only extras are commentary and a featurette.
All in all,once you get past the slow start,this film starts to pick up quite well. The cast is a solid one,excepting the princess Stewart,who needs some improved acting chops and who was carried a good portion of the way by her co-stars. This is not a fairy tale for the small fry as it is violent and scary. 3 1/2-4stars.",1352419200,,6113,4.7193638914873715

About the movie: It's worth watching for the cinematography and occasionally whimsical story line, but falls short of what it could have been with a more well rounded cast. I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said before, but Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth are fantastic and Kristen Stewart is at best flat and at worst boring. I still recommend it however for 2 hours of pure mindless escapism and mostly fun if that's what you're in need of or looking for.",1352246400,,674,4.760683760683761

The writer must have been sadly disjointed to see this chick cast in the film.
Just stop already and leave the acting to professionals.
stop trying and just vanish please do us all a favor spare us your ridiculous open mouth routine.
I will say this the supporting cast carried her through the entire film and her lack of talent is most obvious and most disturbing in this film.
she stood there dumbfounded and never once added anything except her sheer lack of commitment to the film how could she do otherwise. (a moron is a moron )
I waited very patiently for her to warm up to the role, truthfully she never did !!
She stumbled through the entire film and never  did the theme change  the cast was incredible and the script thought provoking , but they should have simply cast someone else for the lead, and left her in twilight mode its a role that suits her best.
I avoided the twilight series for that reason alone twenty minutes into the film i wanted to scream and shut it off.
She is simply the most mindless stupid actress i have ever encountered.
The film could have been incredible  but sadly failed because of its leading actress .

However, both my wife and I looked at each other in disbelief at the ending of this movie. The acting looked dramatic but the dialogue fell far flat. How the heroine defeated the bad queen wasn't apparent despite obvious attempts to setup an understanding of it previous.

***SPOILER***

More than anything else, it just felt like there would be a romantic aspect to this movie. The best friend boy as a child who lets nothing stop him from finding her. The rugged Huntsman who's redeeming himself for the guilt of his wife's death. There are numerous opportunities for this to have been something more than what it was. Maybe it couldn't happen because the director was getting a little out of movie romancing from Kristen Stewart of his own?",1352160000,,840,4.700680272108843

4745161,3,B005LAIHSQ,I love fairy tales and I really could not wait to see this movie.  It has beautiful costumes and very impressive special effects.  It is a cross of fairy tale and sword fighting.  One would never imagine Snow White looking like Joan of Arc when she is riding the horse with her army in her effort to free her kingdom from the reigns of an evil witch.  It is a kind of movie that will entertain the family but I would not recommend it for very small children.  Some fighting scenes are quite savage like.

Kristen Stewart's acting, as always, IMO, lacked, but she was a little better here than in the Twilight Sagas. Charlize did well but a little over the top. The fantasy and action was much better on the big screen and the story, on repeat view at home, became somewhat tiresome. Worth seeing though.",1352073600,,460,4.621951219512195

4745166,5,B005LAIHSQ,"Although this is a somewhat darker version of Snow White than we are perhaps familiar with, Snow White & The Huntsman was very well done.  The cast were for the most part perfectly chosen for their individual roles, with Charlize Theron (Ravenna) leading the way.  Ms. Theron was the quintessential evil queen, brilliantly portraying her character as so thoroughly wicked, I felt the urge to run and hide.  She was so stunningly beautiful and hideously deranged that she stole the show and is the reason I gave the movie 5 stars.  Kristen Stewart did a commendable job at playing the part of Snow White, the victim.  I know that many fans of the ""Twilight"" series love to hate her, but she in no way should make or break the film for anyone wanting to see it.  She is neither an amazing actress nor a terrible one, but still her performance was solid.  She is very adept at expressing emotion with her face rather than through her lines (of which she had very few in many parts of the film). Her character just wasn't as important as either the evil queen or the huntsman.  Which brings us to Chris Hemsworth, who was another well-chosen cast member.  At the beginning of the movie, he played a very convincing drunken fool, a huntsman chosen only because he had survived the ""dark forest"" rather than any talent for bounty hunting. As the drama progressed, he slowly transformed into the hero of the show, but still retained a few warts (weaknesses) so as to be believable. The other hero, played by Sam Claflin, is also worth mentioning for his strong performance as William, the boyhood friend of Snow White.  Sam Spruell is another actor who deserves recognition for his intense portrayal of Finn, Ravenna's weak brother. Rounding out the cast are the men who portrayed the band of dwarves, each one brilliant in their own way, some subtle and some very much in your face, but all well done.  Of course, the other star of the film, the special effects team, was amazing. The film was a beautiful blend of reality and make-believe and is well worth losing touch with the real world for a couple of hours.",1352073600,,2107,4.621983914209116

My opinion of her has not changed. This take on the Snow White story, mixed in with a liberal dose of fantasy battle, is profoundly flawed. Stewart is horribly cast in the lead, incapable of showing any more expression than her usual sullenness, and cannot act even if her life depended on it. The movie would have benefitted from a director who knew what he was doing, a better crafted story that wasn't trying to pander to the audience coming to see the leading lady, and a leading actress capable of emotional range. Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron, who are much better than the material deserves, should be in a better movie.

This re-envisioning of the Snow White fairytale has the Evil Queen imprisoning her for years while she undermines and controls the kingdom.  Snow White escapes into a dark enchanted forest where just about everything is out to drug or kill you and the Queen sends out a Huntsman (a drunken man who recently lost his wife) to bring her back.  Of course, he ends up on her side and there is the love interest between them that never really materializes (will there be another movie for that?).  There's also a nobleman who knew the princess as a young girl who still has a thing for her, but that whole subplot really goes nowhere.  Maybe, they just didn't have the time for it in leading up to all of the action.  The thing that struck me as the strangest, however, was having Snow White say a Catholic prayer in one scene...since there was no other religious element in the movie save the covert pagan one of having Snow White meet the Lord of the Forest.

The Evil Queen's reasons for why she sucks the life out of people and lands is explained, at the very least...making her slightly sympathetic.  Snow White is sort of an enigma, as you feel like you really don't get to know her.  Other than that, the movie is filled with small faeries that shimmer with pixie dust, the traditional troll/bridge, and (of course) the Seven Dwarves.  They are one of the best things in the movie, the most human in some ways.

Overall, not a bad movie but not the best.  Worth owning if you like fantasy movies with some nice special effects mixed in with some action scenes.",1351728000,,1805,4.483180428134556

4745617,3,B005LAIHSQ,"A: She was exactly what I expected, based on everything else I've seen her in. She expresses every emotion, whether it's anger, fear, or determination with a look of constipation - furrowed brow, gritting teeth, etc. She does a lot of running in this film, and I have to say that she actually does this well. Perhaps she could find a film where she portrays a marathon runner, and she would probably be praised.

Charlize's evil queen is total camp, but she's great. She expresses her evilness with a steely smirk and a slooooow, drawling British accent. Chris Hemsworth is always fun to watch, and he plays the Huntsman with an equal measure of strength and humor. It's very fortunate these two actors are able to balance Stewart's blandness.

The special effects are quite stunning, as anyone who saw the trailer already knows. We see too little (pun intended) of the dwarfs, all portrayed by great British actors. They make their appearance pretty late in the film, but add a jolt of fun to a sometimes dark story.

This was a decent film, but not one I will watch again.",1351641600,3,1074,4.6421052631578945

I recommend this movie.,1351641600,,343,5.142857142857143
4745619,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Somehow I knew this would stink. Despite me hoping it woudn't, it just STANK. Besides Charlize Theron, there is not one redeaming quality about this film. I have no idea what the director was thinking. How did this movie come to pass and why did it make so much money at the box office???

So many issues with this film-where to begin?! Kristen Stewart. Sigh. Very pretty but seriously, utterly, devoid of any emotion aside from uncomfortable confusion. I have not seen any of her more independant films, but I hear she can actually act. Not seeing it here. The story goes, when the girl(Snow White) comes of age(I'm merely assuming it's 16) she will be the most fairest of them all bla bla bla and destroy the evil Queen and her reign of terror. Oh, and I guess that includes leading an army and actually FIGHTING with a large sword that she apparently has never used before and -Oh by the way she was locked up since forever in a dark, cold tower away from the world but she acts completely normal.

The Huntsman: Another huge sigh. Was he called that because he was supposed to be hunting Snow White(whom he finds in a matter of minutes it seems) or is he a renown huntsman of some kind? And what the heck was up with that ridiculous half scottish, half something accent Helmsworth was attempting to use? His character is so pointless it hurts.

The Dwarves: Again. POINTLESS. The action. Pointless. Plot. Stupid. Why are there 5 star reviews of this??? Is this literally the best thing they've ever watched?

Charlize Theron as the evil queen did a fair job and actually ACTED, but even she couldn't lift this film past anything watchable. It's just very dissapointing to watch something, that could have gone a completely different way, but was just so blah.",1351641600,2,1763,4.6050955414012735

It definitely strove to be a ""fresh"" retelling of the story, and succeeded to some degree, but I felt like the things they added to make it more ""unique"" wound up just being more clichs that were just new to Snow White, rather than genuine innovative.

For all the rich visuals, I never felt completely immersed and there was no broken ground - everything looked like something that had been done already and done better. Charlize Theron's character should have been much juicier, a queen that you rooted against but enjoyed watching. She simply was not fun to watch. The movie was unsuccessful at creating a sense of dread. By the time the dwarves showed up, I was completely checked out and the rest of the movie - too long, by the way - was a complete drag.",1351468800,2,713,4.622047244094488

The trailer had made me think this was going to be a cool movie about this princess learning to become a warrior, taught by the hot Huntsman, whom she would end up having a thing with. Well, I don't want to give away anything, but let me just say that you get a couple of tepid bits of what I expected, but not a lot. I also thought Theron wasn't great -- and I generally like her. Her accent was bad (always annoying to me), and her ""losing it"" parts just didn't cut it. Back to the talent they wasted: the great Ian McShane, playing a small role (no pun intended) as a dwarf. I see that man on screen, I want MORE! I can't help but feel like a bunch of material must have ended up on the cutting room floor, yet they chose to leave in much that could have (and should have) gone. Dwarves singing, etc. -- CUT IT!  Kristen Stewart actually wasn't bad -- did a credible job in her ""Henry the V rallies the troops"" rip-off scene.

I'm hoping she keeps mailing in her performances so she can just go away. Hemsworth is good here, although I think he's underutilized as well.

However, I thought she was the one weak point in the movie.  She probably should have changed her interpretation of her character; it seemed a little forced and almost fake.  Interesting Biblical references throughout the movie...resurrection, forbidden fruit...that sort of thing.

I was surprised by the movie, but still not so much, to say woow - - - - The problem I saw here was not so much with the story, or costumography. The casting was for the most part, all wrong, and that ruined a possibly a quite good movie. Charlize Theron is one of my favorite actresses, and she did a great job, with what she had been given to work with.

Chris Hemsworth - - - Great choice for the huntsman

There it ends - - - - I do not follow Kristen Stewart's acting career, for that matter I do not follow any of the careers. - - - - Even less their personal lives, I really do not give one toss about privacy of these people, who chose a profession in which they are supposed to portray certain characters AND emotions.

I of course HAVE NOT seen the Twilight movies, nor I seriously doubt I will ever see them - - - I saw Kristen for the first time in this movie, and I can honestly say, that if this is how she acts, she has definitely missed the calling. There is just something missing in ""her"" - - - a charisma, an eye catcher - - - Something is just not there - -

Kristin Kreuk would be perfect for the role of Snow White, or Mary Elisabeth Winstead, OR - - - Elisabeth Harnois - - - She has certain innocence within her, certain cuteness, and she actually knows how to act . . . . That guy William - - - They should have killed him at the start of the movie, and work more on the Huntsman and Snow White's romantic side of the story - - - - There was potential, but they wasted it - - primarily with bad casting for the Snow White - - - and script.

Not to mention, that the character of William was something to be desired for - - - Most characters were shallow, and boring actually,his was one of the worst - -

- The rest of the cast did what they could. . . . . Given the Material they had. . . . Music score was nice. I liked the song - Florence + The Machine: ""Breath of Life""

Scenery was good - - -

Now one of the biggest failures of the movie, which was supposed to be climatic, was downright a complete WTF - - - Motivational speech just after she wakes up in the castle - - - WTF and once again WTF - - - - It definitely did not motivate - - I mean I'd desert her the moment she'd finish with her speech - - - -

Well it is hard to top William Shakespeare's Henry the V. speech - - - Quote:

""We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother; be never so vile. This day shall gentle his condition. And gentlemen in England now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here, and hold their manhood's cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.""

But come on, they didn't even try - - - it made absolutely no sense - - - The final battle ( Possible Spoilers )- - - It was illogical, and made no tactical sense - - - ( Dwarfs holding the gatehouse, I mean come on, if one would see gates opening, one would Immediately send troops to retake the gates, OK if you forget that - - what do you do first, when you enter the castle you take the high ground, battlements and the gate house, not fighting in the court yard )

Maybe it is just me, but I notice this kind of things in movies, when there are battles in them - - To name two biggest issues I had with battle - - - Few small details and it would make the whole final scenes much better - - - One could make an epic finale, but they just sided through it - - - Boring actually.",1351296000,2,3542,3.848901098901099

I did find this movie entertaining, but I think it could have been better.
Charlize Theron steals the show, hands down.  I hate Kristen Stewart as Snow.
This movie wouod have been much better with a different actress in that role.
Her acting sucks, and she always seems sad.  She's just a depressing person in my opinion.
The dwarves are awesome!!!  They totally add the comic relief that Kristen Stewart kills. And you have a Norse god in the mix too!!  How can you not like Chris Helmsworth?  He's a bad a$$ pure and simple.  If you're a guy and you don't want to be him then you are lying!

The imperfections in the acting remind me of the tale of the persian carpet.  Each persian carpet has a n incorrect knot built into it, because perfection is only possible in the hand of god.  The story is filled with forgiveness and extraordinary power.  Characters who can feel pain and forgive.  Even the evil queen is filled with sorrow, longing and confusion; lonely and pathetic.  She is addicted to beauty for the sake of nothing other than to feed her addiction.  The evil in this story reminds of the satan as seen through the eyes of dervishes....Satan was so in love with god that he refused to bow before man....evil in this story is a human construct, very much understandable, if out of control.  And Snow white, well she is sublime....""you cannot have my heart"". understanding and forgiving.  resolute. "" who will be my brother""  and ""NO YOU CANNOT have my heart"" and she sheds a tear knowing that she is denying a pathetic creature a desperate need.  The music brings you to tears.

Here we see the true character of this sward-wielding princess with her insurmountable struggles against the magical powers of the evil monarch. The seven dwarfs are there, of course, but Dopey have morphed into a more serious version of himself. The prince in this adult version of the story changes too. He is now an Australian version of the conquering hero [sans the accent] with a greater roll in the film than just showing up at the end of the story to give our heroine a reviving smack on the lips. One new character shows up here, the wicked Queen's brother.... who, to no one's surprise, is the partner-in-crime of his bitchy sister.

4746574,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Like others, I wanted to like this movie; however.... I like a twist on a known tale, and I was happy with the premise.  The cinematography was good and the darkness appropriate, lending the movie a good grittiness. What really killed the movie for me was the acting. Kristen Stewart was Kristen Stewart - it didn't really add anything, but wasn't wholly distracting either. However, if you've seen any of the Twilight movies, it is exactly the same - same expressions, same delivery, except with a par English accent. Perhaps this isn't entirely her fault, as the character is similar - a girl finds herself a target and is helped by anyone and everyone to stay alive. I wish my thoughts of Charlize Theron's performance were as positive. I don't  dislike her, and think she's done well in some of her movies - though not this one. It was as if she had substantial problems with her English accent, so decided to speak. very. slowly. to. compensate. Perhaps it was meant to be more dramatic, but I found completely distracting. The men's acting saved this movie for me: Chris Hemsworth was good, and the cast of dwarves was outstanding: Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, etc.  And it's a shame we didn't see more of Willam (Sam Claflin).

The other niggle I had with this movie was the lack of originality in some parts. For me, the entire sequence of the group going to meet the duke was entirely too similar to the Lord of the Rings, down to the a cappella song accompanying the group walking along a cliff. Perhaps this was hard to avoid, considering the group was of similar size and make-up, but I think more effort could have been made to give it its own character - especially since they are looking to expand on this franchise.

Again, I didn't hate this movie, but I far from loved it. I didn't think I went in with many expectations -- I was hoping to really enjoy it. Unfortunately, that was not the case.",1350864000,2,1923,4.546242774566474

I honestly didn't have sky high expectations for this movie, so it wasn't a case of having them being too high to possibly be met (as can often be the case for fantasy/epic/action movies).  The first 20 minutes or so were compelling--I was intrigued, as were the people that were watching it with me [Note, I have only good things to say about the streaming quality--as always with Amazon it's great].

After the first 20 minutes it just seems like the story collapsed on itself under the weight of trying to ""reimagine"" the Snow White story.  There was very little meaningful chemistry between the actors, and after a while, the CG looked like it would have been decent for a mid-90's film.  All in all it ended up being enjoyable, but more because I and my friends were laughing at it.  So, it wasn't a total loss.

A brunette as Snow White?  Really?  Worse, a poor acting job by a brunette as Snow White.  Has she acted before?  Apparently but, you wouldn't know it by this performance.
And then along came... Thor?  I hope his financial advisers are better than his acting agents because, this role pretty well type casts him as Thor and he'll need his Thor money to get through life.  He acts like he's Thor, he looks like Thor on a bad hair day, and he seems uninterested in giving the role something other than what he had just completed on Thor and The Avengers movies.  Maybe he didn't get any sleep or maybe he was just unhappy because he hadn't had any time to spend any of his Thor money.
The Queen?  Charlize Theron best acting was when she was taken away as a child.  Oh, that's right, that wasn't Charlize playing the kidnapped young woman.
Rupert Sanders best directing job was when he told his aide to get him a coffee.  It's not evident he was even on set when any of the 3 stars were, what do they call that, acting.

4747173,1,B005LAIHSQ,This review is about the movie not about any sellers. Kristen Stewart is the worst actress ever I was soooo very excited to see the movie thinking possibly that her acting would be better than any of the Twilight films. She seriously ruined the movie I felt as if I were watching a different version of twilight. They need to remake the movie with a different actress!!,1350604800,7,369,4.522388059701493

4747175,1,B005LAIHSQ,"I rented this thankfully so not a whole lot was wasted but my time. Me and my kids watched this together one night and even my kids 11 and 9 year old girls were bored to tears.  This movie lacks all substance and if your looking for a real plot look elsewhere.  Huge waste of time, want to watch a fun fantasy movie go back to Princess Bride or the newer Stardust but whatever you do skip this!!!",1350518400,,396,4.064102564102564

4747177,4,B005LAIHSQ,"What an interesting twist on an established Fairy tale. If it's one thing I  have always been inpressed with is, originality, and for me this one hits the mark . However ,make no mistake this tale is not for children of a young age, it's dark and bruding at times. The acting is great and there are some outstanding spectacular visual effects. If I could tweek it a bit,I might just make it a bit shorter. To sum it up,I must say I really enjoyed it.",1350518400,,450,4.232558139534884
4747178,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I found Snow White and the Huntsman to be quite a surprise (I've only ever known the fairytale version).  The adult spin was clever and made even more intriguing with all the generated nuances throughout.  Well done, in my opinion.  Well done!

They took all the best bits to create the trailer, and that made the movie look like it was going to rock. It didn't. I considered this a huge letdown. I've always loved Theron's acting, but she was just this side of campy trying to fit into the fairytale genre.

This is a great movie if you're interested in the evolution and telling of fairy tales or if you just want to spend a couple hours in enchantment.

The ending left me in awe, wanting more but knowing that having it would ruin the effect. I just sat there watching and thinking about the movie afterward. Just wow. I highly recommend.",1350432000,,457,4.493975903614458

4747785,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Please be warned! This movie is NOT FOR CHILDREN! The PG-13 rating is no lie, here. There are images and themes in this movie that could easily give any sensitive adult nightmares. Here are some EXAMPLES of only a few of the scenes children would find deeply disturbing (as did I):  The evil queen tells her newly married husband, the king, of her hatred of men, who ""use women,"" just before she kills him on their honeymoon bed.  A few scenes later you watch as her brother kisses her shoulder as he and the queen hint at an incestuous relationship with each other. In order to preserve her beauty, the queen eats the hearts of an animal or bird of some sort, which you see cut open at her dinner table, as she digs the heart out and puts it in her mouth.  The queen pulls the heart out of one of her subjects after he attempts to assassinate her.  No child should ever be exposed to such horrors.  You can definitely cross this movie off your Christmas list!",1350345600,,960,4.340782122905028
4747786,4,B005LAIHSQ,I like the drama and sincerity of the acting. And I especially like that the Queen had a brother who was as equally evil and mean as the queen. The insecurity of the queen was actually bought on by how she was treated in the past and not because she was so insecure about her looks. It was a good story but just alittle unclear as to which guy Snow chooses in the end.,1350345600,,368,3.9864864864864864

4747791,3,B005LAIHSQ,"In past movies we have seen several different off takes form the original Snow White story. Each has its strengths. And as with Shakespeare each generation of contemporary actors have to try their hand at it. We have seen the cartoon version and even vicious witches and giant midget versions. This version displays the advances in CGI and loud noise between the dialogs forcing you to keep your finger on the volume control.

In this story we see Ravenna (Charlize Theron) was deprived as a child. Her mother told her that you can have everything if you just maintain your beauty. She strives to have it all by overcompensating and in the process a few people will have to be dispatched and others suffer their own depravation, oops deprivation.

Ravenna needs to obtain Snow White's heart to maintain that cute smirk. But for some reason Snow White (Kristen Stewart) prefers to keep her own heart right where it is and escapes with it to the black forest. Ravenna sends a forest savvy huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to bring back Snow White. Confronted with Snow's demise the huntsman becomes her ally in recovering her kingdom from its usurper.

We as viewers have to decide just whose side we are on. Even Snow feels sorry that she cannot share her heart.",1350259200,,1255,4.747706422018348
4747932,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I liked the movie, but charlize Theron really did not do well. Sometimes she did, but for the most part the role did not fit her. She was not convincing and she did not pull it off. It didn't suit her for some reason. Her english accent was terrible, and it would have been better that she spoke normally than do the accent badly. She is a fantastic actress, but this one was not her best. Overall the movie was very good, good action, acting, etc. I liked it, but not as much as I whished I had.",1350259200,,496,4.071428571428571

4747940,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I rented the movie just for a weekend night with nothing going on. It was probably worth the $3 I paid to rent, but I wouldn't have any desire to see it again. Chris Hemsworth obviously did a fantastic job. Everyone else is so-so. The queen was a little over the top, and everyone bashed on Kristen's performance as Snow White. I honestly did think she was all that bad. Definitely could have had more lines as the lead role, but nothing was bad about her acting. All in all an ok movie with nothing to do. Worth the $3 to rent",1350259200,,527,4.176470588235294
4747941,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Being an action and suspense fan, this movie didn't sooth my savage beast. It started with a bang but began to slow about midway. It became close to boring and the ending was not satisfying. The commercials for this film depicted scenes of treachery and blood lush which enticed me to see it. The film did not delivery. It was fun to watch for a while and worth the 4.99 rental from Amazon but I wouldn't see it again or add it to my library.",1350259200,,442,4.211764705882353
4748051,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Okay to rent if you have seen everything else. As Dorothy Parker once said about another actress, and which I will paraphrase and adapt,""Stewart runs the gamut of emotions from A to B."" She brought the rest of the movie down to her own deadpan level. There was almost zero chemistry between her and Hemsworth. Charlize Theron, as far as she was able to, added to the overall movie, but she can't do it alone.",1350259200,,408,4.453333333333333

4748053,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This was a great movie,Charlize Theron as the witch stepmother was just down right frighting. She deserves every award she wins for her acting skills, I fear for anyone with a stepmother like her. I hate the way the movie ended though, maybe they left it wide open like that to make room for the sequel. From the rumors they are not going to use Kristen Stewart, that would be a shame because I would like to see the battle between the Huntsman and William for Snow's heart.",1350259200,,474,4.3977272727272725

4748055,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I didn't realize Kristen Stewart acted this movie, It looked like she was sad, waiting for her vampire to arrive all the time.

A nice start for the story every one knows about, but failed to deliver with inconsistencies of the main character and the lack of acting.",1350259200,,266,4.541666666666667
4748056,1,B005LAIHSQ,"I was really looking forward to this movie. Love Charlize Theron and the advertising for the film made it look legendary. What a group of boring, horrible performances. I see many people reviewing this film say,""the special effects were fantastic. The actors didn't act but the movie was great."" Why would you want to watch a boring movie in which the actors display only slightly more animation than an ordinary person. Kristen Stewart has a grand total of maybe four facial expressions and does not always succeed in placing them in the right order. Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworth needs a trip to acting school, as his performance was also a snoozer. The seven dwarfs were not interesting in any way, except to wonder how in the hell they shrunk Bob Hoskins down to such a small size. The director is a first timer who was out of his depth with a story that required more complex writing and better character development. Save your money for better new releases like: The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which actually has a great cast, a funny story and a director who specializes in creating independent cinema.",1350259200,3,1103,4.780104712041885
4748057,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I didn't approach Snow White and the Huntsman with high expectations, and the movie did not disappoint. The visuals are interesting, and the previews provide a good impression of the dark atmosphere of the film. I think it really falls down in two areas: characters and plot. I didn't find any of the characters three dimensional enough to care about. It seemed like significant effort was put into making us understand the wicked queen, but I didn't find those efforts successful. The wicked queen's brother was a complete, disturbing mystery. The storyline was okay, and a lot happened during the film, but the plot meandered around without a whole lot of focus or intentionality. And at the end (no spoiler), there was an odd, dramatic pause that felt like it should mean something, but I have no idea what. Overall, an okay production that could have been better with more character development.",1350259200,,899,4.921052631578948

4748059,5,B005LAIHSQ,"As a fan of fairy tales and myths, the movie was an adult version of the story. This darker version was interesting and entertaining and I would recommend this to any fan who enjoyed the Snow White tale as a child.",1350259200,,214,4.2439024390243905
4748060,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I expected to really like this based on what others told me of this movie, however this was not the case. I love the ""idea"" of this movie but felt it was too dark (seriously disgusting at times). It seems there isn't a happy balance between this movie and Mirror Mirror (which is the absolute opposite of this movie), neither movie was satisfying.
  My biggest complaint about this movie was the lack of relationship development and communication. It was absolutely ridiculous. The huntsman kisses her thinking she will never live and then leaves. Right after he leaves she awakens and walks out of the castle as if nothing has happened and gives a speech about fighting the queen. No one ever asks how she awakened. Snow white and the Huntsman don't talk about it. It's maddening! She just came back to life for heavens sake!
  This last complaint is probably trivial. While I realize that people did not bathe much back then I still feel that if I kept waiting for them to take a bath the whole movie then it's probably too realistic. Their hygiene shouldn't be a distraction through out the entire movie.
  Seriously could have been a cool movie, but it fell short.",1350259200,,1168,4.645631067961165

Although not a Stewart fan for many reasons, I thought her portrayal of her character was very well done. Except for riding to battle in armor in which she looked cold and uncomfortable (and who wouldn't under the same circumstances) She came across as very believable to me. Watching the bonus features, I learned that she is NOT a horsewoman, so her acting in that very brief scene was also understandable. I also thought Mr. Hemsworth's acting was right on point for his character. In all, I really liked this movie. The other actors were well done, and believable, except perhaps for the brother, and even the Queen. I find characters who are so evil a bit hard to take, but then, that is just my personal opinion. The acting was well done in all cases.
Now, on to the movie itself.  I don't care for dark movies:  meaning, scenes done in pitch black lighting. I can't see anything! Why directors feel the need to make things completely dark, so that only in a movie theatre can they be seen is short sighted. Even at night with all the lights out, there are many details totally lost to the viewer due to this fact. Also, and this may be due to my age, I really wish that moviemakers would take into account that ""background"" music and noise should be just that: IN THE BACKGROUND!!! Most movies these days feel that emotional music scores and sounds not related to actual actors speaking should be louder than the actual dialog. WRONG! If I can't hear the actors lines, how am I to understand what is going on? In some of the bonus features, I actually HEARD the lines missed in the movie because sound was not a major distraction in those interviews.
So, except for some major problems with filmmakers, which has nothing to do with this movie specifically, this is a great movie to watch for general entertainment value. And that, for me, is the reason I watch movies: Entertainment. I don't watch to be `preached' to about social issues, or for the most part, to learn about history (although sometimes that is a benefit, since I realize movies that have historical background are usually full of inaccuracies, which I am also aware of, so that doesn't bother me).

4748359,1,B005LAIHSQ,"Another shining example of Hollywood attempting to improve on a classic story and falling short. This re-imagined Snow White is a complete failure.

Rupert Sanders first venture into feature directing provides viewers with a lackluster trip; more painful than visiting the dentist.

Despite a few beautiful locations, the film wasn't even visually stunning.

There is nothing within these characters that leads the audience into an emotional investment. If a character dies, one is left with a feeling of ""I guess they're not going to be in the sequel.""

Despite a good cast (for the most part), Sanders doesn't bring out their best. The performances are mediocre (with the exception of Stewart). Stewart on the other hand is mediocre in every way on her best days! Her beauty is quite plain; her voice is annoying; her acting style is awful. She was only successful in the Twilight series because her style is exactly as dull as how the character is written. Her performance in Zathura is identical to her performance in Twilight which is identical to her performance in Snow White. Her range is far to limited to carry a movie. Her accent changes throughout the movie, probably due to the filming schedule. It is more of an accent one picks up the longer they are around people with similar accents. Her acquired accent is beyond poor. Most likely due to regional differences in the shooting locations within England, plus Scotland, and adding in Chris Hemsworth natural Australian and Charlize Theron's South African accents. It's a bit of a hodge-podge accent. Stewart's rally cry to incite the people to stand against the queen completely lacks conviction and passion. It's almost as if she's calling out to some from the balcony of her home: ""brother, don't forget to pick up milk on the way home!"" It's unbearable!

Even my ""tween"" who loves Thor, and is a disturbingly huge fan of the Twilight movies, asked if we could turn it off and watch something else; she was that bored!

Overall, the final product leads one to believe that the Sanders/Stewart scandal was nothing more than a PR stunt to bring audiences to the theater!",1350000000,3,2135,4.900277008310249

4748502,3,B005LAIHSQ,"The original Snow White was a story told to relate the difference between innate and physical beauty in a woman. Kristen Stewart, though fairly good as the princess avenging her family and her kingdom from evil, misses one important element that makes Snow White who she is and that's joy. The whole weight of Snow White's beauty doesn't rest with her innocence or pretty face but with her inner joy, love of life and compassion. Stewart doesn't bring these elements to the role but remains dour through the entire film. The strength of a Snow White is that she can inspire love from all around her because she carries that happy lightness of being within, the fairy tale itself rests on the idea that a woman's beauty is in her innate qualities and attitude not her physical beauty; in short women cannot command love just because they are physically attractive. By contrast the performance of Charlize Theron as the queen is awesome. Theron balances everything perfectly and subtly portrays what drives the queens character. The queen symbolizes a woman who cannot love and so cannot be loved because of some grave hurt that has twisted her heart and her character, she's supposed to hate Snow White not just because she's pretty but because she's happy and loved. Theron shows a woman who is dependent on the power of physical beauty because she cannot exude it from inside. She feels used, hurt, lonely, angry and vengeful the opposite qualities that makes Snow White snow white which is why she's told by her magic mirror that if she takes the princesses heart she will live and remain beautiful forever. I would have given this four stars, maybe even five if the story was properly portrayed but it wasn't and I cannot tell if its the fault of the director or lack of emotional in Stewart herself.  As for those who felt the triangle between Snow White, the huntsman and William was left unresolved you are all mistaken. The idea is that the Queen's power over Snow White can only be broken through true love, when Prince william kisses her she remains dead, when the Huntsman kisses her she is restored, so we know from this that Snow White's heart rests with the huntsman and not William.",1350000000,,2196,4.71875

4748505,1,B005LAIHSQ,"If you have lots of time to kill and don't mind spend $3.99 on a mediocre movie, then don't read any further. Go ahead...with my blessing. Really.

But if you prefer intelligent cinema that at least tries to make a feeble stab at realism, read on.

Let's start with the premise: Snow White and the Huntsman is a modern remake  of the classic fairy tale. When you hear of this flick, you might immediately think of the happy-go-lucky, innocent Snow White of Disney fame and assume a 2012 version with awesome special effects might actually have a chance of being interesting. Well, you'd be wrong.

For the first fifteen minutes or so, I truly wanted to believe in this story, but the film let me down so far that by the end I was rolling on the floor in a mixture of agony and laughter.

The hints at Norse and Celtic cultures used in both the costumes and sets seemed promising. However, the production department just couldn't decide whether this ""Kingdom"" was in 14-century France or 8th-century Denmark. The result is a motley visual melee of boots, longbow archers, cleavage-baring dresses with feathers pasted on, and glistening armor that Lancelot himself would have envied.

When we first see Snow White, she's a miracle girl born to previously childless parents who can't be more pleased. Why shouldn't they? After all, they got exactly what they ordered--a beautiful, blue-eyed girl with red lips and shiny black hair. She's good, kind to animals and plays outdoors. Young Snow White (Raffey Cassidy) made a credibly beautiful, lively princess. Understandably, I had high hopes for the role of the older Snow White.

In keeping with the legend, Snow's mother bites the dust and her father is left suitably aggrieved. Because of his newfound emotions, he's goaded into battle with some mysterious soldiers in a forest. It turns out these soldiers have a `hostage'--Ravenna (Charlize Theron). He's so `fascinated' by her beauty that he doesn't think twice about her background and brings her to the castle straightaway, Trojan-horse style. After Snow's father has been duped into marrying the lissome blonde, at bedtime she hisses some very unladylike verbiage into his ear then stabs poor King Magnus to death. Evidently his crime was to feel desire for a beautiful woman, which according to the Fem Lit major Ravenna, is punishable by death. Hands off the merchandise!

The next segment is quite standard and tired--Ravenna steals the throne, kills all Magnus' nobles and slap Snow White into prison for looking too beautiful. Ravenna's dislike of men doesn't stop her from using her brother as her personal punching bag, either. Theron's performance is OK--with that deep sinister voice, she's maniacal, all right. But we scarcely get a glimpse at her vulnerable side, the side that must have kept her from killing Snow outright in the first place. That's partly due to a script flaw. Horror, pain, suffering, etc, under Queen Ravenna. Yawn.

Enter our languishing heroine (Kristen Stewart), who suffers an untold number of years in her lonely tower, watching lovely maidens have the youth sucked out of them by Snow's stepmother, all from a distance. With stringy black hair in a perpetual side-part and eyes that rarely open past half-drugged slits; ridiculous poufy sleeves and rather tomboyish leggings, Stewart's grungy Snow White is far from impressive. You're left asking--this is the fairest of them all? Right. You decide Ravenna really doesn't have that much to be worried about.

After mumbling the Lord's prayer (this is a Christian kingdom??) in tortuous English dialects and petting her straw dolls in the shape of her parents, Snow White decides she'd rather not have her youth sucked out, thank you very much. It's jailbreak time. Our innocent-turned-commando slashes her jailer with a rusty nail and flees the castle by executing a perfect softball slide into the underground sewer. Not the most romantic of escapes, but there you are.

After diving in to the ocean and avoiding being killed by rocks and surf, Snow White happens upon a horse awaiting her on the beach. (Guess the color of this horse---yep, white.) Interestingly, she has not forgotten how to ride during her long years of imprisonment, and lithely hops on and heads for the dark forest. On the way she rides straight into a bog, inhales a few magic mushrooms and eventually collapses in a writhing ball and passes out in what is commonly known as a side effect of consuming hallucinogenic fungi. Survival school rating: Fail.

But wait---we've forgotten the other title character. Dear old Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) is living is squalor, having no other defined skills except drinking and well...the other thing that comes after drinking. He likes to brawl, too, just like a good savage ought. Apparently he is also a tolerably good tracker--just the sort the queen needs. Ravenna's lap dog manages to douse the inebriated Huntsman in ice water and haul him before the royal presence, where he in informed he will have to retrieve the bad little escapee.

With the Huntsman's undefined prowess at work, it takes him approximately five seconds to track down Snow, implausibly overcoming a day's gap and miles between him and his quarry. Since the queen ticked him off by mentioning she could resurrect his dead wife as a form of payment, Huntsman suddenly decides he might not finish the job, after all.

It's clear that Hemsworth is still in the Thor frame of mind. He swings his axe with the same fervor as he did Mjolnir, expect the Hunstman's axe doesn't shoot lightning or send enemies flying hundreds of feet away. Either of the qualities might have helped the fellow actually win a bout.

Even deprived of his usual good-hygiene, Hemsworth is the first appealing character this viewer has seen for the entire film. At last she has a face to pair with the pointless voice-over narration. She can even excuse his attempt at a rather corrupted Scottish dialect and decided mad-on. Why? Because Hemsworth brings something to the screen Stewart can't--chemistry. Despite his best attempts, every romantic scene deadpans out because of Stewart's miserable delivery and lack of a softer side. I don't mean helpless female. I mean feminine. Snow White's mother wanted her daughter to be as delicate and as hardy as a winter rose. That's what Snow should have been, if she hadn't been too busy being caught between Amazon and peabrain.

When you take away Snow White's beauty, innocence, and kindness, what do you have left? Answer: a modern-day Boadicea, without the hard past and military skills to back it up. It's a pathetic substitution.
If I was a soldier waiting to receive orders from my leader, the last thing I'd want is a harridan in a white nightgown screeching about how excited I should be about assailing an impenetrable fortress. This Snow seems to place zero value on life, unless it's stroking a large stag (white again) beneath a tree covered with sprites. Then she gets to be upsets when some rude twit puts an arrow in it.

This stag, by the way, seemed to be an allusion to the Celtic god Herne, though of course no explanation of this factoid is given in the film. One is left to assume the director spent a good deal of time watching The Hooded Man, which would, incidentally, explain the presence of Ray Winstone in dwarven form. Actually, I found the dwarves the most enjoyable group because they could act.

I won't even go into the fallacies of the final battle scene that seemed ripped off from Robin Hood, except to point out that Snow, who proclaimed earlier not to hate Ravenna, comes in with sword a-swinging to deal the final blow.  And then, at her coronation, Snow doesn't even give as much as a nod of acknowledgement to the Huntsman. Most women under the age of dead would act like they've been struck by Cupid's Arrow after getting a kiss from that guy. They'd be inseparable. Together forever.  End of story. But all Snow can do is cry and gasp like a fish out of water. Graceful? I think not.

In my opinion, the Huntsman wins the Last Man Standing Award. He smiles tolerantly through Snow's screeching speech. He fights for Snow's life time and time again. He's clearly in need of a relationship. Therefore he deserves the hand of the queen if he wants it. But Hemsworth and the scriptwriter make it clear he doesn't.  It makes you want to knock some sense into Snow for dissing Huntsman for wishy-washy William.

That's why this story is all about Snow White. She had no fulfilled love interests, no friends and no future. Snow is worse that nave and impractical--she has no spine. If there ever was a waste of a good legend, it's this one. It could have been a grown-up version of the children's classic--sexy, powerful, emotionally charged. The perfect male lead was there. So was the funding, the CGI, and the scenery. Purely because of Kristen Stewart and a script as flimsy as her fighting skills, Snow White and the Huntsmen falls flat on its face and directly into a mud puddle.",1350000000,7,9022,4.863192182410423

The CGI and setting in that film worked with the picture.  In this film, some of the CGI was just bad.  The great white hart was awful, an affront to the lovers of Cernunos everywhere.

Snow White and the Huntsman  has an interesting story line.  Ms Theron did an interesting job on the evil queen but aside from getting to over emote in a few places the director never let her go.  I wanted to see more of the Monster passion from her.  The huntsman was equally constrained.  The actress who played Snow White did a better job when she was dead.  She should play a tree in the next Tolkien movie.  Loved the dwarves. The rest of the cast just did not have much to do other than reciting lines in a very dull way.

The day that came out I saw it immediately and the expectations of what could I find where not lost. Now when it came to the DVD and I found out that there was a extended version I had to buy it. I will NOT SPOILER the surprise so if you want it buy it.

Love it.",1349913600,,426,3.896551724137931
4748890,2,B005LAIHSQ,"First of all, when I saw the trailer in which the always terrible Kristen Stewart is more fair than Charlize Theron, I decided not to even watch the movie. I later caved in and unfortunately watched it. If someone had cut out panoramic pictures and screen sets from the movie, it would have been significantly shorter. Also, there were no emotional connections to any characters other than the evil queen and at times the huntsman. Overall, a very boring and anticlimactic version of this classic tale. Literally NOTHING exciting happens.",1349913600,2,538,4.988888888888889

4748892,5,B005LAIHSQ,"Went to the cinema to see this film and couldn't wait for the DVD to be released.  I was not disappointed and found it even better the second time around.  It reminded me a little of the TV series 'Merlin', very dark and mysterious.  The special effects are amazing and Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron are superbly cast.  This one is definitely NOT for the children - quite scary in places!",1349913600,,394,4.507042253521127

4748894,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This was a lot better than I thought it would be.  While I didn't like Kristen Stewart, like usual, I thought everyone else did an amazing job.  Charlize Theron was AMAZING! Not many people could have pulled off such a psychotic character so well.  It was so believable.  Also, I loved the story.  It wasn't just your basic Snow White tale.  It went further.  Plus, the dwarfs were adorable and heroic.

The only thing I didn't like was **SPOILER** in the end, you don't know who she chooses!  I have a feeling it was the Prince, because he's a Prince, but it definitely should have been the Huntsman.  Also, I didn't feel much love from Stewart in this movie.  She didn't do a very convincing job with either the Prince or Huntsman.

Anyway, I would recommend it :)",1349827200,,766,4.471014492753623

If your definition of ""good"" is some way of keeping you out of the heat of summer for two hours a success, then eureka... winner. The whole thing was a bloody mess. Melodramatic at its best, simply insipid the rest. I have seen Kristin Stewart in decent roles in her early career, but she is basically playing her bella character guised in the mythos of snow white. yeah she looks good, but that is about it. It all felt weak. I felt there could have been a better movie there, but it just stayed flat without much real inspection of the huntsman part, the only way to make this work and not turn it into a live action anti-disney film. If you want to watch charlize expose her back and see the cool television trailer in ""context"" spend your money, otherwise watch the trailer and move on.",1349827200,2,956,4.287292817679558

The whole movie felt like I was watching a college project to duplicate the Lord Of Rings movie feel as a class project or something. As a class project certainly it deserves an ""A"". As a production movie it is more of a ""C"".

4749227,5,B005LAIHSQ,"I was ecstatic when I first heard of this version.  After seeing it, I am a huge fan.  The well-written and acted drama/fantasy is carried by Theron and Stewart's performances.  Theron's queen is an evil but pitiful tragic character who emotes loathing and sympathy within minutes.  Her life is a sad one which has made her a man-hater, bitter, and cursed.  Stewart's Snow White is a young woman with a heart and a flame of hope.  She is not a wimp but not yet the warrior leader that she is destined to be.  The film looks bleak when it needs to be and colorful when hope springs up.  Overall, it is a grand adventure for the eyes and the soul.",1349827200,,645,4.316666666666666

I am sure there are other actresses who could have given a stronger perforamnce but the way this script was writtten, in my opinion, the story line was not about Snow White it was about the effects on the people after the Queen came to power, Snow White was a by product of those effects. Kristen may not have added anything extrodinary to the film but she really didn't detract from it either. Charlize was magnificent as always, and the special effects were awsome, and Chris well he is just a cutie!! Over all a pretty good movie.",1349827200,2,647,4.4

His fake Irish accent didn't go over too well, but his performance was excellent.  Another highlight for me was the seven dwarves.  I loved the new take on their life style, and the actors were very well chosen.  The only drawback for me was Kristen Stewart's acting.  I will say this in her favor, however, she did seem to put forth more effort in trying not to be so wooden.  But it is painfully obvious that she is trying.  I'm not sure if it's lack of confidence or what, but she always seems very unsure of herself.  I do hope that she is able in time to grow into a more mature and confident actress.

4749977,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Having seen several attempts to make the animated classic into a movie, I wasn't expecting much more than to enjoy the performances of the actors.  Happily, I found much to enjoy with this movie.  It is by far one of, if not the best version of Snow White I've seen.  The story was humanized in such a way as to give a good twist on the classic telling.  The characters displayed depth and complexity, and I was drawn in emotionally when I was not expecting to be.  This is a really good movie for the romantic at heart, because you will get a good story with great acting from Ms. Theron, Chris Hemsworth, and yes, even Kristen Stewart. Plus, there are good CGI effects, and plenty of fight scenes for the ""not so romantic"" at heart.

The four star rating I gave it is based on my own personal taste and nothing really against the movie itself.  I prefer movies that focus more on the characters, while I understand that with Snow White there is a built in restriction by having to tell the story itself.  I was definitely left feeling that more could have been done to develop some of the characters' points of view, but it did not stop me from enjoying the movie very much.

This was definitely very action-packed (guys would actually like it) but for us girls, a little more romance would have been nice.  The end was a little frustrating because it just left you hanging but I hear there may be a sequel.

4750153,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White and the Huntsman, while entertaining the acting was sub par. If it wasn't for the special effects this movie would have been a total bomb. The actress that played snow white does not carry the character very well. IN contrast the actress that plays the Queen does a very good job of making her character come to life. The Huntsman was well played and the supporting roles weren't bad. This movie is one to watch if you have nothing better else to do.",1349654400,,461,4.435294117647059

4750157,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Really, really interesting re-interpretation of the fairytale that brings out the violence of the original fairy tale while not dumbing the story, itself, down for today's movie audience of ADD kids.

The scenery and costumes are period correct, the fighting is believable and the magic effects and fantasy elements are superbly invented and do not at all look like the ""too clean"" CGI of some films. It is superbly acted with the exception of the, as usual, awful Kristen Stewart who again bitchfaces her way through a role looking as stuck-up and disinterested as she is in real life. Hemsworth is AMAZING as a man who has given up on life and finds something to fight for in the promise of restoring Snow White to the throne of her father. Charlize Theron gives depth and meaning to the character of the Evil Queen who, in this variation, married and murdered Snow White's father. The writers actually give Ravenna a post-feminist spin by making her a wronged woman whose mother is murdered by feudal lords.

THERE ARE DWARVES! They use the perspective trick from the Lord of the Rings movies to make it work. It's really a great story and WOULD have been a great movie if not for the horrible, horrible performance of Kristen Stewart.",1349654400,6,1238,4.753488372093023
4750158,2,B005LAIHSQ,"The movie starts off well, but clearly begins to lag as Kristen Stewart becomes the focal point.

The only actor of any caliber is Charlize Theron and it shows.  Kristin Stewart is wooden and Chris Hemsworth, while good in Thor, The Avengers, (and what little we saw him) and StarTrek does not pull it off here - he seems like he doesn't want to be here, like he's contractually obligated to act in the movie.

The visuals and audio were great in HD and it wasn't a waste of time - it was entertaining - but it could have been so much more.

In hindsight I'm not sure I would pay money to see it, but if it happened to come on cable TV on a rainy Saturday afternoon?  Sure.",1349654400,,716,3.9444444444444446

The animation was fantastic!",1349654400,,357,4.424242424242424
4750434,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I really enjoyed this version of the classic fairytale.  Charlize Theron gave a brilliant performance as the wicked queen.  If for nothing else, her acting alone is worth seeing this movie.  The other actors did good as well.  The cinematography and special effects were very well done.  As far as the storyline and directing, yes, it could have been better, but can't most movies of this genre?  This definitely is not for young children, and I would say that parents use their own discretion.",1349568000,,494,4.821428571428571
4750435,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Overall Snow White and the Huntsman is an average film, with good and bad mixed throughout.

Obviously the good has to start with Charlize Theron's Evil Queen Ravenna, which of all the ""main"" characters has the best character development and story arc for the entire film.  The makeup, special effects, and cinematography of the film are outstanding as seen in the aging of Ravenna throughout the film as well as the majority of the fight scenes throughout the film.

The bad has to start with both Snow White and the Huntsman, which turned out to be a waste of the acting talents of Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth.  Both title characters were lacking in terms of their individual character development and frankly their relationship to one another, especially the romantic one emphasized after the poison apple.  Going hand-in-hand with this underdevelopment is the all-over-the-place plot this film's plot has along unexplainable details (like the Dark Forest being evil that opposes Ravenna instead of being in league with her; the inclusion of James as another love interest that has a better romantic set up than with the Huntsman; the weird mixture of pagan and Christian elements that at first seem opposed than working together than totally forgotten; why Ravenna starts aging at the particular moment she does; and etc, etc, etc).

You might be asking why I began this review by calling this film average when I seem to have more bad than good.  Well this film has just enough to keep one entertained from beginning to end, however there was so much wasted potential that was either just missed or mishandled that if you start thinking about it then the film becomes a drag.  If I had been able to give this 2 1/2 stars I would have, but I couldn't go far enough to give this film 2 stars.",1349568000,,1803,4.7935483870967746

I don't know what problem the public seems to have with KS, but in my opinion she is very believable in this movie...Charlize Theron is great and omg Christ Hemsworth is the frosting in the cake ;-) The movie has action and romance.

However, in a culture where evil is misrepresented all to often as merely an alternative this film is refreshing. Evil is completely and obviously evil.

I found the movie to be quite a switch from the old cartoon versions but I'm sure that it was supposed to be. It was kinda dark and eerie. The acting was VERY good. I don't know that I would nominate ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" for any kind of awards as best movie of the year but I sat through it and I give it a good solid 4-star review for the acting, plot and special effects.

A heavy reliance upon CGI and DI was most likely pitched to compensate for weaknesses in story. What's most unfortunate is that because of the convenience of visual animation and the economy of filmless production, we're left with lazy filmaking. Regardless of the negatives, the perspective is fresh in trying to keep with traditional versions and I'll still keep it in my library along with the other variations. If it's any consolation, it was well shot, visually pleasing and the effects were pleasant. I killed a bowl of ramen noodlez and a PB&J sandwich, so it wasn't a total loss.

To be fair, Charlese Theron and Mr. Helmsworth were at their usual best, but were still not enough to make up for Kristen Stewart's usual depressing, monotone, unconvincing, amateur, pissy spoiled teen performance.

4751503,5,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie surprised us how good it was. Every character (except Snow White) is well developed. The story also tries to be epic, which I think it accomplishes on a small scale. If you like good fantasy movies (LOTR, etc.) you'll enjoy this. But you'll have to overlook Kristen Stewart as Snow White, as her acting and role is rather bad.",1349481600,,337,4.540983606557377
4751504,3,B005LAIHSQ,Maybe because I didn't have the whole affect of being in a theatre ornhaving an HD TV but Inthought this movie was boring. Effects were cool but that's about it.,1349481600,,161,4.4
4751505,3,B005LAIHSQ,The costumes and general look of the picture were nice.  The supporting cast performances were more notable than that of the principle cast. Overall the film did not live up to all the hype in my opinion.,1349481600,,204,4.513513513513513
4751506,3,B005LAIHSQ,This a dark turn even from original Snow White plots. Which I'm ok with but it was more graphic than I thought. Definitely for the more mature of 13 or older. I won't spoil anything else about this movie. Good actors. Dwarfs aren't really dwarf actors. Give the parts to the ones who fit the part,1349481600,,296,4.303571428571429
4751507,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Pretty weak performance from Kristen Stewart - seems like she was just playing Bella in another movie.  The special effects weren't bad, overall if it were a free movie, it is worth watching, but I would spend my money on it again.",1349481600,,231,4.5
4751688,2,B005LAIHSQ,"On the up side, the special effects were great.  Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth gave good performances, though Hemsworth was pushed into the background pretty quickly.

On the down side, Kristen Stewart got a lot of screen time.  This wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that she can't act her way out of a wet paper bag.  She has no emotion and is totally unconvincing.  Also, the writing was a little iffy.  It wasn't terrible, but it was obvious that the screenplay did not live up to the director's aspirations.

My expectations for this film were not that high to begin with, but it still failed to reach them.  If I had it to do over, I'd save my money and wait for this to come to Netflix or Amazon Prime for free.",1349481600,,732,4.330882352941177

4751690,2,B005LAIHSQ,Mirror...Mirror starring Julia Roberts was a much better movie.  Neither the Huntsman nor Snow were fully developed characters and didn't deserve their status on the marquee.  An imprisoned Snow White doesn't emerge as a warrior heroine but as a girl lost to her circumstances.  And who is the huntsman...an actor stuffed in a role for his looks because he cannot be the love interest of Snow White? This movie suffered from a case of reaching for too much while giving too little.,1349481600,,481,4.841463414634147
4751691,5,B005LAIHSQ,"I liked this movie very much. It mixed many well known and lesser known fables and fairy tales in an interesting and well thought out manner, creating a genre of its own making.

4751692,1,B005LAIHSQ,That chick cant act her way out of a bag....dialogue was horrible....boring movie overall. Expected more action then there was. Movie idea had potential but epic fail ensued.,1349481600,,174,5.25
4751693,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I was really interested in this film.  The previews looked awesome because of the special effects. They were amazing in this film!  I thought the Queen was the most interesting character.  Not only did Charlize Theron have the best evil queen wardrobe, she had a story of why she is the way she is and cannot escape it.  Kristin Stewart was good but it is true about her acting style - she has one facial expression for everything.  I'm not a fan of hers.  But I disregarded that because I like everyone else in the film.  Chris Hemsworth brings all his characters to life and really gets into character.  I also really loved the locations - it looked beautiful wherever it was filmed.  So overall the costumes, locations, and Theron/Hemsworth made the movie worth watching.  I thought it was a good take on yet another Snow White story.",1349481600,,837,4.594594594594595
4751694,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Charlize was great. She brought back memories of my phyco b**** from hell stepmother. That was worth a star. The story is a good one, the eye candy was ok too....

4751697,3,B005LAIHSQ,It was a dark movie about snow white. It was a lot more violent than I prefer in a movie. Guess it reflects the typical Hollywood movie mentality.,1349481600,,146,4.25

4751809,2,B005LAIHSQ,So this movie is better than a few other Snow White remakes that came out recently but that isn't saying much. The director obviously wanted Kristen Stewart for the Twilight popularity and a little something on the side (just Google it if you don't know). She isn't real believable in any movie I've seen her in and always seems constipated before she delivers her lines. For some reason Charlize Theron seems a little off here don't know why she is a great actress maybe it was the writing. But that said the rest of the actors are pretty good the dwarfs are awesome and the sets are done very well. So not the worst movie you could watch but certainly not a great one.,1349481600,,670,4.411290322580645
4751810,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I enjoyed the special effects. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth both gave great performances. The story felt like it was almost there but still did not quite cross the threshold to great. I did enjoy it and like the different spin. I do not know much about the story of snow white except what Disney and a few other productions have generated.

It is a good rental but I would not purchase it.",1349481600,,396,4.424657534246576
4751811,3,B005LAIHSQ,Not one I'd choose to see again. Poor dialogue with weak and obvious special effects telling the story in a way that seems formulaic.,1349481600,,133,4.583333333333333

4751813,2,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie is totally lame. It's use of fantasy was generic and inappropriate.

4751815,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I found this to be an excellent action/adventure/fantasy movie.  This version of the classic Snow White tale was well done with fantastic special effects, a great story line, and wonderful acting.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I found the ending to be somewhat of a letdown, albeit the logical place to end the story.  The ending just lacked the vibrancy of the rest of the film.",1349481600,,398,4.5
4751816,3,B005LAIHSQ,It was ok. I think the evil queen (played by Charlize Theron) was over the top in acting evil..and the end of the movie totally SUCKED. Could they not think of words for the end? They said absolutely nothing..BAD way to end. We need closure.,1349481600,,241,4.377777777777778
4751817,5,B005LAIHSQ,"The graphics in the movie are amazing, the acting, for the most part, is exemplary, and the action keeps you watching. The only thing that would have made it better is if, for the role of Snow White, they'd used an actress who could actually act instead of going with someone who's abilities are sub-par and was undoubtedly chosen solely on the hopes of attracting Twilight fans in order to increase ticket sales.",1349395200,,413,4.671232876712328

Again its an adult version of a kids classic so one can't expect to much or can you?",1349395200,,378,3.986842105263158
4751889,3,B005LAIHSQ,"The overall movie was alright.  There were definite portions that seemed to drag, most due to Kristen Stewart's acting skills but some scenes just lacked focus.

4751890,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I'm glad I didn't pay full price in a theater for this movie! The original story was good, why rewrite it? (and I'm not talking about the Disney version, I mean the ORIGINAL story)

Kristen Stewart was the wrong choice for this part. She cannot act very well at all and did not represent ""the fairest of them all"" as the mirror tells. In some scenes, her hair looked like a rats nest and she's always pouting.
 Some of the situations throughout the movie were unexplained and unrealistic. It seems Hollywood is relying more and more on the stars' names and special effects than a well thought out storyline. I won't give any spoilers but may be some clues to what I'm talking about:
Why isn't she dead already? An army comes and they bring a prisoner with them?? Seems everyone lives in a deadly forest? Why is it so deadly? and many more that would give away too much.
Charlize does a fine job of being wicked though!
Chris Hemsworth is good too but there is no closure in this film for his character.

I for one probably won't pay to watch the sequel unless Kristen isn't in it and I can watch it streaming.",1349395200,,1109,4.37378640776699

4751894,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This is a great twist on the old fairy tale with some great actors that seem to be out of their element in this movie.  The Wicked Queen played by Charlize Theron is on where a great actress has some very poor writing holding back her performance that could be so much more than what we see if the director had capitalized on the opening scene more and kept her moving throughout the movie.  The role of Snow White played by Kristen Stewart, is well developed and the visual effects that surrounds her journey are at times breathtaking to say the least, the only thing lacking here is a strong actress to play the role as in one scene riding on the beach she looks more like a wet puppy then the leader of a nation about to go to battle as she slogs through the surf.

All in all a great story, great visual effects, but some weak performances and really slow points hold this movie back from being on to keep your attention or you on the edge of your seat.",1349395200,,957,4.218579234972678

First the only snow white in the movie is the 1. Mirror 2. A Dead King 3. The Idea of a Stepmother who wants Snow White dead. That is it, no more, I do not understand why they simply didn't make something else, the fair princess who is in a total mess and everything around her will suffer till she meets 7 gnomes? yes not dwarfs and who apparently is followed by Thor who is lost in it's character and chased by a looney albino ???

Seriously WTH is this, not only the main character who was supposed to be Snow White who by definition , was as white as snow, hair as dark as night and have red lips as red as... and whose beauty surpassed everyone else even the ""queen"" ok that fails, the girls is not white, the hair is ok black the lips are idk what and she is not breathtaking.

The story then falls into LOTR then turns into fairy land and comes back to WTH... I mean really whoever wrote this was on something, then the persons who thought of the main characters and their roles, shared the something the first guys inhaled, and the casting person was clueless.

Over all go see Mirror Mirror it's dumb but at least funnier and entertaining.  whoever gave this movie 5 or 4 starts is entertained with plain crap.",1349308800,,1409,4.161764705882353

4752011,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I really wanted to like this movie, and I did like some of it.  The special effects were great, the character designs were wonderful, the backgrounds were spectacular.  The Acting was good, and the casting was decent.  But the plot, and the storyline itself.  There were just so many things that were left out, or rushed, or just plain made no sense, and so much was left unresolved.  So yeah, if you want eye candy, check it out.  If you actually want a well done spin on a classic...keep looking.  Personally I liked Snow White: A Tale of Terror.  Not great effects, but excellent acting, and a really well executed storyline.  No eye candy to speak of on either side though.",1349308800,,677,4.528925619834711

It started out interesting and then towards the end I couldn't stay interested. I wouldn't say it is a terrible terrible movie, it just didn't do the Snow white tale any justice. Not really worth a rental in my opinion. It's like hollywood just wanted to make a movie with the snow white title for recognition and then cast a few well known actors to make it worth your time. Then failed to deliver a great movie. Acting was a bit forced and weak. Well thats my opinion, don't get hurt.",1349308800,,624,4.3418803418803416

4752015,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White is a tough movie to retell to modern audiences.  Sometimes a movie can be completely ruined by trying to take it in a new direction.  This one turned out pretty good, for the most part.

It is far darker and sinister than any other version; there are parts that may give small children nightmares.  As a parent, I would be careful in showing this movie to kids younger than 10-12 years unless they are accustomed to scenes with black magic and violent combat.  The graphic scenes stop short of being gory, keeping the detailed effects of combat just out of the frame, but some of the scenes with magic being used are creepy.

The story was fantastic, giving the classic Snow White tale a fresh perspective with a couple of imaginative twists.  Chris Hemsworth (the huntsman) gives a good performance, falling short in a few areas (it was too easy to imagine Thor playing the part).  Kristen Stewart is just plain awful; she's just not a good actress and there are some scenes that are so poorly acted that I had take a star off based on her performance alone.  Fortunately, Charlize Theron is ridiculously good; she steals the show whenever she's on the screen--it's hard to take your eyes off her.

Overall, if you enjoy dark fantasy / fairy-tales then this movie is a good fit for you.  It's nothing like the original children's tale except for a few areas (like dwarves) but even those are shown in a very different light.",1349308800,,1436,4.592156862745098

The two swords of darkness and hope intersect for this fairy tale to feel real...and yet surreal.  All the magic is fantastical, but at times they go out of their way to explain how normal things can seem magical.  In many ways they wrap messages that help cut to the core of their reality.  Most interestingly, they come through with strong undertones that show the absurdity of the extreme feminist polarity by means of a female redeemer.  Overall, very well thought out and intriguing for entertainment and analysis.  However, the story did seemed a bit rushed at the end (thus 4 star).",1349136000,,711,4.739837398373984

4752489,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Although there are many variations of the Snow White fairy tale, this version strays quite far from all of them. A kernel of original story remains in this film but not by much. 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is not your kiddie fairy tale and parents need to be warned not to take little kids to this film. Some parents are very dense though. My local theater had to post warnings at the theater entrance that the movie was not for children. This version has been rewritten as an action adventure complete with haunted forests, a CGI troll, great battle scenes, and many many deaths. We even get to see Kristen Steward in a Joan of Arc getup. It is filmed with exqusitely beautiful scenery of the UK's Marloes Sands and a British coastline with a CGI castle added.

The film begins with an excellent revision of the beginning of the Snow White tale. King Magnus, widowed and in lonely pain, rescues a beautiful woman named Ravenna who is held prisoner by a supernatural army. He brings her back to his castle. Played by Charlize Theron, the viewer can sense that Ravenna is not as she seems. Snow White, the king's daughter senses this from the start. Ravenna cleans up real good, seduces the king, marries him and kills him on their wedding night. Ravenna and her army take over the kingdom and imprison the young Snow White in the tower.

'Snow White and the Huntsman' is a decent film even though much of the middle and end of the film feels somewhat forced. It is highlighted by great acting from a superb supporting cast; Charlize Theron in an other-the-top performance is excellent, Chris Hemsworth as the huntsman and Sam Claflin as Ravenna's brother are also both excellent. In fact the entire cast is very good except fot Kristen Stewart as Snow White. Stewart was a bad casting choice considering the other better actresses that were considered for the role. Her performance is flat and unconvincing.",1349136000,,1909,4.678571428571429

4752496,2,B005LAIHSQ,"and that's where the positives end.  I can only assume Charlize Theron owed someone a favor, or perhaps has crippling gambling debts.  Kristen Stewart is basically paid in this movie to stand and look at whomever is talking.  She's effectively a soundboard off which the other actors bounce their lines.  The only other positive is that this movie eventually ends.

The special effects are nice, and some of the bit characters are fun (if predictable), but overall I'd give this a 1.5 if I could manage to figure out fractional star-ing.  This movie is a great example of why a 10-point scale is needed.  Five-point scales don't provide enough granularity.",1349136000,,656,4.909090909090909

Apart from Charlize Theron's performance being exceptional all of the actors were forced to work with a sub-par plot and weak direction. There is little character direction and what seems like it could be an interesting angle between the huntsman, the prince, and snow white is quickly hurried past to move the action along.

Hopefully she will be able to purchase some acting lessons with what she made on this movie because breathing heavily and looking sad/confused all the time doesn't make the cut. Its really too bad because Charlize Theron was remarkable as the evil queen and it's a shame to cast a horrendous actress such as Stewart opposite Theron. The only value in watching this movie was that I can now, without a shadow of doubt, save money in the future by avoiding any film with Kristin Stewart in the credits.",1349049600,5,700,4.563492063492063

Meanwhile, the show belonged to Charlize Theron.  To paraphrase one of her lines, she was the queen that wretched world deserved. Terribly beautiful, miserable and bitter, hate-filled and constantly scanning for the fairest one who could break her power.  I really enjoyed this interpretation of the queen.

4752919,4,B005LAIHSQ,"When I heard that two Snow White movies were being released in one year my first thought was, ""Why?"" How many different ways can you tell this story without it being stale? What does the tale of Snow White, a domestic goddess, waiting patiently for her prince to come, while being a homemaker to seven little people, say to the 21st century girl, or woman, that's worth saying twice?

Rupert Sanders and his team of writers did an admirable job of proving that the tale can be told on a much grander scale as an allegory about good and evil. Snow White is not just a pure and charming princess who's waiting for her prince to come and rescue her. Forces in nature guide her to a means for escape, but she has to have the heart and gumption to use it. She is a Savior, with a capital ""S."" Her wicked stepmother, Queen Ravenna, is a demon and a plague that must be eliminated; although, she's just as much a victim of darker forces in the world as the inhabitants of the kingdom she usurped through a military coup and distinictly feminine trickery. This story is an epic tale of a heroine off to battle.

The cinematography is gorgeous and it seems that the director's intent is to remind you that despite the fact that he set this story in a dark and sinister, reality-based world, it's still a fantasy. His allusions to Princess Mononoke, Lord of the Rings, and even Star Wars (Ewok-style) is appreciated and places the audience firmly back in the right state of mind when the situations in which Snow White finds herself become downright depressing.

Then there is Kristen Stewart, who gets an entirely undeserved bad rap for her acting. She is brilliant, beautiful, and entirely believable as the embattled Snow White who just wants to get what's rightfully hers. She doesn't want to do it simply because she wants the power. During her journey, she and the audience gets to see emaciated inhabitants of a kingdom that flourished under her father's rule; dwarves who have lost their magic and been reduced to eight in numbers and living a shameful life; women with scarred faces to escape Ravenna's vampiric desire for beauty; and men gone and at war with an evil so powerful that their fight is an exercise in futility. Snow White is their only hope and she gives them her word that she can win the war. She'd rather die than to continue seeing people live in a dead world.

The religious symbolism is strong throughout - three drops of blood, possibly symbolic of the blood of Christ. Snow White comes onto the scene with a prayer and dolls of her father and mother held tightly to her chest - The Father and The Virgin Mary, perhaps. I think this movie was well-done with a few editing and pacing problems.

Charlize Theron's slightly over-the-top antics as the deranged queen is counterbalanced perfectly with Kristen's understated and consistent performance of determination and resolution to end her reign. They compliment each other well. Charlize's intimidating, deranged queen is exactly what is needed to convince the audience of the urgency of Snow White's journey to defeat her. The Prince, William, played by Sam Claflin is underutilized, but very effective, and his intentions surprisingly ambiguous in his small part. Chris Hemsworth's performance is heart-breaking, humorous, and soulful. Eight of some of the best English film and stage actors play the dwarves, from Bob Hoskins to Johnny Harris. They are funny, a little dark and twisted, and very necessary.

This movie ends smartly. Everybody knows that good will win. They didn't change the core of the canon story. However, some things are left uncertain and the weight of the reality of ruling a kingdom entirely alone after being imprisoned for ten years dances across her face. Once again, great acting from Kristen who in the end gives us a small smile. I won't say why. If not for the editing and pacing, I would give this movie five stars.",1349049600,,3920,4.7404692082111435
4752920,5,B005LAIHSQ,"This was a great movie because it took the basic premise of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" and changed it into a neat noir fantasy.  I thought the fact that the dwarves were well known actors like Ian McShane was interesting, because of the special effects they still looked like dwarves.  ALL of the special effects were very good, and in my opinion, Charlize Theron was perfect!  I'm not a fan of morose Kristen Stewart, but the movie was good enough that I was able to ignore her.  It was beautiful to watch, and fascinating enough to hold my interest, and I would recommend it to anyone.  I loved it, and will probably watch it again after a few months.",1349049600,,661,4.429752066115703

I was going to give the movie 4 stars (and not five) because Kristen Stewart did another EMO, lip-biting, damsel in distress role that we have all seen (and many do not love). What is the fixation with her? Prettier than Charlize Theron?  Really? That was my only complaint with the movie and that is not Amazon's fault - Amanda Seiyfreid would have been much better in the role, except for the fact that she just did the OTHER similar movie.

I'll try not to spoil any ""surprises"" in the movie.

The special effects were alright in my opinion. I'm not a huge action/adventure guru so I'm probably not the best at judging what makes amazing or terrible effects but some parts, like on the trailer when she turns into crows, were pretty neat.

My biggest bugaboo was Kristen Stewart. Luckily I never entered the Twilight craze, haven't read the books or seen the movie. What I do know is each movie I've watched with her in it is basically ruined by her nonperformance. They could replace her with a 2x4 wearing a wig and it would be the same effect. She has zero acting ability, it is like a younger, female William H. Macy.

The plot is nothing like the Disney movie, obvious before renting, which is why I wanted to rent it. The plot was pretty good, a little predictable, but most are. I do enjoy Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, both major draws to renting this movie. I found their acting a little short of what I have seen them in previously.

As with anything she's in, Kristen Stewart was flat, and kept the same ""I'm as empty-headed as a stump"" look throughout the entire movie.  Seriously, she's not anywhere near pretty enough to make up for her utter lack of acting ability, so why do they keep casting her in roles?  Charlize Theron (as usual) nails her role, and you wind up seriously disliking her (as you're supposed to do).  Chris Hemsworth delivered a decent performance, but IMO no where near the quality of the work he did in Thor or The avengers.  Surprising cast of cameo actors thought, that part was nice.

4753195,4,B005LAIHSQ,"You no doubt have read the other reviews; in the end, one needs to form their own opinion.  I found the tale striking in it's contrast to the fairy tale in that it has a 21Century bent, more up to date with current events:  the quest for ""power"" and control.  It is interesting that deep within the human condition there is the longing for the ""enchanted land"" of impossible things of enduring beauty and magic; it is the ember called ""Hope"", which strikes a chord for many.

There is one scene where Chris (Huntsman) looks upon Snow White in her death sleep and for an instant there is the magic of the story in his eyes, a memory that is the window of his soul.

There are a number of young, attractive women in Hollywood today who can act: Kristen Stewart is not one of them.  She and Robert Pattinson should get married, take the fortunes they made doing the Twilight movies and spare us anymore pathetic efforts at acting.  Casting directors should help them make this decision.

Charlize Theron is too good an actress to have squandered her energy on this movie.  Watching this movie was a total waste of time. My advice is to re-watch The Lord of the Rings which this movie tried to emulate to no avail.",1348876800,2,762,4.684210526315789

4753448,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Since it was a yucky evening outside, I decided to rent Snow White and the Huntsman from Amazon. I have to admit that I had serious reservations about devoting time to watch this movie. I am NOT a fan of Kristin Stewart. But, I figured that Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron would make up for what Kristin Stewart lacked in acting.

I will start this review off by saying that I'm a huge fan of Chris Hemsworth. I enjoy watching the movies that he's in and I personally don't feel like his acting is bad. Throughout this movie, I feel like Chris Hemsworth gave some very good performances. He really put his all into the character and I feel like the movie could have really excelled with him as the protagonist. Plus, he's smoking hot. I think more screen time for him can only improve this movie.

Review below/Some very slight spoilers

The Good:

The scenery in this movie was gorgeous. There were lush forests that were green and verdant...teeming with fairy life and make believe creatures. There were other places that were dark and dangerous. I loved how the dark forest was actually dangerous! Instead of just a dead acre of trees. I could watch this movie again just for all the wonderful scenery.

Next, I would give the world building a low grade. When it comes to the queen and the castle, I don't understand why no force was able to destroy it. The end of this movie was really lackluster and makes the viewer pretty confused with the easy victory. I feel like the village of woman was a fantastic concept and made perfect sense within this world. But, if your figure in this village and the fact that the queen was stealing the youth from all the young women in the surrounding villages...Snow White is the only pretty girl left in the entire Kingdom. She's basically the fairest of them all by default.

Charlize Theron was such a fantastic actress. She really out shown all her costars in this film with the sheer brilliance of her talent. Her back story is briefly highlighted but, helped to add some additional depth to her character. I would have liked have understood a bit more about the relationship she and her brother had. Is he with her by choice? I couldn't really tell.

Seriously, just watch this movie for Charlize and Chris Hemsworth. Speaking of Chris Hemsworth, I really wanted to give him a hug throughout this movie. Poor guy...

The Bad:

I really don't want to hate on Kristin Stewart a lot in my review. But, she doesn't have a large range of emotions when acting and I feel that this really takes away from crucial scenes. Another actress should have been chosen for this role.

Wow, this movie had a LOT of plot holes. I usually don't even notice this stuff and it became really distracting for me.",1348876800,2,2740,4.562118126272912

4753454,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie is much better than I expected. I went in with very low expectations, particularly because of Kristen Stewart's involvement.

4753576,1,B005LAIHSQ,"I had fun reading a few of the reviews just now, because others are really getting the same things I got from this poor excuse for a movie! I too have avoided ANYTHING Twilight, and especially Kristin Stewart, but also like others, the pretty kick ass trailer made me decide to give it-and Stewart- a chance.

Big mistake.

My favorite part was at the very end, when walking out of the theater, hearing all the other people making fun of the exact same flaws I had seen. I agree, Theron was very cool, and I wanted to like Hemsworth even more than I could, because yes- he was given a part far beneath his talents.

But back to the *star* of the show. Cardboard cutout with a pretty face! Oh yes. Seriously, did anyone else notice the 99.9% of the time that her character's mouth hung partly open-I'm assuming in what was supposed to resemble a sexy pout-to me it came off more like a dog that is too hot in the summer. And also...the chest heaving...really? I kept expecting the poor pale princess to go into an asthmatic attack throughout the film.

I was disappointed in the ""kiss"" scene; I understand (sort of) why they did it that way, but I had really hoped to see an exceptionally rousing, possibly romantic scene that was powerful and emotional. Instead we get kiss. Leave. Chest begins to heave. Mouth pops open and the dead rises.

And finally, our theater too was full of laughter at the princess' ""rousing"" speech. I was laughing pretty hard, because it was such an epic failure! I was thinking, and could imagine the Huntsman thinking it too ""Yeah we get it already-and the only reason we're listening to you is because you 'rose' from the dead. You're welcome btw..."" I just wanted her to shut up so we could see everyone else fight.

I think the final scene was a perfect picture encompassing not only the movie in it's entirety, but also Kristin Stewart's acting career. She is seated on a throne that no watcher (myself & obviously a few others at least) felt like she deserved...Now we get to zoom in on that pretty-albeit slightly blank-face....oh look!

Miscast. Lots of overacting and exaggeration that made the entire story seem artificial. Stewart was probably cast as a ""Twilight"" marketing look effect.
Seen any of these stereotyped, non-creative, Hollywood fantasy before?
(1.) Medieval women who have lots of eye liner; manicured eye brows; lipstick; men and women with braided hair. All Hollywood.
(2.) Horses with lots of armor including face masks. Hollywood.
(3.) Dialogue such as ""She is of the blood."" or ""We mean you no harm!"" Inane, give me a break - Hollywood.
(4.) Lots of big fat candles (weren't being made then) that look like they were bought at Target or Wal-Mart. Lots of big flaming bonfires. Hollywood.
(5.) Hero tames some wild beast by just being nice to it. Wild beast has the current rage CGI effect of piranha teeth. Hollywood.
(6.) Hero jumps on and rides a wild horse (without a saddle, even) like a pro even though she's just spent the overwhelming part of her young life enclosed in a small prison cell. Another white horse. Hollywood.
(7.) Fairies, rabbits, butterflies and mushrooms. White reindeer with big antlers standing next to big tree and water.  Hollywood non-creative borrowing on the verge of idea theft.
(8.) Sing along, fireside camping of Snow & dwarves. Artificial e.g.no insects to be found. Hollywood.
(9.) All the fake synthetic leather clothing that looks like a came out of the prop room from previous similar fantasy period movies.
(10.) The now decades old CGI of things being killed then turning into ashes, in this case little broken pieces, when being struck. The now cheap and getting old CGI morphing software.",1348790400,4,1629,4.988970588235294

Then, abruptly...the background music would blare forth and sound effects would completely overwhelm me.

At one point, my husband came running into the room, thinking that something horrible had happened in our living room. Why? Because the volume of the special effects had suddenly awaken him in the other end of our home. He was afraid that I had been hurt (only my ears).

4753640,2,B005LAIHSQ,"The only thing that is enjoyable about this movie is Charlize Theron.  Obviously, the story is not going to be a surprise, so it has to be the acting that makes it interesting and she's the only one who seems to have put any effort into this.  She's over the top at times but mostly, she makes a pretty good evil queen.  I was even a little inclined to be a little sympathetic towards her character during the wedding scene when Snow White stole her thunder - every bride wants to be the center of attention on her wedding day.
I like Chris Hemsworth.  He's eye candy, but also a fairly decent actor, so he's enjoyable to watch.  But in this he looked like one of the Geico cavemen - how did they manage to do that to Thor, for pete's sake?  So distracting, I couldn't take him seriously.
And then there's Kristen Stewart, who can't act for toffee and who has such an unexpressive face that she mostly just pouts her way through the movies she's in.  The scene at the beginning of the big battle finale?  Up rides the huntsman (the love of her life, we have just discovered, no Prince Charming here) and she winces at him.  She's supposed to be bursting with joy, overflowing with love and gratitude that he is there, they will face this together, all will be well if you are with me - you get the idea - and she manages to look like the laxative has just kicked in.
She's the female version of Tom Cruise - wooden acting, no depth to their performances, couldn't act their way out of a paper bag ... and yet Hollywood loves them.  I don't get it.
The rest was pretty much forgettable - I watched this a couple of weeks ago and truly can't remember anything else good or bad.",1348704000,,1675,4.272151898734177

4753643,5,B005LAIHSQ,"I have to admit at first I only wanted to see this movie because Theron was there, she always does a great job with her characters and her portrayal of the evil queen did not dissapoint. Her acting was excellent and her Evil Queen is the best rendition I have seen so far. Chris did a really good job with the Huntsman and was a very relatable character which is why I understand their reasoning to continue the franchise expanding his character. I did not expect anything from Stewart as Im not a fan of her performances in the past however, I was surprised that at times she actually did show emotion in some scenes (she actually smiled here an there, I attribute that to her imagining Chris in his Thor costume while in scene). The story is quite interesting, there were some unnecessary characters in play that really did not add much value to the movie, Im speaking of Sam Clafin(trying to keep it spoiler free so Im being as vague as possible).

Overall it is a good movie, it can be kind of long so you want to make sure you are up for a longer movie before you sit by it but it was very fun to me even with Stewart and Clafin playing some of the major roles. Parent warning, the Theron does a really good evil witch (as I already mentioned) which might be too scary for younger audiences.",1348617600,,1296,4.311475409836065

4753748,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Let's begin with the highlights -
Chris Hemsworth is a good actor and he does a great job with what he was given. He is able to do humor, drama, and he even brought a tear to my eye at one point.

The cinematography is amazing - it was so good so as to make Kristen Stewart seem like she was doing a good job acting (at times).

The lowlights - I really wanted Kristen Stewart to convince me that despite her lethargic Twilight acting, she is amazing. Alas, she really is not. She and Hemsworth are supposed to have flames shooting between them (or at least sparks), this should have been easy since - Uh, hello it is Chris Hemsworth we're talking about here - instead she looked at him like one might look at a brother. She just did not live up to the previews or the script.

As for Charlzie Theron, she cannot do a British accent to save her life and she came across as a deranged psychopath rather than a scary stepmother type. But then again that may have been what she was going for.

Overall worth the watch because despite the issues that I, and other reviewers, have indicated, up until the end it's a good movie. Actually if you stop the movie just as Stewart eats the apple you'll have seen all that's worth seeing, well except for Hemsworth doing a nice solo act in which he brought a tear to my eye.",1348531200,,1312,4.236
4753749,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Look, I get it. Everyone wants to do a ""New Vision"" of a classic tale. I tend to cut stories like these a lot of slack, because imagination should be rewarded, and often is rewarding to experience. Not in this case, though.

The best that can be said for this movie is that I don't feel like I wasted my time having watched it. It was mildly entertaining... every once in awhile. The main problem I had was that the story takes very broad strokes and seems to centralize on explaining plot points that do little to enrich the viewers experience and do almost nothing with the points that would have added depth to the tale. It also had at least an hour of film that rightly should have been excluded since it did nothing but bog the story down.

However, the weakness in the story could have been salvaged if Kristen Stewart hadn't been cast in the lead. Now, don't get me wrong: I think she's a wonderful actress. She put on a VERY good performance in ""Adventureland"". Granted, the movie really kinda sucked, but her role was very convincingly played, and she gets credit in my book for that. However, Kristen needs to play to her strengths... which, ironically, is her ability to portray a vulnerable and weak character. Hated ""Twilight"" and the franchise it spawned, but after having read the first book, I have to hand it to her: She played the part exceedingly well. Charlize Theron can portray the full gamut, from ultra strong to pityingly weak, but Kristen either doesn't have the chops or hasn't tapped into that part of her personality in order to give a convincing performance. The Snow White in this movie needed to run the range along with Theron, and Kristen was not up to the task, and the movie suffered as a result.

I debated on giving it 1 star instead of 2, and in the end I decided that 2 stars was more fair. It was a decent attempt, and the other performances, while not Oscar worthy, were at least par for the course (Except Sam Spruell: That dude should never be given more than two lines in ANY movie, and no line over 5 syllables). The storytelling was meandering even at the best of times, and no one seemed to really WANT to be there, but the cinematography was very well done, a few new elements to the classic tale were well received, and while this is not going to be on my Christmas bluray list, I can appriciate the movie for what it truly is: A fair attempt at an original vision of a classic tale.",1348444800,2,2433,4.414253897550111
4753750,4,B005LAIHSQ,"It wasn't terrible.  I guess I just expected more.  I was quite disappointed with the ending though.  Why is it that Snow White doesnt end up with the Huntsman?

4753751,4,B005LAIHSQ,"My family and I enjoyed this film. We are not huge fans of nor dislike any actors in the film so I cannot comment on anyone's performance. What I will say is that this film effectively and interestingly told a story by taking you through the adventure of Snow White's escape and defeat of the evil queen. I have read other's reviews and I get a real sense that people were wanting more substance in this film but I believe the substance was already there. It was present in the very fact that this is a well-known story. Most of us are quite familiar with the tale and didn't need to have every nuance explained, re-invented and/or re-interpreted. This story showed more of the evil queen's side and even hinted to the audience a back-story as to why she is so evil and powerful. That direction usually gets left out in things I've seen previously. It would be great to see a prequel at some point just about the queen and the events that led her to live such a scorned life.",1348444800,2,975,4.362637362637362

4753754,4,B005LAIHSQ,"For starters, this isn't your typical happy Disney romp that you and the kids can enjoy (that is the Julia Robert's Mirror Mirror movie). Charlize Theron is the mega star actress in this movie. Even Chris Hemsworth shines as well. Kirstin Stewart is a frail manniquen as always... and she's the focal point of two feuding factions. Most of the time she's running from danger and toward the end she's caught between a wicked army and the rebels that rise against them. If only one faction were werewolf and the other vampire...

It is funny how the name of the movie is Snow White and the Huntsman when it is really about the Wicked Queen / step mother of Snow White as she sends her men after Snow White. Charlize is on screen more than half the movie, which is a good thing, since she can act and even some super hero movies spend more time on the villain than the hero.

The Wicked Queen searches for a way to stay magically young by absorbing the youth from fair maidens. She quickly takes over as queen after killing Snow White's father. Then she locks Snow White in a tower for a decade before the magic mirror tells her that she can stay eternally young by absorbing Snow White's youth. You'd think that would be the first soul she'd go after instead of going through the trouble to keep her for a decade... but whatever. Eventually she escapes and the queen sends her men and the Huntsman after her into an erie swamp.

The sets and atmosphere stand out and someone spent a lot of time on them to make the movie feel different. This is not a happy world Snow White lives in. Everything is dead, dirty, creepy, black and wicked. There is still a happy magical setting in the middle of the movie that shines through all of the intentional ugly. With all of the creative settings, it does help keep the movie fresh.

There is some good action, but this is still an adventure that will take you on a long journey even if it is not Disney's happy journey. There is plenty of magic and cool special effects, but some effects are overused like people shattering into things. Maybe they got a discount.",1348444800,,2101,4.435233160621761
4753755,2,B005LAIHSQ,"The first hour of the movie was pretty solid. Visually great, story setup well, acting was solid as well (except for the two main characters). But for some reason the story went from being dark to horrible. The only saving grace was the solid acting done by nearly the whole cast. I don't blame Kristen Stewart, because there was scenes that she did well, I blame the writing. Like I said after the first hour the movie it becomes just a joke. Theron was good, but even her scenes seemed awkward and childish by the end. It is almost like the director said, ""Okay I think we have the kids nice and scared, the parents are hooked so now we can give them the same old story but with some little twists along the way to finish it."" Seriously? Even the seven dwarves were something unique and great to watch, until she bites the apple. Basically right there the movie needs to be turned off and you need to create your own ending. Just horrible after that. So watch the movie until she bites the apple and you may be able to ignore some the problems that plauged this movie prior to that moment.",1348444800,,1091,4.352941176470588

The two lead female roles were horrifically miscast.  I couldn't buy either one of them. Charlize Theron especially grated my spine with her feigned anger and evil infections. There was nothing sly or wily about her. The character was just too superficial.  She just couldn't pull it off. I also didn't like her face for the part.  She doesn't have an evil face at all.  I'd sure would like to have seen a beautiful, sexy and sleazy woman for that part.  She looks too much like a woman you would proudly take home to dear ol' mother.  As for Kristen Stewart, she could not muster up an emotional expression to save her soul.  She especially looked out of place on a horse.  She had no idea what sort of emotion to convey.

WATCH IT FIRST , AND THEN DECIDE IF TO PURCHASE OR NOT

TO MY OPINION: THE NATURE SCEENS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT IMPRESSIVE AND BEAUTIFUL

POOR ACTING !

VERY BAD ENDING TO MY OPINION

THE MOVIE SHOULD ALSO HAVE MUCH MORE ROMANCE SCEENS AND FEELINGS , EMOTIONS , BUT IT'S NOT !

THE SEVEN DAWRF - RIDICULES ! A JOKE !

WHEN I WATCH A MOVIE , I WOULD EXPECT IN THE END TO FEEL - WOW .. IT WAS IMPRESSIVE ..
BUT NOT THIS ONE!
IT MAYBE START GOOD , AND THEN - GOING DOWN

IN A WAY , I THINK I CAN COMPARE IT TO END OF THE MOVIE - THE EAGLE - WHICH ALSO HAS A BAD ENDING, AND ALSO WAS MADE BY UNIVERSAL STUDIO'S !

IN FACT, BECAUSE OF THE BAD ENDING I AM NOT GOING TO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE !

If we do not laugh, cry, get excited, as we watch the film, so what's the point ?

Granted, her performance wasn't nearly as good as The Evil Queen, but it wasn't so bad to keep me from watching again.  It isn't the best movie I've ever seen, but defn isn't the worst (the Immortals would be).

I liked the story, it was kinda dark. but, i loved how much time the film devoted to the queen, IMO she made the movie, talk about a bad mamagama... It is a little long and some of the Snow Whites scenes didn't make sense (like what was up with that moose and some of the forest shots) and it didn't stay true to original story (at least what I remember of the original story line) but, it didn't completely botch it either.....

I would defn recommend viewing however, it isn't for the kids.... A little too much fighting and it may seem a little creepy with the black magic and the queen showing just how evil she is...",1348272000,,1107,4.247619047619048

The huntsman, hot, macho guy yet sensitive on the inside. The brother of the queen and everyone else is great. Can't recommend this movie more!

Kristen Stewart proves yet again you don't need acting talent in Hollywood to succeed, just a half-way pretty face and a really horrible franchise that appeals to a niche audience, a highly publicized romance followed by a movie by a director who probably cast her for his own um, reasons.

The movie is saved by the amazing special effects, great acting by the rest of the cast and, once again, a stellar performance by a true actress, Charlize Theron. The very idea Stewart could be ""fairer"" than the most beautiful woman in Hollywood, made the entire plot less enjoyable. To truly have made the story line believable, they should have cast another actress in the role of the Evil Queen. Or at least given us a more believable Snow White. Stewart was cast for the public appeal factor. But for those of us who are adults and hate the Twilight movies, she ruined the full enjoyment.

There was little to no chemistry between Snow White and the Huntsman. Also, there was no reason for her not to fall for William. He was a great character, brave, loyal, handsome, had been fighting the queen his whole life and was clearly more suitable to be King. The Huntsman, on the other hand, was a man who ""escaped"" into alcohol, stood by and did nothing but brawl and owe other people money while the kingdom went to Hell in a hand-basket, and had no moral compass. Obviously an attempt to recreate the so-called ""Love Triangle"" in the Twilight series. His ""bad-boy"" persona was Cookie Cutter perfect with no thought or creativity put into  the character.

Not a bad movie, all together, and good, mindless entertainment for a few hours. But if you're truly interested in watching, don't pay to rent it. Wait for it on Amazon Prime or Netflix.",1348272000,9,1817,4.630434782608695

So low that at moments with dialogue and sound effects you either couldn't hear the dialogue or your sound is turned up too high for the sound effects.

So for watching a fun, fresh take on a classic story I'd give it 4 stars (cant be helped.  It has Kristen Stewart in it).  For audio quality, I give it a 1.  In all fairness, it did have sound.",1348185600,,689,4.328125

4754152,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White is a film I didn't see in theaters. It's not that fairy tale films don't appeal to me, its just that I didn't want to watch a film about Kristen Stewart. I was completely wrong, I should have given this film a chance because now that I've seen it at home I think it's FANTASTIC!

Albeit, there are problems but the film really works where it needs to. This is not the story of Snow White, this is the story that surrounds Snow White. It really should have been called The Queen and the Huntsman, or Snow White and the Queen... because in either case, the Queen, played to perfection by the gorgeous Cherlize Theron, is the real, central figure to this film.

Snow White and the Huntsman begins with the typical telling of Snow White. Snow's real mother is walking in the snow, pricks her finger and three drops of blood fall to the ground while she imagines having a baby. I would expect visuals like this so it starts off pretty well. As it flows we get into the awesome scenes with Cherlize... I mean the Queen.

Snow's mother dies and soon after a ferocious army of orc-like creatures attacks the Kingdom. Snow's father, the King, defends his Kingdom and easily defeats the army of warriors that cracks to pieces when hit by swords. Okay.... After the army's defeat the King finds a beautiful woman locked up in a wagon and immediately falls in love with her. IMMEDIATELY marries her the next day because.... she is a witch! Using her beauty as a spell to lure powerful men to herself, it's Cherlize Theron taking over the Kingdom! There is a beautiful marriage scene and then, before you know it, Cherlize, now the Queen, kills the King, murders anyone who stands in her way (really, the imagery is not for kids) and with the help of her strangely obvious, perverted brother, takes the Kingdom.

From this point on the film is just short of amazing. We see the young Snow White as a now youthful Kristen Stewart and the film chooses to keep her dialogue to a sweet minimum (good choice). When she does speak, its useful and not annoying. We see the stark difference between the evil, beauty stealing Queen (she sucks the beauty out of any woman, not the YOUTH, but the beauty. If you're an ugly gal, you're pretty much safe from the Queen) and the beautiful, genuine innocence of Snow White. Snow White, locked in a tower (and it looks rough, really) is praying the Our Father in a hushed whispering tone and I'm simply blown away. Not many producers or directors would show a character praying these days. It was really refreshing and really set the tone of the film.

The film tackles all the Snow White tent poles while giving us amazing imagery from the evil Queen and her just as evil brother without messing with the crux of the Snow White story. Hemsworth as the impossibly handsome Huntsman is a good addition to the story, and the impossible situation that brings the Huntsman and Snow White together is not toyed with as in usual Hollywood films... they know they are in a bad situation and do not use humor to break the mood. The Prince of the story, the son of a Duke fighting the Queen, is actually just as amazing as the rest of the characters. He is a fighter, a kind of Emo Legolas who can actually walk the walk.

The film does have problems, most notably the large cast of characters gives almost no time for the seven dwarves to have good development and they almost seemed like an unneeded addition to the story... which is weird, since it used to be Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.

Several moments seemed rushed (the aftermath of the infamous, spell breaking Kiss wasn't very climatic for me) and the romance was really left up in the air (bummer for Huntsman).

However, the Queen with all her evil awesomeness, her amazing outfits, her flawless performance and even sympathetic life is really the heart of this story. And its worth a good watch.

I really enjoyed it, despite the recent news of the actors bad life decisions which kind of hurt the movies reputation I think.

Kristen Stewart is really alright in this film. Not exactly the greatest but she pulls off the innocence remarkably well. One or two of the dwarves will knock your socks off, Hemsworth is amazing, as always. Cherlize Theron steals the show, but all in all, Snow White and the Huntsman is a good ride.

Give it a shot and enjoy it! I recommend popcorn because this film is a lot of fun. Four out of five stars.",1348099200,,4426,4.506234413965087

I would watch it again but only with the mute button on and if we can skip Stewart's classic and always there ""oh no.  What should I do?"" face.  Even when she rides to battle and is supposed to be a strong heroine, she has her ""I'm conflicted"" face on.  I think I may hate her as the heroine even more than the script.

The dwarfs were awesome, and the close ups of Kristen Stewart's Snow White were beautiful, but she was given very little dialogue. Charlize Theron's Queen was good as well, but she over acted in a couple of scenes.  Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman was just the right amount of gruff, but I was looking for more from his character, to show Snow White more moves on how to defend herself.  Sam Claflin's Prince was very good as well.  All in all, I enjoyed the movie so much that I purchased the DVD to add to my family's collection.",1348099200,,730,4.5

A good story, like Snow White, gets told again and again. When the story is so familiar, the unique character of each retelling really comes through. In this case, the best features are the effects and Charlize Theron's wicked stepmother.

The effects are everything you could hope, given current movie-making technology, and really have to be seen. Theron does an outstanding job as the evil queen, though - she convincingly projects psychpathic malice, despite her physical beauty and with no redeeming hint of human warmth. Perhaps it's no surprise that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prometheus/dp/B005LAIHY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prometheus</a>&nbsp;was in theaters about the same time as Snow White, and Theron played a similar character: never a hair out of place, but inhuman in dedication to her goals. Really, she made the movie. Except for the fact that Snow White got promoted from wimpy maiden in need of saving, the other roles didn't rise to that level.

Fun popcorn flick, beautifully put together, but (excpet for Theron), forgettable.

4754196,3,B005LAIHSQ,"As much as I love the whole bad-ass Snow White approach, there was little done in the script to make her seem believable as a virginal, beautiful and innocent Snow White. So with the small amount of character development seen on the screen, it is really unimpressive when she decides to adorn herself with armor and fight the extremely believable and excellently portrayed Evil Queen. Perhaps the director and writers depended too heavily upon the audience's knowledge of this fairy tale and therefore chose to develop the often unseen evil characters, such as the dark forest, troll, Queen and her army so even when good wins in the end, you are left with only the dark imagery and a new-found respect for the queen rather than a love for good and Snow White.  At the same time, I applaud their respect for the fable and that although they alluded to a love affair between SW and the Huntsman, it leaves it to your imagination on the ending and doesn't upset true fans of the SW storyline who don't want to see any extreme storyline changes.  Another excellent and overlooked aspect of the film is the incredible CG work in the fairy garden, and on the dwarfs.

Additionally I thought it worth noting that the casting of Kristen Stewart did little to add or detract from the movie as she really is a sub-sub-character.

And while watching this, it gave a much clearer picture of the hypocrisy of Hollywood. If they do decide to create a sequel based on the movie it would not be in they're best interest to allow a situation where BOTH parties are at fault to dictate who is, and is not invited back. Ms. Stewart fit the part perfectly, and I will remind everyone and Hollywood that the soul purpose of the industry is to make money, that has been proven time and again with every Michael Bay movie made. They have no right to make moral judgements that they themselves do not even follow. I hope that in the end the fellow cast members realize this and stand their ground for Ms. Stewart, we all reap what we sow, and it is not for others to make the decisions of the out come.

Back to the movie, I'm a guy that decided to watch this on my own because of the hope that it was not to sappy. It was nice to see a very gritty take on a tale that far to often focuses on the romance of the situation. Besides the use of magic, it was much more realistic on how it presented the time period and the actual risk presented to those involved.

4754387,4,B005LAIHSQ,"CONS
Somebody wasn't very good about the details in this movie - young snow white had medium brown hair instead of ""hair as dark as a raven"" (and you see this RIGHT after the narrator is saying her description) and on top of that, instead of ""skin as white as snow"" she had freckles!  And they don't even make her lips red. The older snow white does have dark hair but they still didn't redden her lips - went with a more natural rosy mauve.

Much to my surprise, the online picture quality for some reason was not very good (might have to buy a BR-DVD disk instead of watching this online).

PROS:
Good special effects - the evil queen has some pretty awesome powers
Charlize Theron gives an excellent performance as the evil queen in this, and Kristen Stewart (SW) and Chris Hemsworth (the huntsman) are good too.

It was a little long but I enjoyed this and absolutely recommend.

STORY:
Queen finds a rose in the winter, goes to pluck it and instead is pricked.  Some of her blood falls on the white snow and she decides it looks so pretty and hopes that if she has a daughter that her skin is white as snow, with lips as red as blood, hair dark as a ravens wings (the queen herself has black hair and fair skin), and that her daughter has the strength of that rose she couldn't pluck.  Later on she is blessed with a beautiful daughter like this.  Perhaps 7-8 years later the queen dies (doesn't say of what) and a ""dark"" foe draws the king into battle.  When they are killed, these soldiers break into dark shards - they are clearly not natural.  When the battle is over the king finds what appears to be a prisoner of the foe, all chained up and dirty like a prisoner - but she is beautiful and he marries her immediately.  On their wedding night she reveals her hatred for men and kills him and lets in her brother and her real army and they take over the kingdom.  Snow White (SW) tries to escape and ends up being locked in the north tower (as her blood/life may be useful to this dark queen at some point.)  And the land of the kingdom suffers under of evil and neglect (so everything appears to be covered with ash/soot or is mud, the plants all dead.

One day an attempt is made on the evil queens life and when she uses her magic to kill the would-be murderer it drains her beauty and her powers.  And on this day the mirror tells the queen that SW is surpassing her beauty and becoming the fairest of the land (which threatens her powers) but if she takes her heart she will never again weaken or age -  basic immortality.

The evil queen sends her brother to fetch SWs heart. SW manages to wound him and escapes into the dark forest - where the queen has no powers.  She promises a huntsman that if he brings her SW, she can give him back his beloved deceased wife with her powers. And so begins the story...",1347926400,,2832,4.269662921348314

Sadly, Kristen Stewart either wasn't given much to do except look angsty or the 5 min chance she got to kick some butt at the end of the movie... or she just played Bella.

Secondly, Id like to commend Universal on not only going the Ultraviolet streaming route but also giving us the choice of having our own digital copy we can watch on iTunes or whatever on our actual computers.

4754390,1,B005LAIHSQ,"I've had few consumer experiences bad enough to demand that I write a review and warn people away, but this movie ranks as one of the worst.  Ten minutes into this lifeless drivel, with its stilted, laughable, recycled dialogue and rampant overuse of the ""make stuff look melty"" button by the special effects department, I knew I was in for a real winner.

I found myself compulsively tweeting, trying to find anyone who could help me reconcile the fact that this stuff was actually happening on a film that presumably went through some editing first.  Why do those mushrooms have eyes?  Why were the fairies depicted as poorly rendered little gray naked people?  Did they use the whole CGI budget on making Kristen Stewart appear vaguely lifelike?  Why does that troll just want a hug?  Why is Chris Hemworth's accent so weird? Why won't Stewart ever close her mouth?  Why was she already wearing pants and boots in the dungeon, and why is the Duke's army suddenly fully equipped and ready to go kill the vaguely evil queen after one of the most dismal, idiotic inspirational speeches in the history of Hollywood?

Surprisingly, Stewart isn't even the worst part of this movie (I did enjoy watching her slog through poo water), and that's saying something.  Sam Claflin was the only one who looked like he was even bothering to show up to work, stuck in the middle of an otherwise wooden cast that often appeared just as confused and annoyed as I felt.

Bottom line?  Save your $3.99 and go watch...well, just go watch anything else instead.  Some drying paint might be mildly more entertaining.

Filmed mostly in not Sooo techni-color, it stars Ravenna...the most evil of all evil witches in all the land, played by Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart as Snow White, the most emotionless unsympathetic expressionless Princess pure of heart that there ever was. Rounding out our principle cast of characters are Sam Spruell as Ravenna's weak sister of a brother, Finn, Sam Claflin as William (Prince Charmer) and Chris Hemsworth as ""The Huntsman"".

Our story begins with glorious anticipation as we watch newly crowned Queen Ravenna quickly implement her devious diabolical scheme of treacherous trickery to take over the Castle and the entire Kingdom for her very own!

Soon we discover that her beauty and power is rivaled only by her evil!

Each day Ravenna gazes into the mirror and asks, ""mirror mirror on the wahl, who's the fairest of them awl"". Obediently, a liquid gold oozes from the mirror transforming itself into a golden Genie who responds reluctantly, ""You are the fairest of them all"".

Way too soon we find our sullen Princess, Snow White, locked away in the dingy dirty dank dark dungeon where she has been held captive since childhood when her father, the King, was slain unceremoniously by his bride Ravenna on the very night of their wedding day!

After some 20 years the Princess skillfully escapes her palace prison and high tails it directly into the forbidden forest!

Continuing down the yellow brick road, our story turns into a much darker version of the Wizard of Oz where our Princess meets up with the tin man and the cowardly lion, just kidding!

But She does encounter all sorts of strange and nasty forest creatures who try to kill her dead at every turn! All the while being tracked and chased by the drunken Huntsman and Finn, who have been sent to find her and return her to the evil Queen So that she can tear out her heart!

I did find a few fleeting Thrills n Chills once upon a time in our fairytale; including Fairies, a big bad ugly Troll guarding the bridge (sigh) and at least 7 Dwarfs!

If sucking in your breath and popping a tear out of your eye and mumbling your lines is all that is required then I qualify to be an actress. I started watching and Snow White as a little girl was alright. Then cut to the grown-up and yuck. As long as she does not talk it is better. Frankly, I could not wait for Chris Hemsworth to show up on screen, and as far as I am concerned he did not show up fast enough. The one funny line has The Huntsman cutting away her dress and she looks at him like she thinks he is going to ravage her. He looks at her and says "" don't flatter yourself"". That sums up just about everything about her. Watching them plod through the forest is torture.  The actors who play the dwarves are hilarious, they steal the movie. The scene where the two male leads talk about the inner light of Snow White and how you have to be blind not to see it, made me wonder if they got through that without gagging. To be blunt the most exciting thing about the movie was finding out she was not so snowy white and was sleeping with the director. I saw they were planning a sequel and I would like to know what for? I do believe they are plotting a spin-off for the huntsman, and if Chris Hemsworth is doing it I will be the first in line. Just not more of this same drivel.

Charlize Theron on the other hand is mesmerizing as the evil Ravenna.  When Theron's on screen, this movie takes fire and you can't take your eyes off her.  Her Oscar-winning stature is not denigrated in an otherwise average film.
SNOW WHITE is sumptuous to view, capturing the grim fairy tale ambience effectively.  James Newton Howard's score is excellent and the effects are noteworthy.  Using noted actors such as Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, etc.  was controversial and offended many SGA card carrying dwarves, but the CGI transformations are brilliantly done and its hard to fault or criticize this casting decision.  Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman is requisite hero sturdiness, but nothing outstanding.

Chris Hemsworth is good; he certainly has talent and depth but I kept wondering what was going to happen with him and Snow White (what was with the lips on lips kiss he gives Snow while she's in her death-sleep?) Was there anything between them at all? Was there anything between Snow and William? What's going on with that?

First the bad: I looked at this movie through the eyes of one who isn't a fan of any of the people in it or directing it. I couldn't honestly give it 5 stars because the story between Snow and the Huntsman and Snow's One True Love was a bit clumsy and changing a beloved fairy tale was jumping the shark (IMHO). Putting the unnecessary scenes aside (the trip to the woman's only camp? Still in the dark on the why of that one), the walk through the fairy forest and then being attacked by the evil Queen's henchmen? I don't know, maybe I'm a hopeless hopeful, but it seems to me, the fairies would have warned them it was coming, but what do I know. The fact that the Great Snow pulled together her own army after being kissed NOT by her One True Love, but the Huntsman who I'm not sure we even know who he is anyway, even to the end, where he stands at the back of the ""church"" whilst Snow is crowned ends up in a big mess. The entire ending scene was a big question mark to me. Why was it all so slow and odd? The Seven Dwarves? I didn't get that either. There were other :-O throughout the movie, but I'm tired so I'll go on to the good.

I think Charlize Theron was spectacular in her role as the evil queen. She scared me to death, that's for sure. I thought the cinematography was quite wonderful throughout the entire movie. I actually thought Kristen Stewart was quite good as Snow White. In fact, I can't fault any of the actors at all. It's the STORY that was the problem. The beautiful parts intertwining with the dark parts could have been done SO MUCH BETTER. Sometimes when you mess with a storyline that works, you don't end up with something better. Had the director stuck to the actual storyline we all know and love about Snow White, with the beautiful CGI and the amazing cast he had at his disposal, I think we would have seen a 5-star movie. I wanted so badly to give this 4 stars, but in the end, there were more questions than answers, it could have been a MUCH better movie given the looks of the amount of money these producers and the director had to spend on it.

This movie should have been at LEAST a 4-star movie with the support it had in cast, money and CGI - and it's so disappointing that, to me, it was quite wasted. When will these Hollywood people learn that when our world is in so much turmoil, we want to be swept away with familiar entertainment, not some new twist we have to think about? They truly need to go out and hobnob amongst the unwashed masses and ask us what we WANT if they want to stop wasting money needlessly and start making lots and lots of money again? Considering a lot of us out here are without jobs, without the ability to pay our bills, we would LOVE to have the money wasted on this movie. The money would have been better spent just sending each jobless family a check in the mail. Sorry - just my opinion. And it's not one I want to have. I WANTED this movie to be great! Quite frankly, I am being generous giving it 3 stars. Because in my heart, that's how much I wanted this movie to be great.",1347753600,,3260,4.187898089171974

She unlocks the kingdom's gates to let her brother and his army into the city. The entire town is at war and Snow White is trapped in the city and the Queen imprisons Snow White (Kristen Stewart) in a tower.

He tells her she is the fairest of them all. The Queen absorbs the life force from other women to stay young and she wants to live forever. The Queen then has all of the people in the city slain except for Snow White.....

I love movies of all types and I rarely rate them poorly but this movie was just lacking on many levels. It possibly has one of the worst scripts for a major motion picture I have ever seen. I looked it up and the movie cost over $170 million to make and you would think they would have spent more on the script. Kristen Stewart didn't say 10 words until the middle of the movie and then I wish she had kept her mouth shut. She acted stiffly and bored and like she was reading from cue cards off the set. The only saving grace for this movie was the beautiful Charlize Theron and even she could not save this film. While at times she performed her role perfectly there were other times that her character was just over the top of expected reality. I can only attribute that to poor directing.

I cannot recommend it to you as a good movie. If you like Charlize Theron then you should see it but otherwise it is not a real entertaining film. The length of the film is about 2 hours and 11 minutes and it should have been cut by 30 minutes.",1347753600,,2061,4.1475
4754856,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Fantasy. Allegorical. Classic literary (even if it's not Brit Lit). Directors and actors seem pathologically compelled to use a British accent whenever we're sitting down for a good bit of storytelling. For pete's sake, they went to the trouble of reintroducing many original Grimms' bits, previously all but lost to countless flowery Disney variations on this story. So if you're going to force an accent, why not the original German?  German or Brit, phoney accents add nothing to the quality of the dialog; in fact, it ends up emphasizing weaknesses in the script. And when principals lack either the natural skill or coaching required to pull it off, busted dialects are a huge distraction. Now, adorable rake Chris Hemsworth handled the Scots brogue a bit better than the bizarre British accent he attempted in ""Thor."" But Kristen Stewart had no idea on which side of the road she was driving (ooh, surprise), and even Theron occasionally struggled with sounding like a high school production of My Fair Lady.

With that said, it was a visual feast. Turn off the sound and watch some really gorgeous camera/lighting work and creative CGI that actually adds to the film rather than being just more shameless lily-gilding. I had to watch the mirror morphing and raven dress splat/reconstituting bits a couple of times. It's a beautiful movie and not entirely without merit. Get the HD/Blu-ray version, pop some corn and enjoy the show. But Hollywood, let's stop with the affected dialog.

Yes, you read that right--a nail and a bird.

The movie missed on so many levels.  The plot was barely plausible and so many people or things were introduced and then killed.  The magic mirror was even downgraded to a large shield that morphed into a blob.

For Pete's sake, could we not see more of Chris Helmsworth's body?  Where and what this ""light"" that Snow White had that everyone commented on?  Why were we subjected to Kristen's poor acting?

4754858,3,B005LAIHSQ,"***Safe review, contains NO spoilers***

If you're looking for a flashy, visually polished fantasy film with very little depth, this is the film for you. Overall, it's not un-entertaining, but it falls short of being anything great.

Let's start with the pros:

- It's a very pretty film with polished, stunning special effects, good costumes, and a relatively decent set
- The plot moves quickly with lot's of action; there are few slow moments
- Charlize Theron's character is interesting and relatively well-acted
- Lots of potential...undeveloped potential, but potential all the same!

And the cons:

- Kristen Steward's performance is abysmal. Her expression doesn't change for the first fifty minutes of the film. Her lines are delivered in a monotone...and her character makes no sense, which really isn't her fault
- The plot and characters wander aimlessly throughout the entire film. There's plenty of chances to develop characters, but these are never used effectively. Most of the characters have little to no backstory or motivation, and the things they do are often inexplicable
- Why is it Snow White? The Snow White story is scarcely used, and the story would have been stronger if it had stood on its own
- Contrived fantasy, at best. Most of the fantasy elements were clearly drawn from films like LOTR, Narnia, and Legend.

Overall, its a movie to rent, not buy, and to watch with popcorn. Whatever you do, don't focus too much on it!",1347753600,,1454,4.962962962962963

I am NOT a fan of Twilight or Kristen Stewart- AT ALL-  but I have to give it to her in this role, she's actually good.

She plays a very realistic 17 year old.  She is awkward, stumbling and completely sincere as any naive 17 year old girl would be.  That is any naive 17 year old who just found out she is the only salvation of an entire country.  I hate to say it, but I was kind of impressed with her.  Even more astonishing is how much range Chris Helmsworth shows in his role as the drunk, angry huntsman- he is great.  The only thing that was off for me initially was Theron's Evil Queen.  I think Charlize Theron is a wonderful actress but her Evil Queen is... strange.  She is oddly overdramatic and just plain weird until.. you realise that in this version of Snow White, the Evil Queen is severely mentally ill, not just evil for evil's sake, then the story makes sense.

But I don't fault any other actors (including Stewart) because this film suffers from a weak script. Great ideas, wonderful score and CGI... just a weak script.

The special features are underplayed. We are treated with short featurettes focusing on the main characters. We have another on the generalities of the world, the Dark Forest, The Fae Forest. The troll, the dark fae guards of obsidian. The entire time I couldn't help but think of the faerie tales of the Brothers Grimm, and how easily comparable the film was.

4754863,4,B005LAIHSQ,"SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN stars a persistent Kristen Stewart, a continuously morphing Charlize Theron, and a stalwart Chris Hemsworth hoisting an ax in lieu of a hammer.  All together I found them a likable cast for this surprisingly complex and detailed version of Snow White, which, as I suspect is true for most people, I knew primarily through the Disney cartoon.  I detected a faint visual echo of Disney's Evil Queen when Theron's Ravenna immerses herself in the milk bath,and we see her frighteningly perfect visage surrounded by a pure white akin to the Disney Queen's severe cape collar.  But this film is much more epic in feel and scale, more serious, darker, and certainly more feminist.  The sets vary from unpleasant-- the Dark Forest, Queen Ravenna's decaying castle-- to strangely beautiful-- the rocky sea cliff where Snow White finds her horse and the revelatory waterfall scene with the White Hart. (Actually, that scene, although hyperreal and very pleasing to the eye, has a moment where the seer says to the Huntsman ""she is the one,"" and I flashed back, I'm sure inappropriately, to Keanu Reeves as Neo in the Matrix, another One.)  In this Snow White Stewart portrays a reluctant, kind-hearted heroine summoned to battle by necessity.  The screenplay seems to want us to sympathize with Ravenna by supplying a cruel backstory:  poverty, a jilting in love she has never recovered from, and an unwished-for power, but that Ravenna does not seem to sit comfortably with the fully evil acts she perpetrates with no sense of remorse.  Theron does well with the mixed messages of the script and on some level it seems it hardly matters:  the costumes, like the sets, are detailed, imaginative, and it's great to see non-kitschy, non-Monty Python Medieval/Renaissance fashions and images.  Stewart has a definite style, breathy and restrained, always looking as though something is going on at the back of her mind.

Art direction, costumes, cinematography, screenplay, performances: all work in harmonious concert to construct a consistent world with roots that delve deep into the wellsprings of myth.  Jung and Campbell would be pleased.  The director, especially, is to be commended for ""sticking to his guns"" by keeping the tone and quality of the film's look and action squarely within the world he's created. No anachronistically modern sensibility here; no winking at the audience; and no cheap laughs.

She was amazing as Ravenna, the evil queen.  I was more emotionally invested in her character than anyone else's in the movie.  At the end of the film I was actually hoping that she would triumph over Snow White (the beat down she laid on Kristen Stewart was awesome)!  Watching the dynamics between her and her brother (an excellent performance by Sam Spruell)was worth the price of the rental. I do wish they would have spent more time developing Chris Hemsworth's (the Huntsman) and Sam Claflin's (William) character's.  They did a great job of portraying the torment (Hemsworth for his wife and Claflin for abandoning the Princess), but there just wasn't enough there to evoke more than just passing sympathy. 4 stars for the movie and a purchase of the Blu-ray for my collection.

P.S. On Stewart's performance: I will agree that her motivational moment was laughable.  She also didn't come across to me as innocent.  I could have been jaded by the whole infidelity thing and had that filter on while watching the movie, but her body language with the other cast members seemed more ""sultry"" than anything else.",1347667200,,1259,4.850467289719626
4755051,3,B005LAIHSQ,"If a movie is going to have the title of Snow White and the Huntsman, perhaps the investors should have invested in a Snow White that can do more than stand on an X and look unsure of herself.

The title of the movie should have been ""EVIL QUEEN: mein kampf"", eh? eh? Sounds better right? Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen was an excellent choice. She is able to garner sympathy and show that at one time she herself was victim to another persons life-altering decision - was that her mother or neighborhood witch that initiated the curse? Honestly, I feel the movie would have been more interesting if it covered the history of the Queen and the numerous (20?) kings she overthrew. I feel that with all the cunning and intelligence that the Evil Queen had, surely, her agenda was greater than that of stealing women and taking their youth. With all the time she spent on earth, surely her persona, wisdom and goals were far greater than that. The manner in which she created a false army to appear as a beautfiul victim to seduce the King indicates how cunning she is. There is so much more with regards to direction that the industry can take with Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen.

I once saw on a blog that in one of the earlier centuries, the word ""nice"" meant foolish or simpleton(?). Kristen Stewart, you look great, and apparently with her as the featured actress in this movie, the audience these days is expecting more than a pretty face who stands on a mark and appears ""nice"". At least I do. She needs to take acting lessons. What she got away with in Twilight stopped working here in this movie.  Hey, when you're at your jobs, you don't get better by people telling you how great you are and letting things slide. You don't get away on the job with your looks, its not the real world. I just feel as though someone who had more....live theater experience possibly, could have handled the part of Snow White better. Yes, Kristen Stewart is gorgeous and she has that certain something that makes you want to watch her, but sometimes, it just isn't enough.

Overall, if you're interested in the Queen and watching Charlize Theron show the underlings what acting is all about, I recommend this movie. The 3 stars are for Charlize, because she carried it that far. Way to go Charlize!",1347667200,3,2294,4.5204819277108435

4755115,1,B005LAIHSQ,"I was hesitant because of all the Kristen Stewart bashing going around these days. I am a big fan of Chris Hemsworth and  Charlize Theron. I mean, on paper this should have been a good movie.

It's not.

The script is disjointed and forced. The plot has so many holes it would give a Humvee problems. Kristen Stewart is actually pretty bad. Very odd expressions and her emotional range is as bad as the internet memes indicate. She delivered a few of her lines fine, but I get the feeling the director gave up about half way through the movie.

Even Charlize and Chris aren't at their best here. Some sparks of brilliance showing through.

The best part of this movie is the 7 dwarves. I wish they had spent more time on these guys and less time on a senseless love triangle that never resolves anyway.

Also, the fantasy elements seem very slapdash. Even a good fantasy system has some rules and some definition. You never really get that here. I mean, I still am not really sure what gives Snow White any ability here to charm a troll? Maybe there was something I missed with the fairies... i fell asleep for about 10 min in the middle.

What is with Kristen Stewart, I mean, every time she seems to be summoning some kind of emotion, she usually just looks like she is passing some really bad gas.

Anyway, if you want to watch Snow White, stick with the animated version, its still the best. If you want to see Charlize, watch 7 Days in the Valley and if you want to see Chris at his best, watch the first 10 min of Star Trek (2009). If you want to see Kristen Stewart, I can't help you, maybe go see an eye doctor or a shrink.",1347667200,106,1631,4.289902280130293

Charlize Theron was phenomenal in her role. I would have to say her role was done the best out of all of them. Snow white started off bland but Kristen Stewart grew into the part as the movie progressed. This was the first time for me watching Kristen Stewart in a role. Charlize Theron performance just made Kristen Stewart's performance seem lack luster, but it wasn't really that bad just not phenomenal.
The story itself was well written. For a short screen time it gave enough depth to the main characters to make the story worth watching. I especially like the depiction of the dwarfs.
I wonder if people thought this was going to be some nice Disney like Snow White. It is not. This is how a fairy tale used to be told pre-Disney.

4755119,5,B005LAIHSQ,"*spoilers*
Snow White has never been one of my favorites in the fairy tale realm. Sleeping Beauty and Rapunzel were always more my cup of tea. But this re-telling was captivating. Charlize Theron stole the show as the wicked queen, twisting evil with a smattering of sorrow/sympathy that never quite won me over to Snow White's view of things. What I mean is, I never quite fell 100% to the side of wishing the Queen would redeem herself. Of course, that isn't how the story goes anyway, right?

I was disappointed when it was the Huntsman's kiss that woke Snow White rather than William finally gathering up the courage to confess his love and bring her back from death's brink. However, I did enjoy the fact that it was not a typical ""love triangle"" (yawn) between Snow, William, and the Huntsman but more of a jaded man with life experience impressing upon the younger man to go for his dreams. Even the reviving kiss wasn't really a kiss of LOVE as in the fairy tale by Disney but more of a selfless love of a knight for his queen. ""Courtly Love"", I believe they call it. Throw in the fact that she never was told who woke her, and it left the tired ""love triangle"" out of the mix.

Gone, also, was the typical ""the man gets the girl"" ending. The jury is still out on how I feel about that....

It is about time for fantasy and fairy tale to be taken seriously in the movie realm of things, and I wonder how much we have Peter Jackson (LoTR, King Kong, The Hobbit) to thank for that? This is definitely on my buy list.",1347580800,3,1522,4.333333333333333
4755120,5,B005LAIHSQ,"I expected to like this film if for no other reason than I expect Charlize Theron films to be of a high caliber--also, I like fairy tales.  I was not disappointed; in fact, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting something like a fantasy-horror film, but it turned out to be much heavier on the fantasy element than is typically seen in contemporary mainstream movies.  This worked out quite well for me because I enjoy fantasy.  In fact, the movie reminded me of The Lord of the Rings trilogy in a few places, if only for the epic scene shots.

In terms of the characters, Charlize Theron's Queen stole the show.  She was a character with some real depth, more fully fleshed out than I think I've ever seen the ""evil queen/stepmother"" character portrayed.  The Queen ended up being a far more compelling character than Snow White, in fact, because she felt more human.  She's not just some woman who turned to dark magic because she was vain and evil for the sake of being vain and evil; she's a traumatized, fearful woman who became cruel in a world SHE percieved to be dark and cruel.  As evil as she was, I pitied her--and THAT is a good villain. Theron did an excellent job bringing this character to life, and was, as always, stunningly beautiful.  I particularly like what she did with her voice, making it deep and round--it gave her a real presence.

I've seen some reviews that complain about Kristen Stewart's role, but the truth of the matter is that Snow White is not the real protagonist of this movie in my opinion.  Snow White is written as a grail maiden in this film; a living embodiment of goodness and purity (and they're not subtle about it).  She has no flaws and does not grow at all during this movie, because she does not need to.  Her only real ""journey"" in this film is literal.  She is a plot device.  I think Stewart pulls this role off competently, if not with Theron's skill.

The true protagonist of Snow White and the Huntsman is the Huntsman.  The Huntsman is an interesting character.  In the fairy tale, he pities Snow White and so lets her escape, fooling the Queen into believing he has killed her.  He takes a more active role in this movie.  It is his choices that allow the movie to take shape, and he is the character who grows the most in the film.  He makes an interesting foil for the Queen--they've both been shaped by trauma and bitterness and anger, but while the Queen embraces her bitterness, the Huntsman...well, I won't spoil it.  But HE is the character who has an inner journey, thus, to me, he is the protagonist; incidentally, he is also the narrator.  Helmsworth pulls the character off nicely.  He's always fun to look at, and he's managed to bring the charaters he plays to life in unique ways in every movie I've seen him in.  In fact, even though I recognized him, I had to double check that he was who I thought he was because his Huntsman was so different from Papa Kirk and Thor.  And I really enjoyed the accent (although I admit I probably wouldn't be able to recognize a bad one if I heard it).

One of my favorite things about this movie is its take on love.  In the fairytale, it is true love's kiss that awakens Snow White from death.  In this movie, I don't think they mean for that love to be seen as 'romantic'.  I'm not sure how to explain it without spoiling the movie, but I enjoy the nontraditional presentation.

There are a few things I think could have been done better.  I would have liked the film to either make Snow White more of a character and less of a plot device, or fully embrace the Huntsman as the main character.  It waffled, and that's the reason that the villain was the most impactful character in the movie.  I also would have liked to see them do more with the other characters.  The dwarves were interesting, but William and his foil, the Queen's brother, had potential they didn't really live up to (I think the actors did a good job, but the characters just weren't given the chance to develop fully in the plot)--and most of the other characters were just background.  The movie had some breathtaking scenes, but was a little too heavy on the computer graphics at the same time.  But overall I really enjoyed the movie.",1347580800,4,4226,4.461538461538462

You could have had the best actors out there, and this would have been a failure. I think whoever was responsible for this movie just couldn't decide what they wanted it to be. Action, angst, madness? It tries all and fails miserably. Seriously, ""Mirror, Mirror"" is better than this.

My problems with the plot:

***Someone needs to read ""The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord"" (number 2 can be read as ""sewer"" instead of ventilation duct. Number 3 is especially applicable.)*****

1. Why is there a nail in the wall of a castle? Anyone?

2. She took him out with a scratch to the face. Come on, at least leave him with one less eye. (the whole pedobear thing was really over the top as well. We already know he's evil. don't make it too much) Why do the whole fake-seduction routine anyway? come on, she (the character) should be perfectly innocent at this time. Guile should be beyond her.

3. Why tell the dupe he is being duped right at the exact moment when you shouldn't? (see suggested reading above)

4. If the dark forest is so dangerous that no one comes out alive, why does EVERYONE come out alive?

5. If the movie is supposed to be about ""inner beauty"", why do the women have to disfigure themselves? Because the evil queen is crazy, right? but crazy isn't reliable, so this is a logic fail.

6. Why are all the queen's henchmen ok with all this? They aren't apparently getting anything out of this, the first time some real work comes around, the first thing she does is outsource it. And she can make minions out of glass, so why does she need henchmen anyway? Why did she need a ""real"" army when it's pretty hard to kill a broken piece of glass?

7. Apparently her brother wants her as well. Ew[...] too much over-the-top evil. (If my brother ever tried to kiss my neck like that, he would soon be my sister)

8. How come Snow White knows how to ride a horse after being locked in a tower most her life? (I'm pretty sure the first horse is a magic fairy horse, but still. And bareback even.) Or dance? Or tame trolls? (or ride in plate? or swing a sword?) And why are there fairies in the tale of Snow White? Weren't the dwarves and her ""perfection"" enough to swallow already?

9. If she's been locked in a tower most her life, how do all the soldiers know to yell ""get her""? (Get who? never seen her before, is she new? What, I thought the princess was dead?) How come the whole castle knows who she is, but no one else does?

10. Why, why, why , WHY the flock would you throw away your shield? WHY?!!!! If you suddenly know how to fight, you do not throw away the best thing to keep other people from using a sword on you!

I'm going to stop here, or I will be writing all day!

*********End spoilers************

I think this movie is a perfect example that all the originality in Hollywood is dead and gone. It's the same garbage over and over, trying to squeeze a buck out of anything that doesn't run away fast enough. Plot holes you could drive a semi through, no research on the way things work (the Grey is a massacre of the natural order), physics has no hold on Hollywood... I can't think of any movies in the past couple of years that made me go ""Wow, that was flocking AWESOME!"" that didn't start out as a book or a game first*. (are TV shows done in Hollywood? Walking dead is completely engrossing. I can't get enough. {yes, WD was a comic first, but still. Spectacular acting, perfect cast, etc} Same with ""Once Upon a Time"", and ""Grimm"". Maybe Hollywood should just give everything over to whoever is responsible for awesome TV shows.)

Fact is, a lot of these Disney creatures seem to be just thrown into the film extemporaneously as a substitute for an actual plot and as a filler for the long periods where nothing happens; or perhaps they were tossed in just in case there were some three year olds in the audience. A lot of the ""special effects"" bordered on the ridiculous or inane, such as when the ""mirror mirror on the wall"" uses the ""liquid metal"" imagery from Terminator 2, to create a liquid metal man which stands before the queen to tell her she is beautiful. Totally ridiculous--so much could have been done with a magic mirror, but this director has a liquid metal man pour out of it. LOL--ridiculous. In addition to having almost no plot, this film suffers from really bad acting. Whereas Charlize Theron is a total A+ babe and an excellent actress, Kristen Stewart has almost no acting ability, and her facial expression never changes. Fact, is, Kristen Stewart has a very masculine face and looks like an unpleasant worn-out street strumpet, a harridan, and somewhat of an evil hag, at age 20 or whatever she. My opinion, she is rather ugly and it is painful to watch a movie starring an unpleasant mannish young woman who can't act, can't smile, and has no charm or personality when at the same time we're supposed to believe she is playing the part of an innocent angelic beautiful princess. If she had pulled out a bottle of whiskey to take a slug, or stopped to shoot up some heroin while hiding in the woods it would not have been out of character given her persona.

I was very impressed with the religious symbolism and the use of imagry to portray the moral dualism between the queen and snow white.  The musical score was also amazing.  When Snow White defeated The Queen, I was taken for a moment by the beauty of the orchestra playing the ""background"" music.  I enjoyed the film very much, and I will watch it again so I can see if I can pick up more hidden easter eggs of symbolism.  As far as the acting went, I think that Charlize Theron's rendition of the queen was superb.  The rest of the cast was also very impressive.  I am not a big fan of Kristen Stewart.  However, I think that the director did a good job of giving us the best of her acting abilities, and it also seemed like she had very few lines for a main character.  I am only giving this movie four stars, because I can't give it four and a half.  I would say to watch this movie if you feel like watching a movie that will make you think, but still keep you blissfully far away from the realities of our modern world.  If you are looking to watch a great action movie, the plot may seem to drag a bit and the action is not extremely action packed.

4755384,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I just want to start off by saying that I wanted to like this movie. I really did. However, this film is depressingly skin deep.

The good. The camerawork is absolutely stunning, the special effects as well. Your eyes tell you that there is a marvelous film before you, but that is as far as it goes. I have to say, before I start the bashing, that Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth try their absolute hardest making something out of the lines that they are given. Their performances were touching (Theron more so than the rest) and they at least gave some substance to it.  Hemsworth carried most of the film when Theron wasn't in the picture. If it were just a story between the two of them, even with the horrible lines that they were given, it would have been at least a four star film.

Now for the bad, and when I say bad, I mean terrible. I never had much of an opinion about Kristen Stewart before this movie. I steadfastly stayed away from Twilight so I thought I had a pretty clean slate to judge going into this. Stewart, who plays Snow White, has been locked in a tower for years only to escape right before the Queen (Theron), who killed her father the King, kills her and takes her heart. Needless to say, after somehow finding this out in a slightly perverted scene, Snow White runs away. Then she runs away again after she loses her magic pony (actually, she abandons him). Then the Huntsman joins in and he runs away with her too. At some point there's a Troll for all of 30 seconds, then scarred women for another minute or so. At about the 1 hour mark we finally meet the dwarves.  Throughout all of this, we maybe get 10 mumbled lines from Stewart. I can't say that this is entirely her fault. It is the writing that is terrible. But then we get to the acting. I swear, every single time Hemsworth spoke to Stewart you could see the pleading in his eyes. It's as if he were trying to say, ""Please, give me some sort of emotion to go on!!"" Alas, Stewart just stares back at him and breathes. Literally.  This is the Snow White we get. A breathing, slightly constipated looking girl who squints off into the distance looking slightly befuddled.  You can almost tell that the director is obsessed with Stewart from all of the closeups you get of her. I mean after about the 20th time I get it. She's beautiful. Now show me something MORE. I mean, Snow White, you were LOCKED AWAY in a TOWER for YEARS after witnessing the DEATH of your FATHER and the FALL of your KINGDOM. Any human being would have had some sort of melt down, but all we get is Stewart, looking beautiful.  Hasn't anyone told these people that looks can only get you so far?

It was the wooden lead that sealed it for me. No matter how good the surrounding cast, you need a great lead to carry such a heavy weight of a film. Oh, and let's not forget to mention the patch work editing and dead dialogue that made it even worse. I was literally writhing in pain and hitting my forehead with my fist by the time it ended. Truly, it was pure agony to sit through for anyone who likes backstory and acting.

If you want to watch a visually stunning film, this is the movie for you. Before you go watch it though, I strongly suggest that you just mute out the scenes with Stewart, which is most of the film. After all, wasn't it only visual beauty that the director was trying to portray?

The fairest of them all truly is only skin deep.",1347494400,284,3419,4.311526479750778

4755390,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Let's take a moment to re-imagine the classic fairy tale, Snow White, as something other than the whimsical version we all know. The story remains much the same-- A noble King and Queen give birth to a lovely daughter (Snow White). Shortly thereafter the Queen dies, and in all his grief, our King takes on a beautiful new bride. Little does the King know this will be his undoing, for his new wife, Ravenna, is an evil, man-hating sorceress. Soon the King is dead, Snow White is imprisoned and our quiet kingdom plunged into darkness and despair. With a little bit of ""Mirror, mirror on the wall"" action, Ravenna learns just how much her and Snow White's fates are intertwined. Snow will bring about Ravenna's destruction or she'll bring her total immortality. Naturally, you can guess which option Ravenna prefers. But in this version of the tale, Snow isn't as helpless as her Disney counterpart. She manages to escape her cell and goes on the run through the big, bad forest. Ravenna is mad, like steaming mad, so she enlists the dashing (but drunk) Huntsman to capture our much revered, Snow. During their epic journey, both the Huntsman and Snow White discover the grandeur of the destiny they're bound to fulfill and learn just how much they need one another.

In a world full of reboots, it's hard to keep a fresh perspective but Rupert Sanders somehow managed to pull it off in Snow White and the Huntsman. He's turned this familiar tale into a medieval epic adventure and made our seemingly docile heroine a total warrior. He has a distinctive and original directing style and its quick-cut nature works with the story he's decided to tell. I like what Sanders has done here and it works given the darker nature of the source material. The original Grimm story was not a happy one--it was dark and foreboding and, well, grim. I like that he wasn't afraid to take it to a darker place and he did so without losing the magic and whimsy of Disney's version. There are still dwarves and magic mirrors and poisoned apples and they all fit naturally in their own way. Without a doubt, this is the type of movie you want to watch in a movie theatre. But stunning as the cinematography is, the film does have its weaknesses.

I guess my main beef is the fact that the character development is somewhat lacking. We're given interesting back-story on Ravenna and Snow and the Huntsman and not nearly enough time to take it all in. It's enough to want to know more but not enough to satisfy. This causes the story to feel somewhat rushed and underdeveloped. It's like we're given the Sparknotes version of the story, not the whole thing. One of the movie's stronger elements was the great cast. What more could you want out of a movie featuring the likes of Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Stewart? Okay, majority of the cast is strong--I admit, I'm not a big fan of Stewart. I feel like she plays the same wide-eyed, mumbling girl in every movie she's in. She barely registers any kind of emotion and when she does, it's virtually indistinguishable from any other emotion. For example, there's a moment when she turns from a panic-stricken princess into a strong soldier, but it was laughable. No offense Kristen, but I just don't get the cut of your jib, if you know what I'm saying.

Theron as the Queen Ravenna, on the other hand, she made that movie. Every time she came on screen, I just couldn't tear my eyes away. Not only was she absolutely stunning, she was utterly terrifying. I feared for the lives of everyone she came into contact with. She brought evil to a whole new level and it was frightening. Then there's Hemsworth who is certainly talented enough but his character was overshadowed by the phenomenal performances of Theron and the bumbling of Stewart. I don't think he was given enough of a chance to shine on his own. And the chemistry between him and Stewart felt too forced, I just wasn't buying their love story. Where the main cast was lacking in chemistry, the supporting cast certainly succeeded. With the talents of Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost and Sam Spruell it's hard to go wrong. They own the screen and some of the movie's better moments are thanks to them. Despite its set-backs, I think Sanders has crafted a beautiful and strong retelling of Snow White. Overall, I think the Grimm brothers would be proud.

Food for Thought: As Sanders' debut film, Snow White and the Huntsman is quite strong. It's full of action, adventure, drama with even a touch of comedy--all the things you want in a summer blockbuster. In the same vane as the original Grimm fairy tale, we see Snow White in a darker light which makes the heroine's arc that much more powerful. Well, at least it would if you actually cared for the heroine but this was one movie where I was rooting for the villain instead. A visually impressive film, it's one that's worth the money despite Stewart's relatively bland performance as Snow.

I have tried, and failed. Stewart is probably the most annoying actor in recent history, and beats DeCaprio for award of ""Whiny Actors in Movies, portraying a serious role"". With that said, I had debated watching this film, and the reviews were not in it's favor...at all. With that being said:

I actually enjoyed the movie, a lot. The Evil Queen was spectacular, the fight scenes were excellent and the concept of the overall movie was well thought out. I read reviews stating the action scenes weren't exciting enough, or long enough. I disagree. It is not ""300"", but it doesn't need to be, there is actually a good script and great filming. The fight scenes were well choreographed and shot. Long enough to be fun, but not annoying with undue filler to waste film time. Thankfully Stewart does not have a lot of lines, and that makes her role great. The lines shes has are OK, and yes, her little rousing speech is pretty strained feeling and not very well approached, filmed or executed, but its a small part of the film. I felt she actually portrayed her character, as written, really well. I would never call this movie Snow White in respect to following the commonly conceived notion of Snow White. Except for the dwarves and the Magic Mirror though. Think Snow White, alternate universe to Disney where Snow White is a vigilante EMO girl.

The mixing of a couple fairy tales into to movie was fun. Expect a cool troll scene and the dwarves and the forest scenes were fun and really well done.

I liked it and even my wife liked it. I would let my 3 yo old watch the forest scenes just for the beauty, but cant because of the content and language.

So, overall, to all you people who can not stand Stewart in her Sage movies, give it a chance. I think you'll like it. I did.",1347494400,4,1940,4.441011235955056

And what was happening with the last scene (coronation scene)?  Why was she just standing there & almost pretending to have a 'climax' ???

4755546,4,B005LAIHSQ,"""Snow White and the Huntsman""  is a dark retelling of the famous fairy tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs that emphasizes toxic jealousy, the usurping of royal power, premeditated homicide, and the power of evil magic.

Ravenna (Charlize Theron), an incredibly vain sorceress, has the ability to shape-shift, use her feminine wiles to enchant, and methodically seize absolute power.  Her prized possession is a round metallic mirror that assures her periodically that she is the fairest in the land.

After Ravenna has successfully disposed of her husband, the king and father of young Snow White, the queen imprisons the child and rules with malevolence. Years later, when her mirror delivers the news that Snow White (Kristen Stewart) will soon surpass her as the most beautiful woman in the kingdom, the queen plots her death. But Show White escapes into the Dark Forest, a place where the queen's magic doesn't work. Ravenna summons a drunk, rough-hewn huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), and orders him to find the young woman and kill her.

Ms. Theron acts up a storm here with a characterization that allows her plenty of opportunity to play her scenes to the max.  She makes a fearsomely wicked queen and, with the assistance of special effects, is a formidable adversary against Snow White.

Hemsworth (Thor in ""The Avengers"") once again carries a weapon, this time an ax, as the unwilling killer.  He is a big guy with a deep voice who looks and sounds the part of an uneducated clod. He rises to a state of heroism when he realizes what Snow White is up against and transforms from would-be assassin to protector.

Ms. Stewart (the ""Twilight"" saga) is the weak link in the cast. The script attempts to make Snow White more than a shuddering, defenseless naif, but Ms. Stewart appears to be phoning in her performance. There's little fire, and we never are convinced that she is in fear for her life.

Director Rupert Sanders has crafted a smart-looking movie, with special effects worked smoothly into the narrative rather than overshadowing it.  There are phantom armies, characters morphing into others, and normal-sized actors -- Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones, and Ian McShane -- digitally shrunk to portray the dwarfs who become Show White's allies.

The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains numerous bonus extras, including audio commentary by director and key crew members; behind-the-scenes footage; a video tour of the Pinewood Studio's sets on which the movie was shot; and four featurettes covering visual effects, characterizations, fairy tale elements, and ""Tone Poem,"" a proof-of-concept reel that sold the studio on the project.

4755548,4,B005LAIHSQ,"I am not much into fantasy films.  Personally, I find films such as ""Lord of the Rings"" to be unwatchable (sorry to you fans out there but the truth is the truth).  Usually, I just find that these types of films are problematic in many ways, mostly that I just can't connect with the characters and therefore can't have empathy for them.  Not so with ""Snow White and the Huntsman.""  Most of the characters I could relate to, but surely the star of the show - be it a dark star - would be Charlize Theron.

One of the only complaints that I might have about the film is that Ms. Theron nearly disappears midstream, but luckily she reappears to bring back her madness and mayhem in the third act.  Another complaint would be:  a little too much exposition by some of our characters.  Not to give too much away - you already know most of the story since naturally this is a take on the original fairy tale - but when someone wants to kiss our protagonist, Kristen Stewart, our knight in shining armor (or maybe make that ""knight in shining pewter"" perhaps) - decides to first discuss, to no one in particular, his life story.  But of course, it is easier to explain background information in a novel than it is in film.  Too bad, but often screenwriters must bite the bullet and use exposition to explain things, which comes across in a klunky fashion.  Just kiss her already!

But besides these complaints, the cinematography and costume design are fantastic.  Same goes for the special effects.  And the acting is even mostly good, even Ms. Stewart is better in this role than the ""Twilight"" series.

But the acting by our antagonist is superb.  A fairly big recommendation by someone who usually does not like fantasy.",1347408000,7,1718,4.547231270358306

I would still recommend this movie to anyone who's interested though because despite K-Stew being a crappy actress it's still a good movie and provides an interesting take on the classical Snow White story.

That women had the same frozen poker face throughout the film. Whether she was suppose to be scared, happy, hurt or fighting, she just had this blank, frozen, straight face without any expression. She can't act at all and I think she ruined the movie. There is no way to relate to this woman's character of Snow White. If she were over 50, I would think that she got too many Botox injections. Her face does not move. Too bad they didn't use a different actress. This could have been a great film with the right actress.",1347408000,23,775,4.388888888888889
4755552,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Let me understand; was Charlize Theron jealous because Kristen Stewart is better looking than her? In what universe? Totally absurd but still a good movie worth watching for the special effects and the incredible performance of Charlize Theron.

This is a free adaptation of the well know Snow White story, with several bad actors. The evil queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) saves the movie. Great presence and great acting as always. She definitely took over the movie. Although I knew the end of the movie (...who doesn't) I was rooting for the mean queen. I was really sad at the end when she died and she became old. Even then she was better looking than Snow White. Kristen Stewart is not believable in her role (she is not good actrice anyway), and the Huntsman has an Irish/Scottish accent that is annoying. We really don't believe anytime during the two hours that Hemsworth is this solid guy that will save Stewart in the dark forest and will protect her from all the mean spirits. The kissing scene where Snow White stands up and walk after eating the apple is so poorly done that is laughable. There is another character in the movie, an old friend of Snow White that we don't know exactly what he does and why he is there.

In order to make the movie better they should first try to find somebody who is a better actor that Stewart. Second there is a huge disadvantage to compare ANY woman to Charlize Theron (even the older version of the queen towards the end of the movie). They should have definitely find somebody else representing the mean ugly queen who is not as good looking as Charlize Theron. The only time that the words ugly and Charlize Theron can be used in the same sentence is the film ""Monster"". She definitely deserved the oscar with that performance.

I definitely liked the movie (4 stars) and the special effects are just awesome. The scene with Stewart and the troll in the forest while funny and not believable because of Stewart's acting, is really well acted by the troll. They also succeeded to put the head of some really good actors on the body of dwarfs (like Bob Hoskins). The special effects are unbelievable!",1347408000,5,2151,4.640419947506562

I enjoyed her more in this movie than any other I've seen her in, especially after ""Young Adult""-I swore I'd dislike her forever due to the character she played (yeah, dumb) and the lousy acting. But in this film, she shined! Her acting and the beautiful and sometimes haunting special effects were mesmerizing. Chris Helmsworth did a stellar job and the dwarves had me rooting for them. Now the reason for the four stars and not five: Kristen Stewart. Her performance was lackluster, boring, phoned-in.

I saw a enjoyable movie that brings to the big screen a version or snow white that it sounds like not many people knew about, I'm not a child anymore so I don't want the snow white we all grew up on. Kristen Stewart did a nice job I thought of bring snow white out of the kiddies section and up to a more adult level is her acting prefect no but who's is? I took the movie differently then most I saw all the actor's feeding off each other and also helpping weaker sceane stronger, there was chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth and also the other billing Charlize Thereon did a great nod as the evil Queen and the shot with the two main actresses was also very good?, all in all don't think I found anyone unlikeable nor did I not not enjoy this movie. The FX shots were top of the line I wounded if maken the movie a non 3D outing hurt it? I was happy there was no odd tint to the movie or no over done music.

Well as Snow White her reactions were almost continuous in her escape through the forest to her fight with the evil Queen !! The emotional roller coaster was really screaming as she pulled me through each episode !! The burnout from retakes she must experience must be beyond belief ! Kristen sure has my vote, and what ever she gets for playing these parts she deserves and should get more !! Now I'm a total fan !!!! She is a Super Star !!!!  A mild shock set in on Snow White's second run on the Big Screen(first time on computer) the next day !! The world's most beautiful victim getting hammered right to end !!

4755667,3,B005LAIHSQ,"At the end of an epic movie like this, I should be smiling wide enough to split my cheeks. I wasn't.

Charlize Theron is beautiful and poisonous as the queen. Chris Hemsworth is strong and rugged and handsome as the huntsman, although he was a little light on the emotion. The photography was lush and wonderful and perfect for a story like this. The lack is Kristin Stewart.

Kristin Stewart is pretty, but she should never wear her hair slicked back from her face. It makes her look like she has jug ears. That aside, her acting is limited and she made me feel nothing for her. Her wonder was pitiful, her anger forced, her rousing speech pretty lame in delivery, and otherwise, she was just . . . lacking. What this movie needed was a Snow White that would do justice to the rest of the cast and the photography. Kristin Stewart just doesn't have it. I should have been cheering the end of the Queen. Instead, I felt more oh, well, that's over. It was all right. Lukewarm is not what I want from an epic movie and one of my favorite fairy tales.",1347321600,29,1048,4.341836734693878
4755668,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This is one of those movies where everyone talks really quiet, BUT THEN THE MUSIC'S SO LOUD!  I don't get why people always have to whisper in movies.  The magic mirror's not really a mirror, it's a gong.  I kept telling her, ""Bitch, that ain't no mirror!""  The queen's brother is seriously the biggest creeper I've ever seen in a movie.  There's one scene where Kristen Stewart's running away, and she happens to find a magically convenient horse, and she's like, ""Hey, can I ride you?"" and the horse is like, ""Sure.""  In another scene, she staves off a troll attack by batting her eyes at it.  The fairy forest is pretty awesome, I'd like to live there.  Oh, and there's ass-kicking dwarves.  No really, the dwarves are in this movie!

Anyway.....it's a good movie.  The way it's advertised, you'd think it's just for teenagers, but that's not necessarily the case.  The romance is mostly a minor plot point, it's not overly sappy or anything.  A lot of people will immediately hate this movie just cause it has the Twilight chick in it.  They'll say, ""Oh my God, that person's existence is so untrendy!""  To them, I say grow up, it's not that big of a deal.  Basically, it's a spookier, more adult-ish version of the story.  If you're into that kind of imagery(I am), then you should like this movie.  If not, then you might like it anyway.  Give it a chance.  Don't just say, ""Oh, it's too gothic, it has Twilight lady in it!"" cause then you're attacking your own intelligence.  My only real complaint is that it's maybe a bit too long.  There's nothing mind-blowing about this movie, but it's all good fun.  Worth a rental at least.

Of course, this movie begs the question...if you were friends with Snow White, what would you call her?  Snow?  Whitey?  I would call her Whitey.",1347321600,5,1784,4.563291139240507
4755669,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I agree with so many of the other reviewers in their opinions of Kristen Stewart. She's not the best actress. I'm well beyond the age of the Twilight movies' target demographic, so I have never seen her in anything until this movie. I can think of a dozen other young actresses who would have brought more to this role and had more chemistry with both ""William"" and the ""Huntsman.""

Other than her performance, I thought the movie wasn't that bad. I would have ranked it higher if there was a better ""leading lady."" Though to be honest, I think the ""Queen"" was more of a leading lady than ""Snow White"" with how the movie was written. Charlize Theron was FANTASTIC.

All that said, I'm glad I didn't buy the movie on Blu-ray like I had thought about and did the on demand option instead with my cable company (it wasn't available to rent through Amazon). If you haven't seen it yet and are like me and haven't seen Kristen Stewart in anything before, you may want to go this same route before dropping the money to buy the movie.",1347321600,4,1028,4.4338624338624335

4755805,2,B005LAIHSQ,"My wife and I had looked forward to this film only to be severely disappointed.

The good in this film is entirely on Charlize Theron. Her acting is superb and you can tell that the other actors in this film are trying to rise to her level when they share scenes with her. Her queen is so evil it will give you shivers. Unfortunately, how scary-bad the rest of the film is will also give you shivers. As much as I like Chris Hemsworth, I couldn't help but feel that he was phoning this one in, at least a bit. Maybe because most of his scenes were opposite or adjascent to Kristen Stewart, I don't know for sure, but he never feels like more than a muscle-head in this film. It was like he wandered off of an action movie set and into the wrong studio. The dwarves had a lot of potential given the tremendous casting, but they are poorly used and underwhelming. The visuals are fantastic, but to be fair, they aren't anything unique in this CG-age of cinema. I didn't see anything new or innovative.

Finally, I must jump on the bandwagon with everyone else - Kristen Stewart was dreadful. Aside from her complete lack of emotional output, I can't recall a scene in this film when her mouth was hanging open. By the end of the film, my wife and I had become so bored that we took to MST3k-ing the film, adding much dialogue about her gaping maw. It was the only way we could make it to the end. The Snow White of this film is supposed to draw great pathos from the audience, have a harrowing ordeal, and then transform into a brilliant warrior monarch. All of this is delivered with the emotional range of a mannequin. In a time when several versions of Snow White are hitting the market at once, you would think that the producers would want theirs to redefine the character, making her seem more than the fairy tale character. Instead we get a vain attempt to copy the Snow from ""Once Upon A Time"" and do so with a far inferior actress.

This film was promoted on four major points: Stewart, Hemsworth, Theron, and the visuals. Of those four, only Theron delivers. Take her part out and this film is complete rubbish. I can't honestly recommend this to anyone.",1347321600,29,2162,4.386533665835412

4755807,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Overall it was enjoyable to watch knowing we were watching a dark tale.  I thought the imagery surrounding the wicked Queen Ravenna was done well (her whole look gets darker as the movie progresses) and some of the effects were interesting, such as the mirror and when she transformed back into human form from her ravens.  I felt there were several areas the story didn't explain too well, like when Snow White asked the Huntsman to escort her to the Duke.  It took me awhile to actually figure out who that was supposed to be (and why was he so far away?).  I mean, I knew William and his father got away, but I didn't know he was the Duke.  Hubby thought William was her brother initially.... And as beautiful as the animal gathering scene was in the sanctuary, it was not well explained either.

I don't want to spoil anything, but I lacked closure at the end of the movie!  I have no idea if Snow White knew who's kiss woke her up or which guy she chooses (she has to pick one, right?!).  The visual aspect was great but the story and characters could have been built up more.  It was probably the first time I didn't really feel connected to Snow White.  I didn't feel strongly when she was poisoned.  Really the only character I came to care about was the Hunstman!  The movie lacked the depth and character development I prefer, but it was still enjoyable to watch.  I still need to see the extended version - maybe I will like that better?

Kristen Stewart can not act , maybe it was telling since she didn't speak much during the movie. Since she was the title character one would think she would have more lines.- wonder if she was cast for the name / Twilight fans she would bring to the box office. The pacing of the movie was horrible, it dragged on and when there was an interesting scene it was rushed. There were animated fairies  which ruined the medieval  vibe it went for in the begnning.

Movie had potential, but the acting, directing is painful

Chris Hemsworth as the drunken, washed-up huntsman was also believable.  Still we could have had a bit more back-story to show us about losing his wife and why he turned drunken and washed-up.
Kristen Stewart...enough said about her already and I agree with all the negative reviews of her performance.
The 3 things needed to improve this film?
1. Get a better actress to play Snow White.  You know, someone who can actually act instead of someone who looks like a constipated person trying to have a bowel movement.  Someone who can deliver a rallying speech that is actually coherent and makes you feel motivated.  No, I'm not a Kristen Stewart hater.  In fact, I've seen her in a couple of movies where she was very good.  Of course, that was before she became a ""star"" and was when she was playing a supporting role.  She was a very good actress in those movies.
2. Get better writers.  Again, the rallying speech.  I had to back up and listen to it again.  Yep, it's still random words strung together that make little or no sense.  And the evil queen could have been so much better if she'd had REAL dialog to work with.  Heck, every character could have been epic with proper dialog and a less strung-out story.  The story scattered after Snow White escapes.  Who are the scarred women?  How did they manage to build their village and survive?  Who knows, because the writers obviously didn't think we would need to know mundane things like that.  And what was up with the troll scene?  Where exactly does this fit into the story?  Because it certainly didn't go anywhere or add to the movie in any way.
3. Get a better director.  And once again with the rallying speech.  Can someone honestly say the director saw that scene and said, ""Yes, that's what I want!""  Because if he actually thought that was great acting, he needs to get a new job.  Maybe as a dog-walker.  I normally don't pay attention to directing.  Then again, I've never seen anything this badly directed before.  There was no consistency in this movie.  One scene would be delivered with breath-taking beauty and spell-binding acting and the next would come up like a club and smack you in the head with it's wooden-ness.  As I said, if the director looked at his finished product and felt proud, he really needs to get another job.
All in all, I don't feel I wasted my money buying the movie.  The few good points are so spectacular they make up for the glaringly bad points.",1347062400,9,2656,4.526315789473684
4756004,1,B005LAIHSQ,"Firstly for those people who found the preview alluring let me warn you this ""action packed movie"" spends more time blankly focusing on Kristin Stewart making all the same ridiculous facial expressions she did in the twilight movies. The plot started off as a promising one , but quickly they get caught up in trying to create beautiful eye catching scenes rather than actually telling a story. The movie earned the one star but Charlize Theron and Liam Hemsworth both did a great job.",1347062400,11,485,4.785714285714286
4756005,3,B005LAIHSQ,"I love the direction this film takes in telling a much darker version of the Snow White tale.  The production values are top notch and it looks fantastic.  Charlize Theron is outstanding as the wicked stepmother.  The back story she's given to justify her actions made her three dimensional and far more than a stock fairytale character.  The story also takes some terrific new directions and twists while still staying loyal to the original story, particulary in regard to how the dwarves come into play, how Snow is ultimately presented with the poisoned apple and the magical kiss she receives near the end.  These were terrific new twists and I loved where the story was going...but it just didn't seem to go far enough.

There's a huge problem with pacing.  An enormous section lags in the middle when Snow and the Huntsman are wandering through the woods.  This seems to go on FOREVER, while the most interesting character, the queen is off-screen for FAR too long.  While Hemsworth is terrific and perfectly cast in his role, he's given virtually nothing to do but be Snow's chaperone through the whole story.  He's a great actor, and his character is given a solid backstory but it's never fully implemented into the plot.  Likewise, we're led to believe the Huntsman and Snow have developed a certain depth to their relationship by the end but there is absolutely NO evidence to support this change of heart.  Nothing.  The prince of the kindgom, overthrown by the wicked queen, is also trying to find Snow in the woods.  He loved her in his childhood and is desperately trying to locate her.  There was a TERRIFIC opportunity here to create a love triangle between the prince, huntsman and Snow that was completely ignored.

Lastly, the biggest drawback of the film is Stewart.  Everything this girl does is delivered in a deadpan, disaffected tone with eyes hanging at half-staff.  She is so flat on screen and exudes ZERO energy that the times she's on screen (85% of the time), the move's momentum grinds to a hault.  It's VERY difficult to watch her and stay engaged because it seems, she's not either.

Having said that, I'd still recommend it for the clever twists, Theron and Hemsworth's performances and some of the most gorgeous productions values I've seen in quite a while.  I loved where this film was headed but it seemed that the screenplay needed a couple of more drafts, a tightening of the story and more character development.  It's like they went ahead and filmed a first draft script.",1346976000,4,2514,4.784222737819025
4756006,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Well, where to begin.
We all understand this is the classic story of the young girl imprisoned by her evil stepmother and blah blah blah.  That, in and of itself, might be a reason to give this movie a miss, even though Charlize Theron is quite good as the evil queen.  It is nonetheless a tale which has been told countless times in one form or another and there is nothing new or remarkable about this telling.

The biggest problem here is Kristen Stewart who, for the most part, makes her way through the movie looking as though she has a bad case of hemorrhoids.  Her acting is wooden, unengaging and she brings nothing to the character that I could connect with.  She spends the entire film with a pouty look on her face which changes only slightly as she segues from one near-disaster to another.  There is no breadth or depth to her character.  In fairness to Stewart, her acting might be the result of poor direction, but whatever the reason she is just not very good.

The film is beautifully filmed and has the usual dose of special effects, especially for the villains.  Unfortunately, the special effects seemed a bit out of place with some of the villains looking like they had been borrowed from the set of a science fiction film.  I think special effects are over-rated but in this film they seemed somewhat out of place.

Save your money.  Rent it if you must, but it is not worthy of a place on anyone's shelf.",1346976000,3,1427,4.467181467181467
4756007,5,B005LAIHSQ,"So I have read most of the reviews for this and can mostly agree with others. However, Miss Stewart aside, watching movies is about escaping the everyday (no jobs, rotten economy yadda yadda) and this movie, despite it's flaws, does just that. I own this movie and am proud of it. I have watched it three times already and find more about it each time. The best part about watching this movie, is you don't have to think ""what's this meaning or What are they trying to get across"" messages. I hate messages. I am here to watch entertainment. It's not a Disney version, that's for sure. All sunshine and smiles can get sickly after a while.

Kristen is quite good in this movie she still is very dpressed in the way she acts but I think more people in the reviews are hating on her due to the Robert pattenson fiasco and not really revieing the acting within this movie. Girls, Rob will be fine im sure : )

4756010,2,B005LAIHSQ,"SPOILER ALERT

The trailers were so lush and beautiful, you really expected an epically grand tale to be told here. And while the costumes, sets, and scenery were all breathtaking, the plot fell flat. Hard.

Charlize Theron was lovely and psychotic, but everyone else was... bland. Kristen Stewart? Please. She is nowhere near as beautiful as Theron, let alone MORE beautiful. It's obvious the producers were banking on riding her ""Twilight"" tails and hoping Twi-hard fans would fill the theater. And while I enjoy Stewart as an actress, she is somewhat one-dimensional; she does well with dark, gritty, angsty movies. She's too sulky and reserved to make an endearing or likeable Snow White, even a tough one. Compare her with Lily Collins (""Mirror, Mirror"") who was both ridiculously beautiful AND exquisitely charming... there IS no comparison.

There also seemed to be this wanna-be love triangle thingie between Snow White, the Huntsman, and William (Snow's childhood sweetheart/friend). But it never goes anywhere. Nobody falls in love with anybody. Nobody winds up with anybody. It didn't make sense. There's all this gazing and sighing and romantic introspection, and then... that's it. Huh?

By the way, what is the white plaster-of-Paris stuff that Theron bathes in? Yes, it's striking and beautiful to watch, but WHAT is it? Milk? It's too thick and coating to be milk. Not sure what else it COULD be...

In the end, the movie dragged on too long, tried to follow too many mini-plots (the Duke, the rebels, the dwarves, the fairy-critters, the scarred-face women), and ultimately felt exhausting and predictable. We know the fairy tale too well to be surprised by anything. I wished they'd veered away from the story everyone knows and thrown in some surprises. Somewhere. Something. Please! I still had about an hour of the film left, and I already knew what was coming; Snow White would fight the Queen, kill her, become Queen herself, happily ever after, tada. I was ready to turn it off at that point. Why watch the rest if I already knew what would happen?

Sometimes a so-so movie is still entertaining enough that I'd say ""go ahead and watch it, just for the fun factor"". But I can't even say that about this one. Skip it and watch ""Mirror, Mirror"" instead. That movie was another disappointment, but at least it was fun to watch.",1346716800,5,2348,4.931645569620253

So, I waited for it to come out of the theaters. I finally watched it the other night, and I wished I had not listened to the negative reviews. It was a good movie. It had its flaws & some slow parts, but even during the slow parts there was great scenery to enjoy! I look forward to the rumored sequels.",1346716800,4,457,4.032967032967033
4756012,2,B005LAIHSQ,"This was a really boring Thor movie. Oh, wait. It wasn't a Thor movie? That explains why he wasn't using Mjolnir. Go ahead and waste two hours watching this - I did. The best part's of this movie were, of course, the villain. Charlize Theron tried so hard to make her character good n' scary, but the dialogue was too...dumb. But she was still the only interesting character on the screen. The CGI was really good. Actually, the CGI was the best actor in the whole film. I think that they should animate Kristen Stewart's upper lip - because it doesn't do anything.",1346630400,3,565,4.495145631067961
4756103,2,B005LAIHSQ,"This $170 million 'reimagining' of the Brothers Grimm classic is thin, unnecessary and painfully slow. Theron delivers the 'Disney acting guide to being an evil queen', alternatively over-acting and screaming while preening for all the CG airbrushing shots. Stewart provides her normal mouth-open stare that's somewhere between slightly stoned and trying to find the reset button - it's hard to remember that she's supposed to be the fairest of the them all. And then there are the dwarves, a CG shortening of regular actors, that are intended to provide comic relief but come across as strange and creepy.

Almost nothing in the script works very well. It starts very, very slowly, failing to build any real tension throughout, and the ending is foreshadowed so plainly from Act 1 that it couldn't have been more obvious. There are several set piece scenes that do nothing for the plot, the worst of which is a shiny fruit bowl that's supposed to be the mirror. Whereas the mirror in Shrek was a clever reworking of the Disney mirror, this mirror is like the fairy tale version of the T-1000 but without the same quality finish, and after two appearances is never mentioned again in the film. The same is true with the scene where Snow White tames a troll - after a fairly substandard fight sequence, she mysteriously becomes Snow the Troll Whisperer for absolutely no point whatsoever.

Even the story logic is really dreadful. The queen's brother tells the Huntsman that the queen can't bring his dead wife back to life at *exactly* the point where he should have said nothing. The queen fears the Dead Forest at the beginning but quite happily goes there later in the film. There are creepy asexual sprites hiding in the birds for no reason at all. It's a collection of ideas that don't gel or work together to move anything forward. ** Possible spoiler ** The finale is one of the worst I can remember with Snow White killing the queen in the most banal, simplistic way with no help from any of the characters she meets throughout - after two hours of the queen showing off her 'mad spellmaking skillz', she lets an overly-armored Snow White just walk up and finish her off. I was literally screaming at the TV in disbelief when this happened!

Finally, the film struggles to find a tone throughout. It's Joan of Arc meets Lord of the Rings somewhere in The Neverending Story but leaves the viewer realizing that Lord of the Rings is an incredibly well-made film and this is an excuse to extract $10. The world created here is devoid of any charm or magic and creates no lasting impression - and actually, that's not just the CG world but really the feeling I had about the whole movie. What a huge disappointment.",1346630400,8,2719,4.707983193277311

This was definitely a much different look at the Snow White story. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth did an amazing job in their roles within the movie. Both actors made me believe that they were their characters and they did a great job at this altogether. Kristin Stewart on the other hand would not have been my pick for her character. Not that she didn't fit the role, she did, but whether she was believable in this role she really was not in my perspective (but I would say similar things to her portrayal in the Twilight series as well). Overall, the movie was engaging and though darker than other fairy tale movies, it was action packed and fun.

The only watchable character is the guy from Thor, then rest of the actors almost didn't need to even be there. Someone could have filmed the queens character pacing the halls of her castle for two hours and the movie would have made just as much sense.

Frankly, she is abysmal, and cannot even deliver her lines in a way to make you feel anything towards her character other than dislike.  Stewart made this film difficult to watch at times, and to be quite honest, it is hard to believe she could ever be fairer than Theron.  Theron was amazing, and I think if they had shortened the film and found a different actress to play Snow White, it would have done much better, but overall I found so many parts of it rather dull or a let down.  I was actually just waiting for the film to be over while watching it in the theater.  There was great potential here, but it did not deliver.",1346198400,15,777,4.324137931034483
4756109,1,B005LAIHSQ,"I'll admit, the theatrical trailer made this movie seem exciting and worthwhile, however, the actual movie experience was a major let down. The film itself seemed to drag on without a deep plot to justify the additional length. It felt like the film could have ended 30 to 45 minutes sooner than it did with the second half of the film being a chore just to get through. Additionally, while I thought Kristen Stewart would show some improved acting outside of the Twilight series, this film proved to me once again that she is a C- actress at best. There's a scene near the end of the film where Stewart gives an impassioned plea to rally the troops for a final battle. However, her poor acting skills were only magnified by this scene with Stewart being so overly dramatic to the point where it was just ridiculous. In fact, several people in the theater actually busted out in laughter during this scene. I'm sure the director did multiple cuts of this scene and if this was the best they could get out of Stewart then she has no hope of ever becoming an elite actress.",1346198400,154,1071,4.4974358974358974
4756110,4,B005LAIHSQ,"This lavish, entertaining fantasy adaptation of Grimms' fairy tale from first-time feature director Rupert Sanders is a huge upgrade from the frivolous Julia Roberts film ""Mirror, Mirror.""

Kristen Stewart is Snow in this dark, compelling version fashioned by writers Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. In their decidedly serious take on the subject, Snow's father is murdered by her new stepmother (Charlize Theron), who promptly imprisons his daughter until she's able to break free and seek refuge in the dark forest. Needing her back, alive, Theron's Queen sends a washed-up huntsman (""Thor""'s Chris Hemsworth) after her, though he questions her motivations -- as well as his own -- after he runs into the young heroine.

Happily eschewing the CGI'd green-screen approach of so many other, recent genre films, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" benefits enormously from its real-world UK location shooting. The film looks like an actual, lived-in environment, and its ""realistic"" visuals are matched by equally strong performances, especially from Theron (in one of her juiciest roles) and Hemsworth, who does some nice work in a scene with the cursed Snow late in the film. For her part, Stewart does as much with the character of Snow White as the script allows - I bought her in Snow's empathetic scenes with the natural world, but she doesn't really have much to do in comparison with the other leads. There are also the dwarves, here played by a collection of character actors CGI'd to smaller proportions (Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane and Ray Winstone among them), but the film doesn't do nearly enough with that concept as it should have.

The plot itself is surprisingly rich and traditional - not in terms of it being a fairy tale, but rather an old-fashioned cinematic fantasy-adventure - and is backed by impressive cinematography, costumes, and a satisfying mix of character and action. Sanders draws you in and lets the film breathe, and while there are CGI beasts, the film's emotional draw is human - rather than technical - in nature, and ends on a particularly satisfying beat (with a robust James Newton Howard score). Even more satisfying than the likes of ""Willow"" and ""Dragonslayer,"" this ""Snow White"" is a surprisingly good ""revisionist"" take of the oft-told tale on nearly every level.

Universal brings ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" to Blu-Ray on September 11th in a combo pack featuring both the theatrical version and a slightly extended, 132-minute unrated cut. Extra features are fairly light - just a few making Of featurettes and commentary are on-hand - but the transfer (1080p AVC) is terrific, as is the DTS MA audio. A DVD and digital copy (both Ultraviolet and standard itunes-variety) are also included.",1346025600,10,2751,5.093126385809312

I like Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth and although I'd heard bad things about Kristen Stewart's acting, I'd never seen any movie she was in so I was hopeful that perhaps rumors of her poor acting had been exaggerated.  Sadly, they were not.  She was truly awful and if this woman is supposed to inspire a kingdom with her beauty and charm, I just didn't see it.  And although she may have had an affair with the director, the editor clearly didn't see it either and she had a very limited speaking role.  Most of her part involved being silent and expressing emotion non-verbally, of which she seems incapable.  Unfortunately, even Charlize Theron, who I hoped would save the film, was awful in this.  Her Queen tended to drone, with every word overly-enunciated as if spoken by a high school thespian.  I think this was supposed to give her character gravitas but instead it gave the impression of overacting.  Chris Hemsworth was good as a man haunted by the death of his wife but even he could not convince me that Snow White was worth believing in.  Plus, as others have mentioned,**SPOILER ALERT***the fact that his kiss awakened Snow White was a plot twist that made zero sense.**END SPOILER ALERT**  I cannot possibly imagine what in this movie was inspiring enough to spawn the apparently impending Snow White and the Huntsman 2, but this is one moviegoer who learned her lesson the first time.

Unfortunately, the lack of a good script, terrible acting from Kristen Stewart, and funky, creepy dwarfs ruined it. There was no chemistry between Snow White and the huntsman - the characterization was glazed over at best. We're told Snow could inspire people to follow her, but why? Kristen Stewart does her usual fly-catching, mouth-open, blank-eyed gawping about - nothing about her portrayal of the character would inspire anyone to do anything but find something else to watch. I didn't expect or want silly dwarfs, but these guys were just dirty and creepy and weird, like little pedos. The huntsman had the most potential to be an interesting character, but his dialogue quickly ran out of steam. The evil queen and her brother were the best characters, but not enough to pull this stinker out of the hole. I would have been so happy if this was still a flawed but fun movie, but unfortunately, I couldn't wait for it to be over. A big disappointment.
Update: I watched this again and bumped it up a star. On the second viewing, I liked it better. I still wish they'd given Snow White a LOT more personality and dialogue, but those visuals are worth an extra star.",1345766400,33,1243,4.732718894009216

--Some of the background stories were vague and confusing.
--The Huntsman ""awakens"" Snow White and before she bites the apple she claims the prince is her ""true love"".
--Kristen at times acts well, but in some scenes she looks distant and uninteresting.
--The Huntsman is a lonely drunkard who longs to be with his dead wife, but instantly becomes sober and strong and in love with Snow White.
--The movie is very dark and cold.

Charlize Theron was an even better Evil Queen. But like many other people have noted, her performance is a little over dramatic at times and I couldn't help but giggle (yes, giggle) at her extremeness.

Snow White and the Huntsman is the latest to be adapted into a live action, but this time with quite a big twist. The film takes on a Lord of the Rings feel, bringing it a dark style, but ultimately one we've seen many times before. Kristen Stewart as Snow White is predictably wooden in her performance, making the fact that she is highest paid actress in the world completely absurd. Chris Hemsworth is adequate, with the script and style doing nothing for him besides giving him a pay check. By far the star of the film is Charlize Theron, owning the role of The Queen with her performance. However, the whole film screamed of mediocre, taking the `best bits' from other similar films. Even though I was watching the film in Gold Class with unlimited popcorn and wine, it didn't make watching the film any more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the film is likely to remembered more for the affair between Stewart and Sanders than the film itself. Casting couch anyone?

SWATH is not only a rebuke to those who cast aspersions on Kristen Stewart's acting, but a powerful demonstration that a woman can carry a fantasy/action movie just fine, thanks.  Snow is amazing, and while her partnership (however you want to see it) with the Huntsman is one of the most wonderful, understated parts of the movie (again, SO hard to find, and so good), *nothing that she does is for him*.

4756292,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Does anyone remember back when rival Hollywood studios were putting out similar movies around the same time and there was the rush to get theirs out first thinking that the first one would take the majority of the box office?  I remember ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano"" duking it out in this way, and especially ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"".  ""Deep Impact"" came out first but ""Armageddon"" sunk it at the box office because ""Armageddon"" was a boffo summer blockbuster popcorn flick with lots of edge of your seat action and big, splashy special effects.  ""Deep Impact"" suffered because it was marketed much in the same way but it was a substantially different movie; it was a female-centeric drama that centered on the end of the world.  Likewise this year with two new movies about the story of Snow White.  ""Mirror Mirror"", which came out before ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", suffered at the box office even though it hit first but not because it wasn't a special effects movie or a drama; it came in second between these two because it was geared and marketed toward a smaller niche (pre- and adolescent teenage girls) and was made to be a smaller movie both in scope and tone (comedy).  ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a big summer popcorn movie with great special effects and some decent sword and sandal action along with doses of magic (both black and white).  ""Mirror Mirror"" succeeded at what it was trying to do and was a fine and enjoyable movie but it was never going to match the moneymaking ability of this Snow White (and the stories between the two are very similar, unlike in the previous asteroid fests).

SWATH stars a radiant Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna who has lived for centuries and has been moving from kingdom to kingdom inserting herself by dispatching kings in seductive and nefarious ways in order to take over their kingdoms.  She doesn't really like men and she's evil as evidenced by her attraction to earth tones and black.  That, and she sucks the lifeforce out of other women (guess she doesn't really like women either).  She has a twin brother, Finn, an almost albino sychophant that serves her because she keeps him young and powerful.  The story gives you the slightest backstory for her, enough to make you go ""That's why she turned out so awful?"" but not enough for you to really sympathize with her...because she's such a witch.  The other two main stars are Kristen Stewart as the eponymous Snow White (merely adequate, sorry all you ""Twilight"" fans) and Chris Hemsworth (the guy who plays ""Thor"") as the huntsman.  Hemsworth shows off some acting chops in a few scenes where he chews and spits out his dialogue like he was born to play a medieval ruffian (must be all of that ""Thor"" norse god work he'd done) and he gives you plenty of reason to root and cheer for him (he lost his lady; he doesn't like himself because he knows what type of person he is) while Stewart mostly runs around the forests and castle looking a little stunned.  At the end when she gives her speech rousing the rebel villagers it...wasn't...that...well, rousing.  If there had been no musical cues for the audience and the villagers they just might have looked at her and slowly turned away.  In some minor roles (and by minor I mean they were dwarfs) some mega good actors showed up: Ian McShane; Bob Hoskins; Ray Winstone; Nick Frost; Brendan Gleeson.  I recognized many of them and then, knowing that they weren't actual dwarfs and I was watching special effects, I focused on the special effects unfortunately.  They did a great acting job and I'm not kidding that they could turn a middling movie into a stellar outing; I'd watch a movie about these seven dwarves sans Snow White and the evil queen.  It would be awesome!  Fortunately for us this movie is much better than middling.  There is a very good narrative flow to the movie, likable and sympathetic characters, despicable characters for us to root against, some light action sequences, and plenty of magic afoot along with a few mystical creatures.  The love triangle, not terribly played up thankfully, between Snow White and her youthful friend turned fiery bowman warrior (William) and the huntsman was a little distracting especially because it was not resolved.  For myself (a dude) I was split between which of the warriors I wanted to see get the girl; I liked them both and felt bad that one of them was going to get their heart broke but this fairy tale ended too soon so we never got to see whom Snow White picks...but you can see it in her eyes.  You know.

SWATH was very enjoyable and very well done.  I actually give it 4.5 stars.",1342396800,7,4642,4.663803680981595
4756362,1,B005LAIHSQ,"half of the characters are pointless.  the writing and direction is an absolute joke.  the storyline makes zero sense.

4756363,2,B005LAIHSQ,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie. My mom and I went and saw it in the theatre, unsure of what to think of it. About the first 45 minutes were awesome; very beautifully filmed, with good action and decent acting. Once Snow White and the Huntsman had been traveling together for about ten minutes, however, my mind started to throb with agonizing boredom. The story moved incredibly slow, with bad acting--loved Hemsworth as THOR, & he was good in this role, though the script fairly SUCKED, and Stewart is the most horrible actress I've ever seen, being the top-paid one in Hollywood for one (ugly) expression--though Theron was good, even if most of her monologues turned into meaningless rambling.

When are we ever going to get a STRONG HEROINE???? (Buffy, please come back!!!) Snow White spends most of the movie running around w/ the Huntsman through the woods, and getting scared at trees and vines. When we meet the dwarves (some of the most entertaining characters in the movie) we keep getting told that Snow White is special, and the one to end the war, yaddy-yaddy-yadda. The aforementioned war took forever to get around to actually happening. In between, there was a TERRIBLE attempt at romance--bad love triangles follow Stewart around everywhere--and it was never even solved, even if the Huntsman's kiss brought Snow back to life after eating the apple. Once we got to the war, Snow White dressed in armor and carried a sword--since when did she learn how to wield one?--and runs into the castle while all the men fight behind her & tries to kill the Queen. When she finally does, she tells her blandly that she can't have her heart (apparently the Queen needed it to keep herself young & beautiful... Not that Snow is prettier than her, something I think just about EVERYONE noticed)... and then she sits down and starts CRYING. She seems to feel SORRY for the Queen. The woman who would have killed her without a second thought, stole her childhood & stuffed her up in a tower for most of her life... Snow CRIES over her. And, being the bad actress that she is, Kristen Stewart didn't even cry believably.

However, I can't be ALL mean. Most of the time, the filming was beautiful, and the action scenes were reasonably good, if pointless. The glass soldiers were cool.

I don't want to be mean to the actors either. Kristen Stewart could probably do well in SOMETHING, if only she'd be in a movie with a good script, and start to be more expressive.

I usually don't like to be this critical. But this movie was sooooooooooooooo slow-moving and mind-numbingly boring... And it could've been so much better.",1342310400,27,2634,4.73202614379085
4756364,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Overall, the movie was pretty good. The special effects were stunning. This revision of Disney's Snow White has a dark side to it, but interesting none the less. The costumes and scenery were breathtaking. The pure evilness of the Queen is clearly displayed in this version, an aspect not seen before.

The flow of the story at times seemed abrupt. Stewart's performance was adequate, showing very little emotional variance. It was interesting to see Hemsworth as a character other than his acclaimed role of THOR. It was refreshing to see a heroine take charge rather than the usual ""Prince Charming saves the day"" scenario. I would like to have seen Stewart's character involved in more fighting scenes, especially when she confronts the Queen.

One aspect I really did not like was the ending because it left you hanging. Personally speaking, there should have been some sort of epilogue following the conclusion of the film. Never the less, it was an entertaining movie.",1342137600,5,974,5.006172839506172

They did some different twists from the orginial but it went with the storyline. Charlize Theron, all I can say is WOW she was the perfect actress for that role because she can be bold and was just incredible. Ive read the other reviews about Kristen Stewart being really bad but in my opinion she did a great job in this role as Snow White. Everyone is always talking about her role in Twilight and how awful she plays in those in which I disagree. If she was so untalented then why do people go and watch them and love those movies?

4756368,5,B005LAIHSQ,"Problem: When one speaks of ""beauty"", people tend to forget that ""beauty"" is both external and ""internal"". Perhaps Snow White's purity created her overall beauty. Charlize is one of those rare women who seem to ""glow"" with little or no effort. There was one movie, she played a roadside pro, (maybe ""Beast"") in love with another woman... they had to go to great lengths to make her (Charlize) look that bad. Beauty is not skin deep.
Perhaps Chalize's character realized that she did indeed, need both.

Overall, anyone can pick at the little things ""that annoyed them"" about the film. And some insist on writng disertations. I wish people would only review the overall ""quality"" of the entire movie. Don't spoil it for others who have not seen it, by critiquing nearly all of the important (or not) scenes.

It was an adventure and it managed to pull the more important emotions from me. That and it's quality, overall, made for an entertaining film. I would heartily recommend it to any adult. Enough so, that I will add it to my movie library.

4756369,4,B005LAIHSQ,"WARNING: This is not your typical Snow White fairytale. It is an awesomely dark version of the story with unexpected twists (twists that you may or may not be okay with) I won't spoil it for you, you will just have to watch it to find out! Yes, it took me a while to see her as Snow White instead of a Twilight character but once I was able to do so, I realized how well she played this part. And Thor, I mean the Huntsman, did a fantastic job in his role as well. A TAD bit of storyline and dialogue was missing from the film but it got a star back for it's amazing cinematography and graphics. The visual aspect of the film was incredibily artistic and breathtaking. It has action, a few jokes, and a tiny bit of romance. That was the only thing that made me groan at the end; the lack of romance. If you're not a sap you won't care. But I was hoping for a good make out scene. lol. You may not want to own it, as I surely will, but I would definitely reccommend watching it once for the pure enjoyment.

P.S I am tempted however to dock a star because of K. Stewart. She is supposed to be playing the most innocent purest girl and she couldn't be more on the opposite side of the spectrum. She couldn't even finish the movie without cheating with the married producer of Snow White. Not to mention that dirty little mouth of hers. So yes it shouldn't matter, but her personal life interferes with the experience for me. Annoyed...",1341446400,4,1433,4.192028985507246
4756370,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Hollywood doesn't do these very often and that alone is enough to coax many movie viewers to go see ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". A true sign of that is the epic performance of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies and the giddiness in many that a ""Hobbit"" trailer foretells of another. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is no ""Lord of the Rings"", but a more fair comparison would be to a movie like ""Legend"". It isn't perfect, but it is without question a worthy addition to the short list of fantasy adventure movies that Hollywood sometimes backs.

""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has many qualities but the most standout one of those, even above the knockout special effects, is the performance of Oscar winner Charlize Theron (""Monster"", ""Reindeer Games""). She is haunting in her portrayal of the evil Queen Raveena. Like every great actress does, she took her role and made it hers, unique and hypnotizing. The torment that she goes through to remain on top of the spell she has been saddled with is something you can't take your eyes off. Theron is having a big time summer, because next week she'll appear in ""Prometheus"".

""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is also gifted with amazing special effects. The images and cinematography of the film rival that of ""Legend"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" easily. Although there are moments where, as the band who are protecting Snow White travel, I couldn't help but think of ""Lord of the Rings"" and that's never a good thing. The sweeping sceneries and orchestra music were too similar to ""Rings"". This can be overlooked because it is so fleeting.

Kristen Stewart (""Twilight"", ""Zathura"", ""Panic Room"") plays Snow White and as much as I wasn't sure of her acting abilities, I'm more confident now that she's capable. Sometimes I feel she leaves her urgency and emotion behind and maybe that's a sign of a person who started acting when she was nine. An acting career was sort of put at her footstep before she knew how to achieve it. She is twenty-two now and has been in many successful films. There are moments in the film that are a little over dramatized as she works soldiers into frenzy like Joan of Arc, but all in all, she was ""Snow White"" and she did the movie justice.

""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is certainly not perfect and it is certainly not going to be one of the most talked about movies of the summer. Yet, in a summer full of superheroes, aliens and talking teddy bears, it is the only adventure fantasy until ""The Hobbit"" comes along in December. If you enjoy movies with mythical creatures, unstoppable evil's and heroes emerging, then ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" might just be a good fit for you.",1341446400,5,2651,4.634042553191489
4756371,4,B005LAIHSQ,"""Evil"" Queen Ravenna (played by actress Charlize Theron) seems to get more air time than Snow White, and this movie should rightfully named after the Queen! Snow White gets to don about 3 costumes throughout the movie, while I couldn't keep up with Queen Ravenna's dazzling wardrobe collection.

I've noted that until the time Snow White is about to be summoned to be killed, the Queen must have had provided excellent dental care and a cosmetic consultant to attend to Snow White even though the latter was locked up in a tower. Snow White had all the time in the world to wax and shape her pristine eyebrows! She has nice curled eyelashes too. Wow! You didn't think I'll miss that, did you? Snow White has polished finger-nails, all cut, prim and proper, no long nails despite her years in jail. Good hygiene there! Oh, at least, the movie makeup artists did try to fill in some dirt on the sides of her finger-nails! Ha ha!

What I like about about this movie:

(1) Everything about actress Charlize Theron! She's hot!

(2) Kristen Stewart's hot too and plays Snow White well!
  Kristen Stewart's acting has improved tremendously since that boring
  ""Twilight"" series! Then again, Kristen is naturally sexy, all the cameras
  needed to do was zoom in on her pretty face. Nothing more needs to be said!

(3) Luxurious costumes, especially the Queen's!

(4) Captivating background scenes.

(5) Good graphics.

What I don't like about this movie:

(1) That comical kissing scene between the Huntsman (played by actor Chris
  Hemsworth) and the dead Snow White (played by Kristen Stewart). In this
  scene, the Huntsman said something like ""you remind me of my wife"".... I
  almost burst out laughing in the cinema! He could very well be saying:
  ""Little Snow White, you look like my little sister! Let's just hope you don't
  transmit any cold sores or viruses from remnants of that poison apple when I
  kiss you on your lips!""

(2) lack of sufficient battle scenes.

(3) cheesy and unrealistic battle scenes: eg. King Magnus hastily charging
  into the battle formation of Queen Ravenna's phantom troops. Reminds me of
  Iceni Queen Boudica's tribal charge against the Roman legions of her day.

Here's my advice to the Queen as a prospective Royal Advisor: don't kill too many innocent people, especially children, bad karma on that one. Try botox treatments from a licensed medical practitioner and the latest nano-tech cosmetics. Should do you just fine!

Here's a sneak peek at the next Kristen Stewart Blockbuster!

Kristen Stewart dons just about any costume, eyelashes and foundation all glowing.

The camera zooms in on her pretty face.

She sighs.

She says nothing.

She breathes.

The camera zooms in on her rising bosom and her face.

The camera zooms and pans out.

Kristen flicks her hair back.

She looks into the camera and bats her eyelashes.

Soft classical music plays in the background.

Kristen smiles into the camera - at you.

Nothing is said - for 2 whole hours.

The blockbuster ends.

We then nominate Kristen as the Best Lead Actress for the Golden Globe Awards!

4756522,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Umm...I don't wanna be ""that guy"", you know, the guy who insists that a movie exactly follow the book, or fairy tale, from wich it was drawn, but still: isn't Snow White supposed to be PRETTIER than the evil witch?",1341360000,5,214,4.375
4756523,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White and the Huntsman is one of those films that leaves you wondering how they managed to get so much brilliantly right, coming so close to being a classic, and yet fall short because of baffling flaws that threaten to sink it like a lead weight.

On the brilliant side, you start with the highly ambitious script by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. They flesh out the story of Snow White by not only drawing on the variant versions of the original fairy tale for extra detail but also by adding in background elements to give depth and reality to the world in which it takes place, where reality and magic are inextricably linked and the rise and fall of innocence affect the very land itself. Thus this Snow White is both magical and epic in scale and consequence, far above the simple tale related by the Brothers Grimm.  The characters are themselves equally fleshed out, most particularly the evil queen, who sets a new standard by which all other fairy tale evil queens will hence be measured.  For the first time, the evil queen - Ravenna by name in this case - actually comes with a back story, not only for how she actually became queen but also for why she came to be evil in the first place. You may not sympathize with her, but her behavior becomes much more understandable when you see how she came to where she is at the time of the story. Also brought into greater depth are the Huntsman and the Prince (in this case a duke's son) and the roles they play in Snow White's ultimate fate.

And most brilliant of all is Charlize Theron's portrayal of Ravenna. She transforms herself on the screen like the chameleon Ravenna is, going from seeming helpless captive to enchanting beauty to imperious queen, only letting her cold ruthlessness and deadly intensity show through when it suits her purpose. Theron does with a glance or a turn of the head, or even just the way she walks across a room, what lesser actors would take lines of dialogue to convey.

Another big plus is the cinematography and the art design, making the settings both realistic and yet fitting backdrops for a fairy tale at the same time. The way the enchanted forest is done here stands as superior to any that I've seen in any other film, truly magical and full of wonder. And then there's their truly original take on the Magic Mirror, an enormous polished-metal disc of the kind actually used back in ancient and early medieval times instead of the silver-backed glass we're familiar with. And the unique way it came to life to answer the Queen's questions was quite well done and add much to the eerie atmosphere that always seemed to surround Theron's Ravenna. A very nice touch indeed. As was the dark and ominous crown Ravenna ends up wearing when she is queen, the design perfectly suited to project a combination of power and ruthless resolve.

Of all the things weighing the film down however, Kristen Stewart's Snow White unfortunately tops the list. Part of this - the way the character was written - is admittedly not her fault. The acting however - or rather the lack thereof - is. Stewart's performance belongs to the Keannu Reeves' one-facial-expression-for-the-entire-film school of acting. Worse still, it's the same facial expression she used through the entire Twilight series, as if she wandered off the set for those films and onto the set for this one, stopping only for a costume change. And her limitations become more pronounced as the script demands greater and less plausible things of the character, most particularly Snow White as a fairy tale Joan Of Arc.  This was one of the really hard to swallow even for a fairy tale moments: a princess, who's spent most of her childhood locked away in a tower, is suddenly donning armor and leading a rebel army into battle with sword and shield (but strangely without a helmet) like a war-hardened veteran?

Another big problem is in the script itself.  While I appreciate the ambitiousness that really added to the early part of the movie, it becomes clear as the film progresses that a number of things were not really thought through and other things were simply bad ideas. I've already mentioned the strange way in which Snow White inexplicably suddenly morphs - not remotely convincingly - into Snow White: Warrior Princess. The seven dwarves, who were key to the original fairy tale, have been reduced to near irrelevance here. You could in fact cut pretty much all of their scenes and it wouldn't affect the basic plot one bit. While the CGI-enhanced actors do a decent job of bringing the dwarves to life, the problem remains that they really have little to do and end up making parts of the movie drag. Another bad idea comes in the form of the ""Curse of Twilight"", i.e. the female hero must have two male counterparts as potential love interests, regardless of how little sense it makes or how awkwardly its handled. The idea to flesh out the Huntsman and the Prince was good, but then taking that and giving them the Twilight treatment really hobbled the movie, particularly as it was not remotely believable. Worse, it was baffling in that it not only messed with the whole fairy tale feel of the story, it led absolutely nowhere and was left like a jarringly unresolved plot thread at the end leaving you wondering what the writers had been thinking. As other reviewers have mentioned, they'd have been far better off going with just combining the characters into one. Add in the fact that Kristen Stewart's one-note Snow White had absolutely no chemistry with either Chris Hemsworth's Hunter or Sam Claflin's Prince William and it just really sucked the air out of a good third of the movie, to the point where you just want Charlize Theron's Ravenna to come back and get things moving once again.

Another problem was Bob Hoskins' head dwarf, Muir.  Hoskins, an actor whose work is generally always excellent, is strangely out of sorts here as his eyes never seemed to focus on anyone or anything. I later learned that apparently Muir is supposed to be blind, but the way it was handled in the film this was never made clear. Assuming this to be true however, then this was one of the worst portrayals of a blind person I've ever seen as nothing else about the way he acted or held his head or moved about rang true to the way real blind people I've known do those things.  It was instead simply baffling as Hoskins went through the movie with this inexplicably vacant and unsettling stare. The only possible excuse I can think of is that this was perhaps due to the way that the CGI-dwarfing of his character was handled which may have resulted in the more physical parts of Hoskins' performance being 'lost in translation' as it were.

A more niggling problem, for me anyway, was the fact that the Huntsman was always armed with - and only with - a double-bladed war ax and a set of throwing axes.  I'm sorry, but even fairy tale huntsmen don't go hunting with axes.  They use bows, knives and traps. One supposes that they didn't let Hemsworth's Huntsman use a bow because Claflin's Prince was already using a bow, but that also doesn't make sense because the nobility didn't go to war with bows.

All of that said though, I still feel Snow White and the Huntsman is worth seeing for the good things it brings to the genre and for Charlize Theron's stand-out performance as Ravenna. Recommended for any fan of retellings of classic fairy tales, of Charlize Theron and for students of why near-great films sometimes end up being pulled down by their flaws.",1341100800,13,7554,4.65990990990991
4756524,3,B005LAIHSQ,"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has everything that would make a great action adventure film, as far as its visuals are concerned. Inspired by the fairy tale everyone knows, the film has great photography, great production designs and great costumes, plus stunning effects. What it does not have is an engaging story, a heroine you relate to, and a director who knows how to tell a story.

Kristen Stewart plays the titular heroine, who escapes from Charlize Theron's evil queen into the dark forest, where she encounters the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth). What follows is their adventures and romance. The film's adventure part is just average with several decent action set-pieces. The film is also supposed to be a love story, but there is no passion throughout the story.

For all the best efforts from the leads, the main characters Snow White and the Huntsman remain uninteresting in this dull and boring in this revisionist take of the fairy tale, which does not know what it really wants to do. Over-the-top Charlize Theron plays Ravenna, whose motive (and method) of taking over the kingdom never convinces. Actually, none of the film's characters are really credible, except supporting characters of digitally rendered dwarfs played by veterans Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones and Ray Winstone.

Modern-day retelling of fairy tales is nothing new. Perhaps you remember ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror,"" (1997) a ""realistic"" take on the famous story. The new version may have better visuals and designs, but sadly the filmmakers have forgotten to polish up the story.",1340928000,3,1561,5.08984375

4756528,4,B005LAIHSQ,"First of all, let me say that I very much enjoyed this movie.  As such a lot of the criticism regarding it seems harsh to me.

This movie is not all that original, but what do you expect from an adaptation of Snow White?  If the writers had gone too far outside canon people would have complained about it taking too many liberties with the original fairytale.

I found most of the actors in the movie to have done a surprisingly good job.  With the exception of Kristen Stewart (who looks to be very bored through the entire film) all the actors seem to be having a good time and are for the most part believable.  I was actually a bit moved by a few of Chris Hemsworth's scenes and found him particularly good in his role.  Could they have done better?  Sure, but again, I wasn't going into this movie expecting some sort of Oscar winning performance.  I was going into it expecting an adaptation of Snow White.

The movie does at times feel a little slow, but it isn't so horrific that you'd want to stop watching, and before you know it the plot is back on track.  I think the slow bits are really due to Stewart's somewhat unconvincing performance, as I found a lot of her scenes to be uninspired.  They really could have chosen someone better for the role of Snow White.

As for the special effects?  I have nothing but good to say about them.  The movie is visually stunning and beautiful to look at.  The score, likewise, is very good.  James Newton Howard hasn't hit the mark like this in a very long time.

On the whole, does this movie have flaws?  Absolutely.  But if you actually go into this film to have a good time and lose yourself in fantasy you'll enjoy it.  I've found that the people who hate this movie are going into it expecting far too much from a simple film.  Enjoy it like a movie-goer and not a movie critic and you'll love it.  Otherwise, you might want to hit up the Academy Award best picture list, because fun little fantasy movies like this are not for you.",1340582400,4,1991,4.321621621621621

Snow White has always been my favorite princess as a child and to see it be remade I can honestly say I prefer this movie to the Disney cartoon version. Kristen Stewart really lived up to the character Snow White and her made her a bad-a**. Charlize Theron made for an incredible evil queen. I really believe both Kristen and Charlize made this movie. I was so amazed by how incredible the visual effects were. I think everyone will enjoy this movie as I did. It's beautiful and epic.

I loved this movie I even went and saw it twice in the theater :) If you are not confident with what I say rent the movie first and then buy it :D,1340496000,2,247,3.6792452830188678
4756531,2,B005LAIHSQ,"This review contains SPOILERS.  You have been warned :)

After seeing the trailer, I thought I might be able to enjoy the movie, despite the fact that Kristen Stewart was playing Snow White. So I went into it thinking, I'll just focus on the story and Chris Hemsworth (whom I greatly enjoyed in Thor and The Avengers).

The story started off oddly, first with the queen thinking she wanted a daughter with skin white as snow and lips red as blood and hair dark as a raven's feathers and then she suddenly had a daughter that would grow up to be that way.  Was she some sort of witch, casting a spell to cause her daughter to be that way? Did a fairy overhear and use magic to make that happen? It just seemed odd to me, especially as the queen plays no real role in the story and Snow White's description could been told to the audience in another way.

I also thought that deus ex machina was envoked once or twice, especially in Snow White's convenient discovery of the nail... I suppose one could argue that her previous actions (from years earlier) were allowing her to find the nail as it was the fairies that live in the bodies of the birds that led her to it... however, what would be wrong with revealing that she has had the nail for years and was just waiting for someone to actually enter her cell in order to use it to make her escape? *shrug*

Snow White's ability to stop a troll's rampage simply been standing in front of it seemed very contrived to me. Now, if this had happened after the fairy-elk-god thing had blessed her, yeah, that might have worked.  Not only would that have explained the troll walking away, but it also would have given the fairy-elk-god-blessing scene a reason for existing.  Maybe I'm just obtuse, but having seen this film only once in theaters I couldn't figure out a time in the movie when the fairy-elk-god's blessing affected anything. Maybe that is why the poison apple does not kill her, but none of that is alluded to in the film, so I am just hypothesizing.

The poison apple was also another point of contention with me.  Not once was it mentioned that Snow White did not in fact die from the apple.  Maybe it was assumed that those in the audience have all seen Disney's Snow White before (which I have, but it has been a long time, so I don't remember the particulars), and thus know this part of the story.  Anyways, I find it amusing that the Huntsman does find a rather convincing way of kissing Snow White (though I don't understand the desire to kiss a dead body's lips, but that's a whole other topic) without having any knowledge that true love's kiss breaks the spell. However, afterward the entire incident is not explained.  Instead Snow White walks out and starts muttering about iron and swords and then incites the crowd into fighting.

All that aside, I did like the way the evil queen deceived the king and the way that Snow White's childhood friend manages to join the riders of the evil queen.

Overall, I did not like it.

Also, what was with the evil queen standing in the fire?  Her clothes and hair did not appear to burn and yet her skin blistered.  I don't claim to know much about burning people, but I'm pretty sure clothes and hair go first. IMO, there was no need to add that to the film when it had nothing to do with the story line or character development.",1340323200,8,3341,4.413680781758957
4756582,3,B005LAIHSQ,"There are things about this movie that were great. But then there were things about this movie that were just not so good or at least could have been much better

The Good

The acting: Hemsworth did exceptionally well. He was really the best thing about this entire movie. Theron did a very good job as the queen as well and the majority of the other actors (especially the dwarves) had a very good performance as well.

CG: The special effects were great. From the phantom armies to the environment, this movie did a great job of portraying a mystical land full of danger and beauty

Environment: Costumes and landscape were great. From the merky dungeons, to the ugly castles, to the dreary towns, dark forest, sanctuary, animals, everything about the environment was just great. They probably could have done a little more with the black forest but still, what they did do was great.

The ok but could have been much better

Battle Scenes: So the previews led me to believe this movie would be a braveheart style movie with a heroine and in the land of mysticism. It wasn't. There were a few battle scenes that were good but most were rather boring and no where close to epic. The very last confrontation was the best and did get you into it but every battle scene leading up to it was lack luster.

Story: Now the story is the story that we have all heard before. So I'm not complaining about THAT story, but really they didn't do enough with it to warrant me shelling 20 bucks for me and my wife to go sit in a theater to watch it. If you are someone that just ABSOLUTELY loves the story of Snow White then maybe you probably won't care but all the glitter and glam they added to the story, still fell short of being worth it and taking it from the old old story I've grown up hearing.

The bad

The acting: Kristen Stewart. I'm sorry but this was either not her movie or not her performance. I liked her in adventureland. But her acting skills either weren't strong enough for this role or she just wasn't the right match. She just fell short unfortunately.

All in all it's a decent movie worth watching. Is it worth shelling out 10 bucks a person to watch? No probably not. Is it worth a buck at redbox? Definitely. The beautiful environment and classic story are enough to bring you in but the lack of originality, boring battle scenes, and uneven acting is enough to give you pause.",1340150400,6,2392,4.428246013667426
4756583,4,B005LAIHSQ,"*Warning: Spoilers Ahead*
I really wanted to give Snow White and the Huntsman 5 stars. There were a few things that kept me from it. There were a couple different scenes that I felt were unfinished, as if more should have been added to them, or that there were missing scenes altogether. The effects are spectacular, truly mesmerizing at times. The costumes were immaculate and I could tell they were very well thought out. The battle scenes lacked... well, a lot. Most of them seemed to be too brief, and a few appeared to lack common sense.
I had hoped that Kristen Stewart (Snow White) would have done a better job of playing her part. ""Skin white as snow, lips red as roses, hair black as a raven's wing..."" While very pretty, and having no problem looking the part of Snow, Stewart seems lazy or overconfident in her role. Her performance gets a 3 star from me.
The movie brings to life the classic fairy tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but in a dark, twisted way, I might add. After the death of Snow White's (Kristen Stewart) mother, her father discovers a slave woman, dirty and locked in chains, in a carriage. With beauty beyond measure, Ravenna (Charlize Theron) - who gets 5 stars from me - takes his breath away, steals his heart, and within a day agrees to be his Queen. On their wedding night, Ravenna declares that her heart has been broken by a King before, and no other will ever get the chance to do it again. She stabs him to his death.
Now, the Queen for 10 years, Ravenna has everything, including a magic mirror that could possibly answer any question she could think to ask it. But her one nervous question, asked often, is this, ""Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is fairest of them all?"" For she would destroy any and all maidens who's beauty surpasses her own. To keep her flawless, un-aging body, she has to suck the youth and innocence from young girls like I would imagine a succubus or demon would.
One day the mirror tells Ravenna that Snow White's beauty will soon pass her own. But if Ravenna can kill her, she will have her beauty and immortality forevermore. So she sends her devoted brother to the towers where Snow White had been imprisoned since her father's death, leaving everyone in the kingdom to think that she was also dead.
Cleverly, Snow White escapes and runs into the Dark Forest. The dangers that await her there are extreme, but not worth going back to face her evil step-mother that will surely rip out her heart to gain immortality and beauty forever.
Ravenna offers to bring back to life the dead wife of the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) - who also gets 5 stars from me - if he can bring Snow back to her. He reluctantly agrees, but after finding Snow he listens to her pleas that the Queen is lying, and she will give him no such reward.
The Huntsman fights to save her from the Queen's brother and the dangers of the forest. And just when you think they will be safe, something threatens their lives again. They meet up with 8 dwarfs who try to help her, too. But the Queen seems to always be one step ahead. Ravenna uses a spell to transform herself to look like a close childhood friend of Snow's. The Queen in disguise offers her a bright red, poisonous apple, and after only one bite, it sends Snow to her death.
All her friends grieve the loss of Snow White. Her childhood friend, William (Sam Claflin) kisses her goodbye, then leaves her alone in the room with the Huntsman. The Huntsman then begins to confess his undying love to Snow and admits to having two loves in his life and failing them both. He kisses her goodbye and leaves the room she is in.
Snow opens her eyes, walks out to the crowd and plots to take back over the kingdom and kill the Queen.
The Queen finally falls to her own death by the hand of Snow White, but only after the death of quite a few people along the way. The kingdom and the land are restored to harmony, and the evil is lifted from the land.
All in all I thought this movie was great, but there was definitely room for improvement, hence the 4 stars. I will buy it the day it comes out on Blu-Ray, and probably watch it numerous times. One last thing, I took my 6 year old daughter to see it. The violence of the battle scenes was a little too much for her. But I highly recommended it for ages 10 and up!

4756584,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White and the Huntsman is a film that captivates and excites the viewer within two hours and seven minutes.  And to add to the excitement, the main premise of the film that involves the classic fairytale character Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and a slightly different band of seven dwarves.  Along with Snow White, the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), who was called to capture Snow White and return her to Ravenna (Charlize Theron), the evil queen who is on the never ending quest for immortality; she preys on unsuspecting individuals and literally breathes the life out of them in order for her to maintain her youthful beauty.  However, Ravenna appears to possess vanity to the extreme, especially as she seeks guidance from Mirror Man (Christopher Obi).  Director Rupert Sanders adds an enormous twist from the original classic fairytale but not without subtly maintaining elements in the film that viewers will most likely identify.

The title of the film may reveal much about the story of Snow White but diverts from the original story as well as the Disney film.  If viewers thought the Disney classic was dark and scary, especially as a child, one may see this adaptation rather more similar to the ""Harry Potter"" meets ""Lord of the Rings"" with a slight dabble of special effects on the ""Terminator"" side; it is the special effects and the cinematography that help to emphasize the dramatic and darker scenes in the film.  But in between the darker shades, there are lighter shades but rather brief when Snow White escapes the dark forest and encounters the seven dwarves terrain.  However, if one is looking for a classic song of ""high ho"" or birds singing along with Stewart, they will be disappointed; there are fairies and a deer-like creature that offers a hopeful moment for Snow White that is quite reminiscent of the Narnia films.  But the conflict ensues once more when Ravenna's brother Finn (Sam Spruell) and her henchman Aldan (Joey Ansah) wreak havoc and start a battle of flying arrows through the forest.  The film contains several battle scenes, but the most intense scene is the ultimate battle between good and evil, Snow White in her somewhat Joan of Arc regalia and Ravenna as a ""black swan.""

But as viewers will see with a story involving good versus evil, it is undeniable of what side will prevail.  Snow White and the Huntsman is a riveting film that may have viewers at the edge of their seat because although one may already know about the story of Snow White, this adaptation has unpredictable and surprising moments.  Indeed, a film recommended for viewers with an imagination.",1339718400,,2616,4.891402714932127
4756585,2,B005LAIHSQ,I remember seeing some critic's quote in a tv spot for Snow White and the Huntsman calling it a Masterpiece well clearly that's nonsense because Snow White and the Huntsman was a very mixed bag of a film..the first hour of it was bland and unengaging but When the dwarfs and the fairy forest came into the picture it became a little less bland and somewhat tolerable..Bob Hoskins was excellent as the blind elder dwarf and their is a sequence where this beautiful Irish folk song plays while the Dwarfs and Snow white are walking grieving over the loss of one of their own...The last ten minutes of the film had a few good bits in it but you could see how the Queen was going to die from a mile away it was obvious. The Queen's death was very anticlimactic especially considering Charlize Theron was spouting the best quote in the entire film while she was burning alive then moments later Snow White puts an end to her reign and that's the end of it..the film was decent but nothing to special..the true highlights of the film are the dwarfs and the mirror man.,1339718400,3,1062,4.4512820512820515
4756586,3,B005LAIHSQ,Charlize Theron is perfect in this role. She made the movie. The scenery was awesome. The Black Forest was cool and creepy and the Dwarfs were good as well as the creatures and special effects in this movie. I personally won't buy this unless i can get it used for a few bucks. It was a good movie but lacked something in my opinion. It just wasn't the block buster i had hoped for.,1339632000,,382,4.175675675675675
4756587,1,B005LAIHSQ,"This Snow white movie is so full of violence, blood and gore that it should be rated R, instead of PG-13, I was shocked when I saw the movie and realized that it was rated PG-13. this movie is also filled with a lot of flaws and is even a lot more worse than Wrath Of The Titans.
The actors and actresses are very bad, Snow white's skin isn't even white, her lips are not red, and she's not pretty. So whenever the mirror on the wall say's ""Snow white is the fairest of them all"" it is lying...
I don't like the evil queen, she is very scary, because there were scenes of her eating a dead bird's heart (very graphical blood), and she kills people constantly (which drove me insane). And they also show a scene where the queen has sex with the king! Now that's where the whole movie was ruined, now I am not against sex but small children may not understand sex because they are still innocent..
The only normal human being in the movie was Chris hemsworth the huntsman.
The special effects were very beautiful, but the ugly and disgusting little white fairy scene was very disturbing, because they came out of a birds belly, and they looked like aliens rather than fairies. (I am 11 years old and I was scared, when I saw the trailer of the movie I had no idea that it was going to be like a horror film).
The movie was also depressing, the scenes of the movie went like there was peace in 2 minutes, and then 10 minutes of killing and witchcraft, and on and on it goes till you get confused and not knowing what's going on.
The dwarf's were cute, one of them named Gus, dances with snow white and hugs her which made me smile, and then he's killed (this was so sad I almost cried, and children will be very sad and depressed by this scene).
There are lot's of horror-movie like scenes.
That's all of my opinions, there are more but I don't want to talk about this nightmare-satanism movie anymore..
And if you ask me this movie is a disaster, I am glad we only spent 5$ on the garbage.
I don't recommend this movie to children, you'd have to be 17 to be able to enjoy this junk.",1339459200,13,2080,4.215538847117794
4756588,4,B005LAIHSQ,"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is not the Walt Disney version of the popular fairy tale.  This is a dark, gritty reimagining of the legend, in which Snow White's stepmother Ravenna murders the King, usurps the throne, and locks up the young Snow White in a tower.  The new Queen (Charlize Theron) sustains herself by absorbing the youth and beauty of young women, instantly aging them, while the whole kingdom takes on a deathly pallor.

The audience meets a now grown Snow White (Kirsten Stewart) clinging to her faith in a filthy, freezing and lonely cell in a tower.  She manages to escape when the Queen's brother attempts to molest her.  She runs for her life in a dark forest, pursued by the Queen's henchmen, and by a huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) who ends up being an uncertain ally.

Magic is a key theme of the movie, whether the evil variety used so skillfully by the Queen, or the good magic exercised, sometimes unconsciously, by Snow White.  Snow White will survive a terrifying journey through the dark forest to an enchanted portion where she comes to understand her own powers.  Thus fortified, she will rally her father's remaining loyal subjects for a dramatic confrontation with the Queen.

""Snow White"" is a surprisingly entertaining movie.  The special effects are good to excellent, and Charlize Theron steals the movie, managing to portray a rounded character despite her necessary status as the villainess of the story.  There is some good location shooting around Britain and Ireland, and the supporting cast has lots of solid British actors behind the beards and underneath the armor.  The final duel between Snow White and the evil Queen is quite suspenseful, even though we think we know how it is supposed to turn out.  Recommended as good entertainment, but not for little kids.",1339372800,,1805,4.8980263157894735

Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.
----------------------------------------

***Brief Review of Film***

I just watched this on Sunday.  I also watched 'Promethesus'.  I can say with all honestly that I thought 'Snow White...' was much better.  The movie benefits from a good musical score, well known actors giving great performances, amazing CG effects, and a tried and true story that most people are familier with.

**Plot Details/Some Spoilers Ahead**

The film follows the classic tale of Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and how she was born to be the fairest of all the land.  Once Snow White's mother dies, her father marries Ravenna (Charlize Theron), who turns out to be an evil sorceress.  She quickly kills the King and overthrows the kingdom.  Snow White is then locked in a tower for many years.

I personally thought that Charlize Theron did a superb job as Ravenna.  Ravenna is quite an evil character that you the viewer will hate.  You will not have one scrap of pity for her.  She is SO evil you can't help but want her defeated.  Theron's only flaw may be that she lays it on a little thick sometimes, she brings the crazy a little too hard.

Well, before the Queen can cut out Snow White's heart and gain immortality forever, she escapes.  Enter the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth aka ""Thor""), who is forced to track down Snow White and return her to the clutchs of the Queen.  Along the way the Huntsman changes his mind and decides to aid Snow White.  Although this was obviously a side project for Hemsworth, he really does give it his best, he is a good actor.  Women alone will watch this movie just to see him.

I would like to add that I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart, especially after all the 'Twilight' movies.  But, in this movie I REALLY enjoyed her performance.  I also thought she looked and assumed the role quite well.  I will concede that she is apparently a talented actress.  I will in the future be on the watch for her non-'Twilight' movies.

The movie also delivers the 8 Dwarves to assist Snow White.  Yes, I said 8, but don't worry they fix that mistake pretty quickly...

In the end Snow White and her companions after being hunted and chased the entire movie, rally an army and march on the evil Queen's castle.  The Queen is finally defeated, but only after quite a few people die.  The kingdom and the land are restored to harmony, and the darkness of the evil sorceress is lifted.

--Summing Up--

This film at times feels like 'Lord of The Rings' and 'Chronicles of Narnia' combined.  Not that this is bad thing.  It is never sappy, Snow White is never singing to birds or deer or anything like that.  As I previously stated the CG effects are AMAZING, with all sorts of unique animals and creatures brought to life.  I will also dare say that there could be a sequel...time will tell.  The only CONS this movie has is that it doesn't go into detail about a few things.  Why does the evil Ravenna have so much power?  Who does Snow White love, William or the Huntsman?  Who was the giant deer with the large wooden antlers?  What were the Dwarves names again?  And so on.  In the end this is all minor stuff.

Overall this is a really good movie that men and women alike will enjoy.  So husbands and boyfriends take your women to this one.  Good luck having them not fantasize afterword about Chris Hemsworth...",1339372800,4,3613,4.621451104100946
4756590,2,B005LAIHSQ,"After seeing the trailers, I thought Snow White and the Huntsman would be an interesting film. Boy was I disappointed. I am actually quite shocked there are so many good reviews of this film. This may mean this review gets ""unhelpful"" by many of the committed. Worth the risk.

First, the script is so bad you can't suspend belief and enter the world of the film. This is necessary to get any sort of attachment to any of the characters. It is so bad that Hemsworth's shining moment sparks, at best, a small emotional thought. With a better script, there wouldn't be a dry eye in the theater. Multiple characters die and it is like watching coworkers eat. Boring. The characters has less depth than the average cartoon character. And there is no real sense of peril for any of the characters at any time in the movie. Ho hum! At best I can call this an interesting twist on the Snow White story that falls flat.

Second, I find it really hard to read reviews that have positive things to say about the acting. Christine Stewart is so bad, I found myself wishing she was a mime in her scenes. Charlize Theron, who has been given kudos for the role, is only good if you regard someone who can scream convincingly a good actor/actress. Hemsworth is more eye candy for the ladies in the film, but does win for the best acting in the film. Unfortunately, his moments are short in the script, so you don't get to see much of his acting. The rest of the characters are pretty much throw away.

Third, the cinematography and editing are nauseating. Not only figuratively speaking, at times the use of camera trickery and fast cuts (to enhance the action?) almost make you want to vomit. Parts of the battle and chase scenes are shot using a badly implemented ""Saving Private Ryan"" camera trick that simply makes your eyes boggle. Private Ryan used the narrow slit trick to give the feeling you were watching something that felt unreal, while this film uses it in a way that makes you want to shut your eyes to stop the madness.

With so much bad, I guess the fault falls on the director, Rupert Sanders. I hope his craft matures, as this film is awful.

The worst thing about this film is it had so much potential. The idea of taking the Snow White story and twisting it with a queen who possessed so great a chip on her shoulders is quite fascinating. Handled by better scriptwriters, it would have been magnificent. Directed by someone who understood a bit more about subtlety, it would have possessed far more intrigue. This is extremely important when you already know the story. And the battle scenes could have done without the badly implemented ""Private Ryan"" type of ""unreality"". In fact, being a bit more subtle in camera work and proper ""painting of the film canvas"" would have made the ride far more enjoyable.

Are there any shining moments? Certainly. It is interesting to see Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins as dwarfs. The CGI to accomplish this is far better than the hobbits in Lord of the Rings. And there are some nice battle scenes (when the camera trickery is not overused). The costuming is wonderful and the lighting is done very well. If the script held up the story better, you could appreciate the world more.",1339200000,9,3222,4.556131260794473
4756591,5,B005LAIHSQ,"**Spoilers ahead**

In one word it was breathtaking. The script, the scenery, the special effects, the costumes all worked together beautifully.  The special effects were especially amazing.

I am not generally a Kirsten Stewart fan, but she was amazing in this film and I can't imagine anyone else for the the role. The Snow White character in this version has a strong quietness to her. Locked in the tower she is helpless till she sees birds flying near a large stake, and uses it escape when the Evil queens pervy brother comes to take her to the queen.

Charlize Theron is extremely beautiful in this. Her character has a kind of Elizabeth Bathory style to her. As she drains the life young to give her power and magic. Charlize has a way of making you feel sorry for her. Her character has been hurt by love. She believes as society likes to believe, that a woman's power and usefulness is part of her being young and beautiful. When a women grows old and looses her beauty she is worthless and no longer needed. So to prevent this she does all she can. But the older she gets the more souls she needs.

The unique thing is its the huntsman that is more important than the prince and he is the one that brings back Snow from her death. The prince, though does truly play his part in saving Snow, seems to take a backseat to the huntsman. I found myself rooting for the huntsman over the prince. But that is one aspect that they leave you hanging on. She doesn't really end up with either.

The one thing I didn't like is that dwarves were not played by real little people. There are many amazing little people actors and I would have preferred to have seen the parts go to them. Even though some of my favorite actors were in the roles of the dwarves

4756672,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White and the Huntsman is a refreshing look at movie fairly tales, much closer to the literary stories than the sanitized Disney versions. The film keeps the basic story of an evil witch and the purity of Snow White while adding a sinister forest with a deadly troll and an enchanted fairy inhabited forest.  The dwarves are also part of the film, played by Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Bob Hoskins and Toby Jones, among others, filmed in close-ups with dwarf stand-ins used for long shots.  They provide comic relief and fight heroically for Snow White.

Charlize Theron as Ravenna gives a marvelous performance as Snow White's evil stepmother, who kills her husband King Magnus on their wedding night and seizes the throne for herself.  She clearly relished the role. On the other hand, Chris Helmsworth (as the Huntsman) and Kristen Stewart (Snow White) do not connect emotionally and their relationship never catches fire. Kristen Stewart does not bring a lot of passion to her role. She does a good job looking the part of a princess but it was disappointing at the end of the film when Snow White is crowned, looking regal, but has no lines to say to sum up her character. The film, at over two-hours long, moves rather slowly and there was a couple of scenes that I found could have been cut without harming the plot.

Perhaps the real star of Snow White and the Huntsman are the special effects, costumes and cinematography.  The film production is beautiful with the design of the forest, enchanted garden and castle adding to make the story much more engaging.  The score by James Newton Howard captures the mood of the film very well. I found Snow White and the Huntsman refreshing take on a well-known fairy tale despite the film being a bit slow.",1339113600,2,1762,4.719869706840391
4756673,4,B005LAIHSQ,"From my wife Sarah: I see many negative reviews here, but we really liked this movie. Here's why:

- It was simply very entertaining. It had several subtle changes to the Snow White story so that the movie kept us wondering what would happen next. The characters were much more complex than the fairy story, so much more interesting to watch. There was some action mixed with fantasy that made it exciting.

- Actress Charlize Theron was absolutely amazing and her character was well scripted. She brought this movie up to a whole other level. She gave amazing depth to the character of the evil witch, and made her much more than a fairy tale figure.

- It had a positive message ultimately.

This is definitely worth seeing for adults, and I'd probably watch it again. However this is NOT for kids. The story is rather dark, and although not bloody, there's some intense violence and some nudity.",1339113600,2,898,4.6645569620253164
4756674,1,B005LAIHSQ,"This movie was so bad that it's hard to find words to adequately describe its total ineptitude.
They had a couple of good ideas (barely), then added so much fluff that the gems of an idea or two were lost in the shuffle.
The actors either shouted or mumbled their way through their lines, and the whole thing turned into one huge jumbled up mess.
As for the so-called music!  Yuck!",1339027200,10,381,4.366197183098592
4756675,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Overall, Snow White is an entertaining two hours, but I can't oooh and ahhh without some ughs. This flick boasts some sweet and creepy special effects like mysterious black shards that obey an evil queen and a magnificent black cloak. I jumped with surprise more than once and shuddered a bit, too, as the effects often came out of nowhere. The overall feel of the film is dark. The story is well told with some fascinating additions to/and twists on the classic tale. Plenty of battle scenes (fast, clashing action with the hyperspeed that is popular of late) and heroes give the film plenty of edge-of-the- seat action.

Charlize Theron is in top form as she gives pure evil a wee bit of heart, even while she snacks on a few. This evil queen is helped in her quest for ""fairest in all the land"" (and for all eternity) by her creepy, enabling brother. Did I mention it was a dark film...not kidding about snacking on hearts. Kristen Stewart cuts the cords that bind her to Twilight and shines in several scenes. Chris Hemsworth plays a terrific anti-hero.

My complaint is that the film contained a few scenes that cluttered the experience for me. I believe there was an attempt to lighten up the intensity with some frivolous good magic and whimsy. But those moments were a head-scratching distraction that took away from the story. I was willing to suspend disbelief regarding Snow White's condition after being imprisoned for years and her enchanted escape, but balked at some of the other more whimsical moments.

I still consider Snow White an entertaining take on the fairy tale and I loved the effects. It's too dark for sensitive kids (and adults). And the whimsical moments (let's just say Troll Whisperer may be on Snow White's resume) may annoy those really looking for some otherwise satisfying visual artistic escapism.",1339027200,3,1834,4.7974683544303796
4756676,3,B005LAIHSQ,"This fairy tale film follows the basic plot points of the Grimm's Brothers' classic tale while preserving and even deepening the dark tone and fleshing out the flat, stock characters. These efforts vary in level of success, so I will start with the aspects I felt were successful.  The original tale is already pretty dark by itself with the evil queen wanting to cannibalize Snow White, but the film pushes the boundaries even more than I expected. The Evil Queen is the most evil and sadistic than I have ever seen in a fairy tale film. She gleefully sucks the youth and beauty out of random townspeople to fuel her magic and keep herself looking flawless. Her ability to kill with a touch and create construct soldiers make of glass and rock give a sense of real danger to the tale. It doesn't come as a surprise that a large group of women gather their daughters to live in a town far away and scar their faces to avoid the queen's attention and need to destroy beauty. For a PG-13 fairy tale film, I was very impressed that the dark tone of the Grimm tale was preserved and even made darker than their version of the tale.

Everything visual about the film was amazing. The setting and the special effects were phenomenal, especially the glass/metal constructs the queen makes. The CGI or makeup (I'm not sure which) that was used to age Charlize Theron's face was incredibly realistic. She went from young to old throughout the film in varying degrees in relation to how much magic she used and how many people she drained of youth and health. My favorite visual aspect was the costumes. Ravenna had about as many costume changes as Lady Gaga as she had different dress for almost every scene. The inclusion of bones was genius on her clothing as well as her metal claws and spiky crowns. There is no denying that this is a really pretty film.

I loved the Evil Queen, Ravenna. Instead of a mindlessly evil, two dimensional character, we got a deliciously evil queen with a tragic past and awesome magical powers. She vehemently hates men because in her experience they use and discard women when they are no longer useful or beautiful. This mentality creates her obsession to stay young and beautiful to keep her powers. Ravenna is by far the most interesting and magnetic character in the film. I can't help but feel some sympathy for her even as she eats raven organs and sucks the youth and health from people while sadistically looking into their eyes as she does it. I wish the whole film would have been about her her life from penniless orphan leading up to becoming the evil sorceress queen that conquers kingdom after kingdom. Charlize Theron did an excellent job capturing Ravenna's wide range of emotion and making her the most memorable character in this retelling.

The two things that really brought the film down for me were Kristen Stewart and the masses of unnecessary background characters. Kirsten Stewart's version of acting is grabbing her hair, sighing, hyperventilating, and leaving her mouth vacantly open for about 90% of the film. She has about 3 facial expressions and acts just as she does in Twilight and, from what I have seen, as she does in real life. Her character is only slightly better than Bella because the writing behind the film is better. The only nice thing I can say is that her natural hazel eye color looks much better than the brown contacts she had to wear in the Twilight films. In addition to a main character I cared literally nothing for, there were way too many minor characters. The Huntsman was fine and necessary, but Christ Hemsworth is a good actor and he was given very little to do. Snow's childhood friend Will was not needed at all. The love triangle had barely any actual romance and the two male characters could have been made into one. The dwarves were pretty useless as well, although generally enjoyable. They just seemed to eat up screen time while Snow meandered about until the final battle. The film needed a lot of streamlining both in the plot and in the characters.

Overall, I would say Snow White and the Huntsman is an enjoyable summer movie. It's definitely not perfect and could have used a lot of improvement, but it's a small step in the right direction for fairy tale films. If nothing else, go see if for Charlize Theron, the dark tone, and the beautiful visuals.",1338940800,5,4353,4.648051948051948
4756677,4,B005LAIHSQ,"It seems unavoidable and imperative:  all critics must be forced into some other line of work every second year, if only to cleanse a bit of their nearly unending cynicism.  They try so hard for erudition, yet end up sounding strangely bitter.

Case in point:  comparing ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" to films of this story that have come before, most notably the Disney version.  This is how classics are told for this generation, so let it be told!  Many got stuck with an actor's performance or some plot or visual element that distracted them from how they remember the story.  Never the way to have a good time at the movies.

""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a rousing - and moving - update of this staid but beautiful 200-year-old classic.  It even has positive messages for the kids; if you pay attention (as I think girls especially will).  Out of my personal five-star scale, I would give it a very strong 4.0.

If you can let go of such preconceptions - as you should whenever you go to the movies - you're going to have a GREAT time seeing ""Snow White and the Huntsman""!  It's got a bit of everything for just about everyone.  It's exciting, with some truly scary parts, and some genuinely beautiful scenes.  Mostly, I loved it for its genuine heart; something we don't often see in summer blockbusters!  Enjoy.",1338854400,10,1323,4.5702127659574465
4756678,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Snow White and the Huntsmen is a truly dark and action packed version of the classic fairy tale. It's like they tried to take a simple story and turn it into an epic Lord of the Rings version. It didn't quite reach that level, but the visuals, action scenes, music and acting were great. Charlize Theron made for a beautiful and very, very evil queen. Thor himself did a fine job as the huntsman and even Kristen Stewart was good enough for me to forget about that Twilight garbage. Even the dwarves, played by non-dwarf actors like Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane and Ray Winstone had shining moments. Not much else to say other than it was worth seeing in theaters and I know I'll be watching it again on Blu-ray.",1338768000,5,708,4.453846153846154

I put Twilight behind me and was hoping she'd redeem herself. Except it was like watching Bella all over again. The same three facial expressions and mannerisms that plagued Twilight also plague this movie. She did not appeal to me as the rising underdog to overcome the hardships she'd faced. And in no way was she fairer than Charlize Theron. They would have done much better to cast an unknown.",1338768000,4,692,4.680327868852459
4756680,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Bored.  I can't remember waiting for a movie to end for so long.  There was disappointment, but mostly boredom.  Might I add that there is little less credible in the world than Kristen Stewart's armored Snow White wielding sword.

Another misleading trailer.  I thought I was in for a contemporary fairy tale with epic action.  Instead I yawned my way through two hours as Kristin ""the one-look-Zoolander"" Stewart sulked her way through another over-produced, underwritten movie with an emotionally bewildered expression which begs the question did somebody just fart?  [End rant]

This really ""could"" have been epic.  Many snippets, scenes and concepts/ideas were excellent; it's just that many others were not.  The opening winter scene was stark, but oh so powerful (most memorable of the movie, I'd say).  But then it was largely followed by scenes shot too close up to enjoy the storybook grandeur.  However it wasn't all bleakly shot.  Formidable castlescapes impressed and the brilliant enchanted forest reminded me that there was some serious insight behind this film's production while also breaking the lowlight gray color palate of the scenes from The Dark Forest and the dungeon-like castle.  The fairy forest was like Ferngully meets Pandora, filled with all manner of enamoring CGI flora and fauna.  Conversely, the fairies seemed like something out of a Saturday morning children's show as if they were thrown together at the last minute before the movie's release.  These are but few examples of the inconsistent quality throughout the film.

I thought this would be an action/adventure movie.  But it didn't feel like one.  The chthonic troll was my favorite critter.  But the action (i.e., between the troll and the huntsman) was brief, ill-imagined and ultimately anticlimactic.  The queen's glasswork soldiers are cool early in the movie as they shatter in slo-mo on the battlefield, but the scene is all about the effects and not about the action.  During the finale, these minions are animated semi-humanoid blobs of glass shards which move so fast you can't tell what they're doing.  I wish I could unsee that scene.  In general, the action in this movie was like poor quality background noise.  It was never the focus of any one scene, but it was always too distracting to ignore.  Anyone expecting Lord of the Rings quality sword fights or man-versus-creature bouts would likely be disappointed.

Really, Charlize Theron's queen made for the best moods and moments.  Her wardrobe was creatively architected to look both painfully donned and elegant while royal with trappings of the macabre.  At times her acting may come off as a bit extreme, but hey--she ""is"" playing an evil aging witch queen obsessed with youth and power.  You could feel her desperation, pain, flagging sanity...oh yeah, and evil.  The best effects were cast on the queen's sorcery as she shifts form in disguise and agonizing aging.

Chris Hemsworth portrayed the right character the right way, but with the wrong lines, weak character development and no heroic scenes.  His action scenes either focus little on his character (rather the whole battle or situation) or result in him getting his butt kicked.  They also made the huntsman a depressed alcoholic widower, but offer little to justify his convenient noble transformation throughout the movie.  The dwarves, who in three minutes quickly shift from murderous rogues to stalwart allies, were really only as interesting as the actors you recognized behind the odd haircuts and facial prosthetics--namely Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Nick Frost and Toby Jones.  They offer little to lighten the mood, in fact often distracting from the tone with too many weak lines, frequent and ineffective attempts at comic relief, and way too much screen time. Oh, right, and the ""Prince"" guy (William) felt like a completely needless character.

Stacked upon all this is that a lot of things go unexplained.  Just because you can get away with that in a kid's fairy tale doesn't mean you can do that with the adult contemporary version.  I'm complaining a lot here, but the movie isn't necessarily to be skipped.  Many of the effects and scenes would be far more enjoyable on the big screen (or at least a large HDTV) with surround sound.  Just don't make a Friday night event out of it--save it for a rainy Sunday afternoon.  A portion of these scenes, effects and ideas are why I say this movie ""could"" have been epic.  The skill set was there.  But the writing wasn't--in terms of story fluidity and dialogue, that is.  But hey, this was director Rupert Sanders' first film.  For a first job, and one of such magnitude, he showed some serious imaginative chops...he just didn't do so consistently.  Keep an eye out for him in the future.

WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD:  I'm going to go way out on a limb here and say that The Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) accomplished what this film was trying to.  Not your style?  Then I'd wind back the clock for some nostalgic darker fantasy fun.  How about Legend (1985), Labyrinth (1986), The Dark Crystal (1982), Wizards (1977), The Last Unicorn (1982), The Whiz (1978) or Return to Oz (1985).  Too old for you?  Then why not just aim for LOTR.",1338768000,13,5221,4.967667436489608
4756681,3,B005LAIHSQ,"In ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", first-time director Rupert Sanders offers a new, less than successful interpretation of the Brothers Grimm's timeless fairy tale. There are some things I enjoyed in the movie. The scenery in Pembrokshire and Marloes Sands, Wales, is lonely, rugged and spectacular. Much of the film takes place in a frightening place called the Dark Forest replete with snakes, gnarled trees, out of the way paths and strange creatures. It is a good setting in its own right as the huntsman leads Snow White through its treacherous maze. And the movie offers long scenes of crystalline yet forbidding lakes.

Kristen Stewart stars as the heroine while Charlize Theron overacts as the extrarordinarily wicked Queen Ravenna. In this version of the story, Snow White has two suitors: Eric,portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, a rugged huntsman grieving over the death of his wife, and the aristocrat William, Snow White's childhood friend, played by Sam Claffin, who is in rebellion against the wicked, usurping queen. The acting is acceptable if sometimes stilted. The dialogue frequently is commonplace.

The movie changes the usual telling by deemphasizing love and romance and making Snow White a active independent person in her own right. In the traditional tale, Snow White sleeps and much of the action focuses on the eccentric, affectionate Seven Dwarfs.  In this story the Dwarfs are eccentric indeed but they are a mean group, won over to the princess with difficulty.  There is an apple and an awakening kiss but little is made of it. Instead, Snow White becomes a Joan of Arc figure and leads an attack, shown in great detail, on Queen Ravenna and her well-fortified and defended castle. Love and romance get downplayed, as Snow White becomes an independent, strong willed, benevolent, and self-sufficient ruler without a man at her side.

Plotting and pacing are major issues with ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". At over two hours in length the movie drags.  There are too many characters and special effects which, while frequently interesting in themselves, take away from the story. The story line is unduly tangled and difficult to follow with its many distractions. Romance is pushed aside in a way that does not improve or modernize the old tale.  There are magic mirrors, attack birds, shards of glass, strange creatures, lots of violence and a coming of age for the heroine. But the movie is gimmicky and lacks cohesion, timing, and tension.

There are some interesting things in this movie, but it fails to enhance its classic story.

4756824,3,B005LAIHSQ,"Alright, I'm going to keep this review as short and sweet as possible.

The Fantastic:

The environments that have been re-imagined are absolutely gorgeous, in fact, I would go so far as to say they top that of Alice in Wonderland and nearly rival Avatar.

Performances by Theron, Hemsworth, and just about every supporting actor are superb. Believable characters who, at some points, you can relate to on a very personal level.

Action sequences are fairly well played out, although in a couple of areas you have a severe 'are you kidding me' moment, like when Snow White rouses the Duke's troops to storm the queen's castle, then refuses to call them back despite the fact that they're locked out and being slain while waiting on the dwarves to raise the gate. Never let a princes lead a tactical military advance, right?

The imagery is very dark and in some places relatively creepy, some memorable moments are Snow White's initial journey into the Dark Forest and the Queen's knack for sucking the youth out of other people.

The poor:

Kristin Stewart. I'm sorry, but she's not an actress. I have no idea who in Hollywood thought she was a profitable individual, but her acting in general, and especially in this movie, are sub-par (ESPECIALLY in comparison to Hemsworth and Theron). That aside, I personally feel she wasn't even a proper cast for Snow White. I don't find her particularly attractive and her features don't compliment the character's very well. Half-way through the movie, I was so tired of seeing her I wanted to leave, save for the hope that her screen-time would become limited.

I understand that the character was to be one who has been alienated from humanity for over a decade, and has had to endure severe hardships; rather than feel these elements in Stewart's performance, I mostly got exactly what came out of Twilight- nothing. She has as much charisma as a 2x4 plank.

To her credit, she does break away from the Twilight mold in a couple of scenes and appears to attempt to act, but it fails horribly. The scene in which she is rousing the kings troops left me smacking my face with my palm in disbelieve that such a sensitive moment could have been portrayed so poorly, and her one-liner after killing the queen that the queen would ""never take [her] heart"" was just... Just atrociously depicted.

For every other aspect of the movie, I would give a solid 5 stars, the supporting acting, artistic design, music, and script are all well done.

Kristin Stewart's job earned a full 2 stars simply because she at least made the attempt to act in a scene or two.

Overall, I give the movie 3 stars. If you REALLY want to, see it in a theater in 2-d (not worth the extra price for the 3-d one), and wait for the dvd price to drop to 10 or 15 bucks if you feel the need to own it.",1338681600,24,2811,4.577689243027889
4756825,5,B005LAIHSQ,"Indeed, Snow White meets the Grimm in the film version out in theaters this last Friday. I love the concept of giving Snow much more to do than lay in a coma waiting for her Prince. When she awoke after the Huntsman's kiss, it seemed that she left the fairies and fantasies behind to pick up a sword to fight the good fight...a decision not made in the fanciful tales we grew up with. Kristen Stewart is worthy of leading a film. I'll buy a copy for my DVD library to go along with the Twilight Saga when it is available.",1338681600,2,521,4.1683168316831685
4756826,2,B005LAIHSQ,"Mirror Mirror on the wall, is this the greatest Snow White movie of them all? The answer to that question is no. And I had a feeling that this was going to be a pretty bad Snow White movie. But I gave it a chance because who knows it could have been a really great movie.

Pros: Visually the fantasy was great I loved seeing the magical creatures and the forest and I liked how there was more of a back story to the Evil Queen as to why she became evil. The only good actors that shined were Chris Hemsworth (as the Huntsman)and Sam Claflin(as Prince William)and both actors were nice to look at too! But thats all.

Cons: We already saw the best parts of the movie in the previews. The acting from Charlize Theron was over the top and she acted like a hormonal woman rather than an evil Queen. Kristen Stewerts acting as Snow White was terrible but not surprising. She had her mouth open a lot and didn't speak a whole lot except grunt and make sounds. She also had 2 looks on her face being confused or looking annoyed. And her british accent was akward and not believable. I also found out that many other actress's were considered for the part of Snow White but the director was probably desperate to make a movie. And the love triangle between her, The Huntsman and the Prince was ridiculous. It was like Twilight all over again. Sorry Twihards Edward and Jacob took a break from Bella! Can't we just have one main girl and one main guy be together? Enough already with the love triangles. Even with the love triangle when her true love kissed her YOU KNEW who he was and you knew who she was going to end up with. Even with the love triangle there wasn't enough romance.

I think if the director wrote a better story and he had better actress's to play Snow White and the Evil Queen this movie would have stood a chance at doing great. But for people who haven't seen the movie yet I suggest you wait to watch it on t.v. or just rent it and then you decide whether its worth the buy or not. Just don't expect this movie to be an academy award winner or the acting to be believable.",1338681600,12,2087,4.251889168765743
4756827,4,B005LAIHSQ,"Oho! I knew it was only a matter of time before Kristen Stewart and I would cross paths. I've avoided the Twilight saga like the cooties, and so I've missed out on the fuss and the furor about her. But I couldn't pass up on SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN like I passed up on MIRROR MIRROR, and, it turns out, I sort of fancy Stewart's performance. Skin white as snow, lips red as roses, hair black as a raven's wing. That fleshes out Kristen Stewart to a tee. Still, it's nigh impossible to trump Charlize Theron's turn as Snow White's rather... self-absorbed... step-mother. Theron simply mesmerizes. She's so good there are moments you sympathize with her - that poor, gorgeous, demented queen who as a girl was cursed by a mother's dark gift. Evil begets evil, and you sense that Ravenna must have endured some unspeakable sh--. Not that that makes up for her nasty practice of sucking the beauty and vitality out of innocent girls... Queen Ravenna is like the grim fairy tale version of Project Runway.

It's a darker iteration, grittier, moodier, more full-blooded. I think the Brothers Grimm would've approved of this interpretation; it matches their gristly sensibilities more. If you've brushed up on the fairy tale, then you know the kernel of the story. SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN tweaks and embellishes on that. When the vain and vile but oh-so-beautiful witch Ravenna (Theron) murders her husband, the king, on their wedding night, it upends the kingdom, sinks it into a realm of despair and oppression. We also learn that this is only the most recent in a long series of regicides that Ravenna has committed. The king had one young daughter, Snow White, lovely and bright and pure, whom Ravenna promptly sentences to incarceration in the castle dungeons. For years Snow White languishes in wretched confinement.

I don't know how I feel about how the magic mirror is presented, the film granting it the ability to metamorphose, liquid metal like, into a faceless, flowing figure that stands before Ravenna whenever she extends that one familiar question. I get that they were trying to change it up with the mirror, but then they forgot the follow-thru. so, the mirror can assume a form. And then what? And then nothing.

In the story I read ages ago, the huntsman takes Snow White into the woods, at the Queen's behest, and in the woods the huntsman was tasked with carving out Snow White's lungs and liver (if I remember it right) as proof of her demise. But the huntsman demonstrates mercy and allows Snow White to flee. He instead presents to the queen the lungs and liver of a boar, and so the queen comes to believe that Snow White was indeed deaders. And so the huntsman exits the tale. But you only have to glance at the film's title to get a whiff that the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), this time out, lands a meatier role, sticks around a bit longer.

Another fashion in which this film veers away from the fairy tale we know (**coughDisneyAnimatedFilmcough**): I like that there's only a smidgen of romance, but I like that the smidge that IS there is crucial to the plot. Not to get all Twilighty, but the story does force you to choose a camp to follow: that of the surly, drunken huntsman What'shisface or Snow White's childhood pal and the Duke's dashing son, William (Sam Claflin). Note that William is a bowman who seems to rival the Avengers' Hawkeye in uncanny marksmanship. Meanwhile, I think Chris Hemsworth exhibits solid acting chops, lending tortured depth and melancholia to his huntsman. He takes a Scottish accent out for a spin, and I'm gullible enough or listened to James Doohan enough to be convinced by it. But the trailers to ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER put Hemsworth's axe-work to shame.

SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN flaunts a secret weapon, or rather, eight secret weapons, in the shapes of dwarves. It kinda sucks for actual dwarf actors out there, because the film employs normal-height actors who then were CG'd down to Gimli-size. But, then again, Peter Dinklage is damn busy nowadays. These contentious dwarves - as played by the likes of Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, and Nick Frost - end up stealing many scenes.

It's a stunning-looking movie, or to quote my date: ""Ohhh, so pretty!"" Rupert Sanders, after a career of helming snazzy advertisements, makes his debut as a feature film director. He brings along that same eye for spectacular visuals. He lends a spooky and foreboding atmosphere to the twisted Black Forest, and it marks Snow White's abject desperation that she elects to seek dubious sanctuary within its sickly boughs. When tree branches make it a habit to transform into serpents, I tend to wonder where I left my chainsaw (sorry, tree huggers). Conversely, Sanders' depiction of the fairyland is pretty damn wondrous and speaks to that inner child still in you (yes, even you). The narrative further expands to allow for Snow's encounter (or yell-off) with a bridge troll, and, later, with a tribe of females that had committed self-mutilation rather than face the Queen's attention. The film's final action flourish consists of the almost requisite epic battle. I've gotta credit Kristen Stewart. She does have presence and she does have charisma. Or maybe those eyes suckered me in. She rolls off that hokey rousing rally speech and just about pulls it off, and that with a British accent (that, okay, occasionally strays). Still, maybe my favorite bit - and I realize I kind of pooh-poohed the romantic angle earlier - concerns the kiss that galvanizes the poisoned princess. I saw it coming, I'm sure you'll see it coming, but it was still a very strong scene. An ""Oh, yeah!"" kinda scene. Crap, there goes my mushy side. Great. Now even my date is telling me to man up.

Here she plays the titled Ms. White, the rightful heir to her father's throne, who is now imprisoned.  Dad was murdered on his wedding night (the mother of Snow died earlier) by the beautiful Ravenna (an evil, juicy Charlize Theron).  Ravenna, it appears makes use of her great beauty by marrying and eliminated various kings.  She pulls this off for many years because of a spell she received that requires her to drain the life from the kingdom's unspoiled young women.  Snow White is too young, so in the cell she goes.

There are several episodes of the ""mirror mirror on the wall"" chant but this mirror isn't just an animated glass mirror.  It is gold and becomes molten (think ""Terminator 2"") and forms a humanoid shape.  This version of the Grimm classic is appropriately dark and full of filmmaker wizardry, including a colorful section of mushrooms with eyes, forest creatures and a white stag.  An obvious homage to the Walt Disney original.  While the film waffles back and forth between light and dark it also has a tendency to bog down just when it starts to get good.

The battle scenes are PG-13 cool enough and Kristen Stewart is fetching in her battle armor, but the film falls short of ""Game of Thrones"" (numerous unintended comparisons) in style and substance.  After about 8 years of imprisonment the now a young woman, Snow White manages to escape and enters the dark forest ultimately engaging a would-be hunter (Chris Hemsworth) and a childhood friend (Sam Claflin) as fellow combatants in an effort to dethrone the evil queen.  To the filmmaker's credit, Snow doesn't spend any time thinking of romance with either of the hunks longing for her favors.  She's obviously too busy planning the overthrow.  So who's the fairest of them all?  My vote goes to Charlize Theron.",1338595200,2,1974,4.882882882882883
4756831,2,B005LAIHSQ,"""Snow White"" was originally a European fairy tale made famous as one of the Grimm Brothers 1812 collection. It appeared in a 1916 silent film and a 1933 Betty Boop cartoon before achieving eternal fame in the 1937 Disney animated feature. That film was the first full length animated feature, was #1 at the box office in 1938, won an Honorary Oscar, and earned a spot (#49) on AFIs list of the best films of all time.

Since 1937 the story has been reprised on occasion - ""Snow White and the 3 Stooges"" (1961), ""Snow White"" (1987), ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" (1997), ""Sydney White"" (2007), and ""Mirror Mirror"" (2012).

The most recent version, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a 2012 fantasy with Charlise Theron as the wicked queen, Kristen Stewart as Snow White, and Chris Hemsworth as the huntsman.

South Africa born Charlise Theron is the Oscar winning actress (""Monster"" 2003) who has been in more than two dozen films including ""North Country"" (2005), ""The Italian Job"" (2003), and ""Men of Honor"" (2000). Her role as the wicked queen is one of her worst performances ever.

Kristen Stewart is best known from the ""Twilight Saga"" films. The buck toothed tom boy is certainly attractive, but no beauty, and far from the ""fairest in the land."" Indeed Charlise Theron clearly retains the title.

Chris Hemsworth is best known as ""Thor"" from the film of the same name and the subsequent ""The Avengers"" (2012). He should probably stick with this genre. His performance is uneven, and he certainly doesn't fill the need for a hero in a film like this.

The script is all inclusive - they not only manage to keep much of the original story, they add gigantic trolls, gnomes, a tribe of women without men, fairies, a 20 point white antelope, and 8 dwarfs. That's right - 8. Count `em yourself. One dies, so in the end there are only 7.

This is such a bad film, and it goes on for hours and hours, the only redeeming quality is some beautiful photography. There are some nice special effects, as when the wicked queen seems to be composed of a group of crows. But they overuse this special effect - trees consist of butterflies, the antelope consists of white birds - so that it gets tiresome after awhile.

In the end, the story itself cannot be resolved, but I can't reveal this without spoiling the film for those who choose to see it. But I can't imagine who that would be. It's not suitable for kids, and there's not enough action for adrenaline junkies, nor enough fantasy for the sword and sorcery crowd. Fans of romance will also be disappointed, and people looking for the dark side will probably not find enough darkness here.

Bottom line - a poor film that doesn't do justice to the story nor to the excellent 1937 film.",1338595200,17,2734,4.597535934291581

It will neither offer the option from my remote (even after I put fresh batteries in - not the remote), nor will it respond to the command in the initial SETUP directory before the movie starts.  Pretty annoying, he previews preceding the movie are fine, but could not watch the movie. I had Amazon replace it once with the very same issue.  This was not an issue with the SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN movie DVD.  Much too annoying so I'm returning the set.",1528329600,,541,4.434343434343434
