5373508,5,B009Z4ADVS,"For those of you who are fans of one or both of these movies, this is good news!
I happen to be a fan of ""Chilly Scenes of Winter"".  It's not a perfect movie (John Heard's character saying he was ""going to rape"" his estranged girlfriend still makes me cringe) but there's so much that's wonderful in it, and now it's available in a quality well-made version.
Letterbox, clear, crisp picture and sound.  If you like this movie - or ""Cutter's Way"", which comes with it - check it out.

SPOILER ALERT!!!

Since writing the above I have learned that there are three endings to this story: the one in Beattie's novel (ambiguous reunion), the one in the first movie version (happy reunion), and the one in the edited movie version (breakup).  I liked the book when I read it in 1976, and have only seen the second movie version.  I've never liked the ending and think the one  Beattie gave it in the book would have been the better one.  But the movie was originally made in 1979, so I guess it's done!  There's enough in it to enjoy, so I still recommend this great 2-film set.",1353283200,5,1072,4.373737373737374
5373509,1,B009Z4ADVS,"Buyer beware!!! I got this as a present for my brother who is a John Heard fan. I gave it to him in mid March. Only yesterday he told me that after 8 minutes, his screen went blank and the disc appears empty. He tried it on two other DVD players, same outcome. So I found out today the return date ended March 26.
So, if you're buying DVD's as gifts, have them checked ASAP, and tell them not be be embarrassed to tell you if it doesn't work!!!",1461888000,2,444,4.0

WARNING - Spoilers for Chilly Scenes Below

I was excited to share one of my favorite old movies with my wife so we watched it a few weekends ago.  First off, the video quality is excellent for a DVD-R.  Kudos for that.  But as I watched the movie from a 21st century perspective, John Heard's Charles character is so obsessed, so extreme in his behaviors that it's almost scary.  From building a model of Laura's home, a house that she shares with her husband and daughter, playing with figurines of Laura and Ox (Laura's husband), threatening to rape Laura when she doesn't see things his way, threatening to kick the ass of her gynecologist when she needs to go for a normal yearly exam... these are not even close to normal behaviors.  If I hadn't already watched the movie I would have feared that by the end of the movie Laura would be chopped into pieces and in Charles' refrigerator so he could have the ultimate control over her.

It seriously pains me to not still love this movie anymore.  As my wife and I watched the movie and I grew more and more uncomfortable with Charles behavior I said to my wife, ""He's kind of creepy, isn't he?""  Her reply, ""only kind of... ""

There are many more examples I could provide of the excesses of Charles behavior, but better to say this; having raised a teenage son and spending time around his friends I can tell you that Charles all-or-nothing obsession is very much like an emo-teenager, very immature and adolescent.  And for those that argue the ending with the two of them reuniting should be available all I can say is this; if you watch the movie, there is no way in any real world that Laura would ever go back to someone so suffocating, so stalker like, so obsessed... and if she did, she ends up chopped up in his freezer when she tries to leave.

I know many that loved this movie when they first saw it still see the movie through rose colored glasses and my review won't change any of those minds.  This review is meant for those unsure or new to this movie.  This movie should be avoided.",1456012800,,2224,4.374695863746958
5373511,5,B009Z4ADVS,Picture quality on Chilly is crisp.  So happy I can get this on DVD. Really would love it if they added the alternate ending as an extra.,1422489600,,137,4.074074074074074
5373512,3,B009Z4ADVS,"These are both decent films that stand up well after 30 plus years.  John Heard is at his best in these flicks.  Truth to tell, I ordered this double-barreled offer not for Heard and Jeff Bridges in Cutter's Way, but for Chilly Scenes of Winter (which, when I first saw it in my youth, was called Head over Heels, a much better title).  This film was written and directly by Joan Micklin Silver who did Crossing Delancy.  Chilly Scenes, though, is not a romantic comedy.  Or, rather, it is, but it's an inside out version.",1396137600,,522,4.4526315789473685
5373513,5,B009Z4ADVS,Chily Scenes is one of my all-time favorite films and the transfer is beautiful. And Cutter's is a nice bonus. Good Deal!,1375660800,,121,4.545454545454546

5373515,5,B009Z4ADVS,"""Chilly Scenes of Winter""--one of my favorite movies of the 1980's is FINALLY on DVD, in a very solid transfer.  If you don't know this movie (or its spiritual kin: ""Between the Lines"" by the same director), you should.  The price is right, and the fact that it's on a double bill with another ""lost"" film, ""Cutter's Way"", ought to seal the deal.  These are two different movies, but thy're both worthy of your attention!",1369267200,,421,4.586666666666667
5373516,5,B009Z4ADVS,"Great to finally have this on DVD, but as others have pointed out, they should really have included the original ending as an extra. (I only hope the footage hasn't been destroyed.) I've been waiting ever since the premiere to see the original ending again, though I think it's posted on Youtube somewhere. I much prefer the original ending, but I've read that Ann Beattie, author of the novel the movie is based on, preferred the revised ending as being more true to the book (though the book ends in yet a third way, as I recall). First time I ever saw the versatile and charming Peter ""Local Hero"" Riegert. And a wonderful farewell role for the fabulous Gloria Grahame. As for Cutter's Way, it's also a very good, quirky, but much darker, film, with moving performances by John Heard and Lisa ""The Europeans"" Eichorn. But it's been available on DVD for quite awhile already, so I don't see the point in reissuing it as part of this set. Would have been better to reissue it with the film Joan Silver made just previous to this, also with John Heard, called Between the Lines, which I see Amazon has finally made available on separate DVD-R. I guess we'll have to wait for a Joan Micklin Silver box set (like THAT'S ever going to happen!). She's an unjustly neglected director. By the way, I agree with the other poster that Heard's ""rape"" line also makes me cringe. An unfortunate bit of dialogue in a comedy.",1365984000,5,1412,4.562992125984252
5373517,4,B009Z4ADVS,"Fans of these movies already know. The talk on the IMDB has been all about it!
The price is good considering this is an on demand DVD. and 2 great movies.
But doesn't get the 5th star because we all want the alternate ending to Chilly Scenes.
These are two movies to watch over and over.",1357862400,4,287,4.142857142857143
5373518,5,B009Z4ADVS,"I've only watched CHILLY SCENES OF WINTER so far, and it is an excellent transfer, given that it is a manufactured-on-demand (MOD) disc.  It is properly letterboxed and looks great visually.  One of the best things about this set is that each film is on a separate disc, which provides a better bit rate for each film.

The only disappointment is that the alternate ending from the original theatrical version of CHILLY SCENES OF WINTER (which was entitled HEAD OVER HEELS) hasn't been included.  The alternate ending would have made a great supplemental feature.  In fact, I'd have preferred to have a two-disc set of both versions of this film, namely HEAD OVER HEELS and CHILLY SCENES OF WINTER.  However, this new MOD is a great improvement over the old VHS of CHILLY SCENES OF WINTER.",1353888000,16,789,4.764705882352941

8545499,4,B009Z4ADVS,"I threw out Cutler's Way. It was awful and needed subtitles.

With regard to Chilly Scenes of Winter, I gave it four stars. I bought both as a package never having seen either one. I liked  John Heard and I bought many of his movies and trashed most after one watch. Chilly Scenes kind of grows on you after each watch and I've watched it many times now and enjoy it. Obsessions can be fascinating and he played a lonely guy with a pathetic life who, in his case, could not have been obsessed with the one woman who was emotionally unavailable to anyone. At least he was able to finally let her go..\

His two best movies are Deceived and The Pilot's Wife.",1517529600,,656,4.274193548387097
8545500,5,B009Z4ADVS,"Chilly Scenes of Winter is one of my all-time favorites - but, I prefer the Head Over Heals version (same movie with a few differences, and it's not the Freddie Prinze Jr. one)",1514246400,,176,4.363636363636363
8545501,3,B009Z4ADVS,"Dont get me wrong. Im delighted that Chilly Scenes has finally been released on DVD  its a classic in that rarified genre of the obsessive romance  and the fidelity of the transfer is excellent.

But I still wish the packagers had done a more thorough job.

For this is simply a different medium with no extras. How about the basics: subtitles and scene selection? How about commentary from participants (who were all alive when this edition was assembled in 2012)? Heck, how about the original upbeat ending from Head Over Heels (the original 1979 release) and some insights on the retitling and more successful rerelease as Chilly Scenes?

Granted, we do get Cutters Way, which also co-starred the late John Heard and indeed has an even more colorful production history. Its won respectful attention, but its neither a good thematic nor conceptual fit with Chilly Scenes, being a thriller on one hand and having already received a better DVD treatment in 2001 on the other. (This one is as bare-bones as Chillys.)

Personally, Id have preferred 1977s Between the Lines. Its not as strong a film as Chilly Scenes, but it was Heards first role, it was likewise directed by Joan Micklin-Silver and, to the best of my knowledge, it still hasn't made it to disc.",1513814400,2,1259,4.805555555555555

8545503,5,B009Z4ADVS,"When John Heard died recently, every obituary identified him primarily as the father from the Home Alone movies. And that's a pity, because Heard was so much more than that ... and in these two forgotten films from the 1980s, we see what he was really capable of as an actor.

In ""Cutter's Way"" he delivers a volcanic performance as a bitter, maimed, cynical, snarling, profane Vietnam Vet who still burns with the idealism of the younger man he once was, hungry for justice, fiercely wanting to balance the scales a little between the rich & powerful and those they so casually use & discard. When his best (and nearly only) friend (Jeff Bridges) thinks he sees someone disposing of a body & then thinks he recognizes the man as a local figure of unassailable power & wealth, there's no turning back. A stunning examination of the America that was emerging in the 1980s & has reached its full, ugly, grasping flower today in a culture glorifying greed, selfishness, and callousness. If Heard had never made another film, this role alone would make him memorable.

And then there's the hapless, yearning Romantic of ""Chilly Scenes of Winter"" -- an utterly different person, in an utterly different film, delivering a heartfelt performance in a quirky, tender, melancholy film about love & loss. In a film filled with small jewels of performance from every actor (including a fine last appearance on film from Gloria Grahame), Heard more than holds his own as the center of the story, albeit a center that's somewhat adrift. I think any man of even the slightest sensitivity will recognize his character, and may even have been that character at some earlier point in life.

Some reviewers have called these films dated. I disagree. While they speak to & about the time in which they were made -- as most films do, in fact -- they're more than just time-bound artifacts. Like any really good films, they transcend their specific time to speak about the human condition at all times. What was true in them then remains true today. I think a lot of current movie fans tend to be so caught up in the flavor of the minute that they ignore the wealth of fine films outside of that fleeting minute. Here's a chance to experience two films that engage both feeling & thought, passion & intelligence -- films that have something meaningful & moving to say. Most highly recommended!

Note: I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention one of my favorite John Heard performances as poet Thomas Harriman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mindwalk-VHS/dp/6302670306/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mindwalk [VHS</a>] -- available only on VHS or various places online, alas.

8545505,2,B009Z4ADVS,"well, first of all, I am one of those irritating people who read the book first, then rarely like the movie.  Back in the seventies, I  loved the book and felt it was so true to the life of young people like myself at that time.  When the movie came out, and I watched it--I was so disappointed!  In its favor, John Heard if perfect as Charles, so true to the book and the personality of the character.  The actress playing Laura is all wrong-too short, ratty hair, and a personality that would not cause any guy-even a neurotic guy like Charles-to fall so madly in love.  The scenes with Charles building a model A-frame in his house is not in the book, and the ending is wrong.  sigh.  If you didn't love the book, or didn't read it, you probably will think the movie is fine, but a bit dull.  And truthfully, rereading the book today, even the original story doesn't pass the test of time.  But still-darn, such a disappointment!",1500681600,,932,4.366279069767442
