2604719,1,B000GBEWMA,"I just had to watch this little flicky for my film class... I didn't go in with high expectations, I mean it IS an independent film from Romania. But my god... what I got...

If I could, I would give this movie negative-infinity-plus-three stars. This movie is sheer torture, pure and simple. 2 1/2 of the longest hours of your life, watching a completely unlikeable old man just go from hospital to hospital. The movie moves at a snail's pace. The plot is paper thin. The movie is extremely dark and depressing (and not in a good way). I was wrong about ""I Heard The Mermaids Sing""; that movie still sucks, of course, but this one is far worse.

""The Death Of Mr. Lazarescu"" is my new least favorite movie.

Seriously. It makes IHTMS look like American History X. This movie is absolutely horrible. Why it's getting rave reviews and winning award after award, I'll never know. It really is torture, as stated earlier. Avoid at all costs. If you see a copy of this in your local store, burn your eyes. Hell, buy it just to ignite it on fire. One less copy of this P.O.S. in the world is worth $20. I know all the art-house snobs will scorn this review with the usual barrage of unhelpful votes and sophomoric insults (""3gplkant nos NOTHING bout reel sinnema LOL'ERZ""), but whatever. This movie sucks. Pure and simple.

I would even recommend The Smokers over this crap, and that's saying a lot! You have been warned! Tell the people!",1162425600,4,1433,4.521235521235521
2604720,5,B000GBEWMA,"- A good film - touching, humane, though ... not exactly a comedy, as billed on the DVD sleeve.  Worth watching !
- Minor technical problems with the DVD edition:  subtitles not always easy to read.  Surprisingly good Romanian to English translation.
- One of the rather few Romanian films with English subtitles available on DVD !
- I hope that in the not very distant future Romanian film directors will decide to take upon projects based on the Romanian national heritage - it looks like it takes Francis Ford Coppola to do ""Youth without Youth"" based on Micea Eliade's novella.",1159920000,4,581,4.732673267326732
2604721,4,B000GBEWMA,"Poor Mr. Lazarescu. His head has been aching all day, he's been vomitting and yet no one will help him. He's called the ambulance twice, and it has taken forever for it to arrive. He's even visited his neighbors to ask them if they have any painkillers, but, they seem a little annoyed. Not to mention his brother-in-law is hounding him about money he owes him.

 This is pretty much the set-up to Cristi Puiu's ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"". And the title gives away the ending, so, we are only left with the middle.

 ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"" is one of the first, if not the first Romanian film to receive huge international fame and actually be released in America in recent times.

 Ever since the fall of Communism in Romania the country has struggled trying to find its voice. Strickly speaking about their films (we won't even dwell in their politics) they seem to be drawn towards dark, cynical comedies that they think will appeal to western audience (namely Americans). But, Romanian humor is hard for Americans to digest. Most people do not understand our Eastern European humor. Because of this these films have either, not been released in this country or have not gained much cross-over audience appeal.

 The solution, of course, is easy. Romanians have to make films that are personal to them, not worry about what will appeal to Westerns. Now that Communism is over, why not make films dealing with life under its rule? Romanians could make human drama dealing with people and how life has changed since Communism's fall. Some films have attempted to do this, but with that dark humor. If Americans are familiar with Romanian films, there is a pretty good chance it is through the films of Lucian Pintilie and ""The Oak"", which dealt with the very subject of old world Romania meeting new world Romania.

 What all of this has to do with this film is ""Lazarescu"" is at least addressing a ""Romanian"" problem, but, it has universal appeal. See, if you stick to what you know, others will not only follow, but relate.

 The film has a pretty unusually style that American audiences might have a hard time getting adjusted to. The movie was shot primarily with a hand held camera. Why? One could say, well, it's because Romanians have no money and this is the cheapest way to make a film. I'm not sure that's the real reason. I think Puiu wanted the film to be shot this way because he wanted us to feel we are watching a documentary. We are suppose to think of this in terms of being real. Situations such as this really do happen all over the world.

 Much of the dialogue is terribly cynical. I didn't find the dialogue particularly funny, but, the situations were humorous. At time I started to wonder though, can it really be true? Can this really be the way doctors talk to their patients?

 So much of the film feels true. We are really going along on this man's journey as hospital after hospital refuses to keep the man and find out exactly what is wrong with him.

 I think the film also goes beyond just being a satire of Romania's health care system. It is also an attack on bureaucracy. The red tape government officials make us go through.

 Director Cristi Puiu says this will be the first of a series of films he plans on calling ""stories from suburbs of Bucharest"". There will be six in total as Puiu says he was inspired by Eric Rohmer's ""six moral tales"". In his own words he says the film is about man's regard towards his fellow man. Hopefully with the success of this film, which has won awards at various international film festivals including; Cannes, Norwegian, Transilvania, Independent Spirit Awards and in Chicago, we will see the five other stories in the series.

 Bottom-line: Very dark and cynical look not just at Romania's health care system but also a satire on bureaucracy. Director Puiu's debut film carries a nice pace to it by managing to really engage the audience due to the simplicity of the story and the human involvement the actors bring to their roles.",1158710400,19,4013,4.614627285513362
2604722,5,B000GBEWMA,"The camera follows a man's journey in his quest for a doctor that would treat his... we're not sure what because doctors, you see, work for hospitals and, before you can get any compassionate care you must first pass through the hospital's triage bureaucracy. And, how can a doctor be required to play bureaucrat and worry about law suits and other complications and still remain true to his professional oath? Good question but don't expect an answer here. Don't expect any answer. You just watch and think for yourself or... just watch.

Interestingly, the DVD's box claims that what we bought is a 'comedy'. Man gets sick but man dies because of the absurd medical system that refuses to treat him because... reasons are always easy to find. If this is a comedy, then the Romeo and Juliet story: boy and girl fall in love but they die (LOL) because of the absurd rivalry between their families should be viewed as a comedy too.

Besides the bizarre classification as 'comedy', it's a good DVD. The disk includes an interview with the director and a feature on the US health care system. Inside the case, there's a little booklet that has 2 good and informative articles about the movie and the director.

Definitely worth watching if you don't mind a non-Hollywood-style ending.",1158105600,2,1281,4.787330316742081

Lonely, retired Mr. Lazarescu becomes ill one night. His neighbors call an ambulance, and he's taken on a bizarre tour of Bucharest's hospitals, each of which shuffles him over to the next.

I can understand the negative reviews here. By necessity, THE DEATH of MR. LAZARESCU is bleak, repetitive, and confined in settings. I can also understand its being a labeled a comedy, though it's one of the very darkest sort. While definitely not for those who want fast action, sophisticated effects, and/or just something really fun and uplifting, the acting is so natural and the cinematography so plainly real that DML becomes one of those films that will completely immerse a willing audience.

As a satire of medical care for the poor, aged, and unconnected, there's nothing more effective. Using simple narrative, it shows what so many recent documentaries have merely tried to show. While set in a fairly small Eastern European nation, it's likely to strike a chord just about anywhere. Though non-Romanian audiences may have to do some quick look-ups and online translations, there is clever symbolism--more subtle but just as apt as the name of the protagonist--in the names of the doctors, nurses, and facilities.",1369785600,2,1230,5.109452736318408

2604725,4,B000GBEWMA,"I'm not certain how this film was labeled a comedy.  It's anything but.  This film is commentary on the healthcare system in Bucharest, though it's poignancy reflects the problem of inefficient and care-driven healthcare around the world.  Elderly veteran Mr. Lazarescu is shuttled from hospital to hospital, with no one to advocate for him as his health quickly deteriorates.  Not only is he judged for how he has dealt with his life problems, which has impacted his state of health, but his very serious ailments are minimalized and his fears ignored.  The plight and perspective of Lazarescu is anyone utterly helpless in the healthcare system, who is likely not to survive.  While the repetition of his case gets a bit monotonous, it's entirely realistic and his tension is palpable.  This film accomplishes stirring anxiety and fear as well as any horror film.  It's not graphic in the visual sense, but it deals with mortality head-on, the unkindness of strangers, and the very disturbing process of a body shutting down.  This film should be required viewing for anyone going into the healthcare profession.",1292284800,3,1114,5.076923076923077

2604728,2,B000GBEWMA,"According to many viewers, The Death of Mr. Lazarescu DVD is mislabeled; it is most certainly not a comedy, but more a depressing, painfully sad semi-documentary.  Directed by Romanian Cristi Puiu, the film runs over two hours and the focus reveals a day-in-the-life of a sad old man, alcoholic and sick as his illness takes him from several hospitals, bureaucracy, incompetence, and heightened by uncaring physicians and staff.  This is clearly not funny, and I cannot imagine it ever being intended to be.  But somewhere along, the DVD labels boasts ""the most widely acclaimed comedy of the year"".

Mr. Lazarescu is nearing 63, lives alone with his three cats and has little family further away.  He drinks heavily and becomes sick, complaining that his head hurts. An ambulance aide accompanies him through his journey to wellness, however, he is turned down from hospital to hospital for various reasons.  Much of the dilemma involves overcrowding at the hospitals due to a huge vehicle accident with numerous dead and injured.  This complicates his admittance and care.

The ordeal takes him through the entire night as he encounters rejection, absurdities, bureaucratic policies, etc. etc.  The offensive smell of alcohol remains on his breath as doctors chastise him profusely.  He is not treated with passion and/or kindness.  However, with the constant advocacy of the ambulance aide, we do observe some compassion and concern for a human.

Aside from the pain and anguish of seeing a human mistreated by the medical profession, you can view this has a day in the life or semidocumentary on the health care system.  The movie runs way too long, and often one wonders, (as the DVD cover claims)  ""where is the comedy?""

I can only imagine that the director's intent on the length was to give the viewer a sense of the timeframe, the frustration, the eminent danger of death, the absurdity of the system.  But for the viewer, the over two hours is difficult to endure.  You will hear numerous medical terms, providing a chilling account of the speculation of illness.  The subtitles are clear and easy to read.

Not for the squeamish...... Rizzo",1264291200,4,2152,4.99438202247191
2604729,4,B000GBEWMA,"I rented the film because of the many awards; this may be the first film in a ""new wave"" of Romanian cinema, though I'm not too familiar with the movement; I could be wrong. The DVD I watched had subtitles that were grossly blurred, but it wasn't too hard to figure out what was going on. I'm just sorry I missed some of the clever award-winning dialogue. The DVD extras are plentiful enough, though an interview with the very un-charismatic director, Cristi Puiu, was a drag. The trailer was rife with accolades claiming it to be the best comedy in years. I guess I missed a lot of the black humor, other than a running joke about the ineptitude of the medical system in Romania. This long film, presented in a ""real time"" way, was never dull. Director Puiu created a quasi-documentary, almost like looking over his shoulder at this sweet, goofy guy who calls the paramedics because he's sure he's dying. Veteran actor Ian Fiscuteanu handles this pivotal role with a natural charm and nuance that makes you really care. There's a remarkable performance by Luminta Gheorghiu as the paramedic who accompanies him though the hellish odyssey. Her simple insight belies the intelligece of the hospital workers and doctors who don't seem to know what the hell is wrong with this man. Also, her well staged subtlety makes her a powerful presence. The Romanian condition seems bleak, though real people emerge. The 2007 film ""4 Months..."" was even more bleak, and equally compelling. I'm suddenly interested in the development of Romanian film. Do you think a real knee-slappin' comedy might emerge... soon...ever? That would be interesting.",1260403200,,1634,4.902527075812275
2604730,2,B000GBEWMA,"This was a comedy? Who laughed at it, Josef Mengele? This was a bureaucratic tragedy that moved at a glacial pace, which I suppose was done intentionally so that the viewer could experience the endless indifference of the hospital staffs firsthand, but it killed any sense of urgency. This film is cited by some as a cautionary tale against the ills of socialized medicine, but I've seen news reports of people falling on the floor in U.S. ER's and laying there to die as people step over them and go about their business, so there are breakdowns in all systems. The doctors in this film are more concerned with maintaining their esteemed status at the top of the medical pecking order above the nurses, EMTs and of course patients, rather than devoting their energy to the task at hand. Despite the title of this film, Mr. Lazarescu doesn't die during the course of the film, despite receiving little in the way of treatment, so there is no cathartic moment where the viewers experience any real emotions, other than pity, shame or boredom. I'm trying to demand more from Hollywood, and I can't give foreign films a free pass either when it comes to substandard product, so I can't give this movie more than a failing grade. The acting was top notch, but other than being an overly long exercise in beating the viewer over the head to make a point, it failed to entertain beyond a few moments here and there.",1236729600,3,1409,4.617529880478088

I prefer movies to be somewhat entertaining and not just real.... I probably slept too long to glean anything more than this: that the last few hours of life can be kinda ordinary.

I've just read all the above reviews and I guess I should rewatch it... I doubt anyone will get this far and not realize that it was the intent of the director to make an uber-realistic movie. This time, I'll start watching it much earlier.",1222819200,,756,4.286713286713287
2604732,2,B000GBEWMA,"Painful to sit through. Further proof that not all foreign films are worth your time or money.

Middle section has some humorous moments, but the film itself, for the most part, is
not only laborious, but it takes the filmmaker one hundred and fifty three minutes to get this old, over-weight, alkie geezer to finally kick the bucket.

Want to talk about torture? This is it. And the truth is, I do not mind slow-paced films (whether made in Hollywood or somewhere else) so long as there is something going on (not necessarily killing or action, but something, something, anything gets  me involved somehow...)

The reason I gave it two stars is because I see this as a wake-up call to all the heavy juicers out there who do not believe in any form of excersize... All you have to do is take a look at the tub of lard in this flick to give you a good idea what happens when the only physical activity you know is picking up the beer bottle and/or  remote to change channels. (I only mention it because I've done my share of lifting said beer bottle.)

So, if for no other reason, am glad I sat through this depressing non-motion motion picture.

Now, let me see where Bullitt (starring McQueen) is on the shelf. Might be my 50th viewing, but that's okay...so long as it helps me snap out of the funk  THE DEATH OF MR. LAZARESCU put me in.",1220918400,2,1338,4.388663967611336

This film starts out slowly and I had to force myself to continue. But once Lazarescu gets into the ambulance, I was hooked. It's like rubbernecking at an accident. You know it's gonna be ugly but you just can't look away. To say I enjoyed it would be both accurate and inaccurate. I'm glad I watched it, and will watch it again (if only to listen to the Romanian. It's the one Romance language that I can't get my ears around).
I work and volunteer at a local hospital. I want everyone to watch this.  I knew I'd be thinking of the US healthcare system while I watched this. You will, too. You can't help but compare in ways positive and negative.

2604734,4,B000GBEWMA,"Billed as a ""black comedy,"" there's little funny about this film, which narrates the slow demise of a sick old man caught in a culture of hostility and indifference.

Lazarescu lives alone with his cats in a dingy Romanian apartment block. He rinks too much and is not well-liked by his neighbors. An unusual headache prompts him to self-medicate and finally to call for an ambulance. Everyone around him -- neighbors, ambulance drivers, doctors, medical technicians --is unsympathetic, barely competent or too caught up in person squabbles and ego games to pay attention to this rapidly sickening old man. The level of indifference to human suffering is always underplayed, but devastating nonetheless as Lazarescu is bounced from one overloaded hospital to another on the night of a fatal multi-car pileup.

""Death of"" functions as an anti-parable about what happens when cultures lose empathy. The strong survive and the old, sick and disconnected are disposed of --  kindly, unintentionally but efficiently nonetheless.  Though he film has a few running ""gags"" -- repeated disgust by caregivers at their patient's drinking habit -- the action is portrayed realistically, like an episode of COPS focusing on paramedics.

Kudos to the entire cast and to the writers for mostly keeping the scenarios and characters believable. Special kudos to Ion Fiscuteanu for his realistic portrayal of a man slowly sinking into the depths of illness. His deepening inability to express himself was tragi-comic and convincing, not an easy task. A DVD extra had an American doctor giving a silly 'It could not happen here"" speech. Anyone who has experienced the US healthcare system -- with its focus on profit, time-efficiency and patient-free metrics -- would see that our system has more than its share of shortcomings.

While perhaps an exaggeration of the way medicine is practiced in Romania and elsewhere, ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"" will leave an indelible imprint in your mind.",1215561600,3,1974,5.211356466876971
2604735,5,B000GBEWMA,"The Death of Mr Lazarescu is the most important film of the year. It is also the most important Romanian film ever made. And yet, most people won't see it because it's Romanian and because it's about the death of a man in reality. Well, friends, you're missing out big time.

Although being billed as a black comedy, what you have is closer to tragedy. You're watching the dehumanisation of the man next door. You're watching as this apparently normal ageing man is mocked, disrespected and disregarded from hospital to hospital, by doctors, nurses...they don't care that this man may be dying or that he may be in pain, they really don't care. What's that tell you? The importance of this film lies in the way it makes us more human. You swallow back disgust for yourself and others, you die side by side with Lazarescu, and you're reborn the better for it.

The Death of Mr Lazarescu is, to use a well-deserved clich, a labour of love. The script, the acting, the ideas, the timing, the lighting, the angles - it all works. And no amount of art-house awards or Oscar ignorance can take away the impact that this masterful composition has. Is Puiu the next Kieslowski? Will the rest of the films in the series be as great? Can an intelligent filmmaker reach out to the general public? We'll see.

It is a long journey, one in which he is stripped of everything but his name. Would he have done better to have stayed at home?

Winner of the Un Certain Regard prize at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, this incomparable film, is less a statement about any health care system as it is a testament to the power of detachment. There is zero sentimentality. Yet, I came away with a profound sense of death, loss, and eventually, of lightness. The last words of director Christi Puiu, at the end of a revealing interview included on this DVD, are: ""We all die and we all die alone.""

The brilliance of this film certainly hinges on the subtle naturalness of the actors. Lazarescu, played by Ion Fiscuteanu, is not an especially endearing character, but by the end of the film I felt a closeness to him that bordered on love. (Ironically, this excellent actor died of colon cancer in December, 2007.) Also outstanding is Luminita Gheorghiu (4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days), who plays the steadfast paramedic.

Except for the ambulance rides through a rainy nightscape, the shots are almost entirely interior. One handheld camera (it seems) catches all the garish colors of modern life, the bumbling movements of everyday people and the impatience they have with drunks.

I laugh at the bureaucracy he encounters, the vanity of the doctors, and the petty concerns of the health care workers. It seems distant because he is in Romania and I am in the USA but it is nonetheless quite familiar. Romanian health care seems inefficient and ineffective but nonetheless benign because the participants seem unaware of the consequences of their actions and thereby somehow less responsible. And then in one moment in one scene it is made completely clear that the participants are in fact completely aware of the consequences of their actions. The participants are going to let Mr. Lazarescu die through their deliberate and inadvertent actions and inactions. He will die for their convenience and carelessness and pettiness. That at the end of the day, Mr. Lazarescu has been murdered but no one individual or group can or will be held accountable. In that moment my amusement turned to a silent grim horror that grew and grew until the inevitable conclusion of the movie. This is a rare and unique movie that reveals the true horror of the banal everyday evil that surrounds us in our lives.

2604740,5,B000GBEWMA,"Mr. Lazarescu is an elderly man living in a rather messy apartment with several cats in Bucharest, Romania. He has some health problems and seeks the help of neighbors whose suggestions do not improve his condition. His only daughter emigrated to Canada, so she is too far away to help. It takes some convincing on his part via the phone to get the ambulance to come but they eventually understand his needs. The female ambulance worker shows some compassion, examines him and takes him to the nearest hospital.

Unfortunately, there was a multi-car crash involving a bus on the freeway and many accident victims are taken to the emergency rooms (ERs) of nearby hospitals. The ER was packed and very busy. Mr. Lazarescu gets a quick exam but what he really ends up with is a lecture to stop drinking and he would get better. The ambulance personnel realize he is in pain and needs help ... so they take him to the next hospital. At the next facility, the personnell, both MDs, nurses, and technicians are rather indifferent and treat the female ambulance worker rather shabbily. Eventually, they do a somewhat better exam and agree on a diagnosis. They recommend a CT scan which can not be done in their facility because they do not have the equipment. They are given the necessary paperwork and move on to a third hospital. At this better equipped hospital, Mr. Lazarescu gets his tests not because he *should* nor because it is the right thing to do but *only* because the female ambulance worker has some ""pull"". She knows one of the healthcare workers who arranges for the test to be done immediatly.

A CT scan of the head is done showing he has a serious problem ... the matter is urgent. The physician tries to talk Mr. Lazarescu into having surgery. With much difficulty, they end up convincing him to sign the surgical permit/operating consent. There is no effort made to notify the next of kin or get their permission. It does not seem to matter that Mr. Lazarescu has no understanding of his condition nor is he aware of what he agreed to. Some OR technicians indifferently prepare him for surgery ...

The film reveals the failures of a socialized healthcare system via dark humor. It shows how inhumane, cold and uncaring people can be who have no sense of responsibility or accountability to the patient. Mr. Lazarescu is not given respect or shown compassion. The indifference to his plight is appalling. No one seems sensitive to his healthcare problems except the female ambulance worker. It seemed like a camera crew was filming the the true and actual events in the life of this man. The acting was superb by the main characters as well as by all the healthcare workers. The film is a huge success because one can see the insensitivity, the lack of guilt, the self-absorption of the healthcare workers and unfortunately these attitudes *can* develop in any healthcare system, not just in the socialized type. While the shuttling of Mr. Lazarescu from one hospital ER to the next would *not* occur in the U.S.A. due to EMTALA laws, the fact is under *any* healthcare system the care of the elderly patients can suffer and erode into indifference.

2604742,4,B000GBEWMA,"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu (Cristi Puiu, 2005)

When, at the end of a film, you are pounding on things, throwing things across the room, and yelling how you're going to fly across the ocean and strangle the director, there is one inescapable conclusion to be reached: that film has done its job, and admirably. The Death of Mr. Lazarescu does just that, though there is nothing at all admirable about the film itself; that is one of the sources of its power.

Lazarescu (Ion Fiscuteanu) is a sixty-two-year-old widower living in squalor with three cats. He gets up one morning with a headache, to which a stomachache is later added. Self-medication doesn't work, so he calls the hospital and asks them to send an ambulance. Thus begins a six-hour trip through the Romanian socialized health system that is absurd, outrageous, and all too plausible. Things are complicated by a massive bus crash that has every ER in Bucharest overflowing. Lazarescu's only champion is Mioara (Code Inconnu's Luminita Gheorghiou), the paramedic who originally came to pick him up.

It is all too easy to fall into identifying with Lazarescu and Mioara here, and Puiu has certainly given us some characters who embody everything that is horrible about medical care; I can't imagine anyone watching this movie and not watching to perform some amateur brain surgery on a couple of these doctors. I'm not sure, however, that that was the entirety of Puiu's intention here. If he's wanted to create a one-dimensional screed against the Romanian health care system, he'd have made it, well, a lot more one-dimensional. Instead, there are a number of health care workers here (Mioara is the most notable, but a number of the others are also praiseworthy) who, despite various levels of stress and exhaustion, do their best to make sure that Lazarescu gets the treatment he needs. While, ultimately, none of them are successful (and this is not a spoiler; the title of the film tells you all you need to know, doesn't it?), a number of them try. There's a lot more under the hood here than one might expect, given most reviews of the film to date. Matters are made worse by the ephemerality of the relationships everyone in the film, save Mioara, have with Lazarescu; none of the others is with him long enough to get a decent idea of his condition. We see him sliding further and further into dementia; the medical professionals, to a person, put it down to his being drunk. (And judging by the recipe for the alcohol he's been drinking given to Mioara by Lazarescu's neighbor at the beginning of the film, that's not entirely surprising.) The film is as frustrating for the fact that the viewer can understand the positions of both sides as it is for the horrendous way in which Lazarescu is treated.

I have to say that if this is an example of a Romanian comedy, I'd hate to see what they produce as a tearjerker. I've never seen a comedy this bleak. However, it's also the case that few comedies I've seen are anywhere near as compelling. I'll add my voice to the ever-growing pile recommending this film with all our collective heart. **** ",1178841600,7,3120,4.749077490774908
2604743,5,B000GBEWMA,"The genius of writer and director Cristi Puio (b. 1967) is that he makes the viewer care about poor Mr. Lazarescu, a smelly old drunk who is slowly dying before our eyes. He is shuttled by a kind nurse from hospital to hospital where he is mistreated by everyone who is an authority figure. The nurse endures humiliation by a wise-guy gum-cracking young doctor just so she can ensure proper treatment for the dying 68-year-old man.

This is cinema verite at its finest. Grim is the only word to describe the film as we chug to the inevitable climax. This is not a pretty movie but it is so truthful it's hard to believe every character is an actor and not a real person.",1177891200,3,670,4.403225806451613
2604744,5,B000GBEWMA,"This is not a Hollywood-style motion picture. It is neither spectacular nor unpredictable. The outcome--after all--is announced in the title. What defines this movie is its incredible realism, in addition to a clear sense of time--wasted time, that is--and missed opportunities. A man is dying and nobody cares. Long, hand-held camera shots record his agony and helplessness in real time, as he faces bureaucracy, incompetence and indifference. While none of the caretakers takes responsibility, our patient undergoes inadequate exams and exhaustive testing without a single intervention aimed at saving his life. Worse, throughout the ordeal, Mr. Lazarescu is robbed of the most important tools in the arsenal of quality medicine: respect, dignity, and empathy. The viewer is left speechless, hoping that our hero's experience could not have occurred in real life. However. . . . remember the realism? Thumbs up to a great European movie! And--if I am allowed--a remainder that, despite its imperfections, the U.S. healthcare system is more desirable. . . .",1177113600,4,1058,5.4573170731707314
2604745,4,B000GBEWMA,"This was a long movie, not only in actual length but *perceived* length. The story of poor, sick Mr. Lazarescu is a tragic - and sadly realistic - one, and we know that it was told at this pace to give us an idea of what it must have felt like for him: sick, nauseous, in need of immediate surgery.

We watch, baffled, as he shuttled from one hospital to the next, with everyone agreeing that something needs to be done but other than one of the nurses with him in the ambulance, nobody seems to want to do anything.

While this is intended as a critique of the inadequacies of the Romanian health care system, it could just as well be a critique of any U.S. county run hospital, where there are far too many people, and far too few workers.

This should serve as a reminder to anyone not taking good care of their health to get with it - you don't want to end up like Mr. Lazarescu.",1174867200,6,883,4.152046783625731

The film is realistic, with rare moments of humor and also occasional poignant moments, but ultimately is tedious and almost painfully long.  Yes, you catch a glimpse into a medical system where no one is really responsible for, nor really cares about, Mr. Lazarescu's life.  The situation differs so much from the view we're weaned on, where doctors race to solve problems, that it is valuable to learn about.  The editorial comment that one can visualize how ""suffocatingly slow time must seem"" for Mr. Lazarescu is absolutely correct, but only because time feels that ""suffocatingly slow"" for the viewer as well: I saw this movie in theatre and wished I could have gotten up from my seat (in the middle of the aisle) and walked out.",1173312000,,854,4.75

The Romanian film ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"" is a 147-minute fictional drama that plays out almost entirely in what documentary filmmakers like to refer to as ""real time.""  Lazarescu is a 62-year-old widower who lives with his three beloved cats in a rundown apartment in Bucharest.  Even though he had an operation for a stomach ulcer 14 years earlier, Lazarescu still drinks excessively, perhaps as a means of assuaging his loneliness or perhaps because he is simply an alcoholic.  As the movie begins, Lazarescu is suffering from a severe headache, stomach pains and vomiting, so he calls for an ambulance to come and take him to the hospital.  The movie is a slice-of-life chronicle of that trip.

This is all the ""story"" director Cristi Puiu provides us with as we see Lazarescu being shuffled from one hospital and emergency room to another by a compassionate middle-aged paramedic named Mioara.  Puiu clearly has some sharp things to say about the care - or in some cases, LACK of care - Lazarescu receives at the hands of a medical system that is overstretched and undermanned, filled with doctors who are often petty and ill-tempered towards not only their patients but even the paramedics whom the doctors perceive as being clearly ""beneath"" them in training and knowledge (the irony is that Mioara is more accurate in her diagnosis of the patient than a number of the doctors who examine him).  However, Puiu also shows us doctors and nurses who perform their jobs admirably and treat the ill with kindness.  Actually, the best thing about ""The Death of Lazarescu"" is that it observes without judgment.  We really feel as if we are seeing life unfolding in front of us without so much as a trace of phoniness, melodramatics or theatricality to dilute the vision.  The scenes come off as totally spontaneous and unscripted, as the director (along with co-writer Razvan Radulescu) chronicles the lives of these various people whose paths just happen to cross on this one hectic Saturday night in Bucharest.  With the use of a handheld camera to record the action, Puiu makes us feel as if we ourselves are along for the ride, being afforded this rare, behind-the-scenes glimpse into not only this medical drama but the countless little truths about human behavior Puiu reveals along the way.

The film would not be the tremendous success it is were it not for the extraordinary performances from each and every member of its amazing cast, from Ion Fiscuteanu as Lazarescu to Luminta Gheorghiu as the paramedic, to all the various men and women who appear on screen as neighbors, doctors, nurses, drivers, technicians etc.  Their performances are all so unmannered and lifelike that you would swear you were watching a documentary feature rather than a fictional narrative.  Fiscuteanu, in particular, delivers a tour-de-force turn here as a man fighting not only the ravages of illness and pain, but the indignities that come along with being passively bandied about among various doctors and hospitals and being subjected to withering comments from medical personnel resentful of having to ""fix"" someone whose problems all seemingly stem from alcoholism (this attitude actually leads to a careless misdiagnosis on the part of one of the doctors).

The film clearly doesn`t sugarcoat reality but neither does it make it appear worse than it actually is, which is often the case with movies that try to capture life ""in the raw"" as it were. ""The Death of Lazarescu"" manages to capture life's rawness without resorting to the kind of excessive narcissism or hyperbole that lesser artists would have used.

And that is the triumph of ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu.""  It draws us so deeply into its world and makes us so familiar with the people who inhabit it that we don't really feel as if we are watching a movie at all.  Rarely have 147 minutes passed so quickly.",1168646400,33,3882,4.9173047473200615
2604750,2,B000GBEWMA,"'The Death of Mr. Lazarescu,' the critics' darling and a noble entry from Romania, revolves around the titled elderly man (Ion Fiscuteanu) who suffers from nausea and a terrible headache that won't go away.  He lives alone in his apartment, and we can't feel anything but empathy as we painfully go through his whole ordeal.  He calls the ambulance several times, but no one shows.  He tries to get some medicine from his neighbors, who are accomodating, if not disinterested and look upon his plight as a distraction.  They give him the first of at least a dozen lectures about his drinking.  (He had a glass of the Romanian equivalent of moonshine, but his real problems are revealed in a series of bureaucratic maneuvers that will give the audience nausea and a headache as well.)  When the ambulance finally comes we get the first of another dozen inquiries:  What are your symptoms, Mr. Lazarescu?  How long have you been experiencing this...?  When help arrives, A female paramedic (Luminta Gheorghina) is perhaps his best ally.  It is not always clear if she cares about him, however, or if she wants to do her job well, but she's there for him throughout the night.  We go along for the ride--or I should say rides--and all the paperwork in each hospital.  (Four? or was it five?)  A serious accident has taken place, and staff and room has been stretched to the fullest.  Besides their lack of humane treatment and long hours, they seem to be absorbed in their own affairs.  Friends meet into one another; doctors make personal cell phone calls, etc...Then, when we get the real diagnosis, Mr. Lazarescu is probably so vexed, he can only resign to the inevitable.

There are not really any villains in this film.  The situation is unbearable and in some ways it translates into a difficult viewing experience.  While the movie elicits compassion for the poor, unloved man--as well as a few bitter chuckles, I found '...Mr. Lazarescu' more educational than entertaining.  Perhaps it's this reviewer's fault, even selfishly, that I kept wishing I could see the 'Sixty Minutes' version of this film. (Of course that would ruin the purpose and impetus of the whole movie.)

The film, through the experiences of one this one individual, shows how we can consistently, and thoughtlessly let each other down, in a myriad of small careless ways. I found it thought provoking, and sensitive. Walking in the path of Mr. Lazarescu, you'll find yourself wanting to, perhaps, break through the isolation and find a way to become more a more aware, compassionate, understanding and caring person.

8130526,4,B000GBEWMA,"Since 1986, emergency rooms in the United States have been subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires them to provide treatment regardless of the patient's ability to pay or other considerations.  In this film, which takes place in Romania, the titular character finally agrees to go to the ER after suffering all day from vomiting and a headache, surely exacerbated by his consumption of a horrific local drink.  I didn't catch the exact recipe, but it sounded like a mixture of Everclear, cinnamon, garlic, and pickle juice.

For various reasons, no one wants to treat him, so he is shuttled from one hospital to another, despite the fact that he is suffering from both terminal cancer and a subdural hematoma, a condition typically requiring immediate surgery.  Maybe the lack of care is a holdover from the Ceaucescu era, where the outlawing of abortion led to severely overcrowded orphanages that housed children in inhuman conditions.  Or, it could be from the same ""treat 'em and street 'em"" mentality one finds in the U.S. as well.  The film also featured several rude and condescending doctors, who were openly contemptuous of Mr. Lazarescu when they smelled his breath, and after he wets himself as his condition gradually deteriorates.  The doctors also angrily dismiss the observations of the paramedic who has the best knowledge of the patient's condition, another aspect of the medical hierarchy, and a realistic observation that anyone who has attempted to second-guess their own doctor can attest to.

Marketed as a comedy in Romania, the film is more a wry commentary on the absurdity of life.  It is marred by some of the worst subtitles I have ever seen, in an outline font that required more effort to read than should have been necessary.",1402963200,2,1796,5.0
