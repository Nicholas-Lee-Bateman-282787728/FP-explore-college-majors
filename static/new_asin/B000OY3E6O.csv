8187680,5,B000OY3E6O,"I love this video.  Kim is upbeat, motivating, and comes off as genuine which makes it so easy to listen to her during the workout.  She, along with Kelly Coffey and Jessica Smith, are my favorite instructors.

This workout can be broken down into sections based on what you are looking for.  I use her cardio kickboxing premix (just a bit under 70 minutes) which is basically the entire video minus the weighted bar section.  I do have a weighted bar but it is a 15 pound bar and being that heavy makes some of her moves pull on my muscles in a way that does not feel safe for me.  To her credit, Kim says your bar should be no more than 8 pounds.  I simply don't have one that weight.

The video consists of a warm up, a little over 30 minutes of cardio, a little under 30 minutes of weighted bar exersices, around 15 minutes of abs, a ""cool down"" which I love because it is short and has a focus on balance, and a stretch.  These can be done all together or separately.  She has great premixes set up.  I simply can't say enough about this video.  I've used it, along with her husband's (Rob Glick) power body strength training video as well as the other two instructors I mentioned above to lose 50 pounds in 6 months and I still use them today to make sure those 50 pounds don't find their way back.",1411430400,3,1304,4.192771084337349
8187681,5,B000OY3E6O,I bought this for my sister who needed it for some ideas on teaching kickboxing for a job interview. She thought it was great.,1370736000,,126,4.291666666666667
8187682,4,B000OY3E6O,"This is a great kickboxing workout. Awesome for both lower and upper body work.  Kimberely Spreen is very personable and I love the extra core workout. You don't need a ton of room, but if you have it you can utilize that. It isn't so jumpy jumpy, and I am still getting a great cardio workout. I don't care for the ""dragon"" to much, but if that is my only 'beef' with it that is a pretty good and still worth the money!",1231718400,,420,4.0602409638554215
8187683,4,B000OY3E6O,"This is a good workout, it was a bit easy for me since I have done in the past Tae Bo, so I found this workout good, but too easy for me",1225756800,,136,3.28125
8187684,5,B000OY3E6O,"This is a fun workout and it works you hard! The music is great and timed really well to give you that extra motivational push when you need it, I like Kim's personality and style, her cueing is very good, and she puts together some really fun combinations.

In addition to the kickbox combos, she does 3 or 4 combos with a weighted bar, I love variety in my workouts, and this certainly adds it, the bar really gives your arms an extra workout, and some of the moves feel really warrior like, also lots of fun.

I have not made it all the way through the ab work yet, it's a little long for me, but seems effective.",1224720000,,616,4.168067226890757
8187685,5,B000OY3E6O,"What a great workout. I love this DVD and Kimberly is such a great lead. She motivates and cues perfectly. I have two of her other DVD's as well and this is my favorite. I felt it in my waist, hips,legs and abs the next day. Can't wait to do it again.",1215993600,,251,3.8461538461538463
