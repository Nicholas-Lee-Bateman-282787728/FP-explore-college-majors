8068917,3,B0009X5GL6,"In this 50's TV comedy series, the private secretary to talent agent Peter Sands (Don Porter), Susan Camille MacNamara (Ann Sothern) goes out of her way to help her boss in the most convoluted schemes. Some how she always puts her foot in it; yet in the end everything turns out fine.

Either a victim of old age or bad memory (possible the world has changed); I found this series to be straining for laughs.

The DVD volume one contains:
""Cat in a Hot Tin File""
""Dollars and Sense""
""Old Dogs, New Tricks""
""That's no Lady, That's an Agent""

If you enjoyed the acting of Don Porter then you should not miss him in the Bob Hope classic ""Bachelor in Paradise"" (1961)

The version I watched was distributed by alpha video and was not remastered (it really should have been). The images do not hold up well on today's big screen TV's",1523318400,,828,4.427631578947368
8068918,5,B0009X5GL6,"I have other discs from other manufactures of Private Secretary, and this disc far exceeds the quality.  I notice that it says digitally restored on it.  It truly is the best copy yet that I have seen of this show.  I hope that this company restores other good old shows too.  They all deserve to look their very best so new generations can enjoy them and they can actually be seen and heard properly with being digitally restored.  Please restore other good old shows such as Pete and Gladys, The Gale Storm show, The Life of Riley, Duffys Tavern, Suspense tv show, ect.  Thank you for such a great product!!!!!",1469059200,,612,4.5181818181818185

8068921,4,B0009X5GL6,"Spectacular, classic television situation comedy. Great fun as Ann Sothern stars as Susie, private secretary for Peter Sands (played by Don Porter), a New York City talent agent. Susie is constantly involved in life or office dramas and endless schemes to salvage her life or job. Ann Sothern plays the part perfect and Ann Tyrrell as Vi, her timid co-worker is wonderful. The scripts are well written. Plus, Ann as Susie is a proverbial fashion plate.

Private Secretary premiered on the CBS network during September 12, 1954 and continued until September 10, 1957. Then the episodes were nationally re-released via syndication under the title ""Susie.""

The four episodes on this disc are from later syndication prints with the syndication title ""Susie"". But, the content is the same as the original Private Secretary episodes except they may be one or two minutes shorter per episode in order to accomodate sponsor messages and commercials. This was the beginning of the endless erosion of program material to accomdate sponsors and advertisers.

These episodes are from very good prints which I rate at 8 - 8.5 out of 10. The first episode is Cat On a Hot Tin Roof, which was orignally broadcast during March 18, 1956. If you like cats you will love this episode.

""Elusive"" is the second episode originally broadcast during June 10, 1956. ""Dollars and Sense"" is the third episode originally broadcast during November 25, 1956. ""Efficiency Expert"" is the fourth episode and it was originally broadcast during February 17, 1957.

Meanwhile, during October 6, 1958 ""The Ann Sothern Show"" premiered on CBS. Ann played the assistant manager of a New York City hotel. Her boss was played by Ernest Truex but in mid-season he was replaced by Don Porter playing ""Mr. Devery.""

I highly recommend this disc especially if you can buy the disc for $2.00 or less. Susie is a doozie.",1215129600,2,1874,4.9712460063897765
8068922,4,B0009X5GL6,"Since the other reviewer has listed the shows, I will not do that here. I wish all reviewers would learn that what we all want most is a list of shows, the number of discs, etc....all the info that Amazon mostly leaves unknown. There are some dark backgrounds and muddy scenes here, and nothing special with the sound, but still I bought all 4 volumes in this Critic's Choice collection. Considering the other company Amazon carries gives you the same 4 shows and charges 2 dollars more, these are your best buys. As long as they stay on Amazon's 4 for 3 special, you only pay 3.75 per disc. I loved this show as a teenager and I still do. Good plots, great characters, good acting, good sets, and Ann Southern. Who could ask for more? I COULD!! SOMEBODY PLEASE PUT OUT THE WHOLE SERIES!!!",1174694400,6,789,4.448275862068965
8068923,4,B0009X5GL6,"PRIVATE SECRETARY stars Ann Sothern as Susie MacNamara, the meddlesome secretary to New York talent mogul Peter Sands (Don Porter).  Susie often gets confused as to the limitations of her job and becomes frequently entangled in the lives of Peter and his clients.  Snappy dialogue and great comic support is provided by Ann Tyrrell as Susie's workmate Vi Praskins.  The show originally ran on the CBS network from 1954-57, and later went under the title of ""Susie"" for syndicated re-runs.

Ann Sothern is the perfect anchor for the show; her brittle, no-nonsense comedy style holds the series together, and her chemistry with Don Porter is undeniable.  Ann Tyrrell steals many scenes as daffy receptionist Vi.

This volume of episodes from Critics Choice includes:

""Cat in a Hot Tin File"" - When a stray cat wanders into the office, Susie and Vi decide to keep it, despite Peter's new actress client Edmee Esmond (guest-star Jean Parker) being allergic.  Original airdate 18th March 1956.

""Elusive"" - In an obvious homage to New York's most reclusive screen legend Greta Garbo, Susie and Peter attempt to coax a former screen star back into the limelight.  Original airdate 10th June 1956.

""Dollars and Sense"" - In an effort to try and curb her spendthrift habits, Susie begs Peter and Vi to help in organising her finances.  Original airdate 25th November 1956.

""The Efficiency Expert"" - Susie becomes suspicious when Peter discusses plans to merge his talent agency with a rival one.  Original airdate 17th February 1957.
