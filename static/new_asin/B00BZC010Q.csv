8575788,1,B00BZC010Q,"1)  The description says languages are English and Spanish.  It's Spanish, only, with only English subtitles available.  My wife doesn't understand Spanish and hates subtitles.  I bought it so she could enjoy it, too, in English.

2)  The resolution is awful.  The opening and closing credits are so fuzzy they're unreadable.  I like to learn about what I watch without going to imbd.com

3)  To watch the movie you have to sit through almost 15 minutes of advertising for the distributor, and you can't skip over it.  These are movies sold in packages, not by the original producers of the films.  That's probably why the quality is so low, and there are no language or feature options.  These are the ones you find at Wal-Mart, etc, for a buck or two.  Avoid movies by this distributor - I now know better.",1473552000,,808,4.638297872340425

8575792,5,B00BZC010Q,"This is a lovely, sweet movie, with a bit of black humor throughout. It gave me warm fuzzies, it made me laugh at things I probably shouldn't have, it made me cry, and it taught me some interesting vocabulary :) It is very much a ""chick flick"" but it instantly became one of my favorites.",1392940800,,288,4.254545454545455
