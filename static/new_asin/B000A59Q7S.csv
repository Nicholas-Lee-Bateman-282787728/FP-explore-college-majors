8074563,4,B000A59Q7S,"This product is published by Coaches Choice and is clearly aimed at coaches. Coach Wender frequently refers to ""your swimmer"". I think it's aimed at people who have some experience swim coaching and are looking for new information, guidance and drills to use.

That said, the drills and Coach Wender's philosophies were the most useful and valuable things to get out of this product for a self-coaching swimmer. Some of the drills were not new, like Fingertip Drag Drill. But many were new, and I plan on incorporating them into my training.

The entire technique of freestyle is not explained. It's not for a complete beginner in that way. But the concepts of streamline, balance and axis of rotation would have been nice to know when I first learned to swim rather than reteaching myself.

$40 does seem a little high. The DVD quality wasn't exceptional. But I really like it and would recommend it if you can find it a little cheaper.",1300924800,,937,4.736196319018405
8074564,1,B000A59Q7S,"Together, this video and the backstroke one are a total rip-off. Like the other reviewer said, much of the two are exactly the same. They show freestyle swimming on the backstroke DVD and vice versa. The bulk of the instruction is on different drills to do, almost all focusing on hip rotation, with a minuscule amount about kicking. Neither one says anything about arm movement, and you can't get a good idea of what the arm movement is supposed to be from the video. The DVD quality is bad -- it looks like it was converted from an old video tape. I didn't buy this video, just borrowed it from the library, and even for that I could not recommend wasting your time on it.",1280016000,,674,4.4
8074565,5,B000A59Q7S,"Basic Freestyle Swimming Technique features a progressive system of skills and drills that is focused on perfecting the basic elements of successful and efficient swimming. The program details a systematic process for developing the crawl stroke ""from the inside out."" The fundamentals and techniques involved in efficiently performing the freestyle stroke are also explained and shown.

Topics covered: streamlining and body position; balance and rotation; flutter kick and underwater travel; arm stroke and anchoring; rhythm and timing; developmental drills; putting it all together.",1213401600,,585,6.048192771084337
8074566,2,B000A59Q7S,"I feeled being cheated when I bought this dvd and another dvd from the

same coache: basic backstrokes swimming technique for these reasons:

 1. More than half of the 2 dvds are exactly the same things, just a duplicate scenes.

 2. No underwater camera, can not see the body movements clear.

 3. A lot of talks that are not useful for learning.

 4. The prices are too high compared with other sellers.

 5. More like this dvd aim at teenagers, not for adults",1162166400,11,462,4.445783132530121
