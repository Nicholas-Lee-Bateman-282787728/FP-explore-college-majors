8262054,1,B0016APVUW,"The four sets listed here are ALL the WISEGUY episodes that were originally  released.

The music arc (Dead Dog Records) has never been released  - rumor said it was because the record companies wanted WAY too much money to allow their recordings (and artists?) to be included in the DVD sets.  (I think that was very short-sighted of them -- could have introduced Debbie Harry aka Blondie to new generations, and Tim Curry's ""Rocky Horror"" fans would probably have picked that set up.)

The more recent ""Collector's Edition, Seasons 1 - 4"" one-box set put out by Mill Creek does include the episodes at the end of the music arc (Vinnie and Amber Twine trying to sort out their feelings for each other  while dealing with a sleazy lawyer) and several Steven Bauer episodes (the new  ""Wiseguy"" after Ken Wahl left) on two discs.  There are a total of 67 episodes on 13 discs. The set does suffer from somewhat heavy-handed editing, which seems to be par for the course with Mill Creek.

(Speaking of music, the last song  in the movie theater / jukebox scene was originally ""Knights in White Satin"" -- not the pallid instrumental on the dvds.)

If you want to see WISEGUY as originally broadcast, buy the original four-volume set.

(Don'[t know why, but the page won't let me rate this as five stars.)",1367625600,9,1300,4.6535087719298245
8262055,5,B0016APVUW,There were supposed to be 6 sets in this collection.  Methinks the manufacturer has gone defunct.  I will keep these sets until someone decides to reissue them and the episodes that have not been released.  I think we have to ask Cannell what's up with that :-(,1207958400,18,261,4.51063829787234
