What impressed me most is that those guys lived through the fire, the collision, and the power outages and were able to talk about it. I can't believe this isn't available on DVD or Blu Ray. OMG! These incidents actually ocurred 18 years and a decade after the alleged Apollo 18 Top Secret Mission. Remember, this was all caught on film. This is one of the best Documentaries I've ever seen.",1378684800,,509,4.666666666666667
7889359,5,6305373787,"This is a must see to understand the evolution of space exploration. It explains why there is an international space station and not national ones. It probes into the the psyche of the Russian people: talented, poetic, brooding, long suffering, patient, and humiliated. It also probes into the psyche of Russian leadership: secretive, arrogant, autocratic, condescending, and potentially dangerous. I get upset every time I show this film to my physics class.",1129507200,2,459,5.388888888888889
