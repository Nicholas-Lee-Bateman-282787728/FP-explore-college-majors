1425529,5,B00005IA7Z,"One of my all-time favourite films this is an example of first class cinema. Jeff Bridges and John Heard are unlikely friends, more friends of convienience though at the heart there is something solid. A lot of reviews of this film state that its too simple - a murder mystery in essence and a partial study of relationships. Though its more than that for me, its a study of the best and worse of people AND the weary way one can live ones life if we let life get on top of us. Bone (Jeff Bridges) is totally tired of life - seeking thrills if he can be bothered - only deciding on a life changing course of action in the final frame of this film. Cutter (John Heard) is a drunk Veteran - immoral to everyone but those truly close to him.
Im trying to not give too much away but I consider this to be a truly classic film. And what a score!
My apologies for a rambling review - watch this.",1010534400,17,889,4.114942528735632
1425530,5,B00005IA7Z,"The alcoholic, blasphemous and ""crippled"" Cutter would not please Arnold fans. But for his crowd, he pulls out a heartbreaking display of bravery and follows his paranoia until the very end.
We have seen men like him on screen before, but they lacked the willingless to sacrifice themselves in pursuit of re-gaining self respect and the ability to turn ""no-good"" bystanders (Bone) in the process.
The off beat pace of the movie, the underacting and its noir tones very successfully dims the gut wrenching drama at play, without affecting the suspense.
The suspense? There is more of it in wondering where the Cutter's relentless path to self-destruction might lead to than in solving the murder mystery at play.
Simply worth watching for John Heard's perfect depiction of Cutter. Bridges (Bone) and Eichhorn are excellent as well.",1006214400,23,830,5.110294117647059
1425531,2,B00005IA7Z,"Initially released as ""Cutter and Bone"", this movie was pulled from theatres and retitled after several critics panned it.  Inexplicably, it became a film festival favorite and developed a minor cult following upon its re-release.  My verdict?  Those early critical drubbings were well-deserved.  For despite a potentially dynamic plot setup and one successful performance, the movie is ultimately done in by a lackluster screenplay, some uneven acting, and substandard direction.
It all begins promisingly enough, with a fascinating title sequence followed by the introduction of Jeff Bridges as a two-bit gigolo who becomes a suspect in a murder investigation.  So far, so good.  Then John Heard enters as an obnoxious, bigoted, profane Vietnam vet-cum-amateur detective who uses his physical disabilities to excuse his ethical and moral shortcomings, and S-s-s-s! The plot quickly deflates into a slow, muddled study of his unpleasant character, losing its promising elements of suspense and mystery, and leaving the actors with the impossible burden of maintaining audience interest.  Tellingly, Bridges, who can convey character nuances with a subtle flicker of his eyes or shift of his lips, is great in his role; but Heard, who relies mainly on a gruff laugh and a gravelly voice that wavers unsteadily between slurring and over-enunciation, is merely grating in his.  As Heard's wife, the usually fascinating Lisa Eichhorn is thwarted in her underwritten and choppily edited role, and Ann Dusenberry -- whose odd character simply disappears without explanation near the end -- recites some of her lines as if they embarrass her (as well they should).  None of the actors is assisted by Ivan Passer's lackadaisical direction, which lacks both energy and cohesion, and only the final abrupt cut that ends this mess shows any prowess on the part of the editor.  Recommended for devotees of the consistently marvelous but underrated Jeff Bridges; other viewers beware!",1003276800,5,1972,5.394136807817589
1425532,4,B00005IA7Z,"Stumbled across this movie by chance. All three leads are superb, giving the kind of charismatic, heroic, complex performances you so rarely see in Hollywood these days; the direction is deceptively simple, but subtly  poetic and moving - it has the same kind of feel as the best of Milos  Forman's American pictures (Cuckoo's Nest etc.), only with it's own gentle  power. It's sort of a Film Noir/Character Study/Dropout Movie. Actually,  waffling aside, it's just one of those movies you either clutch tightly to  your breast after one viewing or aren't really going to care much for.  Well, it got me and even though I'd like to think I found it first and it's  my little secret, I know that's not true... Anyway, watch and enjoy; it's  not perfect, it may not actually be great, but it should stab you in the  heart a little, and take you on the kind of quirky, bumpy ride you might  just need!

1425549,5,B00005IA7Z,"Like the 70's Classic ""Chinatown"" ""Cutter's Way"" channels the paranoia and atmosphere of the great films from that era. Like ""Chinatown"" this really isn't a mystery so much as a suspense thriller driven by the relevations that spring from the imagination of disabled Vietnam vet Alex Cutter (John Heard In a superb Oscar caliber performance) who's anger at the system finds both fuel and a means to vent it around the murder of a 17 year old teen cheerleader dumped in the garbage of Santa Barbara. Cutter's best friend Rich Bone (Jeff Bridges) provides the opportunity when he spots the murderer disposing of the body in an alley way where his car has broken down. ""Cutter's Way"" is a smaller, more intimate character driven suspense thriller in the vein of ""The Parallax View"" except that we don't know what's real and what's driven by Cutter's desire to find an outlet for his anger.

Bridges, Heard and Lisa Eichhorn all give terrific  performances with Eichhorn especially outstanding as Cutter's wife Mo who drowns her sorrows in alcohol to compensate for her unrequited love for Bone and disintegrating marriage to Cutter. Three Oscar caliber performances that were I acknowledged at the time and a film that, even with critical acclaim, (and a modest profit) meant that ""Cutter's Way"" was largely forgotten except by fans of the film. Luckily time has been kinder with a signicant fan based that occurred primarily due to cable exposure.

The Blu-Ray for ""Cutter's Way"" looks extremely good. There are occasion scenes that have white flecks and other analog flaws but the film got some love during the transfer for Twilight Time.

We don't get a lot of extras (I would have loved to hear from Heard especially as this is one of his pivotal career performances that put him up there as one of the best--if unacknowledged--actors of his generation) but interviews with the main actors and director Ivan Passer (who is, as of this writing, still around) would have been nice.

Heard's role is certainly the showier of the three (and was, in fact, earmarked for Dustin Hoffman at one time and Nridges wanted the role as well before being cast as Bone) leads but Bridges subtle performance as a mediocre gigolo very much demands to be reassessed and receives the attention it deserves in an informative commentary track by Nick Redman and Julie Kirgo.

We also get the theatrical trailer and Jack Nitzsche's memorable (and minimalist) score as an isolated track. The film comes with English subtitles as well.

A subtle but powerful masterpiece about the disillusion that followed in the wake of the 60's and 70's, ""Cutter's Way"" is a surprisingly powerful film that has aged remarkably well. The transfer is a huge improvement over the poor DVD with a nice image and color's. Depth is also improved .",1466899200,,2804,4.890526315789474
1425550,4,B00005IA7Z,"Liked it the first time I saw it (when it came out, yikes) and liked it as much this time. A bit mystified by the ending, but with this boozy ""Black Thriller"" the journey is most definitely the reward. A pre-Lebowski Jeff Bridges, who apparently got the part because of his work in, wait for it, ""Heaven's Gate"", is superb. John Heard, who may be one of the most under-rated, and under-used American actors chews the scenery as Alex Cutter, a Vietnam vet who has had trouble 're-engaging' with life. I think this is Heard's best role. The real treat, though, is Lisa Eichhorn as Cutter's long-suffering wife, Mo. A terrific performance anchors a plot in which the center most definitely cannot hold. Heard's character Bone is wrongly considered a person of interest in connection with a Murder, and his buddy Alex decides to make finding the real killer his latest crusade, with unfortunate consequences that I won't spoil. With some questionable choices with respect to soft focus photography, which seems to have been all the rage in the 1980s, Santa Barbara nonetheless looks gorgeous, and provides the perfect counterpoint to the possibly nefarious doings of its wealthy-but-untouchable 1% set. Great stuff, and seems to have aged reasonably well.",1462060800,4,1251,4.990430622009569

The other actors are first rate, too, but these guys stretch out and run  with what they were given. The story is good, direction, photography and scenic set ups are right there, but John Heard is great as an alcoholic, burned up vet with a crappy demeanor, bulldog persistence, and a gravelly appreciation of his well founded class hatred. A character to warm the soul, in my opinion.

1425572,3,B00005IA7Z,"I was prepared to discover a lost American masterpiece and found a mediocre mess of a film.

Jeff Bridges is a natural on screen. But Eichhorn seems to talk into herself; trapped in soft-spoken self-consciousness/-contempt. John Heard tries for bigger-than-life. Rather too hard, and winds up ""acting."" Always painful to watch. His efforts might have been more convincing with a better director. One able to register performances so as to amplify them. But Passer is too concerned to capture the proceedings realistically to play around with abstraction or stylization. What we get feels at once too casual and over-wrought.

I tried to fast-forward my way through the Heard scenes, pretty much eviscerating the film in the process. The desire to move a film forward artificially indicates something's not working. Cutter's Way is one film that was not, unfortunately, ""made in the editing room."" It could have used some paring-down.

The murder-mystery is not allowed to set the tone of the film, or give it direction. Almost as if the killing were not in itself significant, only as the heinous ultimate misdeed of a corrupt corporate type [""McCord'] who acts as a projection screen for all that is vile in the disenchanted eyes of late 70's, Post-Vietnam disgruntlement. There's no nuance or ambivalence about this villain:all evil, he looms monolithically out-of-sight until the end. As a result, the film is ideological, and rather comfortable in its righteous vision of corruption. Instead of challenging us morally, it merely tests our endurance.

For a film that eschews suspense and any emphasis on action, preferring to emerge the viewer in the characters' personalities, the end feels like a betrayal of that focus rather than a resolution. Suddenly a deed becomes the decisive thing. The gunshot is meant to bring the drama to a close, but as an ending feels arbitrary and abrupt. The realization that the gun was actually loaded is the sort of plot point that operates at a thematic level we have been urged to transcend.

Instead of being drawn into a mystery, we are held hostage by disaffected drug-users, unhinged losers and part-time whores, with whom we're supposed to identify. Vincent Canby noted that Cutter's Way is ""enchanted by the sound of its own dialogue, which is vivid without being informative or even amusing on any level."" That about sums it up for me. It's too much of an insider's job.

The whole exercise has a distinctly amateur feel to it. The Framing and lighting are carelessly done. Like that western Peter Fonda directed. It will appeal to those who shared in the malaise of the post-Vietnam era. All the Tiffany lamps and house plants brought back a stylistic era we should all be trying hard to forget.

The DVD is a bit dark, which is apparently faithful to the original. But it is also a bit soft. A bit like the film itself.",1346284800,,2871,4.931677018633541
1425573,5,B00005IA7Z,"When was the last time you watched something original? Plain and simple Cutters Way is gem. It is one of the greatest movies you have never watched. It is one that will seem familiar because many directors have harvested it for original ideas. Cutters Way is a total early 80s mystery that flew completely under the radar. The main reason for that is because you have to do some of thinking yourself. The film stars a young Jeff Bridges as Bone. This is proof that Jeff Bridges had an eye for well written scripts throughout his entire career. He takes the substance and runs with it. Bone is a gigolo who turns out to be a suspect in a random murder case. Bone and his over the top, insane, lunatic friend named Cutter think they know who commuted the murder. Are their accusations based in reality? Possibly. Are they board and completely crazy? Definitely. Ultimately you can decide.
Cutters Way is really about crazy people acting crazy. It succeeds so well because its focus is on the characters and not the plot. For the most part the story is about a murder but the characters are all about booze. The booze of course tends to be much more interesting. The characters are so serious, their insanity is so sincere, you almost believe it. All that and it gets much deeper. If you have yet to see Cutters Way no review can really explain it. If you are a movie fan you will enjoy this one. Do not be afraid to decide for yourself what it all means.",1331424000,3,1452,4.441947565543071
1425574,4,B00005IA7Z,"""Cutter's Way"" is a 1981 neo-noir film that retains a 1970s sensibility, partly because it is based on Newton Thornburg's 1976 novel ""Cutter and Bone"". Directed by Ivan Passer and filmed just before Jeff Bridges' career took off -he would star in the iconic ""Tron"" a year later and become a heartthrob in ""Against All Odds"" two years after that- ""Cutter's Way"" doesn't make full use of his talents, but it's a nice role nevertheless. It might have been known best at the time it was released for United Artists' lack of confidence in the film, but it proved the studio wrong. This was around the time of the sale of United Artists to MGM after the ""Heaven's Gate"" fiasco, so the studio was not in its best form at predicting successes.

Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges) lives an aimless life on his boat and has an eye for the ladies. Driving home one night, his car stalls in an alleyway. Another car pulls up behind, and someone gets out to dump something in a trash can. Perturbed that the other car nearly ran him over, Bone walks home in the rain. When trash collectors find the body of a murdered young woman in that trash can, Bone is taken in for questioning. He can't identify the man he saw in the other car. But the next day, he spots the man in a parade: a ruthless local tycoon, J.J. Cord (Stephen Elliott). Bone thinks he must be mistaken. But his best friend Alex Cutter (John Heard), a one-eyed, one-legged, one-armed, alcoholic Vietnam vet with a chip on his shoulder, wants to try to entrap Cord with a blackmail plot.

That's the ""noir moment"", as Eddie Muller would say. The point at which seemingly normal people do abnormal things. For some reason, Alex thinks that blackmailing Cord is a good way to get him to incriminate himself, rather than just telling the police what they've learned. Even stranger, the dead woman's sister Valerie (Ann Dusenberry) agrees. Bone is not so sure, but he's in deeper than he realizes already. John Heard's performance is too 1970s ""methody"" for my taste. I find it over-the-top. Valerie disappears from the action without explanation. ""Cutter's Way"" is not a perfect film, but if you enjoy the pessimistic noir of the 1970s, before noir became a big studio staple again in the 1980s, you'll probably enjoy this.

The DVD (MGM 2001): The print of the film is fine, but the volume is too low. The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer (3 min) that has distorted sound. Subtitles and dubbing for the film are available in French and Spanish.",1310515200,,2496,4.617117117117117
1425575,5,B00005IA7Z,"Post Watergate and Vietnam this noir thriller was the last of its kind rich in the counter-culture's eccentricity to the have-nots who lost out. This is The Sun Also Rises of the Lost Generation of the 70s,high on drugs,booze and paranoid blues. Cutter's Way, a subversive masterpiece,is emotionally dense and intellectually incoherent. After Bone(Jeff Bridges),a Santa Barbara gigolo,spots a man stuffing a girl's body into a trash can one stormy night,he and his friend,Cutter(John Heard),set out to expose the culprit,tentatively identified as a fat cat oil tycoon, JJ Cord. Stern retribution against the powers that never pay for their mistakes is demanded by Cutter,a horribly mutilated Vietnam veteran who hounds the tycoon to his doom,guilty or not. In his quixotic quest for justice,Cutter is gradually transformed,one legged and all,into an Ahab pursuing his Moby Dick. For this little triangle of characters,including the mysterious Mo, Cutter's alcoholic wife(Einhorn),these are the Last Days of their way of life. There is a sense of ending in every frame of C.W.The American New Wave had passed with their dirty cocktail of social protest,youth culture empowerment and energy and political agitation. The three minnows threshing desperately to avoid being engulfed,caught in a nightmarish personal triangle of extraordinary,constantly shifting complexity,rippling with secrecies and ambivalent emotions that are hard to define.

Made by migr Czech director,Ivan Passer,a man who knew about fighting against overwhelming dark forces(cf. Prague Spring).He uses all the modes of cinematic storytelling,light and shadow,the grungily specific Americana,the palpable aura of rueful helplessness,the clever use of late sunlight,the use of characters who don't represent us,but are fiercely themselves,with their primal need to do the right thing. We mourn what America might have been,the tanks of Reaganism now on the lawn. Marvellous music by Jack Nitzche,amazing performances by Heard,Bridges and Eichhorn in one of the key films of the decade. Now re-released,let it garner all the praise it never got on 1st release,buried by the era of Lucasian and Speilbergian block-busters and new infantilism.",1308787200,2,2208,5.7317073170731705
1425576,4,B00005IA7Z,"In a recent review of ""Crazy Hearts"", the vehicle for Jeff Bridges' Oscar-winning performance as down and out country singer/songwriter Bad Blake, I noted that, in a sense, he had been preparing for and playing up to, in one form or another, that role since the start of his career. The line from Duane in ""The Last Picture Show"" to Bad in ""Crazy"", although not a straight, one-dimensional line, has exhibited some familiar mannerism and acting tics. Like, for example, that sense that you come away with after watching Bridges, or rather his characters, that he is always ready to walk away from a bad situation at the drop of a hat. And not look back, and with no regrets. Except, of course, when duty calls for him to ""take it on the chin"" for the good guys. ""Cutter's Way"", a film toward the beginning of Bridges long career is an exemplar of just that idea.

In the aftermath of Bridges' Oscar a number of art theaters are putting together and presenting a retrospective of his work.  A local theater in the Boston area is one such venue. ""Cutter's Way, while no means his best work, is worthy of inclusion in such efforts. Here Bridges plays beach bum, hanging-around guy, semi gigolo, Richard Bone, who seeming cannot be moved off a dead pan, dead-center of existence. Except he has this quirky friend, Cutter, a dysfunctional, psychically and physically wounded Vietnam vet looking for a quick hit at success. The plot line here provides amble opportunity for that after Bone is tangentially involved in a murder case. Needless to say old Cutter means to, come hell or high water, get a pay off from a rich guy who seems to have done the deed. And it goes from there.

Now here is the odd part.  Bridges puts in an adequate performance as the blas roustabout Bone and displays those mannerisms mentioned above that are his trademark. However, old gravelly-voiced, gritty-etched, eye-patched John Heard steals the whole show with his bravado performance. Although Cutter is, in the end, unsuccessful, trying to save his marriage to his long-suffering wife and does not win the prize that he so frantically seeks at that same end able to get Bone off dead-center. Kudos, Cutter/John Heard.",1274054400,3,2195,4.768421052631579
1425577,4,B00005IA7Z,"Cutter's Way takes it's time in developing and establishing a plot, so much so that I only made it all the way through the movie on my 3rd attempt.  Those who appreciate 'noir' will give this movie the highest ratings.  Personally I find a lot of 'noir' cinema to be something of a cop-out - movie endings that stop in mid-sentence - yes, there's a poetry and a power in that, although I'm more of a sucker for clever twists and surprise endings.  This is a decent movie and a good character study with some haunting images, and themes - taking a stand, making a commitment and heroism amidst futility - are some of the issues that emerge.  However, it's not an extremely high-paced ride.  It takes it's time and meanders quite a bit in the beginning, garners more interest mid-way through, and then ends quite suddenly in traditional noir style.  It's worth a look, but don't put it on when you're already tired.",1245628800,,913,4.536585365853658
1425588,5,B00005IA7Z,"""Cutter's Way,"" Ivan Passer's moody and eccentric 1981 drama, is the kind of film that requires repeated viewings. It's such a sad work, with unforgettable characters lost in a dreamy depression of white California sunshine. It's become a cult film, and perhaps its reputation precedes it.

It was because of that very reputation that I first viewed the film as a youth and wondered what all the fuss was about. Now as an adult, I have seen it again and suddenly understand it's dark agony. ""Cutter's Way"" is not an easy film to like, limping along much like its title character, enraged and filled with the bitterness of unfortunate fate.

John Heard's performance is the key. There was a time, around the late 1970s, when he was one of America's greatest actors. Heard made a trio of films, now largely forgotten, in which he perfectly symbolized the disaffected 20-something American suffering from a 1960's hangover. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Between-the-Lines-1985/dp/B000B8GA82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Between the Lines (1985)</a>&nbsp;(1977),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head-Over-Heels-aka-Chilly-Scenes-of-Winter/dp/6301966236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head Over Heels (aka Chilly Scenes of Winter)</a>&nbsp;(1979)  and ""Cutter's Way,"" he was adorned in frayed jeans, scruffy hair and the perennial slouch of the cynic, railing against society and wondering just how he failed to realize the moment America went to hell. As Alex Cutter in ""Cutter's Way,"" Heard gives a tour de force. A Vietnam veteran, hobbling around with one leg, one arm and an eye patch, Cutter is a perpetual drunk, slinging insults to anyone within earshot. He is enraged at a world that has forgotten him.

His best friend is Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges), a part-time beach bum, gigolo and boat salesman floating through a life of forgotten youth. They lounge in semi-commune in a rundown house with Cutter's wife Maureen (Lisa Eichhorn), the trio lost in depression and bottles of vodka. There was a time when life had meaning for these three, but that was many years ago.

Bone is driving home from a dalliance with an older married woman when his car breaks down in an alley. He witnesses a man dumping something into a trashcan, who then drives past him recklessly. Bone finds the police at his door the next morning. What was in the trashcan was a dead teenage hooker, and he's a suspect. At a parade the next day, he sees a man on a white horse and realizes this was the person he witnessed in the alley. There's one problem - he's the wealthiest and most powerful man in Santa Barbara.

Thus begins an unlikely mystery as Cutter wishes to fight for justice and see the man pay for his heinous crime. Bone, of course, could care less. For Cutter, it's an opportunity to convince his friend their miserable lives have purpose. Society, America, injustice - everything they once fought and rebelled against during the 1960s - has suddenly landed on their doorstep in the form of ""The Man.""

One of the many beauties of ""Cutter's Way"" is that you're never entirely sure if ""The Man"" is guilty or Cutter has just latched on to a fantasy to redeem a pathetic life. He alienates all around him and this specific project, blackmailing the suspect in an effort to prove he's guilty, could get them all killed. In the difficult and at times passive role of Bone, Jeff Bridges gives another in a long line of terrific performances. Forced to participate in Cutter's wild plan, he must come to terms with not only his love for Cutter, but his own loss of self worth. During their youth, hinted at throughout the film, there was the promise of making a difference while battling the Vietnam War, society and even Nixon. Such clear-cut enemies have long since faded. Much like the boats he attempts to sell, Bone is now adrift and average. Cutter's quest is an attempt to make a final stand against what he perceives to be corruption.

The final scene amazingly has Cutter riding on a white horse through ""The Man's"" property, past swimming pools, martini glasses and the socializing elite, symbolic of the 1960's rebellion against a corrupt America. In Cutter's mind, this wealth created the Vietnam War and sent many teenagers oversea to fight their battle, akin to throwing their lives into a trashcan. Cutter, carrying the deep scars of war, is taking on ""The Man,"" and Bone must decide whether or not to make a stand with him. When the film fades to black, Cutter and Bone have become one, bonding for life as friends, performing the final, haunting act of the 1960's generation.

It's a tragic ending, mournful and heartbreaking, and yet filled with love. ""Cutter's Way"" was barely released due to its unconventional nature, awkward, irate and disillusioned. But it has the depth of tragic poetry. After my second viewing, many years down the road, I suddenly understood the anguish of these characters, and it left me longing. If you get ""Cutter's Way,"" it could be one of the best films you've ever seen.",1236384000,7,5090,5.108173076923077
1425589,4,B00005IA7Z,"Remember Vietnam anyone?

Yes, it was a long time ago, but John Heard's character Alex Cutter is a victim of that horrific war that exposed US foreign policy as one that believed it could control political developments in Southeast Asia -- and the world for that matter-- under the now completely discredited Domino Theory as the wise men who couseled LBJ (""Hey, Hey LBJ- how many kids did you kill today?"")and gave LBJ false counsel to Lyndon Baines Johnson, who except for the monstrous blunder that ""his"" foreign policy was ""their foreign policy"".

Except for his Vietnam blunder would be rated as one of the best Presidents in US History: the Great Society, passage of landmark civil rights legislation under LBJ etc. Contrast LBJ with the puny ""w"" for example of a strong itelligent President who had to serve under the glossy veneer of John F. Kennedy who didn't amount to ""squat"" compared to LBJ.

Johnson had no background in foreign policy so he had to -- or believed he had to -- rely on this group of old cold war warriors. Most of them left over from the Kennedy era -- the best and the brightest as the late David Halberstam (""Making of a Quagmire"" was his famous book from that conflict) called them: Robert McNamara, Dean rusk , the McBundy brothers, Clark clifford, an ancient Washington fixer ""extrodinaire""lawyer and some others but their common denominator was their rigid belief that Communism was a monolithic theory and did not have any nationalist variations e.g. the communism of ""Red"" China ( that is how arrogant these old men were, they insisted on calling the new China ""Red"" China as if that tiny enclave on the island of Formosa was the real China.

But Alex Cutter, the character that John Heard plays -- in role that should have at least received Heard a nomination for Best Actor for that year -- represents all of the young men who were wounded physically and menally from that bogus conflct that cost the US 57,000 dead. And many more left with life altering wounds that would never heal, sacrificed on the altar of Anti-Communism and of course the real victims of the US war ""On"" Vietnam not ""In"" vietnam because that's what it was: total war using Napalm, Agent Orange and many more chemicals that the tiny country of Vietnam served as the experimental ""trial country"" for the use of the newest weapons in the arsenal of the military, the courageous people of Vietnam who lost many millions and their beautiful country despoiled by the US chemical warfare using Agent Orange and many more defoliants, and chemicals all with unknown side effects and longevity in the environment.

These old men who were fixated on the past --""containment was their mantra"" -- and could not see the political evolution of nationalism taking place in that tiny country in southeast Asia. The French had abondoned Vietnam -- the last of their colonial possessions in their ""sphere of influence"" -- as their total defeat at ""Dienbenfu"" by Ho Chi Mien and his nationlist followers who represented the new breed of Communism: nationalist communism that didn't take its signal form Moscow or Peking as the Chineese capital was known then (Bejing now) and handed off that area of the globe to Uncle Sap whose foreign policy -- if it could be called that -- was under the control of the Domino Theory ""real politic"" tough guys.

Anyhow, that is the background or setting of this vastly underrated classic ""film noir"" with superb performances all around under the great direction of Ivan Passer. Alex Cutter played by John Heard is contrasted to the laid back character of Richard Bone as played by Jeff Bridges in his usual competent style, who for my money is one of the best Actors in Hollywood. The movie is set in the exclusive community of Santa Barbara, California where the rich and super rich live and control this lovely city on the western edge of California.

A young women is mysteriously killed in the opening sequence of the film and that becomes the basis of this conspiracy classic as Alex obsesses with the identity of the young women's killer. Also a wonderful performance from Lisa Eichorn who never really made it in Hollywood despite her obvious talent. Well, I don't want to spoil it for you but either buy this classic or rent it -- if it can be found -- amidst the junk of Blockbuster or Hollywood rental companies.

Also, a superb musical soundtrack with haunting music that is perfectly matched to this fine movie that had to be retitled: it was originally
""Cutter and Bone"" but the title proved to be too strong and the new title: ""Cutter's Way"" was chosen. But regardless of the title this in one of the best classic film noirs ever made.

1425591,5,B00005IA7Z,"Brilliant allegorical film about wealth, power, and commitment  in America. Judging from other reviews, the film does not appeal to everyone. That's understandable. The characters are almost uniformly dislikable, from the abusive Rich (John Heard), to the egotistical Alex (Jeff Bridges), to the self-pitying Mo (Lisa Eichorn), to the slimy George (Arthur Rosenburg)-- there is no one left to root for. At least not until later when the two crippled halves of Bridges and Heard finally unite, figuratively and literally, into one potent whole. Then we realize that it's toward this completion that the twists and turns of the movie have been moving all along. (I think this also explains why the Ann Dusenberry character drops out at a critical stage. She is no longer needed to get the two together.)

Rarely has any film dared to create such an unsympathetic cast of personalities, especially Heard's Richard Cutter. If he has a single redeeming quality, I can't find it. His loud, grating voice annoys, piling on one sarcasm after another, oblivious to the hurt he causes. Like Mo he wallows in self-pity, and even shamelessly exploits his disability. Then too, his pursuit of the god-like J. J. Cord should appear noble, yet seems more the result of paranoid rage than a  desire for justice. In fact, Heard's explosion of anger on the Santa Monica pier is among the scariest, most convincing expressions of pent-up emotion that I've seen in many years of movie watching. Perhaps he can be charitably viewed as an avenging angel, in the manner of Lee Marvin in Point Blank. But that's a a stretch, since the Vietnam War has left him literally half-a-man, a berserk little top spinning around on alcohol and apoplexy, which, of course, is why he needs the able-bodied Alex to carry out his obsession.

Yet Bridge's Alex Bone is an ultimate floater, getting by on boyish good-looks and charm. He has no concerns beyond himself, even seducing the vulnerable Mo, while husband Cutter is away. Apathy is his natural state. So trying to get him to act on the murder he's witnessed is like trying to push a big rock uphill. In fact, when he finally does blend with Cutter's rage and act, it's only because of Cord's arrogant 'sunglasses' gesture, and not because of a sudden steadfast commitment. In most films, it would be the handsome Bone riding the white charger and storming the heavens, having undergone a last minute conversion, and finally giving the audience someone to root for. Here, however, it's the wild spirit of Cutter who rides to the rescue, having at last gotten his legs back if only for a moment. Thus, contrary to expectations, the only concession to Bone is a compromised last minute one.

There is, of course, a political subtext to all of this as one perceptive reviewer points out. Perhaps it's about how criminal wealth and power exist beyond the reach of ordinary folks, and how a commitment for change gets dispersed by escapism and a popular feeling of powerlessness, which can only be corrected by what appears a radical form of madness. But allegories aside, this is a bitter brew that does not go down easily. More than that, however, it remains a superb cult film whose provocative characters and perplexing imagery stay with you long after the screen has gone to black.",1147651200,25,3300,4.875222816399287
1425592,4,B00005IA7Z,"The title ""Cutter's Way"" is a reference to the main character, Alexander Cutter, perhaps cinema's all-time best antihero. John Heard plays the difficult role of an angry Vietnam veteran who returned from what he now regards as a meaningless war minus an arm, an eye, and a leg. He hates the fat cats-feeling that they conned him and others into patriotically serving while they stayed home, and he resents his best friend Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges) who avoided the war and continues to avoid any involvement or commitment. Commitment is Alexander Cutter's one remaining virtue, when he sets his sights on taking down an arrogant oil tycoon who has gotten away with murdering a 17 year old cheerleader, he stubbornly refuses to give up this mission and insists on doing it his way..

Heard should have gotten the Best Actor Oscar in 1981 (it went to Henry Fonda for ""On Golden Pond"") but ""Cutter's Way"" was not popular with critics and viewers so Heard was not even nominated for this role. It is an amazing performance as Heard must win audience sympathy for a character who is not only unpleasant, but terribly abusive to everyone, including his wife and his only two remaining friends. But he earns our admiration with his final act as a knight (on a white horse) who gallops into danger to avenge his wife's murder.

With this Cutter is finally revealed as a romantic who is willing to back up his angry words and seemingly empty threats. His anger is over more than his futile wartime sacrifice. He feels frustration and confusion because while he has remained the same, the world has changed around him in ways antithetical to his beliefs (can you identify with that?). He recognizes that he has become irrelevant to this world but is not going out until he has made a last stand. His commitment ultimately gets Bone to take his first moral stand and finish what his friend started, doing it ""Cutter's Way"".

Like ""Fat City"" (another of Jeff Bridges' early films) ""Cutter's Way"" is more appreciated now than at the time of its release. In part this is because both of these films have held up very well, if anything their political messages are even more relevant today. And make no mistake, thematically ""Cutter's Way"" is a political film-both anti-war and anti-power; very much in the tradition of ""Chinatown"" and the world of Raymond Chandler adaptations.

This film is essentially a character study with an expressionistic ending. Most action/adventure fans will find it way too slow and cerebral for their tastes. The acting and the themes are its strength, the contrived story is a non-fatal flaw. The multi-dimensionality of Cutter, Bone, and Cutter's wife Mo (an extraordinary performance by Lisa Eichhorn) are carefully crafted and revealed by director Ivan Passer. Cutter's other remaining friend George (Arthur Rosenberg) is equally well crafted but more secondary to the story.

A fifth character (the dead cheerleader's older sister played by Ann Dusenberry) appears to be a victim of the post-production process as she simply disappears without explanation about 20 minutes before the film's end. Normally the absence of a supporting character would go unnoticed but Dusenberry had done such a nice job developing this character (maximizing what little she was given to work with) that the absence is glaring. Contemporary audiences will see a lot of Dominique Swain in Dusenberry. They not only look enough alike to be sisters but they have the same confident flare to their acting style. Passer had to work hard to keep Dusenberry reined in but succeeded in getting a nice restrained performance from her, her high intensity peaks through just enough to convey that there is more to her character than meets the eye.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1130976000,14,3785,4.924764890282131
1425593,2,B00005IA7Z,"I recall seeing this movie in a theater way back in 1981, when it was first released, and thinking (at the time) that it was very entertaining. In a fit of nostalgia, I recently rented the DVD and discovered that my initial, youthful impression was way off base. Like Shelly Winters and fish, this movie did not age well.

I have always been a great fan of Jeff Bridges (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot was a classic) and would have sworn that he never appeared in a bad movie....until I (re)saw this one. Bridges plays a gigolo/boat salesman who never works or commits to anything, which becomes quite tiresome as the movie progresses. His life is a sham and he constantly seeks the easy way out. I can accept this, but would have preferred some growth, some improvement in his character as the movie progresses. None is forthcoming. Worst of all, he lacks the sly, roguish charm we always expect from old Jeff...he is simply a boring, loutish, manipulative loser.

John Heard, appearing rather young and slim (compared to his current corpulence) is annoying, loud, and obnoxious as the title character, Cutter: a badly injured Viet Nam vet who uses his disabilities as an excuse whenever his foul, drunken mouth gets him in trouble (which is often). Shouting and cursing is simply not acting...if it were, we could all be stars, and in this case, while I believe we are meant to find Cutter to be a troubled but amusing character, he is simply a repugnant jerk. It has been suggested that Heard deserved an academy award for his performance, but was not even nominated (big surprise), perhaps for ""political"" reasons. I contend that he was not nominated because his grating, annoying performance never rose above the level of school yard tantrum. It was awful. I would gladly submit to root canal surgery rather than endure another minute of his ranting dialog and gross, obnoxious over-acting.

The only good characterization is by Lisa Eichorn, as Heard/Cutter's long suffering, alcoholic (who could blame her?) wife, who seems strangely amused and tolerant of his boisterous, annoying behavior. Perhaps she knows a side of him that is simply not presented in the movie. She presents a vulnerable, touching performance....the only redeeming virtue in this otherwise unremarkable movie.

The plot is extremely slow moving, centering around the brief and indistinct witnessing by Bridges' character of the disposal of a murder victim. The very next day (what a coincidence !!!), while attending a parade, he believes that he sees the murderer, who happens to be a rich and powerful man. Rather than go to the police with their hunch, Cutter hatches a hair-brained plot to blackmail the rich guy....if he pays, then he must be guilty. He also enlists the help of the murder victim's sister, who seems totally unemotional, considering that her sister was brutally murdered two days before, and acts like she is along on a field trip to the zoo....which is no real problem, since she simply disappears from the cast long before the conclusion.

The characters spend what seems like hours arguing, shouting, shoving, and degrading each other while they try to hatch their flimsy plot. Several times, my finger was poised over the ""STOP"" button on my DVD control, itching to put an end to this increasingly annoying shout-fest. I stuck it out to the climax, which is so unlikely, so utterly preposterous that it leaves you shaking your head in disbelief. I, like many of the other reviewers, may have been blinded by nostalgia, but the harsh reality is that this is simply not a good movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this turkey....other than watching Lisa Eichorn, it really isn't worth the time or effort.",1122422400,4,3701,4.905750798722044

Imagine my dissapointment. The picture and sound quality were dire. Too much contrast in the video and the sound had to be turned up super loud to follow the dialogue.

The movie came across as just another viet vet/counter culture exploitation movie with a trite plot that hardly went anywhere and never engaged me or made me feel any suspense. Dialogue was dated and cliched.

1425595,3,B00005IA7Z,"I read some great reviews that got me interested and excited about this film, but it just never happened. I had trouble following the story and the characters.  I will admit, Heard's Cutter was outstanding.  I was surprised that he was not up for an award for his role in this film, but Bridges just seemed to lack on every level.  Unless he is handed an exceptional script, Bridges plays the same sort of character over and over again.  I also had trouble with the female character of Mo in this film. It was never really understood what her relationship was to everyone until I read some reviews, which then made sense.

I also had trouble with Cutter's physical condition.  It seemed like he was fully able to do everything, except sleep with his wife, as a normal person would. I guess that was the point.  Create a character that is so believable that you don't see the physical condition. Too bad I did.  I really wanted him to lift up his eye-patch to reveal to us that perhaps he was none other than One-Eyed Willy himself.  That would have been a perfect twist.

There were gaping holes in this film as well.  The plot seemed to jump around without any explanation. I needed more story on who the friend was and his connection to J.J. Cord.  The girl that follows Bone and Cutter around seems to have disappeared midway through the film and it was her battle they were fighting. The only redeeming aspect of this film was the ending.  My decent review of this film was dependent on the ending and it succeeded.  The ending leaves all of it up to the viewer.  The imagination can play wonders with this and I think it can be interpreted in anyway. I especially loved reading about the Hamlet reference that I didn't see it until now, but it makes perfect sense. That is why I watch these films. I want to see how other people see life and their representation on camera.

Overall, Cutter's Way was not a great film, but the ending redeemed itself in someway that I will never be able to explain.

1425596,4,B00005IA7Z,"When Cutter's Way was first released in theatres in 1981, it tanked at the box office thanks to bad press from The New York Times and a nervous studio still smarting from the bath it took on Heaven's Gate. A good film almost disappeared from sight. Fortunately, the advent of video, and now its debut on DVD, has given this unusual film a second chance that it so richly deserves.
Jeff Bridges proves once again that he is one of the best American actors working in film today. He portrays Bone as a man afraid of commitment, content to do little, but fall back on his pretty boy looks to bed any woman who crosses his path. As one character tells him, ""Sooner or later you're going to have to make a decision about something."" This could be the underlying thesis of the whole film: making decisions, taking a stand about something.
John Heard's Alex Cutter is on the opposite end of the spectrum. He desperately wants to get involved in something, anything to stop living life in a bottle of alcohol. And so, he latches on to the murder mystery with the ferocious tenacity of a pitbull. Heard plays Cutter like a character straight out of a Tom Waits song. His performance, complete with raspy voice and cynical outlook on life, recalls many of Waits' down-on-their-luck losers that populate his songs.
The actors vividly breathe life into their respective characters creating the impression that they exist beyond what we see on the screen, that in some way we already know them and that they'll continue to exist after the film ends.
Director Ivan Passer also deserves credit for creating this world. From the haunting opening shot of a parade, caught in dreamy slow motion (thanks to Jordan Cronenweth's superb cinematography), filmed at first in black and white and then as the credits fade in and out it gradually becomes colour, Passer draws the audience into his absorbing drama. Cutter's Way contains strong visuals to contrast the ambiguous story. Nothing is spelled out for the audience, even right up to its conclusion. Do we support Cutter's obsessive conspiracy theories or Bone's refusal to get involved?
Following in the grand tradition of short changing this movie, MGM has decided to include only the theatrical trailer on the DVD. What about a retrospective featurette? All the principals are still alive and I'm sure would love to talk about this movie. Or an audio commentary? Jeff Bridges contributed an excellent one on the Against All Odds DVD so he's hip to the format. A lot of missed opportunities here.",1056067200,42,2530,4.805045871559633
1425597,4,B00005IA7Z,"I was interested in this film because may years ago I had read the book, ""Cutter and Bone"" on which it was based.  I remembered it took place in the post-Vietnam era and one of the characters was a hard-drinking, foul-mouthed, crippled Vietnam vet.  I had forgotten that the book had depressed me then.  But viewing this video brought it all back to me.  And I was depressed all over again.
The film is set in Santa Barbara and stars Jeff Bridges, as a drifter with an eye for women.  John Heard plays his best friend, the Vietnam vet, and Lisa Eichhorn plays the vet's alcoholic wife.  John Heard's makeup is great as it really looks like he has only one leg, one arm and one eye. He's a sorrowful sight but he's quite unlikable as he's an angry, scheming character with a sense of high drama.  Some of his dialog is brilliant and opens a lot of cans of worms about what happened in Vietnam.
When Jeff Bridges stumbles upon a murder by an ""upright citizen"", John Heard convinces his friend to blackmail the murderer with the help of the victim's sister, played by Ann Dusenberry.  What follows is a sometimes funny and rather poignant psychological thriller, with an underlying sense of tragedy. It's fast paced, well acted and deals with an interesting theme.  I should have loved it.  Right?
Wrong!  I just didn't like it.  It wasn't because the film wasn't good.  I just didn't like the sense of anger and hopelessness throughout.  And I didn't like any of the characters.

7938134,5,B00005IA7Z,"Most people remember John Heard, who died recently, as either the father from the Home Alone movies or the character actor who, later in his life, specialized in playing weak or corrupt authority figures. But, given the right vehicle, Heard could be a force as an actor, as he was in his best film, Cutters Way. Sadly, the studio butchered the marketing of the 1981 movie, and Heard never got the acclaim he deserved, but the film has since developed a well-deserved reputation as a cult masterpiece.

Cutters Way, based on Newton Thornburgs excellent novel, Cutter and Bone, is the story of two losers who stumble onto a mystery of sorts that threatens to engulf them. Cutter (Heard) is a one-eye, one-armed, one-legged, badly disfigured, self-destructive alcoholic Vietnam vet who is understandably bitter about his life and lashes out verbally at the slightest provocation, displaying a razor-sharp wit and no self control. His best friend is Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges), an easy going, burned-out dropout from society who gets by as a part-time gigolo, bedding and hustling well-to-do older women. Their life changes when Bone witnesses a wealthy industrialist, J.J. Cord, dumping the body of a teenage girl in a dumpster one night. Bone is understandably reluctant to get involved, but Cutter wants to pursue the matter, either to bring Cord to justice or to shake him down.

Director Ivan Passer never makes it clear what Cutters real motivation is, and thats one of the films strengths.  Cutters Way isn't a movie about either underdogs out for justice or small-time crooks trying to hit it big. Instead, its a downbeat character study of three victims of the post-Vietnam, post-hippy climate in California in the late 1970s. The third piece of the triangle is Cutters wife Mo (Lisa Eichhorn), also an alcoholic, who stays with him for lack of anyplace better to go. The three lead actors are at their best here, playing losers who still manage to engender audience sympathy even as they are getting sucked ever deeper into what seems like a hopeless crusade.

Although, as you might guess, Cutters Way is often a depressing, downbeat movie, it has a lot of humor in it as well. Heard unleashes a lot of bitter yet bitingly funny retorts and observations in the movie, and he and Bridges have a good chemistry here. Those used to the more recent showy Bridges roles in films like ""True Grit"" will be surprised by his laid back demeanor here. Still, his body language reflects the pain that he registers at each bad turn in the movie.

Cutters Way was made in 1981, but its very much a product of 1970s film making, an era in which honest portrayals of life on the edges were preferred to feel-good artificiality. Those looking for a pleasant two hours with a Big Lebowski styled Jeff Bridges should check out that film instead. Cutters Way is downbeat but emotionally honest, and a terrific character study of three people who all too rarely find themselves the centerpieces of any movies nowadays.",1502582400,,3005,4.87279843444227
7938135,5,B00005IA7Z,"I remember hearing about the movie CUTTERS WAY when it was released back in 1981. I never had the opportunity to see it at the time because it left as soon as it came, a critically acclaimed film that never found an audience. I finally got the chance to see it years later on cable and loved it. I found it hard to believe that it never did well at the box office but the way it was released had more to do with that than anything. Great movies given little push or promotion that are not allowed time for audiences to discover them are multitude in number. Thank goodness home video and then discs have allowed that to change and these movies given a chance to be found.

The movie tells the story of two friends. Alex Cutter (John Heard) is a war torn Vietnam vet who lost an eye, a leg and an arm while there. Bitter and alcoholic he lives with his wife Mo (Lisa Eichhorn), another alcoholic loved by both Cutter and Bone, complaining and abusing her mentally. He is not the most sympathetic character you will find on film but as we come to know him there is something there.

Cutters friend is Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges), a small time gigolo whos not the brightest crayon in the box. One night Bones car breaks down during a rain storm and he is forced to leave it behind. Before leaving to get help he sees a large car pull into the alleyway hes stuck in, someone get out of the car and dump a large object nearby and then leave. The next day when he reads that the body of a young woman was found brutally murdered in the alley he becomes a suspect.

While at a parade with Cutter, the two watch until Bone thinks he recognizes the man who dumped the body in the alley. The man is local tycoon J.J. Cord and the odds of him being arrested let alone convicted are slim. Bone lets it go but Cutter has other plans. Still raw from the treatment he received in war at the hands of those in high positions, Cutter begins looking for clues that will bring the guilty man to justice. In so doing he will put himself, his family and his friend in greater danger.

The story may sound simple and in some ways it is. Instead it is the character study of those involved that makes this a great film. It becomes a whodunit wrapped around the characters in the film, in particular Cutter. It elevates it from what could have been a pulp novel into something much more than that.

A large part of the success of the film lies in the performance of John Heard. Prior to this Heard hadnt found any huge roles to raise him from secondary status. Following this he began to do so with the high profile CAT PEOPLE. Still, he never quite made it to the top when it came to roles which is sad. On display here in this film he showed that he wasn't a pretty face or a typical leading man but a solid actor whose abilities were rarely tapped. Cutter comes to life in the performance Heard gives here and thats an amazing ability.

The rest of the cast is equally impressive. Bridges has always been an overlooked actor who deserves more recognition as well, but at least he achieved mega-star status. Perhaps this is due to a better agent or the fact that Bridges was in more populist films. Eichhorn as the beleaguered wife who still loves her husband is great. She brings a sympathy to the character in her suffering and affection.

The history of the film is that it was lost in the shuffle of new executives at the studio and dumped when released. A few bad notices the first week meant that the release was provided with little advertising and left to come and go. That changed week two when several rave reviews arrived and it was given over to their classics division. Even that didn't save the film from leaving screens at the time. At least it can be rediscovered now.

Twilight Time has again given us the opportunity to watch the film in the cleanest and clearest picture possible. Extras are limited to an isolated score track, audio commentary with film historians Julie Kirgo and Nick Redman and the original theatrical trailer. As with all their titles the quantity of this one is limited so do yourself a favor and make sure you pick one up before they're all gone.",1501200000,2,4166,4.352638352638353

Anyone familiar with Santa Barbara and Montecito will appreciate the setting. The plot elements (wounded Vietnam vet, alcoholic wife, arrogant oil tycoon) could have been clich or melodramatic if less skillfully handled, but the script , direction, and acting come together to leave a lasting impression of a flawed character's stand against evil and injustice.",1500681600,4,521,5.289156626506024
7938137,2,B00005IA7Z,"As usual, Bridges & Heard make quality acting look easy. But holy fudge, what an incredibly muddled mess this thing is. It's a film compromised almost entirely of a drawn-out middle. There is little linking the nebulous relationship of the main characters, other than that Bone is a playboy, Cutter's a cripple (in more ways than one), Mo's a casualty by acquaintance, and Valerie breezes through a blackmail plot involving one of society's pillars, so disengaged you would think she's planning a surprise birthday party instead of avenging her murdered sister. Why do they hover constantly over this love triangle? At what point do we ever get to see the glimmers of light in the broken shards of Cutter's persona that keeps his beleaguered wife around? What transcendent bond does this blue-collar Vietnam vet share with this entitled pretty boy who spent the war ensconced in the free love of the anti-war movement? None of this seems important to this screen adaption, content in itself that these people are just somehow lumped in this existence together, velcroed together as it were.
In watching this you see what a casualty of editing this is; it's the underappreciated 1/3rd of the filmmaking process (writing, directing, editing). Many little shots give it away. It feels more like a late-stage workprint than a finely whittled product deserving of it's budget & talent.
Going in I had high hopes for this one, anticipating a hidden gem finally getting its due with a snappy looking Blu-Ray release, but instead I can't help but feel let down, and in no small way. Post-Vietnam disenfranchisement, vengeance, corruption stretching to the highest-levels, protagonists with conflicting rewards/values, and a troubled anti-hero are all makings for interesting story-telling but instead what we get is a group of people who just sort shrug their way through it all.",1491091200,,1871,5.117647058823529
