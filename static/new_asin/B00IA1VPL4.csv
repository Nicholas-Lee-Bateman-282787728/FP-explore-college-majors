8640284,4,B00IA1VPL4,"This titke of the film may sound like a joke but the film is very serious because of the stakes it brings up.

The first one is Gondrys idea expressed from the very start that film and video are manipulative.

Film and video are both, by their nature, manipulative. The editor or director proposes an assembly of carefully selected segments that he/she has in mind. In other words, the context becomes more important than the content, and, as a result, the voice that appears to come from the subject is actually coming from the filmmaker. That is why I find the process manipulative. The human brain forgets the cuts -- a faculty specifically human that, I will learn, Noam calls ""psychic continuity."" The brain absorbs a constructed continuity as a reality and, consequently, gets convinced to witness a fair representation of the subject. On the other hand, animation that I decided to use for this film is clearly the interpretation of its author. If messages, or even propaganda, can be delivered, the audience is constantly reminded that they are not watching reality, so it's up to them to decide if they are convinced or not.

The animation is absolutely mesmerizing, which is a compliment, hypnotizing, and you just don't hear what is being said at all. At the same time if you are concentrating on what is being said, which is always difficult because man is a visual dominant being, you do not see the animation any more. Film or video  and I believe the two are not the same at all (I can absolutely overlook subtitles on a video screen whereas it is practically impossible for me to do the same on a cinema screen) at least if I follow Marshall McLuhan  are by definition visual first and thus by definition manipulative. If the images are not plainly supporting the discourse, the discourse is not understood. Many experiments have been done on the subject, among others as reported by Marshall McLuhan. Thus the best film or video setting for an interview is just the plain image of the interviewee and the interviewer.

This film is thus highly manipulative and you need to watch it at least twice if you want to both appreciate the animation and the interview. Or you can cheat like me and use the movie script available at http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=is-the-man-who-is-tall-happy. Gondry is wrong about animation not disturbing the meaning of the interview. First as I have said it interferes with the reception of the interview. But second it does perverts the interview because the brain does not work the same way for a visual message that has to be analyzed in patterns that have no semantic meaning per se (there is no dictionary of animated patterns) but can only find a meaning in the way these visual patterns are analyzed by the brain and the mind bringing into the interpretation of the received images all that it, the brain, or rather they, the brain and the mind, has or have accumulated in years of life and experience. At the same time Gondry recognizes several times he did not understand Chomskys meaning and yet he illustrated the concerned passages. Is that the illustration of Chomskys meaning or of Gondrys misunderstanding?

Apart from this general remark, I am now going to concentrate on some of the things Chomsky said.

Personally I am not interested in his memories about his life. I am only interested in his approach of linguistics and language and there is a lot of that in the interview. The fact that his oldest recollection is dated of when he was 16 months old, the fact that he went to a Dewey progressive school up to the year he moved to a standard public high school, the fact that he spent his Saturday afternoon in the museums of Philadelphia, and many other facts of the type are for me uninteresting. What he says about his family, both ascending and descending, his grand children and his children, and his wife is for me of little interest. What he says about the treatment of Jewish refugees during the war and after the war by the United States is interesting from an historical point of view but very little from a scientific linguistic point of view. His lapsus about Palestine when speaking of Israel is what it is, an old age lapsus that shows the re-emergence of what he said about his father: He was then a deeply committed zionist, but for him, it was a cultural revival, basically. That sounds a little bit short. So I will overlook these sections that more or less emphasize, positively or negatively, the age of the man.

First remark on Noam Chomskys inteview.

The more intensively the topic is studied... [ Camera rattling ] ...the more sophisticated the research techniques, the more we learn that children know quite a lot of language, much more than you would expect, before they can exhibit any of that knowledge.

What he says about children does not take into account the fact that the child is not a tabula rasa when he is born. He has heard since the 24th week of pregnancy what was being said around him inside his mother. He has heard everything around him from inside his mother accompanied by the emotional reactions of the mother expressed in what she may have said, the tones of her discourse, the rhythm of her heart and many other hormonal or simply physiological elements that varied along with her moods and that child associated these changes to what he heard, without knowing the meaning of the words and sentences because he could not see what they referred to. And that full experience of the mothers moods and actions started from the very first day and that embryo and then fetus registered all these elements, including after 24 weeks what he heard.

That shows in fact that Chomsky  probably because of his being a progressive mind  refuses to take into account these nine months of extremely intense experience because it would valorize the idea that from the very first day of conception the embryo and then fetus is building up its and then later his or her mental baggage. That would go against his probable conviction that abortion is a womans right. To avoid a contradiction it is better to overlook the fact. It has been proved the newborn as soon as he is born can react to the names of his brothers and sisters when they are uttered even in a sequence of words that are not separated by pauses and that for most of them have no connection with these names. We just do not know what the newborn has accumulated during his nine months of motherly transportation. It is only recently that some serious studies have been started here and there. Once again the question must have been taboo because the church of Scientology is making it a central principle of theirs that as soon as conception is effective the embryo and then later fetus is recording what is being said and the child will remember it in his subconscious mind all his life and that will determine or block his actions and feelings. Once again, rather than discussing that conception we prefer overlooking the question. Memory is attached to some proteins in the brain and the body and these proteins do not come from nowhere. They come from the spermatozoon and the egg that join at conception into a zygote. So we should try to find out if these memory proteins are already present or active even through some surrogate element in the zygote instead of just casting the first stone.

If you add these nine months of extreme contact with the mother to the twelve months necessary for the child to start uttering some syllables if not words, if you take into account the extreme trauma this birth is and the extreme intensity of the desire and instinct to survive, then you might understand why he learns the language or languages around him so easily, and I should use three pairs of quotes. Strangely enough he explains later that what seems complex (the syntactic structure of a sentence like The man who is tall is happy) is simple when captured as a structure and not as a continuous flow of phonemes.

And here again he misses a point, a point he should have known since his master Zellig Harris dedicated his whole work in linguistics on that very point. A child or anyone actually who hears the sentence I have just quoted not only hears a continuum of phonemes but also an intonation and small pauses in that intonation going up and down in a tonal way. He, after a certain length of experience, knows that the sequence man who is highly locked up because of the very low chances that this connection might be ruptured because of the high level of syntactic dependence between the two words, whereas the sequence tall is has very high chances to be cut up with another word because the connection between the two words is very low as for syntactic dependence. And Zellig Harris based his reasoning on phonetic probabilities of a sound to turn up after another, of /w/ to turn up after /n/ for example within the set of possible sounds after that sound /n/. And these statistical, frequency facts can be learned from mere experience based on our mirror neurons that make us imitate such elements like structures, intonations. Then from these experiential tonal and statistical elements the child learns and any speaker knows you cannot take the first is out because of it being enclosed in the block who is tall which in itself is syntactically dependent and is also syntactically dependent to the preceding block the man whereas on the other hand the relation of the second is is syntactically connected to the following happy but not to the preceding tall. Hence it is the one that can move. Whats more there is an intonation pattern and a pause between tall and is.

The argument that the first is being closer to the beginning of the sentence is easier to move to that beginning is in fact based on linear writing order and not on tonal oral uttering. If you take into account the tonal uttering of the sentence then there is only one spot that is loose and then the second is is obviously the one that can move. To prove it we would have to devise a testing procedure in which similar sentences would be tonally perverted so that the listener would be misguided into moving the wrong element. Such experiments have not been done and it is maybe a shame. I will satisfy myself with what Zellig Harris said and wrote on the subject and I will disregard what Chomsky just said in this video.

On the other hand Chomsky is a lot better inspired when he speaks of psychic continuity.

We identify dogs, for example, in terms of a property of psychic continuity. Like, if a witch turns a dog into a camel, and then some fairy princess kisses the camel and it turns back to a dog, it's been a dog all along, even when it looked like a camel. I mean, that's the basis of fairy tales . . . But psychic continuity is not a physical property. It's a property that we impose on things.

There I could not agree more. Thats how the mind works: The brain captures some sensory influx. It splits it up into patterns if the eye or the ear have not done so already and its scan a data base for one item that would be the same or similar, and thus it is recognized, or it is identified as a new item. Then and only then the item is connected to an identity, a symbolic element of any type that is stored in the mental memory of words for instance, of concepts, because memorized words no matter as little abstract they may be are conceptualized items, that is to say abstract models of what they are supposed to represent. It is this continuity in our mind, and the mind is the virtual construct produced by out brain and central nervous system confronted to the world it is trying to capture with the senses in order to survive in this world by working out a position for ourselves in this environment that could choke us to death if we let it do it. So it is not so much psychic or psychological but mental, though fundamentally it is correct: the item out there that I call a dog is an item that is captured by my senses and identified to the concept dog I have in my mind and my memory will keep in mind the various states of this item if it transforms itself under my eyes. I will always recognize a rosebush even if there is no rose on it. I say recognize and I mean mentally identify this plant in front of me as a rosebush because either it carries roses or because it has the leaves and the thorns I have stored in my conceptual mental data base as being typical of a rosebush (and it might only be the pricking of the thorns I have stored) and if a sorcerer turns this rosebush into a rutabaga, it will still be a rosebush disguised as a rutabaga. Mental continuity indeed! And if no one kisses it for it to turn back to a rosebush then it will become a rutabaga that used to be a rosebush. The continuity is temporal in that case but when I encounter a rosebush, any rosebush, I will identify it as a rosebush and that will be conceptual continuity. Then what he says after that is just unacceptable.

So, therefore, there is no hope for finding a way of identifying the things that are related to symbols by looking at their physical properties. They're individuated. They're identified in terms of our mental constructions, so they're basically mental objects. And that means the whole referentialist concept has to be thrown out... And you have to look at the relation of language to the world in some different fashion. So, and do you say we constructed the world in mirroring this image we had in our mind, then? We do it, but we don't do it the way philosophers and linguists think we do it. We certainly do it. So, for example, sure, we see the world in terms of trees and dogs and rivers and so on, but then the question is, ""well"", what are those concepts?"" Now, the standard assumption is those concepts are linked to physical -- identifiable, physical things in the extramental world, and that assumption is just false. And unless we rid ourselves of that assumption, we won't be able to understand the way thought and language relates to the world. But that's a topic that's just taboo in philosophy and psychology, so they're stuck. They're like mechanics, pre-Galileo, where everything went to its natural place.

He would be right if he said that in our mind and our consciousness we can only have mental objects that are constructed from the contact we entertain with the world. They are not the objects themselves but only models of them and we can be wrong and identify an otter as a ferret, which will not make that otter a ferret for sure and what is wrong with us is that either we do not have the constructed model of an otter in our mind and thus we cannot recognize it as such and our natural laziness will identify the otter as a ferret because in  our mental eye they are close, or the mental constructs we have of the otter and the ferret are not correct, or the otter we have in front of our eyes is not a standard otter and it is misshaped to the point of being close to the mental construct we have of a ferret.

The way Chomsky words the idea or the problem sounds as if for him the real world did not exist and he forgets the proof of the pudding is its being edible or being eaten, and the proof of a bus is the fact that it will run you down if you stand in front of it. I can always cry Butterfly! the bus will not be a butterfly except if in my own mind a butterfly is what everyone else calls a bus, and then I better step away from it. You can call the middle light of traffic lights amber, yellow or orange, the meaning is the same you better either stop or get ready to start according to the rules in various countries. Mao Zedongs Red Guards wanted to invert the meaning of red and green lights since red is positive and is the energy necessary to go down the revolutionary road. It did not happen but then the meaning of the top light would have been go and the meaning of the bottom light would have been stop, but that would not have changed the colors of the two lights. A color-blind person can drive because he identifies the lights as top, middle and bottom, and the meanings that go along with these characteristics which are side characteristics for non-color-blind people who would stop at any red light even upside down.

I will in that line say that what he calls the philosophical problem of the ship of Theseus is not really serious. If we start entering such questions we will never get anywhere. Why not start the medieval discussion that asks the following question: a farmer is holding a pig on a rope on their way to the market: who is leading whom, the farmer the pig or the pig the farmer? Such questions, such problems do not concern the real world. If you meet the clone of your father in the street, will that clone be your father? Apart from the ethical problem there, it is not in anyway a philosophical problem at all, nor a logical problem: he is the clone of your father  at least if you can identify him as such

His notions about the invention  which he does not call invention  of language by Homo Sapiens between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago is just misinformed.

When you think about it, as we started to do from the '50s -- there's an evolutionary basis for this, too. Language is a very curious phenomenon. I mean, one question we ought to be puzzled with -- well, two questions -- is, why are there any languages at all, and another one is, why are there so many? If you go back, say, questions were answered, because that's when our ancestors left Africa. And there's been no relevant cognitive change since, so children everywhere in the world have the same capacity for language acquisition. So, the questions were finished by about 50,000 years ago. And if you go back very shortly before that, maybe 100,000 years ago, the questions were answered 'cause there weren't any languages.

Homo Sapiens developed in Africa at least 250,000 years ago and the migrations within Africa started very early, and the one to the north down the Nile valley reached Crete around 160,000 years ago. He is there limited in his approach because of his genetic black box and/or Universal Grammar that blocks the real question: what is the phylogeny of language and how did Homo Sapiens invent it? Language was invented from scratch and the mutations that provided man with the necessary biological tools for that development were chosen for anything but language, in fact for long distance fast bipedal running, an essential characteristic for weak Homo Sapiens to survive in a hostile environment. Maybe Gondry and Chomsky should read Sally McBrearty, among others.

But what a challenge to enjoy both the discourse and the animation! The animation is quite creative indeed but it is a completely different message that is attached to Chomskys discourse, but the attachment is never the message, and in this case the attachment could be entirely analyzed as a work of art and we could analyze the difficult and at times tortuous mind of the artist, but I preferred considering the interview, though a second mute viewing would be fascinating. Didnt I say hypnotizing?

8640285,5,B00IA1VPL4,"Any work that engages substantially with the ideas of Noam Chomsky is well worth anyone's time. Michel Gondry does a good job of allowing Chomsky to express these ideas, while simultaneously providing the viewer with some entertaining and impressive images.

For those interested in Chomsky's scientific perspectives, this is a good introduction. In particular, covered are the ideas of generative grammar, inadequacy of a referential theory of semantics (meaning), and psychological nativism, ideas for which Chomsky has achieved renown.

However, I was quite disappointed. (I am so very glad I didn't yield to the temptation of spending $6.99 to see this on Amazon earlier.) First, Gondry's English pronunciation skills are horrendous. Even though his dialogue was written in the cartoon drawings, it was nonetheless very annoying and off-putting. I expended a lot of mental energy first trying to understand him, then trying to ignore that horrible noise while I tried to read the dialogue. Why not have someone with adequate English pronunciation skills narrate the film?  Second, even if Gondrys pronunciation had been spectacular, his unceasing penchant for interrupting Chomsky while Chomskys in the middle of making an important point was maddening. Really, Gondry? He was interviewing the father of modern linguistics, who is also a renowned and much beloved social activist, not to mention one of the most brilliant minds in human history, and Gondry couldn't hold his tongue long enough for Chomsky to complete his thoughts. Wow. All-in-all, with Gondrys insistence on being the narrator with such poor pronunciation skills, his unbelievable interruptions, and the fact that the drawings did not add anything of value to the film, I will just say better luck next time Gondry.",1401235200,9,1414,5.147826086956521
