7975699,5,B00007FPKH,"This video is so relaxing and calm for the baby and moreso, the mommy.  The music and imagery are so peaceful, which is a such a nice contrast to the crazy world and nonstop activities.",1247875200,2,185,4.285714285714286
7975700,5,B00007FPKH,"This is an awesome DVD. I can't believe how very peaceful and calming it is to watch, even as an adult. The beautiful music truly sets the mood. The DVD features beautiful images of clouds, flowers, insects, waterfalls, wind chimes and the most adorable babies you have ever seen. I can see how babies and toddlers would be totally fascinated by this DVD. It's NOT stimulating at all. In fact it's VERY relaxing and would be great to play on TV prior to nap time or bed time to help relax and calm your baby or toddler.",1232841600,2,519,4.360824742268041
7975701,5,B00007FPKH,"We both enjoy watching this dvd together! My one-year-old especially loves the babies and the dogs. It is a great unwinding type of dvd for the end of the day. It took her a little while to get used to the rhythm because she had only seen Baby Einstein dvds before I got this. Now she'll bring the case to me! The music may be too New Age for some, which I thought at first, but it really becomes inobtrusive. Great alternative to the endless slew of ""educational"" dvds available these days.",1107302400,,491,4.3478260869565215
7975702,5,B00007FPKH,"My eight month old twins love this video. I play the video at the end of the day as part of our bed time ritual. The video starts off stimulating and then ends up with soothing, calming and peaceful music and visuals. The babies love it and I look forward to watching their expressions when they see the bouncing balls, dogs, babies and colorful flowers. This video has saved me many a nights!",1072742400,3,393,4.397260273972603
7975703,4,B00007FPKH,"You can always tell if a video is well done when your children will watch it and ask to watch it everyday. My boys are 2 and 3 years old and they cannot seem to get enough of it. The pace of the scenes, the music, and the images all make this video very enjoyable and keeps the attention of children. We especially like the ideas it gives our boys to explore their surroundings, look at the sky, trees, flowers, and other objects. Very well done video. We are looking forward to more of these videos.",1042934400,3,500,4.21875
7975704,5,B00007FPKH,"I watched this video with my 2 year old son and we both loved it. This was the first video that he sat and watched all the way through. One of the things that sets it apart from other videos is the music. In one of the segments, ""let's play,""  he got up to dance and commented, ""this music is great."" It was stimulating, yet relaxing because the video takes you through the course of a child's day. My son and I now like to watch it just before bedtime. Overall it's just an exceptional video and I believe anyone who sees it will love it too.",1038355200,3,543,4.074766355140187
7975705,5,B00007FPKH,"Zen Baby is a wonderful, engaging video you can watch and enjoy with your baby.  There are several segments (so you can watch part or all of the video), and each one focuses on a specific part of your baby's day (i.e. ""Good Morning,"" or ""Let's Play"").  Our baby really enjoys watching the beautiful images on the screen and listening to the music and sounds in the video.  The video has a positive effect on mom and dad too - we both feel more relaxed every time we see it.
I found two benefits to this video:  one is watching the video with our baby, and the second is taking our baby outside to do some of the things we see in the video (such as feeling the cool grass between your toes on a sunny day).
Perhaps most importantly though, Zen Baby reminded me of the beauty in the simple things in our lives and how these things must look through the eyes of someone new to this world, like our children.
I highly recommend this video to babies of all ages (and their parents).",1038268800,,977,4.236559139784946
7975706,5,B00007FPKH,"I sat down to ""preview"" this video before playing it for my daughter.  I was entranced the entire time...what a beautiful, serene experience!  The video gently portrays colorful images of baby's first experiences of nature, accompanied by a selection of music perfectly suited to the tranquil yet happy tone the video projects.  My daughter loved the abundance of familar images: baby faces, bees, clouds, grass, water. She is much more interested in her ""Zen Baby"" video than any of the other ones we own.  Trust me, your baby (and you) will love this!",1038268800,,553,4.913978494623656
7975707,5,B00007FPKH,"I have seen this video, and it is really wonderful!  The images are appealing not only to myself, but to my 18-month old daughter. She enjoys the babies, and the bouncing balls, and the nature scenes. The music is nice as well. We have lots of videos, and it is refreshing to see a video that does not market toys, or anything that you need to buy, to parents and babies. This video inspires you to go for a walk with your child and discover the world together, or to just hang out after a busy day and wind down with images that you can talk about together, and that is familiar to your baby.",1038268800,,593,4.156521739130435
