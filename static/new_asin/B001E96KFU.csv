3715057,3,B001E96KFU,"I love the suspense that builds up over the course of an episode of Ghost Hunters, and that's exactly what's missing from this DVD. It's okay--but definitely prefer to watch an entire site visit play out even if nothing happens versus a highlight reel, no matter how cool it may be.",1373241600,3,282,4.549019607843137

8326388,1,B001E96KFU,It's not the same as volume one.  This is over priced to the extreme.  Nothing but a complete waste of money.  It's a top 20 moments and lasts about an hour.,1485302400,,157,4.0
