Casey Jones is also introduced. Took me a bit to adjust to him being younger, but the core of the character is totally intact.",1396915200,,312,4.886792452830188

Nickelodeons revival of  the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series has turned out to be an incredible success, with second and third seasons of the show ordered within weeks of the initial episode airing. Its easy to see why, as the Turtles recipe of action, humor and charm has managed to stay fully intact with this reincarnation. Following up on their release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Ultimate Showdown, which featured the final twelve episodes of Season One, Nick has released Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutagen Mayhem, collecting the first six episodes of Season Two.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutagen Mayhems six episodes showcase a great cast of voice talent. Featuring Jason Biggs (Leonardo), Rob Paulsen (Donatello  and the original Raphael from the 80s cartoon), Sean Astin (Raphael), Greg Cipes (Michelangelo), Kelly Hu (Karai) and Josh Peck (Casey Jones), everyone here does a solid job and fills their roles well. Peck makes his series debut on Mutagen Mayhem. Special mention needs to go to Hoon Lee and Kevin Michael Richardson, who are perfectly cast as the voices of Master Splinter and Shredder, respectively.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutagen Mayhem sees the four brothers rushing to recover 63 canisters of mutagen that have accidentally been dropped all over New York City. Unfortunately for them, new threats have already sprung up as a result of the ooze, and the Turtles come face to face with a number of them in this DVD set.  The Mutation Situation sees the group becoming a bit over-confident in their abilities after defeating Shredder and the Kraang, but their celebration is cut short by the arrival of new enemies in NYC  including a mutated Mr. ONeil, creating tension between April and the Turtles.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutagen Mayhems first episode,Follow The Leader has Leonardo struggling to keep his brothers in line, as they begin to disobey his orders. But when a new army of robot Foot soldiers enter the fray  able to predict and adapt to all of the Turtles moves  Leo learns that following orders isn't always the best way to get things done, and that being unpredictable can have its perks. Invasion of the Squirrelanoids pits the Turtles against a terrifying new foe  mutant squirrels that reproduce inside a host, evolving into an even more horrifying form  an obvious homage to the classic Alien horror films. Frankly I found this episode, as well as Mikey Gets Shellacne   where Michelangelo rubs mutagen on himself and begins to mutate into essentially a giant zit  a bit too gross and disturbing for children. And the horror film references seem out of place to me  its not something the Turtles have been known for previously. And Casey Jones redesign  its definitely going to take a while to get used to. Im used to a musclebound badass in a Jason mask, not a kid with a whole row of missing teeth that isn't any bigger than April.

Mutagen Man Unleashed sees the transformation of the kid formerly known as The Pulverizer into Mutagen Man, who Donnie thinks may be the key to finding a cure for Aprils father  a retro-mutagen. Unfortunately, Timmy is after April, and the Turtles have to team up with Casey Jones and employ some stealth and diversionary tactics to keep her safe. Mikey Gets Shellacne   while overall a pretty disgusting episode  sees the double-mutation of Dogpound into a much cooler, creepier, skeletal form, Rahzar (fans of the 80s movies will remember him). Finally, Target: April ONeil has the Kraang and Karai sending a new robotic creation after April, and she gets closer to Casey while trying to avoid the Turtles as much as possible. But when Donnie and the Turtles save her once again, she realizes that shes been treating them unfairly. As an aside, I really enjoy the shows that the Turtles watch, echoing whats going on in their lives  last season it was Space Heroes, and Mutagen Mayhem sees the debut of a 70s Voltron-esque series.

Unfortunately, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutagen Mayhem is really light on extras, but that should be expected if youve picked up any of the previous releases. The standard Mutation of a Scene shorts are here, showcasing how an episode comes together from storyboards to rough CGI to final render. Besides six of those, theres a very short extra titled Channel 6 News Report: Creatures of the Night, which features reporters talking about the mysterious sightings around town lately. I guess that the really good extras, like commentaries, cast interviews and full features are being saved for the eventual Blu-ray release.

Overall, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutagen Mayhem is a solid DVD set with six interesting, funny episodes, although a few of them weren't quite my cup of tea and may be too disturbing for children. Still, its a strong collection for fans of the series, but you may want to watch the episodes and use your own discretion before letting your kids see them. A few more extras definitely wouldnt hurt, either. While Mutagen Mayhem is likely my least favorite TMNT set released thus far on the whole, its still TMNT, and theres no denying that the two hours of entertainment on display here is still leagues above most other kids TV shows today.",1395014400,7,5254,4.936435868331442
6135852,5,B00H7BJ1XC,This is a great DVD featuring the first six episodes of Season 2 of the animated TMNT show.  It features over two hours of non-stop Turtle action and adventures.  Will they stop the villains?  Will they find more trouble?  My boys and I just recently watched the actual Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies and they are hooked now on the animated show since they have seen all the movies.  This is great because we can watch it on our own time.,1394928000,,442,4.407407407407407

6135874,5,B00H7BJ1XC,"My boys love these shows. Nothing to worry about language or anything. Got to keep them from fighting each other and hurting each other when they roll play from the show but it's all it good fun. The story line is pretty good too. I always liked the TMNT movies when I was younger. You can see different things in the epidsodes such as Ho Chin from ""Big Trouble Little China"" making an appearance (don't know if that is in this series). Makes me laugh and even keeps my interest at times.",1432771200,,488,4.315217391304348

6135882,5,B00H7BJ1XC,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is my all time favorite TV show (including all the different series aside from The Next Mutation which no one really likes).  Personally I feel this new Nickelodeon series is a fabulous edition to the TMNT franchise.  Nick has taken out all the things I didn't like from the previous series and combined all the things I did like into one really cool show.  I wasn't too sure about the animation style at first, but it grows on you rather quickly and now I actually rather like it.  All in all, I highly recommend this series, particularly to fans of the previous series.",1422662400,,600,4.579439252336448

6135912,4,B00H7BJ1XC,Of course this series is awesome. I give it five stars. I just hate the way they release 1 disc at a time. And the fact that one disc only contains 6 episodes and some useless extras that aren't really interesting to watch. Not to mention they still haven't released a combined season one package. But I guess that's how they milk the money out of a good product.,1397692800,3,363,4.27536231884058
