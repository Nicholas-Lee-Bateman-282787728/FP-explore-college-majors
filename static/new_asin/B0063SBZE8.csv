Ditte (Lene Marie Christensen) is happily in love with Peter (Pilou Asbk - Borgen - Series 1) and receives a very tempting job offer in New York. Peter is happy for both to move to New York and his friend Jason manages to find him a role to suit. Ditte however discovers she is pregnant and relasies that she cannot go to New York AND give birth to her first child at the same time. Peter seems to believe that they are young enough to go top Nrw York and have a baby later, but are they?
Ditte's father Rikard (Jesper Christensen) has built up a fine bakery and is even purveyor to the Danish Crown. Rikard has just been given an all clear from his doctors however his illness returns and this time he knows he is going to die. Further pressure is put upon Ditte to take over the running of the successful bakery and this means ruling out both options considered by herself and Peter. Rikard's second wife Sanne (Anne Louise Hassing - Krniken), who has given Rikard two further younger children, is determined that Rikard move into a hospice and not return home as is Ditte's wish.
En familie is a moving film from 2010 showing the difficulties facing a family and the relationships within it. All four of the main performers are fantastic in the film and I certainly felt it was 95 minutes well spent.
The film is entirely in Danish with English subtitles. There is also a very short extra on the disc showing a quick look at the opening night of the film in Denmark, however there are no subtitles on the extra feature.
Enjoy.",1340236800,,1629,4.433333333333334
8492178,5,B0063SBZE8,"This is a moving film, especially for those who've experienced the up and down emotions brought on by elder care and its inevitable result. If the ""elder"" being cared for is not so old, and the need for care comes as a surprise, it could be an even more harrowing experience, making this film even more crushing to watch.

The film begins with a history of Rheinwald family and its bakery told through black and white stills. Its current owner, Rikard Rheinwald, maintains its product and its quality. His feelings for the family legacy are central to his life and infuse all that he does.

Because the story needs to be told by the characters and not me, I will only say that as Rikard's health waxes and wanes it brings about changes in him and his family.  Elder care is difficult for any family, and this family is blindsided by it.  Ditte, the favored daughter, makes decisions for herself that affect others with the same insularity as her father. We, the outside viewer, can see this and other effects that the rest of the family cannot see but must cope with.

The technical qualities are very good.  The acting, the sets, the everyday clothing (yes, the same clothes are worn on different days ... just like real life) are excellent. The casting is notable too; the characters have a strong family resemblence.

I went to see this because in the last 3 months I saw 2 other top rate Danish films.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-a-Better-World-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B004G8QO7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In a Better World (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>, won both Golden Globes and Academy Awards.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Headhunter-2009-Head-Hunter-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Denmark/dp/B003VI2ILC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Headhunter (2009) ( Head Hunter ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Denmark </a>] is similar to a Coen Brothers crime saga but adds more style and verve.
