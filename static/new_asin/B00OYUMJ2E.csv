8685559,2,B00OYUMJ2E,"It is a good documentary that includes interviews with two of the best exorcists around the world such as Jos Fortea and Gabriel Amorth. However, the price of this DVD is too expensive also ""Titanium Enterteinement"" sells it in a series called ""Mysteries of Christianity"" at one much lower price. I consider very inconvenient to be sold the same movie with two different titles and different prices.

8685562,5,B00OYUMJ2E,"Where does one begin in trying to review a documentary of such depth and information? Not a minute passes without something profound, extraordinary and even astonishing is put forth to the viewer. This documentary is unsurpassed in its very detailed explanation of Exorcism, and is extremely beneficial to the viewer in making them understand this sacramental, which today has become very necessary.

To begin with, the contents of this presentation is as follows.

A panel of experts contribute to this documentary and they are as follows (by order of appearance):

1. Fr. Manuel Guerra Gomez, Professor of Theology from Burgos, Spain.
2. Alberto Vazquez Figuroa, Author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-seor-de-las-tinieblas-Spanish-Edition/dp/B00841EOK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El seor de las tinieblas (Spanish Edition)</a>
3. Fr. Jose Antonio Sayes, Professor of Theology and Research, Spain
4. Fr. Pedro Suner Puig, former exorcist from Barcelona, Spain
5. Dr. Aquilio Polaino, Professor of Psychopathology, Madrid, Spain
6. Fr. Gabriele Amorth, Official Exorcist of the Diocese of Rome, Italy;author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Exorcist-Tells-His-Story/dp/0898707102/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Exorcist Tells His Story</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Exorcist-More-Stories/dp/0898709172/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Exorcist: More Stories</a>
7. Fr. Jose Antonio Fortea, Exorcist and Demonologist, Spain who features in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Interview-with-an-Exorcist/dp/B00B5I5TW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Interview with an Exorcist</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exorcist-in-the-21st-Century/dp/B00BI6SPLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exorcist in the 21st Century</a>

Since this feature does not have a chapter or scene selection, it seems beneficial to address a number of topics that were discussed:
1. Catechesis on the cause of the fall of the angels.
2. The meaning of Lucifer`s `NO` to God.
3. The devil`s aims.
4. Why were Adam and Eve tempted?
5. Why was Eve tempted first?
6. What ""...deliver us from evil..."" from the Lord`s Prayer means.
7. Imagery/ artistic representations of the devil
8. What the Popes have said about Satan.
9. Possessions; determining their authenticity, nature.
10. What causes possessions
11. Exorcisms
12. Manifestations of the devil during exorcisms
13. Conclusions:Should we fear the devil?

This is by no means an exhaustive list though it may appear to be one. Much, much more is discussed in this film. Hence it is by far the most authoritative documentary on this subject.
Particularly noteworthy is the role of Freemasonry which is briefly mentioned, as well as spiritualism and witchcraft. Particularly horrifying are the rituals associated with Satanism.
Also the Church`s eagerness to cooperate with doctors and psychologists is well presented, altogether dispelling the cliched myth that the Church is closed to science, when she embraces it more than  any other religious institution in history and has contributed to it.

Fr. Gabriele Amorth is extremely edifying in the manner he presents the rite of exorcism and he goes to great lengths in trying to teach the viewer every aspect of it. And does he have a few surprises for you!

Actual footage of exorcisms are shown with the narrative and this is particularly effective.

In a time of great spiritual lethargy and lukewarmness, with people drifting further and further away from God, and an atheistic rationalism prevails among society,even causing downright hostility towards religion and in particular the holy Catholic faith;and at a time when mankind dabbles in all sorts of occult activity without realizing the consequences it has on them and the people that may surround them, this feature presentation brings to light the reality of the devil and the spiritual battle that every one of us is engaged in. This will be really an eye opener to everyone who watches it.

This documentary is 55 minutes long (remarkable feat indeed to have all this information in such a short time! Truly power packed!) in English or Spanish (dual language tracks). The interviews with the experts from Spain are in Spanish with English voice-over and with Fr. Amorth it is in Italian with English dubbing.

There are no subtitles and no special features except for movie trailers from Ignatius Press.

To conclude, to quote Blessed Paul VI (taken from this film): ""Evil is not just a spiritual deficiency, but a living being;spiritual deviant and perverse. That dark and disturbing being exists and is constantly acting with the astuteness of a traitor.""",1419120000,9,4820,6.166915052160954
