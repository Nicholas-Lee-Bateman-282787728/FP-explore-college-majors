2259743,5,B0008JIRRG,"Do not think that this workout is going to be easy on you.  It's amazing and tough and it will kill.  You may not have use of your legs for quite a few days later.  It is excellent, but be warned - it's tough.

Cathe is one of the better instructors out there.  I've loved so many of her other workouts and this also is good.  There are two sections - one is standing toning and the other is floor toning.  You will practically work every single muscle you have in your legs and butt.  She always cues well so you know what to do next.  The part I like the best is the fact that you can play shorter ""timesaver"" versions of the whole entire workout by using a feature that's on the dvd called a Premix.  That way, you don't really have a good excuse for not doing at least 10 minutes or so of some good.

If you are wanting tight and toned legs, this is the workout for you.  If you do it with cardio, you'll have amazing legs and you'll soon see a lot of definition in them.  That's part of my motivating factor to sweat it out with this great dvd.",1162598400,15,1049,4.009661835748792
2259744,5,B0008JIRRG,Cathe is the absolute best at advanced weight workouts. This DVD guarentees to tighten and tone legs & glutes.,1140480000,7,110,4.842105263157895
2259745,5,B0008JIRRG,"Get ready to trim those chubby legs...I do this EVERY other day - and what a pay-off....I LOVE Cathe's videos. She is easy on the ears, and does a GRREAT job coaching !!!",1338940800,4,170,4.181818181818182
2259746,5,B0008JIRRG,"I love this workout!  It is hard enough to make me feel like it is worth the effort and just the right length of time.  I will usually add 20-30 minutes of cardio beforehand and skip Cathe's warm-up.  During some of the lunge and squat sequences I get a cardio effect also.  It is hard while in the middle of it but I ALWAYS feel great about it afterwards--even while my muscles are shaking and I am drenched in sweat.  You do need some equipment; I substitute a pair of 18 lb dumbbells for the barbell sequences and I have a firm step not a ""step"" step.  The bottom line is it works!",1282176000,,584,4.123893805309734
2259747,5,B0008JIRRG,I purchased this DVD because I saw one of Cathe's workouts on THE fit tv channel and loved it so I decided to see if she had any workouts on DVD. There are a lot of workout videos that claim to workout your legs but they don't. This one by far is one of the best DVDs I have ever purchased to workout my legs.  I was sore for 4 days.  Absolutely love this DVD.,1259539200,,360,3.7866666666666666
2259748,5,B0008JIRRG,It took a couple of days before I could walk properly again. It fried my calf muscles:-) What a workout!  This really targets all the muscles in your legs and combining it with a little cardio will give you a great workout.,1257206400,2,223,4.309523809523809
2259749,5,B0008JIRRG,"Like the other reviewers, I agree that this is a very comprehensive, get down to business DVD. The workout accomplishes the goal of giving you a complete leg workout to muscle failure. The variety of weights, a step, a band and ball helps get to different muscle fibers. I have a back injury so I can't do the dead lifts. I did only the standing portion and 2 days later I could hardly walk.  When I spend my time working out I want to see results, and this workout delivered.",1247270400,8,476,4.288888888888889
2259750,5,B0008JIRRG,Gymstyles legs hits every muscle fiber in your legs - it is extremely thorough and there is a good mix of standing leg work and floor work.  I have made tremendous strength gains with the Gymstyles series.,1221696000,3,205,4.54054054054054
2259751,5,B0008JIRRG,"This is a great DVD  for legs. I have only used the Pre-Mixes so far and can't imagine the pain I'll be in when I finally do the full routine. This is a good change from my standard lower body routine. If you're in a total time-crunch, the 33 min. Pre-Mix is perfect.  The 49 min. Pre-Mix does not include Calf-specific exercises.  I recommend this video to anyone who wants to do it on a regular basis or as a change from their standard routine. Your thighs will be quivering.",1203897600,5,477,4.277777777777778
2259752,5,B0008JIRRG,"I have a love/hate relationship with this workout.  I love it because I know it is working and I can barely walk for two days after but I dread doing it when leg day rolls around because it is long and challenging.  I still have yet to finish all of the calf raises, there are so many!",1202428800,2,285,3.982456140350877
2259753,5,B0008JIRRG,"I came across Cathe one morning on FIT TV.  I've been addicted to her ever since.  I usually workout with one specific person, but I needed variety.  I LOVE Cathe's workouts.  They are hard but great workouts!!!  I would definately add her to your workout collection.",1188000000,3,267,4.717391304347826
2259754,4,B0008JIRRG,"Cathe Friedrich has come up with quite a leg workout here, approximately 67 minutes long, she will fry your lower half with standing and floorwork exercises.  A barbell, assorted dumbells, step or stool, a resistance band and a stability ball are the equipment used in this workout.

You start with a well needed warmup, then proceed into the standing portion of the workout.  You will start with barbell squats, 3 sets with the third set adding bonus reps.  Next you will go into a series of forward and reverse lunges, Cathe goes pretty light on the weights compared to other workouts I have seen of hers, but there are plenty of pulsing reps which will really fry your legs.  Following this are plie squats, again using fairly light weights but more pulsing reps which will fry even more.  Then you will see a leg press using a resistance band rather than dumbells, which is a nice variation but will get your legs good.  Finishing out the set are deadlifts, including an advanced but optional variation using a step for the second set, and a killer set of slow motion lunges.  Cathe only uses 5 pound weights but they are slow and torturous, I am lucky if I can complete the set without stopping.  Finally you will complete the standing segment with some tough calf work.

The floorwork segment is even harder, if that's possible.  She will toast your legs even more with a variety of floorwork exercises using a stability ball and resistance band.  She hits it all, inner and outer thighs, hamstrings and glutes.  I have only done the floorwork segment once on it's own as I am usually too spent after the standing section to go on, but it's certainly killer in it's own right, very tough.

Overall a fantastic lower body workout that will work your legs to the max.  Anyone looking for a lower body challenge will find it here, if not in the standing work, the floorwork for sure.  There are also premixes with shorter options if one chooses.  4 and a half stars for this one.",1180224000,21,1982,4.5852272727272725
8056402,5,B0008JIRRG,she always has great videos!  love this workout.,1508371200,,48,5.0
8056403,4,B0008JIRRG,"I like this video but wish there were modification presented for different fitness levels and for those with bad knees or other injuries. (There are tons of squats, lunges, plies, and more lunges that people with knee problems probably shouldn't do.) Along with Cathe there are four other women in the video, and all do the same exercises (no advanced, intermediate, or beginner movements, or modifications are shown).

Still, there are a lot of good exercises and Cathe's direction and cuing is impeccable.",1502409600,2,507,5.108433734939759
8056404,5,B0008JIRRG,All I have to say is that it is a tough workout love cathe she knows her stuff that's for sure,1499558400,,94,3.5238095238095237

8056406,5,B0008JIRRG,"This is hands down the best lower body workout I have ever done. It works every inch of your legs and booty!  It is very challenging, like all Cathe's workouts, but so worth it. You need this workout in your life! :)",1449014400,,216,4.142857142857143
8056407,4,B0008JIRRG,Love her toughness!,1421020800,,19,5.666666666666667
8056408,5,B0008JIRRG,"This is such a great strength training workout. You can really go heavy. Cathe's cuing is great. She really delivered a great workout with this one. My calf muscles felt like they had been ripped apart, in such a good way. I couldn't walk for two days! This workout will be a great addition to any strength training routine.",1371081600,2,324,4.508474576271187
