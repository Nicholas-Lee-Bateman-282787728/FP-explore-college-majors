1273225,1,B00003CXL6,"Audra (the reviewer below) and I must be blood sisters because everything she said in her review I agree with 100% and then some.  I'm a big Richard Gere fan and like almost every movie just because I get to watch him.  This movie is so bad that I started to even hate Richard Gere.  Not to mention that Winona Ryder was SO unconvincing (why did this womanizer fall in love with her anyway?  There is absolutely no reason in the movie to show why they are suddenly in love) that I was rooting for her death early on in the movie.  I don't want to give away the plot, but by the end, let's just say that I felt a bit better about the movie overall.  Everything about this film was bad:  pathetic plot development, poor supporting roles, dialogue so bad that you may find yourself wincing over and over again, unimaginative cinematography that doesn't even make New York look good in Autumn, cheesy scenes... I won't go on.  Not much chemistry either between the two.  It's been months since I've hated a movie this much, and I think that says a lot since I love Gere and I had pretty low expectations -- this one sunk even lower than that.  Read a good book instead.",978825600,2,1165,4.3271889400921655
1273226,1,B00003CXL6,"This movie is really quite awful.  I watched it on my DVD player coming back to the United States from Europe.  I don't know if it was airsickness, or the foulness of this movie that made me so nauseous.
Here's why it's so bad:  it insults you, the viewer.  It does this first because of issues of implausibility.  The ""sick"" Ryder character has signed some ""papers"" which expressly forbid doctors from performing any life-saving surgery on her.  The writer thought that because we're all familiar with ""D.N.R."" orders from watching E.R. on Thursday nights that we would think this was somehow plausible.  And I won't spoil any surprises for you if I tell you that she is moved to sign new papers so that she doesn't have to part from her newfound love and successful restauranteur, played by Gere.  Presumably, life wasn't alluring enough before he came along to bother trying to remedy her fatal ailment.
Second, how are we supposed to find Gere's character appealing?  I'm as smitten with his silvery locks as the next gal, but his character is a deadbeat dad who shags another woman on a roof while he's at a party on a date with Ryder's terminally ill character.  This is a sympathetic character how?  I understand the semiotics of Hollywood well enough to know that the makers of this film want us to run the gamut of emotions: we are to identify with Ryder's character and to feel terrible hurt, indignation, anger, jealousy, and grief. And when Gere comes groveling back, one is to feel more outrage, vindication, anxiety, hope, and finally love for those aforementioned locks.
But I just thought: ""Gross, what a loser and a lech."" Hollywood is trying to tell us that deceit, betrayal, and irresponsibility are somehow charming. They are not. Nor are they forgivable when a gal has less than a year to live.  What happened to her friends after the opening scene? Ryder's character is apparently one of those chics who abandons her friends as soon as she finds romance.  Her character disappoints in so many ways.  She is a fragile, victimized, wisp of a wimpy waif.  Albeit a very pretty one.
The Cinderella element which runs throughout the film is the source of many problems, not the least of which is that is depicts men as the sole benefactors of women's happiness. But I point out the Cinderella motif because I wish to include my mom's criticism of the film:  how is it that the dress for the ""ball"" fit her so perfectly?  And most nagging of all: where did she get her shoes?  Bippety-boppety-boo!",977788800,34,2513,4.698630136986301
1273227,1,B00003CXL6,"I am not a baseball fan but as I understand it being a Cubs fan is as much a measure of loyalty as anything.  They watch there team lose, but they never give up, it's there team by golly and they stick by them.  In the Year 2000, being a fan of Winona Ryders is not all that different. I forgive as the baseball fan who watches his team lose 13 to zip forgives, perhaps next year.  When one is a devoted fan one can look beyond the horrendous film your idol has made.  I tried to look beyond autumn in New York, really I tried.  A comedy is unfunny if nobody laughs.  A tearjerker, by the same measure, is no good unless somebody, anybody cries.  Nary a tear was shed at the theater I was in, one of those discount theaters where the films are $2.00, even the little girls, you know, the ones who go to movies to cry, the ones who made Titanic a big hit, they seemed bored and they should have.  I won't add to the boredom by telling you the plot, it suffices to say that a doomed relationship between an older man and a terminally ill young women is told through endless scenes of leaves and finally snow falling in parks, ornaments falling in slow motion from Christmas trees, on and on.  People cried for Old Yeller, and when Dumbos Mom was wrongly accused there was not a dry eye in the house, no one cried for Violet, no one cared.  Why should they?  I can picture Winona Ryder, Claire Danes and John Travolta, all sitting in a bar drinking and wondering where it all went horribly wrong.",977011200,4,1493,4.203508771929824
1273228,1,B00003CXL6,"It was a hot August day when I saw this movie.  We went in to escape the heat.  I cannot remember a bad a movie as this stinker.  The dialogue is horrendous, the acting abysmal, but it was pretty to look at, albeit with headphones playing some nice classical music. I was embarrassed for all involved.  I have a feeling this movie will make many 10 worst movie lists of the year.",976147200,5,379,4.222222222222222
1273310,2,B00003CXL6,Totally unrealistic! A play boy who is almost 50 supposedly falls in love with a women who could be his daughter who is 22 years old. The only reason he even gives the relationship a chance is because she tells him she's sick and may die. This is just another unrealistic romance movie that could never happen in real life. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because Richard Gere and Winona Ryder gave outstanding performances as actors. But the story is completely out of touch with reality.

1273314,4,B00003CXL6,"This was a very touching and lovely love story. The film got a lot of flack and bad reviews but I enjoyed it. I thought Richard Gere was convincing and realistic as Will. The only problem was Winona Ryder. She has always been a terrible actress. She can barely talk. The actors had NO chemistry at all but if not for Richard Gere and the decent writing this would have really been awful. Ryder stunk and I never understood why they kept putting her in so many movies back in the day but that proves Hollywood cares more about popularity than talent. By the time this film was made Ryder's A-list days were far behind her and it's obvious this was a comeback attempt for her that failed miserably. I can't explain how horrific her acting was in this and Gere almost looked embarrassed swapping lines back and forth with her. The May/December romance was interesting but would have been a perfect movie if they'd gotten a woman who could act.

By the way, I cried in the scene where he whispered he loved her. That was one of the most beautifully touching scenes I've witnessed in a romantic movie. You'll need a few hankies for this one.",1504310400,,1136,4.461538461538462

The plot lines were so predictable, it became humorous. I was fascinated by the cliches.

Playboy meets girl of his dreams - who of course has a terminal illness, so of course he feels safe and falls in love. Learns life lessons. Her health crisis comes at Christmas (of course) when the Christmas tree is lit. Cut to white doves flying into the sky - and don't ya know it, our heroine died.

1273369,2,B00003CXL6,"This movie is pretty hard to watch. Not because of bad acting or the storyline, but because Gere and Rider have absolutely zero chemistry. The love scenes were painfully embarrassing, everything about them was just awkward to the point that I would cover my eyes with my hands and laugh. I don't care that it was a film about a younger woman falling in love with an older man--the casting was just all wrong. Gere is fine as the main male character, but Rider should never have been cast. Anyone ever see the Bruce Willis movie ""Color of Night""? He plays a psychologist who falls in love with Jane March, who is 20+ years younger than him and it worked cause they actually did have chemistry, unlike what we see in ""Autumn in New York"".",1492300800,6,736,4.45925925925926
1273410,2,B00003CXL6,"What can I say differently from some of the others?  I do agree that the connection was not there, since this was a love story.  Richard seemed almost uncomfortable at times during the kissing moments.  Winona looked as though she was picking up the slack, by trying to add some passion.  Both are good actors, Winona mostly, but maybe a more believable actor would have been better.  I do like both actors, but not in this movie.",1492128000,,430,4.532467532467533

But then the ""terminally ill"" announcement threw me for a curve and I was hooked on the story line.  Couldn't wait to see how her illness affected things. The infidelity thing on the roof top ticked me off....squashed all hopes I had for a real love story.  Ugh.

It's the blatant womanizing, lying, deadbeat dad, and crazy lifestyle of Gere's character, and the creepiness that he is preying upon the daughter of an old flame (like mother, like daughter? Ew). Yeah yeah, he turns out to be the good guy in the end, or whatever.

1274753,4,B00003CXL6,"I feel this was a very moving story... I more than half expected a happier ending... but sometimes its good to feel the tears well up some. The greatest challenge in acting is the ability to portray realistic emotions. Not easy to do if conflicting thoughts and beliefs get in the way. The depth of love and passion that Will had for Charlotte in this movie felt a tad bit shallow based on his kiss... We women know. Ms. Ryder was ready, but Greer was holding back and it showed. If this is because of his personal issues with their age difference, I would say that displays his underlying respect for Ryder in real life -- to the degree I would guess that if given the opportunity in real life, he'd could never have sex with her. So, in that case, the depth of passion was lacking in those moments, undoubtedly for a good cause... although there were other moments Greer could have portrayed more realistic emotions, as well... and if he did, I believe Ms. Ryder would have followed suit and we'd all feel the depth of passion we desire!  But otherwise its a good plot with beautiful people and an enjoyable movie worth watching. :)",1482710400,,1134,4.478260869565218

Given Gere's exceptionally good looks at age 51 (in 2000) was there something incongruous in his pairing off with a woman 22 years younger? No. The age difference that so many emphasize (impossible to develop the right chemistry with such an age gap, there is something ""immoral"" in such May-Autumn couplings, etc.) is not so uncommon in real life--""trophy"" women often are even younger. They can both fully participate in a very broad range of life's activities, including raising children to adulthood while still hale.

To his credit, Gere avoided those ""cutesy"" smiles and postures that have turned me off in the past. His acting performance (as Winona's) is solid. The storyline moves along at a good pace with no embarrassing pauses. After close examination, I can find no serious flaws with this movie. If not 5 stars, it certainly deserves 4 1/2.",1482364800,,1064,4.93854748603352

1275232,1,B00003CXL6,"I'm sorry everything that is said about this movie is true.  It's bad in the way that a cliche filled, sappy and completely cheesy movie can be.  I can't wrap my head around why Will would want to have anything to do with Charlotte once he discovers that she is dying and it's not going to be one of his quick flings.  Now it's a highly complicated and emotionally draining one.  A womanizer of his caliber would have been long gone - the same womanizer that had little to nothing to do with his daughter all of these years.  Why would Charlotte want to put someone else through the pain of loving her when it's going to end the way it does?  The timeline is way off - I can't believe the two of them were swept away in this romance to the extent that it's bigger than the two of them and they can't help themselves.

AINY holds up fairly well for its age-- the plot seems plausible for at least the two hours of the running time, the performances are serviceable, and both leads make an effort at justifying attraction despite a 30- year age difference. Plus there is plenty of handkerchief soaking opportunity. The film does not set up the moral dilemmas of Me Before You, but then again, it's not supposed to. Instead, it's designed to leave men more faithful, women more grateful for good health, and both envious of how ridiculously good looking the main characters are..

1275489,3,B00003CXL6,"Autumn in New York is a romantic drama film that stars Richard Gere, Winona Ryder,Anthony LaPaglia,Elaine Stritch and Vera Farmiga. It was written by Allison Burnett. The screenplay was about a successful middle- aged restaurateur and womanizer who falls in love with a sweet young woman who is terminally ill. It was directed by Joan Chen.

An man gets an unexpected lesson in love and life from a much younger woman in this romantic drama. Will Keane is a wealthy 50-year-old restaurant tycoon who has a knack for wooing beautiful women, but is unable to commit to a lasting relationship. On day Will meets a beautiful woman in her early-20s named Charlotte Fielding; he turns on the charm in an effort to impress her, and soon the two are having an affair. But what Will thought would be a brief, casual fling proves to have far deeper repercussions when he learns that Charlotte is suffering from a serious illness and does not have long to live.

The movie is a clichd,formulaic and predictable melodrama. Also,it was weak and unmemorable. Even the presence of Richard Gere and Winona Ryder could not save this film. Also,their lack of chemistry only increased the many flaws this film has. They look unrealistic being a couple due to their 20+ year age difference. The only good thing about it is it generate genuine emotions in some scenes. Nothing more.",1428710400,3,1361,4.811965811965812

1275685,2,B00003CXL6,"I broke an ancient principle in choosing to purchase this DVD: I judged a movie by its title. The idea of the beautiful autumn color in Central Park in Manhattan seems SOOOO romantic to a southerner who has never lived in a climate that really HAS an autumn season with the changing leaves and the blooming of fall-weather flowers and daytime temperatures that dip into the 50's BEFORE Christmas. I also wanted a nostalgic look at what Manhattan USED to look like... well, you know... ""before."" There are several establishing shots of the NY skyline with the Twin Towers in silhouette; in the sun, the rain, the snow and the fog. Of course, they aren't featured in any special way... because we all took them for granted then. They would be there forever.

But about the movie. Richard Gere and Winona Ryder are rather far down the list of ""favorite"" actors. To be fair, I don't care for 98% of the actors I'm familiar with so I was already going to be a little biased against them (he was alright here, but I didn't care for Ryder in this film.) But the script and the story don't even do THEIR talents justice; it's painfully and embarrassingly contrived. A confirmed and dedicated bachelor-slash-womanizer finally meets his muse in a very young woman... who is terminally ill. And who will probably expire before the film is over. She has special gifts and ""powers""; she can quote Emily Dickinson off the cuff, hang strings and strings and STRINGS of beads in every empty space, she can make odd-looking things out of unusual materials that she calls ""hats"" but are really more like fascinators, aaaaand she can tell when Gere's character, Will, has cheated on her with another woman by simply putting her hand over his heart. She says that, because she is ""sick"" in HER heart, by doing that she can automatically tell when someone is lying to her. (Cringe.) Really, this storyline might actually be a nice one for young teenage girls who still like to play make-believe with such idealized notions, but OTOH, there are several scenes of where casual sex is taking place (no graphics, just clever camera angles) and scenes that imply casual sex has taken place. Even as sweet as the fairytale is, I'm not sure I would care to have my 13yr-old daughter see that and make romantic assumptions about sex that aren't based in reality. It's also a little creepy that a 50yr-old man is attracted to someone who is still quite childlike; neither Ryder nor her character are minors, but she certainly could pass for one if need be. I just think that grown men who are attracted to young girls (and young-looking girls) are a little... deviant.

I can see where the film makers thought this might have a sort of ""Pretty Woman"" appeal to it, and they cast Gere in it opposite a very pretty and unconventional young woman who would capture his character's elusive heart and make an honest man out of him. But it falls flat. It's been done too many times (almost from the time ""talkies"" started) and is full of too many ancient cliches that just don't gel in modern society. Why 2 stars instead of 1? Because it's really and truly beautiful to look at. The cinematography is breath-taking and creates a poignant atmosphere that I can't quite dismiss entirely. It made me want to visit New York in Autumn.

The soundtrack is wonderful, both the original score and the old jazz classics. It really contributes to the wonderful atmosphere of the film. The original score is done by Gabriel Yared, and the brief piece labeled ""Elegy for Charlotte"" is alone worth the price of the whole CD (if you can't download it as an MP3.)",1360281600,,3613,4.65987460815047

1275692,5,B00003CXL6,"I'm struck by the polarization of reviews of this film, and cannot help but wonder why. I buy a lot of movies based on a lot of reviews, but I rarely see a distribution of reviews like this. Frankly, this is the best I've seen from either lead actor, and their performances help to make this a GREAT movie for a first or second date.

Also, by virtue of both story line and writing, this film is one of the best I've seen in the romance genre for some time. With regard to the writing, I was repeatedly struck by how fresh, direct, and honest all of the dialogue was. More was ""laid on the table,"" so to speak, than I am used to seeing in a film of this genre. The character of Mr. Gere's character was painfully exposed in a number of scenes, and he was allowed to grapple with it in a real and compelling way.

------ A ""Politically Incorrect"" Discussion of Male Emotionally Arrested Development -------

At a deeper level, I was struck by the moral dimension as it was portrayed through the lens of gender. From a male point of view, Mr. Gere's character is totally believable and totally natural. One would hope that he would have grown out of the ""womanizing"" portion of it by 48 years of age, but men succumbing serially to the charms of women is what we men do (with considerable support from women).

At some point (for some, much later than others), most men grow out of ""womanizing,"" (or give up the endeavor when it becomes too much effort). But in this, and other, films ""womanizing,"" as it is unsympathetically called, is not cast as a developmental issue. Instead it is portrayed by the lead female character as a moral one.

Mr. Gere's character had the assets to string ""womanizing"" out well into middle age (again, with considerable help from women). However, it might more productively be discussed in terms of arrested development (the ""Peter Pan"" or ""Hugh Hefner"" syndrome, perhaps) than in moral terms (i.e. when sexually involved with one woman, it is morally wrong to have sex with another).

Yes, lying is often involved and it is disagreeable. But, calling it ""morally wrong"" is to selectively and conveniently ignore context. If you doubt this, consider how often women (and I imagine, to a lesser degree, men) feel compelled to lie by withholding information about one member of their family from one or more others in it. The rationale in very often to avoid causing pain ""unnecessarily"" to those kept in the dark.

Had I to guess, I imagine that Mr. Gere's character was far less concerned about his own discomfort with his behavior than in sparing Miss Ryder's character's feelings. Recall, that this man made a point of being very clear from the beginning that there was no future other than the present. Also recall that this is a man (character) who had probably understood all his adult life that he could have sex four nights out of every seven with different women. Finally, bear in mind that he did not lie to Miss. Ryder's character. When she asked, he evaded her questions so badly that it was really a form of admission. SHE was the one who pounced by defining a ""womanizer"" as ""a man who has sex with lots of women and is very good at lying about it.""

I grant that Gere's character was not acting out of altruism. He wished to spare his own feelings as well. Men are not stupid, and it doesn't take much experience with women to know that they are going to be REALLY upset to discover that the man with whom they want an exclusive relationship is just not ready/willing/able to reciprocate.

Women, if you want the truth from men, consider doing two things that are more difficult than immediately wrapping yourselves in the flag of morality: First, understand that every man learns to lie to women by feeling compelled to lie to his mother. The point is that men do not feel emotionally COMFORTABLE lying anymore than women do. They feel emotionally COMPELLED to do so.

So, if you want honesty ABOVE ALL ELSE, then lay the ground work for it from the beginning, and teach the guy that you can forgive ANYTHING more easily than you can forgive a LIE. If you are consistent in this, YOU are far likelier to win in the end. Gosh! What a concept. This lets the man know that honesty is the most important thing you want and need from him (if that is true, otherwise, at least assert that honesty is so important that, breaching it will be a ""deal breaker"" for the relationship).

Second, SLOW DOWN. YOU may be ready to have sex because YOU are ready to be monogamous, but YOU are not the only one in the relationship, and YOUR needs are not the only ones that are important (if in fact it is a lasting relationship that you want).

Men are ready to have sex LONG BEFORE they are ready to settle into a monogamous relationship. This IS NOT rocket science. IF you make yourself available for sex BEFORE HE is where YOU are, then YOU risk YOUR heart.

IF you want the relationship to last long enough to see if it is what you BOTH want, then don't sabotage the process that neither of you created... BE PATIENT (and abstinent) until you BOTH know enough about the other to know YOUR HEARTS.

Doing this does not guarantee true love forever, but it changes the odds GREATLY in its favor. This is why the so called ""Sexual Revolution"" of the 1960s to present has worked against the REAL NEEDS of women.

When it comes to sex, men are VERY TRAINABLE. However, once trained, they (we) are VERY DIFFFICULT to re-train, entrain, etc. This is not their (our) fault. It is, with RARE exception, their (our) Nature and you transgress/cross/ignore that Nature at your own peril.

Once you (and your sisters) train men to enjoy sex outside of committed relationships, the inconvenient truth is that when you decide you are ready for commitment, your chosen guy is just as likely as not to move on to another woman who is only too ready to take your place. Ultimately, this works against the best interest of males as well as females)by encouraging their adolescence indefinitely (as Mr. Gere's character demonstrates only too well).",1295395200,3,6058,4.564456721915286

1275781,5,B00003CXL6,"Years ago, I spent a fair amount of time with the University of Washington's Professor Charles Johnson. For those of you who don't know, Chuck Johnson won the National Book Award in 1990 for his novel Middle Passage, and was rated by the Los Angeles Times as one of the top 10 literary short story writers in America. I'm not going to BS you with any ""my good friend Chuck Johnson"" stories; Chuck was best friends with one of my best friends, so I wound up tagging along on numerous ""visiting Chuck at his house"" nights.

Anyway, since I had expressed an interest in literary fiction, about which I knew essentially nothing, Chuck loaned me a book called The Best Literary Short Stories of the Year - one of which was written by him. I read that entire book. And it was hard. Hard, hard. Because - aside from Chuck's story ""Kwoon"" which was great - these stories were the most mind-numbingly boring things imaginable. All I could think was, ""And these are the year's BEST literary short stories? I shudder to imagine the worst."" I gave the book back to Chuck, with thanks, and was honest about my reaction. I'll never forget what he told me then, partly because it surprised me, coming from someone so lauded within the literary fiction community:

""You're right, most literary fiction IS boring. For two reasons: (1) Most literary fiction is autobiographical - and most literary writers have led pretty boring lives. (2) Most literary fiction is about weak people with small problems that they can't solve.""

What does all that have to do with Autumn in New York? I'm glad you asked! I thought of Chuck Johnson's comment while, and after, watching this film, because Autumn in New York could, almost, be a literary movie. Only this is not a story about weak people with small problems that they can't solve. This is a story about strong people with a big problem that they can't solve, and is thus immensely more interesting.

Director Joan Chen does an oustanding job in this movie, as does her director of photography, Chang Wei Gu. New York City, clad in autumn leaves or winter snow, is luminously captured, almost a character in the story itself. Richard Gere and Winona Ryder each give the best performance I've ever seen from them. (These are not exactly unknown actors who've never done anything impressive before, so that's saying something.) Chen is smart enough to let the camera linger on both their faces during intense scenes, so we can appreciate every nuance of subtle facial experession, just how damn GOOD both these people are at their jobs.

Richard Gere portrays Will Keane, shallow, handsome, womanizing, 48-year-old, successful New York restauranteur who finds himself falling in love with Ryder's 22-year-old Charoltte Fielding. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as just another example of the ""hot young girl falls in love with a man twice her age"" film so despised by many women. As one woman put it, ""This is a male fantasy. What is this beautiful young woman going to do, be around to ease him into his dotage?"" Usually in such a movie the age difference is never mentioned. However Autumn in New York is much smarter than that. The age difference gets discussed between these two a LOT, especially early on, and Charlotte makes it clear she's absolutely thrilled to be the object of interest of a sucessful, famous, older guy who looks exactly like Richard Gere. Not exactly a stretch there. Besides, Charlotte has news for Will. She's dying, with probably less than a year to live, so it's not like being around to ""ease him into his dotage"" is a major concern for her.

It's been said that what makes characters interesting in fiction is the amount of change we can watch them go through. In that sense, Will is the most interesting character in the movie. Charlotte is beautiful and charming and playful and intelligent, and it's totally believable that even this dedicated playboy would find himself falling for her. But throughout the movie she's the same wonderful person as when we first meet her. Will, on the other hand, finds his relationship with Charlotte working profound changes, oftentimes none too gently, in his entire personality.

The scenes with Will and Charlotte are so well-written, their dialogue so witty and touching, this could almost, were it not for the looming spectre of Charlotte's impending death, be a romantic comedy. In that regard I have to give Autumn in New York full props for avoiding the great pitfall of romantic comedies, what I've heard called the Idiot Plot Device. The IPD is that misunderstanding between the two main characters, typically occurring about 20 minutes from the end of the film, that temporarily splits them up before the unrealistically easy reconciliation at the end, and is so-called because the only way this could ever happen in real life is if both people were idiots. Even a movie as otherwise well-done as How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days falls victim to the Idiot Plot Device, but again Autumn in New York is much smarter than that. We do see Charlotte and Will split, but the reason they do so is anything but idiotic, and their reconciliation anything but conveniently easy.

Autumn in New York says that loving is better than not loving, that love opens you up to the possibility of being hurt, perhaps severely, but in the final analysis is better than never having loved. This is not a happy little movie. But it is an extraordinarily well-done film that will haunt you, and stay in your mind and heart long after the end credits roll. There are few enough movies of which we can say that.",1204934400,,5596,4.744090441932168

Richard Gere, in my opinion, does a poor acting job in this movie and doesn't seem all that believable as the leading man in this movie. Sure Gere makes nice eye candy, but that is about it.

Normally I enjoy the roles that Winona Ryder plays and find her acting to be wonderful.... However, I was sorely disappointed in the shallow development of the Ryder's character by the writers of this movie.

The only redeeming feature of this movie was that it didn't have the typical/predictable Hollywood ending.",1200787200,7,688,4.532258064516129
1275783,5,B00003CXL6,"(WARNING!  This contains plot spoilers!)

This is an unusual film in the sense that you'd think, from the cover and the brief DVD case description, that this is pure chick-flick, complete with sappy love scenes and a tear-jerker ending.

Well, you'd be right!  Yet there is trememdous depth to this film.  What makes this movie larger than the sum of its parts is that this is a film about the profound changes that a man's inner heart, and identity, undergo when he encounters the love of a good woman.  This is not romantic fantasy, nor is this melancholy for its own sake.  This is a very deep film about real love.

Gere plays Will, a sophisticated, if somewhat amoral, restauranteur in New York.  His life, while not aimless, is empty.  He takes no risks, particularly not in love.  He has a daughter from a previous ""fling"", with whom he has no relationship.  He seeks to be a good businessman, but his inner world and heart have atrophied.  Enter Winona Ryder's character, Charlotte, who quickly and, admittedly, quite predictably, changes all of that.

What one must keep in mind here is that the magic in this film is not in whether it's predictable, nor is it in Charlotte's Hollywood heart disease that allows her to remain radiantly gorgeous even as her condition worsens to point that she is lying at death's door.

So what is the heart of this film?  This movie is about the kind of woman a man wants and needs to love.  In that sense, this is a very unusual chick flick, because it really isn't about the woman's point of view or what she wants, although those elements are certainly present.  This is about a man who finds a woman that he needs to love, and needs to cherish, in order to become the man he is truly meant to be.

Charlotte truly sees Will for who he is.  He is a self-centered womanizer who, while not being a cruel man, is clearly only interested in his own self-fulfillment, particularly in the sexual arena.  Yet Charlotte sees something within Will that she responds to, and begins to change him, not by pressuring him, but by both challenging him and accepting him, both at once, yet each in its own distinct way.

Charlotte is innocent while wise, childlike while knowing, vulnerable yet smart and mature.  Yet Winona plays her so well that never once is any sort of inner conflict so much as hinted at.  Winona plays Charlotte such that Charlotte knows who she is and isn't afraid of her own vulnerability.  She is insightful, intuitive, and deliciously feminine.  Yet she confronts Will when she needs to do so, perhaps fearful of the outcome but never cowardly.  If there is something that needs to be said, she says it.  She never attacks, but confronts from a place of love.

Most men would give their right arm for a woman like Charlotte, so it is easy to see why Will falls for her so deeply.  She looks up at him with admiring eyes, and he responds to her, ""You look at me in a way that I haven't quite earned.""

Will is admitting that he is not everything that Charlotte believes that he is; clearly, and quite pathetically, he thinks it noble of himself to do so.  Without missing a beat, the playfully-demanding-yet-deeply-sincere Charlotte responds to him, ""So EARN it!""  And we, along with Will, instantly know that Charlotte sees the man that Will has it within himself to be.  The rest of the film is about Will becoming this man.  He heals his relationship with his estranged daughter, and takes responsibility for his identity and his choices.

Essentially this film is about the miraculous effects brought into a man's heart about by the love of a good woman.  Will must invest everything he is in trying to save Charlotte to finally be the man he was born to be.  IMHO, Charlotte is the woman most men want.  She never tries to get the upper hand with Will, yet her purity of heart is all she needs to demand, and receive, nothing but the best of who he is and what he has to offer.  Winona plays Charlotte as someone who has an innocent, true, pure heart.  Hers seems to be that rarest of hearts that the world can't quite seem to corrupt.  Her heart is bravely given to a man Charlotte knows has spent a lifetime pretending to be far less that what he actually is.  Charlotte is a treasure, and finding her changes Will forever.

The last scene of the film is of Will holding his infant grandchild, in the company of his once estranged, yet always devoted and loving, daughter.  The change is remarkable, and even though Charlotte has passed on and Will is in deep grief, he is a much more fulfilled, responsible, and open-hearted man.  He has become who he was meant to be, because his love for Charlotte has opened his inner heart.

I can't recommend this film too strongly.  The subplot of Will healing his broken relationship with his daughter is done to perfection, as is Will's occasionally contentious relationship with Charlotte's aunt.  Anthony LaPaglia, as Will's restaurant manager, is essentially Will's conscious, there to confront him with the fact that once he begins to love Charlotte, he will never be able to stop.

See this film, particularly if you are the romantic type.  Even if you are the masculine type, as I am, into ""Gladiator"", ""Rocky"",  and ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this movie will become one of your favorites, whether you want it to or not.

P.S.  Winona never looked better than she does in this film, but what of it?  Her beauty is icing on the cake ... as it always is where real love is concerned.",1183766400,4,5493,4.56704196519959

I found this to be extremely slow on early viewings, but on repeat viewings I've come to appreciate it more, and actually even like it- just.

More importantly, she has a rare heart disease and only has a little time left to live. I can see people rolling their eyes at how obvious the plot is, but it's actually a good movie. I think the message of the movie is you can't live on lust and sex alone, the character Will realized that he had a mental and emotional connection to Charlotte and would do anything to stay with her and keep her alive. He realized he could not live without her. There is some light comedy here and there, Ryder is charming in this role and Gere compliments her well. Also dealt with is Will's one time affair that led to a child, Lisa, which is acted out very well and doesn't seem clich at all, dealing with abandonment. A lot of people say that Gere and Ryder lack in chemistry, I think that's a good thing considering the age difference.

The negativity in the films release was that it was not released for ""pro"" critic's before it was released to the public. Meaning Mr. Ebert & Roeper ect. saw it when it was put out for public viewing and not before like they are used to. People continued to hear bad things about the movie, so it became a bad movie based on people's opinions. Most people 'of which' may not have even seen the movie for themselves. It's ashame because it's not a horrible movie like they say. Also the chemistry between RICHARD GERE & WINONA RYDER was o. k., they are nearly 25 years apart in age. How much  romantic chemistry would you expect them to have in their case? The film features some nice cinematography of New York in the fall season. The ""Twin Towers"" have a cameo appearance pre 9-11. It also has a likable soundtrack and supporting cast too. The over all look of the film is stylish. Nice work from director Joan Chen.

1275897,5,B00003CXL6,"I avoided this movie for about a year thinking... typical, until I watched it. The plot is somewhat similar to many movies that have been seen before. Guy meets girl and one of them doesn't have long to live. And what could possibly be said that hasn't been said before? Right?
Wrong. As I now know, it's not always that something has to be new, but new to the person watching it. Mainly on an emotional level. Take the movie ""Titanic"" for instance. There were many versions that came out on TV of it before the one with Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet came out. In fact I saw one strikingly similar that was four hours with Tim Curry in it that was viewed maybe a couple of months to a year before the feature film debuted.
The point is you will find a lot of movies that are alike and similar, but if they mean something different to each person then that's all that matters. I thought Autumn in New York was absolutely charming and couldn't be better. It touched my heart. Winona Ryder's character not having long to live and falling in love with Richard Gere's character who was twice her age and of course... subconsciouly we all expect an older person to die first. The underlying irony was gorgeous.
I think the critical viewers were missing the point... like I had been before I saw it. A typical movie doesn't mean it isn't unique. This one was unique in it's own fashion in how a young vibrant woman opened the heart of a womanizing man certain to not commit and leave every woman before they left him. It taught you about fear and what to do with love.
We could learn a lot from the movie considering love is the most important emotion that exists. Charlotte knew what to do with her love and was dying, and Richard Gere's character although living had no idea how to handle his life and how to even contribute to a life that required commitment to love. She taught him how to stop being afraid. His character was afraid to love and then lose. And the irony of his choice was also amazing--he could blow her off as he did every woman and still love her, but choose to lose her by ending it first or let himself love her and still lose her by not leaving first. But still either way he would lose her. But the most amazing thing is what he would gain while losing her... if he let himself.
I think sometimes we go in expecting all of the wrong things in a movie and criticizing it for not having it when we really need to take a closer look and we might actually see that it has exactly what we need. And maybe we're lacking in emotion... and could use some learning from it.
The movie had simiar plots to many movies--yes--but it didn't stop it from being really good and unique and having its own individual message.
Plus, I think some people still are stuck on ""Pretty Woman"" ... it's over guys... Richard Gere's past ""Pretty Woman""... he's moved on! Let him grow.
It just would be nice if we could all appreciate the right movies for once. Me included... I'm working on doing that! I learned something very important from this movie, but I could never describe what I learned. If you watch it maybe you'll learn something too.

I saw this movie on a day when I was depressed and ready to cry anyway, just a few months after a friend of mine, a young woman, living in New York, died from a heart problem.  I did not for a moment in this whole movie come close to crying.
You want an explanation for that?  I can give you several.  There's zero chemistry between Winona Ryder and Richard Gere, two actors who have in previous movies each shown themselves perfectly capable of providing one side of onscreen chemistry.  And yet, with each other, nothing.  Then I think that the whole genre of movies where an eccentric, unworldly, terminally ill person causes an overly worldly, hardhearted person to loosen up, have some fun, and learn to love has been just wee bit overdone.  This movie doesn't strike a single new note in that story.  Then, Richard Gere loosens up much more convincingly and effectively in Pretty Woman, and there all it takes is a hooker.  And why do seriously ill people always have to be eccentric and unworldly and nave-yet-wise-in-their-naivete?  Maybe some of them are, maybe it can even be filmed effectively, but in this movie it comes across as tired, forced whimsy, a poor substitute for anything that could be called depth.

1275901,1,B00003CXL6,"What a dreadful film! I bought a used copy (it was on sale) because I loved LOST SOULS (2001) and was curious to learn more of Winona Ryder's work.

AUTUMN IN NEW YORK was so predictable, wanting to be a LOVE STORY ""dying young"" tearjerker. Gere plays a shallow rich playboy (were the producers trying to recapture Gere's success in PRETTY WOMAN?). He meets Ryder, who, after all these years, is the ""real thing."" She's dying. Gere is scared and runs. She's hurt. He returns. He seeks a ""miracle cure."" She teaches him to love. Yada, yada.

I won't say whether Ryder survives. That's what the film builds up to -- but I didn't care.

I saw no chemistry between Gere and Ryder. The supporting cast were drab to awful (aside from Gere's daughter, who was not great, but okay).

I agree with other reviews that there's something creepy, and missing, in this film.

I think it's the artificiality. The film looks like a wine commercial. Lots of scenes of the characters' ""picture perfect"" life, shot in low-light and soft-focus, glowing warmth, smiling warm friends, clinking glasses, oh-so-adorable children to whom noble Ryder reads magical fairy tales, the obligatory playing with food in the super-expensive kitchen which leads to love-making.

Ryder's warmth and laughter seem faked. Gere's crying seems faked. Everything -- dialogue, sets, acting -- seems faked and artificial.

On the other hand, YOU'VE GOT MAIL is a highly entertaining romantic film, despite the predictable story, because of the strong chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, and because the sacharine is not so heavy-handed and artificial. It feels ""real"" despite the story-book tale, and some ""wine commerical"" scenes.

But AUTUMN IN NEW YORK is dreadful. Heavy-handed and artificial and just awful.",1020988800,10,1776,5.037542662116041

1275964,2,B00003CXL6,"Autumn in New York is an odd movie. Something's missing. Think of a situation in which a good book is published with a couple of chapters accidentally left out. The movie has a lot of interesting things going on in it, but they somehow do not add up to a complete whole. It looks like the writer and/or the editor forgot parts of it. The result is a picture that almost works.
The story is a romance about a man of nearly fifty who meets a girl young enough to be his daughter. The attraction is mutual, and a love affair results. The characters have their problems. He is a womanizer who can't commit, and she is suffering from a potentially fatal heart condition. Both seem to have met the person of their dreams too late.
As the couple, Richard Gere and Wynona Ryder, both fine actors, are almost, but not quite, right. I am not talking about the age difference, for May to December romances have always been around. It's their chemistry as a twosome that is off. It's all glowing embers and no sparks. They are decidedly watchable. Mr. Gere is aging well, and I don't think Ms. Ryder has ever been more beautiful, reminding one of Aubrey Hepburn without the magical, wispy voice. Still, it takes a bit of fireworks to draw the audience in, and so we don't ever entirely connect with the pair.
This is director Joan Chen's second effort. You may remember her as Josie in the eccentric TV series, Twin Peaks. Her first movie was the magnificent but deeply depressing Chinese film Xiu Xiu the Sent-down Girl. Here, Chen is working with relatively lighter material. She is hampered by Allison Burnett's seemingly incomplete script, but her talent is obvious. If nothing else, Autumn in New York is one of the handsomest movies released last year. There is an elegance to it that is missing from almost every picture made these days. I am certain we will see great work from Chen in the coming years.
I will not spoil the plot for you, but I must warn you that the ending is one of the movie's parts where something seems to be missing. I suspect that when the finished product was first screened at the studio, some of those who were present must have called for a new ending.

Richard Gere plays a 48 year old New York restauranter who has had many women but has never experienced true love. Enter Winona Ryder, a 22 year old charmer.  At first I didn't think the chemistry was there between these two primarily due to the age difference, but as the film progressed their relationship began to work.  The movie doesn't break any new ground but it handles a familiar storyline very well. The movie spends considerable time on the development of the relationship between the two.  They fall hopelessly in love.  But there is a dark problem. The young woman has a serious ailment: a neuroblastoma (a form of tumor) growing in close proximity to her heart and the prognosis is not good.  When her health begins to deteriorate rapidly, the man seeks medical counsel and is told there is little that can be done. However, a famous surgeon is located and he attempts to excise the tumor.  He is not successful and the young woman expires during surgery. When this movie was in theatrical release I bet there wasn't a dry eye in the house.

It is a believable story, but the medical condition described, leaves little for the audience to hope for.  The end seems inevitable, which leaves the characters to only enjoy the here and now.  Which seems to be the entire point of this film anyways.

Richard Gere and Winona Ryder work well together on the screen (though I have to say I've never been a big fan of Ryder's). But this story of a doomed love affair just had such a been-there-done-that feel about it from beginning to end that one could only wonder why the filmmakers didn't opt for some surprise twist in the old chestnut.

I've never disagreed so strongly with seemingly widespread opinion like this before (not with it being negative and me being positive anyway), but I do disagree.  With just about every criticism levelled at this wonderful film, which ended up being one of my favorites of 2000.  I thought all of it - the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the story - everything about this film, was excellent.  The unfairness of the frequent personal attacks aside (like against Richard Gere, or Allison Burnett, or any of the other talent involved in this film), I think the majority of complaints about this film are just mass negative-bandwagon jumping (and maybe some sort of Hollywood political idiocy).  I'm a guy, and I normally don't like ""chick flicks"" at all, but I loved this one, and it was the first one I remember that got to me emotionally since ""Terms of Endearment"" back in 1983.  It works in spades.  If you haven't seen it yet, go into it with an open mind and don't let what seems to be mass opinion sway you before the initial credits roll.  Judging from my own personal experience and acquaintances, there are plenty of folks that adore this film, they're just not as vocal.
If I have any complaint about the film at all, it's with the editing mangling that MGM enforced on the film just prior to its semi-troubled release.  It's quite readily apparent, even to the untrained eye.  I sincerely wish I could one day see this movie as it was intended, via some Director's Cut release or such, even if I know that's not likely at this point.  In any case, the cutting room antics have detracted somewhat from this great film, but certainly not enough to make it a bad one.
To Ms. Chen, Ms. Burnett, Mr. Gere, Ms. Ryder, and the rest of this film's fine talent: thank you.  Some of us really did get it.  To the rest: see it if you haven't, and judge it on its own merits.  It's extremely and unfairly underrated.",1005350400,44,2052,4.55858310626703

1276057,2,B00003CXL6,"`Autumn in New York' is strictly for the masochists among us who have been yearning these past 30 years for a tedious May/December update of `Love Story.' The theme of this film seems to be that there is nothing like a romantic fling with a beautiful-but-tragically-doomed young heroine to turn an unprincipled womanizer into a Man of Virtue.
Winona Ryder plays a 22-year old woman, dying of a rare heart condition, who starts up an affair with a 48-year old restaurateur played by Richard Gere (it would appear that the filmmakers have seen fit to shave a few years off both their ages). The film deals with the absurdity of Gere's seemingly ageless, Dorian Gray-like good looks (a fact moviegoers have been noting for years) in rather an ingenious way. Rather than ignoring them, it brings them center stage, to the point where it seems like virtually every man, woman and child at some point or other sees fit to remark on them. This happens so often that the film begins to take on the air of a vanity production designed for the actor's own personal benefit.
Even as a tearjerker this film isn't very effective. Neither Ryder nor Geer are particularly likable in these roles. In their first scenes, especially, both characters seem way too cloying and coy to engage the audience's sympathy. Without that initial foundation so crucial in a romantic film, we watch the drama unfold more as dispassionate observers than fully engaged participants - a death knell for any film of this type. Geer's Will Keane is not only impossibly good looking but his position as a bon vivant of the Manhattan social scene - he even has his picture adorning the cover of New York Magazine - hurtles him into that rarefied atmosphere which makes audience empathy impossible. We don't believe for a minute that he is the cad he is supposed to be in the earlier part of the film - and we find his transformation to doting lover equally incredible. As the dying heroine, Charlotte Fielding is so bland and uninteresting that she finally makes Ali MacGraw look like the Harvard student she was meant to be in the earlier film but could never convince us she was.
Three-handkerchief weepies have never exactly been my cup of tea, but even diehard fans of the genre are likely to find both their tear ducts and their tissues distressingly dry at the end of this film.",995587200,3,2346,4.7104622871046224

They took the safe route between the Gere and Ryder characters instead of going for something with more bite. Perhaps that was their intention all along, but it seemed like they had the material in place during the first half for something different. A commentary track on the DVD might have shed some light on things, but they didn't include one. They didn't include any extras at all.

1276059,1,B00003CXL6,"I will be very very honest. I absolutely love Joan Chen and Winona Ryder, and I despise Mr.busybody,meddler,Gere with equal passion.
With the truth out of the way, the main reason I purchase this DVD is beacause of the two ladies mentioned. Sadly speaking, the only saving grace for this movie is the wonderful cinematography of New York in autumn. As for the script, I just shake my head solemnly throughout the entire movie.  As far as the DVD goes,  quality is pretty good, the scenes are sharp and the audio is clear. While I always am intrigued by the idea of relationships between young women and older men. This movie is too pretentious with tiresome melodramatic script and even a sad, terminally ill Wynona couldn't help to pull this movie out of the pit.
If you wanna see good movies by Wynona Ryder, one came to mind. ""Girl interrupted"" is excellent. If you wanna see gorgeous direction of Joan Chen, ""Xiu Xiu, the sent down girl"" is truly excellent and it depict a far more better, heartbreaking relationship of a younger girl with an older man.  For those who enjoy the hypocritical Richard's never ending parade of his Armani suits collections and GQ poses, then perhaps you might enjoy this movie.
Comparatively, with ""Autumn in New York"", I will much prefer  ""Sleepless in Seattle"" & 'You've got mail"" anytime, which is much more fun, and also, portray a charming New York.

1276060,2,B00003CXL6,"That's the question I ask myself every time I watch yet another disappointing Richard Gere vehicle.  I have followed Gere's career since his breakout role in Terence Malick's brilliant ""Days of Heaven"", and nothing he's done since has fufilled the early promise he displayed in that film.  It seems time and again the Movie Gods smile on him with a great role, which he immediately follows up with a piece of steaming celluloid ka-ka.  After giving a gutsy performance in one of the defining films of the '80s, 'An Officer and a Gentleman', Gere followed that up with fluff-pieces like 'American Gigolo', 'No Mercy' and 'Breathless', in which he had little to do other than exploit his looks and his bad-boy persona.  The occasional attempt to break out of this stereotype and display some actual acting chops('Yanks', 'King David') still appeared unfocused and scattershot.
Then Gere discoved the Tao, vegetarianism and Cindy Crawford, and seemed to enjoy a career renaissance of sorts to go along with his newfound inner balance. 'Pretty Woman' put him on the A-list of romantic leading men and ushered in Act II of Richard Gere as Sex Symbol. He gave a heartbreaking, Oscar-worthy performance opposite Jodie Foster in 'Sommersby', and was evil personified as the rogue cop in 'Internal Affairs', a brave gamble that displayed that yes, the man can indeed play against type when he chooses to.  Unfortunately, the the same time period was also marred by missteps ('Final Analysis'; 'Intersection')--that found him lapsing into his comfortable glib bad-boy persona again, only this time around, on a mature Gere, it sits even less well than it used to.  Recent attempts to recapture the romantic comedy-hero magic of PW--'First Knight', 'Runaway Bride'--fall flat.  Those movies are appealing enough, if one can look past the detail that Richard is getting a little long in the tooth for these parts and more or less appears to be sleepwalking through them.  Of late, the most intriguing bit of a Richard Gere picture is the Hair--will it be brown or silver or somewhere in between?  Shortish or Beethoven long?  And that's a pretty sad commentary on the quality of his performances.
Which brings us to 'Autumn in New York', which I would call the nadir of Richard Gere's career except that I haven't yet seen 'Dr. T and the Women'.  I'm saddened by what seems to be the undeniable conclusion--Richard Gere has the stuff to have become one of the finest American actors of his generation but time and again he has sacrificed his talent on the altar of Hollywood commercialism.  Despite his tireless off-screen activism promoting spiritual values, it seems like a totally different Gere, a much shallower one, that makes his movies.  His personal life seems to be in no way informing the choices he makes in his work, and I would have expected better from such a vocal proponent of spirtual balance as he has been.
It could be that Mr. Gere is sincerely conflicted about his dual role as Movie Star and World's Second-Most Famous Buddhist, and not surprisingly is finding the two mutally incompatible.  It would be better in that case to gracefully withdraw from the Hollywood limelight as his fellow activist Robert Redford has done, rather than involve himself in such low-brow projects as his most recent cinematic ventures.  His presence in movies like 'Autumn in New York' doesn't elevate the material as one would think.  In less high-profile hands, the movies mightn't be bad at all.  But Gere is capable of much better, so the movies appear that much worse by comparison.  Let's hope he rediscovers his passion for acting, and soon.  Otherwise he'd better retire to that mountaintop in Tibet and spare us any more painful excercises in futility like these.
I give this film 2 stars for the lovely exterior shots of New York and the always pixie-ish charm of Winona Ryder.  Mr. Gere gets no stars for recycling his same tired ladies-man schtick again.  If you want a feel-good valentine New York, watch 'Harry Met Sally' or almost anything of Woody Allen's instead.",991353600,5,4072,4.932650073206442

1276163,5,B00003CXL6,"Autumn in New York, in my opinion, was a great movie because it made a selfish man realize that a person can end up alone. Will is your typical 48 year old man that owns a successful resturant. He has a flaw that stands out which is that he is a womanizer. You have Charlotte who is a 22 year old free spirit who acts every bit like she has not grown up from being a child.
It seems like their personalities would clash, and some would say that they do, but I say that they don't. After the one night stand, Will tells Charlotte that he does not want to hurt her, and what they did was just a ""fling"". Charlotte ,on the other hand, reveals to him that is what she was looking for, too, but a little bit more. She tells him that she is ill, and that since she does not have long to live that they should give each other a chance because Will does not have to worry about becoming attach.
One night, Will, has a one night stand with his ex-girlfriend, and the scene is so powerful when Charlotte finds out what he has done.
Chen and the way she puts the scenery together does make Autumn in New York beautiful. The colors of nature and the colors of that the people wear interwined beatuifully, and so, those Will and Charlotte's love. Will finally gets why it is so important to love because love those hurt.

There is no real chemistry between Ryder and Gere, but that is the whole point. Under normal circumstances this relationship would never have happened. BUT THE SITUATION OF THIS RELATIONSHIP IS NOT NORMAL. Yes, the movie is  really slow, but this is not a movie with a typical plot, climax, and conclusion. We are dealing with a very young woman's last moments. (Her last autumn, her last Halloween, the last time she'll see the autumn leaves, the last snow she'll see, her last Christmas, the last time she will ice skate, etc.) These are NOT moments to be quickly glossed over; rather they should be savored. Even though her character may appear happy, we should feel some sorrow knowing that she will never experience these things again. One person made a valid point by saying, we should watch for the change in colors, the flow of the autumn leaves,  the seemingly unimportant noises like the rain drops,  the flight of the birds, and the falling of the snow. This is not really the drum I march to, but I will say this is one movie you should  watch at least once.",988848000,3,1347,4.670886075949367
1276165,5,B00003CXL6,"I watched ""Autumn In New York"" for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and the movie is still as fresh in my mind as if I just watched it. It's about a 48 year-old resturant owner from Manhattan named Will Keane(played by Richard Gere.) People consider Will as a love them and leave them playboy who has seducing women down to an art. That's until he meets 22 year-old Charlotte Fielding(played by Winona Ryder.) Charlotte is like nothing Will has ever seen before, and after a one-nightstand their relationship soon turns into something beautiful, but the old saying is good thing's never do last. In Will and Charlotte's case that may be true, because Charlotte has a heart condition. Will does everything in his power to try and hold on to the only woman he has ever truly loved. I recommend this movie to anyone who believes that the human heart can and does change, and that age doesn't stand a chance against matters of the human heart.",987984000,8,944,4.5588235294117645
1276166,1,B00003CXL6,"I should have known back in August when critics weren't even allowed to review the film; I should have known when the shear mention of the film caused friends to shudder. I should have known that when my best friend fell asleep during it in the theater that this one was not a winner; I REALLY should have known that when I already saw twenty copies pulled off the shelf with a 9.99 price tag on them that I was in for a stinker, but I've never really agreed with critics before and having been a fan of Richard Gere since ""Pretty Woman"" I thought I should give it a chance. I want my four bucks back.
Some people JUST don't have chemistry. I've seen Pretty Woman probably about 5,000 times and cry everytime I watch it; here you have a movie with a woman dying and I can't even shed a tear. Everytime Richard and Winona looked at each other I felt bugs crawling up and down my body and I've never felt like that during any romantic movie. I kept watching, I was giving it a chance. No matter how great an actor is, you can't save a bad script. THIS is the reason I don't watch soap operas. No amount of acting can save a movie from lines like ""Let me love you."" I felt like I had food poisening my stomach churrned so much. Not to mention that sex scene, I've never been more uncomfortable. You could just tell that it was not making love, it was two people forced to be kissing and rubbing up against each other. To quote what someone else had said, it was CREEPY! Not to mention the whole ""I love him even though he had a fling with my mother."" that just has Jerry Springer written ALL over it.
Now for the good points. Richard looked good, which isn't saying much, he always looks good. The chemistry between Will and his daughter was more touching then anything between him and Charlotte. Then there are the supporting actors I felt BAD for. Jill Hennessey whom I've adored since Law & Order and took my breath away for her protrayl as Jackie Kennedy, tried as best she could to make this movie work with the few scenes she had, but of course was unsuccessful. Elaine Stritch has many awards on her mantel, but not even that could save this garbage from being hauled to the landfil. Anthony Lapaglia has great one on ones with Richard, but even I could tell he didn't want to be there. Sherry Stringfield left ""E/R"" so she could move to New York and spend time with her boyfriend, so we know she isn't known for her good career moves.
When I first saw the trailer the movie looked good, the trailer made me cry, but then again the trailer was only a minute and a half long, not an hour and fourty four minutes of shear agony.
I never thought I'd ever write a bad review for a movie; there are many I did not like but my two cents really doesn't matter, but this one just should have never been made. But for the record, I will always love Richard, no matter what stinkers he made.",983750400,14,2885,4.247272727272727
1276167,2,B00003CXL6,"First off I am a huge Richard Gere and Winona Ryder fan, so eagerly anticipated this flick despite the vast criticism it endured (what do critics know?? listen only to me...)but felt ultimately let down by this film.
Gere and Ryder just don't have any chemistry together. Plus, my beloved Gere is aging fast, and it was kind of hard to believe that Charlotte would dig him for his body. Characters repeatedly refer to how good looking Gere is, and his way with women. Huh? Pretty Woman era Gere, yes, but this Gere? He seems thin, and his hair is too long.
But I digress. The story is shockingly uninvolving, and Charlotte's character in particular is just hard to believe. Most laughable moment: Charlotte says out of the blue, ""I can SMELL the rain"".....
The film never managed to really affect me, I felt that their romance never got off the ground. It is hard to see why Gere cares so much for the Ryder character.
The Grandmother is the most intriguing character in the film, and we never get to know about her. Also, things seem completely unresolved between Ryder and her Grandmother. She basically ditches her Grandma to spend her last days with Gere. Mysterious.
The beads were a very corny overdone touch, as was the ice skating incident. And Charlotte collapses too darn often.
My favorite element of the film was when Gere, a marvelous VEGETARIAN in real life-you go Gere! prepares a meatless feast for Charlotte and his friends. A great plug.
I am saddened to so thoroughly diss this misfire, but diss I must.",983145600,2,1522,4.661710037174721

1276169,3,B00003CXL6,"I didn't think there were any chemistry between Wiona Ryder and Richard Gere. They didn't seem to really be madly in love with each other or with New York. There were more sparkle between Gere's best friend and him than there were between the lovebirds themselves. And Gere was horrible in this movie. I don't think he was even acting!
However, I must say this is a girlie flick, so guys you were warned here. If you want to go out with the guys, rent this movie for your sweetie, buy a box of kleenex and hightail out of the house. She'll appreciate you not seeing her cry ~~ whether because of the mediocre acting or because of the poetry mentioned in the movie. It is a good movie to watch just once then you know that it wasn't meant to be.
I really miss Julia Roberts in times like this! I think Gere shouldn't be paired up with anyone else. Ryder needs to gain weight and take more acting lessons. She was so much better in Heathers or some of the other Gen-X movies. They didn't clash, but they weren't right for each other.
What a shame ~~ the story was romantic.",981763200,3,1071,4.280788177339901
1276170,5,B00003CXL6,"Two attractive people living familiar lives in unremarkable parts of New York City endure, what can also be familiar there, a rain-soaked autumn. Out of such plain stuff is spun an opera for the eyes, a parable in the language of color, a cinematic poem sparing in words, rapturous and beautiful.
It is oriental art delightfully beyond us. In six voices -- painting, ballet, drama, music, poetry, and silence -- it tells one story and illuminates another, yet it is as indifferent to our discovering its humble philosophy as nature is.
Even these hints may be telling too much:
View ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" first. ""Autumn in New York"" is contained by something universal at the heart of that film and the short novel it was based on.
Look at the screen as you would a painting, there are messages there. Notice colors in relation to the progress of the season and in relation to characters -- the colors they wear, but also the colors that share the screen with them.
Allow that walking can be dance, if expressive enough, likewise just a  gesture of the arm. Allow the oriental view that the hands are the center of dance. This is a ballet hidden in a drama. Try to pick up the threads of its movement and gesture, and follow. Understand what is expressed in dance alone.
Turn the volume up plenty to mask ambient noise. At the crisis of vital scenes there is a deep silence, one that gifts us with cat's ears: in that vivid wakefulness there are noises beyond music.
One fortunate enough to come under the spell of this beautiful work leaves a little  wiser to color's meanings, a little more a fan of the ballet that is hidden in life's drama, a little more awake to silence, and a little more ambitious for what movies ought to be.",980208000,3,1736,4.560897435897436

It only made it to the cinema because Gere and Ryder were in it. Put two lesser known actors in it and it would have got no where. I think the problem was that I just didn't care about he characters or what happened to them. He is a ruthless womaniser and she is a fool for falling for him. Don't bother, unless you are a Gere or Ryder fan. To make the viewer care and empathise is the aim of the director in a love story. It didn't happen for me and I was glad when it was over. Not my taste at all.",979257600,3,627,3.6865671641791047
1276172,4,B00003CXL6,"There is a lot to hate about this film, most of it unjustified.  This film has been a lightning rod for venomous criticism, but despite its unpopularity, it is a good film.  The reasons it put people off follow.  First, it is a tearjerker and those are decidedly out of style.  Today's audiences don't seem to have much tolerance for dying characters unless they are being blown up in an action flick, hacked up in a horror flick, dying of some politically correct disease, or a member of an endangered species.  Second, both Winona Ryder and Richard Gere gave unaccustomed performances, quite different from any they had given before.  Since most audiences liked the way they were before, this change was an unpleasant shock.  Finally, the age difference was off-putting, making Gere seem much older and Ryder seem much younger than we are used to.
For all the blistering criticism leveled against this film, it is a well-crafted story about the changes that love can foster in people's lives.  Joan Chen's direction provides a sensitive look at the relationship between these star-crossed lovers, with some enchanting looks at New York City as the romantic backdrop.  Although her pacing is a bit slow, the portrayal of the relationship, and particularly the effect it was having on Will (Gere) is probing and delicately done.
This film is about transcendence, both for the characters and for the actors that portrayed them.  Each of the characters grew and changed during the film, while both of the actors expanded beyond their previous limitations.  I was delighted to see Winona Ryder break out of her dour, grave type and give a breezy and effervescent performance.  If you put all her previous appearances together you would not have seen as many smiles as you see in the first ten minutes of this film.  It seems that Ryder has always played overly serious and mature characters.  She went through her teens and twenties without ever having a chance to act like a kid.  As it turns out, this part reveals that she has much greater range than anyone originally thought she did.  I hope this is a preview of things to come as she makes an attractive romantic figure.
Richard Gere also continues a transformation of his image with this film.  He started down this path in ""Runaway Bride"" with Julia Roberts, playing a more insecure male lead than his normal macho portrayal.  In this film, he actually becomes introspective and tortured, which is very unfamiliar territory for him.  Despite the fact that his fans are probably retching, this role represents a very courageous attempt on his part to move out of type and expand as an actor.  He does a wonderful job, giving a mature and complex performance that I didn't think he had in him.
This is not a great film, but it is a good one.  I rated it a 7/10.  I believe it is particularly important as a redefining moment in the careers of two excellent actors, which has broadened their reach and deepened their skills.  Not every film is about whether the audience likes it, although I did.  It is good drama, which goes beyond the schmaltzy romance to reveal the deep inner workings of the human heart during tragedy and adversity.  In that regard, it is a success.",979171200,17,3224,4.755395683453237

7917602,4,B00003CXL6,"It's 2018 and there has been some serious lack of romantic movies in the recent years.  No one seems to be sad about it though with all the Marvel movies occupying the silver screens and all.  So, I thought I'd go back in time and watch a romantic movie that I'd heard of but never got around to watching.  The trailer looked awesome and the movie wasn't bad at all.

The plot is predictable.  But, most romantic movies are predictable and you don't watch a romance movie for twist and turns of a plot.  You watch it to watch the romance blossom and the chemistry and how the movie makes you daydream of ideal romance that is not really true in real life.  (But may be partly true).

The chemistry between the two main actors is beautiful and they have chosen an appropriate actor to play the ""older"" man.  If you're gonna have an affair with an older man, it has to be convincing enough and who is more convincing than Richard Gere?  Who wouldn't want to have an affair with him.  And Wynona Ryder also holds her own as the younger lover who sweeps this wealthy man off of his feet.  She is innocent and sweet yet has enough charm to be believable in winning Gere's heart.

I thought the beginning of the movie was great and then the plot kinda slowed down a little, but the chemistry between the two actors kept me watching.  I wish there was a more distinct arch to the characters and may be show off Autumn in New York a little bit more cuz I don't think they did that enough - may be I had too high of an expectation given the title of the movie.

I don't know if I'd recommend it to people but it satisfied my romance movie itch...so 3.5 stars from me.",1522454400,2,1658,4.235668789808917
