3836683,5,B0021L8UL2,"This film is a pastiche of several short films about love in its various incarnations in NYC. If this premise sounds familiar that's because it's produced by the same people as Paris, Je T'Aime. New York, I Love You has more A-List clout (James Caan, Orlando Bloom, Shia LeBouf, Christina Ricci, Ethan Hawk, Natalie Portman, Andy Garcia, Bradley Cooper, and many more) and the short films interweave much more fluidly than its Parisian predecessor. It's a magical movie experience with a lot of humor, a lot of heart, and a slight wisp of sadness thrown in for good measure (no such thing as love without sorrow to some degree). Bottom line is you don't have to love New York in order to love this film--but it doesn't hurt.",1265500800,8,724,4.6640625
3836684,3,B0021L8UL2,"""New York, I Love You"" is, of course, the Big Apple version of ""Paris, Jet'aime"" -- both anthology films involving a series of love stories set in their respective big cities. There, alas, the comparison ends. The earlier film was livelier, zestier, more colorful, and had more ambition going for it. Everyone involved seemed bent on telling the smartest, wittiest, classiest story they could in five or ten minutes. The sections directed by the Coen Brothers, Tom Twyker and Alexander Payne brought out the best in everyone. (Payne's was a small masterpiece.) This ""New York"" thing, by contrast, is mostly just amusingly clever. There's some good stuff here, admittedly. The best segment is one by Brett Ratner, involving a luckless young man who gets a prom night neither he nor I will ever forget. Also, it was great to see Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman paired off as a bickering but loving old couple. It's always great to see Julie Christie again, too, although her segment didn't amount to much, and neither did a lot of the others. I think the script for Natalie Portman's contribution was probably written on a napkin the day before shooting. You could do worse if you're looking for a movie for Valentine's Day but, as I've noted repeatedly, you could also do a lot better.",1265241600,3,1284,4.8144796380090495
3836685,5,B0021L8UL2,"""New York, I Love You"" is quite an ambitious project. It represents part of what is referred to as the ""Cities of Love"" series, which was started by the successful ""Paris, je t'aime"" (2006). Like its predecessor, ""New York, I Love You"" tries to capture love in all its facets, provided by the vision of several directors, resulting in a charming and touching film.

The stories, as its name implies, take place in New York City, of which we see some of its scenery, but it could have really taken place anywhere else. They feel like universal stories and each one embodies the particular vision of its director, which included Yvan Attal, Allen Hughes, Shunji Awai, Wen Jiang, Mira Nair, Joshua Marston, Brett Ratner, Natalie Portman (her directorial debut), Shekhar Kapur, Fatih Akin, and Randall Balsmeyer. Kapur's segment was originally slated to be directed by Anthony Minghella, who passed away just before the filming began. Two segments, directed by Scarlett Johansson and Andrey Zvyagintsev, were not included in the final version of the film, but are added as extras on the Blu-ray release.

Mixing ten to eleven stories in one movie means that each one has to be short in time, and that is precisely what we get in ""New York, I Love You."" There is a story about a Jewish lady that is getting married to a Jewish man, but is attracted to the man of Indian descent (he is also to her) who sold her the nuptial ring. This is my favorite segment of the film. There is also the story about a thief that unknowingly steals from the girlfriend of another thief, just to gain her affection. Then, there is a segment about a pick-up artist that meets his match. Another favorite is the one in which a pharmacist convinces a young man to take his daughter to the prom. Unbeknown to the young man, the girl happens to be handicapped. Although each story is different, some of them are somewhat connected with the same characters, but most of them are not. However, continuity is not really an important factor here. It's all about different kinds of love in the big city.

""New York, I Love You"" has an impressive cast - old and new Hollywood -- that includes Natalie Portman, Andy Carcia, Bradley Cooper, James Caan, Ethan Hawke, Julie Christie, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Christina Ricci, Robin Wright Penn, Chris Cooper, Rachel Bilson, Eli Wallach, Cloris Leachman, John Hurt, and many more. The music and the cinematography are also impressive, and really enhance the stories. Can't wait to see the next installment of this very interesting series. The BLU-RAY includes interviews with director, Brett Ratner, Mira Nair, Yvan Attal, Josh Marston, and Shunji Iwai; the two additional segments not included in the film; and the theatrical trailer.

3836686,3,B0021L8UL2,"This isn't really a movie in the traditional sense, but a series of short films with a few common threads to intertwine the huge ensemble cast. With multiple directors and a slew of talent, it seems like a huge collaborative effort from actors and film makers who have a serious passion for New York. Of course, the common theme is love, and while it's about love at all stages -- with strangers, new couples, father and daughter, to the pair who's been together for 50 years, you can also see it's a love letter to the city of New York. Each director is showing you how they see the city. Surprise, intrigue, normalcy and tradition.

The city to me is a place where you constantly see, pass, interact with people, yet you never really seem to know anyone and can feel like you're in your own bubble. With everyone, yet alone. You may have random connections with complete strangers every now and then that leave an indelible mark on your soul. That is actually how I felt about this film. I'll always remember it as a true vision of New York City, because they showed me all the facets that can be found there.

While interesting and visually impressive, it wasn't thrilling and there were a few sections of it that I wanted to fast forward thru. New York, I love you, isn't a movie I'll want to revisit.  Plus, unlike a few other ensemble movies(Love, Actually comes to mind), you never really get to know any of the characters besides what they're emitting at that moment. You may speculate to your heart's content, and that might excite you. But for me, I wanted to know more.

I did not really pay much attention to Ms Portman in Star Wars; she caught my attention in V for Vendetta, and of course she deserved the Oscar for Best Actress in Black Swan.  I enjoyed every vignette: to me they were all excellent, some poignant, some with a surprise ending, and some laugh out loud hilarious. I enjoyed the varied cast of great actors.

And his piece about being the dad (mistaken for a ""manny"") to a little girl who was completely in love with life, and her dad, was so uplifting (Carlos even performs a segment of a modern ballet)!

The short films are all VERY loosely (barely) tied together, and feature the strength of some very good actors like Bradley Cooper, Natalie Portman, Orlando Bloom, Christina Ricci, Olivia Thirlby, Anton Yelchin, James Caan, Hayden Christensen, Ethan Hawke, Andy Garcia, Julie Christie, Shia LaBeouf, John Hurt, Cloris Leachman, Robin Wright, Rachel Bilson, Chris Cooper and more.  The films themselves range from just okay to poignant ... but when they're good they are VERY good, particularly in the case of the Christie/Hurt/LaBeouf short, which weeks later still sticks with me emotionally (this one short film contains probably the sweetest, most touching and real performance of LaBeouf's career, so far).  Quirky, sometimes funny, sometimes a bit odd, altogether the films did leave me with the same sense of left-of-center beauty New York itself has always given me - and even though ten films in 103 minutes doesn't leave a lot of room for character or plot development, for this sense of NYC alone (along with the small bunch of shorts here that really stand out from the crowd) 'New York, I Love You' is time well spent for anyone who loves the city ... or finds it fascinating, just the same.",1374883200,,1476,4.919678714859438

Director Mira Nair assembled 10 different directors who each shot a sort of short story about love lost and found in a city that never sleeps.  In this film characters come from all cultures and races and even if they meet for a brief moment, they leave lasting impression on each other.  Each story is independent but also each one complements the others.  Many of th actors are carefully chosen and I say they all perfectly fit their roles.

To me personally, the most powerful story is the story with Julie Christie and Shea LaBeouf.  It is surreal compared from all others which in my opinion made is stand out in a good way.

Some of the dialogue is fast paced and witty, while other is more reflective and quiet.  In any case, it is uniquely New York City type of movie with characters and situations that are believable and at times heartbreaking.  Lovely movie, but seemingly not for general audiences.

The movie strings together a dozen or so vignettes in which random couples meet and share a few significant moments together - all against the backdrop of a city steeped in vibrancy, color and romance.

As is to be expected with this type of film, the episodes themselves vary somewhat in quality and interest, but with no real standout amongst them.  My favorite, if I had to choose, would probably be a charmer about a virginal teen who winds up taking a wheelchair-bound date to the prom.  The actors aren't given much of a chance to develop their characters, though, interestingly, the best performance (by the perpetually elegant Julie Christie) and the worst performance (by the mannered Shia LaBeouf) are to be found in the same segment.

Of course, this is a largely upscale view of the city - predominantly white, gentrified and problem-free - that never gets north of the Park in its geography.

By contrast, the New York film is comprised of 11 longer pieces of approximately 10 minutes apiece.

3837382,5,B0021L8UL2,"In 2004 I watched -- and immediately went out to buy -- ""Love Actually"", which is set in London.  The premise of these films is simple: several love stories, at different stages, all set in the same world-famous city, many interwoven with each other.  For anyone unfamiliar with proper filmmaking, short films are always the entree for film students and others wanting to catch their lightning in a jar.  For big-time directors like Brett Ratner of Rush Hour fame, it's an exacting exercise to encapsulate a completed idea into a very small space.  Each segment runs about 7 or 8 minutes, then segues into the next.  Last year I came across ""Paris Je'Taime"", which was another brilliant installment in this genre.  Major actors, major directors, major writers, and the up-and-coming as well.

""New York I Love You"" is the latest (and promised NOT to be the last, with a blurb about an upcoming ""Shanghai I Love You"" in the bonus features) in this series.  Some reviewers thought the movie had no through-composed theme or narrative, which only exposes their ignorance.  It's like saying the Bible has no through-composed theme or narrative.  Both are COLLECTIONS of stories anthologised into one piece of work.  ""New York I Love You"" is, to me, what pure non-Hollywood filmmaking is all about.  It's probably what film festivals SHOULD be about.  It also appeals to the younger generation who, beside being interested in their favourite stars appearing, will appreciate the brevity of the segments  (love stories for short attention spans).  It's stupid to compare this to a Woody Allen film simply because it's filmed in the Big Apple.

This film is highly recommended to anyone who likes love stories, who appreciates good acting and excellent directing/writing.  It's a mini-seminar in how to make wonderful, accessible art films.  I also highly recommend the other two movies mentioned in this review.  Its only flaw is that the editing/segueways between a few of the shorts is poor.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Actually-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)</a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paris-Je-T-Aime-Paris-I-Love-You/dp/B000UVV26A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paris, Je T'Aime (Paris, I Love You)</a>are stronger in this area.  All in all, it's still a near perfect movie, and each vignette features one of the most talked-about and oft-filmed co-stars of all time: the City of New York.

3837383,3,B0021L8UL2,"Perhaps I've been ruined by experiencing Paris, Je T'aime (the original film this was based off of) but this film did not seem to pop. Individually, the pieces of the entire film should add up to create a good film seeing as the acting was well done and the individual story lines were all quite unique. Even still, with all the little pieces separately, the movie was just ok. The one thing that has brought me back again and again to Paris, Je T'aime is the feeling of utter adoration for Paris every single time after watching that film. Every moment was filled out with an underlying and common love for their eternal city. At times in New York, I Love You, I almost forgot the city they were in or the ultimate purpose for making the film. It didn't leave me wanting to go to New York or thinking something spectacular of the city I know so well. It did not elevate New York as a home as Paris, Je T'aime did. So, perhaps if I hadn't seen Paris Je T'aime first, my opinion wouldn't be so strong but I have been tainted by brilliance that provoked the making of this film and unfortunately this film did not live up to its originator.",1274745600,,1138,4.322429906542056
3837384,3,B0021L8UL2,"A rather silly little film. It is in no way love for the city of New York which is hardly explored or presented, except as a hunting ground, but evanescent and transient love in New York. Nothing really regular, only accidental meeting and sexual exchanges that are more at the level of the word, not really courting but rather shocking in order to get the fastest and most comprehensive reaction that has to be sexual action. A couple of situations are funny, but never very kosher and that leads to a mutilated vision of New York with only Jews and Chinese. Rejection of the others and stigmatization of those shown. A film to avoid if possible or to see in order to learn the art of the caricature that means nothing.

3837436,3,B0021L8UL2,"If you go on IMDb for this film and take a look at the comments, there's an astounding amount of negativity towards this film. So I was prepared for the worst.

Yes, there are some weak moments.

And some segments are indulgent, they drag, they go nowhere.

But here's the thing: 'New York, I Love You' is not 'about' New York. If it was, I'm not sure that any film, or any cinematic effort could possibly do justice to what is, inarguably, one of the most amazing cities on earth. There's just too much there, too many contributing factors for any movie to properly pay tribute to New York City.

Further, the bits and pieces that make up the film are not 'stories' per se. They're snippets. Snapshots. Vignettes. Some are decidedly 'art house' fodder, while others... Others are lovely moments, almost perfect pieces of 'supporting evidence' for a particular viewpoint of the city.

My impression of New York, given the handful of times I've been there, is that it's *everything*.

But I say this without taking anything away from any other city. I say it because NYC holds within its hands the best and the worst, the gamut of grand accomplishment and folly's failure, the true scope of humanity...

...indeed, it contains such a length and breadth of us, of a global 'us' as to stagger. (Me, anyway.)

That is, if you're open to the notion of 'New York City' at all. And if you're not, then this film will probably not contain enough of much to satisfy you on any level. Because at its heart, 'New York, I Love You' is an indirect love letter, more about the words being used to express the sentiment than the sentiment itself.

There's wonder in this film. Delicate, fleeting, languorous helpings of wonder. The kind that makes you shake your head, the kind you hardly notice, the kind that moves you, swells your heart, makes you cry.

It is, at its core, impressionistic. And maybe this is why there's so much negativity projected towards it, because New York being what it is, and New Yorkers being what and how they are, I doubt that 'impressionistic' is the kind of approach most attached to the city long for, or would approve of.

Their loss.

Having said that, would I have executed an homage to the city in this way? No. Because I think the mix was off. For while NYC has its impressionistic elements, it's grounded in bedrock. Its history is 'populist'. Its day-to-day, for the most part, is 'populist'. So I would have taken a more structured approach to a film paean, something more digestible.

Nevertheless, 'New York, I Love You' is a nice postcard for someone who's already been there and really just needs something to remind them of the poignancy of memories residing within them about the place.

3837441,2,B0021L8UL2,"New York, I love you is not really a move but a quilt of different short films which attempt a common theme. It brings many characters to the movie but has no depth at all. Some big name directors contribute such as Yvan Attal, Allen Hughes, Shunji Awai, Wen Jiang, Mira Nair, Joshua Marston, Brett Ratner, Natalie Portman (her directorial debut), Shekhar Kapur, Fatih Akin, and Randall Balsmeyer along with many big names Natalie Portman, Andy Garcia, Bradley Cooper, James Caan, Ethan Hawke, Julie Christie, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Christina Ricci, Robin Wright Penn, Chris Cooper, Rachel Bilson, Eli Wallach, Cloris Leachman, John Hurt and Drea DeMatteo.
 I only watched this movie because I was curious of the premise which was, the directors chosen were given only 24 hours to shoot, a week to edit.

The best episode was directed by Joshua Marsten with Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, an old couple on their way for lunch in Coney Island. Their interaction and the love they show for each other after 63 years of marriage was perhaps the best scene in the movie or for that matter in recent movie memory.  If you are interested to see the result of having so many directors and actors contributing, watch this movie but don't expect any satisfaction from the story. I give it two and half stars. 2/27/10",1267315200,,1321,4.836283185840708
3837442,3,B0021L8UL2,"A dozen stories. Ten filmmakers. 103 minutes. If you do the math, you will draw the same conclusion I did - that there isn't much time for a viewer to make an emotional connection with every episode presented in this all-star 2009 omnibus tribute to New York. An eclectic group of global filmmakers, some well-known, others on the verge, had to meet certain requirements to make the final cut - they were given only 24 hours to shoot, a week to edit, and the result had to reflect a strong sense of a particular NYC neighborhood. The cumulative effect makes for a moody portrait of the city through various couplings, but due to the contrivance of its structure, the film falls short in bringing a deeper emotional resonance to the themes the creators want to convey.

With a couple of key exceptions, the film appears to be more of a valentine to Lower Manhattan. Consequently, there is a fashionably edgy look to the short stories. Israeli-born French director Yvan Attal epitomizes this feeling in two episodes. The first deals with an aggressively talkative writer (an irritating Ethan Hawke) throwing a barrage of romantic and sexual overtures at a sleek Asian woman who appears to have heard it all (Maggie Q). The other is marginally better, focusing on a chance conversation outside a restaurant between a woman taking a cigarette break (an effortlessly sexy Robin Wright Penn) and a man intrigued by her emotional availability (Chris Cooper). Both have O. Henry-type twist endings that make them ultimately entertaining.

A couple of other entries feel more gimmicky by comparison. Brett Ratner's mostly comic entry features Anton Yelchin as a nave high-school student and Olivia Thirlby as his unexpected prom date with James Caan as her pushy pharmacist father. Mira Nair directed a flat culture-clash encounter between two savvy souls - a Hassid woman about to marry (Natalie Portman) and a Jain diamond dealer (Irrfan Khan) - who become mutually intrigued by their price negotiation meeting. Other episodes feel even more cursory. Portman wrote and directed a brief episode focused on an ebullient toddler (Taylor Geare) and her father (Carlos Acosta) having a play date in Central Park, highlighted by a brief dance performance from Acosta at the end (he is a Cuban-born principal dancer for the Royal Ballet). Chinese director Jiang Wen led Hayden Christensen, Andy Garcia and Rachel Bilson on an empty roundelay of deception and humiliation among thieves at a bar.

Japanese director Shunji Iwai was at the helm of a slight episode featuring Orlando Bloom as a frantic musician working against deadline, while Turkish director Faith Akin shares a brief story of obsession with Uur Ycel as a solitary artist who wants to paint the face of a local Chinese herbalist (Shu Qi). The entry from Allen Hughes (of the Hughes Brothers) consists mostly of a continuing voiceover of two regretful lovers (Bradley Cooper, Drea de Matteo) hesitant to follow up on their passionate one-night stand. The oddest, most dispiriting entry comes from Shekhar Kapur who directed a script from the late Anthony Minghella (to whom the film is dedicated). It stars Julie Christie as a renowned opera singer returning to a posh Fifth Avenue hotel where she bonds with a palsied, Slovak-accented bellboy played by an overly sensitive Shia LaBeouf. The nature of their relationship is never really divulged, but it ends on a surreal note of little consequence.

Directed and written by Joshua Marston, the best episode is perhaps the least ambitious as it features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an aged, bickering couple on their way to the boardwalk in Coney Island for their 63rd anniversary. The reassuring way she places her head on his shoulder is easily the most touching moment in the film. All in all, this stylish hodgepodge will appeal mostly to those who are drawn to the short story format. Benot Debie's sharp cinematography at least brings a consistent sheen to the film as it tethers the various storylines to a New York that feels mired in a cinematic fantasy. I just think Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"" executes on the same approach far more effectively. The extras on the 2010 DVD include a handful of additional scenes (though not the two deleted segments directed by Scarlett Johansson and Andrei Zvyagintsev), interviews with five of the directors and the original theatrical trailer.",1266192000,16,4395,5.0246913580246915
