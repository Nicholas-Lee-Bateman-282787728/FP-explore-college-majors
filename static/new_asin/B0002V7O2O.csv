8032173,4,B0002V7O2O,"Proxy War (1973) is the third installment of Kinji Fukusaku's yakuza series Battles Without Honor & Humanity. In this installment Shozo Hirano (Bunta Sugawara) comes to the forefront as yakuza power plays come into play and implicate Hirano who is caught between a weasel-like colleague Uchimoto (Takeshi Kato) and the most recent boss Yamamori (Nobuo Kaneko). There is lots of violence that is chaotic and recorded by hand held camera to suggest realism. This series is concerned with the power play within and between the different yakuza families, but it seems that more about how they make their money would make for more entertaining films ala Goodfellas. A lot of the plot involves yakuza gathering for drinks or gambling and discussing changes in the hierarchy or getting attacked by a rival family. This one leaves you wondering what Hirano will do in the next installment since he has tried to be reasonable, but has been pushed into a corner.",1393372800,2,952,4.9937106918239
