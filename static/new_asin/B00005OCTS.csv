7948968,5,B00005OCTS,"It may be because I'm using a Region 0 player, but you can't turn off the subtitles or text commentaries on this DVD. You have to watch with one or the other. We buy Region 2 DVDs of British programmes because they're intact and never bowlderised. So always know where your towel is and don't forget to bang the rocks together, guys.",1404950400,,333,4.387096774193548
7948969,4,B00005OCTS,"This recording dates back to 1981, so don't expect outstanding modern special effects. Despite of the slightly old style of the filming the story is very amusing and is loyal to the original book from Douglas Adams. This DVD is worth buying both for its extremely funny and famous story as well as historic aspect showing the studio work of that era. Organization of this disc is good and the quality of filming and actor work is excellent. Guaranteed BBC quality.",1159142400,,464,4.7407407407407405
