8489749,5,B005ZLFDVA,"This is one of my favorite show and the british production is much more appealing then the american. Something in the editing, the flow of the story ,the brits are doing it the right way. The combination of detective stories with drama and comedy. Great way the get some history lessons. All in one.",1374537600,6,299,4.555555555555555
8489750,5,B005ZLFDVA,"Had to buy this, I already have EVERY episode of the US version.  Found out about the UK version by accident.  Love it want more if they have any.",1361577600,,146,4.0
8489751,5,B005ZLFDVA,"I thought the American version was good, this is just as good.  Seeing the history of these peoples lives is very interesting.",1354752000,2,126,4.7272727272727275
8489752,5,B005ZLFDVA,"I became acquainted with the BBC series thru youtube postings.  I did buy this PAL Reg. 2 set.  I do have a PAL DVD player.  This set is absolutely wonderful for anyone with an interest in genealogy.  I also tried the discs on my new computer - they played perfectly.  The one problem is that when you start watching them, it is difficult to stop!!!!",1331856000,5,350,4.323076923076923
8489753,4,B005ZLFDVA,"Despite the fact I don't know half the people profiled in this series I found it to be a really awesome show and well worth owning.  I've watched several of the episodes more than once. If you love exploring history this show really gives you that.  The only disappointment was that the disc of the first season doesn't have the Emmit Smith episode(I'm sure it's because they thought that the UK audiences wouldn't be interested). Just as an FYI you can get this cheaper buying it direct from Amazon UK.  It will take a lot longer to ship though, I think.  Also be sure that you have a device you can play this on since it's a Region 2 DVD. My laptop plays DVDs from more than one region so I was set but yours might not.",1329177600,5,721,4.240875912408759
