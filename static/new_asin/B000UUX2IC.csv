The case and the DVD title were both correct.  However, when the DVD was played it was actually ""Inventions:  The Technology of Warfare"". Unfortunately, this DVD was not viewed until recently even though it was purchased in April.  Too late to return.  I can't find any contact information for Amazon to let them know there may be problems with other copies of this DVD.",1353974400,,549,6.465753424657534
8215037,1,B000UUX2IC,"Poor video quality- seems like it was reproduced off of an old VHS!
I didn't expect the scholarship and presentation to be earthshaking or new but it was so basic and bland as to be nearly as underwhelming as the quality of the video. Wouldn't recommend this DVD at any price.",1294963200,2,276,4.431372549019608
8215038,1,B000UUX2IC,"I ordered ""The Middle Ages"" and the packaging and labeling of the DVD were correct. However, the actual contents of the dvd was ""Inventions; The Technology of Warfare"".",1285891200,,168,5.035714285714286
8215039,1,B000UUX2IC,"Very disappointing DVD.  It presents a bunch of ""talking heads"", boffins who are as dry as an Aussie summer.  I would not recommend it for junior high school students unless they were having trouble sleeping.",1277078400,2,208,4.914285714285715
8215040,1,B000UUX2IC,I am not sure if it was the three people speaking or the way the material was presented - but this is very dry and difficult to follow. I was looking for more facts and fewer comments from people who are difficult to understand. There is really no fluency to this movie. I was hoping for an overview of the Middle Ages.,1268179200,4,319,4.161290322580645
8215041,4,B000UUX2IC,"This video is a good overview of the Middle Ages.  It is a bit ""stuffy"" and does not have many ""bells and whistles"", but it gives good general information and would be best suited for secondary students.  It came in handy for a basic review and refresher of information for myself before diving into the topic with my students.",1254268800,10,327,4.52542372881356
8215042,5,B000UUX2IC,This show is actualy more truthful in our christian hating atheistic culture so as to not blame ones unhapiness and problems on the church. The truth is the orthodoxy church was the central force of helping the people in the mid and early middleages. Ignorant atheists intilectuals whos lives suck should at least learn about history before they choose one to blame there problems on.,1233187200,13,384,4.923076923076923
8215043,2,B000UUX2IC,"I had hoped that this survey of the Middle Ages would enlighten the novice to the immense and terrifying power exerted by the Church over every aspect of life, but it didn't really give much perspective on this.  Consequently it didn't serve my purposes well, and I found the commentators rather too sanguine about the Middle Ages, praising the tactical warfare of mounted knights (like adolescent boys) with  virtually nothing critical to say about the superstitious, anti-intellectual, patriarchal, sexist and oppressive aspects of those times.  One does better to watch The Name of the Rose.",1221955200,9,594,5.231578947368421
8215044,2,B000UUX2IC,"I reviewed this video for my 9th grade history class. I wanted an interesting overview of the middle ages. The Professors are so boring, slow, er, um,and grasp for words. Any medieval history professor I have met can discourse eloquently and fluently on the subject, but these three can't. Then they start discussing Charlemagne and his contributions. Well, the kids won't know who Charlemagne was, so this is totally backward! They need to get to the main point! Whoever produced this video is certainly not an educator. Save your money.",1111190400,7,538,4.988888888888889
