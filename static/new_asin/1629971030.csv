7800576,5,1629971030,"This is a high-quality course. The DVD has an instructor who really knows the subject, and it comes with a book. My son, who has high-functioning Autism uses it. So do my husband and I. I also want my parents to use it to help keep their brains active and hopefully protect against dementia and other types of memory loss. This is an interesting course with great material.

I received a discount to try this out and write a review.",1466899200,,432,4.4

I really enjoyed this series!!!This course takes us on a fascinating journey across the landscape of brain research and its influences on what we can do about making the most of our brain functions. I found this course interesting, informative and constantly surprising about what we can learn from the research. Dr Medina is an excellent lecturer. At first, I found his exuberance a little too energetic for a set of recorded lectures, but it grows on you after a while. Eventually, his style emerges as a welcome feature of this course. His enthusiasm for the subject matter cannot be denied, and he is very adept at making the science accessible to a generalist audience. His use of anecdotes, metaphors and images to help us develop an understanding of the workings of the brain is very effective. I found it hard to stop watching. Amazingly, too, there is a lot of practical advice in these lectures. The most complex object in the known universe is the human brain. We all have a basic conception of how our brains function, but do you truly understand the inner workings of your mind? In 24 exciting lectures, probe the origins of consciousness, memory, emotion, attention, intelligence, and more. Also, learn scientifically proven methods to improve your memory, boost your creativity, and keep your mind sharp.i did receive this at a discounted price for my honest and unbais review but this is an excellent purchase!!!!",1466899200,,1512,4.88715953307393
7800578,4,1629971030,"This is one course that is provided by a company that does multiple series on different topics.  As I work in the field of surgery, I am constantly fascinated by what our bodies do and how they work.  Having taken college courses on Anatomy and Physiology was one of my favorite subjects so I presumed this would be a slam dunk for me.  Several things to point out in my observations of this series include:
1) The professor doing the lectures may or may not get on your nerves.  He is older and uses many references to keep it entertaining; however, for those of us born post baby boom generation some of the references get lost.  His humor is not my style and at times I felt as if he was talking at me in lieu of to me.
2) The beginning of the lectures is spent going over what will be reviewed which is obviously part of the table of contents.  I would prefer a Q&A session and recap and what's next at the end versus one telling me at the beginning of what will be discussed right away.  To me, it is just time filler that I do not have nor need.
3) Overall, it is informational in an understanding of brain health and how to get the most from your brain.  It is not a medical or technical explanation on the neuroscience of the brain's physiology as I had hoped.

All this to say, if you are one that enjoys learning and self-help improvement courses, you may enjoy this and find the professor's humor and lectures entertaining. If you are looking for more of an medical/technical and scientific based series on the brain then this may not be what you are after.  Either way, it is educational and I was able to learn from it so overall in my book, it is worth it. I am thankful to have received this product at no cost in exchange for my unbiased and honest review which is based solely on my private experience.  Thanks!",1466467200,,1828,4.269565217391304
7800579,5,1629971030,"I received The Great Courses Your Best Brain and its very interesting.  While I have not yet gotten through all of it, its 12hr of lectures, I have gotten through a good chunk.  So far its been riveting to watch, allowing me to think of my brain and those of my family members a little differently.  I have really enjoyed watching a lecture and reading the guidebook to make sure I have picked up everything.  So far what I have found most interesting were the lectures on infants and adolescents, as I have 1 of each.  It is allowing me to understand my children a little better.  I really like this set comes with a paperback guidebook.  Im able to brush up on what Ive learned at a later date.  The DVDs are easy to watch and understand although an audio only option would be suitable and you could listen in your car.  This course will give anyone the comprehensive knowledge of the brain and how it works.

7800580,5,1629971030,This was so interesting. There was so much in it that I'm going to watch it a couple of more times. My favorite part was how to enhance your brain function and memory. Who doesn't need that?  I also like the part about keeping your brain tuned up as you get older. There are 24 lectures here. Some lectures are more interesting than others. but this is very interesting subject matter that affects us all.
