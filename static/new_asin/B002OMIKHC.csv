3961831,5,B002OMIKHC,"I absolutely loved this movie! I loved the comedy, the storyline, the action, the effects, everything! This may be my 4th favorite movie of 2009 behind Friday the 13th, Land of the Lost, and Halloween II! I've seen a lot of negative reviews toward this movie, but some people take things a little too seriously. This movie is for the kid in all of us. While on summer vacation, the Pearson family go to three-story holiday house in the middle of nowhere. The kids; Hannah, Tom, and Bethany don't wanna go, but they are forced to. They meet more family members like Jake, Art, and Lee. When Bethany's boyfriend forces Tom to the roof, they see the aliens who want to take over the world. Throughout the day, the kids try to stop them, without their parents finding out. One alien, Sparks is not a threat to the humans and decides to become friends with Hannah. Sparks is a cute little alien, unlike Skip, Tazer, and Razor. Will the Pearson children stop the evil aliens from taking over the world? I highly recommend ALIENS IN THE ATTIC!!!",1254096000,23,1038,4.55614973262032
3961832,5,B002OMIKHC,"Aliens in the Attic is pure fun & entertainment for kids & adults. Superb acting by young, middle aged, and senior cast members, even by Ashley Tisdale!",1250208000,2,152,4.666666666666667
3961833,4,B002OMIKHC,"My almost 9 year-old son and I saw this together. It was VERY, VERY funny. We both thought so. (There were way too many male crotch gags, in my opinion, and of course, the law enforcement representative was an idiot. However, we didn't see his underwear; so, this movie was superior to other kid flicks.) Robert Hoffman is outrageously funny as  Ricky  the lying-loser boyfriend turned robot alien minion. Ashley Tisdale carries off another major role with credibility, humor, and grace. The DVD is already on my son's wish list for Christmas, and I will be recommending Aliens to my friends to watch with their kids. I will also recommend it to parents of teenage daughters who need a laugh, a break, or a reminder that Eddie Haskell didn't die with the Cleavers.

3961834,2,B002OMIKHC,"I saw a blurb about ""Aliens in the Attic"" describing it as ""the perfect children's movie."" My first thought was whoever said that was being sarcastic. But no; I read further, and to my extreme disappointment, I saw that the writer was dead serious. Really? The perfect children's movie? I don't know--""The Wizard of Oz"" has been beloved for generations, as have ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Pinocchio,"" and I'm pretty sure ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""The Little Mermaid,"" and ""The Lion King"" will be remembered for years to come. If such a thing happens to ""Aliens in the Attic,"" then let me apologize now for failing to see the wonder and magic it supposedly has in spades. Maybe I'm too grown up to appreciate kid-friendly entertainment.

Or maybe this is one movie that even the kids shouldn't be watching. This is a goofy, sterile, inconsequential film that has no ambition other than to turn the minds of children into mush. It's about as enlightening as a cereal commercial aired during the Saturday Morning Cartoons lineup, and not even half as entertaining. The problems have nothing to do with the premise; believe me, I can buy into the idea of tiny green aliens invading earth as easily as the next guy. But when the most clever scene you can come up with is a ridiculous video-game/kung fu brawl between twenty-eight year-old Robert Hoffman and seventy-eight year-old Doris Roberts, you've officially proven that you possess the imagination of a tree stump.

""Aliens in the Attic"" follows a formula where the children are resourceful, the adults are clueless, and the situations are nothing close to possible. And I mean besides the whole aliens-are-attacking gimmick. Consider the moment the local sheriff (Tim Meadows) stops by the house to reprimand the children for making a fraudulent 911 call; the parents (Kevin Nealon and Gillian Vigman) suddenly show up and invite the sheriff to join them for their backyard barbecue, because, obviously, even an officer on duty needs to take a hot dog and burger break every once in a while. The sheriff accepts the invitation, naturally. No wonder the kids in these movies can't take the adults seriously; they make a lot of rules, but they never seem to follow them.

The plot: Reluctant math genius Tom Pearson (Tom Jenkins) is dragged by his Atta Boy Sport father Stuart and Play Friendly Everyone mother Nina on a fishing trip to a lakeside summerhouse in Michigan. Along for the ride are Tom's bratty teenage sister, Bethany (Ashley Tisdale), and his cute-as-a-button younger sister, Hannah (Ashley Boettcher). When they arrive, the Pearsons are joined by Nana Rose (Roberts), Uncle Nathan (Andy Richter), and his three sons--the militant Jake (Austin Robert Butler) and identical twin video game experts Art and Lee (Henry and Regan Young). To Tom's horror, Bethany's boyfriend, Ricky (Hoffman), also arrives. Ricky is a preppy jerk who wins favor with the Pearsons while secretly being mean to Tom. He's also lying to Bethany about something, but she's too love struck to notice.

When Tom finds himself on the roof trying to fix a broken satellite dish, he makes a startling discovery: Four well armed, knee-high, green, goblin-like aliens (voiced by Thomas Haden Church, Josh Peck, Ashley Peldon, and Kari Wahlgren) getting ready to plan an invasion of Earth. Oh no, they've shot a mind-control chip into Ricky's neck, and now the aliens can move his body with a handheld remote! As the aliens scurry through the ventilation system trying to get to the basement, the children immediately form a plan of attack, part of which involves tricking the adults into leaving the house. Not that it would have mattered; earlier scenes between the children and the aliens make it clear that, if anything noisy happens upstairs, the adults are under no obligation to take notice.

What a dumb, vacant movie this is, so lacking in style, originality, neatness, and plausibility, so innocuous, so devoid of anything even remotely fun or exciting. The filmmakers seemed to labor under the delusion that children aren't smart enough for something more fulfilling and mature. A tornado takes a girl from Kansas to a faraway land with witches, an Emerald City, and Munchkins? A boy discovers he's a wizard and goes to a special school of magic? A puppet is brought to life and must go on a mission to become a real boy? A young woman falls in love with a prince transformed into a hideous beast? All nonsense, apparently. But not ""Aliens in the Attic."" Because it's the perfect children's movie.

No, I won't accept that, and neither should you. Do not subject your kids to this movie. There are so many other choices to better stimulate their imaginations. They deserve something that actually makes an effort to tell a story, free from the maddening clichs of smart kids and idiotic parents and life lessons that don't go beyond the maturity level of a ""Full House"" episode. I recently had to sit through the mind-numbingly innocent Disney film ""G-Force,"" and I would rather they see that than ""Aliens in the Attic.""",1248998400,4,5115,4.928074245939675

The language was not bad other than a couple of crude remarks, and even though the cover looks cheesy, the movie was humorous and very entertaining.  The kids really laughed in a couple of scenes.  It is well done and has a lot of subtle humor, like when they call 911 to report that aliens had landed and the youngsters could only find an old dial phone to use.  You will not be disappointed.",1492387200,,526,4.21

I went in rolling my eyes thinking it would be terrible, and it ended up being a fun movie for our family to enjoy.  There's a fair amount of humor that the whole family can enjoy, enough action to keep the older ones engaged, but without really getting too scary for the younger ones.  Again, not a masterpiece, but for a family movie night or rainy afternoon you could do much worse.",1403136000,,519,4.329896907216495

3962053,5,B002OMIKHC,"I loved and laughed my way through this alien attack movie.  It's a family vacation that  quickly goes awry when aliens appear in the attic.  Parents are, of course, inconsequential as the kids befriend one alien and battle others to save Earth.  The aliens are well done.  Nothing really scary, just fun galore.",1400630400,,312,4.811320754716981

3962060,5,B002OMIKHC,"We had a movie night with the cousins, and I wanted something that no one had seen! Bought this movie and it was a hit with everyone, age range from 2-11.

3962061,3,B002OMIKHC,"I thought it was a cute kids film, but, some of the sexual references were a little unnecessary and uncomfortable for younger kids.  Josh Peck is not the best voice over character in this film, that disappointed me a bit.  It did have several funny moments, but is a little on the violent side. It's almost too corny for older kids, and too much for the younger ones...I don't know, just not one of my personal favorites.",1389657600,,421,4.454545454545454
3962062,3,B002OMIKHC,"My 5 year old saw a preview for this movie and really wanted to see it.  It looked OK from the previews.  I'd say it wasn't the best choice for our rather mature 5 year old.  There was a fair amount of the humor that centered around the tension between teens and the oldest child now seeming to be a high school graduate and dating a 20 year old grade A fake and jerk.  Most of this interpersonal drama and humor went over our son's head.  The rest was mostly slapstick kind of humor and some fun special effects that kept him interested and entertained.

It's not going to be a classic, but it was good for a Friday popcorn and movie night at home.  We'll likely dust this title off several years from now and give it another go or maybe just forget about it... who knows.",1389225600,,773,4.1824324324324325

3962073,5,B002OMIKHC,I that I would split my sides on this one. Who would think a granny could do martial arts and the girl's boy friend could be made to act like a jerk without the brother lifting a finger to make him do it. The kids were the superhero's and no adult had a clue as what was going on. It showed how resourceful kids can be when adults won't listen to them.,1381881600,,352,3.9027777777777777

3962078,5,B002OMIKHC,For whatever reason this movie is just loads of fun to watch with the kids.  From our perspective is a good comedy.  I especially loved the video game references.  For the price it was better to buy it then rent it.  Glad we did buy it.,1378944000,,236,4.065217391304348
3962079,5,B002OMIKHC,"This little movie is full of fun. It's got several subplots going to keep it interesting. The actors are very watchable. The
gags and special effects are hilarious and minimally violent. I loved it, and my 8 year old and 5 year old grandkids got a
big kick out of it. We like to watch it together when they visit. And it won't give the kids bad dreams.",1378684800,,352,4.1911764705882355

3962083,5,B002OMIKHC,"This move is a lot of fun; it's about kids on an elaborate vacation in a nostalgic time-share that is reminiscent of extended family life, clean water and air. The scenery is lovely and the colors are soothing although there are loads of things going on with the children and the aliens. They seem to be in a location that looks more like a lush camp ground area and the grown ups are null-n-void when the kids start squealing and doing what they do best -Tearing up everything and almost tearing down the house. This is one of those movies that I like to keep on while I am doing something else and checking out the exciting scenes every now and again.
The scene where the kids try to call the operator on a rotary phone is akin to the new digital phone system just before you re-program all of your phone numbers in the phone again (if you are calling across the hallway you still have to punch in your area code and then the remaining seven numbers)because all of the calls are like local long distance.",1375142400,,1006,4.3563829787234045

3962088,4,B002OMIKHC,This is a pretty funny film about extraterrestrial invasion when they're pitted against the all american family. It has plenty of sight gags and innuendo.

3962092,4,B002OMIKHC,"This might be a kids movie, but it was entertaining to this adult and it kept me laughing. Like most good films targeted for kids it was rather ridiculous, especially seeing granny turned into a Ninja, but it made for some funny scenes.",1369612800,,236,4.511627906976744

They vacation in a low-tech environment because its technology that caused this family to be dysfunctional. Of course the parents do not know what technology is so that is why they been a problem on technology. Against know about it all too well so that is why they been the problem on technology.

Nothing with keynote this change in the situation. Therefore, we throw in malicious aliens, goofy zombies, ""haven't got a clue"" authorities, and ET wannabe, and the kitchen sink. Maybe the kids will learn something from this. Maybe the parents will still go home without a clue. Maybe the authorities go off into the sunset. Maybe we spent X. minutes of our lives.

I am not saying that people who do not appreciate kid's slapstick would not appreciate this movie but they are the only ones that could.

Some of the actors are popular and evidently so is Ashley Tisdale.

For those with a tendency to enjoy this kind of movie I suggest you avoid this movie and watch ""The Goonies"" (1985).

For technophiles, I only saw the Blu-ray and cannot compare it. However, the visuals and sound is all that is promised.

3962191,3,B002OMIKHC,"The animated characters are not really that cute or cool, but Aliens In The Attic (2009) is serviceable, through perhaps not outstanding family entertainment.  Featuring kids trying to save their clueless parents from destruction, the story is one that would generally appeal to teenagers and below, with special effects that are solid, well-executed, and generally funny.

Brothers Stuart (Kevin Nealon), and Nathan Pearson (Andy Richter), bring their families together for the summer, renting a house near a lake in rural Michigan.  The Pearsons are just settling in, looking to do some fishing, when alien ships crash land in their attic with four pint sized aliens aboard, who are the advance team for an invasion fleet.  Using special weapons, they take over the minds Ricky (Robert Hoffman), the boyfriend of Stuart's daughter Bethany (Ashley Tisdale), and also grandmother Pearson (Doris Roberts), controlling them via hand held controllers, similar to a video game.

Fortunately the alien mind control devices do not work on children, leaving the Pearson kids the only thing standing between the aliens, and world domination.  Cousins Tom (Carter Jenkins), and Jake (Austin Butler) lead the fight, mostly battling them using toys.  Tom's little sister Hannah (Ashley Boettcher) develops a special friendship with one of the visitors named Sparks, which proves decisive in deciding the fate of mankind.

The film features some short but lively action scenes, and an extended fight between Ricky and nana that is ridiculously funny.  The film's final battle gets all the kids involved, and features a couple of the aliens blown up to gigantic proportions, bringing this lightweight tale to a close.

Kevin Nealon, Andy Richter, Tim Meadows as the sheriff, and Gillian Vigman, all provide good performances, but don't have much to do beyond playing straight men.  With a real gift for physical comedy, seemingly inspired by Jim Carey, Robert Hoffman is one of the bright spots.  Animated and adorable, Ashley Boettcher is a talented little actress, who usually brightens up the scenes she is in.

Aliens In The Attic isn't a must see, but it's well produced, fairly entertaining family fare that may be a pleasant distraction for kids.",1313280000,2,2240,5.258426966292135

3962201,3,B002OMIKHC,"Unlike ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" charming picture about alien invasion paying homage to B monster/alien movies, ""Aliens in the Attic"" is based on one joke: ""Kids vs. aliens in the attic."" Five kids Tom, Jake, Hannah, Art and Lee (Carter Jenkins, Austin Robert Butler, Ashley Boettcher, Henri Young and Regan Young, respectively) unwittingly discover an alien invasion is underway, just in the attic of the lake house they and their parents are staying for vacation. Luckily, the ""invasion plan"" of the four pint-sized aliens (who look like distant relative of Shrek) is not well thought out, as their device to remote-control humans is useless to kids.

This is a mindless light-hearted comedy, of which thin story is just an excuse for a series of comic set-pieces. Some are very funny, some just OK, and others (most involving adults) forgettable. The film heavily relies on sight gags including a handsome but obnoxious teenager Ricky (Robert Hoffman) and a grandma (Doris Roberts) turned into a remotely-controllable ""zombie"" (don't worry, no scary make-ups) fighting like a ""Street Fighter"" character.

Adult actors are not required to do much. They are hardly responsible for the dull characters they play. Ashley Tisdale as the bratty sister of the family fares no better. The film repeats the same joke (the puppet joke in particular), and though the five child characters are amusing, the film lacks imagination in plot and character development. In short ""Aliens in the Attic"" is a family picture, agreeable but not very original.",1283558400,,1537,5.193548387096774
3962202,4,B002OMIKHC,"Before I saw this movie the previews gave me the impression that this was just another computer animated and effects driven films trying to exploit a kid's inherent interest in this stuff. It turns out this movie has more thought put into it and a good deal more heart than I assumed (that's what I get for assuming). Aliens in the Attic isn't an instant classic by any means. However it delivers on what you want in a family sci-fi film. Cute enough in some places, witty enough in others.

So yeah, the plot isn't Shakespeare. You have a family on vacation that gets visited by some diminutive (and not too bright) aliens bent on taking over the world. This plot is very close to the same vein as the 80's movie Spaced Invaders. The difference, and it is substantial enough to keep the two movies from being similar, is where the focus is. Where Spaced Invaders put all of its attention on the wacky Martians, Aliens in the Attic puts its focus on the kids and how they deal with the invaders. For this movie it makes all the difference.

You see, the chemistry between the kids is tight. The main boy and his crazy cousins, lovelorn big sisters and a cute little sister all mesh their respective personalities into a coherent plot progression rather well. There isn't a whole lot of character development once the individual players have been established, but you don't need that much since the script capitalizes on the interactions. I'm not talking about two dimensional character clashes sort of capitalization. This movie shows a good example on how differing personalities can work together.

The acting is surprisingly good for these kids. All of them play their parts solid with nary a bad scene in the bunch. Ashley Tisdale is not the main focus of the movie, but her star quality wasn't wasted on. Although she is swimming in familiar waters with her character good acting is good acting. SNL alumnus Kevin Nealon and Tim Meadows both hit high marks in their comedic timing, even though Kevin mainly plays the straight man in his role. The big kudos, however, go to Robert Hoffman. He plays the jerk boyfriend to Ashley's character, and while the jerk scenes make you love to hate him the real joy in his performance come after the aliens take over his mind and Robert goes off on some of the craziest pratfalls and other physical humor with a hilariously crazy grin on his face. It's comedic gold!

The aliens are funny in a kids will get giggly kind of way. Sometimes they say something funny enough for the adults to snicker (include a funny observation on kissing). But mostly the aliens are for the kid's entertainment and are mostly two dimensional characters with very little to no depth. The CG animations for the aliens aren't bad, but they aren't going to really impress anybody on the technology either. Basically it's serviceable special effects for a production company that likely couldn't pull this off with puppets.

The Bu-Ray for the movie looks really great. Details pop out with a lot of clarity on both the CG aliens as well as the gorgeous backdrop of the vacation spot. Sound is also top notch with the DTS-HD 5.1 audio, but it's not exactly an audiophile reference kind of movie so don't expect to be blown away. Here's a quick rundown of the extras:

Introduction to Film with Ashley Tisdale - Just a quick hello from the move famous actress in the film. No big deal.

The Ashley Encounters - A short promo of the movie from actresses Ashley Tisdale and Ashley Boettcher. I wouldn't be surprised with this aired on the Disney Channel before the movie came out.

Alternate Ending - It's an unfinished product with the CG kind of in the middle phase of production. Not exactly a complete change from the actual ending, but it is different enough. Prefer the real ending anyway.

Behind the Zirkonians - It's a pretty long comic short story about the origins of the aliens. It's not exactly adult fare, but your kids will enjoy it.

Meet the Zirkonians - A little biography of the four aliens in the movie that you can browse through.

Lights, Camera, Aliens! -  A short ""making of"" featurette that's pretty light on details. Feels like another promo for the movie more than an informative documentary.

Kung Fu Grandma - This is funny and weird at the same time. It's like a video game commercial using footage of the movie. The title of this featurette is kind of a spoiler for the movie and I'm glad I didn't know about it before I saw the flick.

Brian Anthony ""Electricity"" Music Video - It's a music video with clips of the movie. Nothing to see here. Move along.

Fox Movie Channel Presents Life After Film School with Barry Josephson - This is the REAL ""Making Of"" documentary. It has more details on the film's production than the other fluff featurette, but it's not an all-inclusive thing.

Deleted Scenes and Gag Reel - Didn't get a chance to see these yet. They run about four minutes each and are self explanatory.

If you have kids ranging from grade school to the tweens I believe this film will keep them entertained provided they enjoy watching light science fiction to begin with. Others may enjoy it too for the other fun stuff, but maybe rent first to test the waters. For the adults it really depends on your threshold for this kind of entertainment. The aliens will annoy most of you, but the kids and grown ups in the movie will entertain. If you have a Blu-Ray player it's definitely worth getting if on BD if for nothing else so you can see the beautiful landscapes in high definition.",1282003200,9,5545,4.624618514750763

So now it is up to the kids to save the planet using the skills they learned from video games along with modified toys.

It's light-hearted (despite the scary aliens), humorous, and has decent special effects. Unlike a lot of kids films today, there are really no attempts at hidden crude humor and I can't think of anything that should give parents cause for concern. In fact, I can tell it's aimed for a fairly young audience - I had never heard of Ashley Tisdale before, and didn't think she was anything particularly special based on this movie. I think adults can enjoy it as well (as I did), but it won't have quite the wide audience of something like the PIXAR films.

The plot was a bit cliche - think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T-The-Extra-Terrestrial/dp/B000A2IPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Goonies/dp/B000P0J09W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Goonies</a>. A bunch of kids, generally social outcasts in their own ways (nerds, video game addicts, etc), find the vanguard of an alien invasion. One of them is friendly, leading to almost E.T.-like scenes between Ashley Boettcher (Hannah) and Snuggy the alien. The others are downright devious and wretched, comparable to the goons in Goonies.

I have to say, watching Doris Roberts jump-kick Bethany's creepy boyfriend was easily the highlight of the movie. For kids, this would be 5 stars, but overall it's probably closer to 4 stars.",1277683200,,1644,6.536697247706422

3962239,4,B002OMIKHC,"Aliens in the attic is your typical, fun Family comedy.  Hollywood churns out dozens of these a year, and some are memorable(Beethoven), and some are not (Kazaam).  Aliens in the attic is easily lost in the stampede of family films from 2009, but that's unfortunate.  Even though the plot, gags, and dialogue isn't exactly unique, that doesn't mean it should be dismissed.  The movie is actually quite good.

The children are the main actors in the picture and they do an excellent job. The adults all play supporting roles and do so well.  My only complaint is that at times the adults were just to vanilla.  Expecially the cop played by Tim Meadows, didn't he used to be funny..

The one Adult that I really enjoyed was Doris Roberts, who is really funny in this picture.

The special f/x won't blow you away but they are done very well.  The fight scenes in the movie will be all to familiar for the dads who grew up playing Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat(that for me put the movie over the top)

In short, a great movie that families will enjoy watching and laughing through",1263513600,,1080,4.544041450777202

3962262,4,B002OMIKHC,"I agree with several reviews I've read on this movie that 1 - I don't see many adults watching this one without their kids no matter how young-at-heart they are, 2 - the Ricky character and his antics MADE this movie, and 3 - it is almost criminal to have Kevin Nealon, Tim Meadows and Andy Richter together in a movie and not give them more to do.

I have a nine-year old and we watched this together one Friday evening and were entertained through and through. We rewound a lot of the Ricky-the-robot moments.

Seriously, I was really impressed with Robert Hoffman's performance and the physicality of it. I figured out that he must be a dancer pretty early on (I even checked to see if he was in one of the Bring it On movies because of his cheerleader bit), but even his FACIAL expressions were hilarious. Those SYTYCD judges are always saying that to be a good dancer you have to be a good actor. He could build a pretty solid career out of physical comedy roles once dance movies and musicals fall out of fashion again.

I think another large part of my enjoyment was also that I am of the Nintendo generation. I may have kids of my own now, but I ""get"" video games and why kids like them. So the concept of a Mortal Combat-style battle with live people controlled through video game consoles was very entertaining to me. There were some Matrix-like moves, which has been done to DEATH, but it was with a 70+ GRANDMA, so I enjoyed it without any groans.

As for the underused adult comedians, maybe they were there to pull the adults into the movie seats? KN and TM on Saturday Night Live is when that show was must-see TV for me. That is THE cast in my mind. Or they initially gave them more to do but they realized in the cutting room that this movie is really about the kids? I certainly hope the target audience of this movie don't know who Kevin Nealon is. They do NOT need to be watching his contemporary work.

I will purchase this one, but for my nine-year-old to watch over and over.",1257724800,,1998,4.331550802139038
3962263,5,B002OMIKHC,"I never thought much about this movie but my friend bought it so i watched it with him the other night. I liked it a lot. I didn't know what to expect.

Their battle royale was amazing. Anyway,this movie is worth seeing. It's fun and enjoyable for everyone.",1257292800,,429,4.512820512820513
3962264,3,B002OMIKHC,Its basically as the previews set it out to be. Aliens in the attic. Not as funny as I thought it would be and my kids seemed to like it but it definitely isn't a repeat movie like Monsters Inc.,1257292800,3,194,3.875
3962265,2,B002OMIKHC,"This could have been the new age Gremlins, but what it is really dull and predictable. 4 aliens decide that a summer home is the place to start an invasion and its up to a pair of teenage boys, a pair of twins and their good hearted little sister to defend the place. They defend the place by using the heat, and the aliens own sci-fi age weapons. All while keeping it from their parents, a local officer and grand mother.

Although the movie has Kevin Nealon, Andy Rictor and Tim Meadows are in the movie, they could really do less in it. It's all focused on the kids, which I suppose it should be, its a kids movie.

As for the aliens, they aren't ruthless or scary, because this is a movie for kids. If anything they're little formulaic. There is a leader, a female, a thug and a good hearted one that questions the leader. Pretty typical.

The only redeeming factor was a remote control character named Ricky. Ricky starts out as the jerk older boyfriend of the main character's older sister. When the aliens strike, they shoot him with a gun that makes him remote control. Naturally hilarity insues as the aliens, and children can make him talk, act like a goof, back flip and anything else. Its almost like children wrote the movie. He is a great source of comedy and if he weren't in it, the movie would be very bland and run of the mill. In fact the movie should be called ""Aliens control Ricky.""

Other than Ricky, it's just a chore to sit through. The movie feels very stale, very quickly; after all, 99% of the movie takes place in a single house within a single day.",1257292800,4,1578,4.357142857142857
3962266,4,B002OMIKHC,"The summer 2009 adventure family film ""Aliens in the Attic"" will entertain you with it's kid-friendly comedy, not so much reliance on the grownups and a film that manages to capture  the time of youth and adventure.  The film has made over $56 million worldwide and now its set for a release on Blu-ray and DVD.

The film is directed by John Schultz (""Bandwagon"", ""The Honeymooners"") and features a screenplay by Mark Burton (""Madagascar"", ""Chicken Run"", ""Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit"") and Adam F. Goldberg (""Still Standing"", ""Aliens in America"", ""Fanboys"").  The film features music by composer John Debney (""Hannah Montana: The Movie"", ""Swing Vote"", ""Evan Almighty"") and a screenplay by Don Burgess (""Enchanted"", ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"", ""The Polar Express"", ""13 Going on 30').

""Aliens in the Attic"" revolves around the Pearson family.  Tom Pearson (played by Carter Jenkins, ""Viva Laughlin"", ""Surface"", ""Bad News Bears"") is an intelligent person who is great a computers and a hacker.  On the day that his parents Stuart (played by Kevin Nealon, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Weeds"", ""Grandma's Boy"") and Nina (played by Gillian Vigman, ""The Job"", ""The Hangover"", ""Sons & Daughters"") were checking up on his grades online, they noticed that his grades were changing.

Meanwhile, Tom's sister Bethany (played by Ashley Tisdale, ""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"", ""High School Musical"", ""Phineas and Ferb"") tries to sneak in through his bedroom window after her big date with her boyfriend Ricky Dillman (played by Robert Hoffman, ""Step Up 2: The streets"", ""The Onion Movie"") who Tom can't stand.  While his little sister Hannah (played by Ashley Boettcher) tries to warn them that their father is upset and coming to see him, Stuart tells Tom that he needs to stay away from his computer, do better in school and he will have to go on the family trip for a day of fishing and staying at home that they leased for the summer.

While the Pearson family made it to the home that they are staying, they are greeted by Stuart's mother Nana (played by Doris Roberts, ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), his brother Nathan (played by Andy Richter, ""The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien Show"") and his children Jake (played by Austin Robert Butler, ""Ruby & the Rockits"") and the video game playing twins Art and Lee Pearson (played by Henri and Regan Young).

For the two families to meet each other again for this vacation, its apparent that Tom and Jake don't quite get along as Jake is younger but more dominant and tougher than Tom.  And to make things worse for Tom, Bethany's boyfriend Ricky has also schemed his way into being a guest at the home.  Jake convinces Tom to take action against Ricky and use his paintball gun to get him to leave the premises.  But of course, it all backfires and Tom's parents feel bad for him and Tom gets another lecture.

As the whole family try to enjoy their vacation, because the TV stopped working, Ricky volunteers to fix the satellite but wants Tom to join him upstairs.  Meanwhile, we see a spaceship(s) arrive on top of the house.

While upstairs, Ricky tells Tom that he is lying about his intentions of coming to their house and that he is also not a high school student but a man no longer in school.  And to get back at Tom for the paintball incident, Ricky forces Tom to fix the satellite himself.  And as Tom check on the satellite, he sees that the dish has been destroyed.  Jake joins Tom on the roof and is surprised about the damage caused to the dish but then things go crazy as a shadow of some creature shows up on the wall.  As they turn around, they are greeted by four mean aliens: The leader Skip, the warrior Tazer, the intelligent engineer named Sparks and a female named Razor who want to capture both Tom and Jake

As Ricky, tries to talk to Tom, not knowing there are aliens behind him, he is shot by a dart on the back of the neck and is now being controlled by the robots.

Meanwhile, all children come in contact with the aliens and now the war is on.  Aliens work up a strategy to get to the basement in order to find a device that will call down its alien fleet to attack the Earth, while the children do what they can to prevent it from happening.

Will the kids be able to stop the aliens in time?

""Aliens in the Attic"" on Blu-ray comes with two discs, the original Blu-ray with the film and the special features and a second disc which contains a digital copy of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Aliens in the Attic"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1, AVC@22MBPS).  With a good number of scenes are shot during the day, the colors are vibrant and even indoors, inside the house there is good enough lighting that you do see the detail in the homes, destruction caused by the children and the aliens.

Audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital) and this is where ""Aliens in the Attic"" shines.  Dialogue and music is front and center channel driven but it's the good amount of LFE that you hear during the action sequences that catch your attention.  Especially at the end when you hear the stomps with that deep bass coming out of your subwoofer, almost reminiscent of that ""Jurassic Park"" T-Rex stomping, a good amount of that during the action sequence at the end.  Especially during the implosion of a machine where you hear this long reverberating sound that sounds really nice.  I didn't hear any major use of panning or any significant surround usage, especially with the rear surrounds but for the most part, for a kid-friendly film, good use of lossless audio during the action sequences.

Subtitles are featured in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Thai.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I watched ""Aliens in the Attic"" with my six-year-old son and both of us enjoyed it.  Personally, I think that there are going to be a lot of children films that touch upon fantasy and once in awhile, it's good to have these type of films where the parents are not too important to the plot but it's the children working together to take on the enemy.  Personally for me, it reminds me of the zaniness of a film such as ""The Goonies"" but for a more younger demographic that know their video games, know who Ashley Tisdale is and for adults, a film to just watch and enjoy without having to critique how the CG doesn't compare to the latest Pixar film or how this film did not screen for critics.

The kids bring some charm to the film.  You have Carter Jenkins playing the very intelligent Tom Pearson, but in the beginning, tries to shave off his ""book smarts"" because it's not cool and in the end, I personally though the message with his character was quite positive for children.  Being smart doesn't mean you're not cool.  Austin Robert Butler as Jake Pearson, the child who thinks combat/strategy is a predictable gung-ho character (especially when he owns an expensive paint ball machine gun, you know where that's going).  For the video game fans, the twins Henri and Regan young reaches out to those who know their video games.  From one sporting the old school Activision shirt, to them using their video game skills during the body control parts of the film.  And dare I say, I had fun seeing the ""Street Fighter 2' Shoryuuken and spinning kick move that the kids use on Doris Roberts character Nana.  And Ashley Boettcher as the young Hannah Pearson who is the cute innocent young girl who befriends an alien, ala young Drew Barrymore who played Gertie on ""E.T."".

Ashley Tisdale provides that young star power for those who are familiar with her Disney Channel TV shows or her films and also her music.  But the shining star happens to be her boyfriend Robert Hoffman, who portrays the craziest role when he gets controlled by the aliens and later on by the kids.

As mentioned earlier, the adults do not play a major role in this film.  Sure, we have former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members Kevin Nealon and Tim Meadows and ""Late Show with Conan O'Brien"" sidekick Andy Richter and also actress Gillian Vigman.  But the adults do not really interfere in the film but you do get to see ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" actress Doris Roberts as the grandmother Nana Rose Pearson being mind controlled and the video game twins use her a fighting video game-like character.  Sure, it's corny but for fighting video game fans who recognize the fighting moves, you can't help but laugh and root for grandma.

But the hijinks are hilarious, the characters are fun and my son enjoyed the film as well.  Personally, I figured that I grew up with such 80's films as ""E.T."", ""The Goonies"", ""The Monster Squad"", where kids work together to take on an enemy.  Sure, we have that now with a few adventure films but it's good to have something different (especially when its aliens) and a film that is not so serious.

As for the Blu-ray, personally, I enjoyed the Blu-ray release.  I thought the picture quality was good and the audio quality especially the utilization of LFE (especially at the end) was a nice tough for the audiophiles. And for the Ashley Tisdale fans, there are a good number of special features for you.

Parents who are wondering if this is suitable for children, I think four years and older would be fine.  It's not a scary film at all but perhaps the sight of green aliens with sharp teeth may be a bit scary for them.  But for the most part, this is a kid friendly film.

Overall, ""Aliens in the Attic"" is not as adventurous as ""The Goonies"" or ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", emotional as ""E.T"" or dark as ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" but the film does well for its own as a kid-friendly film with a fun group of young characters trying to fight off four aliens who are trying to trigger an alien invasion.

""Aliens in the Attic"" is an enjoyable family film that is fun, hilarious and entertaining, especially if not taken too seriously.  Overall, a  film definitely worth giving a try!",1257292800,7,11923,4.686057692307692

This may be my 4th favorite movie of 2009 behind Friday the 13th, Land of the Lost, and Halloween II! I've seen a lot of negative reviews toward this movie, but some people take things a little too seriously. This movie is for the kid in all of us. While on summer vacation, the Pearson family go to three-story holiday house in the middle of nowhere. The kids; Hannah, Tom, and Bethany don't wanna go, but they are forced to. They meet more family members like Jake, Art, and Lee. When Bethany's boyfriend forces Tom to the roof, they see the aliens who want to take over the world. Throughout the day, the kids try to stop them, without their parents finding out. One alien, Sparks is not a threat to the humans and decides to become friends with Hannah. Sparks is a cute little alien, unlike Skip, Tazer, and Razor. Will the Pearson children stop the evil aliens from taking over the world?
