8025382,5,B0002B55C0,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Volume 20 is great. Inuyasha and the others escape from the sage wanna-be, and Sango returns to her village. While on her journey, Sango is met by 2 sisters that beg her to train them. Their home is under attack by tons of demons, and they need the skills to defeat them. Sango agrees to help them, but it is too late for their family. Sango sees a bit of herself in the 2 sisters and learns that she is not alone in her grief. Naraku also hires a dark priestess to kill Kagome. She uses the jewel shards to put a death curse on Kagome.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353283200,,1682,4.253125
8025383,3,B0002B55C0,"It's hard to rate just this one disc. The series is so long, it's hard to remember exactly what I'm reviewing on just this one disc.

I actually got tired of the show years ago because I could only watch three episodes at a time as the DVDs released and this is about the point where I caught up with release dates and stopped watching because this disc wasn't out yet. When it did release, it was too costly. $30 for 3 episodes??
I recently started watching the series again and purchased the rest of the third season because most of the discs were only a couple bucks. Even at that cheap price, it was almost worth it to just buy the boxed set. I did buy the boxed sets for the remaining seasons, and currently on season 5.

I don't like that Viz only included 3 episodes on each disc and the Special Features are lame.
Additionally, when they re-packaged the series into Season Box Sets, there were more episodes per disc, but even less special features.
I suppose Viz did a good job of getting there money though.

This is a decent show. Enjoyable, but way too long. I'd say that I honestly wish I hadn't bought the whole series because I don't think I'll ever watch it again (which makes it not worth owning). I'll probably try to put it up for sale once I've finished watching.

I recommend renting.",1337990400,,1305,4.3580246913580245
8025384,5,B0002B55C0,Tsubaki is a 50 year old dark priestess who got younger thanks to Naraku giving her a shikon jewel shard. Naraku made a deal with her if she can help him defeat Inuyasha and the gang the dark priestess can have the whole jewel which will make her young forever. Tsubaki use her snake to bit Kogame's leg to collect her blood so Tsubaki can put that on the shikon jewel which will turn Kogame into evil so she can kill Inuyasha. Tsubaki was defeated by Kikyo 50 years ago.,1123459200,,471,4.2444444444444445
8025385,4,B0002B55C0,"They said that episode 58 in that series had the highest TV ratings in TV to that date.

This was where Kagome was so emotional thinking Inuyasha died from a fall in human form but the plant saved him and the sun began to rise to make Inuyasha a half demon again.  The ending was very funny.",1116806400,,291,4.087719298245614
8025386,4,B0002B55C0,"The first episode, ""Fateful Night in Togenkyo, Part II"" concludes one of the more pointless plot detours in the series.  It's weak on nearly every level.  For some reason this is one element of the manga that appears out of order; whatever the reason, they could have dispensed with this.  At least other plot detours like ""The Lake of the Water God"" were only one episode.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, the next two episodes are excellent.  The modestly named ""The Beautiful Sister Apprentices"" is one of the best stand alone episodes in the series thus far.  The story centers on Sango, and two young girls who wish to become demon-slayers, but involves much more than that.  There's a strong moral message in this episode, about living a strong life, looking after your family, your friends, and the person you love.  I can't think of a better episode in terms of utilizing the impressive soundtrack of the show; nearly every scene includes one of the better tracks found on soundtracks 1 and 2.  There's comedy, action, drama, all well blended.  This is one of those episodes you'll wish was an hour long, rather than just a half-hour.  Of the 70 episodes I've seen, this one would make my top 10, maybe even my top 5.

The final episode, ""The 50 Year Old Curse of the Dark Priestess"" begins a five episode sub-plot that is very good, though you'll be frustrated that it ends here, so quickly.  Much like the first movie Kagome is forced, this time through a curse, to turn the sacred arrow on Inu-Yasha, shades of Kikyo 50 years before!

If you can wait it might be better to purchase an entire season's worth of episodes when they are relased together (season 1 so far is the only one available in this format).",1108339200,3,1719,4.63036303630363
8025387,5,B0002B55C0,"In this volume we see the end of the battle between Inu-Yasha and company and Tokajin, the human/demon sage. (On an interesting note, this story actually happened just before the chapter where the group first meets Sango. That makes this a rare story that gets shown out of order in the anime.) My one real criticism with this story is that we don't actually see any of the nameless other people who've been shrunk down return to normal size, we're just supposed to accept that it happened.

In the second story, Sango returns to her now abandoned village with her demon cat Kilala to repair her weapon and meets two young girls, Suzuna and Serina, who tell her that their village is menaced by demons and that they wish for her to train them in the art of demon slaying. I especially loved this episode as it centers around Sango, who is my personal favorite Inu-Yasha character.

In the final episode, Naraku enlists the help of Tsubaki, a witch with a grudge against Kikyo, who puts a curse on Kagome in an effort to kill Inu-Yasha. This is quite an intruiging episode, as it's neat to see Kagome being used for evil (even though she doesn't want to be).

The voice acting is great as it's always been. I very much enjoy Moneca Stori as Kagome, Richard Cox as Inu-Yasha, Kelly Sheridan as Sango, and the rest. I really loved the scene where the group has thought that Inu-Yasha has perished, and then find out he's still alive and Kagome berates him for taking needless chances through her tears, and he tells her to stop blubbering, and we get to another arguement between the two. In short, this is still a great series.",1091664000,10,1625,4.539249146757679
