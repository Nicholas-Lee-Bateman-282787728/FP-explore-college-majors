720757,5,6303832431,this movie was sooo good! i mean even tho my teacher fast forwarded through all the good parts....it was still a truly romantic and amazing work that showed perfectly the internal and external conflicts. With ladislao fighting with his feelings while Camila and ladislao fight to be together in a society that opposes their love. Amazing movie and i reccomend it for everyone.,1098921600,4,376,4.984126984126984

720759,5,6303832431,"This film was excellent! I guess I am saying that becaue I am a true hopeless romantic and I fall for movies that contain romance and forbidden love as well. This film represents the patriarchal system and how it interferes with people's lives. Camila is a young women and Ladislou is a priest. Their love affiar is forbidden in the eyes of the church, family and government. However, they both follow their hearts in order to stay together. In return they go against the patriarchal system and are followed.  It is important to note that the director Mara Luisa Bemeberg has a major influence on this film. She uses her own experiences and feminine nature to produe such films as Camila, or Yo la peor de todos. She is a great director and made this film attract a lot of viewers attention. I think it is important to mention that if this film were to be told by a man, then there would be different interpretations and the story about CAmila and Ladislou may be inaccurate. Overall, I loved the film!",988070400,20,1002,4.535911602209945

It's the most romantic film I've ever  seen, and after all these years of watching it, still moves me to tears.  The cinematography is wonderful, and it's beautifully acted by all. The  stars, Susu Pecoraro and Imanol Arias are fabulous, lovely to look at, and  the erotic chemistry between them makes this story very believable. The  scene in the belfry ! Ladislao:""What am I going to do with you  ! "" Camila: ""Anything you want"". sounds cliche, except it's  between a priest and a socialite, and what happens after that will move you  and amaze you.

I thought it was an extremely well done movie that deserves more credit than just some romantic  ""chick flick.""  It is a loosely based story of Camila O'Gorman,  an Argentinan aristocrat who dreams of true love, a husband that she can be  proud of, and a future companion with more than a respectable name and bank  account.  She finds this dream in a Jesuit priest, father Ladislao, whom  eventually admits his love and escapes with Camila.  The two become hunted  fugatives, criminals of sacrilege, and outcasts of the upper class.  Though  Ladislao has trouble dividing his love between Camila and God, they share a  powerful bond that cannot be broken; it's stronger than any government,  social codes, or weapons.  At times it was slow moving, and romantic, but  it wasn't a ""cheesy"" romance.  I believed what was on screen  rather than laughed at it.",945648000,30,981,4.772455089820359
720763,5,6303832431,"Camila is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  Not only is it the expressive and artistic representation of forbidden love during a time of great political turmoil, but it is also very representative of  Argentine culture and politics.
  Through the punishment of Camila and  Ladislao ordered by Rosas and carried out by ""los federales,"" the  audience sees the power and force of Rosas' government.  It is very obvious  how Rosas controls the lives of all Argentine people and forces them to  follow his rules and beliefs.  The film's tragic ending presents a critique  of Rosas government as an overly harsh and unnecessary force in Argentine  history.
  The release of this movie in the early 1980s along with other  movies such as The Official Story, and Man facing Southeast, represented  the new-found political and artistic freedom of Argentina.  As it became a  democracy in 1984, Argentina was free for the first time in its history to  present new and controversial ideas about politics or about life in general  that varied from conventional thought.  Camila is an absolute  masterpiece, combining love, history, politics, violence and tragedy in one  amazing film.  I give it the highest praise, and recommend it to anyone who  has an interest in Latin American history or who is a true romantic at  heart.",945388800,35,1331,4.963470319634703

*Plot and ending analyzed*

Camila (1984) is a pompous, excessively melodramatic story that rarely rises above the crass emotionalism of a cheap novela, or tele-novela (a soap opera in Latin-American countries). The film stock reduces it even further, since it seems to have been shot on some 'video' camera. The angles are so dull and boring, there's hardly any life in this film at all.

In the 1840's of Buenos Aires, Argentina, an utterly lifeless respectable woman, who later falls into the category of ""demimonde"", lives her boring life with her tyrannical father, who is overbearing, imperious and autocratic. At an instant, there's not much for us to root for, since these wealthy people are so repulsive. Yet the director, Mara Luisa Bemberg, thinks we should side with Camila, because she reads a few ""banned"" books. The director throws everything at us from afar, from the drowning of some pet cats on the tyrannical father's order, to the beheading of the bookseller. Clearly, she's not one to engage the audience with slow-nuances, but merely histrionics.

Enter some Jesuit priest, Ladislao Gutirrez, equally boring and without merit. Well, Camila takes to him right off. I can't see how she falls for him so quickly, he's about as empty as a bare bottle that's molded up in the cellar. The rest of the story has the authorities searching for them after they've consummated their ""love"". Everything is brought down by a priest appearing out of nowhere, who finds them in some local village and they are executed.

The film is pathetic, emitting little sympathy from clear-headed viewers; it is gut-wrenching in the extreme. Instead, it seems to be more of a tome or dictum intending to show how the affairs of the heart override any social order.",1476316800,,1802,4.953642384105961

This film is based on the true life of Camila O'Gorman, a wealthy young socialite, and her priest lover Uladislao Gutirrez in the late 1840s Buenos Aires of dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas.  When Mara Luisa Bemberg made this film, the military dictatorship of the 1970s and early 80s, with their years of torture and extra-judicial killings, had just ended the year before; but their sinister influence was still very prevalent.  I consider this film a bold slap to their faces.  This is an excellent film which tells the story of individuals, history and the costs of tyranny, both to individuals and society.  The other two films that, in my opinion, continue the story of the consequences of repression are ""La historia oficial"" (The Official Story, 1985) and ""Vidas privadas""(Private Lives, 2001).",1263772800,,971,5.081761006289308

Directed by the immensely talented director Maria Luisa Bemberg the '85 film `Camila' is a tale of tragic romance set in 1847 Buenos Aires. Camila (Susu Pecoraro), daughter of a wealthy and powerful family falls hopelessly in love with Father Ladislao (Imanol Arias), a new priest just recently arrived in town. When they run away together their actions stir the already volatile political/religious turmoil engulfing the country. When their whereabouts are discovered the ""Powers That Be"" must decide whether or not making an example of the two lovers could be advantageous to the governmental unrest.

I found `Camila' to be rather slow at times, especially at the beginning. The acting was also a little uneven delivering a number of stiff and uninspiring performances from the supporting cast while the two stars, Susu and Imanol tend to be overly dramatic in stark juxtaposition to the rest. However the pace does pick up quite a bit towards the end of the film and the ending is touching and poignant. Definitely a ""chick flick"" so gentleman beware.

721269,5,6303832431,"What a beautiful piece of work. I am a 24 year old man, and they say men (or kids as they are now) are not supposed to cry, but let me tell you something ladies and gentlemen, I was torn apart after watching this classic. 3 days later, I am still shaken. I love the fact that you hear actor's real voices and not their English substitutes, it gives you a much better feel; yes you'd have to read subtitles (not that bad, honestly). Camila is not a pampered blue blooded girl, though her father is the exact epitome of the demonic and cold, blood drinking elite. With these people their goals come above everything else or as they say it in their trait ""End justifies the means"". So he could care less about what she wants, it is all about what ""they"" want. With this poor priest Ladislao being a Jesuit priest, some of you would beg to ask a question, ""So when does the Jesuit Order come into play?"" Not to worry, they of course do. As some reviews stated above, Rosas government was hand in hand with the Catholic church, so you would probably realize where the orders were coming from. Ladislao gets caught by his fellow Jesuit priest who recognized him while at some celebration. The very sad thing is that Camila and Ladislao had a chance to escape and probably live happily ever after. The police chief who has befriended them in their new place of living and who was present during the Jesuit priest's identification of Ladislao told Camila to take horses and get out of town before dawn - as he would come and arrest them at that time. Well they stayed, as Ladislao seemed like decided to get back to Jesus and his priest life. The rest is...............well Niagara Falls time, bring your handkerchiefs in plenty. Very sad ending, no, sad would not describe it, something else, I am not in power to give the words to it, as I am not some great poet who with ease can paint a picture for your mind. In the end it also shows what soldiers/cops would do, without any remorse, without any morals, without any thought or question. With those kinds of tactics we loose as humans, time to wake up, for we've been sleeping for far too long.

Ohhh why didn't they take those horse, why??",1188777600,3,2186,4.424317617866005

721272,5,6303832431,"Una historia veridica llevada al cine magistralmente. Todos los actores realizan unas actuaciones tan maravillosas que en realidad uno cree estar viviendo en el 1848...

Imanol Arias (Ladislao Gutierrez) transmite tanta pasion, amor y deseos prohibidos que es comprensible el por que Camila, sacrifica todo por el. Aparte de ser un actor increiblemente guapo, se adentra tanto en su personaje , que te hace llorar, amar, rezar y sufrir con el.

Mi escena favorita es cuando Camila le confiesa su amor y le dice que se esta muriendo de amor, el le dice que eso es natural a su edad, como queriendo ignorar que es de el que ella esta hablando.  Su amor ya en ese momento es mutuo y el enferma de amor. Lucha entre su amor por Dios y su amor por ella.

Definitivamente una pelicula que merece la pena ver, maravillosamente actuada, con unos efectos de luces tenues

que le dan un toque de romanticismo, una musica fabulosa ,

unos dialogos en susurros entre los enamorados llenos de

pasion, la lucha carnal entre el amor humano y el amor a Dios y

un tragico final.

Mi pelicula favorita se la recomiendo a todos...",1144368000,7,1113,4.637755102040816
721273,5,6303832431,"Set in Argentina during Rosas' dictatorship, Camila, directed by Luisa Bemberg, manages to make forbidden love seem like the ultimate sacrifice.  Bemberg is a master of melodrama forcing us to focus on the romance between a beautiful Irish girl and a handsome Jesuit priest and forget that this love story is about sacrilege and indiscretion.

Based on the true story of Camila O'Gorman, the first woman in the history of Argentina to be executed.  The cinematography is beautiful and the music is subtle.  This movie works on so many levels. I'd hate to give away any of the incredible plot, but as a love story this has no comparison.

As a historical film we see Rosas as a ruthless dictator who got away with murder becuase the upper class looked away. Even though Camila came from the elite, and the priest was well connected, rules were not made to be broken.  I'd hate to give away any of the incredible plot.  Whether you're a fan of the romance genre  or not, don't miss this memorable movie.",1135209600,11,1001,4.6477272727272725
