8459210,5,B0009Y8P8Q,"I sought out this disc containing two shows from the 1950's TV series ""Telephone Time"" when I learned that the teleplay GOLDEN JUNKMAN was among Lon Chaney's personal favorites. And I can now see why he was so proud of it. In 1956, a year when Hollywood theatrical releases tended to merely exploit him (cashing in on his past status as a horror film icon by casting him in non-speaking roles in the ""B"" horror films THE INDESTRUCTIBLE MAN and THE BLACK SLEEP), this inaugural episode of ""Telephone Time"" gave Lon the opportunity to display his ability to truly act, to deliver a sensitive and nuanced performance.
  The story of the GOLDEN JUNKMAN in and of itself is pretty standard stuff, yet the show is still a joy to behold, for it gives us a chance to see a largely unknown charming and lovable Lon Chaney role, the type of poignant character study at which he excelled, but that was sadly a rarity later in his career. The show stands as a reminder that Chaney was far more than a novelty, much more than just a portrayer of monsters. He was an actor of great range and skill who all too rarely got the chance to shine at his brightest. If you are a fan of Lon Chaney Jr, this show belongs on your ""Must See"" list. It's not great television, but it IS  great Lon Chaney.
  The second episode on the disc, GRANDPA CHANGES THE WORLD, proved to be a delightful bonus, starring Thomas Mitchell as an aged lawyer arguing in court for freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Colonial America. The Academy Award winning actor is as good as ever in this period piece, supported ably by a cast that includes Barney Phillips and John Eldredge, two of the best and most familiar supporting players from television's first decade. The dialog is crisp and cleverly written in this tale ostensibly based on true events, delineating a fictionalized, but none the less thought provoking glimpse at the sociopolitical environment that led to the drafting of the Bill of Rights.
  Overall, this disc provides a short hour of concise entertainment. The production values of both episodes are top notch, and the audio and video of the disc itself are also of the highest quality. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys the work of either of these two fine actors from Hollywood's Golden Age, as well those who appreciate dramatic television of the fifties.",1420329600,,2366,4.619047619047619
