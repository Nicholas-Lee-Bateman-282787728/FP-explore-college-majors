3580045,5,B001FB17CS,"This dvd was marvelous and I had to  turn up the volume and play it again SAM.  This is a great resource in the library to pump me up when I really need a JUMP START. I was first turned on to them by a high school track mate of mine who was in turn turned onto them on his honeymoon.  I subsequently bought nine cd's of theirs. There performance is electrofying, bone popping, finger snapping and clapping to their every stricking of the strings.  ENJOY it.",1294099200,10,457,4.218390804597701

8301768,3,B001FB17CS,"This was recorded when the older huskier guy did all the vocals.
A much better concert is when all the brothers take turns singing lead.
It is Gypsy Kings Live in London at Kenwood House.

It starts out as a daytime concert, ending at sundown.  The video quality is sharp and the camera work does a great job showing all the musicians.
It is one of the best concerts and DVDs I have ever seen.",1375488000,,393,4.226666666666667

8301770,1,B001FB17CS,"Was very excited to have received this concert,but.....upon viewing it I was disappointed(not in the performance)but in the way it looked. Was very dark,blurry with visible pixels in the background. Sorta reminded me of a bad VHS copy that was burned to a DVD. Haven't had this issue with other DVDs from Amazon so,maybe it was a fluke,but this DVD does not look professionally produced.",1361923200,,387,4.969230769230769
8301771,4,B001FB17CS,"It was remarkable to me that the Gypsie Kings still sounded very similar to earlier concert DVD's. Sure, they've turned gray, like the rest of us approaching our sixties. But what do you expect? The group is a little smaller, but they have the same drive and intensity of the old days when they burst onto the scene. If you're a fan, I highly recommend this DVD.",1361232000,,362,4.417910447761194
