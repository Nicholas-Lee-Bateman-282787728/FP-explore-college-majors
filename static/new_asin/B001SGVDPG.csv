3785566,5,B001SGVDPG,"Really the end of the line? It was left wide open to be able keep it going but in honesty it was time to end it. While my wife and I loved the show (we have them all, the first 6 seasons/series in Region 4) why would people keep going with nothing but unhappiness and disappointment ALL OF THE TIME? Guess that's the disadvantage of seeing a season in a marathon viewing instead of over the course of an entire TV season. We think the Australian's have it right when they can bring in new characters and still keep a show ""alive"", but when you can recognize some story lines from earlier years, time to hang it up! The first 4 seasons are about the best.",1243814400,2,654,4.198412698412699
3785567,5,B001SGVDPG,"Excellent, product was received on time and in great condition.  This is one of the best series we have every watched; I have my husband, and most of my five sisters watching this as well.  We were very sad this was the final season for McLeod's Daughters.  We love to watch films about Australia.",1243555200,12,297,4.462962962962963
3785568,5,B001SGVDPG,I LOVED the whole series of McLeod's Daughters.  I couldn't stop watching and when I received a complete season I couldn't turn it off.  A  friend started watching with the same result -- GREAT SERIES!!!,1243468800,7,203,4.742857142857143

3785570,5,B001SGVDPG,"This was the best series I have ever spent my time watching.  I felt as though I lost a family member when they suddenly stopped it here in the USA.  Now have all sets except for Season 8, that is on its way as I write. Yippee!!",1242086400,5,228,3.8297872340425534

3785572,5,B001SGVDPG,Watched this show from the beginning and have all 7 seasons. Can't wait to get this one. Can't help wondering what the difference is between this set and the other shown as Season 8 and Final Series which looks like it's a little bit more money and it looks like it's available now. This was one great show and I recommend it highly.,1239235200,5,333,4.301587301587301

3785574,5,B001SGVDPG,"I have followed all this series with avid interest. My sister and niece are now also so involved in this story. We have had similar experiences in our day,though not in Australia. We all agree it is about the best TV series we have ever seen.",1237334400,5,242,4.282608695652174

3785590,5,B001SGVDPG,Awesome series!  Have been a fan for years.  WB only ran first 3 seasons.  Had to purchase so I could watch the rest!,1397088000,,117,4.0
3785591,4,B001SGVDPG,My husband says he thought the acting in the series was so realistic and made you believe the actors were living what was in the program,1393027200,,136,4.269230769230769
3785592,5,B001SGVDPG,"I watched all 8 seasons because once you watch season one, you are hooked. However once they killed off (beep beep beep beep) and then didn't bring (beep beep beep) back, I found myself fast forwarding a lot ...  Wow, it was powerful though ...",1388361600,,244,4.4222222222222225
3785593,5,B001SGVDPG,I only heard of this series this year 2013.  I started watching and could not stop.  I loved each and every episode.  It is just a wonderful series.  At the end of series 3 i just cried like a baby.  I only wish they would bring this show back and make a movie.,1386979200,,261,3.849056603773585
3785594,5,B001SGVDPG,"I loved McLeod's Daughters when on Hallmark and sad when they dropped it. Then the DVDs went on sale and I am proud to say I own the entire set. This is the first and only TV series for which I have purchased DVDs. I still go back and watch it from the beginning. After a hospital stay and home rest for several weeks, I was able to start at the beginning and go through the end with out the wait between seasons being released. It was relaxing which is what they told me to do",1381363200,,477,3.9791666666666665
3785615,5,B001SGVDPG,Anyone who watches the McLeod's Daughters  would enjoy it - the 3rd season is especially sad - makes you cry.  Definitely a series worth watching - you can get hooked on it!  Worth having for your collection!,1379894400,,208,4.5675675675675675
3785616,5,B001SGVDPG,"This is a wonderful series.  I am an Aussie and it definitely is very authentic - except for the cattle duffing (rustling) bits -it hugely overplays the crime situation, however I guess that makes for good tension.  I came from a West Australian cattle station so I am very familiar with outback life - although this is semi rural the problems are very similar.

American audiences may have some difficulty with the language.  We are as some wit said two countries separated by a common language",1379462400,,495,4.72093023255814
3785617,5,B001SGVDPG,When the series was on TV they only showed up season 2 here.  I have gotten the complete show to watch when I was post surgery-- what a way to spend my down time.,1378771200,,162,3.764705882352941
3785618,3,B001SGVDPG,"I loved this series initially, but as all the main characters disappeared...some with the flimsiest excuses...I found it harder and harder to connect to the new characters (who seemed to drop from the sky).  C'mon, how hard is it to get on a plane from Argentina, already? Great writing and story line in the first few seasons...after that, it felt like a class assignment in writing school, where everyone got a chance to write an episode and it didn't matter whether they were connected.",1375056000,5,489,4.821428571428571
3785619,4,B001SGVDPG,I enjoyed this series- very addicting.  I was happy to see that their was an eighth season - bringing the story to an end.  My only problem - the actresses were getting progressively annoying!  By the end - I was happy to see them go.  There was nothing like the original cast - before they started killing everyone off and moving them to foreign countries.  All in all - a fun series - I did enjoy it very much - especially the constant fly swatting notorious for Australia!,1373932800,4,475,4.3522727272727275
3785620,5,B001SGVDPG,"I found McLeod's daughters on an obscure cable channel many years ago.  When it stopped airing, I had to find out how the ongoing story was unfolding, so I set about buying the entire series.  Yes, it is a ""soap"" but has characters you wind up caring about.  And the setting in Australia is stunning",1371168000,,299,4.4
3785621,5,B001SGVDPG,"All eight sessions were excellent ! And I hate to see it end.
Love all the characters and especially love all the horse work.
Only regret is that I didn't buy the whole series at one time.
Well worth the money no matter how you buy it though ...",1367193600,,245,4.020408163265306
3785622,5,B001SGVDPG,I purchased the entire series.  Love to watch and rewatch.  Focus is on the daily struggles of ranch life with a group of women trying to keep the business afloat.,1366934400,,163,4.4
3785623,5,B001SGVDPG,"At last, sad, it comes to an end. I will miss these strong women. The ending was timely and right.",1365552000,,98,3.95
3785624,5,B001SGVDPG,This is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. I watched the whole series on Neflix.,1363564800,,102,4.15
3785635,5,B001SGVDPG,to bad it had to end it was wonderful series you watching over and over. you will not forget this wonderful tv series,1359936000,,117,4.130434782608695
3785636,5,B001SGVDPG,"This whole TV series is great.  I had never heard of it until I saw it advertised in a brochure that came with a Heartland DVD I had ordered.  It is an Australian series that ran for 8 season, about women/sisters running a cattle/sheep ranch in Australia in modern times.  Of course the ranch next door is owned by a rich landowner that has two sons that are constantly involved with the women.  I will warn you up front the show can be very emotional.  Wait till you get to the end of season two and you will understand why I said that.  Over the length of the series, there are changes to the main characters as they come and go for different reasons.  However the series ties it all together very well.  I am not quite sure who the prime audience for this show is.  In Australia it was extremely popular with the women.  I suggest you do like I do, when first trying out a new series, and just order season 1 at first.  If you like season one as much as I did, you will be hooked, and then end up ordering all the other seasons.  Just one comment, don't just watch the first episode before making a decision.  Give the show a chance and watch at least the first half dozen or so episodes, if not the entire first season, before making up your mind.",1354838400,,1251,4.184100418410042
3785637,5,B001SGVDPG,"GREAT SERIES. NOW I HAVE THEM ALL AND LOVE IT. DOESN'T PULL ANY PUNCHES, IS JUST LIKE REAL LIFE ON A RANCH. LOVE THE AUSTRALIAN ACCENTS, AND THE PEOPLE. BUY IT, YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY IT, MATE.",1344902400,,192,4.216216216216216
3785638,5,B001SGVDPG,"I have watched this show over and over and I'm not one for TV shows. All Eight Seasons are wonderful. You Laugh, you cry, Wish you where there! They have everyday problems and enjoy the the little things in life. The women are strong, but you are able to see the soft scared sides as well. The men are good lookng and make you wish you were one of those girls. I'm sorry the show ended, but with the DVD's I still get to enjoy them all over again.",1344816000,,447,4.033707865168539
