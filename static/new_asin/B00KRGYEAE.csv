8660979,3,B00KRGYEAE,"WWMM presents this telling of three tales,Is actually pretty good.

The acting and the scripts is above what is expected.

Hidden camera-Three girl friends are catching up on the drama with boyfriends and dating as a whole and things get conflicted and turn from sexy to uber violent.

Sweet mirror- Wow,The star has a Rumer Willis vibe and  does things for a possessed mirror &  to her mirror,That most geeks would trade their Magic The Gathering collection for.
