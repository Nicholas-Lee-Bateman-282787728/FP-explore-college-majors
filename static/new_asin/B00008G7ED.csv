1843882,4,B00008G7ED,"The toons in this set are not classics because they are so great, but rather because of the fact they are vintage toons from the golden age of animation of the 30's and 40's before studios started making the animation cheaper with less frames.

Jack Frost is an Ub Iwerks toon from 1934.  Jack Frost arrives in the forest, painting the leaves on the trees and warning the animals to prepare for the winter. An inquisitive young grizzly bear decides he wants to see what the world looks like when everyone else is hibernating. When Old Man Winter catches him unawares, however, he needs Jack Frost's help in getting back home to his warm bed.

Santa's Surprise (1947) features the first appearance of Little Audrey.  Little Audrey and some other kids stow away inside Santa's sleigh. While Santa sleeps, the kids decide to give him a Christmas present of his own

""Somewhere in Dreamland"" 1936 is a Fleischer studios toon.  It's the story of two poor children who are out collecting firewood when they pass by a toy store, market and finally a bakery. They drool over the wares in the bakery window but walk away before the owner can come out and present them with two cupcakes. The kids go home and eat a meager supper before going to bed. They both dream they are in dreamland, where everything is free--cookies, candy, cakes, popcorn and toys. When they wake up it's all gone but the three merchants have stopped by to lay out a huge feast for them.

""Chrismas Comes But Once a year"" Fleisher from 1936.  A group of lonely kids are given broken toys, leaving these sad youngsters without a Merry Christmas. Professor Grampy, sees the unhappy kids. The brilliant inventor puts on his thinking cap to find a solution this problem.  He heads into the orphanage and creates a series of homemade toys from kitchen utensils. Then he decorates the main room with soap chips, cotton and other items, creating a Santa suit from red cloth, stovepipes and a red bag. He rings a dinner bell and calls the kids in. The kids, seeing Grampy as Santa, rush in happily. They play with their new and better toys.

""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer""  Fleischer 1944.  The Fleischer version of the classic tale.

""Hector's hectic Life"" Paramount 1948.  On Christmas Eve, Prince the dog's owner threatens to throw him out if he causes any more trouble. Just then, a basket arrives on the doorstep containing three puppies that look suspiciously like Prince. The puppies proceed to trash the house while Prince desperately tries to conceal the damage from his owner.

""Snow Foolin'""  Paramount 1949  Singalong about the first day of winter, when all the animals go ice skating. It is December 21, and the animals in the forest must contend with a literal avalanche of snow. Winter is not all that bad, though. After donning their winter coats, they will be able to enjoy themselves skiing, skating on a frozen lake, and tossing snowballs. In just a few days, one and all will be singing ""Jingle Bells.""

Wonderful collection for its historical value.",1102982400,48,3028,4.7352380952380955
1843883,3,B00008G7ED,"""Classic Christmas Cartoons"" is an almost-duplicate of the now out-of-print ""A Cute Cavalcade of Classic Christmas Cartoons.""  The only real difference is that this DVD has 7 cartoons, rather than ""A Cute Cavalcade...'s"" 12 cartoons.
Each of these cartoons are good fun, and true ""classics.""  The real standouts of the collection are the Fleischer Bros. cartoons, and Ub Iwerk's spooky ""Jack Frost.""  Being from the 30's and 40's, several of them are depression-influenced, showing sad-eyed orphans and poor kids lusting for Christmas treats, and may contain a few stereotypes of an unpleasant nature, but nothing terribly shocking.
Definitely for lovers of old cartoons only, or very young children who don't mind the different styles and slightly odd characters.
The DVD is of poor quality, which is expected for such ancient cartoons. Restoration takes money, and this collection of public domain prints is just to get them out there. Nothing fancy, but nice to have in any format.
The seven cartoons are:
Jack Frost (Ub Iwerks, 1934)
Christmas Comes But Once a Year (Dave Fleischer, 1936)
Somewhere in Dreamland (Dave Fleischer, 1936)
Santa's Surprise (Seymour Kneitel, 1947)
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (Max Fleischer, 1948)
Hector's Hectic Life (Bill Tytla, 1948)
Snow Foolin' (Izzy Sparber, 1949)",1069718400,72,1306,5.392156862745098

I also bought the Christmas cartoon classics DVD, just in case it disappointed me. Well it didn't. But I still opened this DVD to see if it was equally as amazing.
Well it was!!
Unfortunately it had most of the same cartoons as the other DVD. Buuuuut there were a couple different cartoons.
I kept both DVDs even though they were similar just because I thoroughly enjoyed them.
Plus it was easier to keep one of each in each of the TVs that we commonly watch movies on.",1455408000,,513,4.244897959183674

1844010,4,B00008G7ED,"No, seriously--with this disc you'll have a ball.  Today's youngsters will dive in head-first to the stuff we former kids in our forties/fifties/sixties had to watch at school assemblies the last day of school before Xmas Vacation......and all in their reddish (or greenish or purplish) glory.  Film prints so dilapidated and decrepit they give a very genuine feeling, and therein lies this DVD's appeal.

You'll get thrice-familiar fare (that's shown up on so many public-domain videos) like Max Fleischer's original film treatment of ""Rudolph"", and the Hanna-Barbera-ish ""Santa And The Three Bears""; as well as a movie-short treatment of ""A Christmas Carol"" (it really rushes along a story much better suited to a feature-film treatment), and many cartoons that have been hard to find merely because they were in black and white (the kiddies don't have any use for THAT, do they?).  Among these rare gems are the early-30s cartoon ""Christmas Night,"" starring the famous comic-strip character The Little King; as well as the very early Warner cartoon ""The Shanty Where Santa Claus Lives"" (produced by Harman-Ising, before they moved their studio to M-G-M to do their much-better-known Technicolor cartoons).  But some of the color shorts are quite worthwhile, too: like the treatment of ""The Night Before Christmas"" by the British husband-and-wife team of Halas and Batchelor; as well as ""The Candle Maker,"" one of a considerable number of films here that (thankfully) remind us deeply of what the true meaning of the occasion is.

Some stuff here you'll enjoy greatly just to laugh at the CRUDITY and AMATEURISHNESS of it all: particularly the puppet films, using the always-standard marionette or hand-puppet techniques.  Of the latter, one I especially enjoy is ""Santa In Animal Land,"" a story that actually covers a very broad geography but which is, by and large, limited to just one set, where a cat, dog, frog & ostrich live--all concocting a plan to bring Christmas to all animals IN THE WORLD!  A very-much-implausible story, but still an endearing one.
