8465390,3,B005CFC0AQ,"While shopping for THE HUMAN STAIN I happened upon this 6-film bundle.  Of the 6, The Human Stain is best, in my opinion. The rest are predictable chick flicks, pretty much Lifetime TV fare.",1418860800,,190,4.588235294117647

8465396,5,B005CFC0AQ,"I don't know what that other reviewer was smoking, but I am sure glad that I have better taste they do. First off, all movies are widescreen and fairly decent in picture quality. Actually the quality is quite good, considering the price and that four movies are jammed onto a single disc.

""The Human Stain"", ""The Crossing Guard"" and ""The Night Listener"" are all excellent high minded thrillers with exceptional casts. As you can see from the cover art, these movies star Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman,. Jack Nicholson and Robin Williams, all Oscar winners, all giving great performances here.

""Benefit of the Doubt"" starring Donald Sutherland, another fine actor, is interesting, but more like a solid tv movie. ""Heaven"" with Cate Blanchett and ""The Innocent"" also starring Hopkins aren't really good, only passable movies. However, the acting is great in all of these movies.

At that discount price, I would happily recommend this set to anyone who actually likes good movies and can appreciate quality actors in memorable performances.
