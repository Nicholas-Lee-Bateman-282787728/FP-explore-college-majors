7877212,4,6304649320,"after a big fight with Raditz, wouldn't u wanna relax on a comfy couch? well, not Piccolo, and he takes Gohan, and makes him train. He leaves him out in the wild leaving him to fend for himself. Hope he can take care of himself. If ur a dbz fan, wanting to complete his/her collection defenitly get it, but if u can't, no biggy, but still try to get it cos it's pretty good.

7877213,5,6304649320,"This is My Favorite Anime ever! Better than Pokemon, Sailor Moon,or Rayearth...they DON'T even come close. I always hate the poor voice actors and Kiddy Phrases...but DBZ is not one of those!  This is ACTION Fighting  oh yah i love it...it's da BOMB! Even if it says  "" Suitable for ages  five and up "" don't let that discourage u it is NOT for ages five and  up...even at a Record store it said 13 'n up...that was not even uncut!  UNCUT is even better u gotta get it!  e-mail me if u have any questions!  My e-mail is.... "" coly12@ratedg.com "" .",959040000,2,547,4.242718446601942
7877214,2,6304649320,This is the lowest I rated DBZ but what is it with funimation? they should have a 17 minuite thing (gohan makes a friend) about gohan finding a robot world! DAMN FUNIMATION. I'll learn to buy captain ginyu ones from here  because they are uncut  any way this DVD was bad there are better ones than  this but buy this one but you'll be disapointed..........,954633600,,356,4.446153846153846
7877215,4,6304649320,This one is awesome!  It could use a little more action on Goku's part though. Gohan gets left behind in the wilderness by Piccalo,923443200,,130,4.416666666666667
