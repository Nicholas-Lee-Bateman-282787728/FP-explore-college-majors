3548601,5,B001EAWMP6,I saw this movie in the theatre and decided to tract it down for my DVD collection.  It had a huge impact on me and was the movie I thought about when I was looking at the preview of the Olympics to be held in Australia. When they featured the Aborigines playing their instruments as a positive part of Australia the disrespect of how the Aborigines came to my mind.  I realize that things may be different in Australia now and this chapter of their history may be only a part of their past but as an African American I double that.  A DVD that you may also want to watch on this subject is Rabbit Proof Fence.,1357344000,,610,4.1525423728813555
3548602,5,B001EAWMP6,This film is an excellent example of the prejudice faced by the aborigine peoples of Australia and the white people who treated them much as the black people of our country were treated for so many years.,1314662400,2,204,4.54054054054054
3548603,4,B001EAWMP6,"This is a very good film. Not  as devastating as Rabbit Proof Fence but nonetheless a tragic testimony to the effects of racism and ethnic abuse. It does not preach but simply presents the events without obvious bias. Racism begets racism and when Jimmy has enough, his monstrous acts toward innocent white are not sanitized. But still, we see the reasons for his brutality. A superbly acted film and the Australian landscape is sspectacular.",1293235200,6,442,4.972972972972973
3548604,5,B001EAWMP6,"I had just about abandoned all hope that this marvelous 1978 sleeper from Australian writer-director Fred Schepisi would ever see the light of day on DVD, until I was pleasantly surprised to see it pop up on the ""new release"" rack of my favorite neighborhood independent video store last month (I quickly snapped up the last copy). Adapted from Thomas Keneally's novel (which was inspired by true events) this semi-epic culture-clash tale concerns the travails of the title character, played with explosive intensity by non-professional actor Tommy Lewis. Jimmie is a half-caste Aboriginal, living in New South Wales in 1900. He struggles between the pull of his native culture and the insistence of white sponsors who want him to ""do the right thing"" and assimilate into ""civilized"" society. This is easier said than done; it seems that the harder he tries to please everyone, the more he is shunned by all. Jimmie sublimates his reaction to the enveloping systemic racism and roiling inner conflicts for too long, which eventually leads to a shocking explosion of violence. This is visceral, powerful and disturbing stuff (not for the squeamish), but well worth your time. The film makes an excellent companion piece to the more recent Rabbit-Proof Fence. The DVD includes a recent interview with Lewis.",1229904000,17,1305,5.131455399061033

8297412,5,B001EAWMP6,"I was very pleased to find this piece of my visual past.  It's a great story and slice of time.  Story follows the lives of two brothers, one of whom is deeply rooted in Aboriginal culture despite his missionary upbringing.  The other is brainwashed into believing he must adapt to the white Anglo culture who will never accept him.  You watch as Jimmie experiences more and more tension between his desire to marry white and have ligher-skinned children (""not seriously black at all""), and his growing recognition that no matter what he does, he will always be a despised outsider.  Great acting reflecting the changing attitudes of Australia in the 1970's and 1980's.",1483660800,,669,4.884955752212389

8297415,4,B001EAWMP6,"""Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith"" is a notable film for its portrayal of a potentially good individual who is driven to become a renegade because of the way racism creates a cage around his existence.  Based on the true case of a man, half-Aborigine and half white, named Jimmy Governor---this film made quite a splash in 1978, but has become unjustly neglected in the time since.

""Jimmie"" is portrayed by a novice actor named Tommy Lewis, who does a good job conveying the character's nave sweetness and inability to understand and cope with the white society that he wants acceptance from.

Despite the harshness of the subject, the film is very beautifully shot, and has to be one of the prettiest of all Australian movies.  Any American watching the movie will see obvious parallels to the treatment and isolation of American Indians.  But unlike a Hollywood Charles Bronson vehicle, this is not an over-the-top, half-breed revenge flick.  It's a more subtle study of how mistreatment causes one individual to go over the edge.  In spirit, the film might have more in common with ""Badlands"", the Martin Sheen movie, than it does with Bronson's ""Chato's Land"".  Jimmie Blacksmith ""declares war"" on white society after he experiences repeated slights and condescension--in fact, a kind of nullification, from the entitled whites.  He doesn't understand the unwritten codes.  ""They expect us to (mess up)"", he rants to his half-brother.  But his rebellion is the act of a loner, and even his brother deserts him in the end.

The movie is also memorable for a good performance from Angela Punch McGregor--then known simply as Angela Punch---and an early appearance by actor Bryan Brown.

The source material is a novel by Thomas Keneally, who also wrote ""Schindler's List.""",1401494400,,1769,5.037800687285223
8297416,5,B001EAWMP6,"Excellent interpretation of an excellent novel. It captures the horrendous attitude of the Australians (all recently arrived from elsewhere) towards the people who had been there for 40,000 years. Only the American attitude towards the Indians, whose country they took by force, was comparable.",1383609600,,294,5.704545454545454
8297417,4,B001EAWMP6,"This was a highly disturbing look at post-colonial Australian society and our attitudes to the indigenous Australians.  A powerful story, well done in film.",1382140800,2,156,5.5
