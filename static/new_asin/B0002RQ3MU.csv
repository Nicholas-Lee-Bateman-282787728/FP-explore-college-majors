2116265,5,B0002RQ3MU,"This second season's worth of ""What's Happening!!"" (1977-78) is just as funny as #1. There are some standout outings in this release that made me laugh very hard, but I'm not going to go into detail about that. I will just say that it, like #1, is a very good purchase if you are a fan of the cleaner comedy of the past. I will echo what some other reviewers have said-- that this one and #1 are the two best seasons of the series. I am kind of leery about #3 though, because I have heard that the series jumped the shark in that final season with the change of direction to apartment life and the introduction of a cop and his son and the departure of Mabel King.

Therefore, that said, if you purchase any of ""What's Happening!!"" on DVD, I would advise that you purchase #1 or #2 or both-- stay clear away from #3 unless you can stomach a cop and his son and the extreme change in format, among other things. After all, it is usually extreme format changes, if I remember correctly, that make (and have made) some series ""jump the shark.""",1225152000,2,1040,4.252525252525253

2116277,4,B0002RQ3MU,"I wasn't born until after the show ended, but I loved watching the re-runs while I was growing up (and I still like watching them, although I have each of the seasons on DVD).  It was a great show with a strong message about our society.",1191715200,,237,4.1521739130434785

2116279,5,B0002RQ3MU,"This season is the funniest of TV shows I remember watching as a kid. Here are the reasons:

The Doobie Brother's episodes....""Which Doobie do you be?"" - Til' this very day, any time Michael Mc Donald appears on Tom Joyner/Steve Harvey, they use that joke.  And strangly, it is still funny.

Dee's first date ""Well it worked on 'Baretta'""  How many times have you told your momma that.

The Givens Kids episode...with that catchy ""brown bubblin' sugar"" song.

Rerun worships lettace...'nuff said.

If this is not a reason to run out and buy it...then see the third season of What's happening....you'll apppreciate this one more.",1170201600,2,628,4.923809523809524
2116280,5,B0002RQ3MU,"I have all three seasons of this show - next to Good Times, it was one of my favorites.  Some of my favorite episodes are the Burger Queen; I couldn't believe that Dee, played by Danielle Spencer, would actually say jackass meat on TV.  Going, Going, Gong is another favorite; I just loved the Givens Family.  They actually could be the next Gladys Knight and the Pips with the three cool fellows and their pretty sister; gosh, that Audrey Givens could really belt it out!  The Teen center episode on season three is another favorite of mine; Ernest Lee Thomas sings a really meaningful song along with the number he and his TV sister, Danielle Spencer did.  They really could be known as the Donny and Marie of Watts.",1141689600,2,718,4.534883720930233
2116281,5,B0002RQ3MU,Good Family Viewing,1137196800,,19,5.666666666666667
2116282,5,B0002RQ3MU,"Season two picks up where season one left off very smoothly.  We still have the same quirky characters and their shenanigans and it's just as funny.  Dee is still bratty but she tones it down a bit and shows a softer side.  She's just as funny though.  Some of the memorable episodes are the one where Rerun's brother in law gambled his vacation money on a football game based on Rerun's advice which was based on Dwayne's ""system"" of picking the team with the fancier helmets, the one when Rerun shaved his head and joined a lettuce worshipping cult, the two part episode where the boys were forced to tape the Doobie Brothers concert and who can forget Dwayne singing ""Handy Man"" in class?  The writing hardly missed a beat!

Unfortunately Mabel King (""Mama"" Mabel Thomas) would pass on two decades later as well as Shirley Hemphill (Shirley) and Fred Berry (Rerun).  Thankfully the series is on DVD to help keep their memories alive as well as reminiscing of a time when television could be clean and funny at the same time.",1132358400,,1027,4.6098901098901095
2116283,5,B0002RQ3MU,"I' m only 26 so I wasn't even born when ""What's Happening"" was on TV, but I use to catch re-runs a few years back. I just had to have this to own and enjoy whenever I want to. It's still funny over 25 years later! Dee is too much! Even my 7 year old son watches and laughs along with me! They don't make shows like this anymore!! I enjoyed every episode on every disc!!",1122595200,5,369,3.8684210526315788
2116284,5,B0002RQ3MU,"I'll try not to echo verbatim what the other reviewers but I loved this show during its first run in the late 70s when I was a child and I love it now.  I loved it so much then that I used to put my tape recorder up to the television speaker and record the episodes so I could listen to the show at any time.  Watching it now, there are lines that I hear that take me back 30 years to when I first heard them.

I tended to like the women of the show more.  Momma, Dee and Shirley were the funniest of the bunch to me.  Everything they said makes me laugh.  Especially when Rerun cuts on Shirley and runs out of the soda shop, the other laugh and Shirley says ""you hear sumpin funny, huh, you hear sumpin funny?"" and it shuts everyone up immediately.  Mommas well-timed zingers like when Dee once asked her ""Are you gonna to work today Momma?"" and Momma said ""You wanna eat tomorrow?""  And of course the little kid sister from hell, Dee Thomas.  She was THEE main reason I watched this show as a child and now.

Watching the 1st and 2nd seasons on DVD now saddens me a little knowing that so many of the characters died and so young too.  Its also ironic how each of the actors who died were very overweight.  It makes it particularly heartbreaking to watch a scene from the Christmas episode.  Her boss let her have the night off to be with the kids but they made plans to be at their dads house.  She calls her boss to ask to work that night and finds she isn't needed.  Man thats a sad scene.  It makes me think of how tragic Mabel King's life was after she left the show.

The DVDs are packaged nicely and are contain easy-to-understand on-screen menu options.  Each DVD lets you skip forward or rewind scene-by-scene, which is always a plus to me.  The episodes are clear and crisp.  I pop the dvds in while getting ready for work so I can laugh before heading out the door.

Whats Happenin was definitely good, clean comedy without being too slapstick-ish or too buffoonish (though Rerun definitely comes close).  I also think its short run makes it even more of a classic, because it didn't go on for years and years and become dreadful to watch.  Though unfortunately it did kinda lose its steam in Season 3.  But if the powers that be decide to release Season 3, you can best believe I'll buy it.",1118188800,12,2304,4.24367816091954
2116285,5,B0002RQ3MU,"I used to watch the show on reruns(no pun intended) when I was a kid and used to tape each episode so that i can watch them over and over and over again. Now as an adult i have the DVD boxsets and I can still watch them over and over and over again...

Bring on season 3 please!!!!",1117152000,4,281,3.76271186440678
2116296,4,B0002RQ3MU,"What's Happening, based on the film Cooley High, was on the air from 1974 to 1979. In the 2nd season, if you are a product of the late 60's, you may remember that Mabel king, who portrayed Mrs. Thomas, was seen less often. Even the late Fred 'Rerun' Berry, was not seen in every episode, thus Danielle 'Dee' Spencer and Haywood 'DeWayne' Nelson were featured more prominently, and guest stars such as the Doobie Brothers and Greg Morris (Mission Impossible / Vegas) appeared. To see a young Debbi Morgan (Angie-All My Children, Mozelle-Eve's Bayou, The Seer-Charmed) is a treat. Can't wait for season 3.",1114300800,8,603,4.8076923076923075
2116297,5,B0002RQ3MU,"This is the 2nd Series, Dee is still all that.  Dee came up with some really funny lines.  Shirley is a funny character, too.  Roj, Re-Run and Dwayne, the dynamic goof-balls, so funny.  I watched this show when I was in High school.

I am very happy to own both the first series and the second.  I would suggest buying both 1 & 2, they are both funny and worth the money.  I love Dee's sarcasm.  Shirley with her ""Watch it sucker"" is funny, too.  Dee is Roj's sister.  Shirley is the Waitress at Rob's Diner.  This is a series that brings back the good old days, at least to me.",1112400000,4,578,4.117117117117117
2116298,5,B0002RQ3MU,"I am so glad they released the second season of this great show!

I know a lot of people might disagree with me on this but THEY DON:T MAKE TV LIKE THIS ANYMORE!!!!

This is excellent collection for fans both old and new. Watch this with your kids and they will get hooked! My 10year old LOVES this.",1109548800,,299,4.137931034482759
2116299,5,B0002RQ3MU,"The 1970s was the true hey-day of television, and What's Happening!! was one of the real gems of that era; it is one of the funniest sit-coms of all time.  This show was a staple of my after-school afternoons when I was growing up.  I've seen every episode more times than I can count, but it had been years since my last trip to the soda shop and Mama's house.  Watching these shows again now, I have to say they are funnier than ever.  Season Two was probably the best season of them all, filled with one memorable show after another.

Just look at all the things that happen in Season Two: Rerun gets married - almost - to a pretty little foreigner played by Irene Cara; Tim Reid shows up to counsel Dee about ""her friend's problem.""  Raj ends up in small claims court (with Dwayne as his key witness) when he wrecks his delivery bike; Raj almost gets expelled when he starts an underground school newspaper; Dwayne's dad gets elected to the city council; Raj's and Dee's father gets married - in their house; Mama goes back to school; Raj organizes (then tries to disorganize) a strike at the market where he works; Raj wins a spot on The Gong Show for a quartet of singers in Dee's class; Dee goes on her first date; Rerun messes up big-time and finds himself illegally taping a Doobie Brothers concert; Rerun joins a cult that worships a head of lettuce called Ralph (one of the stupidest but funniest TV episodes ever); and Rerun finally - finally - graduates from high school.

The characters of Dee and Shirley (my two favorites) really grow during this second season of the show.  We watch Shirley take a secretarial job, only to learn she was only hired because she was black, then later see her take on a motherly role with Raj and Dee.  Dee's mouth is bigger than ever (is there a better, funnier smart aleck to be found in television land?), but we actually see a little bit of Dee's soft side emerge late in the season.

Several other reviewers have mentioned Dwayne's ""Handyman"" song and dance as, going and away, the funniest scene of the whole season.  I wholeheartedly agree - that performance is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life.  All of the episodes are hilarious, though - every single one of them.  You spend your hard-earned money on a lot of DVD season sets and never watch the episodes a second time; with What's Happening!! you can watch the same old DVDs over and over again because the comedy never grows old.  It would have been nice to see some extra features included here, but this is a true bargain at any price.  If you have great memories of this show, get this DVD and rediscover the good old days spent with Raj, Rerun, and Dwayne.  If you've never seen this show, you have no idea what you're missing - they don't make shows like this anymore.",1106006400,29,2804,4.436647173489279
2116300,5,B0002RQ3MU,"They are all good.  but my favorite show was when they had the talent show at school and Dwayne performed and sang the song ""Hanyman"". Oh God!!!!!  LOL!!!!  I literally start crying everytime I watch that episode!!!!!

This has got to be the funniest sitcom ever made.  I can't wait for the third season to come out.",1104796800,,316,4.473684210526316
2116301,5,B0002RQ3MU,"I used to see the reruns of this on a local station back in the 90s, and haven't seen it since. These are worth every penny and then some!

I hope they release ALL seasons PLUS start a release of the 1985 return of What's Happening NOW, where they all return after Raj is married, and goes into partnership with Shirley running Rob's place. The only place where the customer has a choice between paying his tab or getting his face ripped off!",1104451200,,442,4.325301204819277
2116302,5,B0002RQ3MU,"In the second year of 'What's Happening' the show got

even BETTER!Not only do we get to see Rerun almost end up bootlegging a Doobie Brothers concert but also almost end up with a head of lettuce (named Roger?????)as his personal savior!

And who can forget Ma Mabel's hilerious turn as 'mother nature' at the end of that episode. What's so cool is that TV now is so politically correct that I doubt a religious cult could even be HINTED AT let alone explored this way today,especially Raj's speech about kooky cults that are 'only out for the dollar'.And what else is there?Well in the end the gang end up sharing an apartment but that's all I'll say now. WHEN IS THE THIRD AND FINAL SEASON COMING OUT??????",1103241600,,709,4.53125
2116303,5,B0002RQ3MU,"Needless to say I was absolutely thrilled when the second season of What's Happening was released! I grew up on sitcoms from the 70's, so I could really appreciate how well written this show was compared to the utter crap of sitcoms today. It's been wonderful to revisit these charaters, especially the late Fred Berry. He was my favorite character,because he possessed so much self confidence despite being overweight. I also have to admit that I have watched the episode when the Doobie Brothers guest-starred about 20 times!!! I fell in love with their music all over again and Michael McDonald has the most gorgeous blue eyes!!! I can hardly wait for the third season to be released! I can think of alot of other classic sitcoms that are long overdue to be released on DVD like, Maude,Alice,and in honor of Tony Randall the Odd Couple!!! In the meantime I'll continue to enjoy the gang from What's Happening!!! Tamra Gibson of Los Angeles,CA.",1099872000,,946,4.809815950920245
2116304,5,B0002RQ3MU,"If you get this title, then you KNOW what the great second season of WH was all about! This show really hit it's stride around 1977-78.

My title refers to the classic episode where Rerun joins a ridiculous cult where he worships a head of lettuce named ""ralph."" Lots of laughs before he sees the light. (Sadly, this came out shortly before the infamous Jim Jones murders). This also includes a great knee-slapper where Dwayne does a HORRENDOUS version of ""Handyman""(Unnnhhh-Get back!). You will fall down on the floor with this one. Then there of course is the Givens Kids, who not only do ""Bubbling Brown Sugar"" (as most of the posters mention),but also a stirring rendition of ""God Bless The Child.""

WH was not great art, but it certainly made a lot of families able to sit down together and get some good hearty laughs, minus the embarrassment of the UPN, Def Comedy Jam, and ""Soul Plane"" trash of recent times.",1098144000,,916,4.648148148148148
2116305,5,B0002RQ3MU,"I have loved What's Happening since I was a kid, I'm so glad it's out on DVD now! And the second season really showcases Shirley Hemphill who I think was one of the funniest on the show! BUT, I had totally forgotten about the Givens Family and their Bubblin' Brown Sugar! Did they ever record, or does anyone know where to get old LP's of them. They were dang good! I hope they put out the third season as quickly as they got the second one out!",1098144000,,445,4.126436781609195
2116316,4,B0002RQ3MU,"What happened to Black television? Shows like What's Happening, Sanford and Son, Good Times and Martin were top-notch and hilarious for their time. Now you have to tune in to the WB or UPN Network for black-starring shows that are sometimes good, but don't stand up to the quality writing and production values of the 70's shows now coming out on DVD.

I watched What's Happening during its original run and enjoyed it thoroughly. It's great to see it on DVD, thoughtfully packaged and crystal-clear. It's a wholesome, family-orientated show with sometimes corny laughs, but always with a light pace, occasional moral message, and genuine relaxed performances...Shirley Hemphill is a natural and featured in season two more prominently.

This is a show for everybody - the cast just happens to be black. It stands up well nearly thirty years later and entertains without resorting to sexual innuendo or the 'party' lifestyle like 'The Parkers' does. Play this for your kids, nieces or grandsons, who doesn't love nerdy Rog', Re-Run's dancing or the irrepressible Dee. This is TV before it became segregated...sadly, a show like this would probably not survive today, but luckily, for a fair price, you can enjoy it anytime you want!",1097712000,3,1232,5.064039408866995

I love the one where Shirley quits Rob's Place to go work in an office. ""Watch it clown!"" Or when Momma's ex remarries and Shirely cries atthe wedding. Momma also gets a few good ones in like enacting revenge against her classmate who wants to pass his work off onto her. Dee was such the scam artist and brat, but for this we love her! After Rog, Dwayne & Rerun get A's on a class project, Dee adds: ""Triple A, well call 'em and tell them to haul Rerun away.""",1097539200,,644,4.193548387096774

But Mabel and Shirley, and Fred and dead now may the R.I.P..

They are gone but they are not forgotten their legacy will live forever. I liked this show it was so wonderful and in this second season it contains that gong show episode when Dee and Raj manages this kiddie group I used to love to see them perform that song ""Bubbly Brown Sugar"" I love it and those kids were the cutest and they could really sing I wonder if the girl is famous and if she has a singing career  she should have because she and thos boys were very talented. I liked when Wolfman Jack had called them ""Little Gladys Knight and the Pips"" I thought that was so cute . I especially enjoyed their performance at the talent show when they were singing the boys chanted"" (BE BEEP, BE BEEP)!!!! and the little girl sings a little verse of Billie Holiday Papa May Have, Mama May Have and God Bless the Child"" it was all of that I love this episode.  I love this show but this is one of my favorite ""What's Happening episodes. I just love this show and everything about it I loved all of the actors and actresses on this show they did a fine job with their acting it was wondeeful . I was too young to enjoy it when it had came on T.V. I had caught it in reruns...

So, if you enjoyed what's happening on t.v  or in rerunds then you woul definitely enjoy this dvd so therefore, I would reccommend that you buy this dvd you would definitely enjoy it!!!!!",1093996800,4,1730,4.167664670658683

8030862,4,B0002RQ3MU,"When I was growing up in the eighties, ""What's Happening"" was often shown on television. I enjoyed watching Raj, Dwayne and Rerun as three best friends in Watts, Los Angeles, California. The second season had plenty of great episodes with guests like the Doobie Brothers, Irene Cara, Debbi Morgan, Ellen Travolta, Barbara Rhoades and more. I enjoyed watching the series again with Fritzi Burr who played Raj's history teacher. She appeared in several episodes during this season.

Raj lives at home with his mother, Mabel Thomas (played wonderfully by Mabel King) and his younger sister Dee Thomas (played brilliantly by Danielle Spencer). I never knew that the actress Danielle Spencer was in a horrific car accident before the second season. If you wondered why she was always sitting down, it had to do with her recovering from the car accident. Who could forget Shirley Hemphill played Shirley Wilson, the waitress at Rob's Place soda shop, a teenage hangout.

Raj and Rerun are seniors while Dwayne is only a junior. The second season featured the original cast with Shirley Hemphill as a regular cast member. Remember when Rerun joined a cult who worshipped Ralph and a head of lettuce. Too bad, the third season was without Mabel King. She left the series because of creative differences. The show never seemed the same after she left anyway.

Sadly, the DVDs don't come with any extras or commentary on the episodes. Too bad, I loved the series and still do. There was something warm about it especially among the cast. Sadly, the world lost Mabel King, Shirley Hemphill and Fred Berry over the years.",1473724800,2,1609,4.929889298892989
