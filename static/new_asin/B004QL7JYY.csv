4445777,2,B004QL7JYY,"This is a depressing movie.  Will did an incredible job acting and the story itself was somewhat original.  However, this is far from a funny movie or a satire.  This movie is just plain sad, so it should be in the drama category.  So, if you like watching people at their rock bottom in life then you would enjoy this film, if you are like me and do not then skip it.",1315180800,2,368,4.069444444444445

4445780,4,B004QL7JYY,"""Good without the bad ain't no good at all.""  After Nick (Ferrell) gets fired from his job of 16 years he comes home to find his wife has changed the locks on his doors and all of his stuff is on the lawn.  Thinking the best way to fix things is to stay at home Nick begins his new life, living outside.  This is a very very good movie and a very different role for Will Ferrell.  While not quite as good as Adam Sandler in ""Reign Over Me"", Ferrell still shows he has what it takes to be a good dramatic actor.  There are a few funny parts in this but this is not a comedy.  It's a drama with a lot of heart and while the movie is depressing at times it is a joy to watch.  Ferrell does have some funny scenes with his own style of humor that adds to the character and watching him with the actor that plays Kenny is a treat.  This is not a typical Will Ferrell movie, but being a huge fan I loved it and look forward to more roles like this from him.  I highly recommend this.  Overall, if you like Ferrell you will like this, if you don't give this a shot still.  You may like the change.  I give it an A.

Would I watch again? - I think I would.

4445781,4,B004QL7JYY,"Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) is an alcoholic, but not of the flamboyant, fun-loving kind found in movies. Nick is simply a well-meaning, nice guy who just can't bring himself to stop drinking. Within only a few short hours, Nick loses everything because of alcoholism; first, he's fired from the job he's held for sixteen years, then he arrives home to find all of his belongings in the front yard. His wife has left him, changing the locks before her departure as well as cancelling his credit cards and turning off his cellphone service. If that's not enough, his former company repossesses his car as well. Nick is aware that he has hit rock bottom, but can think of nothing else to do except sit in his yard, in his reclining chair, and drink. Eventually, he attempts to better himself and begins by selling the belongings in his yard.

Based on a short story by Raymond Carver, Everything Must Go is so low-key and character-driven it could have been based on a stage play. Once Nick arrives home in the opening scenes, there's rarely a significant change of scenery with most scenes emphasizing character interaction rather than any type of narrative flow. While sitting on his lawn, Nick is harassed by the cops, but his A.A. sponsor Detective Frank Garcia (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) gets them off his back. Nick also befriends Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace, son of the late Notorious B.I.G.), a neighborhood boy, who helps Nick sell his stuff. There's also the new neighbor (Rebecca Hall) across the street who feels sorry for Nick, although is preoccupied with her own life.

The weight of the film falls squarely onto the shoulders of the actors, yet none of the performances are showy. No one is going to win an Oscar for their performance, although they're all stellar in a subtle way. Ferrell has cautiously approached dramatic fare before, but, without showing off, he really gets to stretch his acting chops here. Ferrell doesn't yell, overact, or have any type of violent outburst at any point. His performance is firmly grounded in reality, avoiding any and all of the wild antics that generally accompany cinematic alcoholics. He's good at playing a serious man and Nick is so normal that Ferrell effectively conveys an everyman persona that makes him easy to empathize with. From previous performances, I knew Ferrell could handle drama but he demonstrates unexpected depth here.

Meanwhile, Wallace is a very natural young actor and his character actually has a purpose in the story, rather than just appearing at the will of the script to help the protagonist. Pe&ntilde;a, who has appeared in several comedies over the last few years, has a welcome return to form in a dramatic role. I've grown used to seeing him with an over-the-top accent rather than utilizing his gift for drama that he used to make his name in Crash. All of the actors make an impression when they appear. Laura Dern has one scene in the film, as a former high-school classmate of Nick's, and it's one of the strongest performances in the film.

Everything Must Go is not like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stranger-Than-Fiction/dp/B000LXH0AE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stranger Than Fiction</a>, Ferrell's previous foray into drama. That film had a comedic tone that made it more accessible to Ferrell's typical fanbase. Don't expect much of the comedic nature from this. There are bits of downbeat comedy, but none of it is in a laugh-out-loud sort of way. There is a tone of optimism that runs through the film and a kind of natural humor that comes from the characters, but this is very much a straight-forward drama. However, there's not much dramatic conflict in the film as all the characters are generally well-meaning. It's well-handled drama, but it's as low-key as the characters that inhabit it. There's not much plot to talk about, but there is a twist late in the film that initially seems contrived, but ends up being well-handled and mostly true-to-life. What's most frustrating is that Everything Must Go walks a fine line between heavy and light drama. It's a melancholy film for sure, but it never settles on a specific tone. Even more frustrating is that it doesn't really give the characters the emotional payoff they deserve and just wraps up quickly with as little trouble as possible.

Everything Must Go has some good performances that are so calm they're the cinematic equivalent of whispering. In this respect, the performances are responsible for the makeup of the entire film, which is very calm and unassuming. Unfortunately, the film is so calm and low-key that it never becomes particularly memorable and it's highly unlikely anyone will be compelled to give it a second viewing. It's a melancholy journey that moves with emotion rather than narrative and does so almost completely in neutral.

4445782,5,B004QL7JYY,"Character. Character. Character. ""Everything Must Go"" is a methodically paced, simple story of  Will Ferrell's life unravelling suddenly and how he struggles to regain his footing in the face of enormous change. Will he go the destructive path or will he seek a new way? Ferrell shows a deeper acting ability in this movie too, much like he did in ""Stranger Than Fiction."" I love his comedic abilities, and some of them shine through in this film, but in a much more toned down way.

The cinematography makes this a pleasant movie to watch while you're enjoying the story.

Like ""Cedar Rapids"" (another movie I HIGHLY recommend), ""Everything Must Go"" saw limited release and I happened to catch it on its last weekend at our local arts theater. You probably missed it too as it only saw 245 theaters nationwide. So, do yourself a favor: get this movie. put the kids to bed, pop this in and enjoy it.",1309219200,2,899,4.6415094339622645
4445783,4,B004QL7JYY,"Will Ferrell just keeps getting better.  I believe he's one of the best actors on the big screen these days. This film is also one of the best of the year, perhaps the decade.  The filming itself is exquisite - subtle, pitch-perfect shots, some of them quite beautiful. The tone of the film is also subtle, subdued but very touching.  The plot line is imaginative and unexpected; always surprising. And it's funny!  I had two great hours watching this movie and highly recommend it to others.  I'll see it again, and I rarely see films twice.",1307145600,6,543,4.614583333333333
4445784,4,B004QL7JYY,"A businessman loses his job, and his wife kicks him out of the house, due to his alcoholism. He spends the next several days living in his front yard where he befriends a couple of his neighbors. This is an interesting, but slow-paced film that shows a man who has lost everything and doesn't know how to get his life back together. It takes place almost entirely with him in his front yard, and the highlight is the interactions he has with the people nearby that he did not previously know. This is a movie that is very well-acted, with a cast that is strongly led by the normally dreadful Will Ferrell.",1305331200,,605,4.410714285714286
4445785,3,B004QL7JYY,"I've always considered Will Ferrell's work to be somewhat of a guilty pleasure. Complaints of his comedy being stupid, childish and ridiculously over the top are completely justified, but most of it has still been relatively entertaining. His cameos are usually a bit stronger since they're right to the point and aren't force-fed to you like some of his leading roles, but films like Old School and Anchorman will always hold a special place in my heart for the kid in me that loves that nonsensical form of comedy. The few times Ferrell has ventured off into more serious territory have been pleasantly surprising. Stranger Than Fiction is probably the best example. While Ferrell's performance in the Marc Forster directed comedic drama was one of his best and the film had moments of brilliance, but it wasn't quite able to push itself into exceptionally memorable territory. Unfortunately, Everything Must Go is along the same lines.

Nick Halsey (Ferrell) is having the worst day anyone could possibly have. He loses his well-paying job of 16 years and falls off the wagon after being sober for six months. Upon returning home, he finds all of the locks and gate codes changed, a letter from his wife telling him that it's over, and all of his belongings sitting on the front lawn. If that wasn't bad enough, Nick's credit cards no longer work and he's blocked from using his joint bank account. He becomes overly possessive of, ""his stuff,"" and has no plans of ever leaving his front lawn. Detective Frank Garcia (Michael Pea), who is also Nick's AA sponsor, eventually steps in and informs Nick that a yard sale could buy him a few days before he'd eventually have to take Nick to jail. With the help of a neighborhood kid named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) whose mom is never around and a pregnant woman who just moved across the street named Samantha (Rebecca Hall), Nick eventually learns the meaning of letting go and moving on with his life.

There's a good film lying within the inner depths of Everything Must Go, but all of the decent aspects of the film feel underdeveloped and don't really have the chance to really blossom into strong characteristics or qualities to make the film great. The humor in the film is incredibly dry. Everything Must Go has a slight Lars and the Real Girl kind of feel to it without the awkwardness or strong performances to make it memorable. There are brief moments that attempt to tug at your heart strings, but it's like it all lacks follow-through. All the right elements are there, but just aren't utilized to their full potential. Most of the performances feel kind of bland. Both Will Ferrell and Rebecca Hall show shades of actually being able to portray some emotion, but just when something starts feeling like it's building to a memorable scene they fall back into ho-hum territory.

Everything Must Go isn't a happy film in the least. Nick Halsey literally has the worst week anyone could possibly imagine and just when things start to look up, he gets hit with something else. I guess the film is trying to tell you to take everything in stride, one step at a time, just deal with what life throws at you the best you can, ends lead to new beginnings, but it kind of felt like there wasn't the proper balance of hope as well. There are a few notions made that seem to hint at Nick making it through this and being a better person in the long run, but the journey in the meantime will probably leave you feeling pretty depressed.

Everything Must Go is a decent comedic drama that offers mediocrity from all sides. The most interesting aspect of the film is its premise, which the film is never fully able to capitalize on. The humor provided is more of the chuckling lightly variety instead of actually laughing out loud and everyone in the film seems to pretty much be playing the same character that's incapable of showing the actual spectrum of emotions. Everything Must Go is fairly disappointing at the end of the day, but not necessarily overly good or bad in the long run.",1305331200,24,4046,4.694366197183099

I would not recommend this, but I do believe that someone who leans more toward real life dramas would enjoy.",1500595200,,466,4.247191011235955
4445789,5,B004QL7JYY,"Channel surfing rarely has its wins.  Usually one ends up with the lesser of 200 evils.  But surfing the other day ended in a huge payoff.  Will Ferrell?  In a dramatic role??  I've never seen Ferrell play drama, so I stopped my day to watch EVERYTHING MUST GO, a tender, bittersweet comedy/drama about a man who has a very bad day--yet ends up touching the lives of at least two neighbors.

Businessman Nick Halsey (Ferrell) is a recovering alcoholic; problem is, he's just fallen off the wagon.  As a result, he's lost his cushy job, and his wife not only has left him, she's locked him out of his house and thrown all his possessions on the front lawn.  Nick's initial reaction?  To sit in his recliner on the lawn and drink himself into a funk.  But his AA sponsor (Michael Pena), a police detective, informs Nick that if he wants to live on his lawn, he has to have the pretense of a yard sale. . .and he only has five days to sell his belongings before law enforcement will interfere.  He enlists the aid of a neighbor kid (Christopher Jordan Wallace), to put up signs and negotiate with would-be buyers; and over the course of his ""sale"" he befriends his neighbor across the street (Rebecca Hall), who has marital issues of her own.  And as the story unfolds, Nick learns more about himself, about what's truly important, and who the people in his life are that really count.

Ferrell is solid in this role, but he's not humorless; there is an undercurrent of humor throughout the story.  And for this reviewer, it was surprising to see Ferrell with such range, from low-key to physical rage.  I'm too used to seeing Ferrell, in comedy after comedy, basically play the same character.  EVERYTHING MUST GO is a pleasant surprise; a rare reward for channel surfing gone right.

4445790,1,B004QL7JYY,"This movie is depressing - plain and simple. The lead character struggles with sobriety and finally sees the light at the end of the tunnel. I wanted to stop the movie at several points and just 'move on' with my own life, but was hoping for a better ending. It never comes, instead its a semi-happy ending with him seeing the error in his ways.",1498953600,,345,4.323076923076923
4445791,5,B004QL7JYY,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to the protagonist so much.  Not a Will Ferrell fan, but this is arguably my favorite movie of his (the other being the equally awesome Stranger Than Fiction).  I don't get the low ratings, I guess others were expecting a typical Ferrell lowbrow mainstream Hollywood comedy?  But yeah, this is so much more up my alley.  Can relate so much in my life right now.  They really took the Raymond Carver short story this is based on and ran with it.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,1537,4.582417582417582

I loved this movie and could watch it numerous times.  I would like to see him in more roles where he plays more of a interesting character vs a doofus--albeit an obnoxious lovable doofus. This is not your typical Will movie, and I loved seeing him branch out to play a more ""real"" character.  I see there are many who rated this with low stars, but I believe this is a movie you need to see and judge for yourself.  If you are a fan of Mr. Ferrell and would love to see him break out of self-deprecating roles, then this is a good start--both for the viewer and for him.  I think he is one talented guy, and the powers to be just don't know how to utilize his capabilities.  I say ""well done.""",1493251200,4,851,4.096385542168675

Everything Must Go is more of a drama with humor than an actual comedy, and Ferrell manages the tough task of making us care for a character who is not only a loser, but also a bit of a reprobate. Fans expecting another Ron Burgundy or Ricky Bobby may be sorely disappointed, but anyone looking for a character study in the comedy of real life will find this a to be a satisfying couple of hours.",1489536000,3,562,4.212962962962963

4446265,4,B004QL7JYY,"I agree with the other reviews who indicated that the negative reviews of this film are likely due to people expecting a comedy rather than a drama, because this film is an unmistakably dramatic role for Will Ferrell, and he's quite good in it.  He is very credible as a jobless, homeless, divorced drunk.  In fact, the film allows you to develop empathy for this character who clearly dug his own hole.  However, a few things were a bit off the mark.  It was not clear why and how the role of the young child came in.  It seemed a little too contrived for this boy to befriend him.  Also, it was unclear why his company car was taken when he supposedly had until the end of the month.  I don't recall it being specified that it was so close to the end of the month.  Lastly, the part about the woman having also made threats to sue prior companies (presumably due to sexual harassment) did not sit well with me, because it suggested that if a woman invokes more than one lawsuit for a company or for sexual harassment that she is no longer credible, which is not an accurate representation of women since so many legitimate law suits against companies go unfiled.  Nonetheless, that was a very small element in the film, and overall, it was a good movie.  Kudos to Will Ferrell for stepping out of his comfort zone and doing such a great job in this role!",1483401600,5,1356,4.366533864541832

Overall its a pretty sad story about what a man can come down to after being (self) inflected with some life changing catastrophies.

There's a hapless kid in it too who trys to help him out but who gets treated a bit harsh - reminded me a lot of the kid in Bad Santa..

4446944,3,B004QL7JYY,This slow moving glimpse into the life of an alcoholic has a very measured patter that engages you to the end only because you are waiting for the climax that never comes. I was really hopeful that the next scene would bring more depth to the movie and characters and stories and it simply never happened. There are some moments that are light but I believe this was just an exercise to help Will learn how to be more of a serious actor than anything else. It was simply ok for the investment of time if there is nothing else to watch. IT's not a comedy and more of an incomplete melodrama.,1476144000,,590,4.276785714285714

This movie had a great ending when mostly this disease ends badly for most alcoholics. I was moved by his passion for the role and I became a believer in that this disease doesn't just cherry pick the bums in the slums.

4447640,1,B004QL7JYY,"I would not consider this a comedy movie. It's about a man you gives up on life and doesn't really do anything about it. I have always enjoyed Will Ferrel movies but this movie is defiantly the worst I've seen. It is very depressing throughout and does not ever come to a resolution, so it fell like you've just wasted 2hrs of your life.",1467936000,,337,4.28125

4447648,4,B004QL7JYY,"Will Ferrell does a fine job of portraying a man who has let his alcoholism lose him his job, wife and soon home. In order to live in his front yard (since he has nowhere else to go), for five days he has to pretend to be having a yard sale. A young boy in the neighborhood befriends him. A young pregnant woman across the street keeps an eye on him. His sponsor checks in on him. This is not deep and dark, though his situation is. There is a wry sense of humor and his character is such a decent man you want him to succeed. I am glad to have watched this film, and if I ever meet Will Ferrell this is the film I will ask him about.",1467763200,,634,3.8473282442748094

My guess is that the low star-count for most of these reviews are based on the expectation that because Will Ferrell is in it, it is going to be Step Brothers-esc. That is not the case and I like it that way. This movie is on par with some of my other favorites that I would lump into this same category: Up in the Air; The Descendants; About Schmidt. Will Ferrell shows some impressive range in this one and it is a top 150 film for me. I watch a lot of films so this is saying something.",1466985600,,539,4.046728971962617

Also, the house was not foreclosed or anything, so why didn't he break in?  Plus, she left expensive Koi fish in the converted swimming pool pond to basically fend for themselves too.

But I suppose that's the mark of a good story, it sucks you in - suspension of disbelief. I'm a sucker for Rebecca Hall (Is it my imagination or does Will Ferrell get some awesome female co-stars in his dramatic films? R. Hall, Maggie Gyllnhall, Rhada Mitchell!) so even her incredibly unlikely involvement with such a nut job neighbor is overlooked (by me) and I'm rooting for her to help fix Ferrell's character. Also a big fan of Michael Pea, made me interested in what his character was up to. And the heart of the movie, Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace).
Maybe it's more like a fairy tale, and I like fairy tales.",1466294400,,742,4.544776119402985

However, I've got to say we were pleasantly surprised by this film. This movie has an unusual rhythm that is quite refreshing and draws the viewer in the more you watch. It quickly sets the stage and provides the audience with context to real life issues while weaving in bits of humor to keep things moving along. Multiple story lines of neighbors, particularly a young neighborhood boy that Will befriends, keeps you invested in the movie and wondering how these snapshots of real life themes will play themselves out. We found this movie very interesting and for the most part fairly clean to watch. Definitely something you won't feel you've wasted your time investing in.",1465603200,,793,4.795620437956204

It isn't a pretty film. It's a realistic look at what alcoholism can potentially do. The five star comes not from the pedestrian tale, but from the ability of these actors to underscore how much basic humanity means to each of us. Life is worth living even in its bleak hours.

4447895,5,B004QL7JYY,"1. This movie was gripping. An all too realistic peek behind the curtain of the inner workings of a guy who has a pretty bad week and briefly loses his grip on the first half of the description 'functional alcoholic.'

2. That said, while it has some pretty nice moments, I found the emotional payoffs for the most part to ring false. They struck me as somewhat artificial and unearned. The protagonist takes a detour about midway through the film in order to have an ancillary character randomly drop in and pronounce the message of the film out loud. The relationships he develops seem arbitrary.

3. I think I'd give this movie about three and a half stars. STUPENDOUS performance from Ferrell, but it just never delivers the emotional resonance I think it thinks it has.

4. I'm giving it 5 stars here explicitly to balance out the avalanche of negative reviews from people too dull to read the description who just assume it's full of fart jokes and one-liners. Which it is not. Just 2 days ago some leading light published the following review: ""This was a terrible movie. It was supposed to be a comedy, but I just found it sad. Awful."" Which, I think, speaks for itself as to the intellectual capability of its unfortunate author, and is an unfair (obviously) treatment of a flawed but compelling film.",1464912000,,1310,4.662337662337662

4448048,4,B004QL7JYY,I have come to not care for Will Ferrell over the years because of his constant use of the F word and seeing his naked behind in most every movie. A good movie does not need a bunch of curse words nor nudity.  I had this movie in my queue for a while before finally deciding to give it a try. Well I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think there was any curse words and no nudity. It was just a very good movie about a man that lost his job and his wife on the same day and him just doing what he has to do to make it through the day. He is a recovering alcoholic and this sent him back to drinking but by the end of the movie he has made new friends and has changed in a good way. Give it a try I think you will like it. There is no slapstick comedy or violence but just a really good movie.,1462492800,,792,3.7425149700598803
4448049,2,B004QL7JYY,I'm sorry. I just couldn't get over the fact that any man that came home to find the situation that he did would have broken a window and moved all his stuff back into his house. Seriously? He just takes that from his bitch of a wife? Why? Dumb premise. Dumb movie.,1462492800,,265,4.115384615384615

Maybe because I'm going through some life changes of my own, and found it inspiring how he navigated through a necessary purged the universe forced upon him. He was asked to changed and didn't, so change was brought to him.. Universe has a way of doing that. I though Ferrell was really great as a serious actor, and the kid who played Kenny was amazing! He seriously needs to be in more films. I googled and his name is Christopher Jordan Wallace, the son of the late Notorious B.I.G. and his mother is singer Faith Evans.

This was under the category of ""comedy"" but really this is not a comedy at all it is drama, and fairly decent drama.  I wonder if Will Ferrel does movies like this to try and keep more avenues open for his career, then because he is in them they get labeled comedy anyways.",1460505600,,349,4.3538461538461535
4448203,4,B004QL7JYY,"Will Ferrell steps outside of his comfort zone and hits a homerun.  I am reminded of Meg Ryan's outside-the-box venture in ""When A Man Loves A Woman"".  The thing about comedians playing it 'straight' in a drama... We never expect it... We don't see it coming... We don't know how to feel about it and yet... They do it so well, when they do.  It's a realistic and depressing look at a depressing but real problem facing far too many people.  Those who have watched a loved one go through it and those who have lived it will feel more than a twinge of sadness and empathy (respectively) for this poor man.  Even though his problems were self-inflicted, his misfortune is still a blow to the gut for anyone with a heart.  It's not a happy movie but there are some sweet and caring moments between him and his young protege.  It's a really well acted movie and has it's place.  I liked it very much.  Even if it didn't make me feel better or laugh much.

As a side note... I, for one, am glad to not have had to see Mr. Ferrell's bare backside for a change.  Although there were some disturbing moments involving the neighbor's bedroom behavior and too many scenes of men relieving themselves(and why people feel the need to put such scenes in ANY movie is a sick mystery to me)

The movie seems, sometimes, disjointed, but maybe it was intentional as a reflection of the disjointed life and behavior of a true alcoholic.  It's not a feel good movie in any sense, but it is a direct and compassionate one.  If you are looking to be impressed by Mr. Ferrell's acting chops, this is it.  If you are looking to watch something to keep you away from the bottle... This is NOT it.  It's too depressing.  An alcoholic would just want to have a drink to ease the pain of watching his.",1460419200,5,1774,4.359756097560975

Adam Sandler and Jim carry can do it but this was jus sad to watch. Terrible plot his sponsor is cheating on his wife what happens to the black kid and what was the point of Delilah. Too many stupid subplots and ending doesn't make any scense. This is the WORST Will Ferrell movie of all times should have know when my library has 10 copies and no one is checking it out. Will never get back that 1 hour and 30 mins. I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE OF CRAP.,1459123200,,593,4.076923076923077

Would rather wait in line for a porta potty on a Nevada highway in 101 degree heat for 1 1/2 hours than to ever be subject to such poorly written, poor filmed, poorly directed, bad story pieces of s***. Will Ferrell is a bad actor period (knew that going in - but had fingers crossed that it might be sufferable)  he does not just play an idiot in his films, he must be one in life in my opinion to do such rolls. This needs erased from all electronic digital recordings and then thrown out so future generations never have to see such a film or find it in the trash.

4448407,2,B004QL7JYY,"A somewhat interesting tale about a man who can't catch a break in life; the movie begins with him being told by his company that he's a liability and that he's being let go, and then he returns home to find that his wife has changed the locks and put all his belongings on the lawn, that a hold has been put on his bank account, and to add insult to injury his car, apparently a company car, is repossessed with some of his belongings still in it. Without any transportation, any funds to deal with his current dilemma, or any social support he is then subjected to what appears to be a total community coup to attack him; he's constantly being told he needs to leave, having neighbors call the cops on him, all who don't seem to understand that he has no means by which to even fulfill their somewhat unrealistic expectations given the circumstances. Will Ferrell does a good job portraying a character who is aware that he has problems but is otherwise put in the position of being a scapegoat for what? Something that is unclear. This is perhaps a compelling portrait of what some of middle America experiences when we rob citizens of real life and real problems, and their reaction is simply ""we want it to go away"" and when corporate types travel around, not engaging with communities, yet said communities are called upon to engage with certain social structures. This is embodied well by a scene in which the employee who let Will Ferrell's character go runs into him at a restaurant and says ""well, if you hadn't done this, you could've gotten your job back,"" as if that was made clear from their meeting. Imaginary or unsaid understandings between people is definitely an understated theme. It was still a somewhat depressing movie which scratched the surface of some of the themes I've outlined above, and without a satisfying solution.",1457308800,,1847,4.651376146788991

For a slightly dark feel good comedy, it does just that, and follows the short story it was based off of very well as far as the lessons portrayed, ""I am no different than any of you, other than i can get rid of everything that holds me back to break free and move on.""
Not all movies are going to be what people expect them to be, but more what the directer wants it to be. 90% of these reviews are nothing more than personal biased opinions probably expecting Will Ferrel to be more like he is in his other movies, rather than a non bias judgement based on how the movie's story was portrayed and delivered as the director intended.

Not one of Will Ferrel's best efforts. We couldn't even make it to the end of the movie!

He's a bit stiff in this role, but I give him points for taking on a difficult character whose development happens in very small increments. In this film, in contrast to Ray Carver's short story, most of the drama is situational, rather than character-based.

I'd like to see Will Ferrell work on his serious acting, as I think he has tremendous potential. And he must be tired of all those formulaic comedies, even as they make good money.",1453680000,,505,4.804597701149425

No one seems to understand that he is an actual actor. Now that I have gotten that out of the way... This is an amazing movie that, it is not funny, it is not a comedy, this is a serious drama about a man battling alcoholism, divorce, and losing his job, who has to live on his front lawn and try to sell all of his belongings so he can get on with his life. He is helped by his friend Kenny and together they try to sell his stuff. This is a drama, which is something I can not stress enough because the amount of 1 star reviews about how unfunny this movie is, boggles my mind, while yes this movie does have a couple (two to three) funny moments, all dry humor, the movie is a drama. This is an incredible movie if you have any time, you should use it to watch this movie. Will Ferrell is so great in this movie that he has gained my respect as a serious actor. It is crazy to watch this movie and then think about Zoolander 2, the fact that he can be so good in both roles in both movies is great.

I'll be honest, I didn't read any of the reviews, so I should have been more prepared for the fact this was not a comedy, but I've got quite a bad cold and I couldn't be bothered. I nearly turned it off because I wasn't really in the mood for something darker with my bad cold, but I'd already turned off 'The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain' and some other tosh about a lady who doesn't like Valentine's Day, so I thought I'd throw caution to the wind.

It's not a bad film. There's not much more to add to the story than the synopsis, really. The acting's quite good. If there was any 'light humour', I didn't really get it, but that might be because of my bad cold. I did wonder a few things though, like ""How come he is not allowed access to his own house and money?"" and ""Why doesn't he just move his stuff round the back and live under one of the fish-tents?"" but I suppose that would have lessened the point of the film somewhat.

It's probably worth a watch. It's not really 'feel good', so I wouldn't put it on if you've drunk half a bottle of gin. Or you've got a bad cold.",1453161600,2,1128,4.053811659192825

4449404,5,B004QL7JYY,"I've been putting off watching this because the cover alone seems depressing, and while I wouldn't call this a happy or upbeat movie I am glad I finally watched it. I noticed that most of the negative reviewers went into the film expecting it to be a comedy and another reviewer said it well, something like, ""It's not a comedy but it has comedic moments."" Ferrell's character is witty and the circumstances are painfully comedic (or is it comically painful?) at times but you will probably not enjoy this movie if you are expecting a typical comedy or for Will Ferrell to play one of his typical goofy, larger than life characters. The plot unfolds in the span of five days so this is also not a movie with sweep-you-off-your-feet changes in circumstance or dramatic endings. It's a pretty evenly paced glimpse of one man's final descent to rock bottom and the very early stages of his journey back up. In the grand scheme of the main character's life, it's really a very brief snapshot, but there are lots of subtle and significant realizations that occur that make this movie thought-provoking and, ultimately, heart-warming. There is a bevy of surprisingly endearing supporting roles that come into play with Ferrell's situation in impactful ways which add a lot of interest and variety to the story. Unlike other movies that have morose themes, I think what keeps this movie from being overly depressing was the setting and scenery. Set in Arizona, there is lots of sunlight and color. It's almost ironic how cheerful some of the surroundings are when paired with the main character's bleak circumstances. Whether or not that was intentional, it made a big difference for me. Overall I really liked this movie. It felt genuine and relatable and (spoiler alert:) it ends hopefully. Not happily, but hopefully. And sometimes I really enjoy a movie that just HINTS at a happy ending instead of throwing it right in my face just to wrap things up. There are a handful of movies that deal with the harder things of life that I was glad to watch once and appreciated for what they were but that I wouldn't really want to watch again. Everything Must Go a movie that has enough wit and borderline charm that I actually enjoyed watching it and would watch it again. Heads up: there's one scene in which the main character witnesses his neighbors performing some sort of BDSM sex act but I don't think it involved full nudity of either the man or woman (they are dressed in erotic leather outfits). Though it was brief, I wish they would have just left it out as it bumps the movie into a different rating (in my opinion). It gets five stars from me for it's realistic perspective on the deeply significant, but not fatalistic, impact of the choices we make in life and how powerfully people influence each other, for better or worse.",1451865600,18,2830,4.707661290322581

Usually when you see his name though, you instantly think ""goofy, gut busting, over-the-top comedy film"", but this was definitely the opposite of that. This film really showed the range of his acting skills. The overall tone of this movie reminds me of Silver Linings Playbook starring Bradley Cooper (another movie that I enjoyed).
I can definitely see why this is categorized as a ""Comedy-Drama"", because there are some funny moments, but for the most part it touches on certain serious, relatable issues that some people face. I do feel like they could've cut down on the front lawn scenes a bit, and went into more detail about Ferrell's character background, rather than just his vices. By the end of the movie you forget that it's Will Ferrell playing this character, which is a good indication that he did a great job at selling his role in this.

Will Ferrell took a risk doing such an unusually serious role, but I believe it payed off. If you are expecting a laugh out loud comedy you will be disappointed.

She's locked him out of the house and disappeared, leaving Nick camping out among his stuff on the grass.

Movies like this are small. Small things are tough to make because you can't hide bad acting or shotty camera work. Every shot is crafted. The script needs to be strong. Small things are precious and hard to find, like a good Will Ferrell movie.

Movies like this remind me that there are still good film producers out there. Stranger Than Fiction is one of my favorites. This is not as good but it was worth the unique story. They made living on the front lawn interesting. Good job!",1447804800,,602,4.2631578947368425
