8249251,5,B00135D94U,"Demon Beast Invasion is one of those hentais that had a steady fan base, but never really caught on compared to the heavier doses of your average spiritual splatter gore horror movie mixed with otherwise awkward, but artistically unique sexual themes. Personally, I never was able to get in to the series as a whole because it remained inconsistent in many ways while possessing a boring repetitious story line and predictable outcomes and after a few sequels I kept thinking there was no more hope for it, especially when I found the final episode in the series because no matter what, the last episode of nearly every hentai anime is ALWAYS the lamest episode.

Well you know what? I actually can't say that about this addition. In fact, it's probably the best episode in the Demon Beast Invasion series! Its sexual themes stay consistent and the bounty of naughty, surprisingly NON-violent tentacles is amazingly huge; it actually has a sense of limitation!

Even better is that the story continues off of the original Demon Beast story line and while it remains a repeat of the usual problems the heroes face and how they resolve the issue is down right predictable as it has been since episode 2, the story this time actually tries something so new and different in a hentai alone that it actually becomes one of the best sub-plots in an all ready derivative plot line I've ever encountered! There was such a unique balance in this episode I still can't believe it!

You might not know what's going on in this episode if you end up buying it first or this one only, but even if that is the case, get it because it may just be the best of the six Demon Beast Invasion episodes ever made. Ever. Yosh.",1210723200,2,1703,4.6138613861386135
