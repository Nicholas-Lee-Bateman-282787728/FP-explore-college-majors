8339866,1,B001ACY8H8,"Nicely packaged with an outline available at [...] but a real disappointment.

Dr. Fruchtenbaum possesses a rich background,  which was why I bought the study.  According to Wikipedia:

""Fruchtenbaum was born in 1943 in Siberia, Russia. The family escaped to Germany in 1947 after his father had been accused of being a Nazi spy. At age 13, Fruchtenbaum came to believe that Jesus was the Messiah. His father opposed this and forbade him to read the Bible, attend meetings, or otherwise meet with Messianic Jews. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1958.

After being forced to leave the family home, in 1962 he began college education at Shelton College in New Jersey. He moved to Cedarville College in Ohio, where he graduated with a BA degree in Hebrew and Greek in 1966. He then moved to Israel, where he studied archeology, ancient history, historical geography, and Hebrew at the American Institute of Holy Land Studies and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. During this time, he witnessed the Six Day War in 1967.""

With this wealth of life at his disposal, how could he not be a great speaker?  I don't know.  He seems to be reading from an an outline and won't  come up for air.  If you are looking for war stories, lessons, illustrations, and strength for the day, look elsewhere.

Stranger still, for believing in Christ, he doesn't seem interested in finding the New Testament  in the Book of Ezekiel.  Example:  In his line by line exposition of Ezekiel 11:14-21 (""one heart""...""new spirit"")  he did not once mention the New Testament or Jesus Christ.  I was stunned.  I bought the set hoping to use them in a Sunday School study of the Book of Ezekiel but I don't think the discs will be usable.

The production values are OK, you can hear and see him clearly, but the camera is fixed in one position dead on him. I did not see the audience, or hear their questions.  To their credit the producers have posted the audience questions at the bottom of the screen.

He spends some time speculating on ""prophecy"" and the role of the British Commonwealth of Nations and America.  For people taking that approach to prophecy, the series may be more attractive.

If you like a learned line by line commentary of sections of the Book of Ezekiel, but little audience interaction, and little application, buy this DVD.  I wish Dr. Fruchtenbaum would cause breath to enter these dry bones and make them live.",1235606400,11,2411,4.701670644391408
