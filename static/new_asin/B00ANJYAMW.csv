5460486,2,B00ANJYAMW,"I love taking sculpt classes at CorePower, so I was really excited to get this.  However, this DVD was too slow and not at all comparable to studio classes.  What a disappointment.",1380672000,7,180,4.59375
5460487,5,B00ANJYAMW,I love this workout. Excellent work out really burns! Recommend it to anyone who loves yoga and wants a little challenge.,1377734400,,121,4.809523809523809
5460488,5,B00ANJYAMW,"I enjoyed the yoga work out, and learning something new, that helps with breathing & flexibility.

I choose the particular work out I need for each morning.",1373328000,3,156,4.777777777777778
5460489,5,B00ANJYAMW,Instructor is fantastic and it is a great DVD to use at home when I don't have time to take a class,1366156800,5,99,3.5454545454545454
5460490,5,B00ANJYAMW,"I watched the ""Sneak Peek"" a few times and I could tell it is beautifully  done. The DVD offers 3 routines. I love that I can play it at home and practice when I am able to practice. I am able to follow which is rewarding. I bought several for friends and bought 3 additional copies. I am telling all my friends to buy this DVD at Amazon.com.

Thank you,

Kathleen",1365897600,5,364,4.098591549295775
5460491,5,B00ANJYAMW,"This is a great option for those of us who don't have a yoga studio near by.
I recently moved to PA from CA for grad school and dearly miss attending C2  and Sculpt classes at CorePower.
While I do miss being in the heated room, I have nothing but good things to say about this at home DVD.
Definitely give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",1454284800,9,343,4.044117647058823
5460492,5,B00ANJYAMW,"Great yoga DVD, challenging for me and was sore next day which I love",1450137600,,69,4.0

5460494,5,B00ANJYAMW,"I loved going to hot yoga classes at the CorePower studio, but it's just too expensive now. But no other class or yoga dvd quite did it for me, until I stumbled upon this and in a word...bliss. The queuing is spot on, the flow and timing, the engaging simplicity. It's by far my favorite. And I love that I can do 20 min chunks or let it all flow into a full hour when I have more time.",1435536000,11,386,3.8987341772151898
5460495,5,B00ANJYAMW,Great workout ! The instructor is pleasant and the moves are not too awful but challenging for someone not very flexible.,1426377600,4,121,4.809523809523809
5460496,5,B00ANJYAMW,love it !!!,1421366400,,11,3.0
5460497,4,B00ANJYAMW,I like this dvd.  The instruction is good and it's a good workout.,1416614400,,66,4.076923076923077
5460498,5,B00ANJYAMW,I have been doing yoga at a gym for the last two years and when the instructor moved I needed a similar program to do at home. This is it! This video is probably best for someone already familiar with the poses. I wanted a challenge and got it with CorePower.,1395100800,5,259,4.098039215686274
5460499,2,B00ANJYAMW,I bought this because I was looking for a short yoga sequence I can do after work that actually makes me sweat.  This does not do that.  I bought it and I use my other yoga dvd's instead so I can actually burn calories.  I would not buy again.,1394928000,3,243,3.9183673469387754
5460500,5,B00ANJYAMW,I have started practice of yoga and this is one of the video which sets my pace. I would recommend anyone to try it.,1394323200,3,116,3.875
8554756,1,B00ANJYAMW,"This DVD flow moved much too quickly. Additionally, I found the rapid progression to backbends with inadequate warm up time very irresponsible. As someone who lives in a rural area who doesnt have access to CorePower Yoga classes but wanted to experience it, this was very disappointing. The instruction was jilted and awkward, and the set was dated.",1526342400,,350,5.051724137931035
8554757,1,B00ANJYAMW,Just didn't like it.,1513987200,,20,4.25
8554758,3,B00ANJYAMW,"Very slow-paced and not quite the workout I was hoping. The abdominal/core section was a little more challenging, but overall this is really not a workout. Get the Biggest Loser Yoga workout or Jillian Michaels Yoga Inferno instead of younreally want to feel you pushed your muscles. I donated this to my local library.",1507420800,,319,4.925925925925926

8554761,4,B00ANJYAMW,I have already started to use this DVD and it is a beginners yoga and is very good.,1483228800,4,83,3.6666666666666665
8554762,3,B00ANJYAMW,Nice addition to my home workout collection.,1475712000,2,44,5.428571428571429
8554763,5,B00ANJYAMW,"A great video to make your body work! I like that it has three 20-minute segments, with a bonus 10 minute segment focused on core. The third 20-minute segment includes a pair of 3 lb weights, which ups the ante a bit. In all, by doing the whole video, you'll get a 70 minute workout. I like the instructor (tho she seems a bit touchy feely with the students which makes me laugh a little). Good video.",1473811200,3,401,4.220779220779221
8554764,2,B00ANJYAMW,I love core power and hoped this would be a substitute for the class and it is so boring and slow.,1468972800,,98,3.7142857142857144
8554765,5,B00ANJYAMW,"I love this yoga inspired DVD.  I say this because there are moves incorporated in this DVD which are not totally yoga moves/poses.  This DVD is broken into 3 twenty minute sections, so that you can do what you want/have time for.  There is also a mini abs workout which is great if your time is really limited.  The reason why I loved this DVD is that there is a sculpt section which uses weights while in yoga poses.  This allows me to do both yoga and weight training at the same time.  Another really important feature of this DVD is that the instructions are both clear and easy to follow without having to look up at the screen...",1464220800,2,636,4.302521008403361
