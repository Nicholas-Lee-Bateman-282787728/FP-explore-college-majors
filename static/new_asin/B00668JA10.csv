4961973,5,B00668JA10,"I did not intend to upgrade my Harry Potter collection from DVD to Blu-ray until this ""Double Header"" collection came along. This is such a great bargain; why do they even still offer the films separately? These editions contain all the special features found on the two DVD editions.

I'm sure you're familiar with the films themselves, but if not: Prisoner of Azkaban is my personal favorite. Werewolves, time-travel, shape-shifters, wrongfully imprisoned convict escapes ... what else could you ask for? This duo of films marks the transition within the Harry Potter series from children's stories to something more sinister.",1361059200,8,628,5.28
4961974,5,B00668JA10,"Good extras, and excellent quality at a good price. Make sure to watch the added scenes in the extra features.",1360022400,3,110,4.55
4961975,5,B00668JA10,"I am not familiar with the Harry Potter stories, but I do know that my granddaughter really enjoyed them and she has requested the movies on her wish list.",1426204800,,155,4.379310344827586
4961976,4,B00668JA10,I bought the DVD Special Ed versions of these movies years ago and wanted to upgrade to Blu-Ray.  I like that most of the extras from the DVDs are on these Blu-Rays.  Now instead of two disks per movie I have one.  That helps the size of my collection.,1425513600,,252,4.1020408163265305
4961977,2,B00668JA10,"The HP movies themselves are great. These movies are not. I purchased the double feature HP blu-rays on black Friday (1&2, 3&4, 5&6, 7p1&7p2). They were all coming from the same place, Amazon LLC, and my husband and I have started a potter-thon.  HP 1-4 were fine, however, popping in year 5, suddenly it's bugging out.

These movies have never been watched, we just took the plastic off now, 4 months later. And it's like the disc set has been used and returned. The discs inside do not even match up.

Example - OOTP simply states the movie title while HBP states 'disc 1 movie' when technically it's the second disc in that particular set.",1425081600,,642,4.565217391304348

4961990,5,B00668JA10,"Had all the Harry Potter movies already and just wanted 1-4 on BluRay (already had the last ones). I like that this came as a set of two and you can SERIOUSLY notice the difference in picture quality between the DVD version and BluRay version. If you have a good screen and love Harry Potter, it's worth the investment.",1410134400,2,319,4.423728813559322

4961996,5,B00668JA10,"The description says that there are no special features on this dvd. I've only watched Prisoner of Azkaban and there were all kinds of special features, assuming there are on goblet of fire too, but there for sure is on prisoner.",1398297600,2,229,4.609756097560975

4961998,5,B00668JA10,"I was amazed at how quickly this shipped. The blu ray has fantastic picture quality and I love that it has some of the features of the dvd on it. I own all the Harry Potters on dvd, but I figured it was time to update to Blu Ray so I went with what was cheap and efficient and honestly, this surpassed all my expectations.",1397692800,,322,3.9692307692307693
4961999,5,B00668JA10,The double feature was a good price for Blu-Ray and was great quality.  Glad that there was the option of scene selection so we could pause the movie and go back to it at a later time. It worked great. Thanks!,1394755200,,209,4.097560975609756
4962000,5,B00668JA10,"If you are a Harry Potter movie fan you may appreciate, as I did, getting two blu ray movie discs, in this case Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, for less than the price of one and in only one case. Not only is the blu ray edition an upgrade in picture and sound quality (excellent in both cases) from my DVD editions but taking less space on the shelf I consider is a nice bonus. While I am not a huge fan of any movie's special features, these discs contain the same ones as did the DVDs, so if you are looking for more hours of features you may want to consider the pricier blu ray/DVD Hogwarts collection (with 37 hours of specials). But, if you are just in the market for very good quality Azkaban and Goblet blu ray movies that will also save some space on your shelf these are what you want to get.",1392076800,7,811,4.1069182389937104

4962002,5,B00668JA10,The HP books are awesome... granted the movies don't do the books justice but they are still extremely good movies.,1385856000,,115,4.8
4962003,5,B00668JA10,"Was nice to get two movies for a better price. Have the special feature disk on dvd. Hate that I have a minimum of words on this post just to help someone that I have no idea who that could be thinking about buying this double feature that is well worth it and don't know why I just cant tell you that in the first sentence. Hope you all enjoyed my attempt to fill this review with words that did not need to be here but you all will enjoy the movie and the price, but lets not forget that I have to tell you this with more words that you need to hear. Hope you all have a wonder time watching these movies. Good day, or maybe good night.",1377734400,2,638,3.9153846153846152

8493806,1,B00668JA10,I purchased all of Harry Potter's videos a year ago because it was a great deal and finally got around to viewing the Goblet of Fire. I opened the wrapper and put in the blu ray and watched it until it got to the part of the movie when the champions went to the ball. The video froze and this is a brand new blu ray so I tried to go back to the main menu to click on scene selections but it wouldn't allow me. I ended up ejecting the video and restarted it. I clicked on scene selections and tried to get a scene that followed the ball scene but nothing came up. The video was blank. I was very disappointed because I knew I couldn't return an item I bought a year ago. My advice would be to play every video you buy within the 30 days just to see if it works!,1440460800,,760,3.878205128205128

 Although the packaging spokes for one of the discs was busted. So it won't stay in place and will probably scratch the disc",1439942400,,148,4.481481481481482
8493808,5,B00668JA10,Love the double feature on the Harry Potter movies.  I wasn't sure based on some of the reviews if it would work on my Blu-Ray player.  It worked great.  My oldest daughter is just getting into the Harry Potter series and loved both movies.,1435881600,,240,4.409090909090909
