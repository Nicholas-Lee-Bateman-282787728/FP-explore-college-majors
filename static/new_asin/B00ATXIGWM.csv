5510019,1,B00ATXIGWM,"Cannot recommend this movie. Bad story, bad acting, very slow start to the action scenes and the Kung Fu scenes are mediocre at best. The scene where the dog is hit by a car and the boy just walks away without helping the dog is kind of weird. The romance with the European reporter was bizarre and the ending made no sense at all. Bad movie. Maybe rent it thats about it. A great martial arts movie to buy is ""The Raid"" or any of the ""IP Man"" movies.",1364428800,3,451,4.078651685393258
5510030,4,B00ATXIGWM,"All in all not a bad solo film to start for Jon Foo. The fight scenes were done very well, especially the fight in the subway. All though there were a couple of fights that seemed to be hidden from full view. For example, shadows of a fight in progress were shown on the side of a wall instead of actors themselves.

You can definitely tell that Tony Jaa had an influence on this film as he does with others; however when you start dodging swinging baseball bats on top of parked cars then it becomes much more obvious. I do have to give Jon Foo credit, he has the necessary skills to perform every move and stunt so easily.

The acting department on this film was a bit below average and the only thing he is in need of mastering. But again this is his very first starring role so the expectation in that area is not as high and can only really be expected to improve as time continues. I really hope to see more of him, it would be nice to add a new face to the roster of new generation martial arts movie stars.",1396051200,,1014,4.116161616161616
5510031,3,B00ATXIGWM,"If you have seen Tekken, a film adaptation of video game, you may remember the name of Jon Foo, who played the hero Jin Kazama. I didn't like the film very much, but thought his martial arts skills were impressive. Now Jon Foo is back in Rebirth, a French/Thai action film, as a vengeful hero with unique traits.

The story is simple. John Foo is Manit, a young deadly martial arts fighter whose parents were brutally murdered when he was only a child. Marit, who witnessed the killing, was shot in the head by the criminal, but survived miraculously. Because of the serious wound, however, Manit has no feelings. That is, he walks, talks and fights without any emotional reaction.

The idea is interesting, but writer/director Jean-Marc Mino is not really interested in developing it. After all Rebirth (also known as Bangkok Renaissance or Bangkok Revenge) is an action movie and the film provides lots of action. Action sequences are reasonable, although more lighting and less editing would have made them better. You know Jon Foo can do action, so why don't you let him show what he can do in one continuous take?

I didn't mind the films incoherent and confusing storytelling (though the ending needs improvement). I did mind much the too fast editing that frequently undermines the action scenes. Rebirth is a solid low-budget action movie that could have been much better with more budget and more effective choreography.",1391299200,2,1429,4.896694214876033

5510033,5,B00ATXIGWM,"This movie is the exact reason I've stopped watching most everything that is out of American Hollywood. This movie makes all of the so called ""blockbusters"" or ""epics"" look like high school class projects made by people who are afraid to just grow up.

If you've never seen today's asian cinema, or think that all Chinese, Thai, and other asian films are just Kung Fu flicks with bad dubbing, then you are in for an amazing treat.

This is better than Crouching Tiger, House of Flying Daggers, or any of those other pansy-looking ""flying in the air like fairies"" -types of current asian entertainment.

Check out the film releases coming from Well Go Entertainment or Magnet. They seem to get most of the best of today's asian films.",1383264000,,733,4.7109375

5510035,2,B00ATXIGWM,"The movie starts out fairly well.  Good story line, good acting, UNTIL the blond American gal is introduced.  She's below ""B actor"" level.  I wouldn't put her in a grade school production.  Every time another American character is introduced, the movie gets worse.  It cost $3.99 to rent.  Amazon charged $200 too much.",1372550400,,319,4.9245283018867925
5510036,3,B00ATXIGWM,"Jon Foo's a good guy among the gen-x of action films, and more than anybody else, I get the impression that he's trying hard to make the most of his career and to impress people. His first starring vehicle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tekken/dp/B003ZHVJFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tekken</a>, was a mixed bag nevertheless highlighted by his martial performance, and his second solo outing, ""Bangkok Adrenaline"" here, is very similar in this equation. However, because this one has few stars in it besides him and no franchise to back it up, I believe that it's doomed to languish facelessly on the shelves of video stores. It's no help that other viewers may well judge it more harshly than I do, because while fun, this one's far from the perfect picture.

The story: after the childhood assassination of his parents leaves him impervious to pain and emotion, a fully-grown and fully-trained Manit (Foo) finds himself on his way to avenge the deaths of his mother and father at the hands of corrupt policemen.

In the movie, Manit's emotionless state is referred to as ataraxia, and I need to voice my amazement that no action star has played a character of similar affliction, since it provides an automatic excuse to not really need to act. Foo spends most of the time when he's not fighting walking around with his hands in his pockets, which is just about all he can do with this role. However, no one else in the cast is picking up the slack: virtually all of the Thai actors demonstrate difficulty with speaking English, and immediate co-stars Caroline Ducey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romance/dp/B00003JRAV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romance</a>) and Michael Cohen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Them/dp/B000X1RYEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Them</a>) don't do much better. Additionally, the storyline and pacing end up being uneven: though there are some genuinely fun diversions like the incorporation of a crazy all-girl gang, the plot doesn't always feel like it's effectively building up to a climax, and sure enough, the final scenes feel kind of lackluster. It's good that the movie only runs about 80 minutes: I'm not sure how the filmmakers would have stretched things out for even another quarter hour.

Featuring thirteen separate fight scenes, ""Bangkok Revenge"" is definitely the most ample platform to date for Foo to display his immense physical talents. At their best, the fight scenes are varied showcases for him, showing Foo capable of his great XMA stuff as well as grittier, tight-elbowed brawling. Most of his encounters are against groups of attackers, and at least one of these earns my ""very good"" rating. However, they have a tendency to fluctuate in quality, and a handful is ruined by those old eyesores of poor camerawork and choppy editing. Additionally - and we can probably blame stunt coordinator David ""Mad Dog"" Ismalone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak</a>) for this - there are a couple instances wherein the choreography genuinely seems to be lifting from Tony Jaa's material. Now, Jaa does not have a copyright on any martial arts movement, but Jon Foo looks uncomfortable using a Thai boxing style and therefore the lift is mostly unflattering.

The movie is definitely worth investigating for Jon's fans, but other viewers may feel that the world of Thailand-set films has better to offer than this. Were this the first movie for Foo to appear in, I wouldn't necessarily predict a bright future for him, but I remain hopeful that his future projects provide him with a better all-around platform.",1370217600,,3771,5.622144112478032

5510039,3,B00ATXIGWM,"Actor turned filmmaker Jean-Marc Mineo had worked on action his share of acting films.  From working on films such as """"Femme Fatale"" to coordinating action on TV series such as ""The Spear of Destiny"", Mineo has crafted his first martial arts film titled ""Bangkok Revenge"".

Starring Jon Foo (""Tekken"", ""Street Fighter: Legacy"", ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration""), Caroline Ducey (""The Soul Keeper"", ""Romance"",  ""Handicap"") and Michael Cohen, ""Bangkok Revenge"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2013 courtesy of Well Go USA Entertainment.

VIDEO:

""Bangkok Revenge"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (16:9 widescreen).  For the most part, the film does look very good, especially since many shots are outdoors.  Despite being a low-budget film, the film looks good on Blu-ray.  Skintones are natural, I expected so major noise through the more darkened scenes but nothing terrible was noticeable nor did I see any significant artifacts or aliasing.  Picture quality was very good.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Bangkok Revenge"" is presented in Thai and English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  While the film is primarily dialogue and music driven, it's primarily a front and center channel affair. I didn't notice any major use of the surround channels or LFE.  While a large part of the film is English, unfortunately it's English that is hard to understand at times that you end up watching subtitles to find out what was trying to be said.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Bangkok Revenge"" comes with a trailer.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Does anyone remember the '80s martial arts film ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" with its bad acting, martial arts action and the film that probably introduced Jean-Claude Van Damme to viewers in America?

Here comes ""Bangkok Revenge"" which features bad acting, Muay Thai Boxing and Jon Foo. But like ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" which you probably caught on HBO, you watched it probably many times because it was so bad. ""Bangkok Revenge"" makes you watch it because it's so bad,but yet it makes you laugh. It's one thing to watch a bad film that bores you, but when a bad film can make you laugh, then you know it's not that terrible. Of bad films, I probably would watch this film many times rather than watch a film like ""Strange Wilderness"" for a second time.

Granted, this is not a film you watch for great acting but for the action. And it's a popcorn action flick that you just should not dwell on and ask why?

For example, the film goes forward 20-years later but Manit who was probably 10 at the time looks more like in his younger 20s.  While his ""mother"" is seen to age, the man who brings him back to life and trains him, looks the same.

The film's pacing is off and its use of foreign actors speaking English makes the film one of the first films mostly spoken in English, where I had to have the English subtitles turned on.  The accents can be thick and even the delivered dialogue feels that the actors are trying their best to say their lines in English that it doesn't come off as natural.

From the way the film ends (why it ends that way, with another character instead of the protagonist, was just bad), to its use of almost bad ominous music during a sex scene.  When the character could have been killed and shot to death, he manages to survive with no wound.  Typically in a film, they go to explain that a bullet hit something metal that blocked the bullet penetrating but we see Manit going down but is quickly back up.

But let's eliminate the bad and think about the humor of the film, may it be intentional or not intentional.  Because Manit has no emotions, he says things that make him the ultimate smart ass.

Clara asks Manit if he ever wanted a woman to hold him in her arms and all of a sudden he says, ""I can do that"" and starts having sex with her immediately (with the ominous music playing) and her being saddened that this man can not feel pleasure.  Obviously he has to feel something to get himself in the mood for sex.

Even post-sex, he is seen giving her a pat on the shoulder and saying ""As for last night, it was great!"" with the biggest BS face you will ever see onscreen.

But there are little things such as Manit fighting a group of thugs inside the train and seeing this guy trying to film with his cell phone who gets caught up in the fracas, he ends up kicking one of the guys and you can't help but laugh.

So, there are a lot of interesting moments, dialogue and things that are flat out crazy in this film, but it's part of that charm that is reminiscent of '80s martial arts films.  Now, I don't know if filmmaker Jean-Marc Mineo set out trying to accomplish that but he did.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is good, audio was front and center-channel driven and there are no special features but a trailer.

Overall, ""Bangkok Revenge"" resembles an '80s martial arts film.  Plenty of action, uneven pacing, bad acting, corny humor but it's one of those films that can be seen as ""So bad, it's good"" that you wouldn't mind watching it again.  Of the many terrible films out there, ""Bangkok Revenge"" is not terrible and it's far from being great or even good.  But I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of those cult martial arts films that people just watch over and over.  It may be the modern equivalent to ""No Retreat, No Surrender"".",1364601600,2,5353,4.610348468848997
