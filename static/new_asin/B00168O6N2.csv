They both were fun, action packed, and very entertaining. All of the actors played their parts well. I read the mixed reviews about the second movie...Book of Secrets...so I wasn't sure if it would be as good as the first one. I'm happy to say it was just as enjoyable as the first. The blu-ray transfer is excellent and the audio sounds INCREDIBLE on my surround sound system. Especially National Treasure 2 with English Dolby TrueHD is outstanding.

3154179,4,B00168O6N2,My family loved both these movies - The blu-ray versions look great on the big screen and the acting and the storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Several times I had to remind myself to breath!  The price form Amazon was better than I found elsewhere and the quality of the DVD is excellent.

3154183,5,B00168O6N2,"I am a history buff, a Nicolas Cage fan, and an adventure lover. These are great movies that the entire family can enjoy. Historical inaccuracies aside, the bottom line is that they are just fun. A cleaner version of Indy Jones really. Don't get me wrong, nothing compares to Indy, but those movies with their adult jokes, flirting, and scary voodoo aren't really child appropriate, so it is cool to have similar movies we can all view together.",1217548800,,445,4.717948717948718
3154184,4,B00168O6N2,"Being blu-ray the quality is very good.  I always found the first National Treasure fun to watch and got a few laughs in.  As for the second one, I could hardly sit through the thing.  It was like watching a really bad version of the first one.  It stinks and I don't like it!",1216252800,,276,4.055555555555555
3154235,5,B00168O6N2,"The movie is what it is.  If you liked the 1st National Treasure, you will like this one.  I am kind of a Nicholas Cage fan since Raising AZ.
Amazon continues to deliver good value and service.  Kills me to walk thru Fry's Electronics and/or Best buy and see what others are paying for the same movies.  A LOT MORE.  The free shipping on orders > $25 is worth waiting for but most times the stuff arrives sooner than advertised.  I am also a big Amazon fan.",1216080000,,457,4.195402298850575

I bought the second movie without having seen it previously, and I am so thankful I did.  The price was also great (I purchased as a pre-order).

3154238,5,B00168O6N2,This movie was a blast and just as good as the first one. Nickolas Cage is a tremendous actor. I highly recommend this movie to any families with kids ages 7 and up!!,1215043200,,166,4.0606060606060606
3154239,1,B00168O6N2,"...with some nicely shot ads of recent Mercedes Benz, Land Rover and Ferrari models.
Other than that nothing but a confusing mix of American ""history"" with incredibly stupid fiction and overly complicated ""clues"" and riddles without the feeling that they were anyhow linked. By the end one forgets what the story initially was all about (cleaning the underwear of that grandpa who well may not existed at all).
I was so lost in how the golden city search was related to the grandpa laundry mission that I fall asleep before it turned out. Has it turned out eventually?
Boring to the bones.

The blu ray quality of National Treasure is pretty good though, so if you had no chance to buy Apocalypto yet, this one at least gives you the clue how a good blu ray movie looks like.

Otherwise avoid buying this ... hmm... title. And don't try to find director Turtlebaum at the Academy Award finals.
How on Earth anyone could give 5 stars is beyond me. I suspect Disney sells different movies in 1 and 2 region countries. Cant imagine it any other way.",1214870400,2,1046,4.588235294117647
3154240,5,B00168O6N2,"National Treasure has been amoung my most favorite movies, even have it on my Ipod Touch. Love the amount of unraveling the secret clues and twists and turns in the story. National Treasure II although not as good as the first movie still holds you in your chair to see what will come next. The ending makes you believe there mite even be a NT 3, but we will see.

Having them both on BluRay is a plus. Since I was waiting for Book Of Secrets to come out on BluRay before I purchased it and then being abel to get both in that format was excellent for those of you with HDTV and BluRay player. Strongly suggest these two movies.",1214870400,,628,4.190082644628099
3154241,4,B00168O6N2,"If you want adventurous and humorous fun in your movies, these two are your cup of tea.  With a little bit of real history thrown in, both films move
at lightning speed, leaving little time to suspend any disbelief you might have.
To be honest, I slightly prefer Book of Secrets because of the presense of the wonderful Helen Mirren, reportedly to have had the time of her life making the film and it shows.
Advice: Watch them in order.
BTW/ the Blu-Ray transfers are wonderful.",1214697600,,478,4.558139534883721
3154242,4,B00168O6N2,"The first intalment in Gates family adventures is a true masterpiece. With so many interesting puzzles and great locations together with such a great actors as Cage and Bean is a MUST.
The second part is a bit booring puzzles are dull and not even half as entertaining as a first one`s. All what left is a much much action which is hardly helping to pull it out. You can watch it for entartainment but do not hope to get the same satisfaction as watching the first part.
The Blu ray look gorgeus through and a realy must have for any HD fan.",1214611200,,541,4.262135922330097
3154243,5,B00168O6N2,I bought the package as soon as National Treasure 2 came out on Blu-Ray. I couldn't believe the price to get both of them together...it was the price of getting one at a regular store.,1214524800,,184,4.285714285714286
3154244,5,B00168O6N2,"Although the way the puzzles unfold seems a little predictable and too easily unmasked by the characters, the concept of the movie is really cool and makes you wonder about the possibility of such treasures really existing, considering the secretive and deceitful past that our country was built upon. However, I digress...

For anyone that enjoys a fast-paced adventure with a little humor here and there, it's a good addition to your collection.",1214352000,,447,5.123287671232877
3154285,5,B00168O6N2,Very good price for bluray. What can I say. Its a dvd. It worked when it arrived. It is up to you whether you like the movie but I did thats why I bought it.,1214265600,,157,3.5142857142857142
3154286,5,B00168O6N2,"I loved the original film.  It was what you would expect from a light-hearted adventure film about a history-loving treasure hunter; one who's crazy enough to do anything to protect it.

The second film is in some ways, even better than the first.  True, the aspect of history became a bit more generalized and less focused, but the character interactions and arcs were stronger this time around.  I highly recommend watching the second film, if you liked the first, as you won't be dissapointed.  A fun film is a fun film, after all.

Now, on to the blu-ray versions.  First, this package deal is great.  Buying them stand alone would cost you more than buying them in this package, so it's a bit silly for you to buy them any other way (that is, unless you already have the first one in BD).  Both film transfers are great.  Clean, sharp, and pristine.  Nothing to complain about, as Disney keep doing a great job in the HD transfer department.

It's a good buy, if you want a fun filled weekend.  A back-to-back marathon of National Treasure, with some snacks and a group of friends sounds hella fun to me.",1214265600,,1109,4.540404040404041

3154292,5,B00168O6N2,"These movies are both great in their own right, but to find them both for $39.99 as a Blue Ray set was just stellar considering in a store even a new release Blue Ray is $30.  Amazon was very professional and swift about my purchase as always.

You won't go hungry for humor or adventure with this set. The cast is very well put together and kudos to the writers for drawing us in and keeping us on the edge. Even historical buffs will enjoy these. I know because my father-in-law is and he loves them. Great for kids, my 2 girls really enjoyed watching too.

3154326,4,B00168O6N2,"So many movies are out there that are enjoyable, however, due to some content, they are not suitable for the whole family.  This series is.  It is entertaining  to see how they will use real history and make up fictional parts to really make you wonder if it could exist....  The humor infused in the ""serious"" parts make it all that more enjoyable.  A very light movie that doesn't make you think alot.... Enjoy!",1213833600,,413,4.527027027027027

They both were fun, action packed, and very entertaining. All of the actors played their parts well.

Other than that nothing but a confusing mix of American ""history"" with incredibly stupid fiction and overly complicated ""clues"" and riddles without the feeling that they were anyhow linked. By the end one forgets what the story initially was all about (cleaning the underwear of that grandpa who well may not existed at all).
I was so lost in how the golden city search was related to the grandpa laundry mission that I fall asleep before it turned out. Has it turned out eventually?
Boring to the bones.

The blu ray quality of National Treasure is pretty good though, so if you had no chance to buy Apocalypto yet, this one at least gives you the clue how a good blu ray movie looks like.

Otherwise avoid buying this ... hmm... title. And don't try to find director Turtlebaum at the Academy Award finals.
How on Earth anyone could give 5 stars is beyond me. I suspect Disney sells different movies in 1 and 2 region countries. Cant imagine it any other way.",1214870400,2,1046,4.588235294117647

National Treasure II although not as good as the first movie still holds you in your chair to see what will come next. The ending makes you believe there mite even be a NT 3, but we will see.

Having them both on BluRay is a plus. Since I was waiting for Book Of Secrets to come out on BluRay before I purchased it and then being abel to get both in that format was excellent for those of you with HDTV and BluRay player. Strongly suggest these two movies.",1214870400,,628,4.190082644628099

To be honest, I slightly prefer Book of Secrets because of the presense of the wonderful Helen Mirren, reportedly to have had the time of her life making the film and it shows.

3388783,5,B00168O6N2,"I loved the original film.  It was what you would expect from a light-hearted adventure film about a history-loving treasure hunter; one who's crazy enough to do anything to protect it.

The second film is in some ways, even better than the first.  True, the aspect of history became a bit more generalized and less focused, but the character interactions and arcs were stronger this time around.  I highly recommend watching the second film, if you liked the first, as you won't be dissapointed.  A fun film is a fun film, after all.

Now, on to the blu-ray versions.  First, this package deal is great.  Buying them stand alone would cost you more than buying them in this package, so it's a bit silly for you to buy them any other way (that is, unless you already have the first one in BD).  Both film transfers are great.  Clean, sharp, and pristine.  Nothing to complain about, as Disney keep doing a great job in the HD transfer department.

It's a good buy, if you want a fun filled weekend.  A back-to-back marathon of National Treasure, with some snacks and a group of friends sounds hella fun to me.",1214265600,,1109,4.540404040404041
