8047156,4,B0007G8NF6,One of my favorites of his. The quality is of the picture is a little off but that might have to do with the original film.,1484611200,,123,3.769230769230769

8047159,5,B0007G8NF6,"Clear picture, nice colour and editing. Much better than my copy of ""Sube y Baja"" (from a different seller) where scenes change abruptly and sound lets you down. Delivery was swift (around one week, as I remember) and package was excellent.",1415750400,,240,4.878048780487805

8047161,5,B0007G8NF6,"I just love his movies, some are alright and other hilarious. I just love the guy! Hehe. I've been ordering for my parents and they love it",1401753600,,139,4.185185185185185
8047162,4,B0007G8NF6,"The DVD is in excellent condition. I have noticed that all the Cantinflas movies ordered from the collection ""Por siempre Cantinflas"" are very good quality, and also if it is from Televisa. I have had bad experience with any other copies, which either were bad quality copies and bad sound. The movie itself is a very nice comedy. It might not be one of Cantinflas' best but it still entertaining and makes you laugh. I really enjoyed. I would definitely recommend this one.",1394064000,2,474,4.72289156626506
8047163,4,B0007G8NF6,"Though this was released in 1962, the sound recording is in mono and no English subtitles available. Regardless, I had no problem with this. The movie is entertaining and fun. Cantinflas is an ""extra"" at a studio lot for various productions. His way with words, double meanings and incomplete sentences are his trademark. When he ""dreams"", he becomes the protagonist and changes the outcome of each different scene in a hilarious way. I recommend it.",1127174400,,450,5.013333333333334
8047164,5,B0007G8NF6,In this film Mario Moreno plays a guy who practically lives on a movie set. He goes from set to set as an extra or observer but basically bothers the directors. In every set he is on he imagines himself as the main actor. He meets a young women who is an orphan along with her two younger brothers and is looking for an acting job. Cantinflas makes it a top priority to get her discovered. I wish the ending would have ended in a more romantic way but thats just my girly notions kicking in. The sound and color are pretty good. There are no special features. The movie was pretty funny; seeing cantinflas in indian and cowboys outfits gives it the fifth star. Its not his best film but its almost there.,1111622400,2,704,4.2611940298507465
