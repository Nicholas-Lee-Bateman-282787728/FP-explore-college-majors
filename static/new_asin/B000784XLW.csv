8045674,5,B000784XLW,"This was a fun movie until the last five or six minutes when it got a bit silly but I felt that wasn't bad enough to lose a star, thus the five stars. A bit more than the usual WWII fluff with a female doctor on her way to her new job picking up hitchhiking marines but stopping to visit her doctor uncle where the fun begins. He is one of two doctors in a town that has grown too fast with the war effort and tries to beguile her into staying and becoming the third doctor for the town. I wonder if the original movie was so fast paced but it was very enjoyable until the silliness of the final minutes and the conclusion which to me seemed as if everyone had just had enough and just stopped. If you like old movies you'll recognize a lot faces if not necessarily big names.",1517356800,,776,4.045454545454546
8045675,4,B000784XLW,"The transfer quality is sadly lacking.  Theres a conspicuous, steady hissing sound heard throughout and the image is scratchy.  As for the plot: a plastic surgeon (Ruth Hussey as Dr. Hedy) casually picks up three hitchhiking Marines on her way to the town of Blithewood.  Theyre all named Smith, isn't that convenient.  She immediately annoys a man she mistakes for someone else (John Carroll as Morgan Hale/ Smedley).  She stops to say hello to her uncle (the incomparable Charles Ruggles as Doc Fredericks), who conspires to keep her there to help him in his practice.  The story is a series of delaying tactics and clever ruses to distract Hedy long enough so she won't want to leave of her own accord.  This includes using Morgan Hale as a love interest (his abrupt change in attitude towards her is unconvincing).
Its a light comedy; Ruth Hussey has the best lines.  It was very pleasant but obvious.
I like most anything that features Charles Ruggles, so for that alone it was worth the six bucks.",1455840000,,1003,4.757225433526012
8045676,5,B000784XLW,"Hussey, Carroll and Ruggles are great in their roles and this movie is funny and laid-back enjoyment.  A surgeon returns to her Midwestern roots for a short visit on the way to Big Doin's in Chicago and everyone tries to get her to stay home....especially her overworked Uncle.  Good sets, good clothes, good quips, it's all GOOD.  It's not War and Peace.  Not deep or sad, just a good ole WWII story of what goes on back home.  I like films with strong women at the fore and this is one of those.",1420416000,2,497,4.301075268817204
8045677,3,B000784XLW,"The previous review here is for the Alpha Video production.  I viewed the film in a Mill Creek 50 Comedy set, and would agree on print quality etc.  The major problem with this film is the script.  It is pleasant but, medically,  about as believable as a Dr. Kildare feature from MGM, and it stretches credibility way past the breaking point that a doctor as intelligent as Hussey wouldn't see past the tricks Carroll and Ruggles use to keep her in this small town.  As the previous reviewer points out, the sets, etc. are very good and the actors are skilled so it's well worth the  80 minutes of your time if you like this kind of film.  Old car buffs should pay strong attention in the beginning; Ruth Hussey has a car that's a beaut!",1333929600,,737,4.375
8045678,3,B000784XLW,"Director Andrew Stone is considered by some cinastes as an auteur predicated upon his later work, but this frothy piece, originally titled BEDSIDE MANNER, is an example made during his earlier period, now available on an Alpha DVD that provides a more than merely acceptable print, utilizing the film's 1950 re-release, titled anew as HER FAVORITE PATIENT under the banner of Astor Pictures, with its rather disjointed plot, after Robert Carson's Saturday Evening Post story, offset by solid performances contributed by cast and crew members.  Produced and directed by Stone, the movie is too silly to be dislikeable, depicting a visit to her Midwestern hometown by physician Hedy Fredericks (Ruth Hussey) while on the way to her research position with a Chicago institute.  Her uncle, also a doctor, one of only two serving the burgeoning community, is overworked and desires that his niece remain in the town and aid with his practice, but Hedy is very resistant to that idea until her resolve is weakened after she meets a dashing test pilot, Morgan Hale (John Carroll) who, along with her ""Uncle Doc"" (Charles Ruggles) develop a scheme that, by hopefully eliminating any desire to continue on to Chicago, will enable Hedy to not only assume a portion of local medical responsibilities, but also to favour Morgan's not unwelcome romantic advances.  Talented Hussey finds naught to tax her accomplished sense of comic timing, and costumes created for the slender star are first rate; Carroll is oddly appealing in an uncustomary comedic role; Ann Rutherford and Renee Godfrey stand out among many skilled supporting female players; Grant Mitchell effortlessly performs as Hale's boss; veteran character actor Frank Jenks heads a trio of amourous Marines; and pleasing turns come from Syd Saylor, mouthing bromides, and Earle Hodgins, a past master of garrulity.  Efficient editing by Cecil De Mille alumnus James Smith is specially valuable for the film's pacing, as is fine sound quality engendered by Frank Webster, while the interior decor of Jacque Mapes and overall art direction under Rudi Feld also enhance this pleasant souffl wherein occasional weakly composed dialogue is handled crisply by director Stone.",1150416000,6,2218,5.257062146892656
