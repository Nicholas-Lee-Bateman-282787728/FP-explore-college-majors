2117387,5,B0002S64NW,"This DVD is worth every penny, and more!  My daughters have about 20 different DVDs, and with trial and error over the years, I've learned exactly what they like.  Now I have to say that every child is different, but my girls are mesmerized every time I play this one, and they liked it from day one, beginning to end.  The DVDs out there are hit and miss in terms of their ability to interest the girls, and this one is a hit.  It deserves all the rave reviews.",1099872000,3,462,4.157303370786517
2117388,5,B0002S64NW,"after my friend recommended Baby and Parent Nursery to me, i got my kids both dvds in the series (ages & stages playtime, and language & numbers playtime).  they couldn't be happier with them.  my kids are 10 months and 4 years, and these dvds completely hold their attention.  every time they sit smiling and engrossed, watching the toys move and bouncing to the music . . . they're also a good learning tool, teaching animals and other words.  As for the ""parent nursery"" part, they call it that b/c each dvd has a section with information for parents (eg, how your baby's brain develops, how to encourage language and reading skills etc) . . . it's actually very interesting . . . but i think the ""parent nursery"" name fits even more because it's a ""nursery"" where mommies can have a few free minutes every day while the kids are watching!!! . . . a nursery to keep me sane!  i would highly recommend Baby and Parent nursery to every mom out there!!!",1099612800,5,953,4.454022988505747
2117389,5,B0002S64NW,"I originally got Baby and Parent Nursery for my son, who's 9 months old.  He generally likes the other Baby videos we have, and I thought, ""If I have time, it might be interesting to watch their special section with parenting advice from doctors.""  It filled my expectations and more!  My son is absolutely enamored with the trains and other cute scenes, and loves to watch every time we play it ... and I found the Parent Nursery section very, very informative.  This is an absolute hit!",1098748800,5,488,4.574712643678161
2117390,5,B0002S64NW,"We have lots of other baby videos -- but this one definitely holds our baby's attention the best.  Every time we play it, she watches with full attention the whole time.  The bonus sections for parents are also very good -- with lots of useful information that you just don't see in other videos.",1096848000,5,296,4.462962962962963

8031314,5,B0002S64NW,"I borrowed this DVD from my library before buying just to make sure my daughter would like it. It was a huge success. At that time she was 12 months old, and it was the first thing on TV she paid attention for more than 5 minutes, actually, she watched the complete video almost without blinking. She loves it!!!! And it also calms her down when she's upset for any reason. It's unbelievable! A great helper for moms and dads, and also a great tool for babies mental development and learning. She specialy loves the Old MacDonald song, and tries to sing along every time. This DVD it's a must have for any parent.",1127952000,,613,4.385964912280702
8031315,5,B0002S64NW,"Our kids LOVE Baby and Parent Nursery - they dance and bounce to the music and say ""duck"" every time a duck comes on screen . . . and my younger one loves the Thomas the Tank Engine scenes.  There are so many DVDs out there, we didn't know where to start looking.  This won several awards (Coalition for Quality Children's Media, Kids First, National Parenting Seal of Approval, etc.) and is actually endorsed and produced by several groups of doctors.  Based on that, we tried it . . . and are VERY happy we did.  The parts for parents are actually quite interesting too.",1125705600,,572,4.419047619047619
8031316,4,B0002S64NW,"We're first-time buyers of Baby and Parent Nursery, and were very pleased.  The section for babies completely entertains and occupies our daughter.  It has a format very similar to other baby videos (ie: colorful scenes of moving toys, introduces numbers, words, shapes, happy classical music) ... and it completely captivates her attention while she watches quietly and happily (even more than our baby einstein videos).  Plus, there's a whole separate section here for parents with substantial information about baby brain development, physical development, milestones, etc. -- more than you could really watch in one sitting.  There's a lot packed into this video -- definitely worth getting.",1100563200,,695,5.528301886792453
8031317,5,B0002S64NW,"This video is so watchable (and re-watchable) for the whole family.  Our kids love the stimulating ""baby TV"" features.  They love going through them and pointing out their favorites.  We parents enjoy watching the stimulating and intelligent child development segments.  We gotten so much from the video to help our kids' minds develop and grow.  Keep up the good work!",1100390400,,369,5.083333333333333
8031318,5,B0002S64NW,"In my opinion, this is among the top 5 baby videos.  My son has watched it for the umpteeth time and still loves it, like all his other videos.  But this video does an unusually good job at introducing animals and colors and other basic ideas, while still keeping your child's attention.  My son particularly likes the Thomas the Tank engine scenes.  It's a good addition to our collection.",1099958400,5,390,4.608695652173913
8031319,4,B0002S64NW,"We have four month old twin daughters who BOTH love this video. With other videos one usually loves it and the other gets bored. NOT so with this video. There is a great deal of content in this video series. Not only are the toys great, the songs are easy on Mom's ears and the parent information is very informative as well. Most of all, I love the fact that when it is playing, my girls are amused and excited. Its also nice to not see the same two children in every video...

I also suggest the Language Nursery Video and Brightening Minds video. All great buys.",1099958400,4,565,4.280373831775701
