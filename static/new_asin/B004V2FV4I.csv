8442720,4,B004V2FV4I,"Raj Sippy was known as a good commercial director in his heydays. Movies like Inkaar, Satte Pe Satta, Andar Baahar, Loha, Thanedaar and Satyamev Jayate were not only well made but also had repeat value. This movie, made in 1987, was a simple story of the life of a honest police officer, his fight against the system, against his own past and against a failed love life. Vinod Khanna, in the lead role, gets to portray a gamut of emotions and this is easily one of his better movies. But the best performance in the movie certainly comes from Meenakshi Seshadri. She has the role of a harassed woman, who's treated rather contemptuously by everyone including the lead actor,and her character evokes sympathy among the viewer. Meenakshi has only a few scenes in the movie but almost all of them are powerful (and emotional) and she has acted very well in them. Shakti Kapoor is good as the villain while Vinod Mehra is commendable in a supporting role. Overall an entertaining movie, especially considering the fact that it was made in the 1980s.",1306281600,,1045,4.715846994535519
