8708625,1,B00UXI3JZC,"Don't waste your time or money on this movie.  It leave you with the feeling of emptiness like really really?  I give it one star based on the male actors being easy on the eye, that's it.",1445299200,,188,4.054054054054054
8708626,1,B00UXI3JZC,Horrible !  The woman can't act at all!! Terrible acting and editing,1441584000,,68,4.666666666666667
8708627,2,B00UXI3JZC,"I usually enjoy Ranbir Kapoor's acting, but he was barely a character in this movie. I could have handled the movie had it just been slow paced, but there was virtually no emotion on screen and the flow was completely off. The music did not fit where placed. I believe that the fault is not with the actors, but with the script. The plot line is bland with no passion, gripping suspense, or dynamic characters. The actors didn't have much to work with.",1440892800,,452,4.457831325301205
