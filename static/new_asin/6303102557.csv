561520,3,6303102557,"This is a compelling story of a young girl and her mother, and the mother's story about a wild horse called Thowra that lives in the mountains of Australia.  It is a cross between a child's story and a tale for adults, with a lot of great scenery and some nice scenes featuring Caroline Goodall and Russell Crowe (separately).  What distracts the viewer, though, is the goofy theme music and the endless shots of horses running, horses fighting, and an awful lot of slo-mo that is mostly unnecessary.",1358553600,,500,4.670454545454546

561573,4,6303102557,"This film is about much more then horses. It speaks profoundly of how we live to conquer.
We first conquered, that is beat until the spirit died out, those people who existed before us on this continent.
To beat the heart out of a people is like ""breaking"" wild horses. It is the spirit that makes this animal great and it is the spirit that makes a people great.

Breaking the stallion holds mixed emotions for us since we have long based our civilization on the use of horses and of slave labor.

We might still be in England had we not dispossessed the Native Americans.

Still, we speak very little of our ""rapist ethics"" which we live by now as much as when the country was first founded.

I just wanted to wake people up who didn't recognize the symbolize here and who tend to be literal in their life views.

""The Silver Stallion reminded me of another film, ""Grisly Man"", the documentary on the life of Timothy Treadwell, who journeyed to Alaska to study the biggest bear of all, and who died the way he lived, committed to these wild animals.
People judged him because our species seeks to control nature and so we fear it and do not understand it. That is what was sad, not his dying.

I want to add that this is a great film, beautifully made and very intense, however a word of caution for very young viewers. Personally, I couldn't take the scene when the two stallions fought and skipped over it.",1331251200,,1410,4.403846153846154
561574,4,6303102557,"The Silver Stallion is a very beautiful movie. The horses in the film are gorgeous, and the music's pretty nice. The setting is very visually appealing as well.

The story is fairly simple. We have a mother telling a story of the Silver Brumby/Stallion named Thowra to her daughter, while we see the story unfolding as it is in real life. Russel Crowe plays ""The Man"", who wants to capture and tame Thowra but is constantly thwarted by the almost supernatural abilities of this wild horse.

If I had to grade this movie, it'd give a B. It's not extremely engaging or anything, although the actors do a well enough job spare a few hammy ""villainous"" scenes from Crowe. The DVD doesn't have any sort of extras either. If you love horses or just would like to watch something very visually captivating, you'll likely enjoy this. I saw this movie when I was very young and after watching it again as an adult I still thought it be to enjoyable.",1328227200,2,940,4.523529411764706

561578,5,6303102557,"Based on a book, this movie was amazingly done. The movie tells the story from the point of view of the mother, writing a novel about a great silver brumby. Her daughter reads the novel as she writes it, but as she gets close to the end, and the legend of the horse is yet complete, you get the present action of the horse. The horse who would rather be dead than captured. Its a sad ending until you realize that perhaps the horse isn't dead.
Personally, I loved this movie. The horses were beautiful, the acting was amazing, and a young Russell Crowe? Can you really complain with a young Russell Crowe?",1302307200,2,605,4.3628318584070795

I myself enjoyed the beautiful scenery and footage of the horses was awesome. I felt though that the acting was left to be desired.

This movie is a great movie. My family and I all sat down to watch it and everyone enjoyed it. I give this movie a 4 star because it is not as magical as it was when I was a little girl. This movie is still a wonderful movie!,1231977600,3,395,3.6588235294117646
561631,1,6303102557,Could not get past the first 15 minutes of this movie.  It is just bad. Enough said.,1229385600,,84,3.9411764705882355
561632,5,6303102557,This movie is somewhat different in that the writer takes you back and forth between the real and the imaginary leaving you wondering sometimes as to which is which.  It is a delightful story that shares the love between a mother and daughter.  It is also fun because the story is told from the perspective of the horse instead of a person.,1217548800,,340,4.467741935483871

561634,1,6303102557,Bought this for my 4 yr old son that loves... horses.  It is very dark - and for him it was hard to understand.  I thought the production of it was bad.  I was just really disappointed.,1208736000,,185,3.945945945945946
561675,1,6303102557,Sorry but I was not impressed with this movie. I thought there would be more beautiful scenery.  Maybe Snowy River just spoilt me. That had the scenery.

561676,4,6303102557,This film was a nice surpise.  I love horses and can watch most anything that involves them but this was a few steps up from that.  It had a lot of the beauty of 'Man from Snowy River'.  The acting and story are worth the watch.  The best though were the horse scenes - well shot with beautiful animals.  There was even a bit of tension and mystery in both the story line and location.  A very pleasant film!,1197849600,2,408,4.10126582278481

As a child, I rented this movie, and I loved it, and when I was older, I felt the need to watch it again.

561681,4,6303102557,I love Russell Crowe which helps.  Very 'Man from Snowy River' Australian story which has all the drama and action that kept my 7 year old riveted to the movie.

561684,5,6303102557,This movie about horses in Australia is well done.  The scenery and landscape are intriguing as they are so different from ours in America.  Good acting also.,1163030400,4,158,4.814814814814815
561695,5,6303102557,"I enjoyed this dvd,but discoved it is also known as The Silver Brumby,which Ihad purchased the day before this dvd arrived.",1162684800,4,123,4.904761904761905
561696,3,6303102557,"Based on the book ""The Silver Brumby"" by Elyne Mitchell, ""The Silver Stallion"" opens during a storm, with a mother composing a story to comfort her daughter, Indi. She tells of the birth of Thowra, a palomino brumby in the high country of Australia's outback, named after the wind. As Thowra grows into a magnificent young stallion, he catches the attention of local ranchers, intent on capturing the beautifully-colored horse. One man in particular (played by a young Russell Crowe), becomes obsessed with the hunt. But the more intent he is on catching the stallion, the more maddeningly cunning and elusive Thowra becomes.

The film switches back and forth between the story of Indi and her mother, and the tale of Thowra himself, with Indi's mother narrating. Eventually we find that the two stories are more interconnected than they seem at first. Unfortunately, neither story has a very strong plotline. Crowe's character's pursuit of Thowra can be boiled down to a series of chase scenes, punctuated by rivalry between stallions of neighboring brumby herds, while the action between Indi and her mother consists of the girl continuously pestering her mother to divulge the next chapter, with a seemingly unrelated side-story about an injured wallaby thrown in for good measure.

As other reviewers have pointed out, this is not ""The Man From Snowy River."" The horses are anthropomorphized a bit too much for my tastes, and the acting tends toward cheesiness at times, though not so much as to be unbelievable. The soundtrack - often taking on a chanting quality that grows more intense as each chase scene progresses - is rather melodramatic, occasionally even disturbing by its overbearing nature. Nevertheless, while this film fails to really impress me as an adult, I'm pretty sure I would have loved it as a child. The horses are beautiful, and the theme of a cunning animal hero consistently outwitting the ""bad guys"" is just what most children will love.

The DVD itself, unfortunately, leaves much to be desired. The movie is presented only in fullscreen format, and though the cinematography and picture quality themselves are not top quality, the shots of the Australian high country would have been much more breathtaking in a widescreen presentation. There are also no special features whatsoever. In summation, I'd recommend this film primarily to families with younger children, especially those that love horses. Children will likely find the story exciting and the horses endearing. But even at a mere 93 minutes in length, it doesn't offer much to hold the attention of adult viewers.",1157673600,49,2607,5.100702576112412

561698,5,6303102557,"The silver stallion, Thowra, is breath takingly beautiful, but i don't get why they call him silver when he is a palomino. The countryside is GORGOUS! The acting is ok, but the movie is not really about that, but the horses. All of the scenes are really good except the end scene, and the song that plays with the credits is breath-taking! I loved this movie and it is great for any horse lover or pre-teen! RECOMENDED!!!",1135900800,16,421,4.48051948051948
561699,2,6303102557,"Based on previous reviews, you would have thought this was another MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER: it's not, not by a long shot. I watched SNOWY after wading through this one, and was amazed at how much better it was. It's not that the horses aren't amazing - they are. But the story is weak, the cinematography is undistinguished, and this desperately needs a wide screen. I have to agree with another reviewer that this is a B movie.

On the other hand, Caroline Goodall turns in a wonderful performance as a writer creating a story about a silver stallion that has become a legend in the outback of Australia. She narrates parts of the story almost as if she were telling it around a campfire at night, so that it has a certain eerie quality. Ami Daemion is enjoyable as her daughter, reading her mother's story as she completes it in chunks, and becoming more and more obsessed with the horse. Russell Crowe plays a rancher bent on catching the silver stallion, and in his usual, likeable way is entertaining in this early performance of his career. Unfortunately, he gets little more to do than show off his riding abilities, because the real stars of the movie are the horses.

This film has some excellent horse work, except for the fight sequences between the ruling stallions, which are little more than dances. Nevertheless, as animal actors, they're wonderful. If I had it to do over, I would have given this film three stars instead of two, because it is a sweet story to snuggle up with the family on a weekend afternoon. I think pre-teen girls and any horse-lover will especially love it.

With her mother's voice intoning in the little girl's mind, the dramatic story unfolds: One dark and stormy night, a magnificent golden colt with a silver mane and tail is born and leads a life of great adventure. The narrative switches back and forth between the horse's story, and the people's. Very well done.

Thowra is supposed to be a silver creamy, but he's just cream in this movie. I've seen pictures of creamy/silver horses and I think they should have used a silver horse for ""the silver brumby/stallion"" it only makes sense. 2. they left out many important characters like mirri and storm, especially storm who is Thowra's best friend and in the book is in almost every chapter. Also they left out Arrow-who was like the brogla for Thowra when he was growing up, and was SO important! they where so stupid to leave him out. I think it's stupid to leave out such an important main character. But anyway, it is a GREAT movie and you will ENJOY it-but better yet, read the book, no matter how good the movie is it just can't beat the book.",1099785600,10,896,4.403614457831325

  It's a stormy night.  This storm is different than any other storm.  The wind is loud.  A mother begins to tell her daughter about the mighty white stallion born on a wild spring storm like this one.  Some say they have never seen him, others say it is a ghost.  The mother horse tries to teach her pony how to survive in the wilderness.  Along comes a man (Russell Crowe) who enjoys nature.  He sees a stranded young cow stuck in the muck of a pond.  He rescues the cow and tells it to go back to its mother, who was awaiting.  He later sees the special horse and tries to capture it for his own, but the mother horse chases the man off.  The mother horse then teaches her pony to learn the scent of a man.
  Suitable for children.  Beautiful cinematography and locations.",1085184000,8,879,4.2682926829268295
561729,5,6303102557,This movie has to be one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it when I was just a little girl and to this day I still love it. The scenery with wild horses running and being free gives you the chills and gives horses a whole new meaning. This movie always keeps you on your toes and watching the whole time. If you love horses you will love horses. It makes me want to go out and ride my horse in the middle of a big a field and just run and be free.,1069372800,3,452,3.71875
561730,5,6303102557,"When I was little I found a movie about a glorious palomino brumby. I must have been about only four or five, but I was completely enthralled.  Since then I have badgered my mom into renting it for me as much as I could. Finally after they didn't seem to carry it anymore at the movie rental stores, she bought it for me off of this website. And it has been by far the most viewed movie out of my families movie collection. It has always been my favorite movie. And since I love palomino horses with all of my heart, it fits perfectly. And I happen to think that Golden is the most beautiful horse that I have ever seen. She is gorgeous.",1069113600,3,637,4.137096774193548
561731,4,6303102557,"My kid loves this movie and rented it so many times that I finally purchased it.  I believe it's a bit autobiographical--the mother writes the ""story"" for her daughter, only somehow the story turns out to be true.  Russell Crow plays ""The Man"" (I read that he did the film for his horse-crazy niece) and does a fine job at it.  The horses are beautiful, although I've never thought of a creamy palimino as silver.  Oh well.  As a parent, you can sit through this movie and not be bored to tears.  Beautiful scenery, horses, nice story.",1054598400,4,535,4.463917525773196
561732,5,6303102557,This is a very good Horse show about a wild stallion which both my mom and I loved watching. Everyone in the family should like this show it is clean and keeps you glued to the TV wondering what will happen next to Thowra The Silver Stallion. I wish they made more clean shows like this one that everyone in the family can enjoy without worrying about foul language.

This is one of the best horse movies ever made about a wild horse. The Silver Stallion is a wild Austrailian horse who has an undying will to be free- and not even Man can contain his wild spirit. I hope this is released on DVD soon, because everybody should be able to watch this movie at its absolute BEST!!! May the Horse be With You!",1024012800,5,509,3.9514563106796117

The scenery is beautiful,and the air fighting they use is very impressive. It is a story about a brumby stallion who is hunted ( not to eat ) by men season after season. He manages to out smart and out run the man for a while but then he falls in love with the mans palomino mare and steals her away from the man and one thing leads to another.

561759,5,6303102557,"Everything about this movie is captivating and haunting.  The beautiful stallion, the scenery, and the soundtrack.  The movie tells the story of Elyne Mitchell and her daughter Indi.  Elyne is writing a story called The Silver Brumby.  Indi reads the story and falls in love with the silver brumby.

Thowra means ""wind"" in the Aboriginee tongue.  It's an appropriate name, as Thowra seems to have a mythical bond with the elements and can summon them to his aid when needed.  I was disappointed that he only did this twice in the movie.  However, it was cool when he did.

The movie's soundtrack is haunting and beautiful, using a distinctly Australian sound and chanting Thowra's name softly in the background.  I don't know if they used a flute or a recorder, but there's a beautiful woodwind sound to the theme.  Tiddas did a great job singing ""Son of the Wind"" at the end.  I would love to find this soundtrack on CD.

edit: OK now the movie is out on DVD. I'm glad it's out and will purchase the DVD. But the format is disappointing to say the least: fullscreen and only Dolby Stereo. Where's the anamorphic and the 5.1 goodness I crave?",1013731200,4,1142,4.594059405940594

But as a horesewomen, I fell in love with horses all over again.  They were magnificent!  ...and so was the country.  ...and then of course Russell Crowe.  His passion shows even in this quiet role... his riding was exhilarating (though a little sloppy with the lower leg)...  he exhibits a wonderful rapport with animals... he brings Clarity and depth to his character (even Thirty Odd Foot away)... sorry Russell I couldn't resist. This is a great story, beautifully filmed...the pace is perfect...  better than Black Beauty... oh such sacrilege!! but you see this has Russell Crowe.",1012953600,6,724,5.059322033898305
561761,5,6303102557,I purchased this video so I would have a good movie for my grandchildren to watch.  So far so good.  The response from them (ages 10 & 7) is that they sat still through the whole movie and really enjoyed it.  This movie is the winner of a 1994 parents choice award.  Excellent for young people and it doesn't hurt that Russell Crowe is in it.  You get to watch the talented Russell Crowe ride his horse - and it was him - not a double.  He is so versatile.  Excellent storyline too.  This is a must for your video collections.,1008892800,2,526,4.138613861386139
561782,5,6303102557,"Man sees what he wants and goes after it--  regardless of anything else.  For every action there is a reaction.  The horse wants to remain free because it is in its nature and upbringing to remain so.  Man's nature tells him he has to have this horse.  He wants it and he will get it at whatever cost.
The horse - driven beyond its endurance - would rather die than not be free.  Noble for the horse.  Maybe even honorable.  tragic?  Yes because the horse dies.  And yes because the man is left without the prize.",1007510400,,513,4.25

The tale of a brave wild horse fighting humans and his own kind for a place in the world is both familiar and new.  The equestrian photography especially is nothing short of breathtaking, and the lush scenery gives a view of Australia most of us never knew existed.
Although Russell's part must be considered ""featured"" as opposed to ""lead,"" he makes the most of it, giving his villain-in-spite-of-himself just the right amount of dogged blindness and sly charm.  And the man has never been quite so beautiful as in this film.  He seems to glow from within, as if every moment of the shoot were a joy.",995500800,6,693,4.75

It's a special treat for people who truly know a lot about horses in the terms they use, but is still enjoyable for every horse lover.  The story is very unique and about the beautiful brumbies of Australia and thier hardships as horses.

The horses were beautiful and wild.  As a breeder of horses I was very disturbed at the fight sequences between the stallions.  Since this movies is supposed to be a ""family oriented"" film I was surprised they showed such violence.  Crowe again proves he doesn't need lines to project his masculinity.",982195200,9,472,4.430232558139535

 ...this has been mentioned as another version of ""The Man From Snowy River"", I have no problem with that. Australian's do love their horses and they make really exceptional films about them. ""Phar Lap"" is another wonderful example of these films.
It's nice to get alittle Australia in your veins and visit the bush and the High Country for a time.
In this film Mr. Crowe had some real competition on screen. It was from the animal stars, fortunately, there seemed to be some real bonding between Russell and his animal co-stars. His dog seemed to really love him as did his horses. If you've ever had a pet or worked on a film you know that this is not always the easiest thing to catch on film.

However, it showed life through the horses'  eyes very well, and the potential cruelty of man (without needlessly  dwelling on the latter). The human actors were for the most part well-acted  (except for the young girl), but the horses outshone them all.  I will not  hesitate to purchase this video for my own neice.
