2420701,5,B000BJKWP8,"THE PROBLEM IS THIS: 40+ YEARS (AND MILLIONS OF HOURS) OF MEDIA SAYING THE MOON LANDINGS WERE REAL, AND ONLY A FEW YEARS ARGUING AGAINST THEM.

So everyone coming to this film has had years of being told the official line. That's a lot to compete with and a lot to flush out of the brain.

Just imagine if the USSR (Russia) had carried out the moon landing.

Imagine the dent in US national pride. Well if Bart SIbrel had then come along and accused the USSR of faking the landing.

The US support would have been in the majority - 'of course Russia did not land on the moon' everyone would have chorused.

The problem is that most people see such an historic event, an event that has come to be seen as 'man's' greatest achievement, through political filters.

No if Russia had done it, becuase we don't WANT them to have done,

or YES if the US did it, beacuse we'd WANT that.

Looking at the evidence presented in the films, and looking at the official responses, and debunking, the case for a faked moon landing is over the 1/2 way mark - so its more likely that it was faked than real.

I suggest you watch his films for yourself, and decide for yourself, and try not to let any preconcieved ideas filter what you see.

An interesting fact: When the Soviets managed to build a system that could track rockets from the earth to the moon, the remaining 3 Apollo missions were all suddenley cancelled.",1168128000,12,1403,4.382239382239383
2420702,1,B000BJKWP8,"Bart Sibrel is an alternative theorist on the moon landings that occured in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  He claims that the United States astronauts did not land on the mooon at all and the whole thing was staged!  What is his evidence for this 'out-of-this-earth' claim?  He presents one videotape where the astronauts on the Apollo are supposidely faking  a shot.  How about that folks, Bart Sibrel thinks with one piece of videotape he can debunk the entire moon space program.  It is one thing to be a skeptic, it is another thing to be ridiculous.  I came into this video eager to see what Sibrel had to offer.  After watching him confront one astronaut after the next, I was deeply disappointed and I felt I had wasted my time.

Most of this video consists of Bart Sibrel annoying the former astronauts and trying to make them confess (swearing on the Bible) that they actually did go to the moon.  Some of the astronauts are patient enough to deal with his garbage, but Sibrel is so incredibly annnoying the astronauts can't help but strike back at him verbally and physically.  Sibrel does not try the proper approach in trying to confront the astronauts.  It does not help his cause by irratating all the astronauts to the point where most viewers will side with the astronauts and not Sibrel.  I think this man needs to grow up a little bit.  He has an idiotic smirk on his face everytime he talks.  It makes him look less credible and more like a gigantic goofball.  I too have recently become a skeptic on the moon landing, but I still haven't seen strong enough evidence to make me believe the moon landings were a hoax.  This man and his video are not a good start for moon landing skeptics.",1161648000,20,1709,4.514657980456026

-Carl Sagan-

In a way, like nave Adam and Eve, you can't blame people for initially being deceived, after all, which is a more pleasant realm to live in, one in which your country or world continually lies about science, integrity and spending, or one in which your country or world is scientifically unsurpassed, honorable and financially honest?  Naturally, people almost always seem to see the latter because this is the kind of realm they would rather live in.

Personally, if I had cancer, I would want to know about it rather than pretending that I didn't have it.  (Obviously though, some people prefer being lied to with pleasantries.)  While pretending that I wasn't diseased would temporarily pacify my emotions, it would also unabatedly spread the disease, potentially to fatality, because I ignored it.  On the other hand, while finding out that you have cancer is quite depressing, you can at least plan according to reality instead of fantasy, and perhaps actually accomplish more with this information, knowing that you have limited opportunity to change your life for the better.

When I ask leading ""intellectuals"" why they will not even briefly consider just the possibility of a moon landing fraud, they say ""No one would do such a thing.""  (That is to say, no one would be that audaciously wicked.)  My argument is that in a world full of genocide, murder, rape, theft, mutilations and molestations, is merely lying about a scientific accomplishment so farfetched?  After all, haven't Nobel laureates in the past been forced to give back their medals for plagiarism and deceit?  Yes, they have!

These type of people who vehemently oppose the admission of a cover-up regarding the Apollo ""moon"" landings, with endorsements of felony violence to defend and maintain a corruptive status quo, have openly admitted, time and time again, that if firsthand eyewitness Neil Armstrong himself had went on national television and confessed to the cover-up prior to his death, they would still believe that the moon landings were real, when he was there and they were not! . . . Who then is mentally deficient, as they claim the conspiracy theorists are regarding this?  These people will not even consider for one second, even the possibility, that the alleged manned moon missions were a cold war deception to inflate the appearance of American military superiority, as well as pacify rampant disgruntled domestic revolt during the Vietnam war, so how can the opinions of such close-minded people be trusted in the first place?  The supposed manned moon missions are a religion to them . . . and a false one at that.  (See  2nd Thessalonians  2: 9-12)

Hitler, the master of deception, said that it was actually easier to get away with a gigantic lie than a small one, because small lies are so common and therefore anticipated, so that no one would expect the audacity of a grand deception.  This is precisely the psychological tactic that was used in precipitating and maintaining the monumental, yet very simple, lie of the manned moon landings . . . with 1960's technology.  Again, a feat that cannot even be done today!

Never before in the entire history of the world did such an historical event have absolutely no independent press coverage.  Why do investigators overlook this most telling piece of evidence?  Only three government employee eyewitnesses to the ""greatest event in history""?  Whatever completely government controlled and edited photographs and images were given to the press were blindly assumed to be authenticated by the ""credible"" Nixon administration.  It is like giving a whining child cake for dinner to appease them and then expecting them to argue with you demanding broccoli instead!

The Vietnam War during the alleged moon missions was destroying the country from within by its divisiveness and civil protests.  Nixon repeatedly said so himself, thinking that this mounting public discontent might actually lead to real anarchy, rebellion and the disintegration of the government, not to mention his precious egotistical cushy job!  A unifying pep rally of a successful moon landing was just what the American patient needed!  Do you really think that Nixon was going to risk killing three national ""heroes"" on ""live"" worldwide television during his presidency when simply failing to rescue kidnapped hostages would ruin you for life as it did president Carter a few years later?  How could he absolutely guarantee a successful moon mission? . . . To stage it! . . . Not to mention that it was technologically impossible at the time to begin with.  In fact, according to NASA contractor William Kaysing, who worked for six years on the Apollo program, a classified interdepartmental memo, which he personally read and proofed, estimated the likelihood of a successful manned mission on the first attempt at a mere one in ten thousand chance.

Some assume that if the Soviet Union or Chinese intelligence agencies found out that the American moon landings were fraudulent they would ""spill the beans"" to the rest of the world.  This is simply not true, and again, thinking only one step farther than programmed to do reveals the truth.  If wars are created for the profiteering of the ""Military Industrial Complex"", as many forward thinking people including president Eisenhower now realize, then ""adversaries"" of America are merely imaginary, created for profitable ends by the billionaires pulling the strings behind the scenes, who have been making money off of war, ""cold"" or otherwise, just as Eisenhower warned, since world war one.  (Think about it: America has been at war, nonstop, since the end of world war two, more than seventy years ago!)  As such, the Soviet Union and China are, in fact, in-league with the United States government, despite mainstream media appearances.  (Just imagine a fake wrestling match.)  This being the case, these overseas entities would not bring the truth of such an American scandal into the light to injure their co-conspirator brother.  Any ""bad blood"" the United States appears to have with foreign powers is merely staged for the very purpose of keeping their complicity a secret.

Even if these two ""super-powers"" were actual enemies of America, they still would not expose the truth about the moon missions.  For example, if I had a picture of the president with a prostitute, would it be more profitable for me to give it away free to the press corps, or to blackmail him year after year with ever increasing tolls until the day he died?  If such countries really were enemies of America and had proof of the moon landing fraud, it would serve their interests much more to keep such knowledge to themselves and blackmail America, year after year, administration after administration, to get the behind-the-scenes negotiations to favor them, whether it regarded trade, arms, debt, or anything else they so desired.

There were, in fact, no ""independent"" tracking stations for the Apollo missions.  The only entities that had such capability were the United State's own government agencies (who were complicit in the cover-up) and the aforementioned countries, who profited from keeping the secret.  Additionally, NASA launched the ""Tetra-A"" satellite shortly before the Apollo missions to simulate transmissions coming from the moon so that their ground crews could rehearse the ""moon landings"" during their many simulations.  Conveniently, it was purported that the Tetra-A satellite ""accidently burned up"" in the earth's atmosphere just before the first moon mission, that way the government satellite could secretly still be in service, performing the same simulation function during the ""real"" flights.  Furthermore, retired ground crew members recently acknowledged that they could tell no difference whatsoever between a ""real"" and a ""simulated"" moon mission.

From Wikipedia regarding The Apollo Fraud:

""Some people insist that the Apollo moon landings were a cold war deception of the Nixon administration.  However, empirical evidence is readily available to show that manned moon landings did occur.  Anyone on earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can apparently bounce laser beams off three retro-reflector arrays reported to be left on the moon by Apollo 11, 14 and 15, suggesting deployment of the lunar laser ranging equipment at asserted Apollo moon landing sites, implying equipment constructed on earth was transported to the surface of the moon.  In addition, in August 2009, NASA's lunar reconnaissance orbiter claimed to send back high resolution photos of the estimated Apollo landing sites.  These government issued pictures show not only what is reported to be the faint shadows of the descent stages of the lunar landers allegedly left behind, but also apparent tracks of the astronauts' walking paths nearby in the lunar dust.""

At first (and only) glance, these appear to be relevant arguments, yet each one is, surprisingly, most easily and unconditionally refuted with only a modicum amount of further investigation beyond initial conditioned interpretation.  First of all, it has recently come to light through ""whistling blowing"" intelligence employees that ""Wikipedia"" is a mainstream, establishment supported, parasitical organism used rampantly for propaganda purposes by multiple government agencies such as the NSA, as they can anonymously post intelligent sounding pro-government thesis to the masses, often deliberately contradicting and smugly belittling more truthful ""conspiracy theories"" of very real crimes of the authorities in power, whose express purpose of these writings is to cover-up and deflect attention away from their own illegal and unholy behavior.  (See the Sleuth Journal article on this topic at the end of this writing.)  When they use words like ""empirical evidence is readily available to show that the manned moon landings did occur"" . . . It not only shows their arrogance (which, in and of itself, demonstrates their blindness to the facts), it also exemplifies their desperation to make an argument that is so much losing ground that they have to resort to the administration in power tactic that if you don't agree with them you are somehow deficient in intelligence.

It was proven in 1962 that a laser can be bounced and calibrated off of the moon without a man made reflector thereon simply due to the reflectivity of the lunar surface.  Secondly, Russia put a manmade mirror on the moon's surface during the time of the Apollo missions for this same claimed purpose, using instead an un-manned probe that would not have to suffer the biological ravages of lethal space radiation.  (See the March 1959 issue, Volume 200, Number 3, of the magazine ""Scientific American"", article entitled ""Radiation Belts Around the Earth"", to see how deadly and impenetrable space radiation is beyond the safety of low earth orbit where the space station currently resides, at an altitude of merely 205 miles above the earth . . . The moon being about 239,000 miles away.)  Thirdly, seeing how all of these lasers have their data computer controlled, it would only take one computer hacker, if they so desired, to manipulate the data shown on a scientist's viewing monitor, which they would then wrongly assume to be truthful.  (This was precisely the case at ""mission control"" during the ""moon"" missions, where dozens of computer ""operators"", who actually just read the preprogrammed data screens like news anchors who do not write their own words, openly admitted, after the fact, that they could tell no difference whatsoever between a flight ""simulation"" and a ""real"" flight.)

To say that additional ""new"" photographs from the criminal NASA are evidence that ""prove"" the moon landings were real is laughable.  They already faked high resolution, full body pictures of an ""astronaut"" standing right on the ""moon's surface"" nearly fifty years ago, so what is it to fake additional pictures now, with almost five decades better technology, of such simple things such as tiny shadows or scratches on lunar satellite photographs that are supposed to be from human foot tracks or Apollo lunar landers?  These diehard believers are just seeing what they want to see, like a nave spouse of a cheating partner, accepting the fox's evidence that they didn't steal a chicken.

Additional arguments against the fraud are reported to be the hundreds of thousands of people throughout industry who contributed to the missions, who allegedly would have had to have been informed of and kept the secret.  Again, seemingly a good argument, yet it is not with only a little extra thought and investigation.  Do you really think the CIA was stupid enough to tell hundreds of thousands of contractors the goings-on of a top-top-secret project?  Would the CIA really be so careless as to tell the person making the rocket's door handle, or the glove or the boot of the spacesuit, that they were actually faking the moon landings?  Do we really think the CIA is that stupid to tell so many low level people? Furthermore, to say that because my uncle worked at NASA and believed the moon landings were real, is proof that they were real, is like saying that because my uncle worked as a vender at the Super Bowl and believes that the game was honest, is proof that the football players didn't cheat to win!  How then can this be a genuine argument against the fraud?  Surely the government officials making this statement realize this and are deliberately trying to mislead the public away from the truth, like a profiteering shepherd herding their nave unwitting sheep to the slaughterhouse.

Just like a pyramid of power in any business, what the employee, the manager, and the regional manager knows about the business' actual agenda, is completely different than what the CEO at the very top knows.  Remember, there were only three people (""trusted"" government employees) who were actually there at the time.  As you will see in my film ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"" (the link follows this article), the three crew members were indeed on the rocket, they did launch into earth orbit (to attain realistic ""zero gravity"" flight photography), they did splash down in the ocean (to add to the realism), yet the rest, everything beyond earth orbit (which is only what they can do today), was completely contrived, like a masterful illusionist, by satellite data manipulation, complete media control, and professional movie sets.  After all, what is easier to do, actually build a rocket and travel to another planet with 1960's technology on the first attempt without killing anyone, or simply make a movie about it?  The age old argument ""The simplest explanation is the true one"", which many ""Apollo proponents"" use to suggest the missions authenticity, actually proves the fraud instead!  The simple fact is that it is easier to fake a moon mission than to actually do one . . . otherwise there would be manned bases there by now!

Some of the best evidence supporting the fraud is the fact that in 1998, when the space shuttle flew to its highest altitude ever, three hundred sixty-five miles, one third higher than they normally flew, they were asked to descend to a lower altitude by mission control due to lethal space radiation they encountered by approaching too close to the ""Van Allen Radiation Belts"", which don't even begin until one thousand miles altitude (and continue for an additional twenty-five thousand miles).  That is to say, they were six hundred thirty-five miles away from radiation that was so intense that they reported they could see the radiation with their eyes closed as sparks of light hitting the retinas of their shaded eyes.  When this happened, CNN inadvertently reported this fact by saying, ""The radiation belt surrounding earth is more dangerous than previously believed.""  Apparently not a single journalist on the entire planet figured out, except for myself, that this statement totally contradicts the authenticity of the moon landings!  Here's why:

The only time in world history human beings are said to have traveled through the twenty-five thousand mile thick radiation field called the ""Van Allen Radiation Belts"", which unbeknownst to most surrounds earth starting at an altitude of one thousand miles and extends twenty-five thousand miles beyond that, is during the alleged moon missions.  Why is it then that astronauts some six hundred thirty-five miles away from this radiation, twenty-nine years later, know more about the radiation than the Apollo astronauts who claimed they were in the middle of it eighteen times to the moon and back?

Remember, the recent discovery proves that the radiation is . . . ""more dangerous than previously believed"".  What is ""previously believed"" if not based on the previous reports from the ""experts"" of the radiation, the Apollo crews, who were allegedly the only ones in all of world history to have ever traveled through the radiation (and eighteen times at that, to the moon and back), all with no ill effects and no reports of any kind of the visible sparks of radiation being seen, as were later reported by the space shuttle crew from hundreds of miles away, not even in the middle of it as the Apollo crews supposedly were!  Again, how can people six hundred thirty-five miles away from radiation they have never traveled through or even to, know more about it than people who were allegedly in the middle of it eighteen times?!

Of course, this is simply not possible.

What does this mean?  It means that the people who claimed to have previously been inside the radiation field lied about being there!  Of course too, if the ""Apollo"" crews never went through the Van Allen Radiation Belt as this contradictory report reveals, then they certainly could not have gone to the moon either, which the traversing of this radiation would require!  Why does no one connect the dots with this very revealing information except me?  Because the dots lead to a horrific truth that would break the spirit of the entire American nation if they knew, proving that most people would rather believe a pleasurable lie, than a painful truth.

In fact, when I discovered absolute proof (actual, on camera evidence) that the Apollo astronauts never left earth orbit (contained in a newly discovered unedited NASA reel which was never broadcast to the public; debuted in ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"") and showed this controversial videotape to a news director at NBC, he turned pale white, practically fainted as he collapsed in his chair and exclaimed, ""Oh, my God!  It looks like we didn't go to the moon!""  ""I know"", I said, ""What do we do?""  This man, who held the betterment of America in his hand, thought for a long while . . . and then eventually ""chickened out"".  He said, ""I cannot broadcast this with a clear conscious.  It will cause a civil war.  I will not be the one responsible for that.""  While I disagree that the public knowing the truth about the moon missions would cause a civil war, they would probably demand governmental reform and start investigating other matters of corruption and deception.  Naturally, criminals would rather not get caught and preserve their way of life that reform would inevitably dismantle.

Oddly enough, when Bush Jr. was president, he went on national television and proclaimed that ""The United States will return to the moon as a logical first step to Mars and beyond"".  Did no one besides me notice that if they really already went to the moon six times, why would they need to do a ""first"" step over again for the seventh time?  He was even so bold as to go on to say that ""First we will need to learn how to protect the astronauts from lethal space radiation.""  Am I the only one curious enough to ask, ""Why not do it the same way that worked so good the first time they went to the moon?""

In August of 2009 it was reported, albeit as a news oddity (and it certainly was) that a ""moon rock"" personally given to the president of the Netherlands by Neil Armstrong in 1969, who supposedly hand picked it off of the ""moon's"" surface himself, was opened forty years later from its hermitically sealed container by a curious museum curator after he had watched ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"".  Following microscopic examination, the rock was verified to actually be a deceptively authentic looking piece of petrified wood instead!  Yet again, not a single journalist, except for myself, asked the question, ""If the moon rocks are fraudulent, what about the moon missions?""

If more people would only view with an open, deprogrammed mind, ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"", which contains newly discovered video evidence of the moon landing fraud, they would see with their own eyes recently uncovered unedited behind-the-scenes outtakes of false photography of the ""moon missions"".  The scene contained therein has never been broadcast to the public.  In it, Neil Armstrong is using a one foot diameter model of the earth, from low earth orbit, to create the illusion for the television viewers, that he and his crew are half way to the moon, when they are, in fact, still in earth orbit.  This is absolute proof that, though they were on the rocket in low earth orbit, the crew never went any further due to lethal space radiation.

This footage is even dated by NASA's own computer clock as having taken place two days into Armstrong's flight, when he is supposed to be half way to the moon, or some 135,000 miles away from the earth, yet he and his crew are clearly shown (in these newly discovered unedited outtakes of the broadcast) to still be in earth orbit, and are instead, falsifying the television photography to deceive the viewing public of their real location.  The CIA is even heard on a private, third audio channel, prompting Armstrong to respond to Mission Control's questions only after four seconds have elapsed, in order to create the false impression of an increased radio delay, so as to appear much farther from the earth than he and his crew actually were.  Jump ahead to time  32:02  in ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"" if you do not wish to view the entire forty seven minute documentary and only see the newly discovered unedited out-takes of Neil Armstrong falsifying mission photography during the historic and now infamous mission.

Recently, a website detractor to the obviousness of this fraud shown in the newly discovered footage debuted in my film, suggested that because I only showed excerpts of this condemning footage in the documentary, that I somehow tricked people into thinking that the clearly heard third track of CIA audio and the blatantness of the one foot diameter sized mocked-up model of the earth, was something other than a deliberate lie.  Seeing how my program is only forty-five minutes long and the unedited falsified footage reel is an hour in length, I deemed it quite logical and appropriate to show, in the most timely manner possible, the segments of the fraudulent video which displayed the most apparent falsification, editing from one such clip to the other.  According to this misleading and false accusatory thinking, showing only the highlights of a football game negates the winning team's victory.  As such, the one making this baseless accusation is the one guilty of deceiving his audience.

If the moon landings, which were done with such ease on the first attempt with 1960's technology, though they cannot be duplicated toady with nearly fifty years more advanced technology, are so obviously real, then anyone who says otherwise is an idiot.  Why then are there hundreds of websites, with tens of thousands of hours spent on their construction, in existence to refute the insane rantings of morons?  As Shakespeare so famously said, ""Thou does protest too much.""  Another historical commentator said this, ""The likelihood of one individual being right, increases in direct proportion to the intensity with which others are trying to prove him wrong.""

Even former president Clinton, once holding the (allegedly) highest office in the land, doubts the authenticity of the moon landings.  On Page 156 of his biography ""My Life"" he states:
""Just a month before, Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had left their colleague, Michael Collins, aboard spaceship Columbia and 'walked on the moon', beating by five months President Kennedy's goal of putting a man on the moon before the decade was out. The old carpenter asked me if I really believed it happened.  I said sure, I saw it on television. He disagreed; he said that he didn't believe it for a minute, that 'them television fellers' could make things look real that weren't. Back then, I thought he was a crank. During my eight years in Washington, I saw some things on TV that made me wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time.""

If a president of the United States is finally admitting his doubts as to the authenticity of the ""moon landings"" (albeit, after he safely left office) and is calling those who perceive the truth of the event ""ahead of their time"", shouldn't you also reconsider your thinking on the matter, if you haven't already?

When it comes to perceiving the truth in a world full of lies, historically, the majority has always been deceived, and later proved wrong, by the minority of their contemporaries, whom they persecuted and considered deceived at the time, when in fact it was they who were deceived.  Does a person know it when they are deceived?  No, they do not.  They defend the lie with red faces and clinched teeth.

The majority of scientists thought the world was flat, the majority of astronomers thought the earth was the center of the universe, the majority of physicians thought bleeding the sickness out of a person was a cure, the majority of congressmen thought Nixon was honest, and a majority of scientists, astronomers, physicians, and congressmen think the moon landings were real, yet their titles and majority do not equal truth, as history has well proven, and will prove again.

Why is it so difficult for them to see the truth?  Very simple . . . Pride.

""The Pride of your heart has deceived you.""

Obadiah 1:3

Pride is simply the unwillingness to be wrong, just as humility is the willingness to be wrong.  The great thing about being wrong, which is what I had to finally admit about the moon landings, is that I am learning something new, and I am no longer walking through life in error.  The bad thing about being right all the time, is that I cannot learn anything new, and I am living my life in a self-deceived state, which is the very worst form of deception.  When someone else deceives me, if I try hard enough, I can eventually figure it out, after all, I know that other people cannot be trusted all of the time.  Yet when I am self-deceived, it is nearly impossible to overcome, because the person I am relying on for ""facts"" is myself, and of course I can trust myself! . . . even when I am wrong.

When someone considers themself smart, this is the first step towards their ignorance.  They boast about their years of experience and degrees, and thereby pour concrete around their finite knowledge, unawaringly calling their stone mound of limited facts, the entire universe of truth.  If you try to tell them they are wrong, they will defend their post to their emotional and intellectual death at all cost, all the while attempting to defile you with their venomous words for pointing out their mistake, even if you are right, just like those previously mentioned throughout history.

Just like OJ Simpson's lawyers, who later admitted they knew of his guilt and were only ""doing their job"", no matter how plain the evidence, their deceptive lawyer-like minds have an explanation for why facts are fictions, and fictions are facts.  With every evidence I submit as to why the moon landings were falsified, no matter how condemning, there is always a zealous pride-filled counterpart to throw away the truth and institute a lie in its place, with each and every piece of factual evidence, just like OJ Simpson's defenders.  Just because someone has an explanation for something, or everything, does not mean that the explanation is true.

Rather than looking for the truth, even at the cost of being wrong, the majority of people, because of their blinding pride in the accomplishments of themselves and like-minded others, instead ""Gather around them a great number of teachers to tell them what their itching ears want to hear"".  (2nd Timothy 4:3)  In other words, rather than looking for the truth, they look for people to agree with what they already believe, so as to prove themselves right.

The extremely simple fact is this: After Columbus traveled to the new world, everyone else traveled to the new world.  After Lewis and Clark traveled to the American west, everyone else traveled to the American west.  After the Wright brothers accomplished powered flight, everyone else did immediately thereafter.

Lindbergh first flew across the Atlantic in an airplane in 1927.  Five decades later there were millions of airplanes flying across the Atlantic.  Soon it will be five decades since America allegedly had men leisurely playing golf on the moon in complete safety with 1960's technology, all on the first attempt.  In comparison, the 747 aircraft, built after seventy years of successful aviation history and millions of manufactured aircraft, was developed at the very same time as the ""Apollo"" spacecraft, the first ever vehicle to take men to another planet, yet it took one year longer to construct and made over 160 failed attempts before it finally got off of the ground!

Interestingly, more computing power today is found in a ten dollar watch than was in the entire Apollo program, including the entire spacecraft and all of the computers at ""Houston Control"", and yet for some reason, no one, from any nation on earth, has been able to go to the moon and survive, not even ONCE, with five decades more advanced technology . . . WHY? . . . There is only ONE possible answer . . . (It is soooooooo simple, yet people refuse to see the unpleasant truth) . . . Because it cannot be done . . . Even today!

If all the scientists from all the nations on earth cannot go to the moon today with all the newer technology that the 21st century has to offer, it simply means, and it cannot mean anything else, that America did not go to the moon in the 1960's.  Again, Technology does not go backwards!  It is sooooo obvious to anyone with an open mind who does not have a religious attachment to the event.

Just as Hitler's children, if he had any, would have a hard time seeing dear old papa as anything but a benevolent patriarch, mired tunnel-visioned ""intellectuals"" and misdirected beguiled ""patriots"" will seldom admit that their enamored ""scientific"" community and ""glorious"" government can be just as corrupt as pedophile priest.

Anyone gullible enough to think that BART SIBREL, a Nashville, TN Taxi-Cab driver, has either the education, the experience, the knowledge, or the access to valid sources of information regarding either the NASA Apollo Moon Landings or access to the Apollo Astronauts themselves, deserves to waste their money on this video.

8087496,5,B000BJKWP8,"This film captures confrontations with 9 of the Apollo astronauts in a manner untouched in history, with emotional outbursts, defensive postures, insults leveled, and quick escapes.

These men had little or no idea that their secret is out - the video that producer Bart Sibrel received from NASA's Johnson Space Center.  It shows the crew of Apollo 11 staging part of their mission.  Which part you may ask?  Their trip to the moon, from 130,000 miles out.  The film shows that they were faking the video shot of the Earth by darkening the interior of the CSM and then pretending to zoom through deep space and back again.  The only problem is, when they 'zoomed' back out, Armstrong had left a floodlight on - so this massive object is hanging there in deep space!

Of course they never showed this entire shot on TV.  How could they?

And there's much more, from shadows to stars, and so much more.

But above all, the astronauts are not able to counter the questions of Van Allen Belt radiation and the 72 degree maintenance of LEM atmosphere temperature in the hostile lunar environment.

8087497,1,B000BJKWP8,"There is only one reason you would ever want to suffer through this video, and that is to see a 72-year-old Buzz Aldrin punch Bart Sibrel, an ""investigative journalist"" who gives even the worst of ambush journalists a bad name, right in the mouth and to see Edgar Mitchell literally kick him in the rear end.  You'll want to do the same thing long before this video is over.  Now it's one thing to argue that the moon landings were a hoax and present your arguments in a serious manner, but that's not this guy's m.o.  All Bart Sibrel does is ambush Apollo astronauts out of the blue or finagle interviews with them under false pretences (and sometimes even a fake camera crew) so he can harass them and ultimately ask them to swear on the Bible he's brought with him that they truly orbited or walked on the moon.  He's such an arrogant jerk that any hope of cooperation with him has already been smashed by this point (although a couple of astronauts do take his little oath, hoping it will make him go away).  Sibrel, of course, then says their refusal to take that oath and their hostile attitude toward him are proof that they never went to the moon.  It's an absolutely shameful display by this cretin; I was intensely uncomfortable just watching him do it over and over again.  This guy should be in jail for criminal harassment, if you ask me (he has been arrested for trespassing on Buzz Aldrin's property).  The men who were fooled into letting him into their very own homes for an interview almost have to use force to get him and his cameraman to leave.

Sibrel even exploits his well-deserved smack in the chops form Buzz Aldrin by replaying it several times in slow-motion (and playing it up for the buffoon he is on the cover of this video).  Buzz really gets the worst treatment of all the Apollo astronauts, as Sibrel blatantly calls him a liar to his face.  This is one of those rare cases when a punch in the mouth is, in my opinion, wholly justified.  Personally, I would have liked to see him - or anyone else - beat the crap out of Sibrel for an hour or two.  Poor Edgar Mitchell is as kind and cooperative a gentleman as you're likely to find, as evidenced by the initial parts of Sibrel's ""interview"" in Mitchell's home, but he is incensed at the end because this fool, who lied to him about the purpose of the interview, keeps egging him on and refusing multiple requests to leave.

Sibrel's smoking gun is more like a little cap gun without the caps.  It's just a piece of long-available ""secret footage"" (shown on live TV in July 1969, no less) from  Apollo 11 which, according to Sibrel, shows the astronauts using a filter to make the Earth appear farther away that it really was.  That and his spiel about Van Allen Belt radiation is all he has.  Clearly, all this man wants is attention and some kind of ill-gotten fame, and he's willing to lie and deceive to get it.  An honorable man does not respond to a punch from a great American hero by immediately turning and asking the cameraman if he caught it on tape.  Bart Sibrel - no matter what he might choose to hawk - has no credibility or integrity whatsoever.

8087498,1,B000BJKWP8,"Imagine you connive your way into someone's home under the pretense of doing a legitimate interview, and after asking them to describe an extremely unusual set of experiences, you throw your own heavy-handed religious beliefs at them and call them a liar.

This is what Sibrel does to Gene Cernan, Ed Mitchell and Alan Bean. Rude doesn't begin to describe it.

I have personally never met an Apollo astronaut. I have always wanted to, and now, having seen how all of these gentlemen showed such patience with this guy after he attacked them IN THEIR HOMES, I now see another way in which they are great role models.

In other segments, astronauts Aldrin and Collins are attacked unprepared on the street, and Sibrel gets a more visceral, more deserved reaction.

I personally also find Sibrel's religion to be very intrusive, and not at all helpful to his hopeless case.  Asking Buzz Aldrin how he thinks he's getting into heaven without ""repenting"" is just plain insulting, both to Aldrin (famously Catholic), and the viewer, regardless of what faith they may or may not belong to.

It's one thing to be a loony fringe conspiracy theorist, but another thing entirely to be an aggressive jackass.  Give it a rest, Bart.",1180224000,27,1219,4.831730769230769
8087499,1,B000BJKWP8,"""Astronauts Gone Wild"" is the latest crockumentary (One can't call this film a documentary) from producer/director Bart Sibrel where he again tries to prove that no one has ever walked on the moon and that NASA faked all of the moon landings.  Similar to his previous offering ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon,"" where he misinterprets data, lies to the viewer and hides facts, in this offering he stalks the Apollo moonwalkers and tries to get them to answer some questions, but he first deceives them into giving him an interview.  Specifically, he sneaks up of each one then asks them to swear on the Bible that they walked on the Moon and then calls them liars, cheats and frauds.  As one would expect the responses are varied.  Some astronauts curse him, some just laugh and call him an idiot and others resort to a physical attack.  Of course the viewer is treated to the famous Buzz Aldrin's punch to the jaw of Bart Sibrel.  As usual he again misinterprets data, lies to the viewer and hides facts, sometimes with editing and sometimes with not showing the viewer the entire story.

The film opens with selected short clips from his encounters with various astronauts and this was the only part of the entire DVD that I found even remotely enjoyable.  In this section, the viewer sees Bart get punched by Buzz Aldrin, kicked in the rear by Edgar Mitchell, threatened by John Young, called a liar by Neil Armstrong and cursed by Alan Bean, Gene Cernan and a host of others (Mike Collins, Al Worden, Frank Borman).  It was so nice to see a man in his 30's get pummeled by 70 year old men.

In this extremely cheap production quality video, there are three different types of interviews.  In the first type of interview which lasts for several minutes, four astronauts are asked a series of questions about their missions.  He then he asks them about his ""secret, classified, footage"" from NASA showing the ""Apollo 11 astronauts faking the moon landings.""  After Bart springs this footage these men and basically calls them liars, as one would expect, a confrontation erupts.

It should be noted that this is the same footage that one can see in his first crockumentary, ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon,"" so the viewer is not getting anything new.  Furthermore this clip has never been secret and is available (and has been for years) to the general public.

For the second type of interview, Bart tries his hand at ambush journalism.  In these two cases, he confronts John Young and Neil Armstrong.  John Young is as classic as ever, telling Bart that he will knock him to the deck.  Neil Armstrong realizes that Bart is trying to trick him and doesn't go any further.

The third type of interview is just simple and poor attempts at ambush journalism and all that he has are a few seconds of film with the astronauts telling him to leave them alone.

Just like his previous failure at trying to prove to prove a moon hoax, he again lies to the viewer, hides facts, sometimes with poor editing, and does not tell the viewer the entire story.  The interview with Gene Cernan is a perfect example.  During the course of the interview, you see that Gene Cernan starts to sweat.  With the camera angles and the subsequent editing, the viewers cannot miss it.  Of course, the idea promoted here is that if he is sweating profusely he must be lying.  Here's what Bart doesn't tell you, he filmed this interview in Cernan's un air-conditioned backyard cabana (you get a glimpse of this at the end of the interview clip), and it is summertime in Houston where temperature and humidity are both above 90 (I live in Houston as does Cernan so I recognize the summer foliage), so of course he hides that fact.  One thing that Bart does not show you is himself or the cameraman, so one cannot judge if the sweating is due to the heat and humidity or not.  Unfortunately, Bart is not a good editor/producer and if you step through this section of the DVD, you get a brief glimpse of him and he is covered in sweat just like Cernan.  Once again, he is caught deceiving the public again.

My final thought is save your money and a buy a book or a movie that is written by people who understand science and engineering and is not trying to deceive you and take your money.",1173139200,35,4289,4.546875
