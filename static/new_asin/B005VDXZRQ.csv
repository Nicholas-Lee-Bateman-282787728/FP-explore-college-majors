8487426,5,B005VDXZRQ,"Love Came For Me is a wonderful Christmas program carried very nicely by Shannon Wexelberg. Shannon's vocals are beautiful, and the lyrics of the songs are so rich with meaning. There is a depth of meaning to the message of Love Came For Me. The narrator and the guests explain the message of Christmas in the context of the gospel message--God's redeeming work in the death of His Son on Calvary's Cross. Great way to introduce family and friends to the true meaning of Christmas.",1440028800,,481,4.670588235294118
