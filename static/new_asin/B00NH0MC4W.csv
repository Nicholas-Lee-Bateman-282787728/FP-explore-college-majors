6655212,5,B00NH0MC4W,"Brilliant end to a truly Great Series, this show ranks as one of my all time favorites the cast the writing the directing and the production are among some of the best on all of tv.  Season 5 was short but worked perfectly with the flashbacks and it all led up to an absolutely amazing finale episode an nearly flawless final scene.",1414627200,,332,4.354838709677419
6655213,3,B00NH0MC4W,"At the final scene, I had the same puzzled look as Nucky Thompson.  Sort of, ""Wha'?""  After such powerful storytelling in the first four seasons, the final season was almost a separate show with a set of characters I did not find very interesting.  All the hype about ""everyone goes down and it will be ugly"" must have been tabled.  Not that I crave blood and gore, but really needed more closure and less flashback explanation of how Nucky evolved from a sweet abused kid to a psycho.  Steve Buscemi deserved a better script.  What about Margaret and her children?  What about Richard's wife?  We can assume Nucky's brother takes his cash and goes back to his family.  They killed off all the wrong characters and without the usual analysis that followed other episodes.  Sorry, HBO, but this didn't work!",1414627200,4,806,4.692857142857143
6655214,3,B00NH0MC4W,"I've really enjoyed watching ""Boardwalk Empire."" Even a mediocre episode of it beat most of the dreck that network tv has to offer. I own all four seasons on DVD and for the sake of completeness, I will get season five when that becomes available. I also know that what I write here is just my own opinion and some people I'm sure won't agree with it.

But I feel sad that Boardwalk Empire ended the way it did.  Too many things that should have been taken note by the show were left out when it was cancelled (note:  I do not believe for a minute that HBO and the showrunner Winter intended the series to end after 4 and two thirds seasons).

-the Atlantic City Conference
-Arnold Rothstein's death
-the Stock Market Crash
-Capone's rise to the very pinnacle of power
-Nuck's wheeling and dealings in Florida and Havana

Also, the time jump introduced holes in the plot or widened ones that opened in season 4.

<spoilers>

--How did Chalky White wind up on the chain gang? He was a powerful man who ruled the North Side but after a couple of clashes with Narcisse, he goes on the lam and winds up in jail with no explanation.  Also his decision to not kill Narcisse (who wound up getting killed in the finale) in return for a vague promise that Narcisse would set Daughter Maitland ""free"" seemed awfully passive (and suicidal) and unlike the fighter Chalky had been shown to be.

--Willie Thompson's evolution into a ""good guy"" was implausible. This was someone who (accidentally) poisoned one of his fellow students and let his roommate and friend go to prison for that. I don't doubt that there are people in real life who could do that and not lose any sleep over it. I'm totally unconvinced that someone doing that would apparently sincerely talk about how crime is a great evil and enlist to be a crusader against it.

--It's also hard for me to see Nucky having very much sympathy left for Gillian. He may not be aware that she tried to have him killed through Gyp Roseti (which led to the death of his girlfriend Billie) but he was certainly aware that she was part and parcel of the plot against him in season 2. It's also hard for me to feel any sympathy for Gillian like the show was trying to instill. Remember she was someone who murdered in cold blood a young man simply because she needed a patsy to fake the death of her son so she could inherit his estate. Yes, Nucky did something terrible to her, but I am certain the very large percentage of victims of child molesters don't commit first degree murder of someone with no connection to that.

--Luciano and Lansky's rise to power was jarring and unpersuasive. At the end of season 4, they were still junior men. In season five, they are depicted as being far more powerful with virtually no explanation as to why (if there had been an additional season this could have been shown and substantiated).

<end spoilers>

Because of these reasons, I think it's laughable to claim the show wound up on time and according to plan. I find myself wondering why Boardwalk Empire didn't move through the era of Prohibition at a faster clip than it did in the first four seasons (about a year to a year and a half for each). At that pace, Boardwalk Empire would have needed at least eight seasons to cover the era ... which would have required the show to exceed the Sopranos in terms of popularity. They should have covered three years between the seasons and plotted accordingly.

<spoilers on the ending of the final episode>

Nucky's fate ... gunned down by Jimmy Darmody's son Tommy (played by an actor much older than the character would have been) was deeply unsatisfying to me.  For one thing, it was truly unoriginal.  It must be some sort of cosmic rule that an anti-hero like Nucky, Tony Soprano, or Walter White has to meet with a bad end.  For the life of me, I can't understand why Nucky couldn't have had a fate more like the real life historical figure that inspired the character.  Nucky Johnson went to jail for a few years, got out, and lived to a ripe old age (dying in 1968 as a beloved Atlantic City icon).  They could have had Nucky go off to jail and get out and see the world had passed him by.  But no, they had to kill him.

And the way he was killed was stupid.  Tommy Darmody would have been 13 or 14 years old in 1931.  He had last seen his grandma Gillian in 1924 and had already forgotten his real mother and probably his father.  Moreover, he was taken to Wisconsin to be raised by Harrow's widow and Harrow's sister.  I think the idea he would have remembered very much of anything his ""mee-mah"" told him about Nucky made no sense.

And then there's the fact that Tommy had multiple opportunities to kill Nucky before the final one where he did.  And the fact that his opportunity to do so came as the result of a series of flukes that he could have never have predicted.

So I was deeply unsatisfied with the ending of a memorable character like Nucky.  If they were going to kill him, it would have been better to have shown him getting killed right when he thought he had triumphed once again.  Instead he was killed at the lowest ebb of his life.

But I know some people loved the ending as ""poetic justice"" for Nucky and they have the right to feel that way.  But I'd only ask them what is so poetic about Tommy Darmody blowing Nucky away on the Boardwalk (and doing so in front of two federal agents which would have likely gotten him life in prison if not execution).

If they had to have Tommy Darmody confront Nucky, they could have had him simply say, ""I was going to kill you but you're not worth it"" and just walk away.

Sigh",1414368000,88,5629,4.395371263259402
6655215,5,B00NH0MC4W,"A short season, but jammed full of exposition. HBO was probably wise in not trying to milk seasons 6 & 7 out of the actors (or it could just be that contracts were up or Steve Buscemi got tired of the role). The screenwriters keep you guessing about the fates of characters in Season 5; while some line up with history, others don't. Would this final season of Boardwalk Empire have been better had it more closely matched history, especially in the case of Enoch Johnson? Probably not, and you can always read a history book if you want the story to continue.

As in The Sopranos, there was the ever-present background question that lingered in each season, but especially in Season 5: Is it true that ""Crime doesn't pay""? Turns out that's up for the viewer to decide. Obviously being crooked can pay the bills and then some in the short-term, but what about a few years down the road? The closing season of Boardwalk Empire helps you form an answer, albeit a tentative one; comeuppances are unevenly dealt out amongst the characters we've come to know over the past few years. The final episode leaves the viewer having to imagine what awaits those who make it out alive. While the writers did a satisfactory job of tidying up loose ends, all we can do now if we want more Nucky is look to history for an ending.",1414368000,3,1314,4.497907949790795
6655216,3,B00NH0MC4W,"I just got done watching the "" Finale"" last night(0ct,26,2014) and was hoping that maybe they go on to another season(eventually)...hey they(HBO) did it with other programming(ie,Deadwood and Sopranos)......both those shows got such a big turnout for another season that HBO obiged...I was thinking while watching maybe a Joe Kennedy sequel....one can dream can they not ?........LOL ..........""The Toad"".......Out.......",1414368000,,421,6.1525423728813555
6655217,5,B00NH0MC4W,"Absolutely stunning conclusion to a beautiful series. SPOILER ALERT:
-
-
-
-
Unlike another phenomenal series, The Sopranos, Boardwalk chose to meld artistry and full circle story-telling. The place where Nucky first lost his soul would be the final place his soul would depart this life. No less by a character forgotten: Jimmy's son. That Gillian was left to languish in a mental institution as opposed to being rescued was only natural: Nucky has always been a selfish man and even in the twilight of his years, he could only find compassion and not action to save someone that offered him nothing but guilt and a reminder of his betrayal. Gillian, a woman perpetually used by society's scoundrels and power-brokers, did not come out on top, which is a contrast to Margaret. A woman that tried to do right in life and felt guilt over her sins, despite having all of the reasons Gillian did to be deceitful, bitter and ""sinful"" (in that day in age).

The tale was spun so beautifully from the beginning with an amazing conclusion that should leave any fan satisfied. Knocked it out the park.",1414368000,5,1093,4.722513089005235

6655222,1,B00NH0MC4W,"Stop at season four where Boardwalk empire was one of the best series ever produced. Something must have occurred to force them to cancel the show. Despite the producer claiming they were not trying to make sure every criminal got what was coming for a life of crime, that's exactly what they did. No happiness anywhere. At least with Breaking Bad and Sopranos we had characters we could feel good about their future. Beyond the boring predictable every bad person gets killed story line where rushed flashbacks, a son of Tommy who killed Nucky to avenge his father, who he rarely saw, was responsible for his mother's murder, and attempted to kill Nucky.
 My entire time watching the series, I enjoyed knowing Nucky (and Lucky Luciano and Meyer) all lived (as well as Capone's death). The writers decided in that ONE area, to sway from reality. Ignorant.",1523059200,,855,4.816326530612245

6655231,2,B00NH0MC4W,"Season 5 tries to fill in the gaps of seasons 1-4. I am not sure the direction they went was necessary. The non linear storytelling, the young Nucky having ridiculously fake teeth to emulate Buscemi looked more like halloween vampire teeth than the actual man himself. They should have left it alone.

I don't mean to sound like I didn't enjoy the whole series, but season 5 should have been different than this. its as if they didn't know what to do with themselves so they back filled the story with things that we all pretty much already knew, told in detail that I am not sure anyone would have cared about so late in the story. Had the memories and flashbacks played out through the previous 4 seasons and not crammed into 8 episodes I think it would have been better.

One really annoying part of this prequel diversion is that, while they cast an actor who looked like a younger Steve Buscemi, they had him wear these ridiculous looking fake teeth that were as poorly fitted as the old plastic vampire fangs you can buy around Halloween. In some scenes, he's wearing some really big teeth, so big that he can barely talk around them, while in other scenes they are a smaller version. What sticks in the memory is that, at times, he had these huge fangs jutting out of his mouth that were a caricature of Buscemi's slightly prominent teeth.  It was a very poor idea on the part of whoever came up with it.

6655299,3,B00NH0MC4W,"This season kept jumping back to Nuckys childhood life and his adult life. I think this could have been done in season 1.  The first season thru the 4th was pretty action packed and/or interesting (could do with less sex).  The 5th was pretty slow and boring.  I have to say the ending was quite unexpected though.  I think season 5 could have been done in one episode instead of 8.  Was it worth 25 bucks, not really but at least the first four seasons were free (if you had prime).  So I guess that kind of makes it easier to swallow.",1491350400,,536,4.205882352941177

If you want to see season 5 you'll have to pay for it. Pretty sneaky on their part.

6655315,5,B00NH0MC4W,"Possibly the best series that I have ever watched right up there with deadwood. The hardest part about it is knowing how wonderful our country was just a few years ago, the architecture, automobiles, fashion, segregation, absence of ridiculous firearms laws, available narcotics over the counter, minimal police, beautiful women that actually acted like women should, men that were men unlike all of these confused hipsters and trannys of today, legal opium dens, heroin that was very available and very affordable unlike today thanks to our governments greatest mistake the war on drugs. We barely missed it but so much has changed since the days of being able to order a legal Thompson sub machine gun from a catalog and have it delivered to your house without having to pay the price of a new car for one all while begging the government to allow you to exercise a God given right to do so.

6655323,3,B00NH0MC4W,"First of all I enjoyed watching this series.  The setting and characters were very convincing; it took me back to the early 1920's and prohibition, That said, the fifth season was a let down compared to the first four seasons not because of bad character performance; they were just as good in the fifth season as they were in previous seasons.  The writing was just bad with all of usually closing season tricks (flash forwards, flash backs, character and scene analysis before and at the end of each episodes).  Come on, just get on with the show! Stop with the cinematic tricks, they are a distraction which lessened the value of the entire series.  I got to watch the fifth season for free through a trial run of ""HBO Now"".  Thank god!  I would have felt cheated if I had to pay $24,99 to watch the fifth and final season.",1486598400,3,826,4.473333333333334

I feel like I got my money out of renting this last season. Plus I was able to binge it and when it was over - I was a little sad to not have it to watch!

6655448,5,B00NH0MC4W,"Thrilling! Overall, I enjoy it for what it was. An interesting assortment of characters with absolutely no time to flush them out fully. The production was obviously rushed due to impending cancellation. One cannot always assume that there will be time for growth. In the convoluted world of television, it is best to go for the jugular from the start. Spending too much on time any given storyline can be costly. Especially, when it may not factor in the end result. A crying shame!",1482278400,,483,4.761904761904762
6655449,5,B00NH0MC4W,"I own all five seasons. Great final Season for a very good series; includes back-stories about characters/events that I often wondered about. I'm glad they weren't presented during the five season run. Buscemi's role is like no other he ever had, and he plays it well. I always found him amusing, but I guess it proves you can't be funny if you can't act in the first place. The series gave me a clearer idea of the Prohibition Era, and how it truly played or had a greater affect on the present. The five seasons used were just the right amount of time to make this enjoyable. It grabbed me in the beginning, I never tired of it or any characters and ended in a way I didn't expect.  Includes actors who I'd only seen in minor roles or films that may not have been award winning, prior to this show,  who prove to actually have talent .Made me wonder why these actors were never bigger. Martin Scorcese, who's proved he knows what he's doing - directed, I believe - Mark Wahlberg produced - need I say more? Not sure who did the casting but glad they chose these actors for their roles.",1482278400,,1087,4.349753694581281

6655586,3,B00NH0MC4W,"This is a disappointing finale to what was an outstanding gangster melodrama.  Not only is the plot line confusing - 6 years have passed but little is explained clearly about the characters' situations - but (sorry for the spoiler) what happens is that just about everyone gets bumped off or otherwise incarcerated in their own particular episode.  Karma, I suppose, for past sins.  I did think the flashbacks work very well, both in acting and theme, indeed they were the best part of the season.  They added to the narrative arc and, at least to me, did not feel contrived.

However, this season is directed in such a confusing manner, without adequate explanation, that sometimes you are not sure what is a flashback and what is the present.  For example, Chalky is in a Louisiana chain gang.  For most of the episode, I wasn't sure if it was a flashback or not.  Then, all the abrupt ends for so many central characters!  It didn't work for me, in spite of the attempts at psychological realism.

While I know enough mafia history to fill in the gaps on the historical figures, for those who don't know all that, it will be confusing to many viewers, I suspect.  This is a poor way to end the series.  But then, already the 4th season was a bit much for me, like it was losing its steam and just became a shoot-em-up gang war.  I would recommend this for aficionados, but not for the casual viewer.",1474934400,,1402,4.515873015873016

We get to see Nucky's childhood life revealed and how it drove him to be the man he is.  The show returns to more Atlantic City action and is not as dark as season 3.  The characters show more of their human frailties and you see the world in the depression era.  A grand season to end this fantastic show.",1474848000,,427,4.3544303797468356

6655608,1,B00NH0MC4W,"A SORRID ending to a teriffic series. I watched every episode from Episode 1 Season 1 to the last season. It was obvious during Season 4 that the producers did not want to put any more resources into the series, so they started reassigning writers to develop the series ""Vinyl"" (which turned out to be a DUD). After the 3rd or 4th episode of season 4 the writing kept getting worse and worse until you had exchanges like this: (Knock on door...Chalky: ""Who dat?"" ...Purnsley: ""It me."")

SPOILER ALERTS: There are a lot of ways to end a series. You can leave things open which leaves the possibility of rebooting the series sometimes in the future. That requires writers with skill and they had all left Boardwalk Empire by then. The other way is to kill off every last character. A solution so simple that any moron could write it. I'll let you guess which one they decided to go with. Such a shame. Season 1, 2 and 3 were incredible television, among the best I've ever seen.",1473984000,,976,4.48314606741573

6655628,4,B00NH0MC4W,"The fifth and final season of BOARDWALK EMPIRE turned out to be a truncated affair with only eight episodes; just enough time for producer Martin Scorsese, director Tim Van Patten and writher Terence Winter to close the show, strike the tent and hit the road with most of the story lines wrapped up.  There finished up with most of the main characters and doled out their various fates after a time jump in the action from the mid 1920s to the summer of 1931.  The Roaring 20s have given way to the Great Depression and the end of Prohibition is in sight and the men who have gotten rich from bootlegging are now making plans for the inevitable repeal.  This includes Nucky Thompson, who along with his partner, Sally Wheat, has made more than a little scratch running liquor through Atlantic City, but Nuckys longtime enemies in NYC, Charlie Luciano and Meyer Lansky have risen high in the ranks of organized crime and are looking to take over and eliminate the competition.  Other familiar faces such as Chalky White, Gillian Darmody, and Nuckys brother, Eli, have fallen on hard times indeed, while in Chicago, Al Capones days at the top are numbered.

But as a faithful viewer and fan of BOADWALK EMPIRE right through to the final episode, it felt as if the talent behind the camera had just given up on the show in season five, especially in the scenes sit in 1931; there was something utterly perfunctory in the way Sally, Chalky, Nelson Van Alden, Dr. Narcisse, and Mickey Doyle just go to their fates and with not much satisfaction.  Sally certainly deserved better; I don't buy it that somebody as scrappy as Chalky would end up on a chain gang and then willingly walk into a trap; and Van Alden should have ended up stuck with his dreadful wife for the rest of his life, a much more just end than the one he received. The creators clearly threw out much of their own back story, as with Ben Rosenfields Willie Thompson, whos now a straight arrow young lawyer despite the fact that he inadvertently murdered a fellow student back in college and willingly pinned the responsibility for the act on a friend who went to jail. Then there is Tommy Darmody, who is conveniently aged a couple of years.  At least Eli Thompson gets a chance to go home and make it up to his family. Only Margaret Thompson appears to have prospered, shes working on Wall Street and appears to have come into her own after a lucrative partnership with the late Arnold Rothstein.

To me, the biggest letdown comes with the way they handled Nucky Thompsons last story arc, especially its resolution.  I agree with everyone who says there is no way the Nucky that we saw in the second and third seasons would ever allow himself to be boxed into a corner in such a way by Luciano and Lansky; he was always far too cunning and intelligent for such a thing to happen; that after a decade of building up his criminal operation in Atlantic City, and defending it with such murderous fury, he would never simply give up on the spur of the moment and hand it all over to men he despised.  This rings totally false; so does his final confrontation with the vengeful Tommy Darmody, who sure took his time waiting around to reveal his real identity to the, heretofore, perceptive Nucky, whom I am sure would have recognized Jimmys son and Gillians grandson on first sight. By giving us a story line about the young Nucky and his early days in Atlantic City, including fateful encounters with a teenaged Gillian and the Commodore, the writers were trying to give the series a sense of poetic justice at the end, but to me, all they gave us was the same kind of ending Warner Brothers used to give James Cagney back in their old gangster epics.  This was HBO and they should have done something better and more ambitious, like giving us the old Nucky who would have talked Tommy into giving him the gun and then taking him under his wing, maybe out of sense of late in the day guilt for what he did to Jimmy and Gillian.  There could have been a flash forward to 60s where wed learn that Nucky had become a figure in Atlantic City not unlike the Commodore, one who died wealthy and esteemed with a park named for him and his criminal past conveniently forgotten.  America was built by bad men as much good ones, the series should have said, and they deserved to be remembered.  Thats how I see it anyway.

The one thing Season 5 did get right were the scenes concerning the young Nucky and his rise from poor kid to Sheriff; it explained how he came to be the man we knew in the previous four seasons.  This part of the show really did engage the writers enthusiasm.  Marc Pickering was perfect as the young Nucky Thompson, determined to escape his wretched childhood and make something of himself by grasping any opportunity which came his way; so too John Conlee, whose performance as the middle aged Commodore perfectly echoed Dabney Colemans evil old man.

And right to the end, Steve Buscemi gave it his all, creating a fascinating character, one the audience could understand, even when he was at his most despicable. One of my favorite scenes comes in the finale when he gets a glimpse at the future by witnessing a demonstration of primitive television. The rest of the cast never faltered despite the less than great scripts: Michael Shannon, Shea Whigam, Anatol Yusaf, Vincent Piazza, Gretchen Mol, Jeffrey Wright, Stephen Graham, Michael Kenneth Williams, and Paul Sparks will never do better work than what they did on BOARDWALK EMPIRE; I even warmed up to Kelly McDonalds Margaret once she learned to stand on her own two feet.

I have no doubt that in ten years or so, BOARDWALK EMPIRE will be discovered by new viewers and those too young to have caught it the first time around and they will wonder why this show was not a bigger hit or why its not considered one of TVs classics.  I think the producers made a mistake in pacing the show too slowly in the first few seasons, covering only the early to mid 20s; as it was, we never got to see the dramatic 1928 Presidential election between dry Herbert Hoover and wet Al Smith or the events leading up to the Stock Market crash in 1929.  I also think the show was a victim of the binge watch era and simply could not grab a large enough audience on a weekly basis.

Still, I will give even this final season four stars, for BOARDWALK EMPIRE was always a great recreation of history.  The Roaring 20s, as it became known, burned bright with its music, fashions, crime and corrupt politics, and most of all, Prohibition; it was like nothing ever seen before in America; yet no era would fade into irrelevance faster as the Great Depression and the World War that followed changed everything irrevocably; so much so that when THE UNTOUCHABLES, a TV show which covered much of the same events as BOARWALK, premiered in 1959, it would seem as quaint as GUNSMOKE and WAGON TRAIN.

While watching this final season, I did come to a conclusion about the surreal opening credits scene, the one where Nucky stands on the beach and calmly smokes a cigarette while the surf rose over his expensive shoes and the ocean fills up with floating whiskey bottles as the sky turns stormy.  I believe the whole sequence was a dream Nucky had on the eve of Prohibition, warning him of the strife to come, a warning he ignores as he strides back through the sand to the kingdom he rules.

So farewell to Nucky and the gang in Atlantic City, you were good company while it lasted.",1473206400,2,7489,4.537091988130563

From what little I know of Al Capone, the actor who portrays him does a good job. All around good movie. Everything from fashion design to set design to music selection unique dialect/slang used during this era is all very accurate.

There is a lot of excitement and real character development.  It's written exceeding well.  What else do you expect from Martin Scorsese who was the executive producer. The attention to detail in making it look as if it were right out of the twenties and thirties is exceptional.

The gangster life is entertaining, and we learn much about the Prohibition shortcomings who made men like Joe Kennedy rich beyond belief.  The portrayal of the young Al Capone and Meyer Lanskey  are also enlightening and entertaining.  I enjoyed every single episode of this.  Even though Nucky is a gangster and has committed murder, the movie still shows us the soft side by his generosity, ability to love his children, and his love for his women.

6655875,4,B00NH0MC4W,Season 5 features a more introspective Nucki and the overall feel of this season is darker than previous ones.  The writing and acting are all first rate.

6655877,5,B00NH0MC4W,"Must see for gangster and prohibition era movie fans. Binge watched over a one month period. Very well done and addicting. This show was so underrated. Enough real history to make it almost like a documentary. Perfect production and acting all around. The periods are replicated in exact detail, all the way down to the music, cars, props, sets and decor. Thought it was fascinating how it brought historical figures and events that I had read about to life: Al Capone,  Lucky Luciano,  Arnold Rothstein, Johnny Torrio, George Remus ... a dozen more. Even Joe Kennedy. I'm fascinated by organized crime and especially it's role in prohibition. There is some serious violence but it's not gratuitous or overly graphic. But even the most violent of the characters (Al Capone) showed moments of tenderness and compassion. As real as it could be. Everything clicked like clockwork. The final season was a perfect wrap-up. No complaints at all from me. If all shows were this well done I would hardly ever extricate myself from my TV.",1464825600,,1029,4.908045977011494

It is a brilliant piece of drama in every regard - in terms of painting a compelling portrait of a turbulent and tumultuous time in our Nation's history, as well as developing complex characters who were caught up in the frenetic wave of the Ballyhoo years.

Steve Buscemi gives an outstanding  performance as Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson. The hook is probably set by the end of the first season so that you will want to purchase the last 2 of the 5 seasons from Amazon to finish the tale. There are enough twists in the plot to keep you guessing how will they get out of this one.  By the end of the series, you will probably fall in love with the bad guy as you understand the circumstances of what made the man.

I like how they reflected back on Nucky's childhood and the beginning of things in this season.  Great series.

Williams (""Chalky""), Gretchen Moll ""Gillian,"" and/or Michael Shannon (Van Alden) as opposed to the guys who played Benny and Willie (as was the case with one commentary).

6656193,5,B00NH0MC4W,"First off, my 5 star rating is for the young actor who portrays ""the young 20ish Nucky Thompson."" Sheer acting genius. This man deserves an Emmy! He looks like him, his demeanor, way of speaking and moving are dead-on Steve Buscemi playing Nucky Thompson! I also gave it 5 stars because like another writer said, and I quote ""even a dud episode of Boardwalk Empire is far better than the brain dead sludge network TV puts out!"" Okay, I added a little sting to it. Yes, I too and very disappointed at the 1/2 ass'd way HBO and the producers of Boardwalk ended a genius TV series. It took me a while to find it online, but the answer is the producers were eager to wrap things up to start a new series (it will have a 1970s rock-n-roll business theme). Ya know fellas, karma might get you and your new TV series might be a collossal flop. The time jump 7 years ahead, killing off ole Nucky were all mistakes. It really is a crying shame. Season 5 is not awful, just a disappointment at only 8 episodes and time jumping 7 years to 1931.",1440979200,,1033,4.275510204081633

6656227,5,B00NH0MC4W,"This is very well done series that attempts to be as true as possible to the 1920s era of insanity, commonly known as Prohibition. It demonstrates, just as clearly as our failed war on drugs, today, how criminalizing (by law) products that countless millions of Americans use, only empowers huge criminal empires and encourages corruption in government, all at the expense of safety, individual liberty, lost / lawful tax revenues, and common sense. At the center of the story is young Irish boy, who grew up poor, and learned how to seize both power and opportunity, by captitalizing on foolish laws, greed, and the insatiable demand of the public for alcohol. In doing so, ""Nucky"" Thompson, a politician / gangster, from Atlantic City, NJ, realizes that he can depend on almost no one, other than himself, and becomes a particularly ruthless and efficient businessman / murderer. Although he will form alliances, off and on, with well known historical figures, such as Al Capone and others, in the end, Nucky's independent streak will spell his bittersweet political, business, and personal demise. Well worth watching. The violence is graphic and unapologetic. Ditto for the gritty sexuality. The politics of sin, stupidity, violence, and the tragic cost of laws gone insane, all eloquently and personally detailed, in this retro-extroidinaire of a series, featuring countless outstanding performances.",1438819200,8,1405,5.304932735426009

6656235,1,B00NH0MC4W,Wow. I am so sorry I spent money for this.  It was a huge disappointment after the first few.  I'd say the writers/directors went downhill steeply after the first three.

Firstly not only did they cut the Series down from it's intended 7 Seasons to only 5, but then the 5th Season consists of only 8 episode, rather than the usual 12.

Boardwalk Empire's first three seasons were great and for them the series is one of the greats I've seen. But the fourth season had ups and downs. The fifth and final season was very good untill the last two episodes. The main problem was the ending of the main characters. It didn't make sense on most of them and it was disrespectful and out of character for the majority. Characters as strong and beloved as Richard (stupid death), Chalky (""suicide"" for a woman he haven't seen for years, with no guarantees and letting the hated Narcisse alive when he could have killed him) and Nucky (I understand the circle thing, what he did came back to him, but no, it wasn't like him).
I would have killed Richard in a shoot out or let him live a new life (he deserved it) with his sister, wife and Tommy. Chalky should have killed Narcisse and then the doctor's bodyguards could have killed him. Nucky would never have surrendered that stupid way to Luciano. It was humilliating for the central character of the series. And if he did that it would have been strategically. If he was going out, he would have been killed in a shootout between his gang and Luciano's. Or surrendering and then killing them all and retiring, leaving Tommy at command later. Or killing them all and then going to jail. But not like this.
Plus, we don't know what happens to Margaret, Eli and Gillian. And we never saw Arnold's death, Luciano's returning to Masseria, the St. Valentine's massacre or Capone in jail.
The title of the final season is ""No one goes quietly"". Nucky did. The series did. Many series end with a dissapointment. This is one of them.",1432339200,2,1658,4.585858585858586

Staying ahead of the competition drives much of the plot and luck favours few as those left standing take full control. By the end there are few unanswered questions and the fate of key and minor characters all become known.

Only part I didn't understand was why a series from two years ago still wasn't considered as a Prime membership series..maybe because it was *that* good?? I certainly am not going to give away the ""plot"" to this series, but we throughly enjoyed it. Seeing the New Jersey boardwalk; the way it was during the 1920's when it was ""speakeasy joints"" and alcohol was illegal (wish it still was), the style of clothing, the beautiful furnishings, what the weathly homes looked like, how things were done was so well recreated. If you want to kick back and don't mind having to pay to watch; this one is worth the money. (extremely addicting to just relax and enjoy, but everytime you think you know what is going to possibly happen next; something totally jaw-dropping usually took place.

6656325,3,B00NH0MC4W,"I loved Boardwalk Empire, and so I found myself very much let down by this, the final season.  The first four seasons were all great, a perfect combination of marvelous writing and outstanding performances by a truly remarkable cast.  But something, I don't know what, went terribly wrong for the show when it came to wrapping things up in the fifth season.

So many things seem to have been bad decisions for no apparent reason.  For one thing, they jumped ahead five years, from 1926 to 1931, completely bypassing a number of key events like the election of 1928, the stock market collapse of 1929, the death of Arnold Rothstein who was a key character in the show, and others.  For another, the season was noticeably short, 8 episodes instead of the usual 12. Another bad decision was the attempt to maintain all of the previous major character plot threads but with no real attempt to show what had happened over the last five years, while at the same time weaving in the background story of how Nucky came to be the man he was, with flashbacks to when he was a boy growing up in poverty in Atlantic City and to when he was a young man first getting his start up ladder. The result gave things a very choppy feel with the show jumping back and forth between no less than nine plot threads and between past and present as well.

That said, however, I must add that the flashback threads are far and away the best part of the season, not only because of the high quality writing but also because of the superb casting of the younger versions of the key characters of the show.  Nolan Lyons is a stand-out as Nucky as a young boy in 1884, conveying a boy determined to escape the poverty into which he was born but uncertain as to what the best path up is.  But Marc Pickering is a marvel as Nucky as a young man in 1897, managing a highly credible version of a younger Steve Buscemi, down to his way of speaking and physicality.  This in turn is complemented by John Ellison Conlee's younger and more physically vital version of the Commodore, with Ellison in turn managing a younger version of Dabney Coleman, down to the voice and facial expressions.  Together, their performances are truly compelling.

Recommended for the parts that show Nucky's past and his evolution, and for the parts dealing with Joseph Kennedy, but with the caution that the rest is mostly an incoherent let's-just-kill-everyone-off disappointment.",1430611200,12,2426,4.6055684454756385

6656386,5,B00NH0MC4W,"Since I don't have cable TV, I bought all five seasons and savored each episode.  The one word I would use to describe Boardwalk Empire - rich.  Rich in script and dialog, rich in set design, history, music of the era, writing, and extremely rich in cast and direction.  Every single actor/actress turned in outstanding performances.  Can't think of a single weak performance by any cast member, from the leads to the small roles.  Kudos to all the ladies who took off their clothes!  I even loved the music and downloaded many songs from the series.  I did not fathom how it would end, but I did suspect the final additional actor who seemed to be mission oriented.  Boardwalk Empire is the finest TV series I have ever watched.  And watch I did!  I had no problem following the plot, but I did watch each episode more than once, just to take in everything, the performances, the sets, the music, and of course, the action.  Steve Buscemi ALWAYS gives amazing performances and I have loved him especially in Coen Bros. movies.  Jack Huston as Richard Harrow was especially good.  Bobby Cannavale as Gyp Rosetti was evil incarnate and deserved an Emmy.  Loved Patricia Arquette, who is wonderful in anything.  Kelly McDonald was excellent and I enjoyed her character's development throughout.  The losses were hard, and I was SO sad when Richard Harrow (Jack Huston) left.

Boardwalk Empire is a TV treasure.  Glad I have the five seasons on disc because I know I will watch the entire thing again someday.",1427414400,,1506,4.726923076923077
6656387,5,B00NH0MC4W,Buscemi hits this one home.,1427414400,,27,4.6
6656388,5,B00NH0MC4W,"Its somewhat ironic that this final season of Boardwalk Empire is both the most epic in scope, and yet the shortest, at only 8 episodes.  Its a bold final season  not content with just following on from the previous year, 7 years have passed for the characters and we jump forward to 1931, close to the end of Prohibition.  This season doesnt simply tell the ongoing story, but equally tells the story of the young Nucky and his interaction with the other characters, explaining his beginnings in crime and interactions with other key characters from the series.
Its dazzling storytelling, as artfully shot as the rest of the season, and with all the high production values we have come to expect.  As ever, the acting is first class, there is never a moment when you don't believe these characters, and it is impossible to imagine someone else in the roles.  If there is a weakness with this season, it is that the main timeline with the older Nucky increasingly revolves around real life characters, or at least somewhat fictionalised versions of them.  This gives a feeling of both familiarity and predictability to their fate and the direction of the storyline.  Boardwalk Empire has always filled a storytelling void which has been relatively untouched  increasingly in this season it feels that it is treading more familiar ground and therefore drawing comparisons with other movies or series.  Al Capones story for example, increasingly draws comparisons with The Untouchables, and Lucky Lucianos story echoes scenes we associate with The Godfather, for example in the caf assassination scene.  No, the real treat of this season is how they manage to dig deeper than ever into what makes Nucky tick, a reminder that it is Nucky Thompson and Steve Buscemis portrayal of him that has been the driver propelling the success of this series.  Indeed, a couple more episodes to fill in more of those details would have been more than welcome, but who are we to complain when so few TV series have managed 5 seasons of such a consistently high standard of writing and production.
The resolution of the characters is more often tragic than it is upbeat  but it is satisfying that so many of the characters have been able to complete their arc given how short the season is.. it wuld have been great to see more, but in focussing on Nucky the tone of the series remains clear, and the theme of being faced with your past is an appropriate way to end.
So altogether, in spite of some niggles, its a glorious farewell.. well miss you, Boardwalk Empire.",1427414400,,2548,4.779043280182233

6656395,1,B00NH0MC4W,"Terrible from the first episode to the last, in season 5.  I was totally disappointed and felt cheated with that trite ending.  The season was a struggle to get through and the payoff for that, has me questioning if the whole series was worth it.  I had a family member ask me, if I would recommend the show to them.  I said ""probably not"".  Why?  Because, for a 5 season premium cable show, to go out with a total whimper and have a lame last episode, destroys all the great things done in the previous 4 seasons.  How could anyone honestly say, ""watch it, first 4 seasons are great, but the last one is painfully bad and the finale is laughable.""?

Although the last season was a challenge for me because of the time gap from the previous season, I think this was one of the best, tightest final seasons I have ever seen. They were all older, their lives were behind them, they had to pay for all of their past sins, but they sure did it with style.  They aged so realistically!  The ending knocked me over.  Although that young kid certainly reminded me of Jimmy Darmody, I didn't put it together. Who would have thought that Gillian would have triumphed in the end?  So many of the main characters said goodbye this season but it was smooth and did not feel contrived, like the final season of Sons of Anarchy (which was the worst final season in my opinion).  I am sad that Boardwalk Empire is over and really wish they had one more year.  We are so lucky that these programs exist and we are not at the mercy of network TV.

That said, what it did do, was tie up the stories of the main characters and provide some important back story for others. Lucky Thompson's life is shown quite effectively from a young boy to a young sheriff. The young actor who plays him during his career with the sheriff's department bears an uncanny resemblance and happens to be a very competent actor as well. After being largely missing last season, Margaret takes center stage again and manages to pull herself out of a bad situation very well. One of my favorite characters has always been Gillian. Not only do we find out what has happened to her, we get to see the story of her youth as well.

6656427,1,B00NH0MC4W,"I am only awarding one star for a number of reasons, one of which is the blu ray copy.  I bought the blu ray as Seasons 2 and 3 had the blu ray copy and a DVD, which was useful for watching in another room, and when my blu ray player died on me.  I  also I found the color more pleasing.  I don't care for the gimmicky online digital copy, tried it and don't have any reason to watch.  Season 4 and 5 did not have the DVD, nor was there any pop up trivia, which I find very useful and could certainly have done with to jog my memory of who was who, where the action was taking place, the history of  characters, and who the new ones were and how they fit into the story.  Quite frankly, I could have bought Season 5 for $10 less in DVD format and got the same.  When you add that Season 5 was 4 episodes fewer, I feel we got shortchanged by HBO.

That deals with the blu ray copy.  The other reasons for the low rating  are the rushed 'lets wind this up and get it over and done with' feel of the episodes, as if the writers had run out of steam.  So many events took place off screen and could have used an episode or two to depict.  How did Chalky end up on the chain gang for one?  How did he get from Havre Grace to prison?  What happened to his family? Arnold Rothstein died in 1928, but his murder only rated a quick mention.  As a major supporting player we deserved more.  Eli's time in exile.  After all the time they wasted on Margaret and her perpetual 'poor me' frown you would think they could have given us more of other characters.  Most of all, the stock market crash of 1929 could have used a whole episode and the fast glittering jazz age when everyone thought they were rich, or getting rich, came to a full stop.

The last disappointment was with the music, which had been the best part of the first four series and which deserved a separate music track of its own.  What happened?  Did they fire the person who selected the music?  I realize that the writers and creators may not have had the money and flexibility which they had at the start, as the studios tend to cut the budget of successful shows in the belief that they have captured the audience so why do they need to spend more money on hit.  (Star Trek was a good example.)  This explains why many shows which start out well end up as basket cases needing to be euthanized by later series.  I certainly hope they don't do this to Game of Thrones.  HBO may learn that this is not the way to build viewer loyalty.",1425686400,2,2492,4.095041322314049

6656462,1,B00NH0MC4W,"I am writing this review to strongly encourage anyone following Boardwalk Empire to stop at Season 4.  The final season is unquestionably one of the poorest, dullest and most unimaginative endings to any TV series I've ever seen let alone one that started with so much promise as this one.

Although it is true that throughout the series there were several preposterous sub-plots, these were largely banished to the background by the strong scripts and acting, unpredictable situations and meditative vignettes.  None of these strengths and subtleties are evident at any point in Season 5.  This season was clearly made with one intention - to get it completed as efficiently as possible and with minimum thought and effort.  Time was money.  And it shows.

There is a strong impression in Season 5 that everything needed to be ""wrapped up"" as quickly as possibly without considering what impact it may have had on the overall narrative.  Eli's son is a good example of this.  In earlier seasons, he is portrayed as someone with a strong sense of family bonds and who is eager to get into the ""family business"".  Yet in Season 5 we find him working at the attorney's office eagerly willing to take his family to the cleaners if need be!  That's quite a turnaround.

Another example of the rushed quality of ideas is the demise of several of the main characters.  True, they are bad people and have to die but their endings are executed in such perfunctory ways that seem strangely removed from their once authentic stories.  You cannot have four seasons of gradual character development and then simply remove them without producing elaborate reasons.  This rang particularly false for me.

And then there are the flashbacks to Nucky's youth.  A potentially good idea as this could have provided psychological insight into his motivations as well as to illustrate how bad decisions early in life can have resounding consequences many years later.  But again, this is a rushed idea never fully thought through by the show's creators.  After the final flashback we are left wondering why this was in there to begin with. What did it serve to illuminate about Nucky's life that we didn't know already?

The final scene is probably a business executive's idea of ""devastating"".  It is so predictable and weak that I cannot imagine anyone of any artistic bent being responsible for it. And yet there is something strangely appropriate about it's utter lack of impact and banality.  It is truly symbolic of the series as a whole.

I am angry and disappointed that a show that promised to be so much more could end it's life like this. If we are indeed living in a golden age of TV, future historians will not hold up Boardwalk Empire as an example.  This is no Breaking Bad or The Wire and yet the sadness here is that it really could have been.",1424908800,5,2839,4.770491803278689

6656485,5,B00NH0MC4W,"The final season answered all my questions from the previous 4 seasons. I was sorry that it ended because I wanted to see what happened with the gangsters who took over most of the territories when Capone went to jail for tax evasion. But maybe that could be the basis of a new series since Nucky's reign is now over. It was great seeing Steve Buscemi as a lead since he has always been so great in every part I have ever seen him in. This series was rich in detail and i was glad I bought it on Blu-Ray because both the sets and actors were excellent. So I hope there is a kind of follow-up with the characters still remaining from this series. However, if not, I will simply watch all 5 seasons of BOARDWALK EMPIRE again because it is not just a story, not just an experience, but a detailed analysis of violence as well. The Wild West may have been the defining characteristic of America in the 19th Century but this series and others like The Sopranos show that the ""Wild West"" continued well into the 20th Century. Maybe that is the essence of America...it is still the Wild West even today and it may never be completely civilised while money and guns rule. There is something seriously wrong with a nation that worships money. Here is that ethic for all to see! Fortunately, great artists like Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter analyse and reveal the problems faced by ordinary Americans when faced with a corrupt politic. But how can this ongoing cycle ever be changed when the ethic is so ingrained?",1424304000,,1509,4.471014492753623

From his early childhood up through to adulthood, all eight episodes go back in time.  While distracting at first, I am glad they told all of the past events since they definitely help shape the conclusion.

I'm not going to say this season is a huge ""upper.""

Go into it with the attitude that gangsters do bad things and sometimes, yes.  They pay for them.  This is the final act, but every story has one and I think this is one of the best endings to a gangster saga I have seen.  As usual, the acting and direction are all top notch as is the writing.  It's too bad it could not have gone further, but with so many real faces involved, there's only so much you can do without totally rewriting history.

Worked on me for Season 2 and then again for Season 3 and 4, but its the end of the road with Season 5. And just like the heroin in the show, once hooked raise the price on them. Season 5 price is a lower price, but wait its only 8 episodes. But that's fine as the quality of this show is better than anything you find on network. I will agree with another reviewer that there are unexplained gaps that you have to work real hard to hear the reason why... Chalkie White, A.

6656530,5,B00NH0MC4W,"Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson is back as the HBO gangster series, ""Boardwalk Empire,"" comes to its bloody end. The three-disc set of the fifth season is a blessing for those of us who want to binge watch our favorite TV show commercial free.
There are eight episodes through which runs two narratives: First, Prohibition is coming to an end, and Atlantic City gangster Nucky Thompson, roughly based on the historical bootlegger Enoch Johnson, needs to get a legitimate source of booze. Second, how did Nucky go from the being the ambitious son of a poor Irish-American fisherman to a killer in control of a criminal empire.
It is the weaving greed and hope that writer Terence Winter and director Tim Van Patten use to create their fascinating re-creation of Prohibition America. It is the greed of the easy quick-buck and the hope that the end won't come with a bullet.
In this final season, we finally learn about young Enoch and his first wife; how he met Gillian (played as an adult by Gretchen Mol) and became sheriff; and what fate befalls him as he sets about trying to make things right with his family. Along the way, we find out how Chalky White's (Michael Kenneth Williams) and Dr. Narcisse's (Jeffrey Wright) stories collide in bloody fashion and the end of federal agent-turned Chicago mobster Nelson Van Alden/George Mueller (Michael Shannon).
After asomewhat disappointing Season 4, it is great again to see stellar performances from Steve Buscemi as Nucky and Kelly MacDonald as Margaret.  As in earlier seasons, Buscemi and MacDonald are supported by great performances from Prohibition's bad boys Al Capone (Stephen Graham), Meyer Lansky (Anatol Yusef), Johnny Torrio (Greg Antonacci) and Lucky Luciano (Vincent Piazza). This season we even get to meet Bugsy Siegel (Michael Zegen) and a young man-on-the-make, Joe Kennedy (Matt Letscher).
With its completion, it is fair to say that while ""Boardwalk Empire"" was not as groundbreaking as Winter's ""The Sopranos,"" it was, at its best, the top show on television.",1422489600,,2022,5.035820895522388

6656535,4,B00NH0MC4W,this was a solid final season to the show. However the ending of the show was far less than it could have been. the real nucky went to jail.  that's a fine ending and far better than what we have here.  The show had to jump seven years into the future and that didn't help either.  rothstien's been murdered and we don't know why.  He was murdered by mobsters of course. The show features Nucky siding with maranza the leading mobster in America.  In reality mazanara wanted to be boss of bosses and was rubbed out by lucky Luciano who then formed the commission. Whatever the case this is still a great show. It was one of the better shows on tv during it's run.  If only it had lasted much longer.  The blu ray looks far better than the dvd and that's the way to go if you want to watch this one.,1422144000,,798,4.142857142857143

The season picked up several years later than the previous one, and for me there was too much of a discontinuity.  Also the flashbacks did not work for me, adding little to the character development and motivation.  This was particularly irritating given the rushed feeling much of the series denouement had.  I feel the time spent on the flashbacks slowed the momentum towards the finale.  Ultimately I take issue with the writers choices regarding the fate of the major characters.

6656552,3,B00NH0MC4W,"Loose ends and a bit of a disappointment. I bought this last Season and seriously had to go back and compare Season 4 and Season 5. How did Chalky get in prison? What made him lose his edge and let some crazy fellow prisoner tell him what to do and then give in to Narcisse instead of just cracking him and taking Daughter Maitland to a happier, saner life? What happened to his family? If they had taken all the flashbacks out (Nucky seeing how his mom was mistreated - sad, but not part of the story, holdup with his dad, chitchatting with his ex while they slow danced, Gillian giving her dresses to a prison guard while they talked, etc.) we could have had a bit more satisfaction about some very important characters, that just got blown away. Poor Allen - Blam! Poor Giggle-faced Mickey - Blam! Narcisse deserved more than holding and sliding down a wrought iron fence dying...no excitement; instead of a showdown, poor Chalky went out with a whimper..well let's just bring out the broom and start sweeping. His wife had a miscarriage and blip! - curtains for her with no reason.

I think Gillian was a horrible woman, forced into her lifestyle but as a mentor for women of domestic violence, I have seen horrible cases and complete turnarounds to help others. I think she was well of enough to come out of the asylum and do some time, then go to a halfway house.

And the way Nucky died, oh I am just heartstruck - I read up on the history and when I saw the ending, I just sat here shaking my head, ""No, no, no..Maaa-an?"" Another sweep of the broom...it didn't have to be so neat and tidy and corpses lined up for burial. Yes, I understand about ""you reap what you sow"", but I just think they could have done better and filled many of the holes we as dedicated BE fans were looking for.

6656615,5,B00NH0MC4W,"The final 8 episodes of Boardwalk Empire are definitely worth watching.  The show is historical fiction - although it has many characters that are historical figures, they do not let history get in the way of telling a good story.  Nucky Thompson is a composite character based primarily on the real Atlantic City Boss Nucky Hopkins.  Throughout the five seasons we see both the human and ruthless sides of the mobsters - Lucky Luciano, Myer Lansky, Al Capone, Nucky Thompson and others.  They all claim to wanting to just get ahead and build something for the future, but is that really all they want?  These ""bad"" men's legacy is suffering and pain, and with few exceptions they meet justice in the end.  I especially liked the Chalky White story arc - often the story line with Atlantic City's negro community and New York's Harlem fascinated me the most.  But Season 5 primarily goes back and forth between Nucky's ""present"" and his past - you see his childhood, his abusive family life, his fight to ""get ahead"", his introduction to nice things, his finding love, his true desire to do good, but also his eventual seduction and ruin.  In the end though, it is these ""beginnings"" that bring about the ending.  Cries for justice, when silenced, often end in shouts for revenge.  I don't know if Nucky's story concludes with justice done, but they certainly were the consequence of un-righted sins.  A very moral tale.",1418083200,,1420,4.778688524590164

6656625,5,B00NH0MC4W,"I have been watching Boardwalk Empire since the series began. This is just a great story, told by an amazing writing/directing team, with top notch actors.

Sadly this is the last season and a somewhat short one at that. Eight instead of the usual ten episodes. This season fast forwards into the future a bit over season four, but also offers some insights into Enuch and Eli and their childhood origins. Very interesting stuff.

The show is great but one criticism I will offer, I normally purchase the standard definition versions on Amazon Prime. They are both cheaper, and I have never yet noticed a single artifact that made it obvious that there was a difference. Not so with this one. If I had it to do over again, I would buy the HD version. There are many noticeable and obvious artifacts in the SD version. I cannot tell you if this is HBO's fault or if it is Amazon's, and I should also say most people won't notice, but I did.

One positive I will give HBO here. I love several of their series, but it is often very difficult to purchase an HBO show in a timely manner. I still had to wait until the season was over, but the whole season was released just a few days after the season ended. I would still prefer to get these weekly as the show is played, but the current situation is much better than waiting a full year which has been the prior pattern.

It is a little baffling that HBO and so many other companies have been so slow to recognize that people will purchase their shows with real money instead of pirating them if they are just given the opportunity to be honest. So this is an improvement.",1417824000,4,1619,4.368770764119601

6656629,2,B00NH0MC4W,"I didn't get this. I had enjoyed the previous 4 seasons, but after watching ""Golden Days"" I didn't understand what had happened between the end of season 4 and this episode, or how this continued the story. I then watched ""Golden Days"" a second time, and felt the same way. Then, since it had been some time since I had seen the last episode of Season 4, I decided to watch that episode again. Didn't help: I still don't know what the writers were trying to do with Season 5, Episode 1. There were so many interesting stories left unfinished at the end of Season 4, and they mostly disappeared with the new season, or it was unclear what had happened in the interim.

Don't get me wrong: the production values, cinematography, and acting were all up to the standards of the previous seasons. But not the writing: if the series started with this episode, I wouldn't continue with it.",1417564800,2,882,4.5125

We bought all the seasons on Amazon Prime (except the first, which was free to Prime members) and marathon watched them consecutively... We couldn't stop!  When we had watched up to the 5th and final season, we had to preorder it.  It became available December 1, and we started watching as soon as possible.  It didn't disappoint!  I have to say, a lot of unexpected things happened in this season, and the finale disappointed me tremendously, but overall, the show is great.  I don't know if you'll ever like criminals as much as you'll like Nookie, Al Capone (most of the time, anyway, though he's a psycho), Arnold Rothstein, and other infamous criminal figures in history.

6656632,5,B00NH0MC4W,"I, for one, have been on this series since I subscribed to it via HBO via my ISP. I am on the late fringe of that era and locality, and my Cousin's Father was suspiciously involved with those peeps and with the shenanigans. I well remember AC way back when and the local people remnants from  that era. HBO's director did, what I thought, was a very good film presentation for today's modern film psyche. I would equate it to the WIRE, ROME, DEADWOOD and the TREME presentations along with JUSTIFIED, LONGMIRE and presentations along those lines. Kudos to all professions involved in the filming. I'd give it a 5!",1416268800,,613,4.572727272727272
6656633,5,B00NH0MC4W,"Even though this is a truncated season of Boardwalk Empire (only 8 episodes), it managed to provide great sendoffs to all the major characters left on the show. The structure of this season is a bit atypical as it takes a page from Godfather II with a past storyline (the rise of Nucky Thompson) being told alongside the present storyline (the fall of Nucky Thompson)throughout the entire season. And this works very well as it helps to reinforce the major theme of this season:no matter how hard you try, you can't escape your past.  One of the reasons why I love this series is that it does a very good job unifying each season with a distinct theme that affects all the major storylines and character arcs. In this final season, all the major characters are forced to confront their past (the choices they made and the sins they committed)in some way.  Some of them come to terms with their past, most end up paying for their sins in powerful and unique ways. It's a bittersweet and uncompromising final season but very fitting and satisfying.",1416182400,61,1046,4.648648648648648
6656634,2,B00NH0MC4W,"Finally, someone was able to express my great disappoint, and ever greater disdain for the final season of Board Walk Empire. I have to be in total agreement to the excellent review posted by maskirovka (if you're a fan of the show, I highly recommend you read this review).

This final season was abound with rushed writing, unresolved character plots, and arbitrary flashbacks. Due to HBO forcing the writers to essentially ""wrap it up"" in the fifth installment, characters that audience members have endured for countless seasons are suddenly (and haphazrdly I might add) book ended in the most amateur of ways. Those aforementioned though, fair better than the poor characters that don't even get a proper ending, essentially just walking off the screen and off the show, leaving the viewer to postulate what their ultimate fate my have been. One gets the sense that the producers and writers were probably plotting the show out to span six or seven seasons before HBO decided to pull the plug, leaving large gaping plot holes in their wake. If your an avid viewer, I do recommend you watch it for finality, but please do prepare to be left in a fit of  bewilderment and anger.",1416096000,2,1181,4.812807881773399
6656635,4,B00NH0MC4W,Good entertainment. Certainly not a morality lesson.,1415836800,,52,6.571428571428571
6656636,3,B00NH0MC4W,"The series didn't quite go out with the ""big bang"" of quality described by the critics that previewed it; but as far as I'm concerned, in terms of quality in general, the fifth season was pretty much back up to the level of the first two seasons. But let's please keep in mind that, with the exception of large portions of the second season, this series was fairly much, for the most part, three-stars-out-of-five in quality.

To rehash a bit, the third season wouldn't have been much without the excellent Bobby Cannavale, who played the character of Gyp Rosetti. (Despite being the darkhorse in his field, Cannavale won the Emmy Award for his performance. Let's face it, he carried the season.) As for the fourth season, it was a total snore. God Almighty, I can't even remember what it was about.

This leads us to the fifth and final season. It was a shock to find out that the entire season was to be comprised of only eight episodes. What a rip. I expected lots of the major characters to get knocked off, and many met their deserved bloody demise, which was fine. As for Nucky, he ended up flipping over and playing dead at, what seemed to be, the drop of a hat (and this was completely out of character, of course). I won't get into the details, because I don't want to spoil things, but you'll know exactly what I mean by the time you reach the last couple of episodes.

Overall, a decent final season that nevertheless lacked a sharp edge and, for the most part, was just too damn predictable so much of the time.",1415750400,,1523,4.451612903225806

6656638,4,B00NH0MC4W,"There will be spoilers.

Absolutely loved this season.  But with only eight episodes to tie everything up, it wasn't going to be an easy feat.  But, they made it work, for the most part.

The flashbacks were absolutely great,  and a massive defining moment of the series and characters.  From Nucky's fateful decision to become sheriff to completely write the future for himself and many close to him.  It was mentioned in some detail on what transformed Gillian into the Gillian we came to know in the past.  But we get to see how it really affects Nucky and Gillian, along with her family.

The series half delivers an ironic, and poetic ending.  It made sense, but it ultimately felt rushed.  How did he know?  Did Gillian write him letters too?  Revenge and justice seems perfectly logical for Nucky to meet his fate.  But,  I just wish they could've fleshed it out a little more.

I can't really blame the writers though.  With only eight episodes to tie everything up, and only an hour episode to close it off?  It should've been more.  20 more minutes could have been a blessing.  But in their case, they didn't go past an hour.

So many things we missed because of the jump to 1931.  The death of Rothstein.  The maiming of Lucky.  So many unanswered questions after such a leap in history.  Jumping forward seven years without an explanation of how these characters ended where they were.

Great final season.  It could've used more time though.",1414886400,2,1454,4.622047244094488
6656639,5,B00NH0MC4W,"I loved this season most of all. It was more human and psychologically realistic, and contained far less Hollywood-shoot-em-up BS than previous seasons. I did wonder why Chalky was killed off, and Daughter Maitland sold out her musical style. It was dramatically interesting, but felt false, because those two characters had given no indication in previous seasons that they would be capable of being so broken by their circumstances. I would've liked to have seen a happier ending for those two; but I know, life isn't like that.

I loved the way Nucky died most of all and am very surprised to hear others criticize it. Then again, I'm a believer in karma, and the way he died looks like an obvious implication that his karma--for the worst crimes he ever committed, got him in the end. He aided and abetted the rape of a child, and then murdered that child's future son, and her grandson--who was connected to both of those victims--is the one who gets Nucky in the end. Brilliant! And I am so pleased that the series didn't end in some horrible, cheesy Hollywoodified shoot out with gangsters, which is what viewers were probably expecting. It ended with such an elegant, understated and surprising reveal about the kid's true identity. And Nucky dies by a single shot to the head, such a tiny bullet, after all the dangers he had faced in his life. I thought it was absolutely brilliant, totally fitting, and I AM SO GLAD NUCKY DIDN'T GO OUT IN SOME HUGE, CHEESY, BULLETS FLYING HOLLYWOOD GANGSTER SHOOT OUT SCENE, WHICH WOULD'VE BEEN CORNY, PREDICTABLE AND MEANINGLESS. Huge congratulations to the writers and the director for making narrative choices that were classy, understated, and realistic, instead of taking the cheap, cheesy way out. I was very impressed and pleased, and was totally surprised by the kid's real identity. I hadn't suspected anything up until that last moment. Wonderful!",1414800000,3,1902,4.8885448916408665
