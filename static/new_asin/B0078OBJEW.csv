8512325,3,B0078OBJEW,finally a work out designed for riders!  Great exercise program that helps with core stability during your ride.  I love the program but do have a few gripes.  As a workout queen from the 90's I still have some of those old step DVD's and love them.  That being said it makes me crazy that it does not tell you what equipment is needed for each segment and be sure to keep the remote handy as it basically 'shows' you the moves and then you are on your own for completion of the exercise...  So to accommodate for that I have made up a cheat sheet to use and really only refer to the video when I fall off the workout wagon and need a refresher.  Maybe the could include the sheet in the DVD for future buyers?  They do have an online membership as well and will design you a program,1410220800,4,783,4.1118421052631575
8512326,3,B0078OBJEW,"I'm a personal trainer who rides and competes in Hunter/Jumpers so I am always looking for new ways to workout and improve my fitness for riding. I think that this DVD could be good for beginners who haven't worked out much because the exercises were pretty basic and explained well. I didn't find anything innovative here. The DVD shows you the exercise and then you have to pause it to complete the recommended number of sets/reps. While I can appreciate that they don't want to waste a lot of time on each exercise, I would find this a bit annoying to pause every time, especially with equipment in hand. I honestly didn't get through the whole DVD when I realized I wouldn't get much out of it as an experienced exerciser. Some exercise equipment is necessary.",1402012800,3,764,4.625
8512327,1,B0078OBJEW,I am a fitness trainer and competitor.  Thought I would get some new ideas but was not impressed with the content or presentation.  Very easy to understand though and very basic.,1401580800,,178,4.709677419354839
8512328,5,B0078OBJEW,I just received this DVD so am only into the program about a week but I'm quite pleased with it so far.  The exercises are simple and doable yet I'm surprised at how challenging they are as a group.  I'm hoping the focus on improving my horseback riding will help keep me on track.  I find the equestrian focus a lot more interesting than the other exercise videos I have tried.,1371686400,3,378,4.295774647887324
