8655383,5,B00K2OBYLI,"I never thought I would see Caddie ever appear on DVD. My old VHS tape wore out years ago. It was one of the breakthrough films of the Australian film industry, but I thought it would end up a forgotten film. Thanks to actress Jacki Weaver's emergence as a top actress, we are now seeing this fine film emerge. I didn't even realize it has been for sale on Amazon for a few years and snapped it up. It was also another early film of Jack Thompson who ran away with the film with his dashing portrayal of one of Caddie's suitors.",1529193600,,528,4.186274509803922
8655384,4,B00K2OBYLI,"After a long career, Australian actress Jacki Weaver in her late sixties earned an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress for Animal Kingdom (Australia, 2010), and then repeated with another Supporting Actress nomination for Silver Linings Playbook (United States, 2012). Those nominations may have been what prompted the release of this DVD, in U.S. (NTSC) format, in 2014. A number of Australian movies have been only available in non-U.S. format, requiring a region-free DVD player, or they were released only on VHS (U.S. format) but never on DVD. So this DVD, with two of Weaver's earlier Australian films, is very welcome. But there's more!! Caddie (Australia, 1976) also features esteemed Australian actress Helen Morse, better known in the U.S. for her lead role in the 1981 TV miniseries A Town Like Alice (eventually combined as a quasi-movie but only released on VHS...grr!!).  Morse, for Caddie, won the 1976 Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Actress, while Weaver, for the same movie the same year, won the AFI award for Best Supporting Actress. Additionally, Caddie earned a 1976 AFI nomination (it didn't win the award) for Best Picture, but in the U.S. the movie only came out originally on VHS, and the VHS went out of print and over the years became semi-rare, to boot. So having Caddie the movie, the performances in it by Morse and Weaver, and then the other movie as a Weaver bonus, produces a multiple treat. I immediately ordered the two-movie DVD when I rather accidentally found out about it. The visual quality on the DVD (the Caddie half I watched) is very good. I don't see that there's an English subtitles option, but, unless one is hard of hearing, Australian accents are never inordinately difficult for Americans to follow.",1511136000,,1770,5.020408163265306
