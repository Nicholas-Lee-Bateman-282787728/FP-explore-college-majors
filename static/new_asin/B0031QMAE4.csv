8648223,1,B0031QMAE4,"This DVD is definitely for beginners.  It said that the run time was 60 minutes.  I didn't time in or watch it again to time it, but it was maybe 30-40 minutes long, at the most.  The information in the DVD kinda makes me leery of purchasing the Advanced DVD.",1264723200,8,259,4.14
