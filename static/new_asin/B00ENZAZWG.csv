I still don't see why others have such bad viewing with these discs.  As with the second in the series, ""Mysterious Worlds Underwater"", I found that the picture was, for the most part, sharp with bright colors and GREAT 3d depth.  Some OOS effects reached maybe 50-60%.  Yes, there were a couple of dark shots in the movie, but it was in a cave or sunken ship.  It might have been what the director wanted.  Still looked good to me.

Of course, it does help to have your equipment set-up properly and calibration of audio and video is also important.

I definitely recommend this or any in the series to those that like this kind of documentary and/or 3D.

PS:  In the description, the running time is listed as 106 minutes, but the one I received was half that at 53 minutes.  It is still good.",1430956800,,816,4.402684563758389
8607169,1,B00ENZAZWG,This film was very disappointing.  The colors were mostly a pale bluish green of not very beautiful fish.  It didn't show a lot of colorful fish. I would advise anyone to read the reviews before spending anymore money on these 3d nature vdeo's,1429488000,,243,4.627906976744186

8607173,1,B00ENZAZWG,"It's an okay underwater film. Apparently, the editor forgot to color correct it. The whole film is so GREEN and this 3D give me a headache. Terrible!!!! No color correction post production or enough lights while filming. If I can give it a 0, I would but one star will do.",1393286400,4,272,4.352941176470588
8607174,4,B00ENZAZWG,"I was hoping that there would be more hunting action in this video, but there was virtually none. It mainly followed fish around with a good narrative of how the fish hunt.",1392854400,3,172,4.40625
