6300174,1,B00IVLRA4O,I agree with the reviewer who said it was almost (but not quite) bad enough to be funny.,1406419200,2,88,3.9444444444444446
6300175,1,B00IVLRA4O,"This movie reads like a bad Chinese propaganda film aimed at making children follow rules.

My kids are watching it right now.

It is horrible.

Almost bad enough to be funny, but not really.",1406246400,10,191,4.5588235294117645

6300177,3,B00IVLRA4O,"First thing first, this movie suffers from really lazy script writing. For example, the audience is told that Long Tail is looking for a ""artifact"" without the any further explanation, and then we're told the artifact is ""the guardian amulet"". Names for characters are already known to Long Tail without anyone mentioning it to him before hand. It seems like some the movie was highly edited with scenes being dropped  but the writer(s) never redid the script.

The movie also suffers from poor animation. Some scenes are even used over and over again. However, there were a few beautiful shots through out the movie.

Yet, this movie does have a charm to it. I know it shouldn't since the pacing was slow, with many scenes placed in the movie just to pad time, but the movie was entertaining, so it at least got something right.

I wouldn't own this movie, but if your children want to watch something to keep them entertained for a hour and a half, you can't go wrong with this movie.",1404259200,8,986,4.617142857142857
6300178,1,B00IVLRA4O,"My daughter loves foxes. When I spotted this movie I thought she might like it but I think she was as confused by it as I was. First off, the animation is absolutely horrible. The character designs are cute but such bad animation. Now on to the voice work. Uh, what the heck is going on with this movie? The plot is crazy flimsy anyway but the voices don't quite match up with the poorly animated mouths of the animals. It's like watching a dubbed Godzilla movie. Hey wait a minute. That's what's wrong with this thing, it was clearly made for another country then dubbed in English. Not always a bad thing but in this case, wow. What a stinker. My daughter loves foxes. She does not love this movie.",1404000000,,700,4.351145038167939

This isn't exactly a movie to be professionally critiquing this is more of just... entertainment. it has choppy cgi and the english acting is overdone. Its definitly something to watch with the kids though. If ur an adult by yourself though, it might be boring for you. unless you just like foxes in general.

6300185,5,B00IVLRA4O,"Agent F.O.X. is an adorable Chinese animated film. It's such a sweet movie with cute morals.

In the film, a cute fox agent is trying to get a treasure from a town of rabbits, but to do so, he must join them and befriend them. But as the film goes on, Agent Fox becomes very close with the sweet rabbits, and Fox finds it harder and harder to do the bad things that he's ordered to do by his boss. Fox later begins to hate his boss, and he must choose whether he stays with the rabbits, or do what his boss tells him.

This movie is filled with so many lovable characters. I love all the characters, but my favorites are Agent Fox, Princess, and the lovable bully rabbit named Buggy who tries way too hard to act tough. He's actually really sweet and silly.

I watched the English version of this movie, and I loved every minute of it. This is an adorable, sweet, and lighthearted little adventure movie, and it deserves more love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.",1457049600,,972,4.300546448087432

6300187,4,B00IVLRA4O,"A fox who is a failure to his own kind, finds he is a hero to the Rabbits.
The same rabbits he is sent to rob of their secret artifact.

He is surprised to learn they don't act like enemies, instead they are kind to him and love him. He didn't expect that partly because he is used to being treated poorly, apparently even by his own kind. Being touched deeply he decides to help them instead of hurt them. They win his heart and he learns to love them like family.

Slightly underrated film that's a breath of life and love, made by people with kind and loving souls. The reason it didn't do so hot is apparent though. The dialog is very odd- likely a poor translation effort from the native Chinese it was originally created in. The animation work is fun, but also no up to AAA standards. There is poor choices made in editing, and reused animation sequences *especially for the fox opening his communicator with the commander"".

It's no disney\pixar film- plenty of strange flaws here.
 If you can get past your cynical side that prevents you from enjoying a very rough cut amateur small team kind of film, then maybe, just maybe you can learn to love this film as I have. Cutest fox character ever in a film? probably.

Thank you to the people who made this film. You are wonderful people. Ignore the haters and keep doing what you believe in! It's good stuff.",1453420800,,1364,4.396825396825397

6300194,2,B00IVLRA4O,"I took this movie out from the library.  I would not pay $20 for the dvd.  The movie clocks in at 83 minutes with no extras.  Although stylized in a few areas the animation is on par or less than what Disney is putting out on Disney Junior.  Agent Fox felt like a poor man's version of Disney's Special Agent Oso with a little Kung Fu Panda moral lesson thrown in.  The movie did not hold the attention of my 4 and 6 year old boys.  Glad I didn't spend money on this.  For the $20.68 price (on 9/20/2014) you would be better off buying a few Special Agent Oso dvds - longer run time, better animation, tighter stories and same moral lessons.",1411171200,4,641,4.162601626016261
6300195,3,B00IVLRA4O,"Just saw the movie on my Xbox One Netflix app. The movie of the fox and his rabbit friends was ok/mediocre (not bad nor good to be precise) in my opinion although I felt it could have been done better. Would somewhat recommend it for kids right out of the box.

6300197,1,B00IVLRA4O,"Bad animation and scripting.  Ultimately pointless plot, or at least a cringe - inducing surprise ending. You would think, even if no one else, the fox would zero in even in a passing glance on the word 'fox'.  Also the book of species. Is it purposely miswriten to protect the fox, or is every creature labeled as a version of rabbit?  Of the two movies I've seen by Kablam, both looked like they were put together by a team of animation school rejects.",1407888000,4,454,4.445783132530121

8645674,3,B00IVLRA4O,"At a glance Agent FOX bears a striking resemblance to Disneys blockbuster Zootopia.  We have a city full of anthropomorphic animals, a case study on the tumultuous relationship between foxes and rabbits, we even have a possibly-corrupt government system driving the motivations of the lead characters.

However, thats where the similarities between the two films end.  While Zootopia brilliantly shrinks the world in which we live into a microcosm of accuracy and brilliance, Agent FOX takes the same initial elements and garbles them up into a collection of scenes held together by terrible acting and a senseless plot.

Of course, these harsh assessments apply to the direct-to-DVD English dub of the film; the original Chinese movie upon which its based may well be a masterpiece.

That said,  also known as The Firefox of Bunnington Burrows is a Chinese 3D computer animated fantasy adventure film directed by Ge Shuiying.  It was released theatrically on October 30, 2014 in both 2D and 3D.  On July 1st, 2014 Kaboom Entertainment released the DVD version being reviewed here domestically.  It comes in at a run-time of 83-minutes.

The story here tells of Agent FOX (Shannon Settlemyre) having been sent to Carrot Town via a hot air balloon shaped like a giant cat head (nothing high profile about this) to find a lost artifact, the guardian amulet.

Carrot Town, as you may have surmised, is a city full of rabbits.  When he's immediately found out, the residents confuse him for a long-tail rabbit cousin and he goes along with the tale, pretending to have lost his memory so that he can hang around and seek out the amulet.

As he lingers on in C-Town, he begins to learn lessons from the creatively named Elder (Anthony Yeager), becomes friends with equally craftily named Princess Bunny (Ashley Bril), and shares his invention skills with a spider professor named Professor Web.

Along the way the production team tries every trick in the book to make the piece somewhat endearing; from a strangely out of place emotional opening and closing narration (but whos doing the speaking, Im still not entirely sure), to an overacted vocal cast that manage to unintentionally remind the viewer constantly that voice acting is tougher than Pixar makes it look.

As is so often the case with dubbed foreign films, the visuals here are not to blame for the films shortcomings.  Everything is clean and well animated.  The character models aren't anything to write home about but they're easily identifiable and get the job done.  In fact they're about on pace with what DreamWorks was giving us back in 2006 with Over the Hedge.  Where things get ugly is the plot itself; namely the lack thereof.  Rather than come off as a focused narrative or a comedic adventure story, Agent FOX meanders around with a plot that is, at the same time, overly simplistic and complicated.

Whats actually happening is as simple as a story gets: The lead character is trying to find an object that hes been ordered to find among a misunderstood society.  What you think is happening is a lot more complex on account of a whole bunch of muddled elements like never revealing exactly what it is hes after, what it does, why it matters.

Worse still is FOX is ordered about by a faceless, top-hat sporting commander named Commander who, not unlike Dr. Claw from the old Inspector Gadget cartoons, is only seen on camera from the back of his chair in a control room.  Whats wrong with this, you wonder?  Well, nothing except that the character is so overacted and one-dimensional that any hope for genuine hero growth or realistic motivations because of his influence goes right out the window.

Kids may laugh at the abundant slapstick or tune in (temporarily) because of the cuteness of the characters but it doesnt take long for even the most nondiscriminatory among us to discover the painful pace of the plotting, the lack of story, the poor acting and the bland conclusion all equate to time better spent watching almost anything else instead.",1489017600,,4028,4.878120411160059
