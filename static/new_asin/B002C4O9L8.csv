8363127,1,B002C4O9L8,"I could not believe that the producer dared to release such a DVD as this one. It contains 3 true crimes. The last one is Marty Tankleff's case. In 1988, 17-year-old Marty Tankleff, confessed to police that he killed his parents. However, the DVD clearly showed the detective admitted he had told the teenager lies in order to trick him into confession. As a result, Marty was sent to life in prison.

The story went on and on. It's very interesting because I could not be sure if  the kid really killed his parents. He kept on insisting he was innocent while in prison. After 15 years, Marty's family hired private investigator Jay Salpeter to dig into the new evidence. They got some new ones. They also hired new lawyers. With these pieces of information, in 2004, they requested the judge to reconsider the case. In the DVD, the narrator was standing in front of the courthouse and said ""The judge is deliberating the new evidences of the case and will soon hand down his decision."" Yet,  the DVD ENDS RIGHT THERE! What on earth is the producer doing? The back of the DVD's cover stated it was released in 2008. That's 4 years after the judge's decision and it DOES NOT HAVE AN UPDATE of the CASE. It just ends without any conclusion as it should.

I searched on the Web and found two reliable websites that show photos of Marty, his family members, and the private investigator after he was released in 2006/2007.

I definitely feel cheated by the producer of this DVD. So, stay away from this and save your money.",1344556800,6,1519,4.529197080291971
