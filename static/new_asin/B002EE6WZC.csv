8367624,3,B002EE6WZC,"In this disc, the cars from Auto meet Billy, a jeep from the mountains.  He is dirty and speaks like he is half literate.  While he is aggressive in the first episode, by the last one he is bothered enough by fighting that he leaves the Town of Auto and returns to the peace of the mountains.  If I was from Appalacia, I would be somewhat offended, even if the stereotypes do not all persist until the end.  In my opinion, there are better discs of Auto B. Good.",1364083200,,462,4.157303370786517
8367625,2,B002EE6WZC,"While i can appreciate the rush to create something to replace veggie tales...doing a a Pixar Knock-Off poorly isn't the best way to do it.  I only briefly pre-screened this show before showing it to my 3 year old...glad i did.  Each episode seems to have too many goals...and the message isn't clear and direct.  For example, it seems to me that the episode ""Get out the Oomph""...is trying to teach about...steroids. Surely no child below the age of 12 needs to learn that you can a. temporarily boost your physical abilities by ingesting something or b. ingesting something that makes your body better will hurt you in the end.  That's why we have the Olympics and Major League Baseball. They could have taken their stories lots of useful places, but these cartoons really seem to be off the mark.  just because these are marketed as ""Christian productions""...doesn't mean the are high quality, should be viewed by your children without careful thought, or for that matter...purchased.",1332892800,,987,4.921686746987952
