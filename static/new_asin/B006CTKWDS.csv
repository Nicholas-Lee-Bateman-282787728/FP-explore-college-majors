During the interview he mentioned he had a special, and he seemed to have a particular type of humor that I find very easy and approachable.  I knew the show was going to be hilarious from the opening lines.

I especially liked the Motown dig; harsh but true.",1412726400,4,417,4.1875

4983788,5,B006CTKWDS,I heard it first on Pandora and decided to buy this because it was so funny.  I was having a pretty bad day and was listening to it on my bed while doing homework.  I found myself laughing out loud even though I was alone and it made me feel loads better.,1387324800,3,255,3.8846153846153846
4983789,4,B006CTKWDS,I first heard this very funny comedian on Pandora. I was so impressed with the snippets I decided to make this purchase. I was not let down. It was funny the whole way through without relying on the full repertoire of cuss words that most comics use. I prefer intelligent comedy .. and John Mulaney delivers.,1386201600,2,308,4.517857142857143

4983794,5,B006CTKWDS,"I have had this DVD for 2 or 3 weeks now, and I have watched it 2 or 3 times. This is a good example of why he is one of the funniest comedy writers out there today. He is a fantastic story teller, and has a great way of getting you involved with the story. I wish he had more videos. Now ... I can't say every skit was a home run, but there are 3 or 4 that just get me rolling each time I watch it. It is worth it.",1375056000,3,415,3.4731182795698925

4983797,5,B006CTKWDS,"I saw this stand up on ""Comedy Central Presents"" and laughed my a$$ off all night with my girlfriend, he looks so innocent yet comes up with hilariously racy jokes. I bought this for my GF's graduation present and she loved it! I can watch him over and over again.",1369958400,3,264,4.3
4983798,5,B006CTKWDS,I heard him on Pandora. He's really funny. Young and straight to the point jokes. It's like listening to a funny coworker who happens to have stories to tell.,1369699200,3,158,4.482758620689655
4983799,5,B006CTKWDS,Finally found this. Originally I was going to buy a hard copy but downloading is also nice. I can't wait to share with my loved ones.,1369353600,3,133,4.153846153846154
4983800,5,B006CTKWDS,"I've watched this three times, still hilarious. I remember watching Mulaney doing random VH1 snippets on those Sunday morning ""Celebrities are rich and crazy"" shows, he was always the most hilarious one. Glad he hasn't lost his touch and is getting the publicity he deserves!

Also if you liked this, check out his joke ""Best Meal I ever had""",1369267200,3,342,4.796610169491525

4983805,5,B006CTKWDS,So funny.  The xanax bit sealed the deal for me.  I am watching this one again now and will recommend John to my friends and family.  I'm a fan of great comedy and own a wide variety of stand ups from Bill Cosby to Louis CK.  I enjoyed New in Town as much as any of them.  I will probably gift this one as well.,1363219200,3,311,3.723076923076923

4983807,5,B006CTKWDS,This is one of the best stand up comedy performances...ever.  I can't think of a bad thing to write about it.  It's simply perfect.,1358035200,2,131,4.416666666666667
4983808,5,B006CTKWDS,"Best new, or at least new to me, comedian I have heard in many years.  His skits are well thought out, funny and told with a really enjoyable self deprecating style.  I watched this dvd with people ranging from 24 to 64.  All had tears in their eyes from laughing so hard.  I should mention, that he didn't once do a crotch joke, or make any lengthy references to gastrointestinal problems.  I'm not a prude and don't mind blue humor when its funny.  I think for too many comedians though, its become a crutch.  A default to return to if the jokes aren't getting over.  That's certainly not the case here.  I hope to see a lot more from this guy.  Great standup!",1356825600,2,662,4.308943089430894

Funny, but not in a overly crude way. (not that i have a problem with that)  He is a fantastic story teller
and his timing is terrific.  I have watched this special probably 6 times since i bought it and i always laugh.  A good buy.",1348531200,3,441,3.9213483146067416
4983817,5,B006CTKWDS,"John Mulaney is hilarious! The best thing about it is that he's not crude or inappropriate at any time throughout this set. He talks about life situations and makes fun of himself while giving up very personal information...""The Xanax Story""...I would and do recommend him to all who are looking for a good laugh.",1348099200,4,313,4.814814814814815

8496602,5,B006CTKWDS,"His sit-com fell on deaf ears, but it's  only because people didn't  get the macro joke. Make no mistake, this is one of the best stand up comics and comedy writers since Bob Newhart. He is in the very top tier of stand up comedy today. Tony Hitchcliff, Norm Macdonald, Todd Barry, Jerry Seinfeld, Gilbert Gotfried, Jim Gaffigan. And John Mulaney is right there with them, and better than several. Miss George Carlin? Then give Mulaney a shot. I give John Mulaney's New in Town a rating of....ALL The Stars.",1462406400,6,507,4.622222222222222
