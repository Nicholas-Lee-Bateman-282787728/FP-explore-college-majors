This disc, reviewed here as a Blu-ray, contains recordings dating from 2012 and 2014. The earlier recording features the Beethoven concerto and the later recording features the Mendelssohn concerto. In each case there is an encore  the Sarabande movement from Bachs unaccompanied Partitas for violin 1 and 2 respectively. Despite the slight discrepancy in recording dates the two recordings are completely well matched and faithful in all sound considerations (presented in both HD Master DTS 5.1 and Master PCM stereo). Visuals are crisp and offer an involving visual experience without being invasive or fragmentary. The HD recordings are of the usual high quality that one has come to expect from the Paul Smaczny team.

The soloist, Nikolaj Znaider, has achieved an enviable reputation over the preceding years and is now considered to be one of the most sought-after soloists. On this occasion he delivers performances of all four works with consummate skill and insight which should give much satisfaction to purchasers. The two Bach Sarabandes make suitably satisfying encores and are much appreciated by the audiences on both occasions. There is much to enjoy and appreciate about the performances in total and nothing that would cause doubt as to the attraction of the disc as a purchase option. It is unlikely that it will be seriously challenged on either performance or interpretive grounds other than by discs offering alternative couplings or presenting period performances on period instruments.

The booklet emphasises the lively tempos adopted by Znaider and Chailly in the two concertos. While this is certainly true of the Mendelssohn, whose final movement is played at the limit of feasibility for the accompanying woodwind players, and also the cheerful finale of the Beethoven, the same cannot in all honesty be applied to the opening two movements of the Beethoven.  These need not be a matter of concern though as the style is correct. Whereas Mutter in her performance with Ozawa and the BPO adopts an approach that could be loosely described as steady early Romantic era Znaider and Chailly adopt an approach to these two movements more in line with steady central Classical era. Isabelle Faust adopts similar tempi throughout in her 2015 account with Haitink and the BPO whose coupling is Beethoven's Symphony 6.

To support this impression, the performance times might be worth considering. Whereas Znaider takes 23.51 and 8.56 for the first two movements, Mutter takes 27.29 and 11.02. This is a considerable difference and this changes the stylistic nature of the two performances in the manner as suggested. However, in terms of actual liveliness, there is no-one to compare with Heifetz, now available on superb re-mastered SACD, linking the same two concertos. He nips through the Beethoven in 37.49 complete and the Mendelssohn in 24.01 and all without any sense of hurry!

There are a number of interesting details that link the two concertos, the soloist and the violin to Leipzig and which are described in some detail in the supplied notes. Znaider himself has played at Leipzig with this orchestra and Chailly often enough for a real sense of partnership to have developed.  Mendelssohn was inspired by the Beethoven concerto, which he also conducted a number of times, to write his own violin concerto. It was dedicated to his friend Ferdinand David who was the Concert Master of the Leipzig orchestra and who gave the first performance.

The 1741 del Gesu Guarneri violin Znaider plays is on permanent loan from the Royal Danish Theatre supported by both the Velux Foundation and the Knud Hejgaard Foundation and is the once owned and used by Kreisler. It is therefore also known as the Kreisler del Gesu violin. The link between Kreisler, the violin and Leipzig is that Kreisler played the Beethoven concerto in 1907 with the orchestra. He also used his own cadenzas instead of the more familiar Joachim cadenzas and it is the Kreisler cadenzas that are used in this performance by Znaider.

In summary this disc can be welcomed as offering a satisfying combination of core repertoire in equally satisfying performances.",1481155200,3,4191,5.140969162995595
8745516,5,B019MX8GK6,"We all know the Beethoven and the Mendelssohn, but this is a superior recording with the advantage of watching and listening to the soloist, ensemble, and the conductor...as well as excellent camera work along with DTS-MA (5.1) sound.
Nikolaj Znaider and Riccardo Chailly are completely in sync with one another and Maestrro Chailly LEADS his forces in a totally cohesive performance...particularly in the Beethoven.

Attacks, releases, dynamics, intonation, and balance are completely supportive of Mr. Znaider and everyone feels and knows that this not merely a performance of old warhorses, but instead an event of tremendous satisfaction by all involved...including the listener or observer.  I have never heard a more wonderful combination of every thing required to make room on your favorites shelf for one of the absolute best recordings...ever.

The Mendelssohn is nearly as well performed by the soloist and ensemble.  The exquisite Beethoven is hard to match, but nonetheless, again, completely satisfying.

The two Sarabandes from Violin Partitas BMV 1004 & BMV 1004 are superb.  Again Mr. Znaider offers performances of gorgeous beauty and intelligent comprehension of the music.

What makes this recording so special is the accompanying orchestral involvement and the immersion of the Gewandhaus Orchestra, Leipzig together with Riccardo Chailly to offer musicianship seldom seen or heard.

Buy this one; it's a keeper!",1473292800,8,1433,5.571428571428571
8745517,5,B019MX8GK6,"At last!  If you're tired of endless Mahler and Bruckner bombast, concertos do exist.  Accentus Music decided to do a concert recording of the
two greatest violin concertos with the Leipzig, the Orchestra that premiered the Mendelssohn concerto in 1845. In quality, this ranks with
Buchbinder's Beethoven piano concertos, high praise for me (wish they would do a disc with the Tchiakovsky and Bruch concertos, hint hint.)
The sound AND the video are state of the art, and the performances are great  The sound is so good that the slightly darker sound of the
Leipzig first violins comes through. Also included are two Bach Partitas by Znaider. You can't go wrong.

The menu is just like a regular DVD, without having to go through a bunch of submenus, and unlike most other concert recordings, DTS
surround is the default audio. One caveat: on my disc PCM stereo has no sound, so if this important to you, be forewarned.  Headphone sound
through my receiver is fine. All in all, an outstanding musical and technical choice.",1469059200,10,1023,4.85632183908046
