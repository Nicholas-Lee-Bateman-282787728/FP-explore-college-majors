8204394,5,B000S6LS7U,"""Strawberry Roan"" is another one of my favorite Gene Aurty movies.  I love that it is in color.  Wish he had been able to do more color movies, but I love all his movies.  He was a really good guy!  I like all the extras on the DVDs also.  I had never seen the Melody Ranch shows before.
