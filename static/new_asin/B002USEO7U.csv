8381487,5,B002USEO7U,"This is contemporary Brazilian samba at its best, a delightful program by really fine musicians. There are 23 songs, and the last one is Canto De Ossanha, a memorable performance that captures the beauty and emotion of this legendary Afro-Samba song by Baden Powell and Vinicius de Moraes. I'm American, but I played this DVD for a Brazilian friend and she sang, danced, loved it, borrowed it to play for her Brazilian friends, so you know it is the real thing. Fine vocals, first-rate mandolin and percussion, etc. It's a stage show with a young audience that loves this more traditional Brazilian music. If you are seriously into musica brasileira, this DVD is for you.",1400630400,,671,4.843478260869565
