I read it together with my 8 year old daughter, as it was one of my favorite book as a child and I was so excited to see that they made a movie, we wanted so bad to watch it and it was the biggest disappointment. A lot of times the movies are a bit different than the book, but what they did here was just wrong. It started pretty good and it ended up a mess. The book was way better. If I knew this I would not have purchased it...
The DVD- s came in good condition and I have no complaints about my order, its just not a good rendition of the book.",1518048000,,600,3.732283464566929
