I still enjoyed the shows yet I had forgotten or not noticed how much Lassie wimpered throughout, it was a bit annoying, lol. Someone else commented on how Timmy always reminded them of a Precious Moments figurine and lol it is so true.  I thought I was the only one who thought that.  Still great.  I would recommend to those who have kids and who love their pets.  Enjoy!",1318204800,13,547,4.635416666666667
2385522,5,B000ADKVI8,"Thank you for a nice nostalgic trip back in time!
The Lassie TV-series with little Timmy (Jon Provost) were fantastic - so many childhood memories even for me living outside the U.S.!
Sunday afternoons in Sweden during the early '60s were dedicated for the Lassie show!
At least for me and my buddies!
Thanks again for reviving those fond moments!

Christer Lindstrom in Sweden!
