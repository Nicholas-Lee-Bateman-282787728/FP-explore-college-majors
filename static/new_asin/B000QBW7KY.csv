2835096,4,B000QBW7KY,"The Life and Significance of G.I. Gurdjieff - Gurdjieff in Egypt:

I have been studying Egyptian culture for many years. It is fascinating to me that this ancient civilization has left its mark on the world and the remaining treasures of contemporary monuments and artifacts.

I had purchased the VHS version of ""Gurdjieff in Egypt"" when it first came out as a matter of course - anything Egyptian. I was a little disappointed in the technical quality in the beginning, but found the story to be amazing!

When I saw the re-issue on DVD, I knew I had to get it. I'm glad I did because the quality is much better. Many improvements have been made to the original.  The maps have been re-done with enhanced techniques that show the movements and locations being described, the live footage looks better and many of the graphics have been improved.

Because I found the story of Gurdjieff's search so interesting, I have also purchased the other two DVDs in this trilogy and can't wait to see them!

2835097,5,B000QBW7KY,"For those who have knowledge of and interest in Gurdjieff and his teaching, the Fourth Way, I would highly recommend the trilogy of DVD's, collectively titled The Life and Significance of George Ivanovich Gurdjieff.  Patterson and his colleagues have managed to capture both flavor and substance in this important presentation and have contributed a unique addition to the body of works related to Gurdjieff and the Fourth Way.

I found the first DVD Gurdjieff in Egypt to be particularly interesting and revealing.  The source of the teaching Gurdjieff brought to the West has always been a subject of both interest and dispute.  Many have sought to claim it for their own, from Sufism to the Orthodox Church. It is surprising that in doing so they ignore the little that Gurdjieff did state about the origins of the teaching; that its source was Egypt, not the Egypt we know but the one we do not know, pre sand Egypt.  Patterson in a detailed and cogent manner presents the case for pre sand Egypt, always being careful to note where his opinions begin and the written, historical record ends. The ancient Egyptian religion is entered into and related to the Gurdjieff work in a very seamless manner. The DVD also presents some stunning visual impressions of the ancient temples and monuments of Egypt as well as a fair amount of the flavor of modern Egypt.",1191024000,8,1360,4.819742489270387

Mr. Patterson tells the story in a way that keeps the viewer captivated and at the same time so much information is being said that you need to watch it many times to receive a fraction of what is being given.

In Gurdjieff's early search for esoteric knowledge, he uncovered an ancient map of this prehistoric Egypt.  This early Egypt was Christian many thousands of years before Christ, and long before what was previously considered the beginnings of Egyptian civilization.

The quality of the production is high and the video received a significant award at the Houston International Film Festival. It has recently been issued in DVD format with some revisions and updating. It is an invaluable contribution and will bring much understanding to the enigma that George I.

Taking what evidence there is and applying logic and intuition to the job, Patterson, the writer, director and editor, makes reasoned, and reasonable assumptions about the source and origins of the Fourth Way.

Mr. Patterson has done an excellent job of showing us what Gurdjieff meant when he said that the Fourth Way is ""completely self-supporting and independent of other lines and it has been completely unknown up to the present time."" It is fascinating to see the connections made between the hieroglyphics on the walls of the Temple of Edfu - the Seven Sages who came form the Homeland of the Primeval Ones - and what we read in Meetings With Remarkable Men, All and Everything and In Search of the Miraculous.  It is amazing that no student of the Fourth Way has explored the story of Gurdjieff's search in Egypt and Abyssinia until this video.",1188950400,5,714,4.666666666666667
2835105,5,B000QBW7KY,"The medium of video forces a discipline on creators: you have no choice but to present brief summaries of whatever subject you are dealing with. The kind of depth that exists in written works simply isn't possible. Video has its advantages, of course, but exposition isn't one of them.

Patterson, who is really a writer by trade, not a videographer, does a great job of selecting the key points he wants to communicate. He repeats them as he builds his case, step by step. He has a sincere and composed screen presence. And somehow, the atmosphere of sacredness and antiquity that this subject matter commands comes across despite the limited budget and the limited experience of these filmmakers.

Patterson has always given far too much credence to Gurdjieff and here, as usual, he simply takes everything the little cult leader said at face value; he also takes Schwaller de Lubicz's wild conjecture that the temple at Luxor is based on the human body as a given. There is much of value in de Lubicz and even Gurdjieff's phony system has elements of the real, but one must be able to separate the wheat from the chaff.

Nevertheless, the basic insights are correct. That true esoteric knowledge was transmitted from a lost civilization to ancient Egypt, and that Egypt's glyphs and monuments symbolically communicate that knowledge: these things are beyond reasonable question to the mind of anyone who is deeply familiar with the subjects (on the internal level as much as the mental; little more can be explained in words). They have been taken for granted by real occultists for more than a century. Given the rapid pace of discovery and historical revision it entails, it is likely they will be taken for granted by everyone in another century, if indeed world civilization lasts that long.

If you don't know anything about these subjects, you need this dvd badly. It could be a first step in a journey towards reality. Just be careful to always take the Gurdjieff worshippers with a grain of salt. I hate to point this out, as it will only attract the type he wants to him, but Gurdjieff is the most dangerous faux-Traditional black magician of the last century and is to be avoided. (Schwaller's works, while misguided in some ways, are nevertheless positive and ""white"".)",1186876800,6,2283,4.846153846153846

I don't know why Gurdjieff didn't say more about the origins of the teaching, but given all the inconsistent stories about its origin, I was fascinated to watch this documentary video, Gurdjieff in Egypt. William Patrick Patterson put together the pieces Gurdjieff did leave behind to reach a startling conclusion: What Gurdjieff brought to the West in the early part of the twentieth century was ancient, esoteric Christianity reformulated for the times, ""Christianity before Christ."" Egypt has always interested me and this video opened a completely new window on its art and architecture.

Gurdjieff in Egypt, Part 1
The Origin of Esoteric Knowledge 1890-1912

Reviewed by Ann Lark, Half Moon Bay, CA  (5 stars)

I first encountered G.I. Gurdjieff's teaching in the early 1980s and later in that same decade was ""active"" in a Gurdjieff group.  Yet, I never questioned the origin of the teaching.

I vaguely assumed it came from a secret brotherhood, high in the Hindu Kush, far beyond my ken or question; yet Gurdjieff told his students to question, to verify, everything for themselves.

Lucky for me, William Patrick Patterson, a longtime student of Lord John Pentland, whom Gurdjieff chose to lead The Work in America, does question everything and presents a compelling case for the origin of  esoteric knowledge that is The Fourth Way, the teaching that G.I. Gurdjieff embodied.

Patterson's reasoned conjecture indicates that prehistoric or pre-sand Egypt was Christian, in its principles, ideas and teachings, thousands of years before Christ's birth, and that the teaching Gurdjieff embodies is esoteric Christianity.

This award-winning documentary is beautifully shot on location at the Giza plateau, Thebes, Valley of the Kings, St. Petersburg and Moscow.

William Patrick Patterson wrote, directed and narrated this historical video with clear and concise language.

I'd say it is a must see for anyone with an active, inquisitive mind regarding the sense and significance of organic life on earth and human life in particular.",1192838400,6,1506,5.334745762711864
2835113,5,B000QBW7KY,"In this video, William Patrick Patterson presents the startling idea that the foundation of the Fourth Way is not (as is often supposed) Sufism, nor any contemporary esoteric teaching. Instead its source is Egypt, but ""not the Egypt we know but from one which we do not know. This Egypt was in the same place as the other but it existed much earlier."" And what is the source of this challenging proposition? Gurdjieff's own words, amplified through connections with ancient Egyptian ""mythology."" Patterson uses this idea as a platform, bolstered by remarkable on-the-scene footage of the Sphinx, the Valley of the Kings, the temple at Edfu, and the headwaters of the Nile, to explore the foundations of the Fourth Way, and to present many of the basic ideas in everyday language. This video provides new material with each viewing.

By the way, I should add that I had viewed the VHS version some years ago. Though it was strong enough to win a Gold Award for Biography at the Houston Film Festival, the DVD edition has been completely re-edited to intensify the focus on the story line, and sharpen both the audio and video qualities, resulting in a complete revamping of the original.",1192233600,9,1186,4.842364532019705

The Life and Significance of GI Gurdjieff

In ""All and Everything"" we learn Beelzebub descended to the planet Earth 6 times. In these descents he demonstrates an attitude, a methodology and an approach to seeking truth. Beelzebub recommends detailed investigations. He uses the phrases ""to clear up for oneself at all costs, to elucidate, to get to the Tzimus of the story.""  Explicitly pointed out is the necessity of not taking second- or third-hand information at face value. On the contrary, detailed investigations are demonstrated by going to the spot, in person, and verifying for oneself the truth of the matter.

I took Beelzebub's advise in relation to this film and concluded we are deeply indebted to Mr. Patterson for producing an authoritative documentary on this scale. Not only are the historical references extensively researched across professional disciplines, but they are interwoven with a poignant understanding and interpretation of the 4th way which could have only come from a disciplined life of devotion and active practicing of Gurdjieff's teaching. My only regret is not having come across this gem sooner.",1192147200,4,1154,5.295081967213115

The journey spans many years and traverses great distances. From the Levant to the Hindu Kush, Siberia, India and Tibet and also as far as the Solomon Islands.  Gurdjieff went to Egypt after meeting an Armenian priest and having seen a map of pre-sand Egypt, this being Egypt before the sands when the area had water.

-constant and exasperating repetition of published text. The word ""presand egyt"" is probably said 20 times. But to say something 20 times does not give it any validation.

I was intrigued to learn that the Temple of Man was built so that the winter solstice sun pours directly into the temple's most holy chamber and fascinated to see this actually captured on film. I was also struck by the scene at the temple at Edfu, where Patterson unexpectedly meets a local guide who chants and prays with him in the temple's holy of holies.
