While the picture quality is better than the Vhs version and looks good but not great, the audio has a major problem.

This film was originally filmed with a Dolby Stereo 2.0 track but on this DVD the audio is just in 2.0 MONO!

880504,4,630440641X,"Get out the popcorn and get your friends together for this one. Jinxed is the funny and cute story about a ""jinxed"" blackjack dealer Willie (Ken Wahl --HOT!!) who is being followed from job to job by a gambler (Rip Torn) and his wife (Midler), as they make money off him!  Naturaly, Willie can't keep a job, until one day he meets up with Midler and they have some steamy love scenes and they fall in love. One problem--her husband is a possessive, abusive low-life who won't allow her to leave him.  So Midler and Willie devise a scheme to murder her husband and run off together with his life insurance policy and gambling winnings!  Not all goes according to plan, and there are some big surprises and laughs along the way.

This is one of those movies where everything is quite absurd, but lovable and fun just the same. The plot is actually quite clever and the performances are very good.  Just a light, funny, so-bad-its-good movie that would be entertaining to just about anyone. Yeah, it was a flop, but that's part of its charm.  Lighten up and enjoy it!",1104192000,9,1064,4.515625

The best performance comes from Rip Torn and he dies half way into the picture.  Ken Wahl as a love interest for Bette?  I don't think so.  He looked like he wanted to leave the movie, hunt down his agent, ""Wiseguy"" style and waste 'em.  I have never given a Bette Midler movie a bad review, but this one IS BADDDDD!!!  Its so bad the DVD comes with its own odor.  Its a stink-a-roo.  It gets one extra star because I did laugh twice, and one scene was very funny.  It had nothing to do with the movie, but it was funny.  This movie makes ""Rhinestone"" shine if one could imagine that possible.  However, if you collect Bette movies then you must own this one.  Its safe there will be no sequel, and I think she's learned not to do lame comedies.  No, wait!  Well you really can't count that sitcom, can you?  Ouch!",1102723200,3,941,4.358381502890174

There was more drama behind the scenes to this movie than  the movie itself. Based on the movie DOUBLE INDEMNITY with Barbra Stanwick,  a story of how a woman tries to kill her husband, collect the money and run  off with her new love. Bette adds a little humour to the role. The  highlight, of course, is the shower scene with her dead husband and black  humour. If you're a Midler fan, it would be interesting to see her in this  film in her early comic stages.

The Movie about gambling, rich and greed.  Watch out for the very end of the movie, which was an ending I always remembered since I first saw it during the 80's.  I think it's worth watching and enjoyed reliving the moments.",1325376000,,753,4.427536231884058
880936,2,630440641X,"This movie has some stars in it, but none of them get to shine. Bette sings, but unless you were watching, you couldn't really tell. There were a few moments of Bette's voice coming through but not enough to make it worthwhile.
Bette plays an abused woman, which I didn't find at all funny. Ican't really see Bette putting up with that sort of garbage, but the movie would have you believe she did.
Rip Torn plays the abusive husband who is also a gambler. He's all rotten things rolled up in one package. Rip is also portrayed as sort of a pervert. But together, Rip plays blackjack and Bette watches the ""pigeon"".
And the ""pigeon"" is played by Ken Wahl, the poor black jack dealer that always loses to Rip Torn. I'm not sure if he was there just for beefcake or what. Ken meets Bette when Ken follows Bette and Rip's car home. Ken is hoping to find something of Rip's so he can break the ""jinx"".
Ken finds Bette at home, strips off his shirt and voila sexual chemistry fills the air. Nah, I'm joking because Ken and Bette have no onscreen chemistry. Both of them look like they would rather have an anal probe from aliens than be in the same room with each other.
So Bette and Ken cook up the plot to kill off Rip. Rip has a hojillion dollars in insurance, so Bette would have lots of money. Ken would be rid of his jinx and everybody would live happily ever after.
It's difficult to have much sympathy for any of the characters except Angus, the black cat. Plus Rip Torn dies about halfway into the film, so he gets to cut out early on this snoozer.
If you love Bette and must have all her films, than you should acquire it. Don't spend a lot of money, just look at the $1 DVD displays at any store.

As Bette would say with that sparkle in her eye (stealing from Sam Golwyn knowing she'd charm it out of him anyway) ""the audience stayed away in droves..."".  But boy howdy did they miss a rollicking farce with a Tour de Force performance from Rip Torn (who could have given Bernie lessons) as her dead husband in the second half of the film.  The only time I've seen a corpse upstage both Bette and Ken Wahl (who was hotter than hot at that moment and looked it...tho his troubles were rumored to begin on this set because he'd been brought in as eye candy for the ladies).  Why he didn't get nominated for an Oscar I'll never know (Rip Torn not Ken Wahl)!  And of course Bette is no shrinking violet in these hijinks and you get your money's worth in several scenes that are priceless even today.  So I say buy it and see it for yourself...you'll laugh...you'll cry...you'll check your burial insurance.

If you love Bette Midler than maybe you should rent it or buy for less than a buck but other than that she has few one liners and plays a con artist who hates her husband.  Bette's charming personality doesn't shine in this movie like in Beaches or Stella instead it is annoying like her character in The Rose.  Overall the plot is redundant and spins in circles.  Mr. Wahl looks great physically and the women might like that aspect of this movie.,1144281600,4,593,4.306306306306307

Yes, the movie can't decide what it wants to be...black comedy, romantic comedy or drama with a murder twist. Yes, there was no chemistry between Wahl and Midler. Yes, there was tons of back stage fighting between Wahl, Midler and the director.

However, the film does have its good points. Hear me out. The second half of the film (after Rip Thorn commits suicide) is laugh out loud funny. The tumble weed scene still cracks me up. The look on Midler's face after the weed hit her is priceless. The scene with Miss Nina is always a gas. And the line Midler shouts at the insurance man is still one of my all time favorite Midler lines ever. ""Talk to my a**! My head's had enough!""

The film had the potential to be a really good black comedy. I've always wondered just what happened with this film. Outside of the whole in fighting between the principles. Something just didn't translate from script to screen. This film had to look better on paper. I'd love to see some of the deleted scenes to see if there was someway to piece together the rather disjointed plot. Maybe in the future some one will dig those up.

Anyway, the film is worth one viewing just for the second half. Not recmended for the average viewer, but if you're a Bette fan like me, then this movie is a must see. If just to see if what everyone says about it is true.",1142899200,16,1458,4.294545454545455

7871675,2,630440641X,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I remember when this movie was released and hearing about the friction between co-stars Bette Midler and Ken Wahl. Midler had won rave reviews for her performance 3 years earlier in THE ROSE. Wahl was an up and coming actor noted for his looks coming off of a string of moderately successful films like FORT APACHE THE BRONX and SOLDIER. Apparently during the filming the two crashed frequently and the pair, lovers in the film, both described how unpleasant it was to kiss each other.

But the one thing that got me the most was hearing Midler complain about the director of the film. She talked about how he didn't know what he was doing and how he had it in for her. Those comments cemented her in my mind as a diva at the time. Why? The director she claimed was terrible was Don Siegel, the director of films like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, HELL IS FOR HEROES, THE SHOOTIST, ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ and DIRTY HARRY. Comparing that resume with her one previous starring role made me think the friction was directed at her so much as emanating from her.

After watching this movie for the first time some 34 years later my beliefs were confirmed. The film studio centered the film around Midler trying to cash in on her popularity at the time and it shows. The film revolves around her making most of the other characters seem like side notes. Worse yet the trailer for the film, included on this blu-ray release, also showcases her and makes the movie seem like a hilarious new comedy. If that was what they were going for they failed miserably.

The story begins with Harry Benson (Rip Torn), a high rolling gambler, playing blackjack at the table of Willie Brodax (Wahl). As it unfolds we discover that Harrys playing at Willies table in Las Vegas cost Willie his job as Benson always seemed to win at his table. The same happens here and Willie loses yet another job.

Midler stars as Bonita Friml, a lounge singer and Harrys girlfriend whose grown weary of Harrys rough ways but stays with him with nowhere else to go. When she asks Harry why he continues to play Willies tables he lets her know that its a bit of luck that follows the two of them where ever they go. Willie will deal and Harry will win no matter what the costs to Willie.

Willie gets a new job and Harry of course shows. When Willie talks to his boss about it the boss tells him that hes jinxed and that the only way he can break the jinx is to take something of Harrys. So of course he sets his eyes on Bonita who is all too willing. Bonita comes up with a solution to their problem: kill Harry and shell cash in his insurance and the two can live happily ever after. What should have been a comedy of errors falls flat from here on in. Not only that the buildup to this point was slow and not the least bit funny.

The number of things wrong with this movie are too many to count but here are a few. Its not funny to begin with. Im talking serious lack of laughs here. Midlers acting may have grown later but here her performance is too big and suited for the stage than it is a movie. Wahls part seems tiny in comparison and hes given little to do let alone act with. Torn seems to be making time and collecting a check. From the look of things Siegel apparently had too many chiefs on this film telling him what to do. One of those items was the music for the film. Siegel had Lalo Shiffrin record the soundtrack which the studio tossed and replaced. It was a major mistake as the score here is terrible and uses light hearted tones where not needed as if to say hey this is a funny flick when it isnt.

Midler has grown into a much better actress. Wahls career took a nosedive until 1987 when he struck gold with the TV series WISEGUY. Unfortunately for Siegel this was the last movie he ever did, an unfitting farewell for a fantastic director. Fans of the stars might want to add this to their collection for that reason alone. Siegel fans will only want to pick it up to make sure they have everything he ever did in their collection even if they never watch it. Other than those few my suggestion is to avoid this one, it truly is that bad.",1462752000,,4183,4.319745222929936

Ms. Midler said at that time of the original release that it was the first documented case of projectus interruptus.  ""It was pulled out of the theaters before it came.""
The movie is at best a curiosity.  At worst, it's just an awful waste of your time and Midler's talent.  It might be worth watching if you have nothing else to do and have seen every other movie ever made.",1461196800,,542,4.424242424242424
