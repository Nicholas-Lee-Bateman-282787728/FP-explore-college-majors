7949282,4,B00005OW0Q,"Pride 4 saw the first of the ""Ukraine-Machine""  and the last (in Pride) of the best of the Gracie's. Overall an OK card with some good and bad fights.
Fights that are worth mentioning are the Wallid Ismail/Akira Shoji fight. A little bit of a surprise, considering the reputation of the individual who choked Royce Gracie out in a BJJ match getting rocked and eventually Ko'd!
The Otsuka/Ruas was the shocker of the night. Watch as a pro-wrestler takes advantage of an ill MMA legend.
The fight of the night was the Sakuraba/Goes fight. Before Sak took the world (and the Gracies) by storm, he had to deal with a crafty BJJ vet in Allan Goes. The fight was a see-saw battle of two great submission fighters. These guys really put on a good show.
The Main Event was a rematch of the Main Event of Pride I. Pro-wrestler Nobuhiko Takada was back (unfortunately) to face Rickson Gracie. In their first encounter, Rickson steamrolled over the inexperienced Takada. This fight would be a little longer, but with no true surprises. The Japanese fans demanded the rematch, and Rickson agreed to the lucrative contract....again going for the payday instead of engaging against a formidable opponent.",1011225600,2,1190,4.833333333333333
7949283,4,B00005OW0Q,"This DVD has it's share of greatness. And a dominace of matches between Japan and Brazil. Featuring the Great Rickson Gracie, and about every Takada Dojo member there is. This Card had it's share of Action, but overall it is slow. Not alot of action, far inferior to Pride 10. Which is in my opinon still the best assembled card.",1010016000,,329,4.5
7949284,5,B00005OW0Q,"Pride 4 was on October 11, 1998 at the Tokyo Dome.
The first fight is between IFC 1 tournament winner, WVC 5 tournament winner and AFC 3 tournament winner Igor Vovchanchyn and UFC 8 finalist and IVC 1 tournament winner Gary Goodridge. This is a good fight with a great ending.
The second fight is between Lumax Cup 1997 and Pride veteran Akira Shoji and Universal Vale Tudo, IVC and UFC 12 veteran Wallid Ismael. Great fight with a great ending.
The third fight is between Pride veteran Daijiro Matsui and Lumax Cup and Japan Vale Tudo 1996 veteran Sanae Kikuta. A slow fight but a interesting one.
The fourth fight is between UFC Japan tournament winner and Pride veteran Kazushi Sakuraba and Pancrase, Extreme Fighting and UFC 17 veteran Allan Goes. Great fight but the ending is not great. I want a rematch between these two great fighters.
The fifth fight is between K-1 veteran Satoshi Homna and Pride veteran Yuhi Sano. This is one of the most one-sided matches I have seen, but it is good.
The sixth fight is between pro wrestler Alexander Otsuka and UFC 7 tournament winner, World Vale Tudo and Pride veteran Marco Ruas. This is one interesting fight.
The seventh fight is between WVC 3 tournament winner, UFC 14 & 15 tournament winner and Pride veteran Mark Kerr and Universal Vale Tudo and UFC 17 veteran Hugo Duarte. This is another interesting fight.
The main event is between Pride veteran Nobuhiko Takada and Japan Vale Tudo 1994 and 1995 tournament winner Rickson Gracie. This fight is better than the one at Pride 1.
I recommand this show anyone who likes MMA.",1007424000,5,1576,4.672661870503597
