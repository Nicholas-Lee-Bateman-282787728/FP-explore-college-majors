However if and when the time comes I will at least have some sort of idea as to what to check for and where to start. All his videos are really great. I think we own just about every one of them now.

8330278,5,B001OBMPAM,"If picture is a thousand words, a video is much more.  While these care and maintenance tips are in books and manuels, watching the procedures be done and explained make it easier to do and remember.  Being new to RVing meant a lot of getting up to speed to ensure proper care and preparation so we could protect our RV and keep it safe for traveling.  This is particularly helpful for those not mechanically inclined or who did not grow up RVing.",1324252800,11,447,4.426829268292683
