6987784,5,B00SJC9WV4,"This was a terribly difficult movie for me to watch. This is because I am 66 years old. My father got Alzheimer's around age 80 and died a very slow and debilitating death. Then my mother got the same disease at 90. I suppose we are lucky that we do not have the early onset version but it is very hard to use the work luck in reference to this disease in any way. The main character wishes at one point that she had cancer instead. I've already had cancer and I agree that cancer is a much easier disease and death.

Everyone involved with this film does their best to bring out all emotional and physical facets of this disease. Nothing is sugar coated or trivialized. Moore does a tour de force acting job. I'm sure this year's Oscar is hers. Alec Baldwin does a fine job playing her husband. The meetings they have to go through with the medical higher ups are enough to give you nighmares for a month.

Alice carries a gene for early onset Alzheimer's.  She is 50. Her father passed the disease to her. She in turn will be passing It to at least some of her children.

It is an excellent film but you are duly warned that this is heavy subject matter. If you need a light, escapist movie, this is NOT it.",1424563200,8,1209,4.220779220779221
6987785,4,B00SJC9WV4,"I wish I had cancer, confesses Alice Howland, as she expresses her frustration with her growing Alzheimers. In Still Alice, the beautiful and affecting adaptation of the book by Lisa Genova, we experience Alices disease not as a handicap, but as a bold affirmer. Its a daring and beautiful film, that is both delicate and genuine. A game-changing performance from Julianne Moore keeps the character Alice afloat, as we see the damage being done both physically and emotionally.

As the signs of Alzheimers disease continue to afflict Alice, we see the effects it has on both her and her loved ones. In one scene, she flubs up her words at a lecture. In another, she quizzes herself to remember a series of words after 10 minutes. But these don't stop the disease from doing its worst. Director Richard Glatzer employs smart filmmaking to remind us how awful Alzheimers really can be. Some great allegories in the script and some excellent visual imagery paint us the scenario around Alices disease. Its precise filmmaking with great attention to detail.

Some comparisons have been made to typical Nicholas Sparks novels, and while I think those comparisons are just, they don't quite have the same layers of complexity that Still Alice does. We see what goes on in Alices head, as Julianne Moores outstanding performance keeps us engaged. The look of lostness on her face, the shaking of her hands, her verbal blunders are all on display here, highlighting the frustration that Alzheimers patients and their loved ones have. Moore is simply a revelation. I wasn't sure about all the awards buzz she was receiving prior to seeing the film, but she deserves every last ounce of it. Moore deserves her (first!) Oscar for this role, one that solidifies her as a classical talent.

The rest of the supporting cast fares well. Kristin Stewart is a marvel as Alices daughter Lydia, who takes care of Alice the most. The two have a special bond, with scenes that are tough to watch but ones that Im sure many will relate to. Lydia has been shaped by her mother, and Im sure it is hard to watch that bond fade. Stewart is quickly growing into one of the finest actresses of her age, and she nails the role. A miscast Alec Baldwin, unfortunately, takes up a bit too much screen time as Alices wife. I have a hard time separating Baldwin from his work on 30 Rock, so he seems a bit too distracting amidst all of the genuine talent onscreen.

The best part about Still Alice, though, is its optimism. A great scene about two-thirds of the way through the film finds Alice giving a speech at an Alzheimers association. With brilliant camera work and a sweeping score, its a doozy of a scene. This is Moores Oscar reel right here. But this scene is beautiful. It handles Alzheimers with such delicacy and passion that youll walk away feeling simply inspired. A big theme throughout Still Alice is memory, as a few flashbacks to Alices youth remind us of that, and as Alice struggles to hold on to the memories its riveting to watch. Still Alice is a beautiful reminder that we should cherish every moment. Brilliant direction and great performances across the board result in a resounding win, a film that everyone should see, young or old.",1423958400,15,3227,4.726465364120782
6987786,4,B00SJC9WV4,"What married couple would go see a movie about Alzheimer's disease on Valentine's Day? Yup, that would be us. The things I do for my Valentine!

Dr. Alice Howard (Julianne Moore) is a distinguished linguistics professor at Columbia University who learns she has early-onset Alzheimer's. She and her family struggle together as the disease advances. This is a decent flick with many heart-wrenching moments. Moore definitely deserves her Oscar nomination. Kate Bosworth is very good as the cattish older daughter, Anna, while I found Kristen Stewart to be a bit annoying as the younger ""black sheep"" daughter, Lydia.

My Mom had Alzheimer's so this story was uncomfortably familiar at times. Kudos to Still Alice for bringing awareness about Alzheimer's to the general public.",1423958400,3,775,5.2926829268292686
6987787,5,B00SJC9WV4,"I had read Lisa Genova's book before seeing the movie, and I am glad I did.  Because I knew what was coming at every turn my attention was more free to focus on the nuances of the acting.  The novel contained a great deal of scientific/medical information about Alzheimers, genetic testing, and this was useful background.  The book  provided a kind of footnotes to the movie.  The movie left out a lot of this detail (but nothing that was necessary for your  understanding of what was happening.)  But the movie did a beautiful rendering  of  the relationships among the characters, and especially in showing the experience through the eyes of the person who has Alzheimers.  Julianne Moore deserves all the kudos she has been getting, and will probably receive a long-deserved Oscar for this role.  Both the script (which stayed very close to the novel) and her realization were incredibly sensitive and poignant.  The movie does a succinct but very successful job of portraying the characters surrounding Alice, and the impact that her decline has on them:  the self-centered husband
who runs away, and the strong and independent daughter who comes close.

There have been few books, dramas, information sources, that have focused on the experience of Alzheimers from the perspective of the patient.  Most of the material focuses on what caregivers need to know about the progress of the disease.  The very title of the book and movie, ""Still Alice"" are a manifestation of the focus on showing that a person who has Alzheimers remains whole with respect to emotion, human interaction, sensation, for a long time even as their cognitive skills decline.  Even near the very end, Alice is, at a fundamental emotional level, still Alice.  This is what Lisa Genova wanted us to understand.  The movie goes well beyond the book in manifesting this persisting and real humanity.",1423872000,55,1874,4.967845659163987
6987788,3,B00SJC9WV4,"""Still Alice"" (2014 release; 99 min.) brings the (fictional) story of Alice Howland, successful professor of linguistics at Columbia University. As the movie opens, the family has gathered to celebrate Alice's 50th birthday. But it isn't long before Alice experiences unexplained memory loss, ""as if the world dropped from under my feet"", as Alice explains it later: she loses her train of thought at a conference in LA, she gets lost on a run near Columbia, etc. We're not event 20 min. into the movie when the medical verdict from her neurologist comes in: Early-Onset Alzheimer's. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the best-selling 2007 novel of the same name by Lisa Genova. I haven't read the book so I cannot comment how close the movie stays to the book (or not). Before I go any further, I should mention that my dad, a brilliant man and successful banker, suffered Alzheimer's shortly after retiring and descended into a 15+ yr. battle with the disease until he passed away some years ago. I can't help but compare what I witnessed first hand with what is portrayed in this movie, and while of course there are elements of truth in the movie, the movie doesn't even come close to fully capturing the horrible nature of this disease. Setting my personal experience aside for a minute, this movie just isn't that good, frankly. Yes, there is the towering performance by Julianne Moore and it's almost a given that she'll win the Best Actress Oscar, and deservedly so (as much for this movie's performance as it is for her entire career output). But there is a reason that this movie didn't score any other Oscar nominations. Too many things were simply ""off"" for me, such as: why would Alice's husband (played by Alec Baldwin) continue to work as if nothing has changed? Unrealistic to me. So you take away Julianne Moore (and an equally surprisingly good Kristen Stewart as the 'rebellious' daughter/struggling theater actress), and what you have here is an utterly conventional and by-the-numbers TV movie. I wish I could be more positive, but in the end I was surprised (and let down) how predictable this movie is. Great cause (Alzheimer's), outstanding lead performance (Julianne Moore), but in the end ""Still Alice"" is a missed opportunity to spotlight a terrible disease.

The movie finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I had been looking forward to this for weeks, and went to see it right away. The early evening screening where I saw this at today was, much to my surprise, poorly attended. Julianne Moore's performance will carry this movie through the Oscar season, but given the so-so quality of the movie and also that this isn't the type of movie where you leave the theater thinking ""that was a jolly good time!"", I can't see this movie breaking out big. That sais, I encourage you to check out ""Still Alice"", be it in theaters, here on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",1423785600,48,3118,4.815298507462686
6987789,3,B00SJC9WV4,"Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's ""Still Alice"" is an earnest, decent film about one woman's tragic deterioration, featuring a superb, deeply moving performance by Julianne Moore. Moore plays Alice Howland, a linguistics professor at Columbia University, happily married with three beautiful grown children, whose perfect life is interrupted by sudden, inexplicable lapses in memory. She forgets the words she wants to use in class, and gets lost on the campus where she has worked for years. Soon she receives the diagnosis: early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

Moore makes Alice's fear palpable, and you will really feel for her when she invents computer and cell phone games for herself, struggling to remember common words and, finally, the names of her own children. If the rest of the film were as excellent as she is, it would be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, every other character in ""Still Alice"" is a stock character. Even Alec Baldwin, who can be unforgettable given the right material, is consigned to a purely reactive role as Alice's husband. Once Alice receives her diagnosis, the story basically goes on autopilot, except for a fairly easy-to-guess mystery involving a computer message Alice leaves for herself. ""Still Alice"" is worth seeing for Moore's performance, but not memorable except for her.",1423785600,9,1319,5.371980676328502
6987790,4,B00SJC9WV4,"From director Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland is the story about a cognitive psychology professor who develops a rare form of Alzheimers disease at a young age of 50. As she copes with the disease her life starts to deteriorate right before her familys eyes. In a heartbreaking drama Still Alice sees Julianne Moore at her best. She is co-starred with Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin, and Kate Boseworth. The movie is also based off the book by Lisa Genova.

The movie wasn't advertised or previewed much in theaters and is a shame because it really is a great movie. Now its not a feel good film and it deals with a very serious condition that people can relate to. Julianne Moore plays a professor, Alice Howland, who begins to forget words, phrases, and locations that eventually leads her to a neurologist where she is then diagnosed with the disease. Her husband John, played by Alec Baldwin, is the first to discover his wifes condition and doesnt take too kindly of it. Then the family is summoned together to let her children know that their mom has an early onset of Alzheimers disease. And more unfortunate is the fact that it can be passed on by genes and that possibly her children can carry the disease.

I try to imagine what it would be like for either myself or someone I know to go through such a condition and could only think how damaging it can be for everyone involved. Of the three kids, Lydia (Kristen Stewart) is the one that gets impacted most as she wants to become an actress. Her mom sees her doing other things and going to school but isn't what Lydia wants to do. With her mothers condition worsening it has an affect on Lydia to reach out to her mom and understand what its like to live with the disease. From someone with a successful career and author of various books to then losing her most cherished thoughts is like living in a thick fog. You could appreciate Stewarts performance here because of how difficult the role can be for anyone who has to live with it. It may be one of very few roles that Stewart excels at.

One of the most touching moments in the film takes place when Alice has to put together a speech for an Alzheimers conference. At this point she has to highlight the lines as shes reading them so that she doesnt forget what she last said. But its the speech that so many people can appreciate because for anyone who has to live with the disease it can mean so much to someone to know that not all memories will be forgotten. And for Alice, the speech is something she will never forget. The scene also praised Alice for all of her work and sacrifices she made for her family to get to where she is now in her career by the way she was introduced with applause by the audience in the beginning and end of the speech.

Alec Baldwin was great in the movie because he was so dedicated to his wife that even with the diseases progression he stood by her side. When John asked Alice if they were going to go running she went inside the house to go to the restroom. However, she got lost and didn't know where the bathroom was and was going door to door trying to find it. By the time John found her downstairs she had made a mess of herself. Baldwins character was sympathetic and caring that he truly stood out considering how difficult the material is. Its a reality for everyone to not take things for granted and to be gentle with those in need.

Everyone should go watch Still Alice when they have the opportunity to because it not only was acted well but you get a genuine look into what Alzheimers disease is. Julianne Moore did an excellent job as Alice and you could feel for her. Same goes for Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart as they help their mom cope with the disease until she becomes a shell of herself. In the final shot we see Lydia and Alice just return home from sitting at a park. Its then that Lydia reads a poem to her mom about love. Alice at this point is no longer able to speak sentences but when asked by her daughter what she just read Alice slowly spews out the word love.  As hard as it is to see that you also appreciate at how strong Alice is and the will she has to continue living on. It sends a powerful message to everyone that not all is lost and those you love will be there to help you get through it.",1423267200,35,4296,4.3304347826086955
6987791,5,B00SJC9WV4,"""Still Alice"" really holds a personal place in my heart. First of all Julianne Moore has been one of my favorite actresses ever since she graced our daytime TV screens on ""As the World Turns"". Since that time she has appeared in several successful films, been nominated for four Oscars and is regarded this year as the guaranteed winner for Best Actress for ""Still Alice"".  Another reason the movie resonates with me is beacuse as a year ago a dear personal friend of mine was diagnosed with the early onslaught of Alzheimer's Disease. He is now in a Nursing Home. He is only 53 years old.

 The movie chronicles the life of Alice, an intelligent woman who is a professor of linguistics at Columbia University who suddenly finds her life turned upside down when she begins to lose her memory. Gradually things get worse and she is diagnosed with the early onslaught of Alzheimer's Disease. The movie shows how Alice bravely deals with the disease in her work, with her family and with herself.

 For me the most daring part of the character of Alice was her bravery and staunch firmness on not allowing this disease to control her, but to control it.

 ""Still Alice"" is mesmerizing with exciting performances by all in the film especially Alec Baldwin who plays Alice's husband, but it is Julianne Moore who delivers the performance of a lifetime. 2015 will be the year Julianne Moore finally wins the Academy Award as Best Actress.

 And on February 22, 2015 Julianne Moore was indeed named Best Actress at the Academy Awards, an award that was well deserved and long over due.",1423094400,173,1578,4.709090909090909
6987792,3,B00SJC9WV4,"This is a film for those who like heavy depressing drama, but not for those who have lived with the gut wrenching experiences it deals with.  Not a escapism movie.  Nor does it have a uplifting ending.  The acting is good and the storyline deals with a woman who has been a world famous linguistic expert who is now dealing with early on-set Alzheimer's and you watch her slowly dissolve.  Her husband is on the cusp of moving ahead in his career and choses to move on.  The disease is hereditary and she has three kids.  Two chose to test for it.  One is negative and the other her pregnant daughter is positive.  If you like deep human drama you will give this watch.  Many women will like this.",1422489600,5,697,4.341085271317829
6987793,5,B00SJC9WV4,"This is a very sad  but realistic portrait of what is like to go through an early onset Alzheimers diagnosis from the perspective of the previously dynamic and successful person going through it.  We experience it with Alice mostly through her eyes . Julianne Moore's delivery of such difficult subject matter is raw and believable and truly her finest work to date. She neither overplays or underplays the various aspects common to people with this disease. I felt like I was peering into someone with this disease's window. The story simply unfolds before you.

This movie appealed to me because it focuses on the experience and feelings of the person with the diagnosis. It shows how it may be easy to forget that Alzheimer's first and foremost is happening to the person who has the Alzheimer's. It shows how the slow loss one one's self is just as painful for the person going through it as those around them, at least for a time.

 I found myself annoyed when some of Alice's family talked like she was not even there, even early on in her diagnosis. I imagine this is very common and eventually necessary.

 I loved the speech Alice gave at the Alzheimer's convention which pinpoints what it's like to still be aware of your own dwindling capacity and also being able to perceive others viewing and treating you differently.

There is an area of this movie that may bother some; where Alice preplans a suicide while she is still coherent via a video to herself for a later time.  Truly driving home how hard it is to follow even simple instructions in advanced stages, we see Alice attempt several times over to follow the instructions she left herself in the video and fail to do so.  It was a very powerful and jarring moment.

The subject matter was intense but this movie attempts to balance the heavy subject with some humor and tender moments and a sense of respect for the diagnosis nobody wants to hear but many do. Very well done and I can see why Julianne Moore has received awards for this role.",1422316800,144,2013,4.610644257703081

6987823,5,B00SJC9WV4,"I loved this movie.  It depicted a horrible condition and its effects on a woman who was happy, talented, and in the prime of her life.  My only caveats to my five star rating is the casting.  Kristen Scott Thomas cannot act, and Julianne Moore, while excellent, does not look like the typical 50 year old.  In the scenes with her daughters they looked like sisters.  Alec Baldwin does not look or seem at all like a biologist.  My only other concern is the fact that she would had to have had her children at a very young age.  Most women at that time who had kids at 25 (she was 50 in the movie, and her oldest child was in med school, so at least 25) did not go one to pursue a PhD, especially to have two more children.  (Most women of that age with a PhD got their degree first then had kids later in their 30's.)  It's possible, but rare, and since her genetics of early onset Alzheimers was also rare it seemed unrealistic to have two rarities in one film.

6987838,5,B00SJC9WV4,Loved this movie as it gave me an idea of what Alzheimers is like for the person with it and the caretaker\family member dealing with it. I wish more people could see this movie so that they will know what dementia or Alzheimers looks like and why it is a disease that needs more research. I am concerned that it is mostly seen n women.

I loved the way she was able to give a lot of descriptions and explainations of why things  were happening.  For those not familiar with AD, it helps one to understand it a little better.

6987842,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Strongly recommend anyone dealing with Alzheimer's in their friends or relatives, to watch this powerful portrayal by Julianne Moore.  One really experiences how each family member is affected by this early onset disease  in their spouse/mother, a successful career woman. We still have so much to learn about this disease.  Everyone should treasure their thinking abilities, not take a day for granted, and keep one's brain active.
Care providers can benefit from this as well, for it takes a toll on everyone, requires different techniques to manage a patient who is frightened and lost within themselves.  It is truly ""the long goodbye"" when a person's identity and memories are gone, but the body remains and slowly declines with the aging process.",1511827200,,752,5.190082644628099

We get a good glimpse into the descending fog that envelopes a person with Alzheimer's and how devastating that is. That being said, this film falls short when it comes to the changing family dynamics that come into play as this disease progresses. Other than Kristen Stewart's character you could have left all the rest of the family members out of the film and it wouldn't have made a difference, which is a shame because anyone who's been involved with a family member with Alzheimer's knows that relationships can be strained to utter heartbreak, and you don't get that here. It's still a good film to watch just to get a sense of what this disease is all about, but it stops short of the tsunami on the horizon, to be sure, there's no happy ending.",1505088000,,830,4.614864864864865

The cast is wonderful; Alex Baldwin as Alice's long-time loving husband, portrays a man deeply conflicted between devotion to his wife and dealing with her rapid mental decline.  Kristen Stewart is superb as the youngest of the 3 adult children, giving a strong, honest, heart-wrenching performance.

The message we received was that if you're smart, you'll kill yourself.  Fortunately, you'll probably screw that up due to your disease and you'll suffer until the end of the movie, which ends before anything happens.

6988019,5,B00SJC9WV4,"I admit that Julianne Moore can never be Meryl Streep  . Yes she cannot be.
But Don't you think that she is a great great actress?
Think about it at the age of maybe 40 something she acted the roll of Clarice Starling which is suppose to be maybe 23 or something and I totally believed it. She was loosing over maybe 60-70 pounds and in perfect shape. Also her behavior as young girl was so so perfect that no one will come out and say hey woman you are too old for the roll. Why don't you just think it over sometimes. You are too greedy.
No sir, mam. She is a cameleon.

In this movie she acted as a professor a clever woman who is about 50 and happens to find out that she is now having a Alzheimer's Disease.
Now everything is torned apart.
Also her diseas will decented to her children. Her daughers too.
But the most problem is she will not remember things from now on. Seriously she is asking things that she already asked in 2 minutes ago.
That's not everything. She doesn't even remember where the bathroom is and she wets her pants when she was about to go out with her husband.

The way how she is suffering was so so real that makes us cry and feel the pain together.
This ain't the stupid <Love & Other Drugs> movie.
It is a serious movie about pain, slowly fading away woman and her suffering family story.

You will feel sad but also enjoy the masterful actress and be thankful that you are living with the one of the greatest actress breathing together living in the same earth.

The music is rather invisible but ok.
The cinematography is good.
The other actors are all good.
Alec Baldwin , the husband was a heartwarming husband who understands her and loves her all the way guy.
The daughter Kristen Stewart is like always is rebellion but charming lady.
And so on.

The budget of the movie was really small which was  $5,000,000 . All the actors received really small money for the guarantee include risten Stewart.
The film gained about 18,656,400 (USA) which is also very small but was from the limited release.
It gained more money from the video and TV.

You should watch this movie.",1471737600,,2107,4.357142857142857

6988028,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Heartbreaking movie about what it means to be relatively young (50 years old) and extremely intelligent and suddenly realizing that a person is afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.  Julianne Moore has deservedly won a best Actress prize for her performance in this movie.  She plays a successful woman who is academic and has lovely family with three grown up children.  Her husband is also researcher and they seem to have ideal life together.  Who can ask more - Alice is teaching at Columbia University, she is a published author and full of life.  She is not only smart but also beautiful.  Alec Baldwin plays her husband who is stunned to learn that Alice is terminally ill and has difficult time coming to terms with her diagnosis.  But so does the rest of her family - her children.  I really loved Kristen Stewart in her role of Alice's youngest daughter who is rebellious, reluctant to attend college and fiercely determined to make her own way in the world on her own terms.  It is no surprise that at the end, Alice is helped during her health decline by her youngest child.

Story is very strong and very believable.  It got me thinking about my won mortality and really wishing that one day, every state in our country will legalize euthanasia for the people who just know how they wish to end their last days on this earth - on their own terms and with unwavering dignity, without being financial and emotional burden to their own family members or society.

The book is a quick read about early-onset alzheimer's disease.  It is not as depressing as one would expect, but instead I found it very interesting and informative.

It is interesting that the author uses the perspective of Alice, as her condition is first diagnosed and then deteriorates.  This draws the reader in, as you find yourself admiring Alice's courage and strength.  It also provides a realistic perspective of the devastation this disease delivers to family members, who struggle with caregiving, life decisions, and even hereditary implications.",1469318400,,661,5.247619047619048

I was sorry that the movie didn't take the story further but perhaps the book the movie was based on ended early in the character's journey. There is so much more to tell about the daily life of someone afflicted with this disease.

6988124,2,B00SJC9WV4,"I read the book to this movie a while back. The movie I had high hopes for but to me in comparison to the book it fell short. I felt the portrayal of John was off, he is supposed to be this scatter brained scientist that relied on his overly organized and extremely intelligent wife to keep him organized. Alice also has a very close and loving intellectual relationship with her two very successful kids and a very tense relationship with Lydia. The movie does touch on this but I felt it was critical to emphasize these relationship roles in the beginning when Alice is completely there to show the real sadness in what is happening not only to Alice but in the family dynamic. As Alice slips away in the book her husband John and son Tom begin to devote their lives to curing her. I know there was kind of brought up however, in the book they began to treat Alice as a lab rat. Like she no longer existed as a person but as a specimen. The older daughter Anne still loves her mother but treats her as a burden and a child. Lydia is the only person willing to give Alice the freedom and push to keep grasp on the person she once was. I did feel the movie made a good show of how that was. Even more so than the book. I loved the end. In the book Alice is visiting with her grandchildren and doesn't recognize any of the people around her. It was a sad and very true ending. The movie I think ended on a note of hope. Having Lydia read a beautiful passage from a play and ask her mother about it showed that Alice is still in there somewhere.
  I think movie had some good points, but the story and character development could have been much better. I wanted to see Alice before she started slipping. I wanted a sense of this amazing person that she was so that I too could feel the sadness of loss as I watched her disease (I hate this term btw) play out to the end. I wanted the hot tension between Alice and Lydia to be known so it was all the more heart warming and admirable when you saw Lydia give up everything and be there for Alice when no one else was. The film had great potential and an amazing cast. If it had been done a little differently then I believe there isn't a person alive that wouldn't have watched it without feeling raw emotion. For me it lacked.",1462579200,6,2273,4.163636363636364
6988125,5,B00SJC9WV4,There are no words to describe how beautifully done this movie was. No doubt in my mind why Julianne Moore won Best Actress for her role.

One day during a presentation she seem to forget her subject matter, but why she knew the material so well, it was like second nature to her.  Should she tell her family or keep it a secret. Family begin to notice some changes within her, but didn't make a comment. Alice finally decided to go to the doctors and discovered that she had Early-Onset Alzheimer's. How could this be, she was young and had a lot more life in her? She knew she couldn't hide it for long so she decided to tell her husband (played by Alec Baldwin).

6988150,4,B00SJC9WV4,"I consider watching Still Alice a major accomplishment as I usually get around to watching the years award winning movies about fifteen years after they came out and that might be generous. In Still Alice, Julianne Moore gives a high quality performance as a linguistics professor who is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers disease. What makes it particularly jarring was that as a professor, her knowledge and intellect are how she makes a living. Viewers are taken on a long road of her deterioration and the impact that it has on close friends and family members.

The fundamental question ends up being how does one feel about the portrayal of Alzheimers disease in the film? Many describe it as an excellent portrayal and can see elements of their own family members, while others claim the film doesnt go as in depth as they might have wished. I think that as someone who has not experienced Alzheimers to date, it was good portrayal for a general audience who may not have expieriance with the disease. One could charitably say that the film makers were not looking to give a paint by numbers portrait of the disease since no person has the exact same expieriance, but you guys watch and make the call.

A very moving picture that had me tearing up.",1461715200,,1258,4.713636363636364

6988208,5,B00SJC9WV4,"I read the book before I saw the movie, and yet, I was still able to enjoy the movie tremendously.  Julianne Moore definitely deserved the best actress award for this sensitive and compelling movie.  For me, the big surprise in the movie was Kristin Stewart and what a very fine actress she is.  Before seeing Still Alice, I was unfamiliar with Stewart but now am becoming a big fan of her work.  She played her part as Julianne's Moore's daughter brilliantly.  My mother suffered from early onset dementia, and this movie was emotionally devastating, uplifting, riveting, painful and soothing to me all at different turns.  I enjoyed it on many different levels.  Definitely, it is a five star movie.",1457222400,,701,4.840336134453781

6988214,4,B00SJC9WV4,"The movie was great.  The acting, it's easy to see how Julianne Moore won an Oscar for her performance, Alec Baldwin was awesome as well.
The one thing that was confusing about the movie, and the reason for a 4 star rating and not 5 stars was this.  The timeline of the move was hard to follow.  One scene she's 40, 2 min later she's 50 with no meaningful indication that 10 years has passed.  I'm sure if you read the book before the movie it was not an issue, but if you've not seen the movie it was confusing.

In January I go to the hospital in the city for 2 days of extensive testing. I never knew Alzheimer's could occur before 75 or so. And I believe a lot of people are under the same impression. With so many pharmaceutical commercials on TV, I believe they should make a Public Service Announcement about this. I heard a new drug is on the market for those that are diagnosed in the very early stages.

Alzheimer's is a really frightening disease, and Still Alice does a great job of bringing its life-altering consequences out in an extraordinary way. Julianne Moore is on top of her game as Alice, who struggles every day with this disease that is slowly stealing her most precious memories. Alec Baldwin is great as her devoted husband, John. He is in great denial at first, but loves his Ali in spite of her illness. Kristen Stewart made me a believer with her honest and sensitive take on youngest daughter, Lydia. Kate Bosworth offered a great take on oldest daughter, Anna, as well. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I will say this: Still Alice is an unflinching take on the devastation this disease can bring to a person as well as to his or her family.

6988314,3,B00SJC9WV4,"It could've been a contender. How? By taking away the family wealth. The family portrayed in ""Still Alice"" lives an elite Manhattan lifestyle, giving them the resources to have a live-in caretaker for Alice and potentially the ability to put her in a top flight nursing home. Reality for most others is different, and if you haven't experienced a loved one who deteriorates with any form of dementia then you may come away from this movie with an unrealistic perception.

Why attack the realism of a movie that's not a documentary? Because there are times when the script plays like an after-school special, where certain facts are placed in order to educate the viewer. Take away the family's status and you've got some realism to work with those facts. Instead of the possibility of a high-end nursing home, Alice would be placed in the type of facility all too common in regular America: the nursing home that reeks of human waste, where underpaid/under-trained staff are outmatched against the patient population, where abuse is rampant and prescriptions are regularly mixed up or not given at all. New fissures develop and old ones crack wider in the family due to the stress of having to completely change their lives to care for their relative leading to severe conflicts. These things are only hinted at here in Still Alice. That's why I've given it 3 stars - at least they attempt to show this, even though it's highly glossed to the point if you haven't experienced something like this you'll likely miss it. At least it's better than the horrible Notebook, another major movie release attempting to address the effects of Alzheimer's but which is pure fantasy drivel.",1447804800,,1678,4.887719298245614

But the story is far too melodramatic for such as serious subject.  I questions the casting of Alec Baldwin as the husband  He has made such a career as playing the cad (and he is very convincing at it) that it was hard to take him seriously as the supportive husband in this role.  Also, the other characters, her family, are superficially  developed except for her youngest daughter who is so self absorbed that it is hard to empathize with her.  The tinkling piano and emotive violin score seemed to be a bit trite and tended to trivialize the real tragedy that the story was trying to portray.  Finally, why does Hollywood always insist on using the upper middle class as the basis for telling their stories?  All the characters are professors and intellectuals and live in beautiful homes.  I realize the movie was based on a memoir of an upper middle class woman but why can't Hollywood tell a story about a tragedy with a working class or poor family?  I doubt if a poor family would have gotten the same kind of medical care that Julianne Moore's character got.  It would have added much more to the tragedy that the movie was trying to portray.",1446249600,,1325,4.470833333333333

6988370,2,B00SJC9WV4,I hate when there is no ending to a movie.  You watch a movie and it just endsa.  What the hell.,1445126400,,96,3.5238095238095237
6988371,5,B00SJC9WV4,Very candid.,1445040000,,12,5.5
6988372,5,B00SJC9WV4,"To be honest before watching Still Alice, I didn't really know how much of a problem Alzheimer's Disease really was.  Obviously it's horrible when your memory slips and continues to sink lower and lower to the point you're repeating the same questions you asked just a few seconds earlier to your friends and loved ones, and obviously it's devastating when this disease effects the entire family after many years/decades of memories have been stored only to gradually forget it all.  I actually think Alzheimer's might be more devastating to the family than those suffering from it.  A daughter or son in particular seeing their mother or father forgetting who their own children are is immediate tears, anger and worry.

Either way Still Alice is a really moving movie.  The way we see Julianne Moore go from being a college professor with tons of knowledge in her head to gradually succumbing to Alzheimer's after tests reveal she has the disease is really painful to watch and yet accurately portrayed.  I don't think a movie concerning the subject in such careful well-paced detail has been done before, but I could be wrong.  I now realize why so much attention has been given to this film.  The subject matter is hard to watch, but a movie like this needed to be done given the increase in Alzheimer's victims around the world.

Normally I can't stand Alec Baldwin but he plays a pretty good husband here (thought honestly there's several other actors who could have done the part just as well if not better) but I can't think of a better person to play the role of an Alzheimer's patient than Julianne Moore.  I mean were you watching her face and mannerisms as the movie went along?  She first appears very healthy and normal with moments of forgetfulness while keeping herself active with work and family, only for her face to gradually turn pale and show more fearful emotion as the disease begins to take a toll on her mental state.  The memory loss gradually overwhelms as Julianne tries her hardest to live life taking care of her family normally the way she always has but finding it increasingly harder now.  You can visibly see the signs getting worse and even though Still Alice is just a movie and Julianne is only acting, it's a little *too* believable at times.

It has to be just devastating for a child to ask a question or bring up a certain memory only for his or her parent to not remember.  Even though it was one of the parents favorite memories- just like that it's gone.  But apparently the memory could return again in the future depending on the severity of the disease a person is going through.  I'm guessing it's only a matter of time until the memory slips away completely though (then again I think most of us will eventually have memory problems at some point anyway).  At least it appears that victims suffering from the disease will remember again if they're having a good day.  This movie touches upon this type of forgetfulness but not as extreme as you'd imagine.  Usually whenever Julianne communicates with her daughters she's still able to remember things while only occasionally forgetting (minor things), but when it comes to her husband... that's when the symptoms get a lot worse.  I won't spoil them but they ARE the hardest moments to watch.  But if I recall Julianne never says to her children ""Who are you?""

Also a nice touch that her kids get tested for brain activity to see if they have Alzheimer's that will reveal itself one day.  I got sick to my stomach when the doctor said ""100% sure they'll get it""  if they test positive.  It's one of those situations where you want to strangle the doctor and believe he's wrong.  I honestly didn't realize early testing could be done.  I figured there was no way to tell if a person has the disease until a person reaches a certain age, then gets an MRI.  Unfortunately for the sake of this movie, her one daughter has the disease which makes Julianne feel tremendous guilt.

This movie's honestly really tough to watch.  I'm going to be perfectly honesty with you- if you have a family member with Alzheimer's, this movie is going to effect you emotionally and deeply, and I recommend for those with family members who have the disease NOT to watch it.  Those with a curiosity concerning Alzheimer's so we can see what it's like for people who have it, this is a reminder that yet another disease out there totally stinks and can ruin lives.  Hard to watch, but extraordinary from an acting perspective.  A slow-moving storyline that *has* to be slow so one can fully grasp the significance of the disease.  Recommended for those who can handle it.",1445040000,,4649,4.669533169533169

6988425,3,B00SJC9WV4,"With 64% Five star ratings and an Oscar win, I was expecting a whole lot more. I found the film rather boring actually. It felt like the writers and director think the viewers are morons. They gave the most surface treatment to the characters and the disease. It was like, if we didn't see Alice forgetting things, we wouldn't know it was a bad day or that she had Alzheimer's.

Stewart's acting was appallingly bad as usual. Baldwin is good in a few things, but this was not the right role for him. He wasn't horrible, but he wasn't great either. Moore just didn't have enough to do.

I found the ending abrupt and without closure. I felt like, ""so what"" at the end. The movie just didn't make me care and I wanted to care.",1442707200,,724,4.3161764705882355

6988444,4,B00SJC9WV4,"A very unsettling movie, Julianne Moore was great, but Alec Baldwin was miscast as were her children and son-in-law. They didn't fit my idea of the characters, as I read the book prior to viewing the movie. For these reasons I knocked off one star, not because of the hopeless outcome and sad ending.  The writing and Julianne Moore's portrayal are superb (5-star).

This movie is not for everyone because of the nature of the illness and it's inevitable progression.  With Alzheimer's, you lose everything that defines you as the person you are. Most, linger too long in a ""never-never land"" before death mercifully and finally unburdening the family of what must be an overwhelming task.  When Alice was still fairly lucid, she says that it would be much better to be diagnosed with cancer than have Alzheimer's. I'm sure a thought shared and echoed by many afflicted with this illness.  The title of this story could have easily be called ""Lost Forever.""

I can only hope that more money and researchers are poured into researching the cause and a cure (or at least a way to stop the progression) of this devastating brain deterioration.",1442102400,2,1140,4.82051282051282

6988469,4,B00SJC9WV4,"Still Alice is a flawed movie featuring a perfect performance from Julianne Moore, who not surprisingly won an Oscar for playing the role of Alice Howland, a 50-year-old linguistics professor at Columbia University. Happily married and well respected, Alice is at the top of her career when she receives a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

In Still Alice everything is seen and described from the viewpoint of the heroine Alice. This means that while Julianne Moores towering performance keeps fascinating us, we are not fully allowed to know in what way her husband John (Alec Baldwin) and three children Lydia (Kristen Stewart), Tom (Hunter Parrish) and Anna (Kate Bosworth) deal with the fact.

Perhaps this is how things are described in Lisa Genovas original book (which I haven't read) and the movie is only trying to follow that. Even so, I regret that the filmmakers have missed the dramatic potential of the situation. Among Alices family members, only Kristen Stewarts character is fleshed-out enough to be interesting.

Of course, this is not to say that Still Alice is a failure. With Moores riveting acting, it is far from that, and its simple narrative form is effective in the first half of the film where Alice gradually realizes what is happening to her. Still Alice is a quietly poignant film well worth watching, but you may feel there is something missing in the portrait of Alice.",1441584000,,1414,5.008510638297873

So well done - the struggle of the husband you related to in one scene and then hate him in the next.  The absolute and paralyzing fear of the wife and of course the different ways in which the kids react.

Julianne Moore is a fine, versatile actress who gave an excellent, believable performance of an intelligent woman grappling with early-onset Alzheimers. Good cast al around. As noted in the movie and paraphrased here, highly intelligent people often find ways of coping with decline, mental and physical, that can make the disease hard to notice at first. The movie is a glimpse into that world and gives us a bit more understanding, and knowledge and compassion are always a good thing.",1439856000,,617,5.049019607843137

6988599,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Amazing.  I've always liked Julianne Moore as an actress.  She always manages to take what she's given and elevate it beyond what you'd think possible.  With this screenplay, she was given pure gold to begin with.  What she transmutes it into is just beyond words.  This is a touching, aching, lovely portrait of what it is to lose yourself -- and what one might hold onto despite that terrible inevitability -- that never once strays into melodramatic or over-sentimental territory.  I don't think it's possible to watch this and not be moved.  It speaks to all of us: those of us with parents, those with children, those with loved ones of any sort; those of us who are afraid of aging, afraid of dying, afraid of fates that might be worse than death.

The final scene, which I won't spoil, is one of the most beautiful, poignant moments ever filmed.  I don't cry often in movies, but I was surprised to find myself sobbing when this one was over -- maybe because that last scene spoke so deeply and earnestly to my own connection to my parents.

6988729,5,B00SJC9WV4,"There's not much else I can say that all of the other positive reviewers haven't already said. But since I too lost a loved one to Alzheimer's, and am extremely fearful of eventually being diagnosed myself, this movie was deeply moving as well as somewhat educational - especially to those who may not have been exposed to this disease's detrimental effects. There are no happy endings here, just the stark reality that Alzheimer's, a highly disregarded disease (albeit with growing publicity), is one of the cruelest ways to die. And with my loved one, she did not have the rare, rapidly progressing, early onset form (as was portrayed in this movie) - she had the form that slowly takes your loved one away from you.

But that's not really telling you about the movie. I just finished watching it, and frankly I cried through the entire thing. Not just because it's definitely a sad film, but because of the warm moments, and other true-to-life idiosyncrasies of day to day existence that we can all relate to being acted out beautifully. This movie didn't stave off any fears I may have as a 48 year old woman who is losing her ability to spell and has always had what I consider to be pretty significant memory loss that keeps getting worse. So if you too have this fear, you will either become more fearful, or you will appreciate the frank portrayal of your possible future. I have to admit, it also gave me a few ideas on how to prepare and help myself with the use of modern technology if it does happen to me.

In short - I highly recommend this movie. I'm not someone that splits hairs over little things like filmography or whatever (and I usually don't even recognize those types of flaws). It seemed well-done to me, your typical movie-watcher. But in my opinion a good movie takes me out of my life for 2 hours and puts me into the lives being portrayed. This movie succeeded famously in that regard.",1438905600,,1914,4.561046511627907

6988732,5,B00SJC9WV4,This movie was a great example of people and their families living with Alzheimer's disease.  It was thought provoking and heart breaking.  I found myself thinking about this movie several days after watching it.  Worth the rent.,1438819200,,229,5.135135135135135
6988753,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Julianne Moore was exceptional in this film. Her portrayal of Alice's struggle with losing herself to Alhzeimers was so accurate and touching it brought tears to my eyes on several occasions as I related to the fear and desperation of having no control over what this disease stole from her. Julianne played the part so believably, you could see disease progress through her face and body language as the film progressed. She honored the struggle of living with Alzheimer's and allowed the audience to feel the loss she was going through which is a perspective that not many of us see. We see the other side, the side of family losing someone we love, but I really related to Alice while I was engrossed in the film. I actually watched the movie twice and recommended it a few friends whose lives have also been touched by Alzheimer's.",1438819200,,835,4.687074829931973

6988805,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Alice Howland has everything that most successful women do. She is a world-renowned professor linguistics from Columbia University. She has a wonderful family by having a great husband Dr. John Howland,who also happens to be a professors at Columbia and three grown children,all of whom have successful careers with one as a doctor,another as a lawyer and the other as a thespian. But things begin change when she later was found to have symptoms of the Alzheimer's Disease. She and her family are thoroughly tested and find a lot of pain in the situation. She then finds herself retiring early from Columbia and the on-set of her disease is seen as the story of the movie progresses.

Julianne Moore definitely provides a career performance as Alice. We see her transformation as realistically as possible from being a professor until the late stages of her disease. While the screenplay focuses more on the situation that she is facing,she manages to cover that flaw of the film by allowing the viewer to focus and empathize on her character as the story progresses. We see how she loses herself as she suffers from cognitive and memory impairment painfully. In the end,we also feel happy for her in the sense that this allowed her to somehow repair her relationship with her youngest daughter who happens to be a thespian as she decides to take care of her in the end despite not knowing much about it.",1438387200,,1405,4.805785123966942

6988843,4,B00SJC9WV4,"I'll preface my review by stating I worked for about 20 years as a registered nurse, in programs that cared for senior individuals, many of whom suffered various forms of dementias. I also read the book Still Alice, and found it to be one of the most remarkable works of fiction I'd ever read. While the movie does not quite live up to that standard, I still did like it, and view it as worth the time to see it. I liked the fact it did not dwell on the more painful aspects of losing one's capabilities, without knowledge of why confusion and deficits are occurring. The character Alice went to a neurologist early in her illness and received a credible diagnosis. I thought the story did not dwell quite specifically enough on what it was that Alice was experiencing, but on the whole, it was one of the best portrayals I've seen on the topic. In terms of entertainment value? I'd not recommend this movie for entertainment. It is too sobering to view what could be a documentary of how dementia progresses.",1438214400,3,1009,4.51912568306011

As we age, we don't want to accept memory lapses but they are a very real part of life. In Alice's case she too young to be dealing with early onset Alzheimer's and we get a chance to see how she deals with it. Alice,is a very intelligent woman beyond the norm.

6989116,5,B00SJC9WV4,"When someone decides to take on a topic such as Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's, etc... they run the risk of producing cheap emotions. Obviously loss is sad, and the people that go are not always the ones that should. A movie can harness the death factor easily.

Luckily, ""Still Alice"" does not. I would never have watched this movie had I not been assigned it for a class, but I am so glad I did. There is this feeling of neutrality throughout the beginning of the film that leads into the conflict with Alzheimer's so well. All of the characters are completely normal. They do not break the mold in any serious way. Intelligent and ambitious Alice and her husband, the daughter who mimics her mother, the loving son, and the rebel. The thing is, this is how it should be! This is how life really is. People don't all have crazy emotional scars and even the ones that do still end up being pretty normal (As normal as people get at least). The only way to articulate it is that this is as close to the real thing as you are going to get. The movie has some dramatized moments, but honestly this feels like how a loving family would truly handle the onset of Alzheimer's in one of the family members. Not everyone can care for Alice all of the time, and it is hard for someone to want to quit their job and everything that they worked for in life to stay at home with someone who only resembles the one they loved. When Alec Baldwin starts to cry at the end it broke my heart. How can one choose between staying with a lost cause that you love or moving on to accomplish your dream? Absolutely heart-wrenching.

This is a great piece and I hope that you take a chance on it and watch it.",1437264000,,1689,4.3081761006289305

6989138,5,B00SJC9WV4,"This movie is about a woman who is diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's. It is heartbreaking to watch her decline so quickly. But that is true to the condition. It wasn't sugar coated. Alex Baldwin and Julianne Moore are at the top of their game. Alex Baldwin's character tries at first to minimize his wife's problems. The most telling moment comes early on when Alice is just beginning to forget words. Her husband explains that it happens as you get older. She gets very upset and says that it isn't that. She knows what that feels like this is different. It's like the words have fallen out of her head.
Her husband and kids try to help her and make this easier but they can do just so much. This is a road she must travel alone. I became so invested in Alice and her journey I cried through most of it. This is the kind of movie Hollywood should make more often.",1437177600,,869,4.337423312883436

6989303,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Julianne Moore was brilliant in this story about what happens to individuals and their families when someone gets early onset alzheimer's disease.  Julianne Moore is a university professor and slowly starts to lose her memory.  The fright, confusion, denial, misunderstanding, and lack of acceptance of the diagnosis by family members is all here.  I won't say more than that about the storyline as I hate to read reviews where everything is given away.  I like to be somewhat surprised and able to connect with the story, and that can't be done if you know everything that's going to happen. There are good performances across the board, but no one came close to touching Julianne's beautiful portrayal of this attracting and attractive character.  She's strong and at the same time vulnerable.  She's independent and is a person who can completely take care of herself.  As these abilities start to recede, our emotions, care and concern, wanting to fix the problem, sympathy, and fear, stay with Julianne throughout the movie.  And what a radiant smile.  She's always been exceptionally beautiful in real life, but when she smiles, whether in real life, or on screen, you are mesmerized by her beauty and syncerity.  Without Julianne leading the way, this would have been an average movie.  She was truly worthy of the Academy Award with her gripping, heartfelt performance.",1436745600,,1377,5.075555555555556
6989304,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Amazing performance by Julianne Moore and Kristen Stewart and all. This story is of the disease we all fear, some of us more than anything, even cancer.

Yet this direct approach to Alices story is totally heartbreaking.  I felt the shock and humility of losing ones cognitive facilities, as well as the struggle of her husband and three offspring in adjusting to what comes as an unbelievable happening to their brilliant wife and mother.  Most touching is the sequence when Alice, now almost infantilised, comes upon a video message she made to herself while in the early stages of Alzheimers.

6989387,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Proffesor 'Alice Howland' (Julianne Moore) is a College lecturer in her specialised field of 'Linguistics' at just 50 years of age
begins to realize she is forgetting what should be simple things both at home and at work.
She consults a 'Neurologist' who after a series of tests, he tells her that the diagnosis though unusual for her age is that she
has the early onset of 'Alzheimer's Disease'....devastating news that she will have to share with her husband and three now
grown up children.
As things become more difficult 'Alice' makes a determination to enjoy her time with her family while she can still remember
the pleasure of doing so.....her World, it seems, far too quickly begins to fall apart.
A stunning performance from 'Julianne Moore' worthy of the acclaim received.
Among the supporting cast 'Alec Baldwin' as husband 'John' - 'Kristen Stewart' as daughter 'Lydia' - 'Kate Bosworth' as daughter
'Anna' - 'Hunter Parrish' as son 'Tom'  and  'Stephen Kunken'  as  'Dr Benjamin' (Neurologist)
Thoughts -
Few truly understand the condition unless faced with it with perhaps a close friend or indeed a family member, perhaps a parent
that had brought you up, taught you and now sadly does not always recognise you now, they may forget where they are, forget
simple things, imagine things that are not really there......the list goes on.
'Alzheimer's' is an evil illness that takes away the person they once were......obviously it is also devastating for those that watch on
helplessly.
I believe, as i'm sure many, many also do, that every Country that can, should invest whatever it takes to eradicate this frightening
condition.

6989405,2,B00SJC9WV4,"I loved the book. It was funny and sad and I was blown away at how the author was able to make me feel like I knew what this character was going through.  I recommended the book to everyone and I was so excited for the movie.  Unfortunately, I feel like it really did a disservice to the character. I think Julianne Moore was miscast (Apparently not a widely held belief as she won the Oscar for it, right?) as was Alec Baldwin.  I understand that the book was almost entirely in Alice's head - her thoughts, her confusion etc, and that is difficult to translate into a movie, but I feel like it could have been done better. It was a series of incidents with no real connection from one to the next. There was no real sense of how her thought process had changed.  I was really disappointed in this movie.

6989411,5,B00SJC9WV4,This was one of the most powerful movies i have ever watched. I was brought to tears so very many times. To bring this illness to the forefront is very needed. Julianne Moore did an exemplary job in her role as Alice,1436400000,,216,4.166666666666667
6989412,3,B00SJC9WV4,"The acting was really great; Julianne Moore certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar award she earned for this. I noticed Hollywood-like niceties like the setting being perfect, everybody being beautiful and the careers of the actors being a little too perfect, etc. Perhaps that was necessary for making a movie about this topic though. But, the movie did an excellent job of communicating the losses Alice and her family lived through. This is a serious topic and will be felt emotionally by viewers who have compassion and are especially emotional - it's NOT a feel-good movie. I have a progressive illness that is affecting me physically rather than cognitively and could particularly relate to becoming a shell of what she once was and her world drastically shrinking. For me it was a great tool for causing me to express my anger as well as the not great stress reaction I had. Beware if you're disabled! But, in real-life the perfect caretaker doesn't just show up never mind not devastate the family financially nor are clinical and diagnostic processes so cut and dried.

And forgetting isn't just about where the bathroom is and not recognizing people.  It's the loss of the simplest behaviors and reactions that come to the rest of us automatically--depth perception, a facial alertness, eyes that are constantly scanning and taking in the environment for information, a body that's alert and engaged in life.

Both films deal with mental decline and how it  affects the patients and their families but Amour depicts thousands of elderly people that endure the illness or fear will have to face it some day.",1436054400,,613,4.536363636363636

6989535,5,B00SJC9WV4,Still Alice deals with the challenges of Alzheimer's for both the person suffering from this disease as well as their caretakers.

Kristen Stewart appeared a little stiff.,1435449600,,347,5.444444444444445
6989536,3,B00SJC9WV4,"While Julianne Moore gives a wonderful performance, and even Kristen Stewart was pretty good, I found the movie to be so unrealistic that I had a hard time empathizing with Moore's character.  While I was sympathetic to Alice, I couldn't help but wonder what a divorced dad with no kids living nearby and a middle income job would have gone through. No support system, no money for caregivers, no income once he can't work anymore. It's as though the movie was showing what Alzheimer's was like when it hit the absolute idealistic white, upper class, married with 2.5 kids family. And she has the rarest form of Alzheimer's. It's a movie about the 1% getting hit with the 1%.",1435363200,,675,4.6722689075630255

6989555,4,B00SJC9WV4,"It is certainly no surprise that Julianne Moore won the Oscar for this incredibly vivid, moving, well observed performance. Her acting alone makes the movie worth the watch. She's also surrounded by a number of strong performances, most notably Alec Baldwin who brings a specificity and honesty to his portrayal of her husband that adds a great deal of dimension to the film.

The screenplay itself veers between being very successful at times to being awkwardly clunky at others. Some of the expected moments that come with the territory of Alzheimer's are particularly well displayed, but the ultimate catharsis and emotional heft of a childhood backstory is, unfortunately, rather unconvincing and limp.

The same sort of mixed review can be given to the direction, which is serviceable, but stands in lucky company given the strength of the cast. All of which makes it sound like I am knocking the film more than I mean to. The film is primarily a small, intimate portrait, and having exceptional performance(s) at its center is enough for this film to be a worthwhile watch.",1435363200,,1079,4.988888888888889

What about the many people around the world who are diagnosed and don't have a luxurious beach house to run off too. Julianne Moore gave it her best shot, but the whole thing seemed like a race to the finish. Where was the story? And the ending! What was that? The first REAL moment in the movie is the final shot? So many important moments were either skipped or sped right past in this story.

Our main character in the movie was celebraing her 50 th birthday when she realizes something has gone. wrong. You feel her frustration,her horror, as lucid moments all too quckly and are gone again. My own mother had brain cancer and for her last two weeks, Julianne nailedit. My mom was 83 but still, it did help me understand what she went through.

6989645,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Sad and difficult to watch, but the acting is terrific...and more importantly it gives us a crystal clear picture of what it's like to be a victim of Alzheimer's.  When Julianne Moore says, ""I wish I had cancer"" (and then explains why), her feelings are perfectly understandable.
She's right.  If a disease such as cancer is destroying your body, your friends, family, employers - everyone - rallies around you, but if a disease such as Alzheimer's is destroying your brain, everyone runs away from you, you become a pariah.",1435190400,,524,4.876404494382022

This is that film  The subject matter is not pleasant, Alzheimer's Disease is an insidious, wrenching disease.  Julianne Moore's performance was transcendent.  Alec Baldwin, as Alice's husband John, being torn apart by his wife's illness, has never been better.  Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish and Kristen Stewart as Alice's kids are real, and engaging.  Kristen Stewart especially.  She never really has broken out of the whole ""Bella Swan"" character, but as Lydia, she tore up the screen.  She made me cry, as a daughter who truly only cares about her mother in the end.  The whole cast was just incredible, and the supporting characters, especially Stephen Kunken's turn as Dr. Benjamin were so believable and enriching.  There was never a moment of this movie where you are suddenly outside looking in.  As each turn happens, you feel as much a part of it as the characters on the screen.  Alice becomes a dear friend you have to watch go through the destruction of her memories, and her life as she (and we) know it.  Kudos to a brilliantly written script, and wonderful direction.

6989666,5,B00SJC9WV4,"This motion picture and Julianne Moore's performance was worth waiting for (rather than seeing it in a theater). I saw enough of the trailers plus her winning the Academy Award, that it was a must to see as soon as Amazon made it available.  Ms. Moore is one of those rare modern actresses who is so good at her craft, that I forgot that I was watching Julianne Moore, actress, but rather her character, Dr. Alice Howland, the esteemed linguistics professor and well known and respected expert in early cognitive thinking.  As she comments, she's been teaching all her life about the very thing that she is loosing.
The rest of the cast is very good and I always enjoyed the chemistry Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore from their days together on Tina Fey's ""Thirty Rock"".  The dialogue was excellent too and at one of her final public speeches, she was particularly poignant when she firmly says ""....I am not suffering.......I'm struggling...."" and that said it all when it comes to the heartbreaking Alzheimer's.  The camera panned the audience which held doctors and researchers as well as some fellow Alzheimer's sufferers.  The camera paused a little longer at an attractive middle-aged woman who I'm pretty sure was a consultant on the film as well as a Alzheimer's patient and may even have shared as similar background in teaching as Dr. Howland.
It was a sad film, no doubt, but such an important piece of work humanizing the horrors of Alzheimer's and Julianne Moore was such a humble and sincere advocate for more research into the disease.",1434931200,,1550,4.81203007518797

This is what movie making can be, this is what movie making should be and I wish there were more movies with adult themes.  Intelligent and thoughtful drama.

6989705,2,B00SJC9WV4,"I read the book and was captivated by Alice and her rapid decline into Alzheimer's disease. The setting of Boston and Harvard seemed a natural fit for Alice, a noted and well-respected psychologist. Her children and her husband were well developed, I had a good sense of all of them. I especially felt the caring of her younger daughter and the sometimes distance of Alice's husband. The movie, not so much. Changing Alice from a psychologist to a linguist and putting her in New York and a faculty person at Columbia was disorienting. Although Julianne Moore did a more than adequate acting job portraying Alice, her performance was at times wooden and not quite believable. Alec Baldwin, as her husband, was a non-starter. He seemed to lack any real sensitivity to Alice's disease. I would not recommend this movie, especially if you've read the book. I think you might be disappointed.",1434585600,,888,4.887417218543046

The problem is the screenplay not the actors, who deliver good performances. I can't give examples without spoilers so I'll just say in general that many key scenes were eliminated that should have stayed..  (Especially her mentoring of a student who continued to let her help guide his work on his thesis and didn't desert her) Instead a bunch of blah blah was added that didn't contribute a thing. And other scenes  were changed to no good effect. (The failed suicide attempt especially). In short I found it to be a mishmash and a terrible translation of a beautifully written story.

6989790,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Julianne Moore deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress for her extraordinary performance as a linguistics professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.  At age fifty, Professor Alice Howland should be at the peak of her powers.  She is a respected scholar who has written books and taught at Columbia University.  In addition, she is a devoted wife and mother. Alice's world comes crashing down when she starts forgetting things.  Her neurologist runs a series of tests, followed by a genetic screening that reveals a grim fact.  Alice has a rare form of the dreaded and debilitating disease that will rob her of cognition, her professional standing, and even her ability to think and communicate clearly.

""Still Alice"" directed and with a screenplay by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, is an ineffably sad film about love and loss.  Alice's husband, John, adores his wife but does not know how he will cope with losing her.  Their children, Anna, Tom, and Lydia, have lives of their own, but are supportive of their parents and grief-stricken when they learn about their mother's diagnosis. Although the script and acting are all fine, it is Moore's portrayal of a beautiful, vital, and brilliant woman brought low by Alzheimer's that is the film's centerpiece. Moore appears at times without makeup, staring at her haggard face in the mirror, suffering from bouts of insomnia, and trying to convince her boss that she can still teach. (No, you are not forgetting things.  In the book, Alice was a professor at Harvard.)

This moving and meaningful film breaks no new cinematic ground, but it is a vehicle for raising awareness about Alzheimer's, one of the top ten causes of death in our country and a source of untold agony for the caregivers who struggle to help their mothers, fathers, spouses, sisters, and brothers.  Anyone who sees ""Still Alice"" and remains unmoved has a hard heart indeed.  Kudos go to the directors, to Moore for a courageous and honest portrayal, and to Lisa Genova who wrote the excellent novel on which this movie is based.",1434240000,,2074,4.9797101449275365

6989844,5,B00SJC9WV4,"For a long time movie of the week features on TV dealt with every known disease possible, so much so that some called them disease of the week films instead of movie of the week. Most of them featured fairly uninteresting story telling with decent performances but none ever brought the depth of feeling to the chosen illness. Those times passed and on occasion movies focusing on very real diseases are released. Some are great films that tackle their topic head on with amazing performances. STILL ALICE is one of those movies.

Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) is a college professor in linguistics. Her husband John (Alex Baldwin) adores her, she has three grown children (Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish and Kristen Stewart) and her life seems perfect. Then one day she notices that shes been forgetting things. She finds herself in the middle of a lecture with no clue where she is in her speech. Most alarming she one day finds herself jogging on the campus where she teaches with no clue where she is.

Seeking help Alice visits a neurologists. The test results come back and she discovers she has a rare form of early onset Alzheimers disease. Hoping for the best she hesitates but late one night breaks the news to her husband. Its an emotional scene where he tries to rationalize things, to entertain the idea that perhaps its something else, but Alice breaks down with so much fear, anger and frustration that boil up so quickly it presents an honest moment in the character.

Worse yet is the discovery that this rare form of the disease not only affects her but can be hereditary as well. Alice and John bring their children together to inform them of the problem as well as the possibility that they too could have the disease. Each handles it differently, revealing the depth of their characters as well. Anna (Bosworth), the married career oriented of the group who has just found out she is pregnant displays the most fear. Tom (Parrish), a college student finishing up school, is in shock. And Lydia (Stewart) becomes the most sympathetic of the three.

Lydia is the odd man out of the three siblings. She has turned her back on academia in favor of pursuing her dream to be an actress. Early on we see mother and daughter sharing time together with mom wishing she would return to school. There is a distance between the two but they still love one another. As things begin to change with Alice though, it is Lydia who is the most perceptive member of the family, the one who recognizes things early on and deals with them rather than her own self interests. Dont get me wrong, the other two care and worry, but not to the extent that Lydia does.

As the movie progresses so does the effects of the disease. This is where Moore shines, delivering a performance that garnered her an Oscar win. She doesnt play the character for immediate sympathy but while watching you cant help but feel sympathetic. As Alices life slowly unravels it is seen in each moment that Moore slowly plays out her life and how the disease gets to her. There is no over the top moment in this performance. While sad, it is truly touching to watch.

For me the most mind blowing portion of the film is when Alice looks at John and tells him that she wishes she had cancer. When he tells her not to say that she explains that at least with cancer there is awareness, that people hold walks and wear ribbons to let others know. That struck me. It was a bold and true statement. There is more known about a number of diseases and yet this one may affect more of us than we realize. To think of what it must be like to see your mind disappearing right before your eyes, to be unable to speak clearly, to communicate or to understand the simplest thing is a terrifying concept. This film brings that to light in a way that is never boring or clich.
As I said, there have been disease of the week movies made in the past that brought awareness with them but did little more. They felt cold and clinical with performances that added nothing to the story. This film is much more than that. It ties in not just the disease itself but the way it takes hold of each member of this family as well as the woman at the focus of the tale. In so doing it touches on a deeper lever than most movies of this type do. So much so that my guess is once you see this film you will find yourself thinking much more about Alzheimers than you did prior to watching. A movie that is a must see for all.",1433894400,,4466,4.4535452322738385

I was a little afraid to watch it because my mother has Alzheimer's (but not the early onset type).

6989881,5,B00SJC9WV4,"""Still Alice"" is an outstanding portrait of a smart woman dealing with a crisis that overtakes her and her family. Of course we would expect great performances from Julianne Moore and Alec Baldwin, but Kristen Stewart hits just the right note as a young woman trying to find herself and yet needing to help her mom.

Hollywood LOVES movies about families tearing each other apart, and then ""hugging it out"" in the last 10 minutes so that everyone leaves the Theater thinking ""maybe I can patch up my screwy family one of these days""?  Here, we see a view of what love and commitment might really look like, and how every powerful they can be.

This movie is ""best in class"" and while you may cry a few tears (justifiably), you may also be heartened by what you see.",1433894400,,765,4.489208633093525

As a retired nurse I promise you that it was much easier to watch a person have a parent or family member die suddenly than to watch the family go through the agony of seeing a piece of their loved one die daily as they struggled to keep their dignity.

Julianne Moore is transcendent...the whole cast delivers an integrated, deeply-connected performance which humanizes.  Don't shy away thinking this will be a depressing film....it is not.

6990060,4,B00SJC9WV4,"I like many people can related to this movie as I am not sure there are many families that haven't been touched by this dreaded disease, Alzheimers.

Julianne Moores portrayal into a slow decline was brilliantly played and really is the total focus of the movie with the other co-stars playing really marginal roles.  In reality they didn't have to play a major role as Moores graceful depiction really didn't need it.  The story is a bit slow at times but really I think is intentional to show the decline in mental ability that people suffer through.  This is a rather intense heavy movie that leaves you a bit sad at the end but like the movie so eloquently displays is that even in the end when there is nothing else, you always have hope.

6990133,3,B00SJC9WV4,"The real depredations of Alzheimer's disease and its toll on the families of the afflicted are not on display in the flawed drama.

""Iris,"" the 2001 film that starred Judi Dench as British novelist Iris Murdoch, was particularly frank about the effects of the illness, both mental and physical. It also highlighted the special tragedy when someone who has built a career as a communicator falls prey to the affliction.

""Still Alice"" should, by contrast, carry the label ""Sanitized for your protection."" Everyone involved is highly attractive, articulate, compassionate and virtually devoid of any flaws that would mark them as human.

What's left is a sensitive and appealing performance by Moore as Alice's mind fades from early onset Alzheimer's; her character has just turned 50. As for the rest of the story, adapted by directors and co-writers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland from Lisa Genova's 2007 novel, it has plot holes large enough to accommodate a Mack truck.

Quite sensibly, for instance, Alice's three children undergo genetic testing. Daughter Anna tests positive. That turn in the drama leads -- nowhere.

Another daughter, seems to be making bad choices both in her romantic life and as a budding stage actress. What happens next? We're not told.

Husband John bears every crisis with a preternatural calm, even when he's planning to pull up stakes from New York and move to a job at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic. Surely he must have strong emotions about his wife's illness. But, if so, they're never shown.

Having always been defined by her intellect and adept use of language, Alice is sometimes reduced to making speeches about her frustration. ""Sometimes I can see the words hanging in front of me and I can't reach them, and I don't know what I'm going to lose next.""

She learns to get by using her cellphone as a reminder of tasks, and the online game ""Words With Friends"" to shore up her vocabulary.

Alice has also made a video giving her future self instructions on how to take her own life. Her eventual attempt to do so goes awry. Yet any moral or even dramatic ramifications from this line of conduct are ignored in the movie's final -- and perhaps most glaring -- default.",1433116800,4,2208,4.882352941176471

6990153,2,B00SJC9WV4,"I went into this film expecting so much more than what I got. For a film this serious, I found it shockingly lacking the depth needed to pull it off. The performances were top notch, but we never really got to know who these characters were to care about them. The scenes felt choppily spliced together to show what Alzheimer's Disease does to a person, but I found that it didn't delve deep enough to show the personal impact it has on the person affected with it as well as those around them.....It touched on it, yet barely scratched the surface.

I've seen Lifetime ""disease of the week"" films with more depth in character, story & development than I found in ""Still Alice"". Perhaps because this was a major motion picture and not a ""tv movie"", I had higher standards for it. Julianne Moore gave a very good performance with what she had to work with, and my 2 stars go solely to her.",1433030400,3,888,4.414634146341464

6990170,5,B00SJC9WV4,"I'll start out by stating that I have never been a big fan of Julianne Moore and Alec Baldwin carries personal and theatrical baggage that tends to color the roles he plays.  Nevertheless, this is a film worth seeing, not only for the quality of the performances which a good in the main and excellent for Julianne Moore specifically, but for the subject matter.  Kristen Stewart likewise stands out as the ""black sheep"" of the family who manages to find the courage to face her mother's condition and accept that the changes in her mother do not alter who she is and what she means to her.  We are sadly left with little insight into what the other characters are thinking as they are less fully developed in this telling of the story.  It is this untapped potential that remains to be explored...that awkward inner battle those close to a sufferer must confront.  The film touches on this great test of love, but leaves much yet to be discovered.",1433030400,,948,4.585798816568047

The characters were just not as authentic or deep as I expected based on reviews that I read.  Moore's performance was also not as exceptional as it was made out to be, with some saying it was the performance of a lifetime.  It was, however, a touching story and a good way to bring awareness to a devastating disease.

Having a mother who suffered from dementia the last 8 years of her life, I related well to Alice and the techniques her immediate family used to deal with the disease of Alzheimer's.

The day to day sruggles, the disease and its progression, and that it is not only about the patients of early on set Alzheimer's,  it is about their families suffering as well.

6990196,3,B00SJC9WV4,"This is a very light introduction to the tremendous devastation brought on by Alzheimer's dementia. While additional detail into the progression of the disease and the toll taken on the caregiver would have been more true to life, it probably would have caused the movie to suffer at the box office. As a professional Trainer, Consultant and Lecturer of dementia caregivers, I found the role of the husband (Alec Baldwin) very weak and definitely not representative of how most husbands totally immerse themselves in the care of their wives who have Alzheimer's. Additionally, the progression of Alzheimer's in real life is far worse than was played out. For a better, more complete understanding of Alzheimer's disease and how it also affects the caregiver.  I suggest you read Dr. Peter V. Rabin's book, ""The 36 Hour Day.""",1432944000,,824,5.0588235294117645

6990214,5,B00SJC9WV4,"After seeing this it is obvious that Julianne Moore's Oscar was so well deserved, she was just incredible in the part. Actually every actor did a tremendous job, they were all so real and showed the day to day struggles without displaying any overt attempts at sympathy. Had they shown even minute amounts of playing to emotion rather than to the circumstance then the movie would have felt contrived and pushy.  If any of the actors had  inadvertently shown elements of grief stricken caricatures, even if just for a moment,  then the whole movie would have crumbled. I honestly think that the greatness of this movie can be attributed mostly to the casting director and also of course to the cast. This movie was all about the acting.",1432944000,,736,4.734375

Though my mom suffered from dementia, she was always ""still Madeline"".  Her six children loved her dearly and we think of her every day.  My nephew and his wife recently welcomed a new baby girl, and they named her Madeline.  The circle of life.  Anyway, Still Alice is a fabulous film with a magnificent ensemble cast, headed by the always great, Julianne Moore.

6990378,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Julianne Moore did an excellent job educating the audience through portraying a woman with Alzheimers. The story is a unique Alzheimers educator as it tells us first hand what it is like to have Alzheimers verses a story about what is observed from knowing someone with Alzheimers. Her best scenes are those where she does not speak. Early on, she does not speak due to a pause to search for words she knows, but are just out of reach. Next, her non-verbal acting skills demonstrate an almost complete loss for comprehending what's going on around her. I give the movie a 5 star, and I would give the book a 5+ star as it has a more complete ending.",1432857600,,649,4.46218487394958

6990382,5,B00SJC9WV4,"This was a tough movie to watch, because who really WANTS to watch someone lose their mental acuity and slip into Alzheimer's?  (This is why I rented it v. purchasing it).  However, Julianne Moore's performance was riveting, and the movie was well done.  I loved the way the main character's physical flaw reveals the character flaws in her family, which is oh, so true of illness.  Alec Baldwin did a great job with his Type-A ""I'll-be-there-for-you-until-I-actually-won't-be"" husband, but the heartwarming relationship that develops between youngest daughter Lydia (Kristen Stewart), who always fell short of her mother's approval but is ultimately the only one who goes the distance in being there for her, is what made me cry.",1432857600,,730,5.213675213675214

6990385,2,B00SJC9WV4,"I think the movie should have delved more into the effects the disease has within the family.  I felt Alec Baldwin was miscasted as the husband.  It seem the director didn't or couldn't get any real reaction from him, so he just breezed through the part.  The movie seemed like its own trailer and lost the main content of the story.  Alzheimer's is a brutal disease which also involves its caregivers. I don't think they allowed Julianne Moore leeway to express the anger and frustration the patient has because they cannot communicate with loved ones.  All in all, the movie played it safe.  PBS had a special on Alzheimer's disease which followed a real family through the whole deterioration process and death of the patient.  Sorry, but I really can't recommend this picture.",1432857600,,780,4.819548872180451

6990440,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Ordinarily, I'm not a fan of weepy ""three-handkerchief"" movies.  There are literally hundreds of them to choose from (there's even a cable channel that specializes in them) & most of them follow a predictable formula that goes something like this:

1)  We meet ""the Victim"" - the person who will suffer from some terrible tragedy (such as cancer or some terminal illness).
2)  We also meet ""the VLS"" (the Virtuous & Long-suffering Spouse) - although it could also be a friend, parent, sibling or whatever.
3)  We learn that the VLS has some serious character flaw (a workaholic, an alcoholic, a serial adulterer or just plain disagreeable).
4)  We also meet other family members (friends, parents, siblings or whatever) who have problems of their own.
4)  When tragedy strikes, the characters go through various stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, etc.) but eventually the VLS and the rest of the family overcome their own shortcomings, learn to cope with the tragedy and accept what has happened.

At its core, ""Still Alice"" is one of hundreds of other movies just like it that follow the above formula pretty closely.  That would make this a difficult film to recommend were it not for Julianne Moore's powerful performance as Alice Howland.  Moore's work in this film is so strong that after a while you forget how formulaic the storyline is.  She won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as a renowned linguist and lecturer who (spoiler alert) comes down with early onset Alzheimer's.  Moore's Alice is - first and foremost - a very intelligent woman, just the kind of character that Hollywood rarely gets right.  Far too often, smart girls are portrayed to be arrogant, emotionally immature, or just plain evil.  But Moore and the makers of ""Still Alice"" don't fall into that trap.

Her Alice is not only brilliant, she's also likeable, beautiful, sexy and deeply in love with her family.  Although she has flaws of her own, she embodies so many of the things that we in the audience aspire to be that when she learns that a disease is beginning to eat away at her intellect, she's not the only one who is horrified - we are too.  Moore does a great job of letting us get to know her character before bad things start to happen her.  That way when they do happen, we feel like they're happening to somebody that we know.

It's a powerful film.  Even if you don't like tearjerkers, give this one a chance.",1432857600,2,2422,4.73508353221957

6990548,4,B00SJC9WV4,"I'm so happy Julianne Moore won an Oscar for ""Still Alice"". Her remarkable performance of a 50 year-old woman in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease is tragic and astounding. I haven't read the novel but I thought the movie was beautifully-written. I have one gripe though - I found the pacing of this drama to be rather slow which is the reason why I'm giving ""Still Alice"" 4 stars instead of 5. Julianne Moore has ALWAYS been a superb and gifted actress. And even though I haven't loved every movie she's ever done, she still manages to give a strong performance no matter what. She always gives it her all and I appreciate her dedication to the art of acting. She is fearless as Alice. She brings a quiet and yet strong subtlety to this role. I felt really connected to Alice's struggle with Alzheimer's disease. But the actress who REALLY surprised me was Kristen Stewart. She's a pretty girl but before ""Still Alice"" - I never thought she had much emotional depth or range. She's NOT a bad actress, she's just very reserved with her acting ability. But she is wonderful as Alice's youngest daughter, Lydia - a nave but promising theatre actress. And she has lovely/natural chemistry with Moore. This is a beautiful film. Give it a viewing or two.

6990572,5,B00SJC9WV4,"I almost dreaded watching this movie-my mother Phyllis died in 1983 at 60 years old, from early onset Alzheimer's. She was a vibrant, intelligent, tough woman (WWII Navy WAVE veteran), and loving and sweet. She could ""take"" my dad, and they were a modern, loving couple before she lost her mind. My dad and I watched her mind and body die slowly. She began to suffer in her early fifties. There was no home health in 1980, little understanding from neighbors and friends, or the medical community (my mother had shock therapy for depression during this period!). This slow death of my mom almost emotionally killed my dad, and ruined my young adulthood. I was 22 when she died, and I took care of her, alone as a teenager, while my dad worked. I know what this horrible disease looks like, up close, for days and years on end. My dad and I recovered; I have worked professionally in health care, often with Alzheimer's support groups. My dad founded many of these support groups in the Southwest. Some of the scars of this family experience still haunt me.

My other trepidation is that I have always loved Julianne Moore for many reasons. We are the same age, she is almost a symbol of the beautiful Scottish-American redhead for me. She is brilliant, compassionate, a great actress, and stunningly beautiful. In this film she just knocks it completely out of the park. I can tell she did her research about how Alzheimer's sufferers behave. She is perfect, and I could barely watch some scenes because it was so painful. She is just stunning in her beauty, hope, confusion, ugliness, disheveledness, and poignant grief. The film is actually very simple, a meditation on her experience. I wanted to be disappointed that her husband (Alec Baldwin is wonderful and subtle) didn't suffer more, that her family did handle this illness very well, unlike my family and so many desperate families I have worked with. But in 2015 there is much more understanding and professional help for families, although there is still no cure for Alzheimer's.  Some moments in the film are just perfect-her statement that she would rather have cancer-I have wished this for my own mother, so I could have communicated fully with my mom as she suffered. Alice's plan to kill herself; I predicted that this would fail, as short term memory in these persons just dissolves; tasks cannot be planned or completed. The cast is great, especially Kristen Stewart, and the film captures almost perfectly the agony of watching the mind and personality of a loved one simply dissolve. Of course, this makes me admire the amazing Julianne Moore even more completely. Her loving performance is just a gift to all of us.",1432512000,,2687,4.801295896328294
6990573,4,B00SJC9WV4,"The writers had no idea how to end this touching film.  It ends abruptly without the full story of her life even hinted to.  But other than that flaw, the movie is a beautiful, heart-wrenching exploration of a disease that affects way too many people in this world.  And we take it for granted,  But when it arrives in a family, EVERYTHING changes.  And these actors bring to life all of the grief, human weakness, and hopeless acts that erupt in the face of this disease.

Now, this movie depicts an affluent family dealing with this disease, which is not very realistic for half of America.  So, the characters have money to lose, vacations to take together, and other bull.  So this aspect of the setting makes Still Alice a weaker presentation of this disease's effects on a family than it could have been.  The true devastation of this disease is not felt when the family has an enormous cushion of cash to throw at it.

But the acting is top notch.  The characters are interesting and realistic.  Give it a watch.",1432512000,,1019,4.538461538461538

6990575,5,B00SJC9WV4,"A poignant and incredibly important film, ""Still Alice"" is the story of a woman's descent into the grip of Alzheimer's disease.  Julianne Moore's performance is so real and raw, you forget she's ""acting"" as you watch her gradually slip into an intellectual ""no man's land"" of forgotten names and places she built her life around.  The tale is gripping and makes you contemplate your own journey toward your ""end-of-life"" experience, whether or not that includes Alzheimer's, illness, or loneliness.  The film has a biting reality that may inspire any healthy 35-year old watching it get his affairs in order, write that will, speak frankly with children and family members.  Yet, the film, though a harsh reality check, also has a sense of beauty and simplicity about it.  There's no fussiness in the story-telling and the movie doesn't make any excuses for itself.

""Still Alice"" makes you appreciate your memory, your mind.  Every time you go to the mall and are able to remember an hour later where your car is parked is an absolute gift-- as Moore's performance will show you.  Remembering the date of your wedding anniversary and your own child's name is a blessing.  When the short term and long term memory goes-- all is lost.  What is life, if it isn't a book of beautiful memories?  Once the memories fall out of our minds, life is gone as we know it.

If you care nothing about the disease of Alzheimer's, watch the film for Moore's striking performance.  Also a bright light in the film is Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Alice's college-aged daughter.  Stewart's unusual acting style may not be liked by all, but her subtle performance here will draw you in.

The final scene between Stewart and Moore is the stuff of magic-- heartbreaking, brutal magic.",1432425600,6,1765,4.8561872909699
6990576,2,B00SJC9WV4,"Sorry, I thought Julianne Moore did a great job and her youngest daughter in their roles
 Alec Baldwin was ok, although sympathetic husband is a stretch for his limited acting skills. I felt they didn't give the best account of the impact of the disease from a supposed loving husband and wife. Also, what turned this from 3 to 4 stars to a 2 was that the ending should go down in history as one of the worst ever. It felt like I had another 3 chapters in a book and then I turn to a blank page. I understand Hollywood doesn't want to make people feel to uncomfortable but having had family die and watching this disease myself  it didn't relay the symptoms or the affect all around of this disease. Which I think fails in what may have been an attempt at allowing people to really empathize with people and what they go through. Money is needed for researching cures and if someone who's seen loved ones die wasn't particularly moved, I doubt others will be either. A lazy writer and director? A Hollywood Gloss Over?....Well, watch it if not just to see Julianne Moore's Performance, and after that you tell me....????!!!!",1432425600,3,1124,4.504901960784314

6990582,3,B00SJC9WV4,"I really wanted to like this film a lot more. I love Julianne Moore and she did a great job as Alice, but the movie is not very good.

I feel like there was so much missing from the story.  The only real character development was with Alice, but even that was somewhat superficial.  The movie failed to connect on a more emotional level, even though the story itself was tragic and there was clearly an attempt to show the devastating impacts of Alzheimer's disease.  There is one scene where Julianne Moore is brilliant, giving a speech to the Alzheimer's Association.  It's definitely a tear jerker moment, but that's the only point in the movie when I felt something other than boredom.

The end was abrupt, literally as though part of the pages had been torn out of a book. It just stopped. Maybe that was done to emphasize the way Alzheimer's takes away a person's entire being. You are there, but not.  Or, maybe they just forgot to add the rest of the film, I don't know.  Whatever the purpose for the abrupt ending, it didn't work.

Two funny moments...

Alice is playing Words with Friends on a plane. The next scene is her husband played by Alec Baldwin.

6990596,5,B00SJC9WV4,"This film was one amazing role for Julianne Moore. Her character a highly intelligent woman who teaches linguistics at Columbia University finds herself forgetting ""small things"" like losing her place during a lecture or forgetting what her husband tells her. Soon she is caught in the desperate and heartbreaking grip of early onset Alzheimer's disease. I felt her pain when she went for a jog and suddenly had no idea where she was even though she had followed the same route for years. She finds herself fighting the forgetfulness and the pain of not knowing who she is anymore. At one point she runs to get a sweater so she can jog with her husband and she forgets where the bathroom is in her own house. Her husband played by Alec Baldwin is loving, sympathetic and does his best to hide the pain that the love of his life is fading right in front of him. His wife starts to sleep more and is disheveled in her mind and appearance. I am not familiar personally with the torment of this hideous disease but Julianne Moore brought it to the the screen in an intense and profound way.

6990616,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Alice (Julianne Moore) is one of the top linguists in the world. She loves her career and her own intellect (in a nice way). In the first scene we are introduced to most of the characters except for her daughter Lydia (Kristen Stewart) who is an actress who has to pay money to have people watch her. Alice discovers she has a rare genetic form of Alzheimer, one that she can pass on to her three children. If they have the gene, it is a 100% chance they get it.

During the film we watch Alice struggle, degrade, and leave notes to herself, providing for an interest twist.

Julianne Moore won an Oscar for her performance. I definitely think Kristen Stewart does far better in a support role, than a lead. Alec Baldwin had relatively small role for the spouse. The family helps out in what amounts to a sad film about the end of life, although the film never enters the more difficult, end stages of Alzheimer. The film is secular. No one prays for help.

I couldn't hep think about another film, ""You're Not You"" with Hilary Swank that received less notice, about a dying ALS patient. I think if you enjoy one of these films you would enjoy the other.

A good lesson for anyone who wants to make suicide plans...don't wait. For all of Alice's planning ahead, there was a real moral dilemma posed for me: Was the past lucid Alice going to kill the childlike Alice who had no idea of the consequences of those actions?

Having lived through a family member who had Alzheimers, I can say without a doubt that this is a very glazed-over sugar coated version of what the disease is like. The thing I don't like about the book and the movie has mostly to do with the story itself, not the acting. It is anguish for family members to not be recognized anymore...the thing about the story is every family member seems to be just OK and la-te-da about it. In real life, it would be a lot harder and there would be a lot more issues than what's presented in this story. Overall, it's a good movie.",1431907200,,657,4.181102362204724

She was not the problem in this movie. There was so little character development in the beginning of the film that I didn't feel emotionally attached to the characters like I feel I should have. Alice finds out she has early onset Alzheimer's at the very beginning of the movie. Very, very little time was spent on allowing the audience to get to know her and appreciate her intelligence, her drive, her emotional depth. I feel like these things were told to me in the movie instead of them being shown. While I applaud Executive Producer Maria Shriver's willingness to take on a difficult topic, the would have been so much better if perhaps it had only been 20 minutes longer to allow us to get to know Alice, her husband and her children just a little better.",1431820800,,903,4.580246913580247

It seems like nothing bad can happen at Columbia, or the nice restaurants of NYC or Nantucket so that warmth helps a little with the devastation of the disease.

6990872,3,B00SJC9WV4,"Like many other reviewers I have experience with a family members with dementia and also have suffered multiple mild traumatic brain injuries (mtbi) myself. Alice's early symptoms were shockingly similar to my acute recovery from mtbi's. One family member had early onset Alzheimer's  while the other has elderly related dementia. The early onset is much more shocking and seems to progress far more quickly. Julianne Moore did a tremendous job as an individual experiencing and trying to manage this devastating disease. I felt that her part had depth and realism as did the part of her younger daughter. But the movie opens with this close-knit family and I expected to see myriad ways that they all experienced during the illness and how that interplayed between them as family members. There was hardly any of that. After about the first half hour, the son and oldest daughter were almost non existent in the film. The movie doesn't give you any sense as to why they just drop out of the story. So the viewer is left wondering if it's related to coping with disease or to life's business, or what? So their characters are not fleshed out at all. Spoiler alert - Alice's Alzheimer's is familial and one of these two have the gene. But that is never mentioned again. The husband is slightly aloof but attentive and I got the sense that he and Alice were such a high-powered couple that you couldn't relate to her decline. The ending was extremely abrupt and left me feeling unsatisfied. Perhaps that was intentional, there is no happy ending. But Alice was still living at home with a daughter and care-giver and then the movie just ended. Glad I watched it, but I was expecting a more fleshed-out story.",1431561600,5,1706,4.763513513513513

I am grateful that Julianne Moore received her Oscar for her performance as Alice, but am disappointed in the industry for slighting this film as something worthy to promote and give it merit because it is so important for us all to understand what the people who have this disease and their families face as they deal with family members who are slipping away.

Julianne Moore gives a devastating performance as Alice. A brilliant neuroscientist/professor at Columbia University.  She recognizes some changes in her cognition, forgetting where she is, memory loss, and seeks medical attention. She is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's,which has a genetic component. She and her husband, played by Alec Baldwin, do all the right things, and they schedule a dinner so that they can tell their three children about the diagnosis. And. So, it begins, gage long road to a mind dissembling.

Julianne Moore, is superb in her performance, subtle nuances so well done. Her decline in physical and emotional appeRance. She deserved the Academy Award. Kristin Stewart, who plays the black sheep daughter, refusing collepge to follow her dream as an actor. She recognizes what her mother is going through,and how this is changing the entire family dynamics. She and her perfect sister, played by Kate Bosworth, have always had an edge,sibling rivalry to the max.

Alzheimer's disease is at the fore, and though it may be discouraging and difficult to face, this film shows how to face this disease in one woman's journey. In this film, Alice uses her computer and her mobile devices, the technology of today to help her memory. It is an excellent show of what we can bring to our lives.  Well done.

6990886,4,B00SJC9WV4,"Outside of Julianne Moore giving a magnificent, quietly effective, Oscar Winning performance in the film version of Still Alice is the added contributing factor to the motion picture version's success that Directors Richard Glatzor and Wash Westmoreland have presented the increasingly rare celluloid adaption that respects the source material. Lisa Genovas novel of the same title was a beautiful, well-researched tale of Alice Howland, a fifty year old professor struggling with early on-set Alzheimers. Glatzor and Westmorelands adaption views family reactions, their changes in attitude toward Howland, their frustrations with her decline and her struggles through lifes tasks in her gradual decline through the eyes of its main character, the victim, with the same effortless. Both literary and film versions of Still Alice share triumph because we were there, easily putting ourselves in the shoes of the lead of its tale and felt her helplessness because we felt we knew the character so well and it makes its refusal to be overly-sentimental all the more authentic and powerful.

  Another shared attribute is the general chain of events of the book (such a simple thing but one far too many film-makers neglect as if it is superfluous) and this will assuredly please readers as well as those who go into the story cold. The story arc adds to the genuine nature of the tale. Its in the little details such as Alice going through a questionnaire on her phone to check her memory and incidents that showcase the disease taking flight (i.e. the frequent scenes of her running and the symbol of jogging her memory that was a gentle symbol in the book of her jogging her mind to remember) which less capable directors might have made a foot note in the film and not given it the proper attention it deserved, perhaps in the name of keeping of the on-screen chronicle springing forward, being it was such a large part of the book.

  As a film, Still Alice has appropriate cinematography, solid writing (to add further appeal it seems much of the dialogue was taken directly from the novel) and it handles material which couldve easily been transformed into a generic story by keeping its heart in check and not adding anything which would not ring true or become clich by adding extra drama or emotion which wouldve stilted the overall atmosphere. It also has a surprisingly good performance in Kirsten Stewart, as a hopeful actress who is also one of the daughters of Alice Howland, who embodies her character with nearly the same verve and spirit as it was penned in Genovas novel. What seems a bit out of place is Alec Baldwin, as Alices fellow professor husband (who works at the same college as Alice) who echoes somewhat his role in the book version but really seems to be Alec Baldwin playing Alec Baldwin in any other movie that he has been in. In hindsight, that could just be a testament to his recognizable star power and a reminder of how many films we have seen him in but it is a tiny flaw, but one that holds the motion picture version back nonetheless.

  The lingering pace is also kept here and it balances out the previously mentioned detraction. It adds a slice of life impression overall to what we witness in Still Alices brief 101 minutes. Actually, the movie couldve stood to be longer as it seems many of the scenes are like quick snap shots and I cant help but think this holds back the emotional impact behind its cinematic floodgates. We barely get any sense of what is going on before the camera clicks and we are on to the next scene. I know this was done in the name of keeping the pace going but with a story as ponderous, necessarily slow and cerebral as this one I cant help but think that Still Alice wouldve been much closer to a perfect rating if it wouldve expanded and inserted much of the details from the book it left in the creases of the pages.

  Holding as close to the volume as this work freely does it also contains the surreal, but problematic finale. For those who have not experienced both it is a bit confusing and unsure of itself, a muddled conclusion that may have meant to get us inside Alices mind one last time at the height of the disease overpowering her mind but it is a letdown here as it was in the book. It is as if Still Alice became fearful of its impact and decided to cower back into itself in the last few pages and also in its concluding minutes. Its a sore spot that dilutes an otherwise simple, brave tale that deserves to be told in both formats, in more ways and more often. As in the book, right when Still Alice is sprouting wings towards greatness it ducks down and rushes out of the theater. Regardless, Still Alice stands as a reverent, intelligent adaption of a tome where all the same words apply and though it is taken away from what it could be in the ending it is still a very good work and well-worth seeking out for its dedication to realism and the source material as well as the humble strength present in its story and the many layers beneath.",1431475200,3,5035,4.613407821229051

Certainly not in the case of Noah which I recently saw online.  Still Alice in book form was an excellent introduction to Early Onset Alzheimers and the movies script follows the book very well.  But Julianne Moore transports the viewer into the world of Alzheimers.  As you watch the movie you see the disease through both the eyes of Alice and the eyes of those she loves.

Seen through Alice's eyes, we follow her from the moment she is diagnosed, the disbelief and shock she feels and then must communicate to her husband and family. We are Alice as she experiences loosing words, coherent thought processes. Each episode in her life shortens on screen, a disrupted story line, as we see Alice try to understand her changing self. The humiliation of being unable to locate the bathroom in her home, the alienation of her husband and peers. Yet, Alice begins to sense a new joy of just living in the moment, a type of freedom from burdens we all carry.  Yes, Alice is still Alice.",1431043200,,773,4.676470588235294

6990983,3,B00SJC9WV4,"I was very impressed by the homework they did to get facts out about the Alzheimers tragedy that affects families.  And Julianne Moore portrayed it so well, and was rewarded for it.  As RN,  I did notice a clear problem with trying to compact this life's story into a couple of hours: Makeup and other things they did with the main character showed a progressive disease fairly, but a personal friend right now has the early onset disease.  She is a gorgeous woman like Moore, but the toll it took on her body and her face is undeniably tragic. Moore was still gorgeous at the very end. But of all problems I saw was that the family, though she wanted them to ""move on"", didn't show the degree of change that does happen. Husband, while still empathic, still handsome and virile, not tired, not sleepless, and moving on to Mayo Clinic.  The children showed no physical deterioration, or the writers really believe that early onset really moves that fast.  There is nothing rapid except the onset, and I thought the movie might have shown a little more overtly how long a period this deterioration took.  The subtle seasons etc were ok, but was that one year, two years?  Believe me, as a Registered Nurse, I have seen the physical and mental toll this disease takes on FAMILY members.  This family was so sophisticated that nothing really surprised them, and they were on top of everything.  I was just a tad disappointed in this movie and was terribly bothered that the release of it was so limited.  To get it on Amazon was ridiculous.",1430438400,8,1537,4.593406593406593
6990984,4,B00SJC9WV4,"A stunning and selfless performance by Julianne Moore, but a darkly magnetic one by Kristan Stewart, Brandoesque in its intensity.

To say this is a TOUGH movie to watch, would be candy coating it but the reward is that it's got so much soul and emotion and everyone in this piece is really on top of their game.  So, if you like terrific acting and a really good (albeit a tragic and moving) story, then this will be well worth your time.  It's the only movie I've ever had to stop myself from leaving on 3 different occasions, since it was so emotionally draining but I persevered and needless-to-say, me and the other two women at the theatre that day, left hardly in control of our emotions or our tears.

This however, is not the worst movie she has played in. I believe that she deserved every bit of the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance as dr. Alice Howland. I believe that this film tells us in a slow but interesting way the importance of Alzheimer's disease. Julianne Moore is very convincing with her character...
I did hate watching Alice slowly unravel, and the different ways that her family react to her Alzheimer's progression. It's definitely a moving moment when she delivers her speech to the Alzheimer Society. All around pretty good movie.",1430265600,,680,4.628099173553719

6990991,5,B00SJC9WV4,"The awareness of the tragedy of Alzheimer's disease grows each year, and the older we grow the more poignant this poorly understood malady becomes. This radiantly beautiful film STILL ALICE helps - it helps to fill in some of the clinical data, testing, rigors of diagnosing, and inadequacy of available `treatment': it also helps the audience witness how this disease not only encumbers the people around the victims who must alter their lifestyle to accommodate the increasing dependency on caregivers; but most important, it offers the view of the person with this progressive disease and the way the little things about living slip away insidiously.

Directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Washington adapted Lisa Genova's novel of the same name with tremendous sensitivity, sifting through Genova's copious medical data and taking just the right amount to make us understand what little is known about Alzheimer's without belaboring the technical aspects, leaving room for the actors to offer us the effects of the diagnosis rather than a docudrama of a disease.

One fine plot synopsis tells enough: `Alice Howland is a renowned linguistics professor happily married with three grown children. All that begins to change when she strangely starts to forget words and then more. When her doctor diagnoses her with Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, Alice and her family's lives face a harrowing challenge as this terminal degenerative neurological ailment slowly progresses to an inevitable conclusion they all dread. Along the way, Alice struggles to not only to fight the inner decay, but to make the most of her remaining time to find the love and peace to make simply living worthwhile.'

But it is the blazingly real performance by Julianne Moore that crowns this achievement. The supporting cast truly supports - Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Stephen Kunken, Hunter Parrish, Kate Bosworth, Quincy Tyler Bernstine especially. Profoundly moving, this is an important film on so many levels that it belongs in the DVD libraries of everyone who cares about variations of living and the circle of life. Highly Recommended.

6990992,5,B00SJC9WV4,"As everyone has pointed out already, Julianne Moore's performance is the best part of this movie.  However, there's so much more to admire.  Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart are great (yes, that Kristen Stewart), the chemistry between the family is great, and the screenplay is solid (except for the ending).  Go see this movie, it's well worth your time.  I know I'll be seeing it again.

The story is superbly acted by both Julianne Moore, who is a wonderful woman, and Kristen Stewart also dazzles as playing her daughter. This story was deeply affecting to me, having personally seen the harrowing way Alzheimer's disease takes over your mind and body. Its a disease that i wish we knew more about, it takes a bright mind and strips away everything, in Alice's case, rapidly. You will take away something from this story, i know i did, and it will probably leave you treasuring what you have just a little bit more. This movie is worth the watch and worth the tears. I recommend it to anyone!",1426723200,14,711,4.476923076923077
6990995,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Julianne Moore did a great job on this movie. No wonder she got Best Actress this recent Oscars. Her acting and portrayal is very raw and realistic. You can really see the fear in her eyes. The fear of losing, that is. The story itself is very heartwarming, touching and sad all at the same time. I was just shocked when it ended...I was like, ""Is That It?"" I thought she would go back to that video again of herself giving her instructions on how to commit suicide via sleeping pills. Oh well. It's a great movie nonetheless. Very fast-paced and interesting.",1426118400,2,559,4.490196078431373
6990996,4,B00SJC9WV4,"Julianne Moore gave a masterful performance in this role.  Her movements, facial expressions, and overall portrayal of a woman suffering with early onset Alzheimer's, and quick deterioration, gave a realistic portrait of the ravages of the disease.  Kristen Stewart gave a nuanced representation as Alice's youngest daughter.  Alec Baldwin was somewhat against type and at times a cold self centered husband.  He was wrapped up in his own life and concerned about his wife as a mere afterthought.  While not a widely detailed story, I was enthralled the whole time.  A criticism is that we didn't get much of the actual caregiver and family's perspective of the toll it was taking on them to handle Alice and her rapid decline.  Not much attention to that aspect of the story.  In summary, an unforgettable interpretation from Julianne Moore.",1426032000,,842,5.094890510948905
6990997,5,B00SJC9WV4,"From the novel by Lisa Genova and screenplay from Richard Glatzer, comes the story of Linguistics professor Dr. Alice Howland from Columbia University, New York. Not only does she love communication itself, she is also losing her ability to use it and quite rapidly. While she first suspects another illness as it is also profound, she comes to understand that it is actually Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. The form she is diagnosed with is rare and its symptoms ravage her cognizant mind quickly. She does say as she is giving an important speech at the Alzheimer's Convention later in the film that she is ""struggling"" and ""not suffering"". Alice fights to remain in control of her disease rather than allowing it to overwhelm her. She has begun losing her words, memories, and the things she could easily recall before while having trouble focusing. Even with such odds stacked against her at the initial phase of diagnosis, Alice still chooses to live each day to its fullest and take whatever comes as she takes the integral position of 'planning ahead' that many do not - or cannot - do. This is a phenomenal portrayal by Julianne Moore and she tackles this head on. Losing the very thing that drives her as it is all about language is absolutely devastating and she shows each emotion in her painful portrayal. Her refusal to give up is amazingly done and each and every horror is shown through Moore's actions but mainly through her eyes alone.

Alice (Julianne Moore) is celebrating being fifty years old at the time in the movie when  the symptoms begin to proliferate. She is trying to understand why these uncharacteristic things are happening. There are the three stages of dementia that a sufferer of the early-onset type goes through and the disease may be caught early because of the young age of the person with these former complaints. Though, on the other hand, Alzheimer's Disease is also uncommon at this age so other diagnoses may be given before discovering the true illness, such as stress-related disorders, a brain tumor, or even a hormonal reason. After Alice has been seeing a neurologist, she tells her husband, Dr. John Howland MD, (Alec Baldwin) what she suspects in a gut-wrenching scene. The suspicion has now become the reality. This is a horror story in real life. One that could happen and is absolutely frightening. Alice must inform her three grown children; Tom (Hunter Parrish), Anna (Kate Bosworth) and the wonderfully rebellious then soothing, Lydia (Kristen Stewart). This successfully functioning family is now faced with holding it all together while Alice fights this combatant of a major decline. I did hint at her speech at the Alzheimer's Convention, this part is when Alice gets to have her say. She talks of everything dear to her, what she has lost and what will never leave her. There is much for her to say about her family's love and care while the desperation seen in her eyes is alway directly at the surface and at the audience.

Directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland give this movie such poignant touches and plenty of room for the audience to feel right along with what Alice is feeling. Because the story is written from her point of view, she is easily able to command the audience right down to her facial gestures she is constantly adding. The small but equally huge ways Alice uses to leave around reminders for herself of different things for when she cannot remember them in the future is a true showing of planning ahead - pulling tremendous sympathy during a resonating scene in particular. Very nuanced and multilayered character portrayals were extremely appreciated and necessary for this great cast. Alec Baldwin's character as her husband going through this along with his wife was troubled and accepting in his own way. There is a great feeling of comfortability between this couple although something that Baldwin wishes to do with his own life may cause strife and further opportunities to progress in his own career causing what direction they have to take their marriage and children. A greatly appreciated and self-denying portrayal from Kristen Stewart, who is with her mother so much of the time and helps to render a truly believable daughter and mother bond which bestows a wonderful warmth.

""Who can take us seriously when we are so far from who we once were?"". When Alice begs an answer to this question at the convention, I could empathize immediately with the position she feels she is in. There are many other illnesses that can confuse or mimic a possible diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and especially at her younger age. Many others are struck down with varying illnesses that are quite like Alzheimer's Disease and the feeling that one has lost a huge part of themselves due to them. In these very real and finessed touches, ""Still Alice"" will stay with you far after you view it. There is a deep-seated sadness in real-life situations that cause degeneration of the mind and the memory including emotional pain in the person struggling with the illness. It is also overwhelming at times for the family of that person and each and every life it touches. In these very real and careful touches, ""Still Alice"" and Julianne Moore's heartbreaking portrayal will resonate with you far after you view it.",1425945600,15,5304,4.89

6990999,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Interesting subject matter and Julianne Moore's astounding, raw and believable performance in one picture. What's not to like?! The writer (of the novel and the screenplay both) has a very profound knowledge of Alzheimer's and I saw that albeit I don't have any reference except for Alllie in The Notebook. This movie shows how Alzheimer's can affect a diagnosed person without them even knowing it. This makes it more intense and hateful a disease as Alice, was a very successful person. It shows how anyone, no matter what race or status quo, can be diagnosed. I think this shows that all people are equal...watch it!",1425427200,3,619,4.904761904761905
6991000,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Absolutely brilliant performance by Julianne Moore as Alice, a highly intelligent linguistics teacher who finds herself diagnosed with familial early-onset Alzheimers.  This is an incredible movie, but definitely not one that is easy to watch.  We go with Alice as she finds her greatest asset, her mind and memory, being stripped away from her.  We see the difficulties her husband and children face as the woman they knew and loved becomes more and more confused and lost.  Im glad I saw this movie, but I doubt I could see it a second timeits just too real and too hard to watchbut it definitely made me much more aware of the pain and suffering of people who are going through what Alice in the movie was going through, and what their friends, family, and caregivers have to deal with.",1425254400,4,789,4.695652173913044

6991002,5,B00SJC9WV4,"I just saw this movie the night before Jullianne Moore won the Oscar for best actress. (Thank you to The Senator Theater in Baltimore for showing this film that isn't widely available everywhere!)

I didn't find the story to be overly compelling. But the acting was beyond superior! The Oscar was definitely well deserved. The other 4 nominees probably knew they didn't even have to bother preparing an acceptance speech.

Her acting alone made this movie well worth watching, regardless of the story. Having experienced Alzheimer's in my family, Moore's portrayal hit home. And while her performance isn't going to cure this disease, it was nice to watch the film and know that at least someone else out there understands how emotionally difficult it is to watch someone you love go through this. That meant a lot.

I feel like she also gave a voice to people afflicted with Alzheimer's. Often, the people suffering won't (or can't) speak up to talk about how they feel. So the stories you hear about Alzheimer's usually are about how the family of the afflicted feels. Moore gave those people a voice and gave insight into the other side of Alzheimer's....being the one who has it.

The best part about her portrayal was how she showed how strong an Alzheimer's patient can be, even if it's only internally. We tend to look at people with this disease as being helpless and lost. In reality they can be strong and determined, but unable to express that or act on it.

Watching this made me feel a little bit closer to my family member who suffered from this.

Again, this movie isn't about the story. It's value isn't in the plot. It's all about the portrayal of someone afflicted by a horrible disease. I know Moore's character focused on Early Onset Alzheimer's specifically, but her character was adaptable to the more common Alzheimer's patient who is of advanced age. The point about how difficult it is to be both a patient and a family member transfers to other variations of Alzheimer's very well, even if some of the specific medical details or life situations don't. That's what is important.",1424649600,8,2104,4.78236914600551
6991003,4,B00SJC9WV4,"Theatrical review. There are a couple reasons why this film hasn't been seen by most movie-goers. First, it didn't get much of a distribution and second, it deals with Alzheimer's disease. With Julianne Moore's recent and well-deserved Oscar win, I suspect more people will seek it out. And they should.

Moore plays a successful 50 year old linguistics professor at Columbia University in New York. Her husband John (Alec Baldwin), is a highly regarded medical doctor (research) and the couple has the perfect family. A son, Tom (Hunter Parrish from TV's ""Weeds"") is also a doctor, Anna (Kate Bosworth) is a lawyer, newly preggers and married to a perfect man. And then there is the renegade youngest daughter, Lydia (excellent Kristen Stewart) who has shunned college for an acting career in L. A. Oh, the horror.

I suspect this beautiful family portrait was no accident, setting up a life defining tragedy when Alice (Moore) begins to forget words and getting lost on campus. It turns out she has early onset Alzheimer's and it is a rare, quickly progressing form. Lydia returns to New York and the family circles the wagons, realizing everything is going to change quickly.

The scripting is fairly simple and therefore relies heavily on Moore's acting ability to transform Alice from a brilliant lecturer to someone lost in her own mind. It is an amazing performance as Alice maintains her grace as long as she can. She creates her own little mind games to judge her capabilities and even creates a video to guide herself when she no longer has control. It is devastating and emotionally heartbreaking. Still, I think the filmmakers, including the ALS stricken director, Richard Glatzer and his partner Wash Westmoreland, wanted to provide information to the audience more than they were interested in making us shed tears. I never felt manipulated by the story, although the musical score might suggest as much.

The key is Moore's ability to define Alice and her opportunity to control her destiny as long as she can. While the exchanges between her and her family are important, it is equally important to watch Moore as she moves about her routine in complete silence. It is a mesmerizing performance. The film was shot quickly and cheaply and sometimes it shows. But there is no taking away from the fine performances and the important message the film delivers.",1424649600,11,2373,4.954773869346734

6991005,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Julianne Moore has brought us countless interesting and complex performances over the years, some of my favorites being her roles in Boogie Nights and The Kids Are All Right (two drastically different movies). And she keeps with her now normal amount of excellence in her latest, Still Alice. Managing to prove yet again the wide extent of her acting ability, she takes on this challenging character with a huge amount of dedication and finesse. Heartbreaking and fascinating to watch, she brings many levels to Alices extremely difficult situation.

The situation Im talking about - as many of you know - is her being diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The film revolves around the deterioration of her memory, simultaneously showing her drive to keep her life together in every way possible. And despite what you might think, its a relatively slow process. Though she may receive the diagnosis in what feels like overnight, she gradually loses her mental functions over the course of a few years and cant properly think or do much for herself.

The picture ultimately rests on Moores shoulders and she handles it superbly. She may have help from a talented supporting cast including Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart, but their characters are never the absolute focus. It doesnt overwhelm the audience with her family members problems like so many other films centered around disease. It simply concentrates on Alice and her daily struggles instead of dwelling on how it affects those around her. That, above all, is one of the many reasons why I found the film so engaging. I had slight problems here and there - the biggest being with the fairly melodramatic ending - but overall I found the movie to be especially powerful. In fact, it almost brought me to tears about halfway through. When a movie can affect you that profoundly is when you know it has succeeded.",1424563200,6,1881,4.968253968253968

8698514,5,B00SJC9WV4,"Just saw the movie and read some of the critiques. Mostly critical of the plot, ending, and characters/too many unresolved issues left on the table not to mention that it doesn't follow the book close enough. Usually I am for following the book closely, but this movie did something that was so much more necessary and that the aforementioned critics seemed to not see.

[Spoiler Alert: several details ahead]
The plot had nothing to do with Alice-and-her-family. To be fair, the movie does leave a lot undeveloped and unsettled with the family. But it really wasn't about the family. They truly were the backdrop, landscape, props to a one woman performance as far as the plot goes (though acting well done none the less). The plot was about Alice-and-the-disease.  It was up to Moore to play out the entirety of that plot and she did an incredible job of it. Awards well deserved!

For those looking for the plot in a family going through the loss of a wife/mother to Alzheimer's, I would only say that this would be a ""B"" film with Baldwin doing a great job being a jerk and no resolution to family issues for such a plot.

But with the Alice-and-the-disease plot we see her struggling through her use of the phone as a coping tool throughout, the photographs that become movies, her runs, her career, and then we see a real climax of the plot come in her speech. That explained the whole conflict of one living ""on the inside of Alzheimer's"". That was the hero taking the mountain and storming the gates of the enemies prison and setting the captives free (if even for that fleeting moment).

For those who like movies to follow a plot with full resolution with all loose ends nicely tied up in the end, you may not like this--because REAL LIFE doesn't always get to have full resolution of issues and REAL LIFE doesn't get all loose ends tied up (or sometimes any).

You can only do so much in 100 minutes and clearly this was totally focused on what Alice was experiencing progressing from her first awareness of cognitive impairment till her true loss of cognitive connection to reality around her.  A noble task for an hour and a half and well done.

This movie should play an important roll in particularly families and caregivers educating themselves about Alzheimer's. There is a difficult road ahead and greater empathy will help sustain the compassion that calls one to care for one they love.",1533686400,,2406,4.658018867924528
