8695975,4,B00RVAB5PG,Lightweight farce set in a British health spa that has a pretty decent murder mystery that will keep you guessing at its center.  Good comic byplay between Terry-Thomas as a private investigator and Eric Sykes as the spa's demanding director.  Lionel Jeffries offers able support as the police inspector who's one conk to the head away from a concussion.  Mandy the dog steals virtually every scene she is in.  I wouldn't characterize this as classic British farce but its charms are abundant and a good watch on a rainy afternoon or if you live across the pond excellent bank holiday fare.,1431820800,2,590,4.811881188118812
8695976,4,B00RVAB5PG,"This is another classic Britcom filled with those wonderful, familiar character actors. The script's plot and dialogue are average at best, but the aura created by all these wonderful people populating them makes the modest time commitment worthwhile.  Terry Thomas' fabulous face and classic ""muddle through"" playing off Lionel Jeffreys' clueless cop is certainly worth the price of admission.  The set up reminded me of ""My Favorite Brunette"" with Terry Thomas portraying a photographer doubling as a private eye. Was this the best Britcom ever, well, no but it was fun and it rewards you with a surprise ending.",1425686400,4,614,5.191919191919192
