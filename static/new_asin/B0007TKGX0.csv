2241201,5,B0007TKGX0,"MY 3Y/O LEARNS SO MUCH FROM THESE DVD'S AND THEY ARE GREAT TO SIT WITH HIM AND MAKE IT INTO FAMILY ACTIVITIES. INSTEAD OF HIM JUST WATCHING SHOWS BY HIMSELF AND NOT REALLY LEARNING HOW TO USE IT IN REAL LIFE, WE TRY TO SHOW HIM HOW TO DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON THE DVD HERE AT HOME WITH HIS OWN TOYS/SUPPLIES.",1242604800,,308,3.9838709677419355
2241202,5,B0007TKGX0,Just like all the other Blue's DVD I have bought this one is also a good one. Just like the other I wish when you hit play all is would also play the bonus shows. My girls don't watch the whole DVD at once. When I shut it off and turn it back on it starts from where I shut it off. The Blues Biggest Stories is really great for that so I don't have to skip through all the stuff in the beginning each time I turn it on.,1231459200,3,419,3.6666666666666665
