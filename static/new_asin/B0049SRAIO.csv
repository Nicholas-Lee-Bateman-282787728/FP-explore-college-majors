8419272,5,B0049SRAIO,"I love this movie! Filmed in the beautiful town of Lavallette, it depicts the Jersey Shore as it should be (the complete opposite of the trashy MTV show ""Jersey Shore."") It's easy to relate to the main character Jenny - the girl has dreams and will stop at nothing to achieve them. A very cute coming of age story.",1422144000,,314,4.338983050847458

8419275,5,B0049SRAIO,"I saw this movie on SHOWTIME and was surprised how much I really enjoyed it.  The major characters were actors I was unfamiliar with and may very well be their first movie but each and every one did an excellent job!  It was very believable and genuine.  Also the story, plot and subplots were not the same old same old we keep getting offered from Hollywood so it was very interesting to watch; where is the story going???  Very interesting about seeing illegal immigrant employment from several viewpoints.  Each character was so likable and easy to relate to.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie - as much as the box office hits and the academy award winners!",1308355200,3,659,4.637931034482759
8419276,5,B0049SRAIO,"I have seen this charming movie on one of the premium channels in the United States. Why isn't it available for Region 1? It's a shame that we are blocked from buying a copy of the DVD.

The movie itself is a wonderful and heart-warming love story, but it goes beyond romance. A girl (Kim Shaw) who has lost her father finds a surrogate father (Paul Sorvino) at a resort on the Jersey shore. This man has ""lost"" his son due to his earlier lifestyle. He ends up caring for the girl as if she were his daughter. The story is utterly charming. There is just one thing that people might not like, all the cigarette smoking that goes on with the men who are also working at the same resort where the heroine acts as their English teacher, and where she also finds the young man who falls in love with her.

I'd love to see this movie again. But - alas! - it's not available in the United States yet. I hope this will be corrected in due course - the sooner, the better, as far as I am concerned.",1298419200,7,990,4.151041666666667
