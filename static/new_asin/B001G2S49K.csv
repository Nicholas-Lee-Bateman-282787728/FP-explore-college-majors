8303714,4,B001G2S49K,"Impressively thorough biography of Griffith, covering his whole working life in 3 parts that add up to 2.5 hours of material.

An excellent array of clips, stills, and talking head interviews with many who were there (a lot of the interviews were older, from earlier sources -- many of the people had probably passed by the time the documentary was made).  More scholarly than emotional, it's a bit limited a certain tendency to be repetitive, and a seemingly strong reluctance to fully examine the awful racism portrayed in The Birth of a Nation.  (Doubly odd in that many of Griffiths other pictures were very progressive socially, including the interracial romance of Broken Blossoms.  That complex duality is one of the more interesting aspects of the man's career.  Seems strange to step around it.).

Certainly a must see for anyone interested in the history of film, and its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.",1461715200,,920,5.019736842105263

8303716,5,B001G2S49K,"Most film documentaries feature film clips and interviews and this one follows the tradition. Just h-o-w Mr. Griffith created his masterpieces and interviews from those who knew and worked with him highlight this tribute. His rise, fall and legacy are documented with respect for the subject and what he left behind. Another fine portrait from Messrs. Brownlow and Gill, who have been of inestimable value in documenting the heritage of silent films.",1255305600,11,450,5.263888888888889
