8115193,5,B000EWQ0V2,"In 1990 Strand VCI Entertainment started releasing Thomas The Tank Engine in America, after Shining Time Station had aired them. One of the only two American VHS that had been released in broadcast order. Now from the Strand VCI and the Strand Home Video there is a difference with the narration but that's another story. This also is the other full RS US narration VHS that is still in production and has been released on DVD. The VHS starts with Thomas playing a trick on gordon and he gets back on him, then it focus's on Edward being old but useful to Henry getting shut up in a tunnel, and Thomas learning how to be a useful engine. The UK Counterpart was Thomas The Tank engine and friends as released in 1985, Thomas and Gordon as rereleased in 1988, rereleased Thomas & The Trucks 1993. It is very nostalgic to watch once every once in a while, but it was a great start to my favorite childhood show.",1396915200,2,908,4.410714285714286
