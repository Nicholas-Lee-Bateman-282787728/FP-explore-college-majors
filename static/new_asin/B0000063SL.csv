8300959,1,B0000063SL,"The 2 VHS tapes that make up SHOWBOAT COMPOSER: JEROME KERN are nothing more than a bad VHS reproduction of the 1946 MGM musical biopic TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY. Of course, they don't tell you this anywhere in the advertising of the product, so what you think you're getting is some kind of documentary about the life and work of composer Jerome Kern. You can buy a re-mastered DVD of TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY on Amazon for $2.55.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Till-the-Clouds-Roll-By-Remastered-Edition/dp/B000EBD9SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Till the Clouds Roll By (Remastered Edition)</a>&nbsp;If you want to see this movie, which is quite splendid, buy that and not this worthless piece of junk, which cost $10.",1280793600,2,760,5.8558558558558556
8300960,5,B0000063SL,"Showboat was one of the first musicals that I watched as an adult.  The first time I saw it it was on cable and I knew that I wanted to own this one!  The music in it I can only describe as delicious, the acting is just  as wonderful as well.  This movie made me understand why my mother always  had a thing for Howard Keel!  It sure tugs at your heartstrings.  I would  recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals with my whole heart!",961027200,,441,4.046511627906977
