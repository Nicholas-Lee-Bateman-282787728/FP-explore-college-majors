7872499,1,6304476051,"This is very boring. The sleeve notes do inform you that this is a narrative of a Yukon trip by four modern people attempting to recreate the original experience. I couldn't take any interest. It doesn't come off like some great adventure, it is more like a vacation at Boy Scout camp. Attempting to go down a river with people having no idea of how to do it, engaging in tug-of-war contest, visiting tourist attraction ... let me put it to you this way. Do any of you want to watch MY old home movies? If the visuals don't put you to sleep, the tired narration by Jimmy Stewart will. Not worth the time.",1426291200,,604,4.307017543859649

7872501,5,6304476051,"I recorded this off of television years ago and watched it on a regular basis, until the tape was lost! My wife and I watched it the night we started dating, perhaps we never would have gotten married with out it! I looked everywhere for it, but it never showed up, maybe it was ""borrowed"".  I am very happy that I was able to find it on Amazon! I may never make it to Alaska, but the video has certainly been part of my inspiration to ""live off the land"".",1202774400,2,456,4.066666666666666
7872502,1,6304476051,"It's unbelievable that this video is labeled ""Young Explorers."" First of all, what exactly did they accomplish?  They went down a river that countless people did over a hundred years ago during the gold rush.  More importantly, what is the message to young explorers?  They explained it as the video began winding up: that 4 hairy slackers can do whatever they want, not account to anyone, have women to share in the small part of their life that they're willing to give them (which by the way was included in the video at their pit stop), drink, curse, and then with the far away look in their eye, tell about the peace and happiness that came from getting to know the river.  I would not recommend this video to anyone who wants more for their children.  My copy went in the trash after one viewing.",1190505600,,801,4.496551724137931
7872503,5,6304476051,"I'm glad to see you actually still can buy this tape. It's an awsome adventure no doubt. I am the little blond boy living with my dad Dale, mom Inger (The swedish wife), and sister Marika in the log cabin by the Yukon river. I haven't been back to Alaska, but every time I see this film I get all exited and want to pack my bag and show my wife and kid where I grew up.",1142812800,13,369,3.8051948051948052
7872504,5,6304476051,"I saw this show a long time ago on TV and thought I would never see it again till I rented it at a local shop...3 different times...the shop is long gone but I still wanted to see it again and here it is on Amazon.....I agree with the other reviewer and feel like quitting my job and heading north every time I watch this tape...I have showed this to everyone in my family and my kids thought it was very interesting material...the scenery is fantastic and the narration by James Stewart is both comic and informative...After seeing this movie once again in 1990 I managed to paddle a canoe 125 miles down the Mississippi River, and I kept thinking of these guys on their tour of the Yukon....

  Buy this tape and see for yourself that there is a life beyond the towns and cities that we live in and escape for one hour to the wilds of Alaska and Cananda for a very enjoyable ride....",1109980800,4,885,4.287425149700598
7872505,5,6304476051,"If you love hiking,camping, white water rafting, or have the spirit of the adventurer in you...then this videos for you!!  This video chronicles a rafting trip up the Yukon river that finally culminates in a dogsled trip to Alaska. The scenery is breathtaking, and the naration by Jimmy Stewart is excellent!!  Every time I watch this video I want to quit my job move to the wilderness and live off the land.",1054944000,3,408,4.652777777777778
7872506,5,6304476051,"Like the previous reviewer, I too am hooked on this wonderful film and had to buy a copy.  It is about four men, 30ish, who set out to build a huge raft and guide it down the Yukon River until the winter hits.  At that point they take the raft apart, build a super-cool log cabin to live in until the river freezes solid, then take dog sleds across the frozen river to the remote Eskimo village of Marshall, Alaska.  It is a tad dated, being shot in 1977, but is still well worth watching.  All the guys are extremely intelligent and gregarious, and the scenery and action are fantastic.  This one shines; buy a copy.",1031788800,3,617,4.2844827586206895
7872507,5,6304476051,"When Paul whatever his name is (the man gracing the cover of this extraordinary video) speaks these words you know what this voyage is all about. Not that there weren't plenty of hints to make it evident prior to these words. This video is about men, about what real men are all about, not the Yukon Passage. There is hard work, boozing, womanizing, and a fair share of folly. This said I must say that the journey these four bearded beauties take is awe inspiring. I'd love to do something like this, perhaps a little less grandiose, and with other changes. First thing is I wouldn't have a camera there to record the machismo. Highlights have to be: the soliloquys given near the beginning and again at the end by each of the crew, 'King of the Castle"" on the raft, Diamond Tooth Gurtie's obvious discomfort with a drunken Paul, four men on a raft barreling towards a large rock, lifejackets visible, but worn by none, Jerry's attempts to avoid the rock by paddling a ten tonne raft with a canoe paddle, and the difficult attempts to push the raft back into the water after running aground (they look like they're trying so hard). Did I mention Jimmy Stewart narrates? There are some beautiful backdrops in this film and the re-creation of such a monumental historic event is certainly worthwhile. We rented it so often we had to own it, the wife and I can't get enough of this little gem. If you like this video check out the book, Man of the Creeks, by Robert Kroetsch, the story behind The Shooting of Dan McGrew.",1017792000,4,1518,4.5236363636363635
7872508,4,6304476051,"I enjoyed the Yukon Passage.  It is a good tale of four hoodlems who set off on a remarkable journey.  The four run into a little trouble when they run into a giant rock on their raft, but their efforts pay off when they  reach the town.  National Geographic did a nice job with this one by  introducing Jimmy Stewart, but it is not quite as good as the ""Realm  of the Coyote"".",952646400,7,377,4.095890410958904
