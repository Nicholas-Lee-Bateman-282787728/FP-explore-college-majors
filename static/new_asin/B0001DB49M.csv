8010623,1,B0001DB49M,"I am a teacher and ordered this video to show in class.  I previewed it and decided that even though I had bought it I would not make them watch it.  Boring narration, confusing line, not much modern footage....mostly photos.  Disappointing!",1302825600,,241,4.829268292682927
8010624,1,B0001DB49M,"The script for the narration of this video is very poor. It is disjointed and very superficial, and if shown to, say high school students studying Latin America, it would require a lot of explanation. The video is afraid to confront controversy, except toward the very end it suddenly makes a few statements about how ""art like everything else, has become a tool of revolution,"" and ""in time, new generations may bring Cuba to a new direction."" This is as complex as the video gets. If you're buying it to learn about culture or the history, you don't get much either. What you do get is one non sequiter after the other. ""Geographically Cuba is the perfect tropical island."" What does that mean? -- the video does not explain. It spends several minutes on the U.S. occupation in 1898, but NEVER mentions how Castro got there! It makes the statement that ""life has changed little"" with the implication being ""life under Castro,"" but again, doesn't come out and say it -- a confusing statement for anyone not already familiar with the history. It shows a scene of young people walking in uniforms down a street and says they are foreign exchange students being ""indoctrinated"" but it doesn't say what they're being indoctrinated into. It states ""Pubicly, Che Guevara holds the spotlight,"" but doesn't say who Che Guevara was! Making all this worse is a very dry narration. Very dissatisfying video.",1157068800,2,1397,4.825
