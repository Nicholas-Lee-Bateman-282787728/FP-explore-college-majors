8205724,5,B000SKVMLI,"Some of the very best guitar techniques authored by a great man and person.
I bought both books. They were worth ten times the price.",1427414400,,133,4.36
8205725,1,B000SKVMLI,"Don't waste your money, it seems I sat and watched this for two hours and learned absolutely nothing. If you have a very basic knowledge of thumbpicking style this DVD will be a colossal waste of your time.",1376352000,,206,4.447368421052632
8205726,4,B000SKVMLI,First review I was confused between the book and the DVD.  The DVD is good teaching tool if you want to learn the techniques used by Chet.  Goes into good detail about the unique patterns used by Chet.  Would be helpfull if there was an accompaning tab booklet.,1355270400,,261,4.395833333333333
8205727,2,B000SKVMLI,"Disappointed b/c no complete breakdown of Chet's songs. Disc 1 is about basic/general stuff (alternative bass & arpeggio), and Disc 2 is about licks. I wanted to be able to play a whole song, not only the solos. There is no instruction of that sort (even no tabs included). I was not interested in what scale Chet uses, but wanted to know how Chet played the whole song (fingering and voicing)...  BTW, I was surprised there was no clip of Chet's playing songs on the 2 discs.",1336348800,,476,4.471264367816092
8205728,5,B000SKVMLI,Although it is not Chet in this video it is very educational for those that aspire to play like Chet.  I will play this over and over until I master it,1293753600,,151,3.870967741935484
8205729,5,B000SKVMLI,Just like having a private tutor on your hard drive. This man was the best and greatest at his chosen profession.,1278806400,,113,4.428571428571429
