8140224,5,B000HKTCBQ,"Although Hagee is a ""fire and brimstone"" type preacher, his words are brave and unfaltering when it comes to
our Jewish friends in Israel and what they face as a nation on a daily basis, surrounded by people who's books clearly say to eliminate the Jews.

I admire his bravery in light of the continual attempts at character assassination, as would be expected from
anyone who is staunchly behind Israel. Look how Rupert Murdoch has been targeted and demonized because he is one
of the voices of support for a people that need a let-up from the demonization they undeservedly get, stemming
from the mideastern Islamic mindset due to the vast amount of vitriole against them in books that some call ""holy"".

I'd strongly recommend adding this to your collection if you love Israel and want to understand her relation with the Church.",1339718400,,832,4.811188811188811
