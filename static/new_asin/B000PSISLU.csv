8193036,4,B000PSISLU,"This DVD offers up some good quality information, however, the production is a little dated and shows it age. Nonetheless, most of the service principles remain the same as 2-stroke engines haven't really changed a whole lot in recent years. Worthwhile if you want to do some of your own outboard servicing, but perhaps grab a more detailed service manual book for your outboard to go along with this DVD.",1203897600,,405,4.8
