I would recommend THE ZACHERLEY ARCHIVES for all fans who wish to relive memories of watching late night television while their parents slept and enjoying the ridiculous antics of this talented, humorous and very original TV innovator.

This material includes B&W kinescopes filmed directly off the TV tube of Zach demonstrating his brilliant gift for improvisation, the sight gag and resourcefulness. In addition to his often-unrehearsed dialogue, he was always able to conjure up some visually interesting business we just couldn't take our eyes off of and was required to do this on a miniscule budget.

His first nostalgic romp takes us through the John Zacherle version of Project Mohole in which he erects a drilling tower right through the floor of his wife's coffin. He created this magic using nothing more than audio echo effects, four tower poles, some clothes line and a pulley and had us all believing that his mysterious assistant Gasport (who normally is stored in a sack on a meat hook) was digging through the Earth's mantle and unearthing actual living reptiles as well as other  archeological finds from the deep.

His next piece demonstrates his talent for creating an interesting visual experience on a budget when the scene opens with a very tilted candelabra on the lid of his wife's closed coffin. Just when you start wondering why the candle holder is at such a wild angle he reaches down to snatch his wife's stake and uses it to prop open the coffin lid to create a convincing piano. You then notice that the candle resting on the now inclined lid of the coffin is correctly oriented, just as the music starts.

During one piece of insanity Zach is writing and performing an operatic piece entitled Il Dracularie. As we all remember, Zach had a very interesting, beautiful deep quality to his voice and could do more than carry a tune. His voice is actually quite good and as we all know, he made several successful records. This piece went on a little to long for my taste but I know Zach fans who enjoyed every second of the elaborate opera.

Probably the best moments of this DVD revolve around an evening of Zach behaving quite insanely by removing his wife's apparently invisible body from her coffin and dancing around during a wild party at which conversations are held with other invisible guests ranging from Princess Ananka to the royalty of Transylvania. During the questionable party a siren is heard from outside and a white-coated gentleman appears whom Zach recognizes and addresses as Dr. Bellevue.

At first Zach appears to be humorless and resigned to some dark fate as he realizes what business the white-coated person is there on. Then he gets his second wind and continues his merry party by introducing the doctor to his invisible guests including the count, wolfman, Frankenstein monster and the Crowned heads of Transylvania.

Although Dr. Bellevue is intent on taking care of his business by returning Zach to the asylum, it doesn't stop him from first participating in the imaginary festivities. Perhaps, at first to humor Zach, Dr. Bellevue dons a party hat and samples some of Zach's dinosaur eggnog created by siphoning juice, pits and all, from a watermelon (which seems to have fermented based on the doctor's reaction). In the end the white-coated gentlemen receives a call and pulls Zach off the set in a very business like manner. Dr. Bellevue was played by sound effects man Bob Prescott.

This feature is for all dedicated Zacherley fans who wish to relive memories of Zach during some of his finest moments. Although the DVD material is explained and supplemented by several minutes of crisp new B&W footage of Zach recorded at Scrivani Studios, please be advised that the vintage video quality can only live up to that of the original kinescopes which were filmed off a television picture tube.

Some additional words about the bonus features of Zacherley's Closet.  If you ever sent in some art work or fan mail to Zach and wish to hear your name mentioned he opens his closet up and reviews many of the materials he has accumulated over the years from grateful fans in makeup and living color.",1190332800,5,4187,4.856942496493689
