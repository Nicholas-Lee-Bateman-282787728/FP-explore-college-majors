I actually played a small  ( telephone ) role in the reunion. I was also homeless with my brother and father on the near westside of Chicago. We also lived on the southside where me and my 2 brother's had alot of ups and downs. My nephew ""Rhymefest"" is a 2 year Grammy award winner, Oscar and Golden Globe winner. PS. He now owns the childhood home that we all grew up in.",1455840000,,536,4.254901960784314

8734955,5,B015XC8C3Q,"A son is moved to find and reconnect with his long lost father.  It is an unusual story which weaves the past into the present.  The son buys his childhood home later to find that his homeless father lives near him. The viewer follows the son through a chain of events which includes unconditional love and sometimes frustration. As each scene unfolds, the why's of the son being abandoned becomes clearer. Does a long lost father who had experienced the horrors of childhood, and decades of homelessness get a second chance in life?  Meanwhile, the son blurs the lines between being a social advocate, a parent, and back to a son as he eventually heals his internal wounds.

The additional appeal of this documentary reveals the whole social support of moving someone familiar with one environment into an entirely different environment. It was enlightening to see that with each step towards the new life there were parts which blurred with the path of the old life. As someone watching this film you could visually see the importance of replacing one activity with another as rapidly as possible. Furthermore, the new activity had to reinforce the new life which makes the transition a more permanent opportunity for the individual.",1456099200,,1235,4.923076923076923
