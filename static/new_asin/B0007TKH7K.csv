2242499,4,B0007TKH7K,"I purchased this 2 disc set for my father for his birthday and he just loves them. He could watch Tim Conway and Carol Burnett all day!! I just love amazon.com; the list of movies available is unending. I might have a look for some good Blue Collar Tour tapes for myself and I don't think I will have to look any further than here!!

Thanks for your prompt delivery as well,

2242500,5,B0007TKH7K,"Funny and something you can watch with the whole family.  Just for them to share some of their favorite schenes  showed  how much they enjoyed doing the show and how they ad-libed some of the scenes.  No sooner you are done laughing at what you saw, along comes another skit just as funny or even better.  We kept saying--oh-I remember that !  Really worth the price.",1140739200,11,367,4.484848484848484
2242501,1,B0007TKH7K,This two pack set was a BIG disappointment. The old cast spent way too much of the 42 MINUTES!! talking and taking question from the current audience and doing boring musical numbers and not enough of the classic Carol Burnett Show. Both DVDs would have been an interesting Special Feature Bonus track on a complete season DVD of the show. I personally felt cheated and will be careful before buying anything else from CBS/Paramount Collection,1138147200,240,443,4.92
2242502,5,B0007TKH7K,"I agree with you Filman ""The Rose"".... Awhile ago I was very interested in purchasing The Carol Burnett Show but they didn't have it on dvd. I was watching ""The Tony Danza show also this morning and saw Carol Burnett as a guest and it just made me want the box set all over again so I too came to amazon to see if it was available and to my shocking surprise 2 EPISODES PER DISC!!!!!! :( How disappointed I am.... I guess I will be second in line after you waiting on the box set deal..... wink wink....",1134691200,42,503,4.090909090909091
2242503,5,B0007TKH7K,"I was watching the Tony Danza show this morning and one of his guests was Carol Burnett. Watching the old clips from her 70's show really made me want them on DVD so I signed onto Amazon.com to see if they were available. To my amazement, I found that there are only TWO EPISODES PER VOLUME and very costly!!

I hope they consider box sets with multiple episodes SOON..when this happens I will be the first in line to purchase them. But at TWO EPISODES PER VOLUME AT THOSE PRICES???!!! No way.

Still love you, Carol!

2242504,5,B0007TKH7K,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift and will not be able to review until Dec 25.

However, it's Carol Burnett - how could anyone not enjoy it.",1126742400,8,148,4.103448275862069
2242505,5,B0007TKH7K,"Carol Burnett was clearly in her element during the Q&A part of her series, and this DVD shows many of the funniest highlights the show has to offer. It's also great to see that Carol, Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway, and Harvey Korman still have it now, even 30 years later. Their quick wit, comic timing, and gift for ad-libbing shine through! Highly recommended!",1117756800,41,360,4.73015873015873

2242538,4,B0007TKH7K,I really enjoyed this video.  Many wonderful skits from the old carol burnet show I. A great collection.  Wonderful interview of the cast.  I would highly recommend these videos.,1401840000,,178,5.068965517241379
2242539,5,B0007TKH7K,I have wanted this collection for years but couldn't afford it. I love that there is a place I can go and order these at a good price and have hours of laughter. It takes me back to my teenage years when I would watch the show on Sat night,1391731200,,239,3.8
2242540,5,B0007TKH7K,"You have to buy this! I laughed through the entire time!  Seriously,  though the actors have aged, the sense of humor is never lost.",1390176000,,132,4.458333333333333

2242544,4,B0007TKH7K,This DVD brought back memories of years ago.  Also interesting to see the stars in present time.  Lots of laughs.,1362614400,,113,4.6
2242545,5,B0007TKH7K,What else can anyone say about the reruns of Carol Burnett!  Funny and the comination of her with the other actors are fantastic,1358726400,,128,4.565217391304348
2242556,5,B0007TKH7K,My mom and I loved it. If you're a fan of Carol I suggest you get it. Very good deal.,1343606400,,85,3.3

2242559,3,B0007TKH7K,"The quality of the product is great. The show was good but only 40 minutes long and it wasn't the real show it was little clips.  It was mostly the cast taking questions from the audience.  I really wanted to see the original show, so I was dissappointed.",1323388800,2,255,4.291666666666667
2242560,1,B0007TKH7K,"Please look the back of the DVD cover and see if they have subtitles or CC (Closed Captions). I am deaf and want to read what they are saying.
I appreicated it and thank you.",1298764800,,174,4.0
2242561,2,B0007TKH7K,"This panel discussion with the cast members was interesting, but not what I thought that I was getting.  I was thinking that this would include some episodes or long clips, but it didn't.  My kids never saw the show, so they weren't able to appreciate the panel discussion.  If you're looking for the Carol Burnett show, don't waste your money on this.",1296518400,,352,4.645161290322581
2242562,1,B0007TKH7K,"This video is very disappointing. We bought this as a family gift for Christmas.  We thought it would show clips of the Carol Burnett Show but all the video contains is clips from the chat sessions that used to take place before the show.  I would have sent the video back, but we already viewed it.  Save your time and money, DON'T buy this video!!!!!!!!",1295395200,2,355,4.430769230769231
2242563,2,B0007TKH7K,I was very disappointed in the content.  It was great to see them together but I was looking forward to some of the skits from the show and there were only a few short clips.  Mostly questions and answer sessions and the cast joking around.,1293494400,,240,4.311111111111111
2242564,5,B0007TKH7K,Had forgotten how funny and adult this show appears.  Too bad this type of show has been lost to sex and clime.  Carol had sex but not so much up front.  You could let the kids watch and not worry about what was going to happen.,1289692800,,228,3.9130434782608696
2242565,1,B0007TKH7K,Trying to find the old shows - nostalgic gift for my wife-kept getting references on this DVD to 'containing old shows'  - didn't read close enough - or wasn't able to read between the lines  sufficiently to see that this wasn't what I wanted.  Felt mislead and very disappointed.,1284768000,3,280,4.673469387755102
2242576,2,B0007TKH7K,I did not find this DVD very interesting.  It is not what I expected.,1284249600,,69,3.9285714285714284
2242577,5,B0007TKH7K,It brought back memories of when I watched Carol's show each week and laughed and laughed!  I had forgotten.  I am so glad I ordered this.,1282521600,3,138,4.269230769230769
2242578,5,B0007TKH7K,This was a very good DVD. I really enjoyed watching it. It brought back many good memories.,1278892800,,91,4.411764705882353
2242579,2,B0007TKH7K,"I was disappointed in the Let's Bump Up the Lights/Showstopper set. I was expecting episodes from the old Carol Burnett Show, but instead it was a ""Reunion Show"" - I am not likely to watch it again and it was NOT worth the money!!!",1265414400,3,231,4.2727272727272725
2242580,1,B0007TKH7K,"""Very Disappointed"" were the words that were used to describe this DVD.
It was a gift for my Mother, who is a huge Carol Burnett fan.
The example that she gave me: ""It was the same questions from the audience and Carol's different responses to them. Not what I was hoping to watch.""",1263340800,,282,4.339622641509434
2242581,3,B0007TKH7K,This dvd was funny and appealing as all the shows of Carol Burnett were.  But it is just exerpts of funny moments.  I was hoping for a few whole skits in the shows that took place. That was not to happen.  I have some old Sid Caesar tapes that have actual shows.  They are worth the money.  J.

2242582,3,B0007TKH7K,"I purchased this for my mother for her birthday knowing that she would enjoy seeing the Carol Burnett Show once again, but didn't realize it was more like a review of the cast and their take on the show.  They did show clips of certain scene's or skit's if you will, to which the actors did some comentary on.  It would have been better for them to have a collection of the TV show in it's full run of each episode throughout the years.  Maybe it just hasen't been released yet.  My mother was certainly disapointed that she couldn't see the whole episode, but still had some good laughs watching the clips.  I felt bad, but it was too late.  Maybe in the future they will get permission to release the full episodes and make a boxed collection series.",1249171200,4,752,4.374100719424461
2242583,1,B0007TKH7K,"I knew this would be a show about the show, but there were too few clips--many of them only long enough to catch a facial expression or two.  I bought it to acquaint a young friend with the Carol Burnett Show, but there wasn't enough there to even interest her in it, much less give her a sense of what it was like.

2242585,1,B0007TKH7K,I was expecting more high lights from the shows. Too much talk and not enough of vintage skits. I will not buy any more.,1236643200,,120,4.041666666666667
2242596,1,B0007TKH7K,"I received 2 copies of disc #1 only.  Sloppy packaging, and too much trouble to mail back as this was ordered as a gift",1231459200,,119,3.9583333333333335
2242597,1,B0007TKH7K,I was very excited to receive two Carol Burnett DVDs thinking that they were comprised of just outtakes from the regular  show. They turned out to be a series of interactions between Carol and her cast and a live audience. Very boring and dissappointing. I loved the show and was repulsed by the fawning fans. Very little comedy.,1231372800,12,329,4.672413793103448

2242599,1,B0007TKH7K,"I really didn't care for this DVD. Thought it would be from the old shows and not just all of them on stage.  Like the ones with Tim Conway, and Harvey Korman, and Miss Wiggins.",1225324800,2,177,4.057142857142857
2242600,1,B0007TKH7K,This item was a birthday gift for my wife since she loves Carol Burnett.  She was terribly disappointed when both dvds were only clips and cast discussion regarding their most memorable years. What my wife wanted was the seasons dvd starting with Season 1 or any season episode available.  None of the season dvds are able to be purchased.,1222041600,9,339,4.728813559322034

2242602,2,B0007TKH7K,"I bought this hoping that it was mostly excerpts from the show, but it was mostly Carol and others talking with not enough of what we all loved so much back in the day.",1210377600,4,168,3.9705882352941178

2242604,2,B0007TKH7K,"Perhaps I didn't carefully read the description of the video...therefore, we were disappointed in the video.  It is ONLY the ""bump up the lights"" parts of several Carol Burnett Shows - None of the other parts of the show. It was OK.",1200096000,,232,4.523809523809524
2242605,1,B0007TKH7K,"What a waste of money!  I expected a wide variety of the funniest skits from the CB show, but all these videos are is a bunch of old people laughing at their screw-ups.  I don't even get to see the whole skit, so I don't see the humor in it.  Yes, the Carol Burnett Show was great.  I don't need to pay money (and time) to be told that!",1197936000,7,336,3.8260869565217392

Be careful.",1195776000,23,218,4.615384615384615
2242627,2,B0007TKH7K,Maybe i didn't read what it was about well enough. i wanted a DVD with several different shows on it and all it was was them sitting around talking about the show and some highlights from past shows where Carol comes out and answers the audience's questions. Kinda boring actually.,1190937600,42,281,4.64

2242630,1,B0007TKH7K,"I read the plot outline ""Television show featuring skits by Carol Burnett and her comedy troupe"" and expected 30 minutes of the best of her shows.

I bought 2 sets to give as Christmas gifts.  One of them was to my mom, which we watched together.  Waaaaay too much talk, not enough scenes and not one complete skit!

I recorded the 25th anniversery of CBShow on VHS some years ago, and I thought that was  what I was going to get.  This is may be a money maker, as so many of us like CB, but this is absolutely false advertising.  I unfortunately opened it up and probably will not get my money back, but I warn you, this DVD and Carol Burnett Show stoppers is not worth the postage.
