Like the True Obsessive-Compulsive Hip Hop Scientist that he is, Edan documented every move he made.  It's all in the fantastic hand-stamped liner notes.  Homeboy plays Moogs, the Kazoo, and even some gheTaur. This is a monumental Classic.
I don't even know if I am reviewing the audio capsule or the DVD.  I am too spaced out to even care.
Edan has taken my Terran Brain and transported it to another realm with this delicious and vicious work of Hip Hop Art.
Apparently, Edan got his magical hands on the entire catalog of some record label (I am too spaced to look it up).
So instead of doing a pedestrian mega-mix, Edan Portnoy decided to flip the script, using his true Hip Hop nature to create a whole new platform.
You need this like yesterday!
My man hand stamps these gems... I got it on CD and DVD. It's that fresh!
Even my baby loves this. It's in her DNA.
No joke, when I brought her home from the Hospital, this was the first thing I let her see on the TV and she loved it. She has been super incredible ever since!
A one month old baby realized this was awesome. How you gonna front on that?",1330041600,10,1244,4.349137931034483
