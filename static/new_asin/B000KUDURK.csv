8159089,4,B000KUDURK,"The ""Introduction to Life Casting"" DVD is a good introduction to the subject, but geared to Smooth-On's line of products. Smooth-On does make very good products but they can be over priced. If you are just getting started in mold making and/or casting, this video is a good beginning point and a Smooth-On starter kit might be the way to go. This video is also available in the Smooth-On Life Casting Kit.

The video does a good job taking you through the process of preparing the model, mixxing and applying silicone/alginate, demolding, mixxing and pouring casting resin, and various finnishing options. You can learn quite a bit from this video that can be applied to this hobby.

As you get more experience, check out other sites by doing searches on words like ""alginate"", ""casting resin"", ""silicone"", ""hobby silicone"", etc. You will find many sites offering good products at prices that are likely better than Smooth-On.

Recommended for the beginer, experienced life casters will get little out of this DVD.",1229817600,2,1014,4.988165680473373
