8016704,4,B0001VGAH0,"Chi Kung reminds me of Tai Chi but this DVD focuses on movements of the arms and hands while seated. It is very calming as there are controlled breathing exercises to help alleviate stress. You can feel the anxious body settling into relaxation. I did the entire DVD but it seems Terence Dunn is teaching you how to do Chi Kung so you can eventually do it with your eyes closed on your own. The movements are very simple and not overly strenuous. However, one pose does require you to keep your hands up in the air for an extended time. If you are looking to get rid of stress this might work for you. It is purely exercises with no spiritual philosophies. The music playing in the background is also very beautiful.

8016705,5,B0001VGAH0,"This is slightly different than many other Qigong styles. There are breathing sequences for each of the exercises. These are said to help qi flow better for each exercise. All I can say is, there are many Qigong styles, and the main thing to note, to get anywhere with energy work takes years to develop and cultivate. Find a good style and stick to it. This style may be the one for you!",1490227200,,388,4.328767123287672
8016706,5,B0001VGAH0,"Sifu Terence Dunn is an excellent teacher of Qigong. I have use his courses since 2005 and since I have tried other courses in Qigong and though the instruction was good, the results were not impressive and I returned to Sifu Dunn's Flying Phoenix system because it has improved my martial arts and helped with other issues from my time in the service. Another thing I really like as a Christian that Sifu Dunn does not push Eastern Spirituality other than to explain where the system comes from. If you have ever listened to the famous psychiatrist Dr. Roy Masters and his therapy for stress, pain management and PTSD you can really appreciate Sifu Dunn's instruction. Bottom line is the system is powerful amd works.",1431993600,,718,4.752

8016709,5,B0001VGAH0,"Another must-buy.  These are seated chi kung (qigong) exercises which means they can be performed even by those who have trouble standing for long periods (or who can't stand at all, for that matter).  I haven't found many videos which teach sitting forms, but I'd bet that this and 'Blossoms in the Spring' are the best.  Flying Phoenix chi kung is very easy to learn and the effects are quite dramatic.  Thanks go out to Terry Dunn for sharing these methods.",1405555200,3,460,4.6419753086419755
8016710,5,B0001VGAH0,"I had had good luck with Terry's Tai Chi DVDs as well as his Tai Chi Ruler DVD, so thought I
would try this set of qigong DVDs.  All of te DVDs in this Flying Phoenix series are worth using as a basis for your workout.  If you are fairly new, I would recommend the Volume 1 and 2 be purchased together and used together.  Also there is a lot of useful
data from Terry on the forum ""Tao Bums"".",1376352000,3,392,3.875

8016712,5,B0001VGAH0,"There is a lot of information about this series on another website. Among the advantages of the Flying Phoenix system, according to Terry Dunn, include: FP comes from a 400-year-old lineage, and is not a ""broken lineage"" like probably all other qigong DVDs and books; it cultivates a ""healing qi"" that makes it safe to learn without a live teacher; it requires no visualization; it requires no coordination of breath with movements (there is a breath pattern specific to each meditation that you perform once); it requires no focus of attention or mantra; it requires no theory, philosophy or belief.

This has quickly become my main meditation practice. It feels like sacrilege to say this regarding any meditative practice, but this is pleasurable. If you are thinking about trying only one DVD at first, try this one, Volume 2, the seated meditations. While the standing meds may be more powerful, I felt what was ""special"" about this system first while doing the seated meds. Something about breaking out in a sweat while seated and barely moving my forearms ""at the speed of a shifting sand dune"" that made me a believer.

You could be a skeptic and theorize about self-hypnosis or placebo effects or neurological tricks, but it's important to remember that you don't have to be that skeptic. I feel better without effort. I see benefits in how I interact with people. To me, that's ""healing"" in itself. It's worth the effort.",1351123200,6,1431,4.88477366255144
8016713,5,B0001VGAH0,"I've bought dozens of Chi Kung videos, but I have not come across anything like Sifu Dunn's Flying Phoenix Chi Kung DVDs.  They are simple to learn and very powerful.  A perfect introduction for a beginner, and also a great addition to more experienced practitioner's routine.

I have been doing seated meditation for years, but not like this!  I was just sitting there counting breaths before.  Sifu Terry teaches a sophisticated breathing method that really seems to amplify the meditative experience.

The seated meditations are a great complement to the standing medidtations in Volume 1.  I practiced the standing meditations for a few months before I bought Volume 2 and now I can't believe I waited that long.  I like the seated meditations just as much, if not more, than the standing ones.  I always practice them together now, and I usually start out with a couple of the seated meditations and finish with a couple standing ones.",1315526400,12,940,4.89873417721519
