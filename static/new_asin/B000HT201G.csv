8141054,5,B000HT201G,"I recently started playing hockey again after a 28 year lay off.  I watched the video and then attended a local power skating class at my local rink.  Everything taught at the local class was consistent with the video.  However, this video goes into much more detail and contains much more material than could be taught in a night of power skating class.  The drills and explanations in the video are clear, concise, and well demonstrated.",1367280000,3,439,4.7368421052631575
8141055,4,B000HT201G,"The books is better at describing the methods and should be bought first, then the DVD is necessary to make sure you are doing it right. Don't skimp, buy them both, but get the book first!",1310256000,5,188,4.25
8141056,5,B000HT201G,Great stuff! More information than I'll master in quite a while and it's helped my skating a ton already.,1245024000,5,105,4.578947368421052
8141057,5,B000HT201G,"The price tag for this DVD is a little steep but worth every penny!  I have other ""how to do it"" DVD's on hockey skating, and they are pretty good but not in the same league with this one.  Laura's book, together with this DVD cover everything you need to know.  Doesn't matter if you are using it to teach yourself, or somebody else she very effectively covers this complicated issue in a clear, easy way to understand.  Even if you are already a good skater and want to improve your game...this is it.
So...why did I get this DVD?  I am teaching my 9 yr. old to play hockey.  I have never coached before and wanted a 'bible' to use as refrence so I bought Laura's accompanying book (same title).  The book is a wee bit 'dry' and difficult to use with a kid.  Getting the DVD was the best thing I could have done to help him understand what it takes to become an accomplished and powerful skater. The skaters who demonstrate the basic techniques on the DVD are perfect for showing what to do and what not to do.
Parents, coaches and players...get this book.  You will not be sorry!",1204934400,17,1082,4.29064039408867
