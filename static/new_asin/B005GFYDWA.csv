8471517,5,B005GFYDWA,"Amazing Landscapes Vol. 3 is an excellent purchase! The DVD is great for landscaping ideas for home owners with big aspirations and professional landscapers looking to develop their artistic eye. Each project is hand crafted, unique, and very artistic. Flagstone Palace stood out to me...incredible. There are many other amazing landscapes, waterfalls and terraces...Check it out!",1355270400,,380,5.803571428571429
8471518,5,B005GFYDWA,"This video is chock full of great ideas from real people's properties that are 'before', 'during' and 'after' shots.  This is not really a manual for how to do it but rather alot of different looks and styles.  I think that Paul has a good eye for color and style and each person is different, so he tries to show many different things/options.  If you are watching so you can learn the trade, then you will be disappointed but if you are a homeowner in need of some inspirational ideas, themes, colors, etc that incorporate different types of plants (such as low water) stones, focal points etc, then you will get alot out of Paul's video.",1328400000,,640,4.5
8471519,5,B005GFYDWA,"After purchasing volume 1& 2 of Amazing Landscape Transformations, I'm so excited to see there is a new volume in the series.  We truly enjoyed seeing how the landscapes change over time and all the ideas we received for our own unique situation around our home and property. We were so impressed with the work on the DVD's that we actually hired Paul to build us two beautiful waterfalls, flagstone walkways, rock gardens, and a one-of-a-kind fountain made out of stone.
The integrity, honesty, and tremendous imagination of Paul Nordmark made our landscape a true work of art.  He went above and beyond what we could have ever expected and I'm so excited to order this newest volume to see if our landscape will be showcased in it.",1315008000,,733,4.71875
8471520,5,B005GFYDWA,"It's is amazing to me how this brand new DVD can get a negitive review the same day Amazon.com received their first shipment with no sales yet. Volume 3 is a gold mine of ideas for homeowners, full of hundreds of ideas for all the different situations around a home. It includes very colorful landscapes I have designed and built by God's grace that can be achieved by the homeowner. The introduction is on color, design, and technique including how you can create a focal point in the landscape. There is a 1 hour commentary as you see each landscape unfold before your eyes. Numerous landscapes of different designs of front yards, backyards and waterfalls using different textures and colors of stones and plants from around America. The designs are simple to complex, from small to massive, and everything in-between. A great resource of ideas for someone wanting to create a beautiful paradise around their home. The complete series is now available with projects ranging from 1,000 dollars to 100,000 dollars and everything in-between. Artistic landscaping ideas seen on all 3 Volumes for a very affordable price. There are a lot of low water landscaping designs in Volume 3. We all need to conserve water... especially in Texas, California, Colorado, Nevada,Arizona and various parts of the mid-west. These DVD's were produced with the homeowner in mind to help them see the process of achieving a beautiful yard for their long term investment on flat land areas, gentle slopes, mid grade slopes and large steep hillsides that can all be be spectacular with vision and inspiration.",1314921600,,1588,4.996226415094339
8471521,1,B005GFYDWA,"There are no explantions about how you choose stones or flowers and start to plan. It keeps showing different initial condition, 5 years later etc of various landscapes.  I bought v1 and v2. Complete waste of money. useless. It is basically commercial to sell stones.",1314921600,,267,4.933333333333334
