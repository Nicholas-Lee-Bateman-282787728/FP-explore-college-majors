8689508,4,B00PW5Y7RA,"Charming if slightly hectic Russian movie from 1952 with impressive special effects, Rimsky-Korsakov music.  Kids should like it.  A slightly shortened version of the film was Americanized into ""The Magic Voyage of Sinbad"" by Roger Corman(!) in 1962 with many of the Russian references altered, then sent up at Mystery Science Theater in 1993 as Episode 505.  This one can stand on its own, though.",1491609600,,398,5.092307692307692
8689509,3,B00PW5Y7RA,"I like the movie and the opera, but there is a problem with the picture.  In several places, the video portion breaks up, while the audio portion remains fine.  I had bought this DVD several years ago and had this same problem.  I thought that it was the disc itself and just bought it again, thinking that it was an isolated issue.  Apparently it is not, as the new disc had the same problem.  I only gave it 3 stars due to the technical issues.  Other than that, the picture and sound quality are great, far better than the U.S. dubbed The Magic Voyage of Sinbad.",1444089600,2,565,4.283018867924528
8689510,4,B00PW5Y7RA,"Very nice Russian fairy tale.  Russian-language with various sub-titles, including English.  A seafaring adventurer comes back to his village and finds all the paupers miserable.  At first he tries to even out the score between the poor and the rich.  Even though he manages that there is still unhappiness, so he decides, with a crew, to search the world for a mythical bird of happiness.  After years of searching, and an adventure in the undersea kingdom he realizes that happiness can only be found within and there is no place like home.  The effects range from silly to extremely good.  This film is also available dubbed in English as The Magic Voyage of Sinbad, but with mediocre DVD picture quality.  Was, as The Magic Voyage of Sinbad, given the MST3K treatment in a very funny way.  The Rusico DVD release is the one to get.  The color and picture quality is fine, the best available.  Recommended for fans of this genre.",1422403200,4,932,4.726708074534161
