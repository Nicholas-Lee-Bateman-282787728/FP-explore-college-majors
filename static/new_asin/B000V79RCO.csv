2932747,3,B000V79RCO,"""Hungama"" is an hilarious movie; a few lies and subsequent dramas based on misunderstandings.

The *stars* of this movie are Akshaye Khanna, Aftab Shivdasani and Rimi Sen, however, most of the action takes place with seasoned support actors, particularly Paresh Rawal, and also Shakti Kapoor, Rajpal Yadav, Razak Khan and Shoma Anand, as well as lesser known actors including Jagdish, Sanjay Narula and Manoj Joshi, while Tiku Talsania is surprisingly serious in this movie, but his hot wife is hilarious.

In fact, watching the movie it was clear Rimi Sen can't act very well, and being in good company it was more obvious. The girl who played 'Madhuri' or Tiku's wife were far better actresses, so that's one thing that stuck out, a lack of a great 'heroine'. Even Aftab is a bit wooden but not so bad.

There are so many subplots that are not resolved, and they keep you wondering, like what happened to the guy pretending to be rich Tiwari's (P Rawals) son, what happened to Tiku Talsania and his flirty wife, what happened to so-and-so who was in a fix before... the makers' of this film don't really care they just want the comedy/action to start and want the funny scenes, explaining everything is not so important, as often happens in Hindi movies.

That said, it's very funny, especially Shakti Kapoor, that scene where he tells Tiku to put his hands up, and Tiku, wedged in a crate, says it's not possible! Or Shakti getting slam-dunked by a crate, hilarious stuff!",1379289600,,1475,4.772549019607843

2932749,4,B000V79RCO,"This movie was truly awesome! It is so hilarious, it will definitely make you laugh uncontrollably! I have never a seen such a great comedy. This is now my favorite movie. Paresh Rawal, of course, gave another brilliant performance. Akshaye and Aftab also were terrific. It is really funny how all the characters have some connection to each other and how continuous misunderstandings among these 26 characters lead to absolute chaos! Whoever wrote the script for this movie is a genius. The movie also makes fun of cliched Bollywood scenes. If I could, I would give this movie an 11 out of 10. This is one comedy you cannot afford to miss!",1304380800,,640,4.723214285714286
2932750,5,B000V79RCO,"This is definitely an underrated Hindi movie! Whether that's because there isn't a Khan as a lead role or because there aren't many interesting song/dance numbers, I do not know, but I think anyone who likes a good comedy should like this movie.

It starts off with a young woman (Anjali) who goes to the big city to secure a job and achieve independence from her family. Struggling to find a good apartment, she decides to room with a young man (Nandu) and pretends to be his wife so the landlord will approve them as tenants. She doesn't get along with him, but until her financial status improves, she's stuck with him. Anjali has a hard time finding a job, until another young man (Jeetu) allows her to work in his new electronics store. Jeetu develops feelings for Anjali under the impression that she's the daughter of a rich businessman (Tiwari), and this businessman becomes a part of the story too. He and his wife are developing misunderstandings about each other, constantly fighting, while trying to protect themselves from several people that want to take advantage of their wealth and vulnerability.

More conflicts arise that connect various characters to each other's lives, and the story becomes...well, a commotion. That's exactly what the title ""Hungama"" means, a commotion, and as the movie progresses, the plot thickens with more outrageous characters that become involved with either Jeetu, Nandu, Anjali, Tiwari, or a combination of these people. What you get is a  entertaining film full of lies, misconceptions, and plain fun.",1294617600,,1551,5.003875968992248

2932764,5,B000V79RCO,"This is a nice and funny movie by Priyadarshan. Compared to much of the Bollywood cinema of this decade, the 2010s, this was a cleaner, more decent comedy. I watched this movie for the first time years ago (2003, so thirteen years ago), not long after the DVD had released and my local Hindi rental shop in Flushing, Queens, had it available on VHS. Even though it might not be the greatest Hindi comedy out there, there are several scenes worth your while. ""Kachra seth"" (the Trash King) and ""Chota chetan"" (some gangster, whose name means ""Little Happiness,"" but never shows up, he merely scares Rajpal Yadav's character into insanity) are hillarious running gags. Yes, there is a love triangle, but that is no reason to avoid the film as there are so many other cinematic elements to pay attention to.

Once I noticed Amazon Video had ""Hungama"" available free of cost, I decided to rewatch. It was certainly worth the second gander all these years later. I rarely try to watch movies a second time, but this ""fillum"" gave me such pleasant memories that I could not help but do so. The music is hummable, and maybe even worth getting the CD, if you are into Hindi film music. I don't mean to put down the stuff from nowadays, but the movie as a whole is a family-friendly tale, something that is increasingly harder to find as time goes by.",1464566400,,1342,4.568464730290456

2932771,5,B000V79RCO,"Easily one of the best written films out there. It's funny, enchanting, and the misunderstandings are beautiful.

Whoever wrote this was a genius! There are multiple storylines at the same time and each storyline is connected and well done. Many times in films the misunderstandings can get annoying, but here they all make sense, add to the humor and more.

My only complaint would be the ending doesn't tie up all of the loose ends, but it does leave to your imagination what happens, except for the love triangle which does get resolved (and I should note, it's one of the best love triangles I have ever seen).

I highly, highly recommend this movie, it's one of those that I tell everyone to watch in the Bollywood genre. I recommend it even to people who aren't in the culture and don't know the language - this is the type of humor that is universally understood and anyone can enjoy.",1458432000,,891,4.591194968553459
