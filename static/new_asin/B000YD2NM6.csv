There are 5 girls on Toraji's Kendo team and each of them have a fun and quirky personality. This is a feel good laugh a lot anime and it's sure to brighten your day.

The animation in this anime is good, and so is the voice acting. I can't call the soundtrack memorable, but it's not bad. There's nothing bad about this anime. I kinda wish they would make an OVA or a 2nd season to wrap it up, but it really doesn't need it. I just like to spoiled. Spoil yourself and buy Bamboo Blade.",1354492800,,618,4.15
