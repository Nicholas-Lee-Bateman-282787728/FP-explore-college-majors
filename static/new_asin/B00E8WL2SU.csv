Filmed over a number of years this is a solid, very sad documentary by the wildly talented Fatih Akin about the building of a garbage dump in the picturesque sea-side Turkish town of Camburnu, and how it slowly destroyed the town and its way of life.  Stories like this are nothing new, but Akins humanist approach makes us care by letting us get to know and like some of the crucial people of the town  like the mayor  who are fighting an uphill battle against the damage the lying and disinterested central government is wreaking on them.  These people are no rural rubes  they seem to know more about the law and even the engineering flaws of the dumps construction than the pathetic men who are supposed to be in charge.  Inspiring at times, depressing and defeating at others, its not the first film to show how greed and indifference is undermining our world, but its a strong and human example.",1489363200,,1041,4.625
