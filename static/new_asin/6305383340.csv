I reallywould like to get a hold of copy of this movie.  If anyone knows where I can get a copy, please lest me know, my handle is frogsitter and I get nessages sometimes through Amazon.  I will check back here occasionally.  Please!!!!!!!  I really think this is a good movie for the low buget they had to make it with and the cast is great.",1235865600,,517,4.12
7889288,3,6305383340,"I'm Bob Cook, yes, the writer & director of the film ""Lycanthrope.""  Although it's flattering to be mentioned with such famous werewolf movies as ""American Werewolf in London"" and it's sequel ""American Werewolf"" in Paris"" I didn't have the same millions of dollars to make ""Lycanthrope.""  This project was made for under $100,000.00.  Film students, and actual horror film fans will enjoy watching the problems a 'low budget' feature must endure when trying to compete with studios that spend twenty-five million plus.  Even ""Full Moon"" considered by most as a decent 'low budget' werewolf flick had almost ten million to complete the project.  If you're a real horror fan ""Lycanthrope"" will entertain you to the point where you'll wish we had more money.

Thank you,

Bob Cook

And with todays special effects and all the  talented writers out their I don't know why. The last good one was about  3yrs. ago called ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" that had great  effects and a good story. Since then their has been 1 called  ""Werewolf"" and the best thing I can say about that is that it  made for a great  MST-3000 episode. One of the funniest of that great show.  And now we get this.  I can't even begin to say how dumb it was.  Just  trust me,if you are a fan of werewolf movies don't bother with this,go rent  ""An American Werewolf in London"" or ""An American Werewolf in  Paris"" or ""Bad Moon."" That was a good one too, but avoid  this at all costs.",965174400,4,772,4.205479452054795
