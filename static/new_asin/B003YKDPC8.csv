8579643,1,B003YKDPC8,"This DVD does NOT include the finale of Schoenberg's Gurrelieder, with Klaus Maria Brandauer, contrary to Amazon's description. The total running time is 95 minutes, rather than the 113 minutes in the Amazon description. The credits at the end of the DVD include Klaus Maria Brandauer, but he is nowhere on this DVD.

Amazon UK lists this DVD with the same contents,including the Gurrelieder finale, but on the Arthaus label. I'll now try getting it from the UK. Obviously Kultur has the US rights to this program but chose not to include the Gurrelieder finale, which was the only reason I purchased it. Kultur has specialized for years in inferior picture and sound quality, and now they are deleting music as well.

NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KULTUR!!",1288051200,13,751,4.905511811023622
