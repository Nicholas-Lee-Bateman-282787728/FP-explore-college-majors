389432,5,6301945123,"I had not seen this DICEMAN video since the time it was on HBO! The fact that I remembered most of it shows how wild it was back in 1989! Sadly, many of the things that seemed funny back in those days would get most people fired from their jobs, sued, and blacklisted even if they told these jokes at a company party. Not surprisingly, DICE was sued and blacklisted by the National Organization for Women, which made a point of boycotting his shows and harassing any sponsors and advertisers of DICE. Thanks to the NOW setting the example, then DICE, Eddie Murphy, and others have been sued and harassed by various other groups when their comedy offended those folks. While DICE must have made a lot of money for the year or two that he was popular, you sure do not hear about him on TV at all, so he was effectively blacklisted. You also will probably never see this video on CABLE TV or any other mass forum. So if you want to see what comedy was before it became politically correct thanks to lawsuits and censorship, then you should buy this video. DICE was probably the last comedian who was truly a Neanderthal!",1036886400,16,1117,4.427184466019417
7818204,5,6301945123,"If your a fan of the Diceman then your going to love this stand up video. Dice is at his best here from story telling, nursery rhymes to flat out keeping the audience in stitches. Beware of the language and vulgarity humor though. If this isn't your cup of tea you may want to stay clear.",1398297600,,288,4.160714285714286
7818205,5,6301945123,"When we rented the VHS many years ago we laughed so hard that we almost died. It was great then, and it's great now. Stand-up comedy now seems to be dominated by so-so acts that come across as earnestly mean spirited. Dice was never that. He created a stage persona that was originally based on a collector he played in a movie, ""Sixteen Candles"" I think it was. After seeing this video, we got tickets to see him at the Schnitzer in Portland. He was great. If you've never skinny dipped in a public fountain, or streaked a graduation ceremony...take off your cloak of political correctness or suburban snobbery for just an hour, and immerse yourself in Dice's fantasy world. Don't question or judge it. Just laugh at it. When it's over you can go back to being your same old self, and kick the dog, twice. When is the DVD coming out? Something this good just can't be lost to the archives!",1333152000,,890,4.466257668711656
7818206,5,6301945123,"Saw this again while over at a friends house. He must be the last person in this country to not have followed the digital revolution. Its still as funny and offensive as ever but what I would have enjoyed even more would be a DVD release of this. As of now all of Andrew ""Dice"" Clay's material has all been released onto DVD with the notable exception of ""The Dice Man Cometh"". What I can not figure out  is why after al this time (22 years) is this release not on DVD? Its nuts, its insane but you would think by now after all this time some one would have asked the question, sweet mother of GOD, what the Hell is the hold up?  Its about fricking time that somebody get their collective act together and to release this show on DVD immediately if not sooner. maybe no one has hasn't even noticed but I for one would like to see a DVD release before I see a Blu-ray issue release of this show. So does anybody out there  have a clue as to why Andrew ""Dice"" Clay's arguably funniest release, The DIce Man Cometh has a yet to see the light of day on DVD yet?",1315872000,2,1057,4.096618357487923
7818207,3,6301945123,"Well, I enjoy raunchy, in your face humor, and remembered some ""Dice"", vaguely , and got a vhs copy, and watched and chuckled for about 20 minutes, but then, he blew it!
 SEE....... real humor is directed UPWARDS towards the elite. That's where TRUTH is. It's only funny if it's True! you know, we can laugh at Hitler, Palin, Bush, .....but when the Diceman began putting down homeless , poor people, the UNDERDOGS in society.....he BLEW it! Maybe that's why he is not BIG anymore. You know, ...right-wing ""humor"" is just not funny!
 The best humor pokes fun of the absurdities of life, the a-holes, the phoneys, the elite and powerful bass-turds , because humor is always based on truth! cosmic truth. But kicking the underdog, just is not funny. not that I'm against completely out of line trash -talk and funny haha stuff, like Carlin, or any other observers like Seinfeld, or even Michael Richards,and that's another story, and I excuse him for that , but......to attack the underdog is not just wrong, it's just plain NOT FUNNY! Othewrwise this video is very funny, in its own way , and is filmed well, and it IS Dice , and that's his shtick , and so I can't give this video a really bad review, but I think it's tragic, he did not study the history of humor a little bit more, and he could have been a contendah! blah!",1313280000,,1324,4.5125
7818208,3,6301945123,"i was a fan of this A-HOLE in high school, when my head was up my @ss and i didn't care about anybody or anything but myself!!! everything this jewish madman did to get himself blacklisted he eventually deserved! the only product i still have by him is ford fairlane.

even his shows ""bless this house"" and ""hits"" got canned so quickly as to make his wife ""trinny"" leave him and his own head spin. now he is a vegas late night side-show freak married to a brown chick named maria!

even his vh1 program from 2006 called dice rules only lasted one season and i missed the final episode featuring artie lange because i was a carlos ""mind of"" mencia fanatic! hell, i still own ""those"" dvds!

how many people realize this jerk, ripped-off same kinisons persona?
andrew ""diceman"" clay (aka andrew silverstein) lost his fans do to his never apologize attitude.",1303689600,,854,4.568627450980392
7818209,5,6301945123,"This is a replacement for my original tape that is wore slap out. Dice at his best. He's rude, crude and side splitting funny. You'll laugh your ass off.",1261526400,2,153,4.310344827586207
7818210,4,6301945123,"The Diceman WAS once upon a time the most outragous comedian I have ever experienced.  I watched this particular video once and could not laugh from the shock....then in the last few minutes of racist humour he gave his hand away and made us all aware that the ""Diceman"" is a characture for the modern day.  It is in fact a persona that even Andrew could not keep!  This is perhaps the greatest stand-up video of all time when you understand the cartoon!  Too bad he could not expand or stay in character for the long run!",1135123200,3,522,4.350515463917525
7818211,1,6301945123,"Yes, I'm aware of the incredibly inane pun that I constructed as a preamble to this review, but I am immediately cleared of any litigious action as a result of what the review entails.  In the pith of my sprightly youth, I can recollect a certain foul mouth cigarette smoking comedian clad in a black leather jacket whose invective laced stand-up material frequently incited long durations of unmitigated laughter betwixt me and a small coterie of friends (we had to clandestinely listen to his material because of parental opposition - the paranoia of being caught was tantamount to the ever approaching goosesteps of Gastapo in search of cowering young Jews).  Unanimously we would recite the ""dirty"" reworking of our favorite Mother Goose nursery rhymes and reiterate again and again, all of our favorite bits.  That comedian was the Dice Man, Andrew Dice Clay (whom up until a while ago, I assumed was a Wop such as myself - but word around the campfire speculates he's Jewish).  Anyway, Semitism has nothing to do with the poor quality of his routines.  Last week I was watching Collin Quin's Tough Crowd (for those unfamiliar with this program, it is similar to Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect, with the exception that the panel is comprised of comedians).  Much to my surprise, the Dice Man happened to be a guest on the show.  It was awkward because I had literally effaced any memory I had ever had of Andrew Dice Clay and his ""comedy"" act.  As I watched in bewilderment, he delivered one or two jokes that struck me as a relatively humorous.  I even began to recall some of those beloved quasi-rhymes the Dice Man had taught me at such an early age (""hickory dickory dock, some chick was suckin' my..."").  With this renewed interest in the Dice Man, I made a short jaunt to my local video store to acquire a stand-up tape featuring my childhood idol.  The video I rented was ""The Dice Man Cometh.""  Even the clerk at the register who so gracefully handled the transaction was amused by my selection (he told me the Dice Man was ""f-in' hilarious, ya know?"").  When I returned home and posited the cassette into the VCR, I knew I had made a fatal mistake.  One by one, any amorous remembrance or memory I had of this man being funny was competently dissimilated and torn to shreds.  I honestly had my jaw agape at how ludicrously far one man was willing to go to attain a few belly laughs.  Now, I am not for politically correct rhetoric by any stretch, but even this seemed too far for me.  I have no problem (and am actually quite humored) with comics who ridicule the ""appropriate"" lexicon of society, but it seemed as if the Dice Man spoke in such a manner because he wasn't aware of anything else.  Being outrageous for the sake of being outrageous is a far cry from commenting upon the colloquial gentrification of America, and comedians apt to utilize such humor usually fade out as their hype dissipates.  This case is true for Andrew Dice Clay.  If you're looking for smart commentary or even people who are actually funny, I recommend you try George Carlin, Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks, Richard Pryor, Nick Di Palo, even Paul Reiser is funnier than the Dice Man (and Paul Reiser is NOT funny).  Anyhow, I'm sure some will enjoy his ""daringly irreverent"" commentary...but some people enjoy bludgeoning themselves to sleep as well, which is exactly what Dice's humor compelled me to do.",1069372800,,3401,4.691919191919192
7818212,2,6301945123,"One of my friends absolutely adored Dice Clay once upon a time. I remember well the forced smile that I would wear as ""Little Miss Tuffet"" was played for the fiftieth time in as many minutes. He listened and laughed maniacally like a man possessed, but even he, one of Dice's biggest fans, has since seen the light. I no longer stand on the ceremony of a forced smile when I hear this silly little man's worn out antics.
It's not that I feel very strongly about the guy, it's just worth pointing out that he plain ain't funny. To label his comic style as ""school-yard humour"" would be an insult to school children everywhere.
Try Bill Hicks if you need to laugh at something slightly edgy. Andrew Dice Clay isn't edgy; he's mostly just rude, and a bit stupid if I'm to be absolutely honest.
Just to hammer my point home, there are two reviewers having a go at eachother on this page and I reckon the dispute gives a pretty good idea of the sort of person that Clay attracts. One fellow described this video as ""no holes barred"". The other reviewer replied by correcting his mistake, but then called him a jackass with only one 's'...You surely catch my drift.",1069286400,,1159,4.446009389671362
7818213,3,6301945123,"I--both wittingly and unwittingly--have watched about 4 Andrew Dice Clay standup videos.  This 1989 HBO comedy special filmed live in Philadelphia before a rowdy crowd of mullet-wearing jokels is his best, which isn't to say it's without its flaws.
Andrew Clay Silverstein (Dice's real name) rose to the top of the comedy heap by telling hilariously tasteless jokes on women, sex, and--of course--dirty nursery rhymes.  While he wasn't the best comic of the 1980s comedy boom (Sam Kinison, Eddie Murphy, and Jim Carrey were all funnier) Dice is consistently funny when he sticks to these well worn topics.  He earned the undying hatred of women's groups everywhere, but he became a millionaire in the process.  Needless to say, I don't think you'll quickly climb the corporate ladder by reciting these jokes at work, but they are frequently hilarious.
I demoted Mr. Silverstein 2 stars, however, because this video has its weak spots.  The painfully slow 5 minute introductory sketches illustrate that sketch comedy just isn't Dice's thing.  Kindly fast forward through it.  Furthermore, some of his jokes about African Americans, Asians, and Arabs are just flat out racist.  I didn't find myself (or anyone else I was watching it with) laughing.
Anyhoo, for a has-been, Dice is a pretty successful one.  He performs at Bally's in Las Vegas and pulls in 7 figures telling the same dirty nursery rhymes that you'll see here.  If you want to save yourself the $60+ to purchase a seat at one of his shows (in addition to the cost of going to Vegas), then get this video.  Otherwise, enjoy his live show...just don't sit in the front!",1047772800,4,1630,4.934065934065934
