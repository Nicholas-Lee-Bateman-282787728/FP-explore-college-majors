2797222,5,B000OLAITI,"I just got my tae bo amped workout about two weeks ago and I can already see some improvements in how I look. I would suggest to people who are wanting to try tae bo for the first time to do the boot camp workout series, it is a little bit slower and easier to pick up on the different moves and will prepare you for the amped workout. Just be patient with yourself, do tae bo and eat right and you will see some positive results!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BILLY-BLANKS-BILLY-S-BOOT-CAMP/dp/B000S9UZXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BILLY BLANKS:BILLY'S BOOT CAMP</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Blanks-Tae-Bo-Amped-with-Amplifier-Bar-Workout-Kit-5-DVD-s-by-Gaiam/dp/B001TK0L4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Blanks Tae Bo Amped with Amplifier Bar Workout Kit - 5 DVD's - by Gaiam</a>",1241136000,3,872,6.864864864864865
2797223,5,B000OLAITI,"I have the original tae bo advance, billys boot camp and now Billy Blanks -Tae Bo - Amped Full Throttle.
If you are serious about reaching your goals add this to your routine. This is a very good cardio that really hits the upper body very hard. This is exactly what I need. Billy is the best, he really gives me the strength to go on. I love when he comes up to the screen and talk to me. Some people say he talks too much but that is his way of pushing us along and I love that about him. He never forget about the people at home.",1238371200,9,532,3.889908256880734
2797224,5,B000OLAITI,"I have used Taebo Amped series for the past 6 months and Full Throttle is by far the most intense.  On the days when I'm sore, Full Throttle gives you a great workout without using the bar.  If you are up for the challenge, use Full Throttle in the morning and in the evening try Taebo Rock -n- Abs - you will definitely see results!  This is an intense video not for beginners in my opinion.",1236211200,13,392,4.131578947368421
2797225,4,B000OLAITI,"I totally enjoyed this work out it focus's mainly on the upper body, Billy uses a new tool called a amped bar that is adjustable. But you don't need this extra tool to participate in the exercise it's high impact and you will be exposed to a whole new set of moves.",1234396800,,265,4.115384615384615
2797226,5,B000OLAITI,"I did this in the morning without the ""stick"" and still felt the result in the evening same day! I like it when the warm up and cool down time are minimized with the majority of the time being the actual workout.

Billy used a combination of cardio and strength moves during the 55 minutes workout. It is really great to start the day with an energtic workout!

In addition, Billy has been so considerate to divide the class into those working out with the ""stick"" and those without using the ""stick"" so we could choose to follow whichever suits our level and conditions.

Another wonderful workout!",1230508800,10,599,4.579439252336448
2797227,5,B000OLAITI,I have been a taebo fan for 5 years and these great workout video's. you sweat from start to finish I would recommend these to anyone,1227398400,,133,4.153846153846154
2797228,5,B000OLAITI,"I have been doing Tae Bo and trying to lose weight for about 8 months. I tried The Power Within, then I moved up to The Strength within (All titles by Billy Blanks). Eventually, my body stopped losing weight, and I had to then begin even more vigorous and challenging workouts. That's when I purchased the whole Amped series. I started from Jump Start Cardio to Fat Burn Accelerator, and then Full Throttle (Full Throttle being the most intense). One I began including Full Throttle in my every day regimen, I noticed a difference right away. I lost 18 pounds in 2 weeks, but I lost a total of 110 pounds since I first started doing Tae Bo in January 2008. I was very amazed. Although it is very intense, and all of the moves are non-stop high-impact, but it's worth the money because you will definitely lose weight quickly. For those of you that desire rapid and ongoing weight loss, and want to keep it off, I suggest you get this video because if you do it faithfully, you will definitely see results.",1224115200,16,1005,4.467391304347826
2797229,4,B000OLAITI,"I got this workout after watching an infomercial for it late one night (I usually NEVER order from infomercials, but I'm a Billy Blanks fan).  Just received it Friday, and did the Fat Burn Accelerator and the Core Express, and I LOVE them!  Like another person rating this, my bar seems like it doesn't lock right on one side, so I'm gonna call on Tuesday and see if I can get another one.  Overall, GREAT!!!",1188691200,4,408,4.413333333333333
2797230,4,B000OLAITI,"I ordered this online at Billy Blanks's webpage to add to my ever-growing Tae Bo webpage. I haven't done all of the workouts yet -- there are a lot here! -- but I have done enough of them to know that this is a worthy workout. It's not as difficult as his workouts with the Billy Bands (Bootcamp, Bootcamp Elite, Total Body Fat Blaster, Fat-Blasting Cardio), but I am still very sore when I wake up the next day.
I normally do not find Shellie annoying (as I've read some people find her), but here I do have to make an exception. Julieanne works out silently (besides counting) but in the Jump-Start Cardio, for example, Shellie is screaming out like she's being tortured every two minutes. It's annoying that I'm in better physical condition than her -- and I've only been doing Tae Bo for a few months now! I realize that she's just bouncing back from having a baby (notice that her stomach bulges out now), but maybe if she's still getting back into shape, she should be in the back with AJ and Bridget instead of in the front with Billy and Julieanne. I don't mean to sound harsh -- I really do like Shellie, especially in the previous workouts -- but it's disconcerting to hear her call out to the Lord every 2 minutes for strength (especially since nobody else in the video is experiencing that degree of pain). But in ""Fat Burn Accelerator"" Shellie doesn't use the Amplifier and seems to be having a better time of things, and I really enjoyed that workout.
Still, I give it 4 stars because it will give you an awesome workout. The Tae Bo ""Rockin' Buns"" (not included here but it also uses the Amplifier) is really hard-core, working muscles in my [...] that I didn't know I had!",1178668800,15,1687,4.445161290322581

Billy blanks is so motivational and make you feel like you are the only person in the room working out. He encourages yet pushes you to be all you can be in life. You can feel the love through the cd that it's just not a temporary moment in your to lose the extra weight but its a lifestyle. H and team do a phenomenal job.

2797256,2,B000OLAITI,"I guess I did not realize how much of an upper body workout this dvd was..I already strength train enough, I just wanted an extra taebo dvd to mix with my other one. I barely got a high heartrate on this and when I did, the moves barely lasted. I in fact will be donating this today and just checking into his other dvds. This really is just lifting weights (or your arm) and that's it. I was so bored.",1402099200,,402,4.0375
2797257,1,B000OLAITI,"I received the disks,  but not the stick-weight (bar), making it an incomplete purchase. The system was based on the weighted bar (amped.) Thus, unable to properly rate the product. Thus far, it has been a waste of my Timor and money.",1401321600,,234,4.571428571428571
2797258,5,B000OLAITI,"Something must be said about all Billy Blanks workout DVDs...He is so fun to workout to! Billy Blanks energy is infectious, and this one is no exception. I also have the P90X series, and the workouts lack that excitement, that militant shouting, that ""in your face"" attitude. I give up on P90X because of this alone. This Amped workout is mostly upper-body; that said, if you get yourself a weighted bar (I use a 6 lb weight bar), this workout is an INCREDIBLE upper body challenge. I used to do a very similar class at a gym, and using that bar helped sculpt my upper body quickly, and we only used the weighted bar for a portion of the workout. I can't imagine the results I'll see using it the whole time! I found myself sweating all over and getting to a point I just had to give my muscles a quick rest.  Some routines move very fast, and I just could not move my muscles that quickly, so I just went at a speed I could manage. If you try this and find it to be too challenging, my advice...don't give up! Just do what you can! But if you want assurance you'll see good results with this DVD, oh my, yes you will!",1399939200,3,1118,4.2
2797259,4,B000OLAITI,I really enjoy doing this workout.  I am just a little disappointed that it did not come with the bar.  I use weighted gloves in place of it and they do the trick.,1398988800,,163,3.909090909090909
2797260,5,B000OLAITI,I have bought three of BB's DVDs to complement  and change the routines and get a complete work out. I have lost inches and it helps so that my body doesn't get used to the same exercises. I recommend this DVD for fat burn.,1398384000,,223,4.068181818181818

2797262,5,B000OLAITI,I love this dvd. I used the Amped Up before I had my son and dropped 25 lbs. and now that I am in the final stretch of my weight loss post baby (down 80lbs so far) I was eager to return to Billy Blanks.

I've been searching for one, and no one seems to have one (Tae Bo's website is under construction).  Even without the Amplifier, I find the workout to be amazing.  My abs, arms and butt feel fantastic when it is done.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that loves Tae Bo and wants to be challenged.",1363737600,,456,4.445783132530121
2797271,5,B000OLAITI,I'm still getting used to taebo again. I stared when taebo first came out and fell in love. Lost. around 40 to 50 pounds. Quit doing it and gained the weight back plus more. Decided to jump back in and strafed following a good diet and doing taebo 5 to 6 days a week for the last couple month dropped 26 pounds already.  I did this workout...found on youtube. I usually test the workouts there before I buy. Ive added this o e to my rotation of workouts. I love Billy and these workouts. I cant say how many times ive felt I couldn't finish a workout and hes said 'don't quit...keep going.' It does help me. He always seems to say it right when I'm struggling. 90% of the time I push my way thru. My opinion on the complaints that the videos are in poor production...it doesn't bother me. I'm there for the workout. I don't care what the set or whatever looks like. The music is never an issue for me either. Most of the time I'm focused on doing the moves right and getting the best workout I can to pay that close attention to it. And Shelly...she doesn't bother me either. Sometimes om yelling along with her. She motivates me as well at times.  I love these workouts cuz they're fun and hard. They pushed me and those are my favorite types of workouts. If I'm not sweating and challenged I don't consider it a good workout and taebo does both. I also love feeling great when I finish a workout. You do feel great cuz you pushed hour way thru and acgomplished it.,1360886400,7,1466,4.250896057347671

My husband is in the military, he said this workout made him break a sweat but didn't feel it in his muscles, so my advice is if you are already in ready great, toned shape, this workout will feel more like just a cardio and may not be worth it for you.

2797280,4,B000OLAITI,"I'll start off by explaining that I have 12 Billy Blanks Tae Bo DVDs. I'm 64 and have had Tae Bo as part of my routines ever since Billy brought out  on videotape the original Tae Bo routines. This is my third AMPED DVD. I primarily use the AMPED DVD's when I don't really feel like doing a heavy-duty workout. That's primarily because I don't get anywhere close to a heavy-duty workout when I use them. So essentially I use them when I want to take a small break during the week.

There are many irritating things that Billy does in all of the DVDs that he has produced, and for me it's a matter of trying to ignore them as much as possible while still wishing that they had been done a little more professionally. In one of them for example he needs to adjust his resistance bands, and so he leaves it up to his daughter Shelly to keep the class moving, rather than to have somebody spend a short amount of time it would take to edit out that part. If you listen to enough of these DVDs, you'll get the impression that there is no editing that is done.

This amateurish editing reminds me of a $.25 porno flic. (I admit that I have seen one of them, and that was enough for me) What I mean by that is that in those disgusting flic's the camera is turned on, and directions are given by someone off screen, and when it's done they shut off the camera and that's how the performance will be presented. No editing. Everything that happens, even when the performers are looking at the director for instructions, is left on the video. Very little difference with Billy Blanks Tae Bo DVD's. There seems to be no editing that has been done at all, and that is very irritating.

One of the other things that is irritating about this series of DVDs, is that Shelly, who is Billy's Daughter by marriage, not biologically, never seems to be content to just do the counting and tries to get the spotlight on herself whenever possible, and she definitely wants you to know that she is his daughter. If you were not aware that she was his daughter, in this particular DVD, she reminds you four or five times by calling him dad or daddy.

I also get annoyed because Billy does have a penchant for showing off a bit, when it is really not necessary, or appropriate, and usually they add nothing to the routine. In this particular DVD, for some unknown reason, he feels it necessary to demonstrate a particular maneuver for approximately 20 seconds. I have no problems with him demonstrating the proper ways to do things, but this particular maneuver has a difficulty rating equal to that of picking your nose. One or two seconds would have been plenty.

I obviously like doing the routine's, or I certainly wouldn't have continued doing them for this long. It's just that it would be so much better if these DVDs were presented in a way that doesn't remind you of the professionalism that you see in your four-year-old daughter's dance recitals.",1339027200,,2931,4.4487895716946

I have about 10 different Tae Bo videos that I switch between so I don't get bored, and I'd say Amped Full Throttle and Ripped Extreme are my favorites. I like how they both incorporate weights, so I am seeing results in my arms, a difficult area for me. I don't have the bar for Amped, but I just use light weights, and it works just as well.

This workout will not give you a high heartrate and cardio results.  It will, however, give you a decent full-body workout.  I suggest weighted gloves if you have them.

2797288,3,B000OLAITI,"Although this DVD is called 'Jump Start CARDIO,' there is barely any cardio involved in the workout.  Almost all of the short, 40 minute (in reality it's more like 30 minutes) workout focused on arms.  It is not a bad workout; it just doesn't focus on what it claims to.  There is also too much down-time where everyone is just walking in place, and the Amplifier Bar just makes the moves more complicated and difficult to do.  I prefer doing the majority of the moves with one- or two-pound free weights.  The bar also is poorly manufactured and frequently (and I mean VERY frequently) comes unlocked.  Overall, it was a good--but short-- workout that got me sweating.  I was just a little put off by the fact that it focused more arms than cardio.",1319068800,,749,4.544776119402985

When you buy this set, you get five workouts on four DVDs and the Amplifier sculpting bar. A great training  tool. You feel the burn, sweat fast and be energized at the end. I give this set five stars.

2797293,4,B000OLAITI,I really like the amped workouts.  When you first start out you reallllly need to start with Jumpstart cardio.  I think I about died the first time I did it (when I was out of shape).  But now that I'm more in shape I love it.  My favorite is Full Throttle.  Billy does get off count a lot and does more reps on one side than the other a bit; but I don't mind too much mainly because I use these workouts as cardio and endurance.  Even without the bar you get a great workout. I'd definitely recommend it.,1313712000,2,505,4.05050505050505

I still love them but know the routines and songs by heart.  I usually work out at the gym 4-5 times a week but with the harsh PA winter and sick kids, I have been stuck at home a lot lately instead of the gym.  So I was forced to find another Billy Blanks DVD.  The amplifier is easy to get used to, it is probably no more than 2 pounds but it really takes your workout to the next level!  I was out of breath for most of the Full Throttle video, and after completing it, my arms and shoulders feel the effect of the amplifier.  He is really the best to use for at-home fitness.

2797300,5,B000OLAITI,"Reminds me of the kickboxing classes I took a few years ago. I let myself get kind of out of shape...ok. 30 pounds out of whack. UGH!!! And so now I needed something to kick my ass back into shape.

I was looking around and found this DVD.

I started the work out 2 days ago and am still a bit sore but it's a GOOD soreness, know what I mean?

I can't quite keep up 100% with the workout right now...but I do get through it (groaning and grunting, Oh My God! Those lunge exercises...holy crap!) and I feel so GREAT afterwards.

Billy Blanks keeps you motivated. Never gets cheesy like some workout video people do. He keeps it real and the people he's working out with also really make you want to work just as hard.

I LOVE the fact that it's recorded in real time...so you see them all sweat right along with you, and one of them even grunts too. Ha ha. Love it!

I'd highly recommend this video if you want a GOOD REAL workout, want to sweat like mad and want to feel energized afterwards.

This is GOOD STUFF!!!!!!!!

(and you don't need the stick. I use a stick I found in my garage (have no idea what it came from. looks like it was a leg off some kind of camping gear?) Anyhow, what's also cool about the video is that there is a set of people using the stick and another set not using it. So, you don't have to use one if you don't want to.

I switch between using one and not. Makes the workout more interesting that way.",1289088000,5,1430,4.096774193548387
2797301,3,B000OLAITI,"I was looking for a workout that would compare to P90X's Kenpo X workout.  This DVD did not measure up.  I put 20 minutes into the DVD, and my heart rate peaked at 80% of max and the average was less than 65%, and that was after I strapped on 2.5 lb weights on each wrist to duplicate the single 3 lb bar used in the DVD.  In addition, even though I watched the instructional section, there was foot work in the DVD not covered in the instructions.  I gave it a 3 because if you are looking for less intense workouts, this would probably be good, but if you are used to Insanity and P90X, don't bother.",1289088000,3,602,4.076271186440678

2797303,5,B000OLAITI,Tae Bo is a great fat burner. The workouts help you burn fat while putting your body in good physical condition. In a week you can start seeing results and the first day start to feel lighter and healthier. Do not forget to try to follow this challenge with a healthy diet and drink water regularly. If you do lots of exercise routine you should start slowly because you could end up very tired and not wanting to continue the challenge.,1278633600,10,437,4.407407407407407

2797306,4,B000OLAITI,"I have been doing TaeBo since the very first video came out around 1998 and I love it! I can honestly tell anyone that if I do TaeBo consistently, 4 days a week for 3 weeks, I see results! I lose inches from my waist, I burn fat and gain muscle and look very toned. I haven't encountered a workout yet that yields the same results as fast as TaeBo. I stop sometimes and go back to it because I know it works. I have just lost 35lbs after having a baby and needed to tightened it all back up, so I have been doing this Fat Burn Accelerator 4 times a week for the past 2 weeks and I'm already seeing and FEELING the difference. If you haven't experienced TaeBo before, you will find it difficult because of its intensity, speed and moves but its just like making love for the first time, it's uncomfortable and awkward at first, you get sweaty and there is lots of heavy breathing! But you have to practice and be consistent and you become a pro at it!  If you are a beginner, start off with the basic workout and work your way up. For me, I love fast and intense cardio. I feel like I've done something when I am dripping with sweat. This DVD goes by pretty fast to me. You've done 30 minutes before you know it. This DVD does exactly what it says, it will burn the fat.",1265760000,31,1269,4.096385542168675
2797307,3,B000OLAITI,"First, I must say I bought this at Target for only $7.  Because ten years ago I had the original Tae Bo vhs tapes and I loved them. For months I have been doing all of Jillian Michael's workouts and I love them and I have gotten results, but I'm getting bored.  So I picked this up for something different to do along with hers, and since I have done Tae Bo in the past.  Well I don't know if I am just in better shape since doing Jillian's dvds, or if this workout is just rather slow.  Either way, I wasn't impressed. I know for a fact my heartrate was NOT up as it should be. It was an okay workout, but I know that it wasn't enough for me. This dvd would probably be alright for beginners and people new to exercise.  And I'm sure it would be great for those with serious knee problems who can't do a lot of jumping.

Sorry, but this did not impress me at all.  I had to add Jillian's ten minute workout from the Biggest Loser Cardio Max to it, and even that ten minutes is harder than this hour long dvd. I still think Tae Bo is great, and I think Billy Blanks can be very inspirational, but this particular workout wasn't cutting it for me. Just glad I only spent $7 on it!

PS: Don't bother buying that bar thingy. You don't need it.  Or you could just use something around the house like a baseball bat or something else.",1263081600,2,1329,4.061302681992337
2797308,5,B000OLAITI,"Must say that I hesitated to get another Taebo set, thinking this was just a gimmick.  Let me say that I changed my mind.  I bought the workouts without the amplifier.  I wish I had it, but improvised by using a homemade bar with weighted gloves.  It was almost the same.  The bar made the familiar moves unusually effective.  I felt like I was doing martial arts during portions of the workout.  That was gratifying to me.

I had double knee replacement about 3 months ago and found having a bar very convenient to help support me while I regain my muscle stregth.  I did modify a few moves to keep from putting too much stress on my knees, but was very happy with the level of the workout.  I was dripping with sweat at times, so I had fun.
