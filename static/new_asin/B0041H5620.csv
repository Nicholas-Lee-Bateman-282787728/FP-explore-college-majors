4242824,5,B0041H5620,"Over the years, I have bought several DVDs containing cartoon assortments---collecting VHS and DVD cartoon collections is one of my hobbies, and I like this DVD cartoon assortment very much because it contains many cartoons of different varieties and because the cartoons seemed to have been selected for their interesting storylines-- and were not just bunched together without regard for their basic quality.  I have bought cartoon assortments, which contained a great many cartoons, which were either very boring or very poorly produced.  I have found this DVD selection, however, to contain a great many cartoons well worth watching.  I have to agree with the 4-year-old daughter of a previous reviewer of this DVD:  the little lady knows a good cartoon when she sees one.  :)",1384300800,3,780,5.158730158730159
4242825,1,B0041H5620,"I thought this was a great deal for only $5, and so I could overlook the shoddy menu and format that the reviewer above mentions. But what I cannot get over is the shortening of some of the episodes. Looking for some childhood nostalgia, I decided to buy this DVD. Upon seeing one of my favorite Popeye episodes in the list of cartoons I chose to play it. The episode itself is 17 minutes long. The version on this DVD, however, was only about 8 minutes long. They cut more than half of the episode from this DVD. You can go on youtube and watch the entire episode. Although this DVD is very cheap, the quality and effort put into the making of it is definitely subpar.",1355184000,2,669,4.275590551181103
4242826,1,B0041H5620,"The image and sound quality are not the best but that's what you get with a (less than) $5 DVD.
I can get past that part because my daughter doesn't seem to mind,
what I CAN'T get past is the fact that there is no menu of any sorts.
270 cartoons and no way to tell in what order they appear, so if your child
wants to watch a specific cartoon, you must click ""next"" an unknown number of times until you find it!
My daughter (who is 4) really likes most of the cartoons on here, so perhaps some day I'll get REALLY
ambitions (or bored) and type up my own list of the cartoons so I know where to find them.
If I do, I'll be sure and post the list here.",1338681600,5,650,3.8582089552238807
