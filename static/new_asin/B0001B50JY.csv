8009496,5,B0001B50JY,"If you love trains, you'll enjoy this DVD.  Take a ride on Amtrak's ""California Zephyr"" from Denver to Glenwood Springs on Union Pacific's former Denver & Rio Grande Western main line and ""Burlington Zephyr"" route.  This three-disc set allows you to experience the entire trip from the locomotive crew's point of view.

Many railroaders, passengers and railfans consider the California Zephyr to be Amtrak's most scenic route.  This program will take you on a scenic trip through the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies, along the Colorado River, through Moffat Tunnel and Glenwood Canyon, eventually arriving at the historic train station at Glenwood Springs.

There is very little narration in this program; instead, you'll hear the crew conversing and the radio squaking as the dispatcher talks to them and other crews on the line.  You'll see scenery that cannot be viewed from a highway.  In short, this program will give you a taste of what it is like to be a locomotive engineer or conductor.

Those who have only a casual interest in railroads may find this program boring, even with the unique scenery offered.  For those who are confirmed railroad buffs (railfans), you'll thoroughly enjoy this DVD as it offers everything a railfan has ever wanted to experience from the cab of a locomotive, including railroad operations.  A must for any railfan's collection!",1127692800,14,1371,5.080357142857143
