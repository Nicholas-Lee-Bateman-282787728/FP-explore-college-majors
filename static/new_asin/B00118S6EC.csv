8241045,3,B00118S6EC,"When Hurricane Katrina pummeled New Orleans, some residents were airlifted to other temporary locations.  One of these locations was Utah, where hundreds of African- Americans found themselves (surprise!).  This movie, Desert Bayou, portrays the interactions of these refuges with Utah demographics, culture, religion, and climate.  Although it started off with a focus on the refugees moving to a state where less than 1% of the population is Black, it eventually moved into a criticism of the LDS faith and issues of racism.  However, if you look deeper, you will note that this is really a movie about a few families, their fears, hopes, and dreams of rebuilding their lives.

A few people decided to remain in Utah.  The film features them visiting New Orleans in 2006, and they speak disparagingly of New Orleans.  But some decide to return, while others stay in Utah.

I felt the film pushed too hard to try to uncover some devious plot against these refugees in Utah.  However, it is also important to recognize that Utah is full of ""peculiar people.""

I hope all of the refugees find peace and goodness wherever they end up.  I hope the 100 or so of the refugees remaining in Utah help the state develop a ""melting pot"" philosophy.  And I hope we can work to minimize the impacts of all natural disasters.  I am afraid they will be getting worse.",1364428800,,1354,4.7844827586206895

8241047,1,B00118S6EC,"I'm not sure which is more racist: Utahn's attitudes towards African-Americans - as portrayed by this movie -- or the writer's and director's attitude toward Utahns.

Steeped in hyperbole, shallow analysis and contradiction, the writer and director do little to hide an agenda -- prejudices that get in the way of a great human interest story that has much potential. For example, they choose to portray Utah -- the whole state mind you -- as an ""isolated community"" that is ""repressive,"" and that falls into a ""community panic"" when 600 Katrina refugees arrive. The refugees stay in temporary housing on a military installation where the refugees lived ""far from civilization."" The movie-makers choose all kinds of forboding music and repeated cutaways to portray Utahns as scowling and militant. I have a difficult time imagining what more these film-makers could have done to create a steeper caricature.

They also highlight a Rabbi to explain Mormonism, in attempts to provide some context as to why Utahns ""build a wall around"" themselves. (To remain consistent in their investigations, when they do a film that has anything to do with Judiasm, they should rely on a Mormon to interpret Hebrew history for the audience.) Unfortunately, the Rabbi as edited either gets aspects of Mormon history either wrong or incomplete at best. For example, he says LDS founder Joseph Smith was an anti-abolitionist. Well, not really. Smith was never a fire-in-the-belly abolitionist. But he believed and taught slavery was wrong, to include a 1844 presidential platform that would have emanicipated slaves by purchasing their freedom with funds used by sale of federal lands.  And the movie-makers fail to discuss the complex question of race relations in Mormon history, the significance in Mormon culture of priesthood ordination, and whether the Mormon church had race relations inconsitent -- and if so, how -- from most Protestant churches at different points in history since the 1830s.  Were these nueanced realities too much for these film-makers? I don't think so. But these film-makers seem to have an agenda that impedes thier story-telling (not so uncommon of a problem with inexperienced artists.)

Then about 50 minutes into the film, all of the sudden Utahns reach out, get folks housing, gift cards, and help to settle into the Salt Lake City area for those folks who want to stay. And evacuees are calling Utah ""the land of milk and honey."" Wha- What?  The film-makers fail to show how all these supposedly racist, suspicious, and exclusionary Utahns could have such an effect. If it's such a bad place for African-Americans, why are these folks staying?
But the good times are short-lived -- maybe 3 minutes at the most in the movie.  In the next segment, the two fellows who the film-makers follow most closely, these guys fall onto hard times. It seems that the greatest barriers to getting jobs, even by these fellows' own admission, is lack of education, prior criminal convictions, and drug problems. Carrying this kind of baggage makes it hard to get a job anywhere, not just Utah. Back in NO,LA pre-Katrina, they say in the movie they were just getting by and living in border-line poverty, if not deep in poverty.

It seems the facts (as opposed to the innuendos) portrayed in this movie address less the cultural difficulties of moving to Utah from NO,LA, or about being African-American in Utah; but more about poverty in general, and how difficult a road a person has to pick themselves up out of a culture of economic poverty when that's what they've known for their life.  For a good discussion about this issue of working to get folks out of poverty, particularly African-Americans, I recommend reading about Geoffery Canada and the Harlem Children's Zone.

I'm left to wonder: Why are the protagonists going back to Utah, calling themselves ""Utahns,"" even after returning to NO,LA for Mardi Gras? The film-makers go to long lengths to portray NO,LA as happy, carefree, with extensive supportive networks for the Katrina refugees. But the film-makers never take time to explain why NO,LA -- or anywhere in LA -- isn't the place where the protagonists want to settle down, and why they would still choose to live in Utah rather than return to NO.",1351900800,2,4269,5.016949152542373
8241048,5,B00118S6EC,"I am a little biased because one of my best friends helped with the making of the film, but I think it is a well made film. It follows several different people, families whom are effected by Hurricane Katrina through out the film. The film is done in a way that by the end you find yourself wondering what happened and rooting for the people highlighted in the film. It also helped me see and learn first hand more about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on people.",1241395200,,464,4.344827586206897
