He was very funny in this movie and he has done many movies and also he is a very good wrestler and a good general manager for TNA and his movies are very great. I would say thank you very much for sending me this tape and I would say keep up the good work and earn the cash. Sincerely yours, Zaida M Quijano.",1347667200,,442,3.7127659574468086

7796320,1,1562020226,"This movie stinks. This makes Jingle All The Way look lik Miracle on 34th street(both the 1947 one & the 1994 one). The acting is hammy & horrible. The Villians are laughable. The Storyline is Cliched. Worst of all,it has too many plotholes like ""How come the kids in the orphanage still belive Hogan is Santa even though his fake beard fell off?"". I give this movie a 0 out of 10.",1280793600,,381,4.305555555555555
7796321,1,1562020226,"this is with out a doubt the worst hulk hogan movie ever made, and i am a hogan fan.  This movie should be erased from society.  the other 2 reviews that gave 5 stars saying it was awesome are ether from Hogan, someone who works for Hogan, or Bubba the Love Sponge.  the movie is garbage and no one should have to pay any amount of money to see it. the only reason why i am giving this movie a 1 star is because amazon won't let me post it with zero stars.",1231113600,3,456,3.881720430107527
7796322,1,1562020226,"What in the world was Hulk Hogan thinking when he signed on to this piece of cr@p?? 'Santa With Muscles' features the mad original 'plot' of an evil millionaire (Hogan) who gets amnesia and then thinks he is Santa Claus. The 'film' continues on as ""Santa With Muscles"" defeats the evil Ed Beagley Jr. saving the local orphanage from being taken over and no doubt turned into a mini mall or condo development.

I assume that this movie was made for kids but I don't see how any kids or any humans could truly enjoy this waste of film. It blows my mind that this movie was released in the movie theaters and that anyone could even admit to seeing this. About the only 'worthwhile' reason to watch this movie is to see future 'That 70s Show' Mila Kunis in one of her first roles but even that is a stretch.

Hard to even recommend for a 'Bad Movie Night', 'Santa With Mucles' is a cr@pburger served with a warm diet coke and cold fries.
