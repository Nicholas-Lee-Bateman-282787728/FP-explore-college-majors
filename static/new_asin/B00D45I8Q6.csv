8589388,5,B00D45I8Q6,"Sometimes it feels like there is nothing new in horror movies -- we just get remakes, sequels, and movies that rely more on gore and nudity than real horror.

But sometimes... very occasionally, we get a movie like ""Mama."" This is the closest we're probably going to get to a ""La Llorona: The Movie"" -- an eerie, creeping brand of horror that quietly slips behind you instead of leaping out of dark corners with a screech. And it doesn't hurt that the acting is pretty uniformly brilliant in this movie, even if Jessica Chastain's character arc is a bit predictable.

After murdering his wife and business partner, a distraught man named Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) escapes to a cabin in the woods with his two very young daughters. He plans to kill them and then himself, but something destroys him before he has a chance.

Five years later, the girls are found -- feral and naked, except for wreaths of flowers. Their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau again) immediately volunteers to care for them, although his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) is a little more reluctant. Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) supports their custody claim and even gives them a McMansion to live in, as long as he has access to the girls.

But something strange is afoot -- nightmares, moths and tales of someone the girls call ""Mama."" After Lucas takes a near-fatal fall down the stairs, both Annabel and Dreyfuss begin to suspect that ""Mama"" is not just a coping mechanism, but something that spent years raising the girls in the woods. And she won't let anyone else take care of ""her"" children.

It really annoys me when people insist that ""PG-13 horror always sucks!"" -- if it's done with atmosphere and skill, it doesn't need an R-rating or a big budget. ""Mama"" doesn't have a lot of jump scares or grotesque images -- it relies instead on a creeping sense of unease, draped in shadows, fluttering moths, dead leaves and sepia-toned decay.

Andres Muschietti has never directed a full-length movie before, but frankly I'm dying to see what he comes up with next. He already has a lot of skill, such as the beautiful scene where we first glimpse Mama in the house -- a single shot of Lily playing with someone, as Victoria and Annabel drift in and out of other rooms. It's a quiet, unmoving shot, but we're left with the growing horror of knowing that SOMETHING unknown is in that room with a little child.

And the horror really amps up when we finally DO see Mama. She's a twisted, shadowy creature with scuttling limbs and windblown hair, but she also elicits our pity for her madness and sorrow. She's a classic ghost, and every attack makes perfect sense.

It also has some truly excellent acting from, well, EVERYONE. Coster-Waldau is absolutely heartbreaking as a man desperately devoted to his family, and willing to give up everything for his brother's children. Chastain also gives an excellent performance as Annabel, slowly warming up to the children as she slowly becomes aware that something supernatural is creeping into her new suburban life. The one problem: her transition from ""rock chick who doesn't want kids"" to ""loving aunt"" never feels quite natural.

And Megan Charpentier and Isabelle N&eacute;lisse... wow. Both of them are absolutely brilliant, which is all the more impressive because they're so young. They give beautifully nuanced performances, especially since they have to act like feral children for awhile. Wow. Like the director, watch these children.

""Mama"" is the kind of horror movie that deserves to be a classic -- a dark, twisting story that relies entirely on the most classic kind of ghost there is. Definitely a must-see, even for people who aren't a big fan of horror.",1377648000,,3705,4.866666666666666
