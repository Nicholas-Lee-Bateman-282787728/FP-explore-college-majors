I have since seen the royal ballet twice in person, so great was the impression it made on me. I searched for  years for a video of it, it made my heart sing so. Now I have a very avid  budding ballerina daughter and a nature loving son so I consider it a  neccessity *and* a priviledge to own it. No child, ballet dancer or not,  should be without it.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Beatrix Potter [1866-1943] is a much-loved childrens author. Beatrix Potter grew up rural England. Her father was a reasonably well-off solicitor but Beatrix appeared to have not had a happy childhood and being forced to work as her parents housekeeper and discouraged from pursuing her interest in botany at university, which refused to enrol her because she was a woman. She developed a great love of small animals and of the countryside of Britains Lake District, later buying a farm and much land in the area, leaving it to the National Trust upon her death. It was this love of small animals, which she would smuggle into the house to be her playmates as a child that led to her stories. These all centre around various talking rabbits, ducks, cats, mice and the like. Initially these stories were only written for the amusement of friends and their children but the friends then inspired her to publish. The first of Beatrix Potters books was The Tale of Peter Rabbit [1902], which she initially published by private press after it was rejected by publishers. This was then taken up by a publisher and enjoyed great success. Beatrix Potter wrote 23 other illustrated animal tales between 1902 and 1930, for which she also drew all the illustrations. The stories still remain in print and are enjoyed by children today.

Tales of Beatrix Potter was a film version of the Beatrix Potter stories mounted by The Royal Ballet. The ballet was arranged by Sir Frederick Ashton who is regarded as one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th Century and the film directed by editor Reginald Mills and the only film Reginald Mills ever directed) who had edited all of Michael Powells ballet films of the 1950s. Tales of Beatrix Potter brings together many of Beatrix Potters characters and blends stories from about nine of her books. The animals are played by dancers wearing costumes and elaborate masks, moving in special dance steps that were choreographed by Frederick Ashton so as to replicate animal movements and to take advantage of the bulkiness of the costumes. The outdoor scenes were also filmed in Potters much loved Lake District.

The film follows the withdrawn Beatrix Potter and the way in which she blossoms when the toy animals in her room come to life. The film was a tremendous success in Great Britain, hitting it big with the younger set and with adults who grew up reading Potter's books. The costumes steal the show, particularly the humanlike masks created by Rostislav Douboujinsky. Frederick Ashton's choreography is also a standout.

Dance on screen rarely captures even half the magic of seeing it live on stage. Which is why this adaptation by the Royal Ballet is so successful and it doesnt even try. Instead the action takes place in a variety of locations, from the green fields of the Lake District to the inside of a giant dolls house. The stories are told simply and directly and with a certain almost clumsy charm. Instead of going for perfection in the dancing, the Royal Ballet dancers have gone for characterizations instead. The various animals have their quirks and eccentricities, and they are fairly authentic: The frog dances like a frog, for example, and not like Rudolph Nureyev.

All of Beatrix Potters most famous faces strut their stuff like Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddleduck, Mrs Tiggy-winkle et al. Constrained by their costumes, not all the dancers have a chance to shine. But Michael Coleman as Jeremy Fisher would put any real frog to shame with his leggy leaps. Filmed in 1971, the ballet has a traditional charm, which crosses the generational divide. With just enough naughtiness, in the form of food fights and plate-smashing mice, to spice up the odd moment of twee blandness.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This 40th anniversary Blu-ray release testifies that this Optimum Home Entertainment / STUDIOCANAL upgrade to the Blu-ray format, is a totally vast improvement over the ghastly old inferior PAL DVD release and totally justified to the HD upgrade and certainly shows up the brilliant choreography by Sir Frederick Aston even more spectacular, especially with a stunning 1080p encoded image and also having a 1.66:1 aspect ratio, shows off the dancers so much more spectacular. Austin Dempsters photography comes off well with particularly strong reds and greens, but always in line with the original sober palette. Grain is fairly minimal, which combined with a slight softness to the image, suggests that some tweaking has taken place. So all in all it is a great presentation. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Again the HD upgrade is generally very pleasing especially when it comes to the soundtrack, which is present in 2.0 LPCM Stereo format. As to the sound itself, it is very crisp and clear, and brings out the best, especially with the direction of composer, conductor and scored by John Lanchbery and is helped along the music, which lushly played by the Royal Opera House Orchestra, holds the ear when not much is changing on screen. Despite its age, it again is a very presented sound experience and will give you lots of joy when you view the dancers and music together, to bring you am magical joyous experience.

Finally, Tales of Beatrix Potter is a really nice and charming film. The creatures are also appealing and as well as very charming, even if the facemasks remain unmoving and inexpressive. The ballet is very well choreographed to the score, which is all chosen from various classical excerpts, and the dancing, at least to someone who is not an expert or proficient at ballet is really very good. There is no plot to Tales of Beatrix Potter as such with this film. The entire film only consists of various dance vignettes and there is no drama to it, not even any dialogue, which helps to be viewed in any country that does not have as its main language of English. And to sum up, it is again a very charming magical experience and a well thought out ballet film and will be appreciated by anyone who loves Beatrix Potter characters that have been brought to life with beautiful ballet interpretation and even if you are not a ballet aficionado, you will have a very enjoyable musical experience watching this Blu-ray disc. Highly Recommended!

585859,5,6303094937,"The ballet, ""The Tales of Beatrix Potter"" is with dancers of the Royal Ballet of London. As soon as you hear that this company is performing this delightful and exquisitely costumed ballet you are right in suspecting you are in for a treat. And with the choreography by Sir Frederick Ashton a more intricate and inspired interpretation could not have been devised.

 From the beginning the dancers in elaborate costumes so resembling their animal characters nearly took my breath away. And I was especially impressed with the large pink pigs dancing on pointe. Only a 1st rate company could have pulled this off.

 In fact, all the Beatrix Potter characters were performed with technical brilliance and interpretation. I remember my own days long ago as a dancer in opera ballets at the Lyric Theater in Baltimore and I know how the weight of a costume can hold you down.

 I was doubly amazed to see the dancers looking like animals bounding around the stage with such apparent ease. This shows the strength and determination of the dancers to give a lively performance and interpretation of Beatrix Potter's characters in her stories.

 I grew up loving these tales and I know all your children will sit back and relax while listening to the stories, and then enjoy seeing them come to life on the stage as the characters in this most unusual ballet.

 And let's remember that ballet is a blend of movement and music but no words are spoken; the success of communication is through the ability of the dancers' pantomime to express the story line and emotional feelings of the characters portrayed.

 I highly recommend this frolicking ballet treat for you and your family!",1408665600,,1674,4.8350877192982455

585893,5,6303094937,"This production is 40 years old, but hasn't aged. Beautifully imagined, wonderful, funny dance interpretations, with scenes in between of the young Beatrix, filmed on location in the gorgeous Lake District of Britain, imagining the stories and drawing characters. My daughter is 3 1/2 and loves watching every minute, and trying out the dance steps. Since the animal scenes are acted out rather than spoken, it's fun for a young child to interpret what's happening without having to follow dialogue. Love the more natural pacing--nice to get away from the frantic pace of Disney type stuff. Some reviewers said ballet dancers in animal costumes seems scary--not the least to her, she knows there are dancers inside and loves it.",1394236800,2,728,5.126050420168068

586101,2,6303094937,"I stumbled across this movie while looking for something to watch with my 5 and 3 year old nephews. I always loved Beatrix Potter's stories as a chid so was optimistic that they would enjoy this dvd. To the dvd's credit (and my nephew's) they sat through about half of it, but with no narration or story line I found myself explaining what was happening throughout. There is no talking, at all, even in the scenes where it depicts Beatrix with her family. What was also difficult for them was the fact that we only saw one scene of each story. For example, the mice getting ready to go on a picnic - but that's the only part we see (which takes up about a page and a half in the book and 10 minutes in the dvd). Later the 5 year old was wondering when we'd find out what happened to the mice, which we didn't. Or Jemima laying an egg and running into the fox. Or Mrs. Tittlemouse hanging laundry. She literally just hangs the laundry. There seems be lots of story setup but no conclusions.

From an artistic view, the music and dancing was well done, which is the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars. I could definitely foresee an older person with an appreciation for classical music, dance, and Ms. Potter's stories enjoying this or perhaps an infant or toddler you want to expose to classical music, but more than once I found myself thinking, ""Who would market this as a children's DVD!""

It wasn't a total waste of time, but I am glad I saw it under my Prime Membership for free and didn't actually pay for it.",1359763200,2,1515,4.330985915492958

586104,4,6303094937,"I saw this film when it first came out in theaters back in the day.  The costumes, scenery and music are still wonderful.  The dancing is a miracle since the characters caper in costumes that fully realize the animals of Beatrix Potter.  To see the cat dance with a tail and full skirt is amazing since her vision is obscured by the big cat mask.  An excellent film for young kids who will be enchanted by these animal personalities. Each dance is like a little book so you can start and stop the film if you have a short attention span kid.

I was disappointed in the quality of the video.  The color in the theater was outstanding.  In this video version there are scenes so dark that you cannot see the dancing.  Some of the country side is murky also.  I am watching on a computer so that may be my problem.  If you are in the same techno boat rent the film anyway.

Six mice in 18th Century costume are sneaking out the front door to have a picnic when they hear the distant strains of a waltz as young Beatrix Potter, a lonely Victorian child, practices at her piano. The mice can't resist the music so they lay down their hampers and began to waltz as the notes of a haltingly-played lesson swirl into full orchestra.  At first the mice dance as couples then they become one waltzing circle, joined together not by ribbons held high but by their tails (O God, someone has choreographed the tails). A gentleman mouse becomes so enamored of his partner that he seizes her long tail and begins to kiss along the length of it just as an empassioned man might kiss a woman's arm.  So much to grow out of the sound of a child practicing piano. What a metaphor for Beatrix Potter's created world, and for Emily Dickinson's and Kenneth Grahame's and the world of St John of the Cross---of all who made so much out of so little and who, when shut in close by a barren external world, found a rich internal world and then had the gift to take the rest of us into that world.

For those toddlers and young children who know the stories by Beatrix Potter, the ballet offers a full-body experience of the geography of the fiction.  Our daughter loves to try to imitate the very humorous (and presumably difficult) dance of Jemima Puddleduck trying to lay an egg.  The entire film itself seems to have been made yesterday--not almost 40 years ago!  The sets are fantastic--especially the lilly pads of Jeremy Fisher.

What I like is that the penchant Potter had for creating the fear of being eaten (it is in almost all of her stories) is muted a great deal in these dances.  What comes across most clearly to the child is the dance itself, and that is, I would say, as it should be.

I am myself more interested in watching ballet after watching this.  And it may just be because this DVD performance can in fact educate children and adults about how to watch dance...but I'll leave that to others to say.",1246147200,5,1026,4.629834254143646

Reviewer Rubel is correct when he says the ballet is lovely and beautiful, and there are many other superlatives which could be used to describe it. It is wonderful for both children and adults, but one learns by reading other reviews, that young children may be a bit frightened by some of the characters, unless they are supervised by a caring adult. Also, children who do not know the animal characters, will probably not enjoy, or even sit through the entire ballet. They need to know the characters, and they need to know what a ballet is. It's a BALLET and NOT a cartoon, to begin with, accompanied by some very good music arranged and conducted by John Lanchbery. I thought I heard some themes of Adolphe Adams from ""Giselle"", and perhaps a theme of Massenet heard in the ballet ""Manon"". Yes, good music, and also beautiful photography of English countryside. By the way, my version is in the l6:9 widescreen format. The sound is monaural, however, it is good quality Dolby Digital.

I'm not very familiar with the names of many of Royal Ballet's dancers, but Fredrick Ashton is the Choreographer, and dances the part of the hedgehog Mrs. Tiggywinkle. Lesley Collier, and Michael Coleman, the stars of ""La Fille Mal Gardee"" (fabulous).....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Herold-La-Fille-Mal-Gardee-Collier-Coleman-Shaw-Grant-Ashton-Royal-Ballet/dp/B0008FXSRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Herold - La Fille Mal Gardee / Collier, Coleman, Shaw, Grant, Ashton, Royal Ballet</a>.....have roles in this ballet. Lesley Collier plays the part of Hunca Munca, but I don't know which character that is. Michael Coleman is especially good as the leapfrog Jeremy Fisher, but all of the dancing by members of the Royal Ballet is superb. The beauty of the ballerina's feet is especially brought out in this ballet, because in their costumes, the feet are all that show.

P.S. I went back and read the names of dancers in La Fille Mal Gardee, and found several names also featured in this ballet. Also, Hunca Munca seems to be the sweetheart of the little mouse Tom Thumb. Very adorable pair.

This collection of her stories told in the form of ballet brings to the screen all the richness of English tradition along with the sweetness and charm of the old English countryside.  Sir Frederick Ashton, himself an English treasure, brilliantly captures the physicality of each of the animals in these classic tales with waddling Pigs on pointe shoes and a frog with leaps that could rival the great Nijinsky himself.

  ************************************
Beatrix Potter: Was probably, the most popular writer and illustrator of children's books. Peter Rabbit, was a main character in a series of her children's books. Her Tales of Peter Rabbit, was first introduced in 1902.  Peter and all the other animal characters in her stories, are depicted in human clothes. The Tales of Peter Rabbit books, have sold more than 150 million+ copies in 35 languages and still continues to do so.

Ballet: (A theatrical representation of a story performed to music and by dance.)

In 1970,the most prestigious ballet company in Great Britain, The Royal Ballet, under the direction of Sir Frederick Ashton, who was probably the greatest British choreographer of the 20th century. Sir Frederick Ashton, choreographed and created with his selected ballet dancers, a motion picture, depicting some of the marvelous characters of the ""Tales of Peter Rabbit."" His prestigious ballet dancers were dressed and made up to look just like the actual animal characters that were depicted in Beatrix Potter's ""Tales Of Peter Rabbit"". The great Sir Frederick Ashton, then age 67, also appeared in the motion picture, as one of the ""Peter Rabbit"" story characters. His performance evidently signifies his endorsement of this motion picture. The film was nominated for two British Academy Film Awards.
This 1970 outstanding motion picture is called, ""The Tales of Beatrix Potter,"" with a magnificent original musical score, specially composed for this momentous motion picture. The distinguishing original music score presented no hesitation in acquiring the prestigious Royal Opera House Orchestra, to provide the musical accompaniment to this motion picture.

There were two factors that at first limited the attendance to this masterpiece motion picture.
First, it was considered a children's movie, secondly, it's was a ballet.
This is a VERY special movie, that very young people will be fascinated with, especially the costumed characters. If you desired your youngster to discover and become knowledgeable of theatrical performances of excellence, then this unique motion picture, will give any intelligent and impressionable child, the desire to appreciate future such performances of excellence.

Not surprisingly, many adults, who have seen this unique motion picture, are equally fascinated with the outstanding original musical score as well as the incredible marvelous transformation of the dancers in the most realistic animal likeness in their make-up.

Those that do have an interest in ballet, will be amazed of the almost impossible ballet techniques that were accomplished while in those most realistic and cumbersome of customs and makeup(masks).

There are no hidden messages in this motion picture, in fact, there is not a single word spoken in this motion picture. It is just a delightful visual experience to see and hear. Most, that have seen this visual and musical experience, are left with the most pleasurable of memories. It is only 90 minutes long.

Many who have seen this masterpiece, will keep this DVD forever, so that you can have it available for future generations of your family, it is timeless.

One very unusual comment, regarding a member of their family, who was affected with Alzheimer, found that their afflicted loved one, truly enjoyed viewing this motion picture. (Maybe, it had reminisce some very pleasurable past  memories.)

586230,5,6303094937,My children are very familiar with Beatrix Potter's stories.  When I saw this video at the library I was curious but hesitant.  The kids had never seen a ballet and I knew it was rather lengthy.  As it turned out they were absolutely fascinated and since they were so familiar with the stories already they easily followed the ballet.  I was fascinated by how well the costumes and backdrops were done - they certainly reflect Potter's gentle colors and drawings.  Is it worth buying?  If you are know much about ballet (unlike myself) and love Beatrix Potter I certainly recommend it!,1139011200,5,585,4.742574257425742
586231,3,6303094937,"I give this 3 stars because it may indeed have some wonderful ballet that I could (or did not) appreciate as a kid. If I were to watch it now, I may have a different opinion.

I am 100% serious about this.

I don't know how young I was when my mother rented this for me. It terrified me. I had recurring nightmares involving the creepy heads. So much so that I still remember it, some 25 years later.

If your child is sensative to strangers in costumes with expressionless heads, like the Easter Bunny, Chuck E. Cheese (such as I was) please take this into consideration.",1114128000,45,572,4.327102803738318
586232,5,6303094937,"This movie is so fun for the entire family.  My children and I all love it.  We check it out from the library but it is so popular that I will probably have to buy it.

In ballet form it tells many of the Beatrix Potter stories.  Unlike most ballet it does not take place on a stage continually but is oftentimes out on a farm or in the hills.  The scenery is beautiful and lends itself to the story.",1112054400,6,400,3.95
586233,5,6303094937,"This is A first rate ballet by a first rate choreographer and a first rate production!  Sir Frederick Ashton actually dances in this himself:  he is the hedgehog seen as the first character.  It is very rare to see this great choreographer dance.  The dancing, which includes pointe, male technique, and (animal!) character, is at times extremely interseting and demanding.  The music is a composite of classical ballet themes(such as Paquita), traditional, and original works.  Although this is definitely intended to be lighthearted, it is a very valuable addition to the modern ballet repertoire.  Buy it!",1093392000,14,608,5.270833333333333
586234,4,6303094937,"Tales of Beatrix Potter with Dancers of the Royal Ballet (1971) is pure fun and innocence portrayed through top flight ballet dancing.  Don't miss this production if you're a fan of ballet, Beatrix, and barnyard animals.
As the story opens, we see a young Beatrix Potter and the beautiful English countryside that was the inspiration for her family of adorable little creatures.  Soon we see Beatrix's creations come to life in vignettes and costumes true to the original drawings.
The dancers appear to be dancing on an earthen stage (complete with clumps of grass, dirt, and hay), but pigs and mice on pointe were never this graceful.  Watch the swine ham it up in a pigs' pas de deux, and see them escape their inevitable fate.  Mr. Jeremy Fisher is one wonderfully flexible, high-jumping leapfrog.  See mice go mad and perform a quick, clean petite allegro with the beautiful pointe work you'd expect from the Royal Ballet.  Peter Rabbit comes in, dancing about very happily, having just raided the cabbage patch.  He is witness to a picnic of rats, crashed by mice and Squirrel Nutkin and his buddies.  This scene is nothing but fun and I can't imagine the dancers didn't have a blast performing it. There's even a food fight.
Don't be put off by the whimsical concept of this production.  These are world-class ballet dancers performing Ashton's warm and witty, yet demanding choreography in top form.
I wish the editing had been better in spots and that the camera angles had been tighter, but I imagine it was necessary to maintain the proper perspective between the sizes of the characters and the sets.  Great costumes and sets convincingly blend with footage of the real English landscape in all its green glory.  Complete dancer credits at the end.",1018828800,67,1760,4.852842809364549
586235,5,6303094937,I love music and find myself huming this ballet over and over.  I particularly love classical music.  This mixed with the Barbie Doll that I have is a legacy I will pass down to my grandchildren.  I even  cross-stitched The Tale of Peter Rabbit with the original pictures from the  book and all the words.  That is a special book I look foreward to giving  future generations.  Suffice it to say - I'm a HUGE Beatrix Potter fan.,953424000,2,428,4.397435897435898

I've enjoyed showing it to my son because it's just nice ballet music in the background instead of annoying little kid music and voices like lots of kids shows have.

The movie is Beatrix Potters' characters in perfect costumes from the books dancing her stories. Music is calm and elegant with the characters played by the Royal Ballet not cartoons.  The toddlers stop in their tracks, watch, dance, sit and play. When the fox was on the attack I watched to see if my 15 mo grandson was scared.  He honked the horn in his car as warning. See photo.  Teens and adults are drawn in with chapter 10 where Jeremy Fisher the frog leaps into their heads as the athlete he is.",1470096000,3,681,4.432
