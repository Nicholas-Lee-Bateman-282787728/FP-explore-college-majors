3684809,4,B001LLA77S,"Its funny, most professional critics either didn't like this (too thin, boring) or loved it (delicate, tells so much with so little).  I found myself in the middle, understanding both sides.  This gentle, quiet, slow moving romance between a Thai woman who runs a nearly abandoned hotel, and an architect who comes to town to help repair a local beach resort after it was devastated by the Tsunami has moments of great grace and tenderness, and moments that feel either heavy handed, or not-quite earned.  Theres an attempt to capture the spooky atmosphere of a town thats been destroyed, leaving behind thousands of ghosts.  That works well when its unspoken and vague.  But a little less well when its made concrete in the form of the lead womans angry rootless bother and her friends, who bring literal violence and danger into the story, in a slightly forced way.  None-the-less, a well made, well acted, well shot, thought provoking first feature.",1307923200,,952,4.91875
3684810,4,B001LLA77S,"Takua Pa is a modern ghost town in southern Thailand,following the 2004 tsunami, situated between the mountains and the sea. The past,only obliquely alluded to, has drained the life and energy out of the place so that all that is left is bad karma. There are ruined houses and shells of hotels from the day when 8000 lives were swept away. One is haunted. The title is ironic(witness the local ne're-do-wells T-shirts).Na (Saisoontorn) says she feels trapped. She is the Chinese-Thai owner of the hotel. Ton(Kansen) is an architect from Bangkok who has volunteered to spend 2 months supervising the erection of sea-side hotels and prefers to stay in Na's quiet rooming house to noisy city life. Between Na and Ton a delicate romance develops. Their restraint is shown in her touching his clothes in his room,his in buying her oranges. This fragile love is pitted against an atmosphere of foreboding,a soundtrack of tidal rumblings,distant bells,industrial thrumming,incessant insect-chitter and a string-heavy score. They make love to a suitably swelling sea. There is a nice evocation of moods and atmospheres.

They get together on the hotel roof sofa at night,he plays her songs he's written(he used to be a musician,run a bar,be an alcoholic in the past and has fallen out with his dad) or takes her for a run in his Suzuki or for a ride on a motorbike to deserted tin mines. Na warns him to be circumspect. Her gangster brother,Wit(Yaambunying) seems to give his blessing,but his gang of hot-headed bikers have broken into his car and are continually harassing them,as if to move him on. Small town malevolence,people disliking the outsider,bring in hints of hostility and danger. Wit is an unreformed reprobate and should be helping his sister run the hotel,instead she looks after his son. Assarat suggests both Na and Ton have emotional baggage. The film is slow moving and has an undercurrent of foreboding throughout,despite its laid-back pace. The final part endorses Wit's narrow-minded prejudices via a revelation regarding Ton's private life,setting up an ending of total surprise and violence due to eroding our sympathies for Ton. The brother is seen working back at the hotel at the end. A metaphoric tsunami that leaves the tendrils of hope crushed in the doom and gloom,for offending the spirits of the dead. Yugala's cinematography has a drained palette,his camera glides hypnotically round the shabby hotel. Assarat here shows great promise for his 1st feature,but needs to develop his scriptwriting to greater depths.",1283040000,8,2539,5.132850241545894
3684811,5,B001LLA77S,"It's a few years after the tsunami of 04 and a Bangkok architect shows up in a rural town in S. Thailand to help rebuild a hotel. He falls for the hotel chambermaid and a romance ensues. I loved the sleepy rural pace of this and the soundtrack is perfect. Many extended silent looks and extra long camera takes, which seem typical of new Asian cinema these days. This indie is relaxing to watch, and there is little dialogue, so the subtitles don't get fatiguing.",1276560000,4,463,4.458823529411765
3684812,5,B001LLA77S,"Excellent movie from an indie ~
This Thai film is set in a small town in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. Though it has been three years since the event, Takua Pa is still recovering from the catastrophe, and its inhabitants are experiencing that same difficulty. An architect (Supphasit Kansen) appears in town to help, but he builds an unexpected romance with the beautiful proprietor of a small hotel (Anchalee Saisoontorn). WONDERFUL TOWN marks the directorial debut of Aditya Assarat.

A great lesson to be learned from those who have suffered through a catastrophy ~ (Katrina victims).",1238544000,2,593,5.051020408163265

3684819,2,B001LLA77S,I found that this movie wasn't for me in a short time of watching it. I didn't finish watching the movie.,1417392000,,105,4.0476190476190474
3684820,1,B001LLA77S,I am a fan of foreign films.  This one I am NOT a fan of.  The story line was to simplistic and moved very slow.  There was one basic idea and not nearly enough supporting details. I found the only drama was at the during the last fifteen minutes of the movie. The actor and actress were fine they just didn't have a good enough script. I was going to stop watching it after the first twenty minutes but kept thinking it would get better but it didn't.,1415836800,,452,4.113636363636363
3684821,4,B001LLA77S,Interesting but somewhat dry.,1414540800,,29,6.5
3684822,4,B001LLA77S,"Wonderful Town was well acted and well written.  It is a minimalist story.  I might have preferred a different ending, but I was able to accept the one that the movie offered.  I did watch with a friend who could not sit still for the movie as it was too slow for him.  I see that as his problem.  I like a slow true story.  But, I mention this in case you have to take such a consideration.",1412121600,,391,3.948717948717949
3684823,3,B001LLA77S,"It's a sweet love story. Gives you a feel for life in Thailand outside of Bangkok. But the characters are not fully developed for this story. The main male character - you don't know about his girlfriend/wife until the end. Why is this town so worked up about the female character falling in love with an outsider?
It's worth watching. I did enjoy it.",1409616000,,351,4.5
3684824,1,B001LLA77S,"Weak story line, sub par acting, nothing whatsoever to hold my interest, should have gone with my gut and turned it off at the hour point. To make matters worse, subtitle got stuck on ""knocking on door"" for the last 30 minutes which would not go away even with stopping and restarting film which of course covered up the verbal subtitles. The ending was totally pointless, left the viewer aghast at having stuck with the movie to have such a meaningless ending. I rarely read reviews prior to films as my opinion often differs from others, but should have on this one. Just goes to show anyone can make a movie. Can't imagine anyone could enjoy this unless you just have absolutely nothing to do and want to be depressed. Total waste of time!",1409443200,,742,4.544776119402985
3684825,2,B001LLA77S,"Started as a peaceful story, terrible ending.
Wish I'd read the reviews before I watched the whole thing.

Misleading title and through most of the movie.
Perhaps the producers are trying to 'send a message', or 'teach a lesson'?
Well, Life is a teacher, and, I don't need reminders of the worst of human behavior.

The authors of this are not contributing to society in any way that I can see.
This movie perpetuates the negative underbelly of humanity.

It's depressing.
A terrible movie.",1408492800,2,490,4.809523809523809

3684827,3,B001LLA77S,"A budding love story between a construction supervisor and a young cleaning woman should certainly not move too quickly. Love isn't like that, but this one does take a little too long. What is surprising is the natural beauty of Thailand's countryside. Fine acting and excellent camera work.",1407888000,,291,5.083333333333333
3684828,2,B001LLA77S,Dreadfully slow...dragged on and on and on.  The ending...unsatisfying and pointless.  This movie is a definite 'pass',1406332800,,118,5.882352941176471
3684829,2,B001LLA77S,"Interesting. sometimes hard to follow,,,, and very depressing end, left with a feeling of unfinished business.  Not sure the title matches the movie content as there was not much wonderful about this town, it was void of color and had survived a tsunami with ruins abundant.",1404777600,,274,4.956521739130435
3684830,1,B001LLA77S,Boring!!!! Life after the tsunami. Long boring scenes without dialog. The ending is totally disconnected from the film. Skip it!,1404000000,2,128,5.45
3684831,3,B001LLA77S,The film is located in the beautiful countryside.  The film moves very slowly with a romance blossoming with no logical happy conclusion.  The ending destroyed the tranquility felt during the movie and left the viewer confused realizing that the sequence shown was because it was a movie.,1400630400,,288,5.1063829787234045
3684832,5,B001LLA77S,This film is a moment to moment about a simple life with great complications.  It has beautifully filmed  scenes. This film is like a Bergmann style movie.,1399939200,,155,4.703703703703703

3684834,5,B001LLA77S,An intriguing film that touches deeply and lingers.  Be mindful of young ones and those light of heart seeing this film due to its theme and the overwhelming sense of loss and loss of innocence. Beware of the ending.,1396569600,,216,4.538461538461538
3684835,3,B001LLA77S,"The ending of this film is way out of keeping with the rest of the movie.
When we see Ton, after consummating his affair with the inn keeper,
weep and promise to return to someone unknown, we assume it's his
former lover or wife.  We expect that the movie will then deal with this
in some way.  Instead, we have his surprise, brutal, senseless slaying.",1391040000,,352,4.4

3684837,1,B001LLA77S,"This movie undoubtedly has an underlying message, but it is just so BORING that I will never figure it out. I tried watching it a second time to possibly catch what I had missed the first time. I went to sleep, so that was it for me. Sorry.",1388275200,,240,4.020833333333333
3684838,3,B001LLA77S,"Very slow moving, very strange and directionless. The only redeeming part of this movie was the beautiful scenery of Phuket. Pointless ending.",1386374400,3,142,5.5
3684839,2,B001LLA77S,Maybe it is a cultural thing but I found the movie to be very slow paced and confusing. The ending was especially bewildering and disappointing.,1382572800,,144,4.8
3684840,3,B001LLA77S,"Must be the culture of the Director, but this movie moved slowly and awkwardly.  The writing was immature in that the main character went from being a drunk and a musician to being an architect, but since this takes 8 years or more in most countries it was not feasible in this 25 year old character.  Then there was the car left over after a murder.  In a small village this would have been noticed, but went undetected by anyone in the story.  Without a written description of the circumstances of the movie it was not clear this took place after the tsunami a few years before.  Would not recommend.",1379462400,,602,4.4363636363636365
3684841,1,B001LLA77S,Couldn't quite understand what was going on in this movie.  Surprising and disturbing things seem to happen for no reason.  Story not fleshed out well enough and dragged throughout.  Would not recommend.,1379030400,,203,5.28125
3684842,4,B001LLA77S,"A simple movie about two people caught in a secret love affair.  It's about finding love, feeling pain, experiencing loss, and how life goes on in the face of adversity.  Very well done!",1378252800,,186,4.606060606060606
3684843,4,B001LLA77S,Great love story! It was a beautiful and innocent story about falling in love. I didn't care much for the ending thouh,1370995200,,118,4.409090909090909
3684844,2,B001LLA77S,"This film was interesting and captivating, although very slow to get to its storyline.  The scenes were what kept me interested, in terms of specifically, the visuals of places and a sense of the countryside.  However, the ending was ... how best to put it?... lame. It felt like there wasn't enough development here. The story could have simply progressed as it had - a slow romance with cultural disconnects - not even necessarily a ""happy ending"" - but this film falls way short when it could have actually been significant.  It's like the screenwriter and director simply ""gave up"" too soon. A shame.  There is potential here.",1368576000,11,630,4.805555555555555

3684846,4,B001LLA77S,We found this movie to be slow yet engaging and a little bit ambiguous which has led to some interesting conversations after watching the movie.,1366848000,,144,4.8
3684847,3,B001LLA77S,"I found the ending very unsatisfying. It seemed frayed and pointless. Man's inhumanity to man, I guess. It left me sad.",1365984000,3,119,4.714285714285714
3684848,1,B001LLA77S,"Boring.  No depth of characters. Stagnate and bizarrely unemotional acting, but perhaps that's because the writer gave them nothing with which to work. Painfully slow plot where one thinks that surely now it will pick up the pace and develop into something of merit.  It never does.  Shots are so long, it makes the films from the dawning era of cinema seem fast.  I fell asleep watching it and woke up in time for the twisted, disgusting, and unexplainable ending.  What a waste of time.  A total dud.

I've watched tons of foreign films and this one is in my top three all-time dislikes. It doesn't even earn one star, but selecting a negative star isn't an option. Did I forget to mention that I disliked the film?",1365379200,3,717,4.5546875
3684849,2,B001LLA77S,A little slow with some unexplained plot turns. Most disappointing is how it finishes unexpectedly with too many unresolved issues...,1364860800,5,133,5.7
3684850,3,B001LLA77S,Movie left me wanting just a wee bit more character development. Scenery was amazing' and the timing was right. But will I be talking about it past the second day? Unfortunately no. Excellent look into Thai culture however.,1363046400,,223,4.894736842105263
3684851,3,B001LLA77S,The movie at first appears to be a character study that could be interesting. The Na character does evolve and we get to understand her. The Ton character is seemingly unattended by the director except in fits and starts. the movie ends without resolution as if the producer and director ran out of money or could not figure out how to end the story arc.,1361404800,3,354,4.461538461538462
3684852,4,B001LLA77S,"I really wanted to give this movie five stars. The ending was completely unsatisfying. The first ninety percent of this movie is gentle love story, told at a slow pace, set against the backdrop of rebuilding after the tsunami. Then the last act takes a completely bizarre turn.

8318365,4,B001LLA77S,"This is a really good movie, but you won't feel that way after the very last scene.
