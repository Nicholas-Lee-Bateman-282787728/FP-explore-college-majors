language and pep talks. Its real and is a need for any fan who has never been behind the scenes
or wants to relive the trill of victory. Follow the Erie (Pa) Explosion from opening practice through
to the Championship game. Its fantastic a must have.",1405555200,,353,4.446153846153846
8732625,5,B00KY4CLK4,"I recommend this to ANYONE who likes football. I have always enjoyed football and the NFL. I got into Indoor football about 14 years ago and never looked back. NFL? pish posh These smaller indoor and arena teams is ""real"" football. Lets face it Roger Goodell has destroyed the NFL and it hurts to watch 1 game for 5 hours and see nothing but yellow flags all over place. Indoor you can actually hit the QB with no worries!! Heck, I'm pretty sure if you tear his head off, you can kick it through the uprights for a point! Obviously I'm joking but you get my point very few rules and penalties which lead to bigger, harder, faster hits that you ever seen before!!! Like cage matches in the WWE. Think it would work for football? IT SURE DOES!! those walls act as a cage for these beast of men who all want the same thing but only 1 can get it! This Series takes you deep inside the Erie Explosion. My personal fav, being an ex football player myself, are the locker room scenes!! When do ever get to go in the locker room with a team at 1/2 NEVER! and with some of these games you see and hear some intense speeches!! Paul Gorman doesn't just present ""here is the Erie explosion enjoy"". he takes you on a full tour explaining the game, the players, the coaches, owners, league owners, Other teams coach and players, practices, tryouts, travel, the list goes on!! Paul lived, breathed, bleed, ate, and you know what else, indoor football for almost an entire year!! This DVD set will make you feel like you are on the team!!",1402531200,,1522,4.362676056338028
