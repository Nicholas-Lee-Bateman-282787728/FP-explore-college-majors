7903159,4,B000003OF1,"""Consider the Sea"" is a good video overview of this major 19th Century American author for high school and undergraduate college students of literature.  The viewer gets to see many key faces and places from Melville's life, and excerpts from his works are dramatically and vividly presented.

It's a bit ""PBS"", but I'd recommmend this video to any rookie Melville fan.",1175040000,,369,5.032786885245901
