8217124,5,B000V7O0FS,"First off, I bought each season seperately and with the current price of this set it is still cheaper to buy them that way.  Ok, I have to say that typically I hate anime cartoons(except Inuyasha and Big O) but these characters were my favorite incarnation of the teen titans from the comic series so I overlook a lot of silliness that I would not overlook in other cartoons.  Examples of this are when a character is yelling at another character their heads change size and exclamation points are drawn around their heads.  There is a lot of that in this series and if that is something that bothers you I would not recommend purchasing this collection.  If, however, you like really good storylines and fleshed out characters this is a great series.",1204588800,,751,4.62406015037594
8217125,1,B000V7O0FS,"Amazon does it again.  I love the Teen Titans.  Don't get me wrong.  But this is $54 and if you buy all the seasons seperate it's a little less than $45 dollars.  Amazon should really take things like this into account when calculating prices...

But them seperate!",1195776000,12,265,4.553191489361702
