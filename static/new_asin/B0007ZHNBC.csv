2254910,5,B0007ZHNBC,"This video is a great companion video to ""What the bleep do you know"" and takes the science of quantum to an easy to understand and personal level.  I recommend this delightful and brilliant video to anyone who wants to understand how to create their life.  This video was presented by Mark Vicente who along with Dr. Joe Dispenza from ""what the Bleep"" endorses this teacher's ""create your day"" information.  What other video could receive ""thumbs up"" from the actress Salma Hayek to the physicist Fred Allan Wolfe!  A must see-check it out!",1111363200,49,541,4.78494623655914
2254911,5,B0007ZHNBC,"If you liked the movie, What The BLEEP Do We Know!? and are ready to try and put to the test some of the extraordinary and bizarre concepts presented there by the group of scientist and friends, you are going to be blown away by Ramtha: Create Your Day DVD. This is a rare, close-and-personal, looking-in-the-eyes-of-greatness instruction by Ramtha on the concept of creating your day mindfully, using the concepts of quantum physics and the power of our minds to alter and shape reality. Having Ramtha explain these concepts at length that were briefly presented in the movie, and then the camera closes up on Ramtha's face and his eyes, and you can literally feel his piercing gaze, and there is so much more there that words cannot tell, but believe me, you can feel it, and you will not forget it, nor his instruction on how simple yet profound it is to wake up every day, and instead of letting the day create you, you create your day the way you would really like it to be, just as great Masters have always done it. One of the great benefits of this DVD is that you can learn this art without having to go anywhere else other than your TV set at home.

You cannot see the backcover here in amazon, but on the back of the DVD there are some fabulous presentations by BLEEP characters.

My favorite is Fred Alan Wolf: ""How a 35,000-year-old wisdom warrior has come to be so well-versed in quantum physics is a delight. In today's world where presidents lie and intelligence networks distort truth, it is refreshing to realize that a deeper reality exists and that someone we can actually believe has access to it. Listen and watch Ramtha. You will get closer to the truth than you can from many of today's resources. Oh, by the way, you will also learn how you create your reality.""

This Ramtha DVD was produced by BLEEP director, Mark Vicente, and has all the talent he shown us in the BLEEP movie; not just for making a great entertaining movie, but for giving us a priceless message with it too!

I asure you, you are going to love this one!",1111017600,406,2050,4.473262032085562

it seem more like a dvd to entice you to go to ramtha's ranch. JZK is more interested in copyrights and rehashing its material, maybe have you bit $10,000 for a one hour session with ramtha. Ramtha is as expensive Eliot Spitzer's prostitutes.

The disapperance of universe by gary renard is a far more interesting book, and gives a better explanation than whatever ramtha gives. Including the creation of the universe. According to ramtha some goddess, altered the semen of other gods to create the human race. the creation of the universe is explained as void contemplating itself by ramtha.

In ""The Secret"" Mike Dooley speaks very specifically about ways to imagine ""receiving"" the life changes -- really feeling and owning our dreams & aspirations.  You know, the scene about really driving the car you want while sitting in your living room.  If you can duplicate that scene as it relates to your health, relationships, family, finances, spiritual development, quality of life, then you can create your life by managing each day's plan.  If Ramtha takes 45 min of your time without doing more than to just motivate you, without giving you more concrete instructions than I just gave you, ... well, she's ripping you off.  Can someone please give me a better hint about which one she does?

The ideas may be familiar, but have we internalized them? Even having heard this philosophy many times, when Ramtha started talking about how the worst thing is to see yourself as a victim I realized how that thought keeps reestablishing itself and crowding out growth. I tried creating my day and found myself accomplishing all my tasks effortlessly.

We know the vague concepts already, we are looking for specific information for practical application. That is what this video is advertised as providing; unfortunately, it offers none at all.

But then again after purchasing the DVD and hearing it several times and actually practicing it teachings a few times;is when I began to actually see the Magic of THis Teaching. You see,the problem we have as humans beings;is that we have developed what is called a ??personality identification??lets call this Personality ID(PID).Now since we first came to this plane of existance;this material world we know as our reality;since the first moment we have being constantly recieving and storing information in our ??neuronet or what Ramtha calls the Yellow Brain??.Information that has come from the environment around us(Parents,relatives,friends,extrangers,etc),together with information feedback from our own experiences with(People,places,things,times,events).All of this interaction of Information that has come to us and how we have ??responded to it??throughout the years has created a ??Pattern of Response that is very Particular to each of Us??. This particular way of stimulus-response pattern mechanism has created some ??neurological pattern conections in our neurocortex brain??;it is like a computer program and it is what we call ??Our Personality??. The ??Science of How To Create Your Day??,teaches a simple method of how we can ??DISCONNECT FROM THE PROGRAM OF OUR PERSONALITY?? if we wnat to CHANGE something in our ??PROGAMED PERSONALITY?? that we don't like! Maybe we want to gain some weigth,or the other way around;maybe we want to act in a different way,maybe we want to be more agressive with people at work,or maybe we want to be a calm person and not be so aggresive,we want to change depreession,we want to stop drinkin too much liquor;maybe we want to be a nicer person to our couple. But whatever it is WE WANT TO CHANGE,its SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT BEING ABLE TO DO BECAUSE WE ARE STILL CONNETCED(WIRED)TO THE OLD PROGRAM OF OUR PERSONALITY!

So in ??Creating Your Day??the Master Teacher send us a very simple yet profound technique on how to DISCONECT FROM THE OLD WIRING OF THE PERSONLITY;and create a ??New Reality in Our Brain??that will make possible the things we want to change in our lives!

You want to change your life:??Change the Way You THink??,But in order to do so you must first of all learn how to ??Disconetc for the Old Program of Your personality??.

THis beautifull simple teaching tell you how you can do it!

May you become the person you really want to be.",1146528000,28,2682,5.158620689655172

THIS DVD IS FOR YOU.

If you are aware that you are locked into the trance of your own thoughtforms and that you indeed create your own experience of reality, this talk from RAMTHA is a mind jolt and will assist you in becoming awake.

RAMTHA is a rarity in the illusionary maze of spiritual teachings.

Truly a breath of fresh air.

2254930,1,B0007ZHNBC,"I purchased this item directly as a result of ""What the Bleep"". As with any personal development product, this cd was produced by JZKnight after the 'create my day' segment of the film. It is obviously designed to provide the least amount of information about the 'Create my Day' process as possible. It's aim is to market interest for the viewer in the teachings of Ramtha and the school of enlightenment. Which is Ok if you want to take that path further, but essentially this cd left 'this observer' disappointed and wanting more.",1141344000,40,533,4.741935483870968
2254931,3,B0007ZHNBC,"To free your mind to think independent of religion and many other rules of society and reality as we know it. To not follow someone elses teachings blindly without question, because to question and experiment is how we actually learn and grow. To expand your consiousness. To create your day. To be the master of your reality. Most of what this DVD says will ring true for anyone, it has been taught by many, in many different ways. I am glad that people who have never had the chance to understand this concept were able to come accross Ramtha and her teachings in order for them to better themselves, but after reading all the reviews listed below, I became concerned because honestly, I saw 'What the bleep' and loved it, loved that many of my personal beliefs, gathered through almost 3 decades of study of theology and new age, were being compiled on a DVD and explained in an easy to understand, simple formatted and backed up by scientific theory, each idea expanded and complimenting the next, but these ideas are certainly NOT new... but the package is, at least to me. Ramtha, may or may not be a 35,000 yr. old being from Atlantis, which really shouldn't matter anyway. Atlantis may have existed, but to this day, there is no PROOF beyond what you choose to believe. Ramtha may be a part of some peoples reality, but it is not obsurd for others to think she's a fake. The whole point is to open your mind enough to think independently of what you have been told, yet half these people, upon hearing something true, are ready to follow Ramtha now the way they followed their previous belief system! To the previous reviewer, The Discovery channel, like many other educational channels, gives information for the viewer to decide it's validity. I personally don't automatically believe everything I hear on TV. The word ""fact"" is very misleading if you use it falsly to try and prove a point, when your ""facts"" are theorys and most theorys change or evolve over time. You can do a diservise to others by presenting something in a way to make is seem true when it has not been proven. Think about it, how often have you heard a ""fact"" and then a year later anouther ""fact"" comes in that opposes the first? Which is true? It makes nothing seem credible, even that that is. Creating your own reality means my facts may differ from yours, my path may differ from yours, there is no one way or one superior idea. The teachings here are wise and very old, but it is not the person speaking them that gives them power and people need to remember that when they are so quick to defend the honor of a woman/man/whatever whose intentions are not so wonderful as to offer this enlightenment for free. The DVD does appear to be marketing material for her school of enlightenment. Although I think viewing this is good to expand your own awareness, you should also be carefull how far you take it. How much did Jesus charge? Think about it.",1136505600,41,2936,4.551984877126654

2254933,5,B0007ZHNBC,"My definition of genious is to be able to present a complexity into an idea simple enough for even a child to understand without diminishing it, and profound and powerful enough to touch the depth of one's soul!  The message is profound and compelling and simple.

Those reviewers complaining about the lack of instruction in the DVD, have missed the simplicity of the message, because already they are trying to complicate it, and thereby preventing themselves from participation or already setting themselves up for failure by thinking that there is a right way or a wrong way.  The fact is, if according to quantum physics, the observer creates reality, then thought creates reality.  You're already creating your reality by the thoughts you commonly entertain everyday!

Therefore, if your life is stuck on mundane, it is because your thoughts are predictable and on automatic.

The message in this DVD is to create a pattern interrupt by stopping the tape that runs on automatic, and consciously create a new idea of yourself and how you'd like to see the outcome of your life, day by day!  No one ever told you that you could do that, because corporations, the media and politicians want to tell you what to think and how you should think.  It's called education, advertising and the media.  Who in society, has ever told people about how powerful their mind is and how reality is created?!

Therefore, the simplicity and profoundness of this message has very wide reaching implications both in one's personal life and society as a whole.  It presents a paradigm and a level of responsibility that up until now has not been encouraged at all!

In fact, especially in the USA, the victim mentality has been encouraged and the view that you're not responsible for what happens to you, and you fly through your life by the seat of your pants, acting, reacting and out of control.

This message simply puts the power and control squarely back on your own shoulders or should I say, your own mind!  It is brilliant and revolutionary, albeit, coming off as simple, common sensical as if you should have known this all along.  But think about it.  If the message was that simple and common sense, then why haven't people enacted it commonly?  When a truth simple and powerful resounds to the core of one's being, then it seems that you've always known this at some level and here is a profound teacher, reminding you and pulling out of you a truth, that got educated and programmed out of you.  Do yourself and society a favour, and see this DVD and enact its message in your life.  It will make a profound difference for the better, take worry and stress out of your life and I guarantee that you will love yourself more for it!  What about the criticism?  There is none.  How can anyone criticise something that empowers you and helps you have a better life?  I really have to wonder about such people and such motives.  It's like they are saying please don't change because it threatens my status quo.  Go ahead buy this DVD and change your life.",1135036800,51,3048,4.694915254237288

THE BASIC DISCIPLINE HERE IS TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER FIRST THING IN THE MORNINGS(EVERY MONRNING YOU WANT TO CREATE A DAY FOR):THE THINGS YOU WANT TO CREATE FOR THAT DAY! YOU MUST STATE IN YOUR MIND IN YOUR OWN WORDS VERY SLOWLY BUT CLEARLY AND WITH INTENT WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT TO CRETAE FOR EACH DAY. BUT YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE YOU ARE FULLY AWAKE,BEFORE YOU ARE UP AND BEFORE YOU HAVE LOOKED UP YOUR PERSONALITY IN THE BATHROOM.

THE CLUE HERE IS THAT,ONCE WE GET UP,ONCE WE GO TO THE BATHROOM OUR CONSCIOUSNESS HAS FOUND ITS OWN IDENTITY WITH THE HUMAN EGO THE PERSONALITY,ONCE IN THE MORNING WE HAVE ALLREADY GONE TO THE BATHROOM WE HAVE LET OUR CONSCIOUSNESS REAFIRM ITSELF WITH THE HUMAN PERSONA AND THAT IS EXACLY WHAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS NEEDS TO FIND OUT IN THOSE FIRST MOMENTS OF THE MORNING:TO FIND OUT AND REAFIRM ITS OWN IDENTITY WITH SOMETHING/SOMEONE BECAUSE IN THOSE MOMENTS AFTER A LONG NIGHT SLEEP AND PERHAPS MANY OUT-OF BODY EXPERIENCES TO MANY OTHER DIMENSIONS SUCH CONSCIOUNESS DOES NOT IDENTIFY ITSELF WITH THE HUMAN PERSONA;SO WE( THE HUMAN BODY AND ITS BILOGICAL CLOCK)NEEDS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND HELP THE CONSCIOUSNESS IDENTIFY ITSELF WITH THE HUMAN PERSONALITY! BUT THEN AFTER THIS IT IS TOO LATE TO CREATE YOUR DAYBECAUSE IT IS PRECISELY THAT HUMAN EGO THAT DESCRIBES THE PERSONALITY WITH ITS OLD NEURONET WIRING:THE OLD NEURONET NEIGHBOURHOODWHAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO CREATE OUR DAYS FREE OF ALL THE PROBLEMS OF THE PAST!

SO;WHAT IS THE ANSWER IN THIS GREAT TEACHING:THAT WE HAVE TO START CREATING THE DAY STATING WHAT WE WANTBEFORE THE SPITITUAL CONSCIOUSNESSIS ABLE TO REAFIRM ITS IDENTITY  WITH THE HUMAN PERSONALITY.

BECAUSE IF WE LET THIS MOMENT PASS BEFORE WE ARE ABLE TO CREATE OUR DAY,THEN ONCE THE CONSCIOUSNESS IS BACK AGAIN HOOKED UP WITH ITS HUMAN IDENTITY WE ARE BACK AGAIN IN THESAME MERRY-GO-ROUND OF YESTERDAY CARRYING THE BAGGAGE OF OUR PAST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!

Now for anyone looking to purchase this DVD, i'd like to discourage you from reading a previous review from a very... frivilous minded individual. He or She stated, ""what is the intention of JZ Knight in making up a story about channeling a 35,000 year old teacher from Atlantis? DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS AN ENLIGHTENED CIVILIZATION CALLED ATLANTIS EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO PHYSICAL RECORD OF IT HAVING EVER EXISTED??? ""

Making up a story? Because this person actually knows this to be the truth, right? Wrong. That's their personal opinion, i respect that, so be it. But theres a fine line between stating your opinion and running your mouth with fantasized assumptions.

And to correct this individual... yes, there is physical evidence of Atlantis. Watch Discovery Channel a little bit more, or better yet, go on a dig yourself. Coming from an Archeaologist, that should mean something. In 1970 a pyramind explored by Dr. Ray Brown on the sea floor off the Bahamas unearthed some amazing discoveries surrounding ""Atlantis"", I haven't the time to go into details, but I suggest doing your own research too. In 2003,  The A.R.E.'s Search for Atlantis project, once again, unearthed multiple discoveries. I can go on and on about excavations that came up with actual physical evidence of the lost city's existance. But i haven't the slightest bit of interest in doing so, atleast my point will get across, thats all i care about.

As far as the ""35,000,000 yr old warrior"" that this woman claims to be. So be it. Who are you, better yet.. who does anyone think they are to try to question that? If this is what she believes, this is what she believes. Sounds crazy? Yes, indeed! But from personal experiences of very close friends and even myself, i know it IS possible for someone to be a ""35,000,000 yr old warrior"". The body ages, not the soul. One of my school teachers claimed to be a warrior of some kind aswell, she would break out in strange dances and strange ""war"" calls would come from her mouth. She would almost go into a ""Trance"" when certain music was played. It was quite a sight, thats for sure. Not sure if i totally believe that about her, but i believe it somewhat. She was NOT making any money from claiming this and it wasn't getting her anywhere in life, she had nothing to gain from making it up.

Can't we stop being so cinical and believe in something a little bit, now-a-days? Just because someone makes money, doesn't mean everything they say is a lie and a gimmick to get you to buy something from them.

Think about it...",1130457600,12,2766,4.609756097560975
2254937,1,B0007ZHNBC,"Since this DVD was made by the same peoople who brought us ""What the Bleep"", it is relevent to look at some of the issues regarding that film:

A number of friends had recommended this movie, so I was looking forward to it. However, as soon as I saw JZ Knight I had my doubts. She seemed to me be a huckster. I wondered why, with all of the really solid spiritual teachers available, the filmmakers would choose her. The other talking heads were a bit uneven, but one or two seemed like they might be solid. Anyway, I saw the movie twice and then, because I still had doubts, I looked into the film a little more and found a few unsettling items:

*Followers of JZ Knight made the film. They were apparently unconcerned that in the 1980s she had her students use copper to shield against aliens, that she had predicted a number of apocalyptic disasters which never occurred, that it can cost thousands to hear her talk (yes, I know that initial lectures are less expensive).

*One of her former students says he quit working with her after finding her practicing her Ramtha voices. It didn't seem to me she had practiced them very well!

*The psychiatrist studying physics, Jeffrey Satinover, has a book calling for attempting to cure homosexuals. He believes that they are ill. He lists Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as one of his heroes!

*The Irish theologian in the film had to resign as president of his college as a result of a scandal.

*Many of the ""scientists"" are lecturers at Knight's center.

==> One of the few real scientists in the film, David Albert, has charged the filmmakers with carefully selecting bits of his hours of interview to present a point of view that is 180 degrees opposite of what he said. THINK ABOUT THIS. The filmmakers have, I believe, discredited themselves entirely through their misrepresentation of Dr. Albert's views. Why would they do this if they were really interested in the truth? <==

I really believe that intentions matter and that they shape our life. If you agree, please ask yourself, what could possibly be the intentions of filmmakers who distort the material provided in interviews? More importantly, what is the intention of JZ Knight in making up a story about channeling a 35,000 year old teacher from Atlantis?

2254946,4,B0007ZHNBC,"This is a DVD in the extension of ""What the Bleep Do we know"".  It is a recording out of JZKnight's conferences (I think).  After I watched the DVD, I have mix feelings towards the teachings.  Words are animating when it is coming out of JZKnight (Ramtha's mind), of course.  His/her words are powerful if you use your heart to listen and to understand, to implement such teaching to create your day and make a change consciously.  Yet, the message behind the presentation is not anything human beings have not heard of ever.  Consciousness, go listen to Eckhart Tolle's CDs about ""The Power of now"".  Consciousness, go read Don Miguel Ruiz's books.  Ramtha's teaching (the enlightened One), is not that unique of a concept either.  But it is so amazing to me that all the students follow like a servant instead of using Ramtha's words as a way to empower themselves.  Even the Bible and Buddhism are originally created to inspire human beings to grow and to find out their true beautiful nature.

The heart of the message around Ramtha's teaching is to break away from the mental prison the society, religion has created to limit ourselves. The heart of the message around his (her) teaching is that man and woman are equal, even Ramtha's followers and Ramtha (himself/herself) are in equal footing with Ramtha.  Teacher is what we can call Ramtha, yet, Ramtha can and should only inspire us and to empower us.  We should never allow any other identity of the outside world take control/take over our own spirit (meaning our own divine right to make our own life decisions).  Ramtha's words are powerful if you allow his words to inspire the spirit inside you to grow out of your own shell.  But certainly, I feel that Ramtha's way is NOT the only way to exceed our current potential.  I feel that there many other ways, other forms of teaching that can inspire us to grow and become the unique individual, the enlightened (awaken) one.

Ramtha's words, is not meant to be lived like a gospel for others to rigidly follow.  It requires each human being to think, to process his/her message and allow us to come up of our own way of how we want to live lives for our own self.  Take what make sense to you and leave what does not make sense to you.  Enlightenment, what a way to express one self.  But everyone's path to enlightenment is different.  And everyone's experience of enlightenment (awakening) is different.  There is no such a place call the promise land/heaven for you to seek and to live joyfully ever after.  Heaven exists in the mind level and exists in the now.  Heaven is a state of mind and Ramtha's words/teachings is one of the many ways to help us get there (which is actually here and now because it is your conscious mind that allows you to see your own divine, joyful being).  There are many different roads you can follow through to awaken your own spirit.  There is no right and wrong.

Ramtha cannot save you.  It is the same as Jesus Christ did not save us.  But allowing Ramtha's teaching (or any other teachers' teaching) for our daily inspiration will ""save"" us from entering the state of mind call hell (or we should say redirecting our mind to enter heaven).  Jesus' 33 years of life on Earth is another inspiration of how we can live a life out of the mental prison because of judgment and fear.",1121040000,20,3330,4.574324324324325
2254947,1,B0007ZHNBC,"I had seen Ramtha of the ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" video and her contribution seemed fine. In this video she erases any positive views I had of her. Ramtha uses quantum physics to draw conclusions on how an individual can control his world. She presents possible paradigms of quantum physics as facts! This kind of mixing is not new. Over the centuries physicists have been influenced by religious beliefs and likewise religious theologian influenced by physical laws. History shows that this mix does not help either physics or theology.

Ramtha reminds the viewer that he is a divine being and seems to associates a certain level of omnipotence with that. She stands at one pole of the powerless vs omnipotence school of thoughts, in favor of the latter. The viewer gets the impression that by being a student of her organization he can unlock the secrets of playing god in his/her life. I think the viewer would be much better served by a teacher or speaker that explains how to be in harmony with the world around us and how to work on our perception of events, people, and things in order to lead a more peaceful life and better deal with crisis.",1119398400,25,1153,4.624390243902439

This DVD from Ramtha presents us with the idea that we just may be the best source of empowerment ourselves.  Not the pushy aggressive sort of power, but the watch and see wht I can do sort of power.  It is a rather personal approach.  Begin your day by dreaming of what you want in the day rather than just letting it happen to you.  Ramtha even outlines a basis for this view in the world of quantum physics.  When you dream in this way you are being the observer affecting the quantum field.  I had heard of the observer in some comments of Einstein, but had never applied it to everyday events.  Maybe I should know more about this observer thing.  I like the idea that I can mold my own day according to my dream and Ramtha goes on to say that this is a source of hope.  I like that idea also.  Maybe it really is all about me.",1117756800,,952,4.136612021857924

The production value is horrible. You can hear people coughing and talking in the background.

The entire 'movie' consists of a woman talking and all you see is her face the whole time. No B roll. No animation. Just a boring woman talking dribble drabble.

The content is such intellectual junk that it's not useful at all. It will just create a more clouded and cluttered mind, which is the opposite end of all spiritual pursuits.

The worst part is watching this woman blab on like she's a great speaker, but all that's coming out is hypothetical nonsense.

2254951,5,B0007ZHNBC,"I was very curious after seeing the movie What the Bleep, who was that blonde woman in the movie called Ramtha? I did some research and found there was a workshop from his school near where I live. It was only $250 for the weekend, with the first night free, so I said, hey, what the heck, let's find out and see. A while ago I stopped asking my friends about new movies I wanted to see. Most of the time I find they were wrong. I make it a rule to find out for myself first. So I went, and I was really impressed.

First of all, there was no cult thing, weird stuff going on, pyramids on your head or strange clothes, etc., as some critics keep saying. What I found was, right at the start of the session, they had us in the audience try out some remote-viewing with each other. Simple things we draw on a piece of paper and the person next to us has to know what we draw without seeing, and then take turns. Well, you are not going to believe me, but a huge amount of people were able to do it exactly right. This is way cool. I got it right, of course! I did not know I could do this. I thought this was only something out of the x-files, or something like that. If you ask me, finding this out about myself, and learning some really simple techniques to practice this on my own was well worth the money and the time going to this RSE workshop. I am having fun with this thing. I am trying to remote-view what my boyfriend is really thinking! Ha.

The other thing I wanted to share here is this scientific paper we got at the workshop with information about some scientific testing they did on Ramtha that got published by the scientists in The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, a trustworthy society founded in 1885, so it is the real deal as far as science goes.

This is what the scientists were saying about Ramtha, check it out:

""JZ Knight, who had been channeling Ramtha the Enlightened One, a spiritual teacher for the previous twenty years, `is not a fraud,' According to Dr. Stanley Krippner, a psychologist and the leading parapsychology researcher in the U.S. who rigorously tested Knight at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE) in Yelm over a period of 18 months.""

"" `She's not faking it,' added Ian Wickramasekera of San Francisco's Saybrook Institute of Graduate Studies, `because when we hooked her up to test her physiological responses, we got results which could not have been manipulated.' According to Wickramasekera, when Knight left her body and Ramtha took over, the heart rate hit a low of 40 beats per minute and then raced to 180 beats per minute. In her normal resting state, Knight's heart rate was between 85 and 90.""

""According to conference organizer Gordon Melton, Wickramasekera was initially not interested in being involved in the study and did not expect to come up with such significant results.  `You might see this in someone who is jogging or having a serious panic attack, but at the time Ms. Knight was sitting completely still,' said Wickramasekera, who used state-of-the-art equipment to test Knight. He conducted the physiological tests three times and the results were consistent in all three runs. `Science demands repeatability and Ms. Knight allowed us to perform these tests three times.' ""

""Wickramasekera explained how eight standardized, physiological, psychological, and behavioral tests were administered. `When you go fishing you use a big net,' Wickramasekera said. `What we didn't expect was to find fish in all eight nets.' The results of the physiological tests showed that when Knight is channeling Ramtha, her muscle tension, pulse, and galvanic skin response increase while skin temperature and blood volume both decrease. Wickramasekera affirmed that Knight could not have voluntarily changed or faked all eight of these results.""

I must say that seeing the Ramtha DVDs, Create Your Day, Cracking the Code to the Extraordinary, and A Message of Joy, now make a lot more sense to me after I went to the workshop and learned my natural talent as a remote-viewer (smile). Some of the things Ramtha says there may seem too simple and nothing new, but when you put them into practice with the simple techniques and instructions I got there over the weekend, now I understand the value and how far reaching and applicable they are to my life everyday. And I can do this in my own time, in the privacy of my own home, without having to go anywhere else. If you are interested in finding out some really cool, sci-fi stuff we can do with our brain and our mind, check this out. You may like it as I surprisingly did!",1116028800,50,4604,4.625458996328029

This DVD has awesome, easily applicable information. The context of the knowledge given is thorough in concept, logical, and left me with the utmost awe and respect of the source of this simple knowledge - Ramtha.

Personally, I love it when I have an understanding about something, that hasn't been totally formulated, but is just on the verge of expression in my life. And then, when given some great knowledge like on this DVD, I'm able to better create an experience that pushes my life's expression and understanding into a surprisingly greater and unexpected reality.

2254957,5,B0007ZHNBC,"Ramtha was filmed for this DVD in front of about a thousand people.  I was there.  He did it in one brief sitting (about an hour) with NO ""re-takes""....mainly because he doesn't need re-takes.... his mind is one of the 7 Wonders of the galaxy.  The subject of his talk was one that has come up repeatedly since the release of ""What The Bleep Do We (K)now?""  The world is about to find out that creating its day -- as opposed to living it haphazardly -- is about as potent a piece of inter-dimensional insight as has ever come down the pike to this planet.

Ramtha is....irrepressible.  You never suspect what he's going to say next, but when he says it, it invariably rings true.  When he speaks about creating your day, the teaching seems simple enough.  Later, it dawns on you how profound.  Could this be the mark of genius? -- the ability to express in words what would otherwise be patently obvious, if we were more in touch with the spectacular nature of our minds?  It takes a sage....apparently.

His instruction is so applicable that you'll be moved to play it to people -- even the notoriously cynical or the can't-be-bothered.  Because, hey....what if we've been given one of the KEYS to REALITY here, baby?  Right here, right now.  I mean, Real-ly.

This DVD is a gem....a jewel.... and will remain a classic.  It goes into delicious detail -- but in a simple, uncluttered way.  It's very....sweet -- one might say.... charming.... with a sort of chatty quality about it....but a very focused chattiness.  I told a group of my old hometown buds to get a hold of the thing and chew on it a while....because, hey, what Ramtha's saying here is quite accessible to any thinking, reasoning person.  It's a disarmingly down-to-earth, yet penetrating, message that oughta be up for some film award.  I hereby nominate it..... you name the category.... how about ""Best Impromptu Heart-to-Heart"" ...or... ""Best Fireside Deliverance by an Immortal.""

The DVD will appeal to a wide audience....one is almost tempted to say a general audience.  After all, even if you don't believe an ascended former person can borrow a woman's body and speak excessively great and inspiring truths through it from a sublime frequency, you'll look at this and be obliged to admit that Ramtha is the greatest actor/actress of all time....and with the Greatest Message Of All Time, to boot.  I mean, there's no quantum physics in his talk that even the most superstitiously squeamish of minds can't get jazzed by.  (And if there is, they better start creating their day more often).

It'll also make you want to create your night.... your week.... your next week.... heck, your next couple hundred years.  Never has a DVD featuring the monologue of so extraordinary a consciousness so understatedly provoked the splendid intent of so many blatantly latent minds.  Now whenever I see the bumper sticker ""Shift Happens"" I'll revise it in my head to say ""Shift Happened--The Ones I Made Today.""  Ha!-- Quantum particles never had it so good! -- they're clearly being motivated now into a bonanza of frequency-specific perks and permutations in the wake of ""Create Your Day"".",1113004800,29,3153,4.82122905027933

The DVD ""Create Your Day"" by Ramtha was introduced to the public by Ramtha's student Dr. Joe in the movie ""What the Bleep Do We Know."" Ramtha, in this DVD brings to life the concept of how and why we create the day.

Through a greater understanding of ourselves and by creating our day, we begin to take control of, responsible for, and become more creative over our lives.

Looking into Ramtha's face in this DVD makes it a unique experience. One feels as if Ramtha is with you in your home, having a conversation over a cup of coffee, or having a glass of wine with him, that in itself is an experience not to be missed...",1112745600,24,721,4.286764705882353

The concept of creating your day lends such hope to the hopeless and inspiration to the uninspired, that even an modicums worth of believe in this discipline can begin to positively change your life.  Ramtha explains in complimentary teachings that not only do the great scientific minds have access to the quantum world but so does everyone, and that if we consciously create our day through our access to the world of the unseen, which is the foundation of all things, then we can begin to see how our dreams can become real.  This video teaching represents an opportunity to begin the process of changing your life. It is an exquisite teaching and I am very happy to have it.",1112745600,27,967,4.842424242424243

When I began to do this simple little process, I realized that I was taking responsibility for myself and what I wanted to experience that day, and because I was experiencing those very things that I had created....well, that just spurred me on to do more. I now know, that the quantum field causes my thoughts and expectations to occur, all the time.

The presentation of Ramtha 'up close and personal' ensures that we get his message loud and clear, as he addresses the subjects of doubt and hope, assuring us of the divinity within each and every one of us, and that life is a gift.

'What The Bleep Do We Know' is a must see along with 'Create Your Day', as it also takes you down the rabbit hole of endless exciting possibilities.

2254961,5,B0007ZHNBC,"I would like to tell you a little story of mine and direct your attention to a landmark event that is happening as a result of the impact of film ""What The Bleep"". I was in what my teacher Ramtha calls ""the dark night of the soul"" when I came to see him for the first time some 19+ years ago. Having reached the pinnacle of my career goals by age 30 and having the means to acquire anything I desired, I realized I was a very unhappy person, even with all that I had. After searching for answers to my life's purpose and finding only partial truths in the religion in which I was raised, TM, est, the Communication Workshop, Rebirthing, endless psychics, tarot card readers, and astrologers, I finally found answers to questions that rang deep to the core of my being in the teachings of Ramtha.

I have been a student ever since and those that truly know me have seen tremendous changes in a man on the brink in the late 80's, to the passionate, sincere, and impeccable being I am today.

My life has become ""some kind of wonderful.""

Part of being the progenitor to make that happen was a teaching of Ramtha's discussed in What The Bleep by Dr. Joe Dispenza called ""I Create My Day."" This has been the single most impactful thing many people took away from this film. Dr. Joe, as he is affectionately known, learned that from his teacher as well, Ramtha. What The Bleep director Mark Vicente asked Ramtha if he would share his teaching of ""Creating the Day"" with the world, and filmed his reply. ""Now Ramtha has released a special DVD for showing you how easy it is to Create Your Day[SM]."" That has now been coupled with the March 15th DVD release of What The Bleep and immediately shot up into Amazon's top 30 orders in the first week.

""Creating the Day"" is a monumental teaching that gives everyone hope for building a life they truly desire and having that life unfold before their eyes. That is why this DVD is making such waves. To continue this recognition, I am inviting everyone to purchase the ""Create the Day"" DVD to add to their library and to share with their family and friends, bringing a message to the whole world that we are truly the creators of our reality and our lives...",1112659200,31,2196,4.4148148148148145
2254962,5,B0007ZHNBC,"""To let life happen to you is irresponsible. To create your day is your divine right."" -Ramtha

You're always creating your day-and your reality-regardless of whether you consciously intend to do so. That is, your thoughts affect your reality just as the Observer affects the Quantum Field. Our attitudes, assumptions, and expectations reinforce the neural net of our brains. The good news is that we can expand-and change-this neural net by consciously creating our day.

Before we fully awaken, we are dis-identified with our ""identity"". We literally re-orient ourselves to familiar ruts when we begin to think along the same lines day after day.  However, before we ""bond"" with our neural net, we can literally choose to create our day according to what we'd like to experience. Ramtha gives a word of caution, however: ""create only those things you are willing to accept.""

According to Ramtha, Quantum Physics is the only science that factors in your opinion. This is why you-and your thoughts-matter so much. In fact, Ramtha says that you matter, and would be greatly missed in this time if you weren't here.

This 45 minute DVD is purely Ramtha speaking to the camera (though J.Z. Knight). Although Mark Vincente had a hand in it, neither he nor any of the individuals featured in the movie What the Bleep Do We Know?! are featured in this DVD. I love the fact that there are no ""fillers"" or grand introductions to this DVD. The video begins-and ends-with Ramtha speaking about how we can create our day with awareness.

In this delightful invitation to open your mind, Ramtha explains how thought is the architecture of reality-and how to MAKE life happen...rather than have it happen TO us. The superstitious, as well as those who think this is all hogwash, are creating their day. Everyone gets to have what they deem necessary, says Ramtha.

Ramtha also addresses our notions of God and how we've created Him in OUR image, rather than the reverse. ""Pretty soon"", says Ramtha, ""you'll graduate God from something mean and fearful to something sublime...The greatest worship we can have for God is to live LIKE God. The greatest gift we have is not what God can give us, but to celebrate live every day.""

My favorite parts of this DVD are when Ramtha explains what doubt is...as well as the definition-and purpose-of hope. ""Doubt is a word describing a desire not to participate. Doubt keeps you from changing your life, your beliefs, you religion..."" Hope, on the other hand, is ""the permission to think beyond restraint-to live without confinement...Possibilities ring the bell of hope. Is it possible to live beyond my confinement?""

Ramtha answers this question with a resounding YES. Yes, indeed, you CAN live beyond the restraint of established thought and the environmental reinforcement of those thoughts!

You were just waiting for someone to encourage you to be the ""more"" that you are, weren't you?

Today, I will have an encounter with the unusual.
