Miffy is a collection of short stories aimed at very small children. The stories are told using bright primary colors with simple drawings. The musical score is simple and easy to follow.

The stories are aimed at the prekindergarten age group that has a good understanding of English.

The stories do not contain violence or bad language. However, depending upon the child's emotional maturity and ability to distinguish TV as ""not real,"" one or two stories could cause concern. All stories end with a happy ending and no characters are harmed.",1369526400,,610,4.846153846153846
