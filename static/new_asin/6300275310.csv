The original theatrical version of this was full screen (4:3), or very close to that, so Disney butchered this masterpiece and cut off the top and bottom of the video frame, which makes the viewing experience pretty miserable, because about 30% of the original frame is not visible.

304672,4,6300275310,"First I want to say, This is one of my most favorite movies made by Disney.  Second.  Disney should have done a better job of releasing this 50th anniversary.
 I expected more bonus features on this DVD,  but there wasn't.  Like some of their other anniversary editions to Disney movies there needs to be a documentary about the movie I'm sure there is a fairly interesting backstory behind the making of this movie.  The picture when you watch the Blu-ray is actually stretched out and it cuts out a little bit of the animation picture on your TV ,  although the colors come out beautifully and the picture is very clear still it's mediocre at best.  I give this movie four stars because I am a diehard fan of the movie sword in the stone.  I recommend this Disney movie to people of all ages this Disney movie has everything you could want,  Great music , Great story board , Great adventure  and great animation.  Advice to Disney company :  Re-release this movie on a two disc edition like you did with sleeping beauty with some  excellent bonus features such as a documentary about this movie  Enhance and Remaster this movie don't stretch out the picture.  Put in some live action sequences from the making of this movie  Create some live footage of Disney World regarding to sword in the stone and how important it is to Disney World",1504483200,,1340,4.539748953974895

When I got home and popped in the disc, I was horrified at how awful the quality is. The aspect ratio is modified and not true to the original. So much of the top and bottom of the image is hacked off. You can get away with this when modifying widescreen content to 4:3, but when you do it the other way around it just looks like garbage. The smearing of all the fine detail is also pretty bad. I don't get it. I've seen higher quality HD copies of this movie floating around. I wanted to legitimately own this movie for myself, and yet I am punished for giving Disney my money. I hope Best Buy will let me return this opened box. If they won't, I will be left to having to sell this to some other poor sucker so that I can try and recoup my wasted money on this garbage. Shame on you, Disney.

My wife thought the subject matter would not interest my daughter at all but I reminded her ""wait for the parts where he turns into a fish, squirrel and bird."" Sure enough, my daughter will go to her stack of movies and grab this (or Land Before Time) and these are her two ""go-to"" movies.

I'm so delighted that she will have the same fond attachment to this movie that I do.

She becomes distracted during the actual sword in the stone part but she'll have plenty of time to figure those parts out when she's a bit older and developed. So awesome. Looks wonderful on Blu-Ray too.",1488931200,2,715,4.409090909090909

The result looks pathetic compared to older classics, and it may or may not affect your enjoyment of the feature. The main character of Arthur has virtually no personality nor mode of willpower, and several plot points feel more forced than charming.

305577,3,6300275310,"This movie is good for kids, but I'd love to see Disney do an animated version that's closer to the book. That would be even better for kids. When Merlyn changes Wart into a bird, for example, it's a far more menacing experience in the book -- ditto when Merlyn changes Wart into a fish. Both experiences are helpful when Wart needs to get that sword out of the stone; what he's taught echoes in his ears. In the film, it's all very cute and silly, leading nowhere. And I don't understand why Disney had to make Sir Ector's son Kay into such a boor; is there no room for subtlety? Anyway, my little nephew is enjoying the movie, and when he's older I'll start reading him the book. And perhaps, until he's ready, gloss over the Latin jokes.

305645,5,6300275310,I was thrilled that my daughter loves this as much as I do. It's funny but also a bit majestic and beautiful. The music is not up to the same level as other Disney films but the story really stayed in my mind as a child. I think the themes and ideas are much more powerful for children than in moany Disney films--overcoming adversity and courage are par for the course. But this film has something a bit more evocative for children in the idea of a great destiny for an ordinary person. The little boy comes to inhabit his role rather than being obviously great from the start. He is not seen as special by anyone but rather he becomes extraordinary through his own actions (plus magic and happenstance).,1454371200,2,705,4.430769230769231

This one, I do, and I will be watching it more than once over time.  Why 4 and not 5 stars?  No analytical reason, just ""I like it"" and I don't get a ""I love it"" feeling, which is probably more personal than critical.  There are a lot of renditions of the Merlin and King Arthur stories.  This one is just plain fun Disney, like a flamingo playing with a yo-yo.  And that is what entertainment is all about for me, fun and well done, or done well.

You are introduced to a young Arthur, is is being raised with a quires future. By chance, he crosses paths with Merlin who begins educated Arthur, knowing he will one day sit on the throne. The animation is still amazing even though this movie was done way before Pixar. There are cute songs that similar to those you find in Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Mary Poppins and other great classics.

305929,2,6300275310,"(This is a review of the blu-ray disc, not the film, which is a certified Disney classic.)
Oh dear! Disney, the once and future king of high-definition transfers, has not only dropped the ball but the ball has bounced out of the court, rolled onto the highway and been flattened by a convoy of semis.

The picture has been scrubbed to death soooo much that much of the motion is smeary  to the point that I thought there was something wrong with my AV equipment. But after reading other reviews I was relatively relieved to learn that it is just the disc at fault.

As it is merely an anniversary edition the supplements are thin on the ground as well.

As an act of goodwill and to restore faith in the fans, Disney really should remaster this transfer and offer an exchange scheme. (Or at least offer a remastered disc as a reward on their DMR site for those who have already redeemed the points for this version.)
In short, there is not much point in upgrading from the DVD. But don't let this one slip put you off all of Disneys catalogue. All of their other blu-rays I have watched have been exemplary. Which is what makes this release such a disappointment.",1437004800,15,1163,4.446009389671362

305980,5,6300275310,"There are several things that have always stood out to me in Disney's Sword in the Stone making it an enduring favorite. The colors used in animating the Disney films of this era are very distinct to the time and I think Sword in the Stone makes use of those colors in such a striking way. To me they still dazzle my eye to this day above and beyond any of the other Disney animated movies. Slowly through the course of the film I feel more and more like a kid again, lost in the arresting palette adorning each scene. This could be attributable to personal nostalgia from when I first saw the movie as a kid but it is still one of the big reasons I'm such a fan. The film is loosely told in an episodic fashion displaying specific lessons young Arthur receives from his mentor Merlin while in the larger story arch Arthur thanklessly attends his foster brother and father as a squire, servant and maid as they ready for a jousting tournament that will determine the new King of England. I have always much appreciated the narrative structure of the story but I can understand how it might feel choppy to others. Ideas take precedent over action in Sword in the Stone which also makes it a unique Disney offering in that it explores openly universal themes untapped previously by animated features. Again this serves the particular vibe of the narrative extremely well introducing the audience to age-old wisdom through fantastical magical adventures such as Merlin and Arthur's day as a squirrel and later as fish. Another wonderful component to Sword in the Stone are the characters. Arthur for one is a  likable protagonist who embodies the underdog spirit with such conviction that the triumphant conclusion is always worthy of cheers. Merlin is also quite a card and his interactions with his pet owl Archimedes is played wonderfully with many laughs. Sword in the Stone has a charming sense of humor and this is another substantial positive component for me. The humor, because it is mostly character driven, feeds into the affability of the entire cast. So Don't overlook Sword in the Stone and keep in mind that it is a slightly different Disney animated film that is inspired more by its ideas than its battles.",1431216000,,2220,4.6923076923076925

306087,5,6300275310,"THE SWORD IN THE STONE has always been my favorite Disney animated film. Why? The answer is quite simple really. I saw it when I was a kid on its initial release in the downtown theater, I had a great time and I have very fond memories of the movie and the entire experience of going to see it with my family and friends. Isn't that what Walt Disney had in mind? It wasn't until years later and I had my own child that I began to realize that not many people even remembered THE SWORD IN THE STONE or knew it even existed. I was rather flabbergasted by this not to mention all the bad press this film had received as I started researching it. My most cherished copy of this film has always been on Laserdisc, but now it looks like THE SWORD IN THE STONE is finally getting some well deserved recognition. I love this film and the artwork is very reminiscent of ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS and the relationship between Merlin and Wart and the development of those characters is pure Walt Disney.

Wish there had been more of Mad Madam Mim (Martha Wentworth) and less of the oaf Sir Kay (Norman Alden) and the slightly abusive foster father Sir Ector (Sebastian Cabot).  But the story, mostly dealt with in repetitious `lessons' moves along at a decent clip (but it does suffer from being too episodic in nature).  Archimedes (Junius Matthews) all but steals the film.

306196,5,6300275310,"Growing up, the Sword In The Stone was one of the most often played videos in my Disney library for some reason.  And unlike some other Disney movies it has stood the test of time.  I still enjoy it as much as I did as a kid.  I'm saddened to hear that so many critical reviews give it just a passing rating.  I think it's easily one of the top 5 Disney movies made by Walt.

Okay, let's get the worst thing out of the way.  The animation, while not up to the studio's usual standards, is not bad at all.  It's well drawn, and as noted by several other people they keep the character designs consistent even when they transform.  So really, I found nothing bad about it at all.  I can understand why some people don't like the slow place and lack of a plot, but that never bothered me.  Part of this is because all the characters are great and it's so funny.  Okay, not every scene is hilarious (one of my favorite parts is when they become squirrels, because though it's very funny for the most part the end of that bit always makes me cry), but I still find myself having to pause the film at least once a viewing because I laugh so much.  Archimedes, the Wolf, the aforementioned squirrel scene, the wizard duel (which by the way is often considered the best part of the movie & I agree); there's just so much to enjoy.  It also has some nice songs.  My favorites are the one during the squirrel scene and Higitus Figitus, which is one of my all-time favorite Disney songs.  Even though it's just various scenes attached together, it all seems to fit together perfectly.  I for one will always enjoy this movie.",1415836800,,1614,4.2947019867549665

306225,3,6300275310,"Based on the Arthurian legend, the King of England is dead and there is no heir to the throne. Magically, a sword appears in a stone proclaiming that whoever can remove it is the rightful ruler of England. Cut to young Arthur (voiced by Rickie Sorensen, Richard Reitherman, Robert Reitherman), a disrespected boy who is taken under the wing of the master wizard Merlin (Karl Swenson) who trains him for his future.

Having not seen this movie in quite a few years, I recently returned to it and found myself a little disappointed. I felt the animation was mixed. For one thing, often the characters look ""scratchy"" as if the final product was just traced pencil drawings. However, there are some really good pieces of animation such as the duel between Merlin and Madam Mim (Martha Wentworth). By far, the weakest part of the film is the plot, or rather the lack of it. For a movie that is only seventy-nine minutes long, it is incredible how much of it just feels like padding that does not progress the story any. Unfortunately, this only leads up to a very weak ending. The characters are a bright spot, though. They are likable and memorable, Merlin especially. It is rather annoying, however, that Arthur is played by three different actors and it is painfully noticeable.

All in all, this is a Disney film that is certainly worth checking out for people that love animation. It will certainly keep kids entertained for what it is, but the lack of a good story may leave adults disappointed.",1412553600,,1497,4.688212927756654

My grandson loves this movie, which is great as it isn't like some of the so-called children's movies that are out there today, which really are too violent for 6 year old's, but this one isn't. It shows how a child needs to learn how to pick the good ways to get out of trouble instead of fighting or shooting the 'enemy'.  It is a true classic and since it is animated with the old-fashioned cartoon graphics, children understand it isn't real. Some movies today seem too real for children to think they aren't, and they see and hear too much violent language and actions.  Not this movie.

306339,3,6300275310,"This is so far my least favorite disney animated film. The story is all over the place.  Most of the movie is just Merlin ""training"" Arthur by turning him into different animals and it all seems useless.  There's a part where he's turned into a squirrel and a female squirrel tries to rape him, but Merlin just laughs as if it's funny and we have to sit there and watch little arther being harrassed and violated for what seems like 10 minutes.  Virtually all of the songs are sung by Merlin so not much variety.  The story is leading up to a big tournament that never actually happens... and the sword the story is titled after isn't even a part of the story until the very end.  It's just weird and not written very well.  If you're a disney collector then I'm sure you'll get this anyway, but if you're just out to see some good animated films this is one to skip.",1390953600,,867,4.288343558282208

It really doesn't, 'cause this rendering of the tale has always been fun. Need I say more? Buy it, you'll like it! I did, and I do!

picture:
colors were decently vivid. black levels were fine. lines, however, seemed nearly wiped away at times and crispness was rare. it is, though, probably better here, on this blu-ray, than on any other format available. it still looks pretty good for what it is and how old it is. it could have gotten a better remastering, but i'm satisfied with what i got.

audio:
pretty good. more of a front-heavy sound mix (it is an older picture). regardless, dialogue was clear and sound effects were audible. generally, better than the picture.

overall:
Disney usually provides a sufficient amount of special features so, with that and the HD transfer, I'd say it's worth a buy if you're really into this movie, or if you want to expand your blu-ray/Disney collection. if not, it's skippable.",1383091200,3,819,4.877697841726619

306534,2,6300275310,"Disney Studios 18th full length animated feature film The Sword in the Stone is a sort of let down from the Disney studios. By this time Walt was busy with other projects and had little time to spend overseeing the animated films. The new Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all come accustomed to.

It's not that the artwork isn't beautiful, but it is a totally different style. The attention to detail just seems flat and the rougher lines on the drawing being exposed just comes off unfinished to me. This process worked well with Winnie the Pooh and 101 Dalmatians, but after ending the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, these films looks very 2 dimensional.

It doesn't help that the story is a little episodic and really doesn't draw the viewer in, but even as Blu Ray treatments go, this one has very little to offer, the extras? really not much devoted to the film. The transfer looks...well, I'll get back to that in a minute. It's kind of cool to see the film in widescreen for the first time. Why the full screen version wasn't included is beyond me as the extras are very thin and there is plenty of space for it here. Full Screen is actually the correct ratio regardless of how theaters presented this film. The Widescreen version looks cramped in a lot of scenes.

At first glance the picture looks very good, but overall the restoration is inconsistent with spots of blurriness here and there with smudged lines making the film look unprofessional, not something we associate with Disney animation. I'm not sure if there was damage to the film and or Disney didn't want to spend the time and money to do a really great job. There is no restoration feature on this set, so it's a mystery why this films looks like this and is such a disappointing release to Blu Ray.

I watched my Gold release edition again to compare and in my opinion the problem seems to be by presenting this film in Widescreen (which is 16:9 filling the screen) has put a magnifying glass on the animation and that along with Blu Ray clarity shows all imperfections and rough style in the process, it really doesn't do the film any favors. That along with some over scrubing or damage to the cells makes the details look soft or blurred.  The Gold release looks better even though the new release is brighter and more colorful. I would bet that even releasing this film as it is on Blu Ray in Full Screen would have made it look a little better because the picture wouldn't have been blown up so much.

It's hardly essential to your collection, but being a complete-ist I had to have it and I also like to see the studio's growth from film to film. The process called Xerography, which was revolutionary at the time was a process that took the animator's drawings and transferred them to celluloid. It looks very good until you compare it to the Disney hand painted classics.

Fortunately the studio got better at this process with The Jungle Book and Pooh, but this was a low period for the Disney studio in my opinion. With a lackluster release to Blu Ray and being one of Disney's least memorable films, whether this is an essential purchase is up to you, but keep your old Gold DVD edition because in a lot of ways it's better than this. I'll keep both.",1377734400,2,3399,4.544117647058823

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: With the release of Walt Disney's `The Sword in the Stone' in 1963, the studio initiated an unfortunate series of uninspired animated titles which, with the occasional exception, seemed to stamp its once unmatched animated features with a new label of mediocrity. It wasn't until `The Little Mermaid' in 1989 that the Disney name reclaimed its glorious title as the hallmark in animation, but by then, there was a quarter of a century of damaged reputation to undo. On its own, `The Sword in the Stone' isn't a terrible animated feature so much as it's a forgettable one. With no memorable characters or take-away songs from the music score, the film slightly lacks the magic and surprise, but still a nice looking animation, especially now in the stunning Blu-ray format, something none of its animated classics from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s were ever guilty of.

The sorcerer Merlin [Karl Swenson] knows that the young, fumbling page Wart [Rickie Sorensen] will one day rule England as King Arthur, but in order to get him ready, he subjects the lad to a series of experiences turning him into various animals in order to teach him valuable life lessons. With Merlin's wise owl Archimedes [Junius Matthews] as an assistant, Wart makes some progress in his lessons though his foster father Sir Ector [Sebastian Cabot] and foster brother Kay [Norman Alden] are none too happy to be losing their assistant as Kay prepares for a jousting tournament in London which will determine the new king since no one has yet been successful at pulling the enchanted sword from the stone which legend says will signify the rightful King of England.

Merlin's rather antic household magic is played strictly for laughs.  The three experiences where Wart is changed into a fish and a bird, both of which are used to teach him lessons about brain over brawn and contain a fair share of action and excitement, and a squirrel, where he learns the powerful lure of sensual attraction, are animated well but without the real depth of background and vibrant colour that distinguished earlier masterpieces. The showdown between Merlin and the evil Mad Madame Mim [Martha Wentworth] perhaps contains the closest thing `The Sword in the Stone' possesses to Disney's earlier brilliance in imagination and execution, but even its brain-over-brawn theme is repetitive after the previous animal-transformation sequences. And the Sherman Brothers' score, their first for a Disney animated feature, contains no memorable tunes. ""That's What Makes the World Go Round,"" the ditty used to teach the fish sequence lesson, is the most tuneful of the lot, and ""Higitus Figitus"" shows them coining their own words long before they arrived at Mary Poppins' famous magic word. ""Mad Madame Mim"" gives the evil witch her own expository melody while the title song, the most period appropriate of their efforts, might have been outfitted with additional sets of lyrics to comment on the story throughout the film and add a touch of dignity to the often lowbrow proceedings, especially the jokes about Bermuda shorts, films, and television.

As Disney did with PETER PAN,' an American actor, in this case Rickie Sorensen, has been cast to voice one of the most famous English characters extant, and it seems a dubious choice. He acts the role of the inexperienced, gangly lad Wart/Arthur just fine, but his vocal presence seems anachronistic in a Dark Ages-set story. Karl Swenson plays his absent-minded professor-like Merlin with the proper befuddlement, and Junius Matthews as the starchily efficient owl Archimedes makes a perfect polar opposite companion. Martha Wentworth has loads of fun as the cackling witch Mim while Sebastian Cabot and Norman Alden are just right as the thoughtless foster father and brother who treat Wart with uncommon indignity.

Arthur doesn't even become King until the end of the film when he eventually pulls the sword out of the stone, and then the movie just kind of ends. It's an all-around strangely-structured film that's structured around these whimsical set pieces of Arthur becoming a fish, then a squirrel and then a bird. He runs into trouble here and there, mostly from Mad Madam Mim, and a broken-hearted lady squirrel, which guts me every time I see the film, but it's just some light-hearted fun in the grand scheme of things. That's not entirely a bad thing though. I still enjoy the film, even though I can see its flaws a little more clearly now than I did when I was a child, but I still think it's a worthy animated film, and one that today's children should enjoy just as much as we did.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film is being presented in a 1.75:1 transfer at 1080p resolution. Sharpness is not always consistent throughout; occasionally in long shots the sharpness becomes momentarily soft and there also seems to be some motions blur which may or may not be related to Disney's digital tampering which is part of their customary treatment of their animated features on Blu-ray. Colour is nicely under control and is rich enough without any fear of blooming, though some orange/salmon backgrounds come close. There is a slight bit of banding to be seen, but it's never overpowering, and the line structures of the animation show no evidence of aliasing but do display a lack of fine detail due to the digital manipulations of the transfer.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix is quite definitely front centric with very little going on in the rear channels. Dialogue has been expertly recorded and resides in the centre channel. The music and sound effects never obfuscate the dialogue but are mixed skilfully to complement the animation. There is very little bass in this sound mix.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Never-Before-Seen Alternate Opening [1080p] [4:00] From Disney's vault comes a never-before-seen alternate opening in black-and-white storyboard form. It's a different take on how Wart meets Merlin.

Special Feature: Music Magic: The Sherman Brothers [2001] [480i] [8:00] The famed brothers Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman composer duo talk briefly about their careers and the memorable music they produced for Disney.

Special Feature: All About Magic [Excerpt] [480i] [7:00] A fun little piece from a Walt Disney hosted television show called 'All About Magic.'

Special Feature: Disney Sing-Along With The Movie [1980p] A sing-a-long feature created for the show's music.

Special Feature: Classic Animated Shorts [480i] [16:00] There are two great Disney shorts included here. One is a Goofy short called 'A Knight for a Day.' This is a 1946 Disney short film starring Goofy. Directed by Jack Hannah, this 7-minute animated comedy short was written Bill Peet. The other animation short is for one of my favourite Disney shorts of all time, Mickey's 'Brave Little Tailor.' This is a 1938 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The cartoon is an adaptation of the fairy tale ""The Valiant Little Tailor"" with Mickey Mouse in the title role. The film was directed by Bill Roberts and features original music by Albert Hay Malotte. The voice cast includes Walt Disney as Mickey, Marcellite Garner as Minnie, and Eddie Holden as the king. `Brave Little Tailor' was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 11th Academy Awards in 1939, but lost to Disney's own `Ferdinand the Bull.' In 1994 the film was chosen as the 26th greatest cartoon of all time by members of the animation field. The list was compiled in the book The 50 Greatest Cartoons.

Finally, `The Sword in the Stone' is a perfectly pleasant but sadly unremarkable animated effort from the Walt Disney Studios. The Blu-ray offers a picture which will please some but definitely annoy purists of Disney animation and with sound that's quite above average. The disc also ports over the unremarkable extras from the previous DVD release, but this is definitely at best a second tier Disney animation effort. But despite this, I am still glad I have added it to my Walt Disney Blu-ray Collection as you still get a magical adventure and with several repeat viewing, you get see other aspect of all what happens in the animation film and I will never be so negative about `The Sword In The Stone' as I love it and will give me endless hours of viewing pleasure. Highly Recommended!

The change in aspect ratio doesn't bother me as much as the woeful state of the video quality. It looks so over-processed to the point that detail is lost, everything has a slight blurriness, and color is over-saturated. It's bad enough to give you a headache after watching it for any length of time. The old DVD release looks so much better, and that version had a mediocre video transfer which gives you an idea just how bad this blu-ray is. I'm sure most kids won't care or notice, but if you are a collector or Disney fan, you WILL notice. Hopefully Disney will redo the transfer and issue a recall. Unfortunately, since this is considered a minor release in the Disney movie catalog, I'd be surprised if Disney fixed this situation.",1376265600,25,840,4.644295302013423

But more importantly, the picture quality is absolutely terrible, probably the worst looking animated title I've ever seen on Blu-ray.  It looks like someone used digital photoshop filters to clean up a Chinese vhs tape bootleg.

Anyone interested in this movie would be far better served just buying the old dvd or even laserdisc (if you have a LD player) off an eBay seller for a few bucks than waste your money on this ridiculously overpriced release.

306599,1,6300275310,"I buy a lot of Disney BDs - each and every one to be more exact and unfortunately ""The Sword in the Stone"" is Disney's worst Blu-Ray to date. Let's not debate about the movie itself. It might not be Disney's greatest effort, but it's an enjoyable fantasy movie, which certainly did not deserve this kind of treatment. Also let's not discuss the questionable aspect ratio choice (matted Widescreen instead of classic 4:3).

I hear reviewers complain about the heavy DNR applied to this transfer, but what many - even professional - sites fail to mention that this just isn't a HD transfer. This transfer has simply been upscaled from the SD transfer created for the DVD many years ago and that's definitely not something you would expect for a Disney classic like this one.

Other versions of ""Sword in the Stone"" like the downloadable ones have been upscales as well, but at least there they didn't apply aggressive DNR and they used proper video upscaler algorithms. The ""Sword in the Stone"" Blu-Ray has been upscaled using picture upscaling algorithms instead. If you know your Photoshop filters (Blow Up by Alienskin) you know the smearing effect they create. This is EXACTLY what SitS looks like.

The biggest problem of this release is that it makes us frequent and loyal buyers loose our trust in Disney's upcoming releases. Ok, I doubt that Disney will mess up titles like Arielle or any other Diamond release, but I certainly won't pre-order anymore of Disney's ""B-titles"", no matter if they're considered classics by the audience or not. If Disney willingly won't afford a new HD transfer for a classic like ""Sword in the Stone"", then I see many other great animated movies going the same way.

I looked forward to the new Blu-ray release and was shocked by what a clumsy butchery of the movie it is. Some people seem to think that the Sword in the Stone was designed by the Disney animators with an extra margin on the top and bottom of the frame so it could be viewed comfortably in either fullscreen or widescreen during the original release. I don't believe it. This is a fullscreen movie like Peter Pan, and was created to fit a fullscreen (1.33:1) aspect. This Blu-ray has been hacked top and bottom to pervert it into a widescreen version, it's an expensive mess.

Well, Disney finally proved to us consumers that it can, in fact, get worse than The Fox and the Hound blu-ray. Absolutely bottom of the barrel when it comes to the Disney releases thus far. Every single background is smeared and hard to look at, far away shots are smudgy and undefined, the colors are all over the map in terms of brightness and authenticity.

Each of those titles receiving the ""High-Definition re-mastering"" have produced a progressively worse viewing experience.  Keep your original DVD of SITS because it shows much more detail.  The blu-ray many times appears to be a child's paint by numbers project.  The definition/detail has been compromised due to Disney's desire to ""upgrade"" the old cell animation to digital.  They have gone crazy with the DNR scrubbing to remove the grain.  With the grain much of the detail has been removed as well.  It does not matter if the color has been boosted if the character's faces and the background are blurry.

306631,1,6300275310,"I have the 2001 DVD and viewed the 2013 Blu-ray. I watched 5 minutes and thought I forgot to wear my glasses...then I checked through the rest and then promptly returned it. I almost burst into tears, it was SO BAD!!! My favorite Disney film of all time. You know the blu-ray is bad when the old ""unmastered"" DVD looks amazing in comparison. On the blu-ray, the crisp black lines (the best part of the art) were rounded and thinned out...like someone ran all the blacks through autotrace. All the color details looked blotchy and blurry like a bad watercolor filter. It's like a pirated copy of a VHS tape burned onto disc. Embarrassing and YES, it's incredibly THAT poor in quality. Here's a good review that highlights the visual flaws: [...]

I'm willing to bet the powers that be do not like the rough black lines. History tells us that during that period, Disney studios discovered the xerox machine and that they could save $$$ by xeroxing the pencils right onto the cels and use them in the film. Thus it purposely LOOKS like graphite lines and some of the construction lines appear in and out of consecutive frames. Very much the style of famed lead illustrator, Bill Peet (he's done a ton of children's books in that same sketchy style). And very much NOT the fine painted colored outlines of other films like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty (totally different animation era, totally different illustration style).

Doesn't make it right to bastardize the original integrity of the film by any means, but it's a thought to match to a classic Disney style. And a VERY misguided one, I think.

Btw, I write this as my kid & I are watching the original 2001 DVD upscaled via blu-ray player on a large Sony flatscreen. Looks awesome.",1375833600,43,1736,4.666666666666667
306632,1,6300275310,"Disney should be ashamed!!!

The new Blu-ray of The Sword and The Stone is horrible, blurry mess!
I was ready to ""blind buy"" this Blu-ray, as I have with many Disney animated titles,
but the tools used to degrain (AKA DNR) this film removed so many details that the DVD now has superior picture quality
and more details and that should NEVER be the case.

The film is now blurry and details are GONE.  I hope Disney shows that they respect their animation fans and redoes this release
with a new transfer that represents the film and retains all the details and marks a significant improvement in picture
quality over the DVD, instead of a film with all the grain removed that also took out all the hand drawn details.

I no longer trust Buena Vista Home Video knows how to treat their own back catalog of films, and that greatly saddens and angers me.
If they hate their animated films, they will continue to do to them what they did to The Sword and The Stone Blu-ray release.
Only someone criminally negligent who has no regard for their own history would release a product like this.

Also, now the iTunes HD digital copy has been ""upgraded"" to the same horrible transfer that looks like the whole film was smeared with Crisco.

I have never returned a Disney Blu-Ray and asked for a refund - in fact, I have never returned ANY Blu-Ray based on quality and asked for a refund - but I will now.

I would rather watch my years old SD DVD than this horrific mess.  It's that bad, and the DVD is actually SUPERIOR quality.

I'm going to return my copy immediately.

306636,3,6300275310,"Disney pulls ""The Sword in the Stone"" out of the vault and gives it a high-definition transfer for its 50th Anniversary. The critically-acclaimed film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Score-Adaptation or Treatment, earning its right to a Blu-ray upgrade. It's also famous for being the last animated release before Walt Disney's death.

A young orphan named ""Wart"" wants nothing more than to be the squire to his older foster brother. Merlin the Magician sees more potential in the boy and begins training him for a greater destiny. ""Wart"" accompanies his brother to a tournament in London, where he will discover his true fate as Merlin's visions of greatness unfold.

We all know how it feels when you remember a movie one way from childhood and realize as an adult it's not quite as it seemed. That was my feeling as I watched Disney's ""The Sword in the Stone 50th Anniversary Edition."" Far be it for me to start slinging mud at what is considered to be a classic in the eyes of many. However, it became tedious watching Merlin the Magician teach ""Wart"" life lessons through turning himself and the boy into one animal after another and breaking into song.

I've never been a big fan of any musicals. I'm sure this factor has everything to do with my lack of enthusiasm for ""The Sword in the Stone."" My preferred version of the Arthur story would lean more towards the adventurous ""Excalibur.""

""The Sword in the Stone"" does contain quite a bit of magic. Some people with certain religious convictions will find this a good reason to steer clear of the movie. However, I would have to say that anyone who watches ""The Lord of the Rings"" films has no right to throw rocks at this one.

The audio and video transfers for ""The Sword in the Stone 50th Anniversary"" give viewers the best experience they've ever had with this film. The colors are vibrant and the picture is clean. The 5.1 surround sound gives home audiences the opportunity to experience it on a whole new level.

""The Sword in the Stone 50th Anniversary Edition"" includes some entertaining special features. There's an alternate opening presented here through the use of black-and-white storyboards. It also contains two classic featurettes entitled ""Music Magic: The Sherman Brothers"" and an excerpt from ""All About Magic"" hosted by Walt Disney. Two animated shorts and Disney's Sing-Along round out the bonus material.

My 7-year old loved ""The Sword in the Stone 50th Anniversary Edition,"" so maybe I've just outgrown it. He's watched it twice already, where I found it near impossible to sit through once. If children like it, does it really matter what this old reviewer thinks about it anyway? It's been proven time and time again that Disney movies are critic-proof.",1375747200,,2750,4.8382978723404255
306637,1,6300275310,"Well they messed this one up about as much one can. No one really knows what went wrong with the restoration, but the film is now blurry and ugly to look at for most of its runtime and is outdone by its 'older' iTunes HD counterpart and that is frankly pathetic. And even that release is being replaced with the newer 'restored' one. The sketchy artwork is clearly sourced from a dated master and has had all of its sharper qualities reduced to blobs in a decent portion of the picture because of EXCESSIVE DNR.

Sword in the Stone has been 'cleaned' within an inch of its life.... Easily the worst Disney transfer out there. We had some problems with Cinderella losing details to the DNR machine and we also had problems with a couple other discs. Fox and the Hound basically got very little restoration in parts and Aristocats + Rescuers had some softness but nothing to this scale. Those releases actually look quite good imho. This is just ridiculous.

After much debate, I consider the 60s films including Sword in the Stone and The Jungle Book to have some minor framing problems in the given aspect ratio here. Whether official or not I would still like to see a reframed 1.75:1 or better yet a 1.66:1 ratio more faithful to the elements of the film that have been chopped off. Sword in the Stone at 1.75:1, just like The Jungle Book, seems too congested for this aspect ratio. I'd say this one fares okay but it can still look awkward.

A 1.66:1 'middle ground' ratio like that of Aristocats or Fox and the Hound, which look great in that ratio, would have helped immensely to keep the original elements in play as much as possible while staying faithful to the theatrical presentation. Refer to recent comments for more in-depth discussion. Many people are still unsure of things related to how these films should look.

The OAR for the Xerography process (1961-1981) in Disney films is variable. They were animated at 1.33:1 so that when they were seen on TV they wouldn't be pan and scan, but they were also intended to be matted to a widescreen aspect ratio for theatrical runs. 1.75:1 is the booklet ratio suggested for theaters in America for the time by some accounts. 1.66:1 may have been popular in Europe. This doesn't obviously make what we have here truth, but we will never know what would be done today as the director and Walt Disney are dead.

I want to make it clear that this film is made unwatchable because of the DNR. I implore the reader to go to Bluray.com and read the review and then the forums to make up their own mind. The releases of 2013 including Robin Hood and Oliver & Company came out pretty well concerning their lower budgets. THIS ONE did not. The screencaps tell the story. It looks HORRID. Some scenes look okay but I'd say over 70% of it just looks like some upconverted garbage with way too much DNR applied. Disney applies DNR typically to make the cells appear as they originally were in their purest form; to get rid of the grain in other words so the animation looks as it did on the original cells. This goes way beyond that.

The film hasn't been preserved as it should have been. People need to at least start sending a message to Disney even if they do choose to purchase this. Sword in the Stone is a great animation film and a personal favorite of mine so I cannot let this go without a fight.",1375488000,241,3352,4.4868852459016395

I remember seeing this movie for the first time and being completely drawn in by both the characters and the story itself. Seeing it again after a number of years in the new Blu-ray format was a great experience and I have to say that Disney again did it right and brought out the best in the movie not for a new generation.

My family and I watched this together and I simply adored watching my daughters' eyes as they got into this film. They were completely entranced and afterward we talked about the folklore and the stories about Camelot and Arthur. After that the next time we went to our local library, guess what they wanted to look for - you guessed it - the same stories and folklore.

Disney has done a great job with this movie and whether you have seen it before or not, this is definitely a movie that I highly recommend!

306902,5,6300275310,"I must have watched this movie dozens of times in the first 5 or 6 years of my life, but as I watched it again at age 31 for the first time in many years, I realized how much The Sword in the Stone really is a part of who I have become. With the luxury of hindsight, I can now see how much Wart's (borderline naive) enthusiasm, his resilience to challenges, and his faith in all that is good, seems to have shaped my own view of life.

Archimedes the owl plays the role of the practical cynic, and while his knowledge and intelligence is valued by Merlin the Wizard, Archimedes' crusty skepticism is dislikable enough to encourage one not to give too much heed to naysayers and conventional wisdom. Wart's mentor Merlin, though scatterbrained, gets the important things right, like genuinely caring about people, giving of his self in service, and prioritizing things of lasting value--like wisdom, empathy, and righteousness--over the day-to-day urgent distractions that can easily crowd out time for the truly important. Merlin's primary objective seems to be the worthy cause of helping Wart to gain perspective and understanding by viewing the world through different points of view. These experiences help Wart (young King Arthur), to quickly gain the wisdom and judgement that would later become import to him as a leader.

Though I've been too cheap to buy many Disney movies, I splurged and got this because I wanted my kids to have these same good influences I did while their young minds are still so impressionable. As Mormon founder Joseph Smith said, ""teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.""  With so much smut out there in entertainment, we need more media (The Sound of Music, animated Robin Hood) that teaches correct principles.",1356134400,,1765,4.896321070234114

I also hate Sir Ector! He's obviously like Uncle Vernon from ""Harry Potter and a male version of Lady Tremaine; favoring their own biological kid while treating their UN-biological kid like a slave or absolutely nothing!

Obviously that means they took liberties with the story, and indeed they actually stop the story shortly after Arthur pulls the sword so you don't get the rest of the legend's parts, but for kids especially, this movie is tons of fun.

I was also quite amused to see many examples of classic Disney animation in the various animal transformation scenes. Keen-eyed viewers will recognize several animations that were apparently re-applied to Finding Nemo. I say that with 100% certainty, because I used to work in a store that showed that movie on a television multiple times a day, so I've seen it about 200 times.

If by some miracle you haven't seen this, here's some of what you have to look forward to: Merlin the magician in his tall pointy blue hat and long robe and long white beard, and his sidekick Archimedes the grouchy but wise owl; animated dishes and household objects (the first movie to have these I think) - and when he packs up his house everything flies through the air shrinking down and packing themselves in his suitcase; as a lesson for young Arthur he turns him into a fish and they have an adventure in the water and nearly get eaten; in another lesson he turns Arthur into a squirrel; in  another lesson he turns him into a sparrow and Arthur meets ""Mad Madame Mim"" an evil (but not scary) witch...and then there is a Wizards dual between Merlin and Mim which is just awesome!

It doesn't have the snappy remarks that Pixar and more recent Disney movies have - but it's not without humorous remarks. And I really love the ""lessons"" all kids can benefit from, but they're not preachy or like going to school.

306990,3,6300275310,"Again, I had not seen the entire movie before, and only saw it in black & white on the Disney TV show. It's fun, but I have to say it was improved by cutting it down to fit the hour-with-commercials format. Nothing of significance was lost.

Young Arthur, who is nicknamed Wort, is a page and scullery drudge in Sir Hector's castle. His greatest ambition is to become Sir Kay's squire. But Merlin takes him in hand, deciding he needs more than that for an education. Merlin, of course, already knows he is destined for greatness: he's been to the future.

Merlin not only turns him into a fish, then a squirrel, and finally a bird, he also turns himself into the same animals and accompanies Wort on his adventures. As a fish, he's chased by a huge pike that probably should not have been in the moat of the castle to begin with. As a squirrel, he's chased by a very determined girl squirrel. And as a bird, he is menaced by Mad Madame Mim. Merlin comes to rescue him, and he and Mim have a sorcerer's duel, which is the best part of the movie.

Sir Kay has been invited to a tournament in London which will choose the new king. Wort is his squire, but leaves Kay's sword at the inn. When he hurries back to fetch it, the inn is locked up because everyone is at the tournament. But Wort -- or should I call him Arthur? -- spies a sword sticking out of an anvil on top of a stone in the churchyard. Not realizing it's magical significance, he pulls it out and takes it to Kay. Since nobody else could pull it out, even when he replaced it, but he could pull it out easily, the prophecy is fulfilled and Arthur is proclaimed king.

There are some amusing touches concerning Merlin's knowledge of the future, which includes a loud pair of Bermuda shorts.",1336608000,,1751,4.313069908814589
306991,4,6300275310,"A charming old animation about King Arthur before he was king and just a boy of ten under the tutelage of Merlin, an ancient wizard, and Archimedes, a crabby sensitive owl who thinks he knows everything. Merlin can see the future and comments on a lack of electricity and plumbing as he's pulling water from a well with a pail. But Merlin does have objects that animate at his beck and call like serving tea so he's hardly slumming it.

A boy nicknamed Wart comes along and they teach him about using intellect over brawn, the power of love and remaining positive in the face of adversity. Most of the lessons are through shape changing Wart and Merlin into different animals (they can talk as those animals) and it seems there is always a predator after them which reinforces a lesson. There's a nice face off between Merlin and the goofy witch and the entire tale ends with Wart pulling the sword out of the stone and being proclaimed the new king. If you liked the artwork in ""Fantasia"" then you will like this artwork, too, thought ""Fantasia"" is a better piece. This is a fun movie for both adults and children even if a bit dated.

307064,3,6300275310,"The Sword in the Stone is one of those movies that a lot of people remember a key scene or two from, and nothing else. I have fond memories of watching the infamous magic duel when I was younger on a Disney Halloween special, but didn't see the movie until I was 8 or 9. I'm 26 now, and hadn't seen the movie at all since the early/mid-90s, but my daughter loved the magic duel when I showed her a clip of it, so I bought the movie hoping that she'd like it, and so I could see how it holds up. While the movie is a fun take on the legend of King Arthur, this is one of Disney's lesser entries from their second golden age. 101 Dalmatians and The Jungle Book are the films that Sword in the Stone is sandwiched between, and I don't think it's anywhere nears as good as those, though that doesn't make it a bad movie at all. It's just an all-around light tale: not heavy on action or plot, and it doesn't even really have a villain when it comes down to it. It's easy to see why so many people forget about this one.

The story centers on a young by named Arthur, but everyone calls him Wart for some reason. He's training to be a squire and wants to be a knight when he's older, but he's always being pushed around by his bigger brother. One day, he stumbles into the home of the legendary wizard, Merlin, who knows that Wart is going to be someone important someday. In fact, Merlin knows tons of things, as he's traveled to different countries...and in different time periods. Not satisfied by the idea of Wart becoming a knight, Merlin teaches him the importance if intelligence, by transforming him into different animals to teach him lessons. It's a weird method, but it gets the job done. Through these teachings, Wart begins to see that knowledge is power, as well as being quick on your feet (or fins and wings in some cases) and outsmarting your enemy. There also happens to be a seemingly holy sword planted in an anvil in town, and only the one worthy of being king will be able to pull it out. If you can't tell who that person is by the cover of the box, I don't know what to tell ya.

Doing a plot summary of The Sword in the Stone is kind of tricky since the movie really is just a couple of lessons that Wart learns, but done in a cool way. Like I mentioned earlier, there's no villain except towards the end, but it's just for two scenes. Wart's in danger numerous times when he's transformed into a fish, squirrel and bird, but it's just natural predators that he has to look out for. Of course these scenes are the ones that stand out the most, and the regular human bits are pretty forgettable, save for the pulling of the sword. Even now, just 3 days after having seen the movie, I can't really remember what happened in those non-animal scenes aside from bickering between Wart's dad and brother. The movie did managed to surprise me once with a very good lesson in love, and I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a bit heartbreaking when that lesson was over. Who knew that a squirrel that made squeaky sounds could be so emotionally powerful? And regarding the magic duel towards the end, now I can really appreciate the creativity that went into that scene, especially with how the animation team handled transformations. I can literally watch that scene ten times in a row and not get sick of it. But if you notice something, I'm not saying much about the characters, and that's because they're fairly easy to forget. Merlin could almost be the main character if he were featured a little more, and he has a couple of funny lines, but I never got attached to any of the characters...well, except for that poor squirrel. Man that scene hurt.

The picture and audio quality of this 45th anniversary edition are slightly above average. Since this isn't exactly in the same league as The Lion King or Sleeping Beauty, they didn't clean things up as well as they did for those releases. The aspect ratio is 1.33:1, and a lot of people are still up in arms over if that's the original way it was intended to be seen), but the colors and clarity are just fine. The 5.1 audio track doesn't do much since there's so little action here, and you won't be needing to adjust your speakers for anything. Everything's just plain, well...plain. Subtitles are available in Spanish and French.

Special features-wise, there's not a whole lot here worth checking out. The two features I got the most out of were the two classic shorts: Knight For A Day and The Brave Little Tailor. If you missed out on the Treasures collections that featured these, you're in for a treat, watching some classic Goofy and Mickey cartoons. Also included are a short look on magic with Walt Disney, an art scrapbook, film facts, a song selection feature, a game with Merlin, a short featurette showing how The Sherman Bros wrote the songs used in the movie (as well as 2 that didn't make the final cut), and trailers for other Disney movies.

I don't dislike the movie by any means, but if I were to make a top 15 of animated Disney movies, I don't think it'd make the cut. Is it worth checking out? Most definitely, if only for that duel scene. The Sword in the Stone isn't like most other Disney movies, since it doesn't have a real core problem that the hero needs to overcome, and the lack of a villain sure makes it stand out, but things could've been done a little better, especially the oddly abrupt ending. Kids should like it because of the animal transformations, and because it's fairly short, but there are still better ones out there, like 101 Dalmatians and The Jungle Book.",1309305600,2,5574,4.407766990291262

The film centers around a young stable boy named Wart who is chosen by a jolly old wizard named Merlin to learn the elements of the universe and help Wart achieve greatness. Along the way, Wart and Merlin encounter a feisty and happily evil sorceress named Madam Mim and Mim and Merlin square off in a battle of magic.

307071,3,6300275310,"This is one of those movies whose obscurity doesn't surprise me. This is a well-executed, beautifully-crafted movie, but its plot and pace never amount to what it promises.

This is the story of the upcoming King Arthur, more specifically when he is a little boy, employed as dishwasher for the local earl, whose pig-brained bully of a son is set to become the next king if no one can remove the sword Excalibur from its rock. Arthur's future looks bleak until eccentric wizard Merlin, along with his dry-witted owl Archimedes, arrives on the scene. Having travelled through time, Merlin knows Arthur's significance and sets to train him up to believe in himself through a series of field tests involving seeing himself in different situations. So Merlin changes Arthur into a fish and a squirrel, resulting in hilarious romping until Arthur stumbles upon the lair of the oddly fascinating albeit wicked witch Madam Mimm.

The trouble with this movie is that not much of significance happens. The plot seems pretty secondary. Most of the movie involves Merlin and Arthur on their little training missions. Excalibur plays a pretty small part indeed, and the movie doesn't really end on much of a high note, either, even though it's supposed to be one. So much more could have been done with the plot. This movie goes overboard with acting and forgets the plot. This A to B structure worked with the Jungle Book, but in the case of the Sword in the Stone, it's a point of storytelling that doesn't sustain itself.

Of course, what the movie lacks in plot it makes up for with visuals. They are stunning, I can tell you. The animation is beautiful and flowing, especially in the case of the wolf (a character I wish I had played more part in the movie) and the scene where Merlin and Mimm duel by turning themselves into all manner of creatures. In the hands of these people, this makes the Sword in the Stone worth a view for its visual excellence, making up somewhat for the thin story and development.

A pleasant, beautiful view, pretty low on substance but with a lot going for it in the visual department.",1299974400,2,2109,4.7073170731707314

The colors and audio are wonderful.  Perhaps my lone complaint (which some might consider to be rather petty), might be that the film could have been cleaned up just a tiny bit (as was wonderfully done for the Wizard of Oz).  While it isn't too noticeable, there were three or four scenes where tiny white specks were very noticeable (either as a result of aging, dust or scratches).  I would have thought these minor blemishes could have been eliminated on such a wonderful film.  On the otherhand, when you're young at heart and taken by the magic of this film, it's not likely you'd notice (or care about), this sort of thing.  Guess I just expected a bit more from Disney because some of their animated efforts today are simply marvelous and I hoped that that same technology would be used to cleanup up or restore these prints as much as possible.

307139,5,6300275310,"""The Sword in the Stone"" is a wonderful Disney picture.  Animated and only 79 minutes long, it is perfect entertainment for children and good solid entertainment for adults.

This movie is adapted from a book of the same title (written by T.H. White).  Mr. White's book follows the early life of a famous British folklore hero, King Arthur (a legendary monarch of the 6th century). Bill Peet, a Disney animator and writer, wrote the adaptation and did an outstanding job.  His writing is very very good.  The script is clever and insightful and it has a delicate charm and a depth of goodness.

According to the story, a sword is magically thrust deep into an anvil that sits on top of a large stone.  It is decreed (on the sword itself) that who-so-ever is able to remove the sword from the stone shall be anointed king of England.  Many men try ... but they all fail.  Then, after a long time has passed, a youth named Arthur appears on the scene and, miraculously, he pulls the sword from the stone ... and then is made ruler over all of England.

The story also includes another legendary character ... Merlin (a wizard & magician).  Merlin is wise, powerful ... and dotty.  He foresees the arrival of the twelve year old Arthur and he feels that it is fore-ordained duty to be the boy's teacher/mentor/companion to guide the lad toward some mysterious destiny.

Merlin, Arthur, and Merlin's pet owl Archimedes (who can talk) then embark on three magical adventures (the squirrel scene ... the second adventure ... is simply delightful).  After these ""educational"" adventures are completed the movie moves swiftly to the dramatic moment of Arthur and the sword.

Throughout the story there are, of course, bad guys (and bad creatures), but no danger is too serious or too scary and the bad guys are never allowed to win ... even temporarily.  Whether it is Sir Ector or Kay or a wolf, he (the bad guy) always falls victim to some misfortune (which is fun, of course).  Walt Disney was not always so benevolent in his films.  Take ""Pinocchio"" for example, where the bad guys are allowed to prevail for most of the movie (which definitely detracts from the movie's appeal).

The voice characterizations in ""The Sword in the Stone"" are very good.  Karl Swenson provides the voice of Merlin, and he is wonderful.  I guess it was his 30 years of experience in films and (more particularly) radio that enabled him to do such an excellent job, but it is a truly remarkable and enjoyable voice performance.  Junius Matthews does the voice for Archimedes the owl, and he is superb.  Sebastian Cabot provides the voice for Arthur's boisterous, self-important, crass, and uncouth master Sir Ector ... and this would be the usually refined, articulate, and dignified actor Sebastian Cabot (""We should call it 'Untidy Joseph' rather than 'Sloppy Joe'"" - from his role as Mr. French in ""Family Affair"").  Martha Wentworth does the voice of the evil Madame Mim ... and she is a delight!

All in all, ""The Sword in the Stone"" gives us very good entertainment, and it merits repeated viewings.",1255305600,2,3080,4.7443609022556394

307171,4,6300275310,"The Sword in the Stone is one hour and nineteen minute long and made its movie debut on December 25, 1963. The movie tells the story of a young boy named Arthur who would become future king of all England. The movie opens with the death of King Uther Pendragon dies and leaving no heir to the throne. There is a Sword in the Stone in London with the inscription the reads ""that whoever pulls it out is the rightful King of England."" Many men tried to pull the sword but failed. The sword is left there for years and forgotten. Fast forward to a number of years and Kay and Arthur (also known as Wart), who are foster brother, are on a hunting trip in the woods. Arthur causes Kay to miss the deer he was going to kill. Kay winds up shooting the arrow into the woods. Kay is angry with Wart and gives chase. Wart runs into the woods to retrieve Kay's arrow. Arthur finds Kay's arrow in a tree and when he tries to retrieves it falls through a hay roof and lands in Merlin's home. Merlin is tells Arthur that he has a great future ahead and takes it upon himself to tutor the young boy. The two head to Arthur's foster father home and at first Ector refuse to let Merlin stay. After Merlin causes a blizzard in the summer, Ector relents and gives him the guest quarters. Merlin and Archimedes (Merlin's talking and educated owl companion) would be the two who would educate the two. One day while Wart, Merlin and Archimedes are taking a walk around the castle, Merlin turns Wart into a fish as well as himself so they both can explore what lies beneath lake. Merlin teaches Wart how to swim like a fish and during the learning period they come across a pike fish (a fish with teeth). Merlin gets caught in a helmet and is unable to come to the boy's rescue. Arthur has to defend for himself and at one point is able to trap the pike. It is Archimedes who saves Arthur and Merlin emerges from the moat as a human and changes Arthur back into a boy. When Arthur tries to tell Ector and Kay what he has experience but the both don't what Arthur is saying. Ector gives him six demerits and sends Wart to the kitchen for cleaning duties to work off the demerits. Later that day Merlin appears and asks Arthur if he would like to be a squirrel. Arthur would like to but tells Merlin he can't because he has to work off his demerits. Merlin cast a spell in the kitchen so the dishes can clean themselves and the two head out to the woods to become squirrels. They both encounter the opposite sex and try to shake them off. While trying to escape from the female squirrel, Arthur gets his tail stuck in a branch and a wolf heads after Arthur. The female squirrel comes to the rescue and the wolf falls into a river below the cliff. Both Merlin and Arthur become human again and the female leave crying. When Arthur arrives back at the castle back at the castle Ector accuses Merlin of using black magic to wash the dishes and Merlin vanish into thin air. Arthur defends Merlin but Ector punish the boy and tells Kay that a new squire is going to London with him. Later that evening Merlin appears and tells Arthur that he is sorry but things can only look up and that starting tomorrow his education will begin. At Merlin's quarters, it is discovered that Arthur can't read or write and Archimedes winds up teaching the boy to read and write. During spelling lesson Merlin tries to fly a model airplane but his long beard causes the plain to crash. Archimedes is beside himself with laughter and Arthur looks out the window and wonders what it is like to fly. Merlin turns Arthur into sparrow and Merlin and Archimedes quarrel over who would be a better teacher to teach Arthur how to fly. Archimedes wins the debate and during the course of his lesson a giant hawk gives chase to those two. Arthur falls down a chimney shaft while trying to escape from the hawk. Arthur winds up at Mad Madam Mim's cottage. Mim find that Merlin has an interest in the boy and that is bad in her mind. It is during this time that Archimedes flies back to alert Merlin on what has happen to the boy. Just as Mim was about to eat Arthur, Merlin arrives to rescue the boy. Mim challenges Merlin to a Wizard's Duel. During the duel Mim cheats and turns into a dragon and captures Merlin. It is Merlin who has the laugh last. Merlin turns himself into a rare germ that makes Mim breaks out into spots and suffers from hot and cold flashes. Merlin wins the duel and the trio head back to the castle. It is late winter and the boy who replaces Arthur as Kay's squire comes down with the mumps. Ector tells Arthur that he is now Kay's squire. Arthur rushes to tell Merlin about the news, but is so upset with Wart that he accidently shoots himself to 20th century Bermuda. At the tournament Arthur tells Kay that he left his sword at the inn. Arthur heads back to the inn to get Kay's sword, but the in is lock. Archimedes sees a sword in a stone and pulls it out of the anvil. Arthur heads back to the tournament to give Kay the sword. Kay realizes it is not his sword and Ector realizes it is the Sword in the Stone. Ector asks Wart where he got the sword and Wart tries to explain. The crowd head back to the place where the sword came from. Ector puts the sword back into the anvil and just as Wart is about to pull the sword Kay pushes him aside and tries to pull it out himself. Several other men gather around to try to pull the sword but fail in their attempts. It is Sir Bart says let give the boy a try. Wart goes to the stone and pulls the sword from it. Sir Bart asks for the boy names and tells him it is Arthur. Sir Bart yells ""Hail!! King Arthur!!"" In the closing scene Arthur convinces himself that he is not ready to be king and tries to escape but is unable to. Arthur cries out for Merlin and Merlin enters the movie again saying the 20th century is a mess and they can have it. Archimedes tells Merlin the Arthur has pulled the sword from the stone and he is now king of all England. The films end with Merlin telling Arthur's future and his Knights of the Round Table and the picture fades with Merlin trying straightening a crown that is too big for Arthur. This movie would be the last movie release when Walt Disney was alive. Walt would be involved with the Jungle Book but died a few days before it release. Overall the movie is good but I just thought the ending could have been better. The Sword in the Stone gets a B+.

307174,3,6300275310,"The Sword in the Stone is not one of those animated features that bubbles to the top of anyone's list when they talk of classic Disney. Based (very sketchily) on T.H. White's ""The Once and Future King"", the plot is as sketchy as the artwork on the main characters. This is one of those, like ""The Jungle Book"" where the artwork for the background and settings is several degrees more elaborate and detailed than that of the characters.

Wart, or Art is a neglected drudge and scullery boy in the castle of Sir Ector, befriended by Merlin, a wandering wizard with a pet owl named Archimedes. By way of giving him an education, Merlin turns the boy into successively a fish, a squirrel and a bird. There are lessons to be learned from those experiences, apparently. It climaxes with a battle of wits between Merlin and a rival witch, Madame Mim, and at the very end, Wart pulls an ancient sword out of the stone and is revealed to be the rightful king of England. It's a slight and barely amusing story, and seems to have been cranked out by Walt Disney while he had his mind seriously set on something else.  Two of the extra features - Goofy as a knight at a joust, and Mickey Mouse as the Brave Little Tailor were by far more witty and energetic in about a tenth of the time.

Other notable extras on this feature is an interview with the Sherman brothers. This was the first time they worked with Disney; none of the songs are particularly memorable.

307179,2,6300275310,"I remember liking this movie quite a bit as a child, which was my sole motivation for purchasing it for my own two children.  We sat and watched it together (or tried to).  The youngest one wandered off about ten minutes into it and the older one was distressed over the pink squirrel left to cry her eyes out in the tree after one of Merlin and Wart's (Arthur) shape changing sessions.  She kept asking me ""Mommy why is the squirrel crying?  Why don't they make her happy?""  and so forth....and I could only answer with ""I don't really know"".  It just seemed cruel hearted.

Everyone knows the overall plot (or should).  The movie feels disjointed though, the shape changing bits being the best (fish, squirrel, bird) culminating in the scene where Merlin pits his skills against Mad Madam Mim.  The actual sword pulling and becoming king happens in the final moments of the movie.  It's all very underwhelming.

The animation is fair, the plot rather slow and boring (bits and pieces that don't add up to a satisfying conclusion), characters left undeveloped, the music being below average to downright embarrassing...there are alot of problems with this one.  But it is fairly entertaining and atleast worth a single watch.  However, this one is not destined for infinite replays like other Disney classics in my house are (Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, 101 Dalmations, Robin Hood, The Aristocats being some of the top favorites - for comparision's sake)",1225065600,6,1456,4.893877551020408
307221,3,6300275310,"WARNING! Spoiler Alert - Am I the only one who feels sorry for that cute little female squirrel that becomes infatuated with the transformed young Arthur only to have her heart broken when he's turned human again? As silly as this may seem, this is the one reason why I do NOT like this film. Yes, there is a tough life lesson to be learned in this sequence and yes it is a testament to the effectiveness of Disney's storytelling and animation, but c'mon! Maybe the scene would've lost its poignancy if the story allowed for another male squirrel to be smitten with the heartbroken female, but ask yourself, would you have enjoyed ""Dumbo"" as much if his mom was never released from her cage? Apples to oranges, I know.

Anyway, other than my gripe about the aformentioned scene, I thought this was a fun movie overall. The animation is typical of Disney's high standards even though I thought the songs were a bit lackluster. Not in the same league as ""Peter Pan"" or ""Alice In Wonderland,"" but not as bad as ""The Black Cauldron"" either.

If Disney ever does the smart thing and decides to start releasing traditionally animated features again, they should do right by that squirrel and get her a boyfriend!",1221868800,4,1206,4.630841121495327

307224,3,6300275310,"This is a wonderfully produced release of one of the weaker full-length films produced during Walt Disney's lifetime.  I know that doesn't mesh with many of the reviews here, but I just find very little to enjoy in this particular film.  There is no real story, with a particularly weak script by the usually marvelous Bill Peet (the most versatile individual from the Golden Age of Disney, sometimes designing characters, sometimes writing screenplays, sometimes directing).  The film consists of a series of largely unconnected vignettes where Merlin is ostensibly educating the future King Arthur.  I did not care for this film when I was a small child and I find that I haven't come to care for it as an adult.

On the other hand, I'm sure that many kids will get a huge blast out of this.  One of my daughter's favorite Disney films as a small child was ROBIN HOOD, which is probably my least favorite Disney film ever.

Certainly this release makes the film look more beautiful than it ever has before for home viewing.  This was one of the first films I watched on my new high def TV and I was just delighted with how vivid the colors were.  As with most Disney rereleases there were also many interesting special features.

I would, however, only recommend this to someone who is a bit of a completist, dedicated to owning all of the Disney films on DVD.  There are just so many other films that one ought to own first.  Not counting collections of short subjects, there must be a solid fifteen to twenty DVDs that one would want to collect before this one.  Still, I'm sure almost any kid will love it.  I'm just not confident that most adults will.",1220659200,3,1658,4.576271186440678

307227,5,6300275310,"As other reviewers have duly noted, this film (first released in 1963) is based on the first of four parts of T.H. White's The Once and Future King (1958), focusing on Arthur's birth, childhood, and youth before he became king of England. The film has been reissued as a 45th anniversary edition. It features the well-selected voices of Sebastian Cabot (Sir Ector/Narrator), Karl Swenson (Merlin), Rickie Sorensen (Arthur/""Wart""), Junius Matthews (Archimedes), and Alan Napier (Sir Pelinore). Frankly, I was underwhelmed when I first saw it many years ago and had little patience with the antics. While seeing it again recently, I found the film much more entertaining and frequently charming.

In our family, a film's ""acid test"" for grandchildren is for them to want to see it again, immediately. After I watched it with several of the younger ones, they requested that but agreed, instead, to check out ""Merlin's New Magical Academy Game,"" passing on the other bonus features.  I would not rank The Sword in the Stone among the ""classic"" animated features produced by Disney (e.g. Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, Dumbo, Pinocchio, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) and Pixar (e.g. Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and WALL-E) as well as DreamWorks' Antz and Shrek. However, how many animation features do?

Perhaps there are other grandparents and parents who also saw The Sword in the Stone years ago, as did I, and are not inclined to have a copy available for children to see. I urge them to reconsider because it possesses a unique ""magic"" of its own. I think they will also enjoy the bonus features. Hopefully this reissued version will attract the interest and gain the appreciation the film clearly deserves.",1215820800,2,1736,5.0
307228,4,6300275310,"Made in 1963 and based upon the 1938 story of the same name by Terence H. White, THE SWORD IN THE STONE was Disney's attempt to bring the legend of King Arthur under the Disney banner.  The film begins with the wizard Merlin talking with his owl, Archimedes. Merlin is awaiting the arrival of a young boy who he wants to train and educate so he is prepared for his exciting future.  The boy, nicknamed ""Wart"", literally falls through Merlin's roof.  Merlin immediately begins Wart's education and returns with the boy to the castle where he resides as a squire for the son of his guardian.

THE SWORD IN THE STONE isn't as well known as many other Disney animated features.  However, I remember watching the film on television as a child and there were a couple of scenes that stuck out in particular.  The first was when Merlin turns himself and Arthur into squirrels.  Arthur meets a young female squirrel and while trying to avoid her, causes her to fall in love with him.  I'm not sure why, but I found that particular episode fascinating; what would you do if you could magically turn into an animal and a creature of the same species but of the opposite sex wanted to mate with you?

The second scene that stood out to me was the wizards duel between Merlin and the evil witch Mad Madam Mim.  Merlin uses magic to help others while Mim uses magic for destruction and to hurt others.  The duel is brought to a conclusion with some very creative thinking from Merlin.

Overall, though perhaps not as memorable, fascinating, or memorable as many other animated Disney films, THE SWORD IN THE STONE is an entertaining movie that families with little children can sit and watch together.  It does stray from some of the more popular Arthur legends, but it may intrigue youngsters enough to cause them to investigate other Arthur stories.  Also, the film is the first Disney animated feature with songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman.

Many Disney Platinum and Anniversary DVDs have been lacking in the extras department. There are actually some really good extras on this disc, especially considering THE SWORD IN THE STONE is a lesser-known Disney picture.  There are two wonderful shorts on the disc.  The first is ""Knight for a Day"".  It features Goofy in a slightly different form as a medieval squire who has to take over when his knight ""disappears"" just before a joust.  The second cartoon short on the disc is the classic ""Brave Little Tailor"".  This short stars Mickey Mouse as a tailor who after a bit of misinterpretation is sent to slay a giant.  If he's successful, the King has promised him riches beyond compare as well as the hand of his true love, Princess Minnie.  I remember first reading this story in a volume of Disney storybooks as a child.  It was one that stuck with me through the years and I fell in love with the short when I saw it on television years later. ""Brave Little Tailor"" also has a cameo by Pluto, but not in his now-familiar dog on four legs form.

In addition to these two great shorts, THE SWORD IN THE STONE 45th ANNIVERSARY DVD includes a featurette with the Sherman Brothers discussing and performing the two songs they wrote for the movie, but that were cut.  Other extras include a song selection feature; a trivia game about the film entitled ""Merlin's Magical Academy Game"" that's surprisingly fun to play a few times; a clip of Walt Disney performing magic tricks; and a ""making of"" featurette.",1215820800,4,3452,4.6381578947368425
307229,2,6300275310,"What happens when you take Disney, the story of King Arthur before he pulls the sword, TH White, mix them together and make a movie?

A movie that sucks.

How did that happen?

By following the book.

The movie version of Sword in the Stone has a young Arthur meeting a goofy Merlin the Magician who gives life lessons while turning Arthur into various animals of various species with singing and dancing.

It's dull, dreary, not cute, and at 79 minutes, way too long. Yeah, Sword in the Stone follows the book, and that's great.  It is good when movies follow the book, but sometimes what we get instead is nothing more than a silly children's movie rather than a decent telling of Arthur pulling the stone.

The Sword in the Stone is Disney-Lite and not nearly as good as it could or should be.  Let me phrase that differently: The Sword in the Stone is not good, as it should have been.

There are special features on the disc. This is normally where I would talk about them, but special features only matter if the movie is worth seeing.

The Sword in the Stone is not.",1215820800,5,1073,4.401015228426396

Only a 1 disc package.  NOT a lot of extras.  No making of special or anything.  Only extra of interest to me is a segment on the Oscar winning Sherman Brothers.

True, this film was not a big box office hit for the studio so you can understand why no real special package here in my opinion.

BUT, the studio did market it for the 45th anniversary so you would think there would have been something more special about this DVD release.",1215648000,,633,4.35042735042735

There are a lot of people in this world you can't trust, but I always figured Disney was above all of this...well Walt Disney was.

Now everyone is just out for as much money as they can get.  Re-releasing this cute movie as a 45th anniversary special DVD is nothing more than trying to scrape in those dollars. Even at $20.00 it's not worth it.

And just for general purposes, I'm sick and tired of buying any type of DVD, Movie, Video that contains ads to buy even more of their products.  Most people just fast forward through them anyway.

We are inundated with commercials on TV and now on movies we buy.  I would love to put in a DVD and have the movie start without seeing all the hype.

307262,4,6300275310,"Well, it has a very nice box. Looks nice on the DVD shelf. And it commemorates the 45th anniversary of one of Walt Disney's least-heralded animated features.

The only new item is a game called ""Merlin's Magical Academy Game,"" which features a very nice vocal recreation in tribute to the late Karl Swenson. There is also a sing-along for every song this time around, as opposed to the two pick-ups from the earlier DVD release from the VHS ""Sing Along"" series.

One bonus feature is actually shorter than it was in the Gold Collection -- the 1957 ""All About Magic"" segment from Walt Disney Presents. In the earlier DVD, it was presented in its entirety. On this edition, we only see the opening segment. It fades after Walt introduces the magic mirror.

Bonuses aside, The Sword in the Stone is really much better than it gets credit for. Maybe not a classic, but very entertaining and masterfully animated. And even though the great Sherman Brothers can't really muster much enthusiasm for the finished film in their bonus segment (apparently it took a different direction than they had expected and songs and ideas were omitted), it is the first Disney feature with a Sherman score. To their credit, the songs truly support and advance the story, seamlessly and carefully woven into the action -- a quality often attributed to other Disney films, such as Peter Pan, but never to Sword in the Stone.

The film also features a fine voice cast of actors chosen for their suitability instead of their celebrity, which for better or worse, came to an end with The Jungle Book. Especially outstanding are the radio-trained Junius Matthews, who later played Rabbit in the early Winnie the Pooh films, Martha Wentworth as Mim (I've always wondered if Mim's ""beautiful"" appearance is a caricature of Mary Blair) and of course Swenson, who also played Lars Henson on Little House on the Prairie.

So if you never bought this on DVD before, it looks and sounds wonderful on this edition, and if bonus features are no big deal to you, it's a ingratiating, underrated Disney gem.",1214438400,5,2069,4.800561797752809

The color seems livelier (the movie has been digitally restored by Disney) and the music brought SO many memories as the story evolved before my eyes..

This is definitely not the best Disney movie ever, but it beats most animated movies that come out these days. Couple that with a nice combo of bonus features, including a couple of classic Goofy and Mickey animated clips and you are set for a couple of hours of good ole' Disney fun with the family.

307267,4,6300275310,"This 1963 adaptation of the children's classic book of the same name, which was written by Terence H. White and first published in 1938, tells the story of a young King Arthur. The plot of the book provides the underpinnings for this animated film. In the film, Arthur is a twelve year old squire to the numbskull son of his guardian. Naive and genuinely nice, he is known by the nickname ""Wart"".  Merlin, the wizard of all wizards, takes him under his wing, seeking to educate young Arthur before he enters into legend. Wart has no clue what fate holds in store for him, when he goes to London to perform his duties as a squire. Little does he know about the sword in the stone and the legend that surrounds it. Is he in for a surprise!

This film is not as well known as other Disney animated films and has never had the acclaim of some of the others. Yet, it provides solid entertainment. The animation, as it is with all Disney animated films, is excellent, despite lacking the elegance of some other Disney animated classics.  My favorite scene is that involving the evil sorceress, Mad Madam Mim, a scene that I simply loved. It is a scene that is totally funny, whimsical, and action packed. Having never seen this film before, I was pleasantly surprised by it. The seventy nine minutes that the film lasted passed all too quickly.  Moreover, it is a film that the whole family may enjoy.

The 45th Anniversary edition comes loaded with many bonus features. My favorite feature was the inclusion of two classic cartoons. Both cartoons selected for inclusion follow the medieval theme of the film. The first cartoon, ""Knight for a Day"" dates back to 1946 and features ""Goofy"" as a medieval squire. With his master out of commission due to a mishap, Goofy takes his master's place at a joust that is to decide who will win the hand of the Princess. The second classic cartoon ""Brave Little Tailor"",  dates back to 1938 and features ""Mickey Mouse"", who is deemed by his King to be the official giant killer, when Mickey overstates his fighting ability. Asides from a bucketful of money, if Mickey is successful in routing the giant, he will win the hand of Princess Minnie. I totally loved these two cartoons. To me, they turned this DVD into a must buy DVD.",1214092800,5,2262,4.57283950617284
307268,4,6300275310,"Released in 1963, ""The Sword in the Stone"" was based on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/0399225021/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>&nbsp;of the same name by T.E. White, and tells how the great wizard Merlin took under his wing the future King Arthur, at this point a young lad nicknamed Wart.  Feeling no need to wait five more years for a round-number, watching this 45th Anniversary Edition DVD of ""The Sword in the Stone"" really strikes me as being a third tier Disney animated feature film.  It occurs to me that whereas with some of the best children's films, animated or otherwise, you can claim that it is too good for kids (mainly because some of the best bits are way over the heads of the little folk), that is not the case with this one.  With the lessons on perspective taking Merlin puts Wart through there is certainly something for kid's to take away from watching the movie.  But adults?  Not so much, which would explain why watching the film again many decades later did not match up with fond memories of originally seeing it in the theater.  This time around I was rather put off by many of the comic twists with Merlin, and found the final joke of the film with the character in Bermuda shorts to be the lamest of all Disney endings.  The last Disney animated feature released when Walt Disney was still alive, it is part of what is called the ""English Cycle"" of Disney animated films that includes ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B00004R99L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Pan/dp/B000JBWWRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Pan</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jungle-Book/dp/B000OLGCI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jungle Book</a>,"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood/dp/B00004R99Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood</a>,"" all of which are superior, to greater or lesser degrees, than this one.  This would tend to reaffirm the notion that this is a lower tier animated Disney movie, but the key word there is ""Disney,"" which means the bottom of their barrel is still located up there in the penthouse.

The fact that there is but a single DVD this time around is another clear indication that this is not a top tier Disney film, because it lacks the sheer quantity of stuff from ""Vault Disney"" that we find on the recognized classics.  The high points of the special features are the bonus shorts, which start with Goofy's ""A Knight for a Day""(1946), directed by Jack Hannah, where Cedric (Goofy) replaces his master, Sir Loinsteak, in the joust against Sir Cumference (best pun on the whole DVD).  But then we get the classic Mickey Mouse cartoon ""Brave Little Tailor"" (1938), directed by Bill Roberts, that was nominated for the 1938 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (It lost to Disney's ""Ferdinand the Bull"").  When animators voted on the top 50 cartoons (shorts) of all-time, this one ended up #26 on the list (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-Opera-Doc/dp/B00020SK1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's Opera Doc?</a>"" is #1, Disney's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Band-Concert/dp/B00005KARD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Band Concert</a>"" is #3, and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bambi-Meets-Gozilla/dp/B000NLD7RE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bambi Meets Gozilla</a>&nbsp;"" made it to #38, so its a nice eclectic list).  The Games and Activities section has viewers solving problems to collect ""relics"" (shields); my ability to answer history questions far outstrips by swimming ability.

In the ""Magic Music: The Sherman Brothers"" featurette in the Music and More section they look at the songs that were dropped from the movie, and given the main lesson of the film it is a shame the song ""Magic Key"" was dropped, because it is really on point regarding the importance of learning.  There are also captioned versions of all of the songs in the film, so that you can sing along.  In the Backstage Disney section, Walt Disney shows up for an excerpt from ""All About Magic,"" which is not exactly on point for ""Sword in Stone"" but does cover basic movie magic.  The Scrapbook section has concept art, behind the scenes looks, publicity shots, and the Merlin Show attraction at Disneypark Paris, where you can click on pictures to enlarge them.  The Film Facts section is rather sparse, consisting of just eight frames of text, again indicating that we are not dealing with one of the shining moments in the history of Disney.  Still, the extras are enough to round up on this one, and those trying to put together a complete Disney library will be happy to find that the company puts out above average DVDs of even their average animated films.",1214006400,4,5028,5.881868131868132

307270,3,6300275310,"Released Christmas Day 1963, Walt Disney's ""The Sword In The Stone"" is the studio's ""in-between"" film in its ""London cycle"" (six UK-set films over 20 years, 1952-1972). It retells King Arthur's (here called Wart) apprenticeship under Merlin the Magician and his path to the throne, drawn from T.H. White's 1938 fantasy novel.

The film, re-released on DVD in a 45th Anniversary edition, zigzags through British folklore and character while name-dropping out-of-place modern touches. (Merlin anticipates airplanes and steam locomotives, yes. Merlin in Bermuda shorts calling movies ""TV without commercials,"" no.)  It lacks the historic focus, whimsy or cheeky humor of ""101 Dalmatians"" or ""Mary Poppins."" Those films preceded and followed ""Stone"" in release, romanticizing modern-day and Victorian Britain and staying beloved in theater and video re-releases. They, unlike ""Sword,"" stayed cohesive and, well, sharp.

But despite lack of critical praise at release and relative low standing in Disney's canon, ""The Sword In The Stone"" isn't a total stick in the mud. It features some fine animated sequences (Mad Madam Mim's delightfully cruella solo to young Wart as a sparrow, and her clever, multi-colored wizard's duel with Merlin.) Disney regulars Sebastian Cabot and Thurl Ravenscroft join Alan Napier (remember Alfred the butler from the 1960s ""Batman"" show?) in a uniformly fine voice cast. Richard and Robert Sherman (honored in a humorous DVD extra) contribute some catchy, nonsensical compositions (led by Merlin counting off like Lawrence Welk and including some trademark bubbles)!

Other DVD extras include medieval-themed shorts (the better being Mickey Mouse's ""The Brave Little Tailor""), a DVD art scrapbook and game, ""Merlin's Magical Academy"" (yours truly's son played it and said, ""It was all right."") Overall, ""Sword In The Stone"" is nowhere near the roundtable of Disney's classics, modern or otherwise.

Isn't that what Walt Disney had in mind? It wasn't until years later and I had my own child that I began to realize that not many people even remembered THE SWORD IN THE STONE or knew it even existed. I was rather flabbergasted by this not to mention all the bad press this film had received as I started researching it. My most cherished copy of this film has always been on Laserdisc, but now it looks like THE SWORD IN THE STONE is finally getting some well deserved recognition.

307302,4,6300275310,"It is wonderful that this lesser-known film in the Disney vault is getting a special edition. It has the distinction of being the last animated film to be released while Walt was still alive. Narrated by the loveable Sebastian Cabot, it is a truly entertaining tale about magic and coming-of-age. Central to the story is the relationship between Merlin the magician and a boy named Wart, the future King Arthur. Merlin grooms the boy and takes responsibility for his education, culminating in the scene where Wart attempts to pull the (unbeknownst to him) legendary sword from the stone. ""The Sword in the Stone"" cleaned up at the box office but was not really a hit with the critics. However, it holds up very well, and despite what others have called ""cheap animation,"" it is a beautifully drawn film that obviously patterned itself after ""Sleeping Beauty."" The xerox method used in ""Dalmatian"" is used here again; it doesn't have the same pristine & clean quality of ""Peter Pan,"" yet it does preserve the fresh sketch quality of what was originally drawn. Just a difference in style; neither better nor worse. The film also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Score, although the songs in the film are definitely less than memorable.

Extras include the usual Backstage Disney assortment, such as from ""Walt Disney Presents: Fantasyland - All About Magic,"" an excerpt from the BW TV Show, with Walt having a ball going through the Magic Room of the ""basement,"" playing with all kinds of different parlour tricks. The decapitated princess is a little eerie, but it's all very fun. Nice cameo by Snow White's Magic Mirror, too. The Production Notes section gives fun facts about the development of the film (including the fact that Bill Peet based his characterization of Merlin on Walt!). There is also a wonderful scrapbook gallery of images from concept to publicity, with explanatory text. 2 bonus color movie shorts: Mickey Mouse in ""The Brave Little Tailor"" and Goofy in ""A Knight for a Day."" For the music sections, the Sherman Brothers are in a featurette ""Music Magic"" where they discuss the development of the songs for ""Sword in the Stone,"" as well as tunes that were discarded. The songs from the movie are also able to be accessed directly from this section by name. The least of the extras on this DVD is the Merlin's Magical Academy Game. Your basic answer a few questions to ""win."" There are also a few parts to the game where you must hit the arrows on your remote control to match the arrows on the screen; this part is a little confusing, as there is no way to know if you are playing correctly or not; the arrows do not change color or shape when you hit them, so until you get to the end of the game, you have no idea if you are doing it right. And the ""prize"" at the end is a little bit of a snoozer, just like the game itself. Overall though, the extras are more than what has been advertised and a very nice selection, too.

Definitely a nice special edition!",1213488000,3,2994,4.657844990548204

307304,3,6300275310,"****Blu-ray update*****
The new Blu-ray release is an improvment over the first DVD release, except it crops off the top & bottom of the picture. The Sword In The Stone was filmed 1:37-1 Full Frame.
While the Blu-ray is not as sharp as other Blu-rays, this may be an issue with the original film elements.
I saw no real improvement in the colors, just a slight change in the hue, the brightness is still the same.  Not outstanding.
Negative specs that show up in the original DVD have been cleaned up (but a small amount of detail was sacrificed in the clean up).
I will still keep my old DVD to watch the FULL FRAME image.

As far as bonuses, Disney has added some new deleted scenes, that alone would make upgrading to Blu-ray worth it.

----------Original Review-------------

If you did not get the previous DVD release, then this is worth getting.  Disney claims this will be letterboxed 1:66-1, if it is anything like Jungle Book, this will be a mistake.

There is little reason to buy this if you already own the first FULL FRAME release.  Most of the bonuses listed below were on the previous release, and that earlier release was nicely restored.  I doubt Disney will do any further restoration.

BONUS FEATURES
* All-New Merlin's Magical Academy Game - In this all new game Merlin tests viewers' knowledge of the world as they are transformed into a fish, a squirrel and an owl--just like Wart in the movie.
* Knight for a Day - Goofy stands in for his master at a joust in this medieval themed short film. ***Also on the previous DVD release, and the ""Complete Goofy"" DVD set.***
* Brave Little Tailor - When Mickey tells a white lie about his fighting prowess, he ends up facing down a rampaging giant. ***Also on the previous DVD release, and the Mickey Mouse In Color DVD set.***
* Music Magic: The Sherman Brothers - A profile of the musical geniuses behind The Sword in the Stone and so many other Disney hits. Includes the deleted song, ""The Magic Key."" ***Also on the previous DVD release.***
* The Sword in the Stone Scrapbook - An exclusive behind-the-scenes interactive program featuring still-frame galleries and film facts. ***Also on the previous DVD release***
* Disney Song Selection
* And Much More!

The movie itself falls a little short of being a classic, it is the beginning of the weak period.  Walt still had his hand in this, but he was more focused on his television show.  Even the Sherman Brothers admit their music was below par, but they were new at scoring movies.",1209600000,9,2504,4.614864864864865
307305,4,6300275310,"Though this 1963 animated musical is by no means a Disney classic, there is a lot to like. When an English king dies he leaves no successor, just a note that says whoever pulls a particular sword out of a stone is his rightful heir. After much help from a magical wizard, a young boy does just that, and becomes the legendary King Arthur. That's the plot of the first book of author T.H. White's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Once-and-Future-King/dp/0006483011/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Once and Future King</a>, which forms the basis of the story here.

The tale of a courageous child, the movie teaches the power of brains over brawn, the value of fair play and the reward of having one's worth acknowledged by one's peers. Colorful characters include the absentminded Merlin, his skeptical owl Archimedes and a wacky evil sorceress, Madam Mim.

The animation is, at times, superb. There's a thrilling encounter with the largest fish in the moat, and a delightful scene of an amorous female squirrel pursuing a mate. The movie's highlight is its climactic wizard's duel, a five-minute segment that offers some inventive visual ideas. As Merlin and evil witch Madam Mim transform themselves into everything from bunnies to fire-breathing dragons, the screen ""shakes"" with each collision and the color palette changes often. Everything is frequently interrupted by Merlin's witty references to the ""future"" 1960s, though many of these will be lost on anyone younger than say, 50.

Unfortunately, there's also a lot that falls flat. Many wonderful elements of White's story -- Merlin's magic, for example -- are treated as if they're ho-hum parts of everyday life. The opening scenes are overloaded with dialogue, the skit-style narrative has no real drive, and overall the animation is basic by Disney standards, much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jungle-Book/dp/B000OLGCI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jungle Book</a>&nbsp;(some of it, in fact, was reused in that later film).

Still, the good outweighs the bad. As someone who has to be familiar with most all of great moments the Disney studio has given us, I find ""The Sword in The Stone"" easy to pick apart, but nevertheless surprisingly entertaining. For all its flaws, the movie still has just enough Disney magic to thoroughly engross a preschooler, and entertain many others.

In other words, as one of Disney's worst animated films, ""The Sword in The Stone"" is one of the best. In fact, the new book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pixar-Touch/dp/0307265757/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pixar Touch</a>&nbsp;reports that this is the movie that caused a then-six-year-old John Lasseter, today's Pixar guru, to fall in love with animation.

The film is presented correctly, in its original ""full frame"" format. It is not letterboxed.

BONUS FEATURES

Movie-related extras include a good 8-minute featurette with the Sherman Brothers, who frankly discuss their contributions to the film (including the deleted song ""The Magic Key""); Merlin's Magical Academy, a tongue-in-cheek series of quizzes and video games; a 7-minute clip black-and-white TV clip excerpt from the ""All About Magic"" episode of ""Walt Disney Presents"" with Walt doing magic acts; a series of film facts; and galleries of concept art.

The disc also has two Disney cartoons. When Mickey Mouse tells a white lie about his fighting prowess, he ends up facing down a rampaging giant in the 1938 classic ""Brave Little Tailor.""

307310,5,6300275310,"There is a small miracle included with this DVD. For those who like good magic, the incredibly difficult to get Disneyland episode 'All About Magic' is really special. It has taken me decades to track this one down. If ever black and white television looked colourful, then this is a fine example.

Walt does an exceptional job at making the magic he handles look carefree and surprising. That wonderful Disney animation and special effects crew of that era make this magic even better. Small swirls of stars, puffs of smoke and those distinctive Disney music touches are really something. This is the way to make magic of the conjuring kind look simply marvellous.

The superb Hans Conried as the face in the magic mirror pulled out every stop in his bag of character acting tricks. The sleight-of-hand magician who provided his hands for these sequences is uncredited, but if you would like to see a master at work ... see this. The techniques shown here are surely those of a genius in the art of deft hand manipulation. It would be great to know which magician performing at the time was that good.

The magical equipment presented by Walt Disney was state-of-the-art in the early 1950s and has, arguably, never been bettered.

This lovely episode of Disneyland displays the sort of finesse the entertainment industry has lost.

307371,3,6300275310,"The Sword In The Stone is a necessity to have in every Disney lover's collection. It's simplistic, heart warming, and a real feel good movie. Many Disney movies these days are over the top, more about the celebrities doing the voices, and won't be remembered in 30 years time - Walt will be spinning in his grave.

Everyone knows the story about The Sword In The Stone. The story starts before the myth that King Arthur is dead, but is just waiting til Britain is in trouble again, before he rises. Along with Merlin, he's supposed to be buried in Scotland somewhere, but there are so many places laying claim to it, and it's just a myth. But I'd like to believe it.

We meet Arthur, an orphaned, scrawny little boy, who meets Merlin, an eccentric crackpot, with a talking owl called Archimedes, who funnily enough, can do magic. And so starts an amazing story.

There are some very memorable characters in this, particularly Archimedes, who not only has terrific sarcasm, but is hilarious. Also Merlin gets up to no good with his magic, turning Arthur into a fish, and then into a squirrel, where he gets a love interest. That's one of the sweetest moments, when the girl squirrel realises, hey there's a cute male squirrel. It's probably one of the films that I saw when I was young that I thought that's what love was supposed to feel like. Can't keep away from them, need to be with them all the time, and then get your heart broken when you discover they're actually a strange creature and not a squirrel at all.

The Madam Mim sequence is a bit silly, and frankly, doesn't have much to do with the rest of the story, so it's easily skipped past. The ending I found dull and uninteresting when I was young, and still find it the same today. It seemed wound up too fast.

The Sword In The Stone, although often skipped over when people list the Disney classics, needs to be taken more notice of, and you will be laughing so hard you have to pause the movie.",1192233600,3,1961,4.451253481894151

307376,5,6300275310,"When Disney released The Sword In The Stone onto DVD in 2001, Disney had only really gotten into releasing their movies onto DVD within the last two years, starting with their failed Limited Issue line. The Gold Collection followed, with some of the Limited Issues repackaged as Gold Collection titles, and more titles released. Most of these had decent, if not somwhat problematic DVD transfers and few, if any, bonus materials. However, a few of Disney's Gold Collection titles were given decent releases. Among those are the 30th Anniversary Edition of Bedknobs and Broomsticks (Although not officially a Gold Collection title by many people's standards, it says Gold Collection on the spine.) and this 2001 DVD release of The Sword In The Stone.

First off, the film is given a nice transfer here. The DVD case boasts that it's ''fully restored and remastered.'' Although it's not up to par with the Platinum Edition restorations or the Masterpiece Edition of Alice In Wonderland's transfer, it IS far better than many of the other Gold Collection transfers. It's nicely cleaned up, although it's a bit grainier than one would like, and there's still a bit of dirt in the transfer. The colors have been punched up nicely, though. The video transfer here is very satisfying, as is the audio mix.

The disc also includes quite a few good bonus materials. A Sword In The Stone scrapbook features concept art for the film, production photos, character design, concept poster art, official poster art, and more. Two sing-alongs lifted from Disney's Sing-Along Songs video series provide fun captions for two of the film's more memorable songs. Film Facts is...well, basically that. Two animated shorts, ''Knight For A Day'' and ''Brave Little Tailor'' are very entertaining. ''Music Magic: The Sherman Brothers'' has the Shermans talking about songs they wrote for The Sword In The Stone, including a couple that were deleted. (The Shermans also did a Music Magic featurette for Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and that one WAS better, because it also gave a little info on the making of the film, as well as its 1996 restoration.) Finally, an episode of Walt Disney's Disneyland TV series is included - ''All About Magic'' from 1957. Although this isn't directly related to The Sword In The Stone, its inclusion is to be praised nonetheless.

My only disappointment in this DVD is the lack of any sort of theatrical trailer or TV spot. Come on, Disney!

Nonetheless, The Sword In The Stone is a fine example of Disney's earliest attempts to give their movies the deluxe treatment on single-disc DVD releases, reserving their 2-Disc DVD releases for Platinum Editions (This was the year that Snow White's Platinum Edition DVD was released.) and the DVD releases of their most recent animated features. I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD for fans of the film.

EDIT: This edition has been locked up in the Disney vault as Disney is planning a 45th Anniversary Edition DVD in 2008. Based on reissues of Gold Classic Collection titles within the past few years, we can expect a freshened up cropped widescreen transfer, (Most Disney animation from 101 Dalmatians to The Fox And The Hound was designed and animated in fullscreen, but designed so that they could be cropped for widescreen theatrical exhibition.) a light handful of new bonus materials that really doesn't give much to the kids or the adults, and a cardboard slipcover. Due to the great bonus materials on this disc as compared to some of the other Gold Classic Collection titles that have gotten new DVD releases, it's also likely that some of them will reappear on the new DVD.",1174176000,2,3634,4.970394736842105

307421,5,6300275310,"I really loved TH White's (1938) book 'The sword in the stone' when I read at 12 in the 1960's. TH White's 'The once and future king' is the the combined tetrology of books based on the legendary life of King Arthur, where the original 'Sword in the Stone' book was revised and edited (somewhat badly). The Sword in the Stone is therefore the first book in the series and covers Arthur's life as a youth. For the rest of the Arthurian legend you have to read the next three or four books. That is why this Disney film only covers Arthur's boyhood, and finishes with Arthur standing by 'The sword in the stone'. For this reason the book is filled with the hope and trials of youth and is thus far more jolly than most of King Arthur's adult life (at least when viewed from an adults perspective).

This film (and the book) follow Arthur's eventual rise from being second fiddle to his older step-brother Kay, who is clearly dad's favourite - his dad, Sir Hector, even calls Arthur 'the Wart'. Not that Sir Hector isn't very fond of Arthur, it just reflects Arthur's lowly but highly protected status of being a young boy. It is therefore a coming of age story, and I think any boy from 8 up would strongly identify with the Wart. Soon into the story the magician Merlin arrives and instructs the Wart using magic to illustrate points, even transforming them both into many things from birds and fish to trees and stones. This is all followed fairly faithfully by the film (although the more mystical tree and stone sequences were sadly cut out). Living his life 'backwards' Merlin naturally has the edge on other mortals when it comes to prophesy, although 'the future' in-jokes in the film do intrude somewhat. The film is also more jocular than the satirical and witty book, ignoring it's portrayal of the grittier realism of medieval life, like the young boy who has his nose bitten off by a man similarly afflicted who he was taunting. TH White manages to merge aspects of the twentieth century seamlessly into the tale, just as Mallory's 'Morte de Arthur' originally combined the Saxon descriptions of the great warrior King Arthur with 'modern' medieval concepts like chivalry and knighthood [to create the Arthurian legend we now know]. In many respects the clearly Roman educated and Christian Arthur has been confused by the pagan Saxons with Jesus, hence 'The once and future king' aspects of the legend. Interestingly France and Germany also have ancient legends of the fighting prowess of this British warrior king (generally in which that country supplies one of his most important knights).

In the film, the battle between Merlin and the witch (Madam Mim) who the Wart encounters in the forest, is far more central to the plot, and Disney can't resist adding the odd (rather good) song sequence. The uplifting end (removing Excalibur from the stone) is naturally retained, finishing the story on a high note with the 'Wart' triumphant. So all in all, a highly recommended medieval based 'fantasy' cartoon film for pre-teen boys. If you like this film, do get the original book - it's an easy read for 10 and over.",1166832000,,3127,4.725274725274725

This movie focuses on King Arthur's undocumented childhood as Disney would have scripted it.  Absent-minded Merlin takes young Arthur, nicknamed Wart, into his tutelage.  Merlin is supposedly keeping Arthur out of trouble, but gets him into trouble instead.

One highlight of this movie is a battle between Merlin and Madame Mim.  The animated sparks fly during that battle!  Merlin also has a tendency to change Arthur into various animals so that Arthur can learn something about life.  Unfortunately, Arthur manages to get into some sort of trouble each time.

Near the end of the movie Arthur is serving as a squire to Kay.  Arthur has forgotten to bring Kay's sword to a tournament.  I wonder where Arthur, the future king of England, might find a sword?  The hint is in the title of the movie.

This movie is strictly for laughs.  The movie is a lot of fun, but the modern references are occasionally jarring.  Also, while the continuous jokes keep the movie moving along, if the movie had been a bit more serious in places it would have enhanced the movie.  In spite of my minor complaints, scenes such as the enchanted dish washer make this movie one for the entire family to watch.

307425,5,6300275310,"For folks with young children who enjoy things like magic, knights, and dragons, ""The Sword In The Stone"" is a wonderful way to introduce children to the world of King Arthur.  Based on the first book in a series of books by T.H. White on the life of Arthur, Disney's ""The Sword In the Stone"" shows children how Arthur became the eventual King of all of England.  It starts off with a brief fairy tale book intro (don't all of the classics?).  After that, we see young Arthur meet Merlin and his very intelligent owl, Archimedes.  From there, Merlin begins the training of young Arthur by turning him into a fish, a squirrel, and a bird.  The viewer also gets to see Merlin flex his magical muscle against a nasty old witch.  The actual sword in the stone and Arthur don't meet up until the end of the film, but it's more than worth the wait.

Although many may not consider this a classic that ranks with other Disney films such as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Cinderella,"" and modern classics such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King,"" ""The Sword in the Stone"" is definitely in the upper-echelon of Disney's top films.

This particular DVD offering is very nice.  It features a ""Sword"" scrapbook, interesting film facts, Sing-alongs, and ""Music Magic:  The Sherman Brothers.""  It also features a Walt Disney hosted TV special, ""All About Magic"" and two animated shorts:  Goofy in ""Knight for a Day"" and Mickey in one of my personal favorites, ""Brave Little Tailor.""

307476,4,6300275310,"Among Walt Disney's thirteen animated works, none has been put aside and forgotten as much as The Sword in the Stone, which is really a shame, knowing that this is a no less delightful Disney experience, it is different in the fact that it tells a different kind of story, it is less intriguing but it offers lots of cool scenes and some memorable characters.

The story in 1963's The Sword in the Stone revolves around education, education is the main theme and the moral is that you can't be anyone without a good education (Although in the real world we know that that isn't always the case).  When England is left to perish without a king, a marvelous miracle occurs, a sword placed deep into a stone with the words that whoever pulls it out will be king of all England.  Strong and mighty men give it a try, all failing and with time the sword is forgotten.

The people of England then decide to have a knight tournament, in which the winner will be crowned king of all England.  Wise wizard Merlin soon realizes that it takes more than strength or plain brutality to rule a country so he decides to educate a young servant boy by the name of ""Wart.""  With different tricks and the help of his wise owl Archimedes, Merlin manages to teach some of the most important lessons to the young boy.  Each of these lessons are taught in fun ways, by turning Wart and himself into different sorts of animals, he teaches about intelligence against strength, gravity and even love while at the same time, showing him about how different animals must struggle to survive.

On the other hand, the son of Wart's master, Kay is the perfect example of no brain and pure strength, Merlin realizes having someone like him as king would bring the land to destruction so he must hurry and bring up Wart before Kay wins the knight tournament and is crowned King.  In the end, Wart's hard-working brain defeat's Kay's strength and leads to be one of the greatest kings in the ""history"" of the United Kingdom.

Fun, colorful scenes, great characters and lively music make this a quite memorable Disney classic.  Every scene from beginning to end is filled with fun, including one in which Merlin himself must use the logic of his own lessons to defeat the hilariously evil Madame Mim, once again, by turning into different animals, surely one of the greatest scenes in the film. Animation quality may not be of the sharpest kind, however the animation itself is lively and realistic, characters are very expressive and move about realistically.  Backgrounds can get annoyingly ""lazy"" but are not as bad as in, say, ""101 Dalmatians.""  The movie is a little dated because of its references to the 1960's, but it is still quite fun to watch at any time, any year.  Highly recommended, being the last animated feature Walt Disney saw through completion and indeed one of their greatest and most interesting.",1123027200,5,2885,4.653543307086614
307477,5,6300275310,"If you were to put 10 people in a room and ask them what their all time favorite animated Disney movie was, odds are you'd get 10 different answers. Odds are most will say familliar classics like ""The Jungle Book"", ""Snow White"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty And The Beast"", and ""The Lion King"". I, however, would go with this superbly crafted 1962 telling of the classic story of King Arthur. With its dazzling visuals, expertise storytelling and classic songs (I used to love the song played over the opening credits), everything about this film is flawless.

Wart is a boy living with his good for nothing relatives who treat him like the dishes he is forced to wash every night. However, Wart's life is about to change when a wizard named Merlin who is training the boy for something big. ALong with his obstonant owl Archimedes, he trains Wart how to become a knight and how to do other things only someone of royal lineage would know how to do. (He also turns him into a fish). However, Metrlin is also the target of an evil witch, who challenges Merlin on a duel as they search for the sword in the stone, a sword lodged in stone that will make the person who pulls it out king of England. It's a battle of wits as Merlin nasty showdown with the witch makes for one of the best moments in any Disney movie.

The conclusion: ""The Sowrd And The Stone"" is a true Disney classic that anyone at any age will embrace. Watch it as soon as possible sinceit is a guaranteed crowd pleaser.",1122854400,3,1486,4.43956043956044

Alas, we have recently entered the horrible rut of less-than classics such as the over-acclaimed arabian adventure ""Aladdin"". So, we put together a little award show as the last step of these classic viewings.

For best movie we were tied at three classics:

-Sword in the Stone

-Aristocats

-Alice in Wonderland

When it came down to the decision: it was tough. I picked on consistant enjoyment. Although throughout the viewings ""Alice"" had captured my eye as #1, in the end it had too many dead parts and a view mediocre songs. Aristocats and Sword in the Stone was one of the toughest choices to date. Aristocats fell short only because of ONE incident of realitive deadness. The characters in Sword in the Stone are just lovely, and though the ending is very dissapointing, it prooves to be the #1 Disney Movie of All Time, in our humble opinions. Not a dead moment, a wonderful cast, timeless characters (especially Merlin and his sidekick of the late man who played Archimedes). Musical number enjoyment and overall timelessness awards this a true classic.",1122163200,2,1226,4.791469194312796
307509,5,6300275310,"Now available on DVD, this is the very same priceless Disney story we all know and love; if you've never seen it, it's never too late to enjoy this classic.  The Sword in the Stone is an adaptation of the story of King Arthur, as a boy.  Years of continuous discouragement haven't dented Arthur's noble qualities of kindness, understanding, perseverance, bravery, and responsibility and the amiable wizard Merlin takes boy Arthur under his wing to teach him the importance of knowledge (brain over brute) in a dazzling adventure through magic and miracle.  Merlin's only problem is that he perhaps knows too much, and very comically can't seem to stop tripping over himself while trying to explain things that ""won't be invented for hundreds of years!""

The quality of the DVD picture and audio is much better than any copy of this movie I'd seen previously, and the disc itself includes several other enjoyable features, such as a few popular animated Disney skits starring Goofy and Mickey Mouse, and a still art gallery containing excellent classic works of art.

I thoroughly disagree.  When I think of this film, there are nothing but fond memories of singing along with my father and naming local squirrels after Merlin and Arthur.  To this day, it still evokes fond memories and childish wonder at the intriguing adventures in wizardry, sword-play and medieval England.  It's an absolutely magical story, and an absolutely magical film.

307511,5,6300275310,"Sometime in the medieval ages, there is a legend about this magic stone that contains a sword and according to the legend, who so pulls out the sword from the anvil shall become king of all England. Though many tried to pull it, no miracle and the sword was forgotten for ages in an age of no laws, brutality and darkness in just which magician Merlin has trouble with the days of no kings, he then meets a young squire named ""Wart"" ( a.k.a. Arthur) whom is a problemic young man with a mean foster father and big foster brother, Merlin then trains Wart through education in order to become more social and on adventures that will lead him to pull the sword out of the stone.

An underrated disney classic that is a delightful story with good animation for it's time, nice songs like ""Higitus Figitus"" and humor makes this a definite must have for the animation DVD collector everywhere.

The DVD has some great extras like two cartoons, Behind the songs with a deleted song that never made it into the film, still frame galleries, All Abou the Magic 1957 episode or ""Walt Disney Presents"", Film-facts, sing-alongs and great remastering with good sound quality.",1108080000,36,1161,4.631067961165049
307512,5,6300275310,"Loosely based on the Arthurian legends, and particularly the series of books by T.H. White, ""The Sword in the Stone"" introduces us to Arthur as a scrawny, towheaded little boy, about eleven years old. There is a prophecy that whoever can pull a magical sword out of the stone in which it is embedded will be the next King of England, but young Arthur, an uneducated servant and squire to his dim-witted and brutish foster brother Kay, an aspiring knight, is a long way from fulfilling his destiny. In the meantime, he finds himself under the tutelage of Merlin the Wizard, who attempts to fill his head with the knowledge that he will need to reach his potential.

Disney has turned this legend into a comically delightful little tale, with a cast full of terrific characters. Merlin is a bit absent-minded and rather eccentric, but finds fun and innovative ways to teach young Arthur the lessons of life, including temporary transformations into a fish, a squirrel, and a bird. Also memorable is his owl, Archimedes, a stodgy little ball of feathers that you can't help but love. And the movie is not devoid of memorable villains, either, from the dull and oafish Kay, to the persistent but consistently unsuccessful wolf that stalks Arthur through the woods, to the ""magnificent, marvelous, mad"" Madame Mim, the gleefully evil witch who is Merlin's nemesis. One of my favorite sequences is the Wizards' Duel between Merlin and Mim.

I have always been a little surprised that this film isn't more well-known amongst the Disney classics. It was probably my favorite as a child, and was only bumped out of the number one spot when ""Aladdin"" made it's debut in 1992. But it still holds a very special place in my heart, and I'm thrilled to now own it on DVD, remastered and more wonderful than ever. Made in 1963, the animation has the older, sketchier ""classic"" Disney look, which I tend to prefer over the sleek new style, and the colors in this remastered version are rich and lively. The songs are all very catchy, often with delightfully humorous lyrics.

The DVD comes with an abundance of great Special Features. There is a Scrap Book with concept art and movie posters, a ""Music Magic"" featurette with the Sherman brothers that includes two songs that were never put in the movie, sing alongs of ""Higitus Figitus"" and ""That's What Makes the World Go 'Round,"" a brief but interesting section of Film Facts, a 1957 TV show ""All About Magic"" hosted by Walt Disney, and two animated shorts - ""Knight for a Day"" starring Goofy, and ""Brave Little Tailor"" starring Mickey Mouse.

Regardless, it's one of my favorite Disney movies. Yes, it is underrated. My favorite scene is when the Archmedes the Owl is laughing after Merlin's plane gets tangled in his beard and falls into the water. I also love the scene with Kay getting mopped up in the ""black magic"" dish washing scene. I can go on and on. I'm almost 30 years old now and I cherish it just as much as when I was a kid.

an insightful (and candid) interview with the composers;

Loosely based on White's ""The Once and Future King"", although ""Sword in the Stone"" does no justice to the original material, it is still a fun filled romp that children will love.
The Transformation bits are the best. The young Wart (the future King Arthur, believe it or not) is transformed into a bird, a fish, and a squirrel to teach Wart lessons that he will need to know once he becomes king. These are the highlights of the film.
Younger audiences will enjoy the dancing dishwashing sequence.
The final conflict between Merlin and Mim is almost anti-climatic. But we do get to see Wart withdraw the Sword from the Stone and become King Arthur. I rather liked the few references to modern technology that Merlin throws at an unknowing Wart. It gives him an aura of ""I know what's going to happen"" that is sorely needed by Merlin as the wizard that trains Wart.
Note that I would have given this DVD four stars if it had been presented in letterbox format (true 16X9 ratio) as well as the included pan-and-scan version.

Merlin is a riot! ""When, blasted it all, when!"" And his owl...and Wart is a good character, and how can you NOT love the scene when they're squirrels? How cool is that?

However, on further investigation, I discovered that, to my surprise, ""The Sword in the Stone"" was not a widescreen motion picture... at least not originally.  Apparently, like ""101 Dalmations"" and other films of the late 1950s and early 1960s, ""The Sword in the Stone"" was made to be projected in one of two formats: either widescreen or full-frame, depending on the theater where it was shown.  It seems that the Disney animators designed the film with a bit of 'extra picture' at the top and bottom of each frame; that way this 'extra' could be cut off without ruining the image in theaters playing it in widescreen.  In other theaters, and on television, the film could be shown in a standard full-frame (1.33:1) format.  So, according to Disney, the current full-frame DVD of ""TSITS"" is indeed the film in it's ""original format'.

307576,5,6300275310,"Critics tick me off more and more lately. It's amazing how they never fail to hate movies the public LOVES! THis is a true Disney masterpiece! Who doesn't love watching the Wizard's Duel over and over?!!!! That was sooooo cool! This digitally restored copy is gorgeous, with GREAT extras! I LOVE extras, particularly when Disney DVD's include classic shorts like this one does! It even includes a whole episode of the Disneyland TV show! Priceless!!! This is a great DVD! Get it! Get Bedknobs and Broomsticks too! I forgot to mention in my review of that one that it has more classic Disney shorts! Keep those extras comin' Disney!",984960000,4,631,4.798165137614679
307617,5,6300275310,"I remember the first time I saw this movie. I've always loved Arthurian legends, and in its usual style, Disney puts aside many historical facts in favor of a more entertaining movie, fun for the whole family. Sword in the Stone ranks up in the top 3 of my favorite Disney movies of all time. The characters are well done, Merlin is hilarious, and the artwork and colors are beautiful, making this movie great scenery for the younger kids, and great, enriching fun for the older ones.",982713600,13,484,4.574712643678161
307618,5,6300275310,"When this movie was first released I went to see it with my brother and we both loved it! It has wonderful humor, Merlin is terrific and wonderfully voiced as is Archimedes,the Owl. The animation is superb and the peripheral characters are great; my favorite being Sir Pelinore who had a problem with his enormous moustache...when Merlin travels with Wart to his castle the packing is something to see! There are many animal metamorpheses that Merlin and Wart undergo; check out the fish transformation, great stuff! I especially enjoyed the fat female squirrel who became overly enamored with Merlin. Buy it, add it to your Disney collection and enjoy!",979862400,3,653,5.0
307619,5,6300275310,"""This tale begun when England was young, and knights were brave and bold."" began the greatest attempt Disney ever made at turning classic literature into a motion picture.  Excellent songs and characters fill this Disney great.  I can't believe it doesn't get the credit is deserves.  I believe now a days Disney has lost its touch of its once glorious animated films.  Sword in the Stone will always, in my mind, be a classic of movie-making.",976838400,4,443,4.7894736842105265
307620,5,6300275310,"When I'm asked by others what my favorite Disney movie is I always mention The Sword In The Stone.  What great characters! What fun! I'm 31 and I STILL love it! Will certainly get the DVD.  Great voicework (including the ""They're Gr-r-reat!"" Tony Tiger actor).  Sometimes I think professional movie reviewers need to step back from the hired microscope of their profession and ""smell the roses"" as it were as many great titles are often unjustifiably slammed.  This Disney classic is funny, cute and entertaining...GET IT!",969494400,3,522,5.034883720930233
307621,5,6300275310,"Surprised from the reading of somewhat negative reviews of thismovie, I add my two cents of support.  I believe that this movie isone of the best, if not the best of all Disney movies. The tale of the quest and education of the young Arthur deals with many of the angles and metamorphoses of the spiritual journey, most than any other cartoon movie we have seen. My family ""cherishes"" this movie as one of the best movies, and not just considering animated ones. Unfortunately, critics and viewers are enjoying movies just for the kicks and tricks -- literally, fight scenes and the like -- and forget how little we give to kids regarding the larger spiritual fights that create real heroes.  Hope someone watches it based on our experience.",964483200,7,741,4.736434108527132
307622,5,6300275310,"The Sword in the Stone is simply the best Disney animated film of all time! It's full of wonderful and unique animation. I can't stand how cookie cutter and overdone their current stuff is. (ie. Tarzan, could his chin get  any bigger?) But the film is also full of brilliant well developed  characters. Merlin and Archimedes are great fun as they bicker like a  couple of siblings about how to teach Wart to think for himself. Wart is  great fun and even side characters like Pelinor are full of quirks.  (twitching his beard when ever he speakes) You'll understand when you see  the movie. Give this film a chance and you'll love it. Leonard Maltin is  either writing reviews from his Critics Cliff Notes or he accidently stuck  his copy of ""The Lion King II"" in the VCR, because  ""Sword.."" is great. The only reason I can think why people  wouldn't like it is because we have forgot how to appreciate subtlety. This  movie is great fun for both young and old. I'm 24 years old and I'm still  watching it!",959040000,,1006,4.497237569060774

307624,5,6300275310,"""The sword and the stone"" is a Disney classic and how can you go wrong with that.  This happens to be my favorite Disney movie and possibly my favorite movie of all time.  This movie is an excellent movie because it  not only shows the triumph of Arthur(Wart) in his rightful quest to the  crown, but is funny and magical.  I love Merlin and Archimedes. They have  to be one of Walt's most creative characters.  Also Arthur is portreyed  very well as a nieve boy in the midst of the midevil era.  Also another  great thing about ""The sword in the stone"" it's not Disney's most  publisized videos which in my opinion makes it more apealing.  For all this  I have to thank my girlfriend.  She got me the movie.",946080000,,708,4.346153846153846

My 3 1/2 year old son really likes Merlin and young Arthur. The film captivates him,  makes him laugh and he asks lots of questions about the what and why of the  plot (is there much more a film should do at this age?).
