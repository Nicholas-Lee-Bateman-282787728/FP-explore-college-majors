8651975,1,B005HZC93Y,"This is NOT an Agnes Varda film. It is Huey! by Sally Pugh and additional Black Panther Newsreel footage Off the Pig (distributed by California Newsreel). Neither are very good image quality but both are important films in their own right. One star because it is not the film it claims to be. This review is for the International Film Forum version. There is also an International Historic Films (IHF) version that also claims to be Varda's but it is also these two films. Varda's film is in color, it's 28 minutes, and it is distributed by Criterion and Cine-Tamaris Video Paris.",1460073600,6,580,4.696078431372549
8651976,1,B005HZC93Y,"It's so low quality, I just literally throw it away. This is not the Anges Vardas DVD I wanted. It contains one semi-interesting speech and then some shots of Oakland. Don't buy",1378166400,8,177,4.5625
