3087535,5,B0012EM5HO,Love it!  Hope they release all the episodes and I plan on buying all of the Uncut Boxed sets!,1234310400,,94,3.9473684210526314
3087536,5,B0012EM5HO,"This is an amazing contintuation of the saga of Naruto Uzumaki. This seventh volume is action packed, a must have for anyone who occasionally watches the show or has come down with Naruto fever. I recommend it very highly.",1214352000,3,222,4.717948717948718
3087537,5,B0012EM5HO,"If you just starting to watch Naruto and you  think it's a children's show then you are dead wrong.  When you see the first episode, you might think it's a dramatic comedy show at first but it is not.  Naruto is a good solid series and if you make it up to episode 80 then be prepare for an incredible treat.  This box set introduces the man that the character Sasuke Uchiha loathes so much.  Itachi Uchiha makes his unannounced appearance, however, Sasuke is not his biggest target.  So what is Sasuke's evil brother have in mind? Well you will just have to find out in this explosive box set.  You will see one of the greatest villain to make his debut on the series.  His eye techniques are incredible as he causes his opponents to go through a horrible hypnosis the affects them mentally.  If you're a Naruto fan then this is a must buy especially if Amazon.com has a sale from time to time.",1212969600,,895,4.343373493975903
3087538,4,B0012EM5HO,"One of the best recent anime series allowed in prime time. Concludes the Chunin exams story arc (except for the first episode or two of the next set). Only down side is that these sets are only 3 disc half-seasons rather than full seasons, especially considering the price. That's the only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5.",1212796800,,323,4.491525423728813

3087540,5,B0012EM5HO,"Let me begin by saying what a fan I am of this series.  I am 40 years old and am proud to admit that Naruto is one of my favorite, if not absolute favorite anime.  The series is able to meld comedy, action and drama in a nice shiney package without going overboard in any direction.  The character development is excellent as is story.
I would highly suggest this anime to anyone.  Start with box set one and enjoy!",1210636800,,415,4.215189873417722
3087541,5,B0012EM5HO,"This was another great naruto series, know sasuka's brother appears itachi uchia, they hate eachother so much that sasuka wanted kill him but sasuka is no match for his brother. MightGuy appeared to fight kisame there was a draw both evenly matched, the third hokage thought he finished of orichmaru but no he came back for more damage and destruction, the third hokage was no match for orichmaru so he sealed orichmaru's arm's so he won't use his jutsu, the third hokage died but with a trick up his sleeves by sealing his arm's. Okay this was a great series, volume8 comes out june10 08 can't wait till that comes but was a great series.",1207872000,,639,4.565217391304348
3087542,4,B0012EM5HO,"I have all the box sets so far (30.00) and the last one was the cheapest. Now I know that anime sometimes tends to drag on, and that is what the hokage and orochimaru does.
But this one is like 37.00. I It only has 12 episodes tat is not officially half a season it usualy takes two box sets of 13 for that.
I know I am stingy but really.
I think they only have so many episodes because they have to have the japanese version to.",1203206400,2,429,3.8863636363636362
3087543,5,B0012EM5HO,"I'm a big fan of the Naruto series. This will be one of the better sets in the series, because it has a lot of action. Starts off with Saske(not sure on spelling) fights gara. Then it goes into the attack on the leaf village. Its a set you will want to own.",1202947200,2,257,3.8679245283018866
3087544,5,B0012EM5HO,"Note:  If you're new to Naruto, go get the other boxed sets and watch them first.  These are a bit better than the episodes we get on cartoon network because CN cuts a little bit of stuff.  I don't find the DVDs to be any more graphic than the televised episodes.

OK, after too many months I've editing this review to correct the episode list.  Regardless, they appear to cover the very end of Naruto's fight with Gara and then proceed past Tsunade powning Naruto in the street after they first meet, and up to, but not through, the battle with orochimaru.

3087633,3,B0012EM5HO,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 7 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes seventy-nine through ninety-two of Naruto.  The first disc contains four episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  The focus of this box set is on the death of the Third Hokage, the battle between Sasuke and Itachi, and Jiraiya and Naruto's search for Tsunade.

The first extra is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of ten pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 8, which runs for roughly four minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode eighty-five.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

A link in the extras menu labeled as ""Trailers"" takes you to four trailers.  The first is a trailer for the Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution videogame.  However, this trailer feels more like a ""how to"" tutorial for playing the game instead of an actual advertisement; also, the audio is mastered very low on this clip, so it's really hard to hear it unless you turn the volume way up.  There are also trailers for Bleach, The Prince of Tennis, and Death Note included.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled as ""Manga.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, an advertisement for the Naruto manga, and a couple of advertisements for other Shonen Jump manga titles.  The final selection in the menu is labeled as ""Sneak Peek""; it turns out that this selection takes you to a trailer promoting Viz Media's release of the Buso Renkin anime series.

I'm still rather disappointed in the lack of special features on this set, even though I've come to expect it.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 7 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1269907200,,2145,4.62962962962963

I would highly suggest this anime to anyone.  Start with box set one and enjoy!",1210636800,,415,4.215189873417722
3322038,5,B0012EM5HO,"This was another great naruto series, know sasuka's brother appears itachi uchia, they hate eachother so much that sasuka wanted kill him but sasuka is no match for his brother. MightGuy appeared to fight kisame there was a draw both evenly matched, the third hokage thought he finished of orichmaru but no he came back for more damage and destruction, the third hokage was no match for orichmaru so he sealed orichmaru's arm's so he won't use his jutsu, the third hokage died but with a trick up his sleeves by sealing his arm's. Okay this was a great series, volume8 comes out june10 08 can't wait till that comes but was a great series.",1207872000,,639,4.565217391304348
3322039,4,B0012EM5HO,"I have all the box sets so far (30.00) and the last one was the cheapest. Now I know that anime sometimes tends to drag on, and that is what the hokage and orochimaru does.
But this one is like 37.00. I It only has 12 episodes tat is not officially half a season it usualy takes two box sets of 13 for that.
I know I am stingy but really.
I think they only have so many episodes because they have to have the japanese version to.",1203206400,2,429,3.8863636363636362
3322040,5,B0012EM5HO,"I'm a big fan of the Naruto series. This will be one of the better sets in the series, because it has a lot of action. Starts off with Saske(not sure on spelling) fights gara. Then it goes into the attack on the leaf village. Its a set you will want to own.",1202947200,2,257,3.8679245283018866
3322041,5,B0012EM5HO,"Note:  If you're new to Naruto, go get the other boxed sets and watch them first.  These are a bit better than the episodes we get on cartoon network because CN cuts a little bit of stuff.  I don't find the DVDs to be any more graphic than the televised episodes.

OK, after too many months I've editing this review to correct the episode list.  Regardless, they appear to cover the very end of Naruto's fight with Gara and then proceed past Tsunade powning Naruto in the street after they first meet, and up to, but not through, the battle with orochimaru.

3322130,3,B0012EM5HO,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 7 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes seventy-nine through ninety-two of Naruto.  The first disc contains four episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  The focus of this box set is on the death of the Third Hokage, the battle between Sasuke and Itachi, and Jiraiya and Naruto's search for Tsunade.

The first extra is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of ten pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 8, which runs for roughly four minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode eighty-five.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

A link in the extras menu labeled as ""Trailers"" takes you to four trailers.  The first is a trailer for the Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution videogame.  However, this trailer feels more like a ""how to"" tutorial for playing the game instead of an actual advertisement; also, the audio is mastered very low on this clip, so it's really hard to hear it unless you turn the volume way up.  There are also trailers for Bleach, The Prince of Tennis, and Death Note included.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled as ""Manga.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, an advertisement for the Naruto manga, and a couple of advertisements for other Shonen Jump manga titles.  The final selection in the menu is labeled as ""Sneak Peek""; it turns out that this selection takes you to a trailer promoting Viz Media's release of the Buso Renkin anime series.

I'm still rather disappointed in the lack of special features on this set, even though I've come to expect it.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 7 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1269907200,,2145,4.62962962962963

Everything was going well, (some annoying parts here and there), but it was entertaining and it intrigued us enough to keep watching. Then the unthinkable happened: new music. In tense or active scenes terrible flute music would suddenly appear. There are a lot of annoying things in Naruto but this just took the cake for me. I love music and it influences my ability to enjoy and better experience whatever I am watching. It has gotten to the point where I have started muting the action scenes.
