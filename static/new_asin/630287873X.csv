The best thing with the movie is the ending battle, where the cops finally meet som criminals that match up with their qualities.  Still pretty poor piece of film.",957571200,2,256,4.446808510638298

one of the greatest movies. non-stop action. the funny the characters. not to mention the actors. I don't like the dvd price.

<MY REVIEW>

Yes; a great movie -- however, the fact remains that if you desire to obtain the entire series on DVD, you ""have to pay through the nose"" for this installment.",1400889600,,341,4.573770491803279

524220,2,630287873X,"Police Academy 6 - City Under Siege~ Bubba Smith is not as good as the first movie. Still it is not any worst then 3, 4 or 5 and I grade it 2 stars. The script could have been written by 100 monkeys at 100 typewriters. The movie is filled as usual with steero typical roles. Some of the jokes like the guy with the sound effects is like old and many others have been like recycled so many times that even the script writers must have known this. Then again it is a police academy movie so to expect a well written script is like asking to much. The acting is terrible and even worst then the previous movies since Guttenberg and Goldwaith are missing and their wit and smarts could like save many situations. The music is some of the worst 80's music I have ever heard and even when this movie was made I must have been hard pressed to identify them. Still you will not get grade A artists coming flocking to a 6th sequell of a movie. If you like Police Academy movies then this will be barely ok, otherwise avoid this pseudo turkey of a movie. Yeah it is not a total bomb, but I can only give it 2 stars.",1150070400,,1105,4.096774193548387

Also returning is: Lance Kinsey, Matt McCoy, Arthur Batanides.

Harris now works at the Wilson Heights Division.  There has been a crime wave going on and Harris needs some help.  Surprise!  Harris gets a new partner, Cmndt. Lassard.

524232,5,630287873X,"Yes,Commandant Eric Lassard(George Gaynes) is still here. He was supposed to retire after the end of the previous sequel due to age limits. Commissioner Henry Hurst(George R. Robertson) announced in the last scene that Eric continue being the MPA's commandant until he personally decides to retire. That brought relief and happiness to Eric's colleagues,except Captain Harris(G.W. Bailey) and Lieutenant Proctor(Lance Kinsey),of course. In the sixth film of this Police Academy series,it opens with Harris and Proctor on a stakeout one Sunday morning in civilian attire. They missed the Wilson Heights gang striking. They didn't know until another cop from another precinct told them. It turns out that the mastermind of the gang is the city mayor(Kenneth Mars). Matt McCoy returns as Eric's nephew Nick,now an MPA member. Douglas Fackler(Bruce Mahler) returns after being written out of the previous two sequels. We even see Nick and Doug meeting,exchanging handshakes. The mayor's hobby is collecting model ships,which he built himself. Harris complimented the mayor's fabulous collection,but he accidentally destroyed one of the ships. One funny scene was where a dye pack exploded after Harris walked out of a bank with it. The dye discharged all over him. That almost happened to Nick,who claims he found dropped stolen money and was gonna give it to Commissioner Hurst. The Wilson Heights gang planted stolen jewelry inside Commandant Lassard's office,thus the commandant being falsely accused of the theft,and him and his team being suspended. Harris and Hurst found the stolen jewelry. The mayor,disguised as Commissioner Hurst,is taken away after the MPA learn that he masterminded the gang's crimes. The mayor had the gang set up a crime wave in an area of property that he planned to devalue and purchase. So Eric and his gang were reinstated and in the last scene,at a ceremony,Lt. Hightower(Bubba Smith) and Harris swap assigned seats and Harris ascends into the friendly skies with helium-filled latex balloons attached to the chair he's sitting in. Nick cuts the ties holding the balloons. We hear Harris exclaiming,""Oh,Proctor,Proctor,PROCTOR!!"". It's amazing that there were six Police Academy movies made and released one by one in a six-year period(1984 to 1989). It's like a long-running television series. Say goodbye to McCoy since he would not return for the seventh and most recent film.",1085443200,,2411,5.380952380952381
524233,5,630287873X,"This is the second best in the series of seven movies.  It has drop down humor, and great jokes.  One of my favorites, Douglas Fackler returns.  Another great family film and is great for a party.  The crew is all here, Larvell Jones, Moses Hightower, Hooks, Doug Fackler, Eugine Tackleberry, Debbie Calahan Nick Lassard, Thaddeus Harris, Procter, and Eric Lassard.  And finally, after a long wait, the Police Academy series is coming to dvd.  You can buy them seprate, or in a box set that I recommend you buying.  The series will be realesed on April 6.  This an ok dvd when it comes to features, it has a trailer and a making of reel.  Here are some good parts in this movie, when Jones does Terminator, when Fackler knockes a lit cigar into the fireworks box, when hightower raps and when Tackleberry's granade gets shot up into the air and lands on Harris's car.  So, mark your calender for April 6 because Police Academy is coming to dvd.

524234,4,630287873X,"This is basically the same cast line up as 1988's Police Academy 5 - Assignment: Miami Beach except Officer ""House"" Conklin isn't here and accident causing Sgt. Fackler makes his return with a bang...literally.  The rest of the classic gang (minus Mahoney, of course) are all here: Lassard, Hightower, Hooks, Callahan, Motormouth Jones, and of course Tackleberry! This is the one where they go after the 3 goofy robbers and their ""mastermind"".  I think the only people who give Police Academy 6 bad reviews just don't like these movies because this one is filled with memorable moments.  In defense of how funny the movie is and in case you forgot, here is a list of many moments of hilarity that take place in City Under Siege:
1. Tackleberry shoots the milk carton in his Dad's hand
2. Hooks yells at the uppity guy after giving him all those citations and having his car towed
3. Callahan working out!
4. Fackler knocks a lit cigar into a box of fireworks
5. Hightower slams his hand down on a table sending Tackleberry's grenade onto Capt. Harris' car
6. Hooks & Hightower rap
7. Jones does Jimi Hendrix, Bruce Lee, & the Terminator
Let's not forget those classic Harris & Proctor moments:
1.  Proctor sings Christmas songs & Harris misses the robbery
2.  Harris gets glued to his chair
3.  Harris & Proctor go undercover as window washers
4.  Harris & Proctor go undercover as armored car security
5.  Harris and the exploding dye pack
The list goes on!  What more evidence do you need?  These movies are great.  Very glad to see they're all making it to DVD finally.  A 7 pack set will be available...I highly recommend picking one up!",1075852800,,1641,4.640138408304498
524235,5,630287873X,"Police Academy 6 City Under Seige is by far the best movie of all time!!!  It totally makes Police Academy 5, which was previously my favorite movie, seem like Gigli.  Marion Ramesy preformance was outstanding as Sgt. Laverne Hooks, her best role yet.  And who could forget the classic memorable acting skills as Darryl Honriques who played the man in a hurry.  His talent showed that no other actor could pull out such an outstanding preformance.  You could tell by watching his acting skills that he was in a hurry.  No doubt about it.  And who could forget Allison Mack who played the little girl.  In past movies she played characters such as little crying child or girl with ice cream cone.  This was her major breakthru preformance as the little girl.  She has now gone onto play in movies with such roles as teen in classroom and girl with braces.  And Gerry Lack who played an unforgetable role as an old lady.  The makeup job done to transform this 56 year old woman into a 58 year old woman was supurbub.  Lots of time, money, and effort was put into perfecting this transformation.  It was said in a rumor that half of the budget of the film was part of her makeup job.  And she pulled of the role perfectly.  Most older actors have a problem of acting too young for their roles.  Like Wilfrid Brimley in Cocoon or Scatman Crothers in Twilight Zone the Movie.  But not Gerry Lack, she pulled off the role of being old perfectly.  Michael Winslow is also one of the coolest actors of all time.  Like that time in Police Acedemy 1 where he makes a siren noise and nobody has any idea it was him or that time in Police Academy 2 where he makes a different siren noise, which sounds similar to the first siren noise but has an extra ""E-rahh"" at the end instead of ""E-rahh, E-rahh"".  Don't get me started on that siren sound from Police Academy 3, that one was a classic.
I am also thinking of starting my own Police Academy fan web site where people from all over the world can send pictures of their favorite characters.  Also I will be starting a petition to have an 8th Police Academy movie made.  Yes, an 8th movie.  It will be made even if it means me directing it.  I can not wait to get this movie on DVD watch it with my surround sound.  Right now I only own this movie on Beta and VHS, so I am missing out on the DVD quality sounds of the police cars driving, the time where they shoot the guns, and Michael Winslow.  And at a price of only $12.73, you can't go wrong.  I would truthfully spend anywhere from $25-$35 for this movie.  I am such a big fan of the series that I even have the rare one and only copy of Police Academy 1 signed by Bob Guttenburg which says is the cousin of Steve Guttenburg.  I had even spent $128.13 on E-Bay to recieve this one and only copy which is sought after by many collectors.
And for those of you that think Ski Patrol or Meatball IV is the best movie of all time, you're wrong.  What are you thinking its obviouly POLICE ACADEMY 6: CITY UNDER SEIGE!!!",1073692800,,3006,4.285968028419183

Sure, Police Academy 6 doesn't have Steve Guttenburg in it but its still a good movie. G.W. Bailey gives a better performance as Captain Harris than he did in the last movie. Also, the plot is more interesting unlike the last movie. If you are a fan of the Police Academy series, you might want to include this one in your collection. In my opinion, Police Academy 6 should have ended the series. Word of caution; don't bother viewing Police Academy: Mission Moscow.",1048896000,3,567,4.40952380952381

7832355,4,630287873X,"As so the ""Police Academy"" saga continues.  A lot of people stated that the ""Police Academy"" movies started to go downhill after the Mahoney character disappeared.  Yes, Mahoney was a central part of the movies, but ""Police Academy"" movies moved along well after him.  In this one a major crime spree is gripping the city, it is up to Commandant Lassard and his gang of misfits stop the crimminals and their evil mastermind.  Bubba Smith is a riot in his scene where he raps.  It may not be Emmy materail, but will have you laughing.  George Gayes, as Commandant Lassard always is a delight to watch.  Captain Harris and his sidekick, Proctor, are still up to their familiar tricks, and they always end up falling flat on their faces, much to the audience's amusement.
