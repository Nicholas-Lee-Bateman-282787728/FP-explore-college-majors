773014,5,6304083246,"A wonderful version of Sinbad the Sailor. Great sets, costumes, and story line. Douglass Fairbanks is great in it.",1171152000,,114,5.052631578947368
773015,4,6304083246,"This film was released 80 years ago. Hollywood and the entire film industry were not even teenagers yet. Raoul Walsh was the director. He began directing in 1912, and continued to do so for over 50 years. This movie has been called,""the most lavish fantasy movie ever made."" Some have suggested that it is the forerunner of the gargantuan modern LOTR trilogy. Another wrote,

""It is the very pinnacle of silent-era spectacle."" William Cameron Menzies designed the massive sets, and he went on to redesign them for the fantastic 1940 color version of the tale.

The film was, of course, a one-man show. Douglas Fairbanks Sr., at 40 years old, was the idol of millions of young boys. At 5'10"" tall and a trim 178 pounds of rippled muscle, he was quite a specimen. He also was a gymnist and a dancer. Fairbanks gave us the first peek of a hero with a tremendous physique, and this would spawn a plethera of muscleman movies in the future, from Weismuller to Schwarzenegger.

TV Guide's review of the movie included the statement, ""His daringly beautiful florid performance is grounded less in dramatics than in dance."" He was able to run, leap, and soar through the air effortlessly, almost seeming to defy gravity without a wire; like the young Jackie Chan. But for me, Fairbanks movements were almost too stylized, melodramatic, and grandiose. It really became a dance performance. It was, at times, almost too precious, as effeminate as a preening posing ballet dancer bouncing about the stage. His strength was phenominal. He would make sudden stops, going into a crouch, and the tableau would be strong and balanced. It was not hard to see where Gene Kelly would find the infuences for his athletic dancing style. But the frozen muscled poses often lapsed into Kabuki, or even Chinese Opera.

Perhaps because I was first exposed to the 1940 color version of THE THIEF OF BAGDAD as a kid, and perhaps, sadly, because most of us are too young to remember, or have not seen many of the great silent epics--I prefer the 1940 Korda version. But viewing this Fairbanks 1924 version today, looking back over eight decades, we are sharing the first faltering steps of Cinema, and it is difficult for me to fully appreciate its fledging art design, its corny costumes and sets, and its silly special effects. It was fun to watch it, but I was never in awe of it. I felt like I was watching 12 reels of a Monogram serial looped together. Still, befitting its classic status, I would recommend viewing it.",1106265600,4,2496,4.731034482758621
773016,5,6304083246,"The Thief of Bagdad is a very nice adventure movie.  Fairbanks plays the thief, who is in love with the princess.  With the help of a genie he must infiltrate the palace and impress her more than her other suitors.  Out to stop him is a young May Wong, who wants her Chinese countryman to marry the princess.  Our hero's cunning comes into play as much as magic as he tries to win the princess.

This is a really cool special effects movie.  It has a genie, a flying carpet, lots of fake smoke and exotic costumes.  It also has a good amount of comic relief.  An accident involving bees helps the thief to get on the princess' good side near the beginning.

I saw the Kino VHS.  Picture quality was good.  Scenes were color tinted and music was matched to what was going on in the film.  Kino is a reliable company for silent films and this release does the film justice.  (The Image Entertainment release is also a safe bet.)

This is an amazing adventure movie.  If you are into adventure films, special effects and action, or silent movies then this should appeal to you.  Libraries should also consider this film.  It has popular and critical appeal.",1103068800,8,1154,4.444976076555024
773017,5,6304083246,"I haven't seen many silent films, but this must be the one of the greatest ""fantasy"" films of this period. I read it was made at an astonishing cost (for 1924, year of its release) U$ 2,5 millions!!? (It must have been filmdom's most expensive feature before the 1926 ""Ben-Hur"").

Douglas Fairbanks is in excellent shape & form, for the ""athletic"" part he has to play (at his ""acrobatic"" best-considering he was 40 years old when it was made); and embodies the hero (the thief of the title) perfectly, who is ""redeemed"" by the power of love (in the shape of a ""languid"" princess played by Julanne Johnston). The sets are just awesome & gorgeous (designed by the legendary William Cameron Menzies), plus deft direction by Raoul Walsh.

Great acting by Anna May Wong (as one of the princess' ladies in waiting) and SoJin (The Mongol Prince), who are perfect as the ""villains"" of the story.

The Kino DVD Release, brings a digital stereo orchestral new score, adapted from the original 1924 cue sheets, a great asset, plus a set of never before seen outtakes and special effects footage, excerpts of Paul Leni's ""Waxworks"" and George Mlis 1905 ""Arabian Nights""...oh...., and a filmed ""introduction"" by Orson Welles himself.

Highly recommended for silent movie buffs and movie buffs in general, the story line & the plot is very different indeed from Zoltan Korda's classic 1940 same title masterpiece. This movie stands its own ground besides that other version. I have both and love them!!!

Beware of other inferior editions!",1095120000,38,1525,4.895348837209302
773018,5,6304083246,"Douglas Fairbanks' ""The Thief of Bagdad"" is in the public domain, so it's no surprise that there are many DVD and VHS versions of this film available, from bargain basement tapes with no music taken from battered source prints, to high-quality editions with fine music and extras. (Many of the reviews given here are for different editions, so if they complain about the video transfer, missing scenes, or the musical score, keep in mind that such comments don't apply to all editions.)
The Kino ""Deluxe Edition"" is digitally mastered from a 35mm archive negative, with 19 minutes of rare outtakes and special effects footage as extras. The film is tinted throughout -- a color effect that was used on its initial release, and which adds greatly to the fantastic nature of the story and its immense sets.
The new score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra (a quintet that specializes in reviving music used during the silent film era) is based loosely on the original ""cue sheet"" for the film by James Bradford. This means that you'll be hearing some of the music recommended for the film on its first release (although the music would have been different in each theater--silent film music was left up to the music director at each movie house). The music features many ""oriental"" pieces written for the silent film theater by forgotten ""photoplay music"" composers such as Gaston Borch and Irenee Berge, as well as pieces by classical composers like Rimsky-Korsakov who explored oriental themes. A written commentary and cue list of the music used is on the DVD as an extra, and can also be found at Mont Alto's web site, [...]
A different high-quality edition from Image Entertainment features an organ score by Gaylord Carter, who was a talented theater organist, and that's also a good choice. Be wary of other editions -- it's an amazing film, and the extra money spent for a quality visual and audio treat is well worth it. The difference in run-time between the Kino and Image editions of the film is mostly explained by a different film transfer rate.",1073347200,109,2064,4.833333333333333
773019,3,6304083246,"Some one here says this DVD has a cut down version of the film. I was going to say, if you have never seen it, it's one of the Classics of the Silent era and Fairbanks. One thing I might add that will completly change the way you percieve this film... Think Gene Kelly. Don't think about Fairbanks as an Actor, think about him as a Dancer and suddenly this film becomes a whole other kind of experiance. I'd hate to see any footage missing from this Master Work of one of the Silent Eras greatest stars. If this version is indeed cut down, go look for the complete version, and one that isn't running at Sound Speed too.",1044489600,5,620,4.218487394957983
773020,1,6304083246,"This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack). You have been warned!",1031011200,94,911,4.333333333333333
773021,4,6304083246,"Wonderful film - beautiful play with different shades of colours and Fairbanks at one of his best! I think it's absolutely great that such treasures can still be obtained on video. However, I would have much preferred the version that has Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Sheherazade"" as background music. With the ""original organ music"" the film loses some of it's magic for me.",996192000,10,373,5.131147540983607
773022,5,6304083246,"The Thief of Bagdad is one of the more famous silent films. It is also one of the very best. Many people find silent films difficult. This is not surprising for they have a style all of their own. The conventions of silent acting and storytelling are unlike anything seen today. Moreover these films demand more of the viewer by way of interpretation, for the lack of dialogue creates a sort of space for the viewer's imagination to fill up. The original silent cinemagoers were used to this, but today silent cinema must be learned.
It is for this reason that The Thief of Bagdad is a wonderful introduction to silent cinema. The motto of the film is `Happiness must be earned' and this fits in well with the task facing the modern viewer. Enjoyment of the film must also be earned. With a film like The Thief of Bagdad however, this task is not arduous. Certainly it is not as hard as the tasks facing Douglas Fairbanks as he seeks to make himself worthy of his princess. This film is wonderfully enjoyable, for it has an exciting story with special effects which still look amazing. The sets are stunning and look enormous.
This would all be for nothing however, if the film were all spectacle, if we did not care about the characters. Douglas Fairbanks is a superb thief, bringing his trademark humour and athleticism to the role. Julanne Johnston is a beautiful princess hiding demurely behind her lacy veil. The film also has great villains with Sojin a particularly wicked Mongol prince out to get Johnston, while Anna May Wong schemes to aid him.
The Image DVD edition of this film is produced by David Shepard and it looks wonderful. The print is tinted in a variety of subtle colours and is clear and sharp. There is some occasional damage where the negative has decayed but this is rarely distracting. The film is accompanied by a fine organ score performed by Gaylord Carter. This music is moody and at times haunting. It fits in very well with the action. Some video editions of the Thief of Bagdad run 155 minutes while the DVD only runs 139 minutes. I suspect that this is a matter of frame speed and that the DVD runs slightly faster than the VHS.",989539200,31,2163,4.5629820051413885
773023,5,6304083246,"THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD is surely one of Douglas Fairbank's most elaborate films; it's also tremendously entertaining.  Fairbanks utilizes all of his athletic prowess as a happy-go-lucky thief who goes on a quest to prove  himself worthy of a princess (Julianne Johnston).  The highly imaginative  sets and special effects set the right note of fantasy and, in the  supporting cast, Sojin (as the wicked Mongol Prince) and Anna May Wong (as  his spy) are standouts.",946252800,5,462,5.093333333333334

773146,5,6304083246,"The Thief of Baghdad(released Mar/24)starred,among others,Douglas Fairbanks,Snitz Edwards,Charles Belcher,Julanne Johnston and Anna May Wong. This is one of the best known fantasy films in all of movie history. Fairbanks pulled out all the stops for this one and the result has to be seen to be appreciated.
The story finds FB's as a ""prince"" among thieves,eking out an existence stealing from whomever he can and sharing it with his cohort in crime Edwards. One day he decides to mount the palace walls to steal the Caliph's treasure,after absconding with a magic rope elsewhere in the city. Once inside he spies the Caliph's daughter and falls instantly in love. Back outside his partner is baffled by any lack of treasure other than the princess's slipper. They devise a scheme to kidnap the princess away from the palace.
The next day three suitors arrive to ask for the daughter's hand in marriage. FB's makes himself into a fake prince and arrives as the unwanted fourth. The princess's fortune was read and it said the first one to touch a rose tree inside the palace walls will be her forever lover. FB's is accidentally tossed into the tree off his horse and takes a rose bud to give to the princess. He douses the rose with a sleeping agent and ascends to the princess's balcony. Seeing the rose the princess now knows FB's is the one,and when FB's realizes her devotion to him he abandons the kidnap scheme. In fact he now  becomes a changed man and admits everything,including his pretense as a prince. The guards are alerted and capture him. He is taken away to be flogged. Before he can be caged with a vicious orangutan the princess uses her clout to see him safely escorted out of the palace.
The Caliph tells his daughter to select another suitor but on the advice of one of her confidants she delays by telling them that the one that  brings her the rarest item in the world will win her hand. FB's,learning of this,goes to a holy man who advises him to become a prince and tells him of great treasures in a journey that will be fraught with peril. All this must be done within seven moons.
Off they all go. The three other suitors wind up with a flying carpet,an all seeing eye and a magic apple, which cures all ills. FB's journey is indeed dangerous as he must endure extreme heat,great underwater depths,riding to the moon on a winged horse and other perils. He eventually obtains a cloak of invisibility and a small chest with a powder that can create anything. Back home to Baghdad he races.
When he arrives he finds one of the suitors has taken control of the city. He creates a magical army and lays siege to Bagdad,and frees it's citizens and the royal house. The film ends as FB's is given the princess's hand by the now grateful Caliph and the two ride over and away from Baghdad in a loving embrace.
The film comes in at around 154 minutes,but it moves along surprisingly well. The set design by famed William Cameron Menzies is to die for. They are immense and with the seemingly endless crowd scenes on the street of Bagdad the film takes on an epic dynamic. Fairbanks has all this to play in and he does so with typical Fairbanks style;with a smile on his face,effortless athleticism and an air of devil may care. The S/FX are also state of the art for 1924 and must have amazed its audiences at the time with such things as a flying carpet,flying horse,swimming deep underwater,the materialization of objects out of thin air,etc.
Technically the film is in its full screen mode and is generally a very fine print. There are of course defects because of its age,but that is to be expected. This one disc set is loaded with extra features such as some very rare outtakes,excerpts from two film Leni's Waxworks and Melie's Arabian Nights,excerpts from the original program and much more.
All in all a must have film for all interested in film history or ""silents"" in general. If I was to pick a typical Fairbanks film to show to someone who knew nothing about him,this would be the one. It is long but is worth clinging to to the last moment. There are many a great surprise along the viewing journey. Highly recommended.",1454803200,,4152,4.601889338731444

One confusing thing I am seeing is this copy lists a run time of 149 minutes as opposed to documented 155 minutes, anyone know anything about this besides the guys with 139 minute version comment? The reason I am giving 5 stars is based solely on the movie itself. I had not seen the movie in several years and caught the digitally remastered version on TCM recently which prompted me to get a copy. The sound and picture quality are fantastic compared to the old crackly copies they used to show on free tv many years ago. The best part about this movie is that it is timelessly entertaining and fantastical aided greatly by the amazing and beautiful set designs of William Cameron Menzies bringing everything to life while Fairbanks and the rest of the cast over-act just enough to keep the captions at a minimum ;)",1452902400,,983,4.52808988764045

This is a truly entertaining film - taking the story from 1001 Arabian Nights (if you've seen disney's Aladdin you will recognize a number of similar plot elements) Douglas Fairbanks is a street thief who ends up falling in love with a princess and going through all sorts of trials to become a prince worthy of her.  Anna may Wong also is gorgeous as a supporting actress playing a scheming handmaiden.  watching this over 90 year old movie from the modern perspective of an era of computerized effects and CGI is a treat:  one has to remind oneself that all the incredible stunts you see, the vast, towering sets, are really happening as you see them (and Douglas did his own stunts - with little to no safety equipment).  the fast paced stunts, Fairbank's perfect charm and incredible athleticism, and a whimsical script keep one engaged for what is a relatively long movie (2 1/2 hours) for the day.  if you are interested in fantasy, movie history, or the silent era, it is a must see.  and it is not a bad movie to introduce folks who have never seen a silent move to one of the gems of the era.",1451952000,2,1225,4.490990990990991

They came in a little way into the movie and all the boys loved it.  The actors were able to get their point across through acting well enough that the twins could even enjoy the movie without being able to read the words.

This wonderful film by Raoul Walsh, and starring Douglas Fairbanks has been properly restored by The Cohen Media Group.  The excellent transfer came from two 35mm negatives and retains the original color tints of the film.  I was a bit confused as to why the inter-titles would change color however.  The transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, as was the original film.  Frankly I was expecting the usual problems with many of these films from the silent era.  But I have no complaints.  Cohen has done a masterful job with only barely noticeable imperfections (flicker, scratches).  Obviously the film will not look as good as modern day movies, but this is about as good as I've seen for movie from this era.

While the film is silent, an enhanced musical score comes from a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track (lossless 2.0 stereo is also available).  The score comes from Carl Davis who also conducts the Philharmonia Orchestra.  He uses flourishes from Rimsky-Korsakov to supplement his own work.  It works and sounds perfect for the film, even down to the drum beats in synch with some of the film action.  There are no language options other than the English inter-titles.

Extras include an audio commentary by Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance, a series of photographs taken during the shoot and a restoration trailer.  There is also a booklet with an essay by Laura Boyes, the film curator of the North Carolina Museum of Art.

I won't go into great detail regarding the plot itself but here it is.  The fantasy is set in the caliphate of Bagdad.  A ripped and athletic Fairbanks plays Ahmed (the thief) who manages to survive by hoodwinking the wealthier citizenry.  He manages to steal a magical rope from a street magician.  With it he is able to make it into a climbable pole.  He and his associate (Snitz Edwards) devise a plan to climb the wall of the Caliph's palace and steal a large treasure.  He stumbles into the sleeping quarters of the young princess (Julanne Johnston) and is instantly smitten.  These early scenes feature the 40 year old Fairbanks jumping over rocks, blocks and other barriers.  He also is adept at climbing walls and a rope/pole.  It's pretty remarkable stuff.

The Caliph (Brandon Hurst) has decided it's now time to marry off his daughter and invites suitors to show their stuff.  Three princes show up; a Persian, an Indian and a Mongol (Sojin Kamiyama).  The Mongol sees this as an easy way to conquer Bagdad without blood being spilled.  If the princess doesn't choose him, he's prepared to take the city by force.  Ahmed decides to disguise himself as a prince and make a play for the princess himself.  The princess decides she will wed whoever ventures into the countryside and return with the most valuable gift.  She gives them 7 moons to get the gift and return.

Ahmed, until now a ""non-believer"" seeks guidance from a ""Holy Man"" (Charles Belcher).  He is sent on a dangerous mission to obtain a magical box, but he must fight a series of monsters along the way.  The Mongol has a secret weapon inside the palace in the form of slave girl (Anna May Wong), one of the princess's attendants.  She poisons the princess with some smoke and now the race is on to get back to the palace.  The Indian (Noble Johnson) is able to see the ill princess using his found crystal ball.  They use the Persian's (Mathilde Comont) found flying carpet to get there, and when they do, the Mongol's magic elixir brings the young woman back from near death.  All the while, Ahmed is racing back with the magic box riding a flying horse.

This is all pretty cool by the way.  The film is big and grand.  It has huge sets and some very convincing special effects.  Sure a piano wire is visible once and a while but I'm not sure how they did the thing with Ahmed turning into a whirling dervish.  I suspect theater goers of 1924 were stunned by the grandeur of the film and I'm sure the ladies were swooning over Fairbanks's bare chest and gymnastics.  The film does require some patience even for lovers of silent films.  It runs 2  hours but is highly enjoyable.  A great package.",1406332800,6,4152,4.646492434662998

773505,4,6304083246,"As a film buff I had long heard about Douglas Fairbanks and I wondered if he really was that great an actor until I finally watched my first ever Fairbanks film and now I know what everyone was talking about.  Before Gable there was Fairbanks and he is every bit the quintessential leading man here in this film.  First of all in an era before anabolic steroids this guy has got a really ripped bod!  I wonder how he managed it in those days aside from great genes! I mean this was before the days of Gold's Gym so whatever his exercise regime was it really worked!

Secondly his acting was very good and without the spoken word you can only marvel at what he was able to accomplish in telling a story so well just like my favorite silent actor of all time Charlie Chaplin.  While obviously not as good as modern day CGI special effects I thought the effects here were pretty decent and holds up well even when compared with what came decades later.  My biggest bugbear when it comes to silents is the use of non-original music scores as we get to hear Rimsky-Korsakov all the time but Carl Davis does a good job of adapting the piece so that it's not just a rehash of the same themes over and over.  Some of the other restored classic silents were fortunate enough to find the original scores and this would have made it perfect for me for this release.

Overall, the restored picture quality while not perfect is very good coming from an obviously well-protected master source and holds up well when compared with even newer restorations such as Kino's ""Battleship Potemkin"" and ""Metropolis"" and infinitely better when compared with the abysmal ""Les Vampires"".  The most glaring imperfection comes with some flaring on the frames after Fairbanks first escapes out of the palace walls and spends some time reflecting while leaning against the walls.  Otherwise the other imperfections are relatively minor and certainly not enough to spoil my viewing enjoyment.  The flim's length was also a little longer than I would have liked it but this is a minor annoyance for me.

Great story, great picture quality considering the age and great acting makes this an easy review for film buffs.

773506,5,6304083246,"My review is of the Cohen Films restoration of the Thief of Bagdad (Blu-Ray).

If you're well versed on this movie or at least becoming aware, I can't stress enough how badly you need this version in your collection. Back in 1986 or 1987 PBS aired this movie a long with a adapted score by Carl Davis. From the different versions I've seen of this film, they'll attach Nikolai Rimsky Korsakoff's ""Sheherazade"" to the movie and call it a day. Carl Davis meticulously fitted the music of the same score to the scenes and added pieces of original music himself. It makes the film take on an entirely different character that leads to one of the most moving finales that I can remember. The restoration of the film is nothing short of wonderful picture quality wise, and the Carl Davis score is as complimentary as people remember it. It's worth every penny, get it while it's available.",1389657600,,883,4.624203821656051

773583,5,6304083246,"...well, not quite. The way it was meant to be seen, of course, was up on a giant screen with a live orchestra performing full throttle. Then this larger than life fantasy would be transformed into a work of art. However this Cohen Group release of the Photoplay restoration is the next best thing. Just as with their recent release of D. W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE, the Cohen Group have used digital technology to come up with an astonishing looking print that is coupled with Carl Davis' classic score (arranged from various works of Rimsky-Korsakov) which has been newly recorded. The result is a marvel to behold and to listen to. As other reviewers have pointed out, this version is so captivating that after a while, you forget that you're watching a silent movie. Douglas Fairbanks is literally poetry in motion as he glides from frame to frame showing off his marvelous body with a remarkably revealing costume during the first hour of the film before becoming the action star we expect in the final hour and a half. Yes, it's a long movie (at 148 minutes it's longer than a MARVEL superhero blockbuster) but it's also jawdroppingly lavish as it was one of the most expensive films of its era and it still remains the ultimate ARABIAN NIGHTS fantasy.

Fairbanks combines several well known stories as he tells the tale of  a lowly thief who falls in love with the Caliph's daughter and then undergoes a series of trials to prove his love. ""Happiness Must Be Earned"" say the stars in the sky at the film's opening and boy does Fairbanks' character earn it. First he is severely flogged for attempting to fool the Caliph and then he embarks on a series of impossible quests that he is somehow able to accomplish. Along the way he battles a giant spider, acquires a flying horse, a magic carpet and retrieves a key from the bottom of the sea. All of this done with what were then state-of-the-art special effects that still impress today. Add those effects to the exotic costumes, cast of thousands (well, hundreds) and William Cameron Menzies' magnificent sets which have to be seen to be believed, and you have a magical, unforgettable silent film experience. THIEF is the ideal film to introduce children to silent movies as it has a sense of naivete and wonder that is childlike in the best sense of the word. Make sure, however, that you use this Cohen Group restoration as it truly does present the film the way it was meant to be seen and it is easily the very best of the several DVDs (many of them unrestored) that are currently available.",1385164800,3,2552,4.656319290465632

This is the great Douglas Fairbanks Sr.'s 1924 masterpiece. He was one of the top stars of the silent era and, along with Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford, one of the most famous celebrities in the world. Fairbanks was a unique performer who can be considered the first action hero. This fantasy film is unique among all his works. Although it was an expensive production (the special effects were cutting-edge for the time) and a critical success, the film failed to draw the kind of box-office success that Fairbanks was looking for, and he returned to making historical action pictures.

The spectacular score was done in 1984 by that genius of silent film scoring, Carl Davis. In this, he uses themes from the classical composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov to great effect, as well as his own original music. One could not possibly hope for a better accompaniment to this film.

773827,5,6304083246,"It must be pointed out that this listing is for the beautiful new restoration on this Fairbanks classic done by Cohen Film Collection.  The current reviews are for other versions.  While I am sure the other versions have their merits, I was able to see the debut of this version at the TCM Film Festival in 2012 and can say with all confidence that this is the best version of the silent THIEF available.  It is also the only version available on Blu-ray.  According to the program notes, the restoration was done in 2K using two different negatives and it has new tints.  While the TCM screening was accompanied by the always enjoyable Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, this new home video version uses the wonderful Carl Davis score, which was commissioned in the 80's as part of the Thames Silents program in the UK.  To the best of my knowledge, this score has been unavailable for decades and is really a cause for celebration.  Anyone familiar with Davis' work (THE GENERAL, NAPOLEON, INTOLERANCE) will know that he really is one of the true masters of silent film scoring and his composition for THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is exceptional.

Fairbanks practically dances his way through the film, which is appropriate given that the Ballet Russe was a big influence on his production.  William Cameron Menzies art direction and sets are astounding and it's great to be able to see them so clearly.  The restoration really does justice to his work - not to mention Anna May Wong's beauty.  Looking forward to hearing what Fairbanks scholar Jeffrey Vance has to say in the audio commentary.  The Motion Picture Academy published his definitive book on Fairbanks and he also introduced the TCM screening.  I've seen a number of behind-the-scenes stills on various silent films, so am hoping that the featurette will be as good as the restoration.",1357516800,18,1843,4.8126984126984125

773832,2,6304083246,"Years ago I saw a fully restored and tined version of this original silent classic broadcast by the BBC.  It not only had restored footage, but also a fully orchestrated score of Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov played by the London Philharmonic.  I mean, WOW.  A silent classic staring the legendary Douglas Fairbanks was given new life.  An incredibly lavish production with music to match.  My heart and soul were captured by this broadcast on the local PBS affiliate.  I saw it twice, and had I the wherewithal I would've taped the thing.  But, being the young idiot that I tended to be back then, I totally forgot, and that version of the 1924 film is now locked away somewhere in the BBC's media vaults.

Fast forward 20 some odd years later and I come across a version of the classic silent film on DVD, but that DVD has organ music.  Yes, it's Scheherazade by Romsky Korsakov, but it's not a full orchestra.  That, and the tints are a little lackluster.  I sigh.

Then, I come across Kino Video's ""Deluxe Edition"", and I regain new hope.  Yes, there's music, and not just an organ, but it's more like a chamber orchestra with maybe a dozen or so musicians.  And additionally, they're playing some music that I've never heard before, or music that sounds vaguely familiar, but music that is not Rimsky-Korsakov's classic score.  Truth be told, as per the text on the DVD cover and on the disk itself, this is the original music played with the film.  And therefore you're getting the 1924 theatrical experience, and not the more appropriate score that the BBC expertly spliced with the piece.

I sigh again.  I'm sorry folks, the music really does help make or break this classic film.  For all of its stunning visuals it does need some sound to go with it, and regrettably Kino's version just doesn't pass muster with this viewer.  If you can, seek out the BBC's rendition of this film with the full orchestration of Sheherazde.  It will delight and tantalize as we witness Douglas Fairbanks and his supporting cast romp through this fantasy.

Take a chance, but don't be surprised if you find yourself questioning the selection of music.",1305590400,3,2145,4.709677419354839
773833,4,6304083246,"One of the silent era's most lavish films, Douglas Fairbanks' ""The Thief of Bagdad"" (1924) remains an imaginative ""Arabian Nights"" fantasy with its acrobatic producer-star in fine fettle.

I had a VHS version of this film and have watched it several time with friends.  I jumped at the chance to get it again on DVD.

The film is so good that you forget that it is silent and just enjoy the story.

A note of interest the art director on this film William Cameron Menzies is the producer of the 1941 version of this film, another of the all time great fantasy films.

There is also a version made in the early 60s staring Steve Reeves that follows the original film faithfully and is worth seeing.

773920,5,6304083246,"In 1924 the Thief of Bagdad was produced for the (then) stagering cost of $2.5 million!  The range of emotions, the sense of location, the mysteries of Babalon, and the sheer magnitism of Douglas Fairbanks (a carefree pickpocket) alone makes this special. Flying carpets, dragons, winged horses and the Indian rope trick add a sureal touch with special effects that were exceptional for the era.

Fold in the music (adapted from the original 1924 cue sheets), an introduction by Orson Wells, and very rare special effects footage and it becomes an absolute masterpiece for your film collection.
