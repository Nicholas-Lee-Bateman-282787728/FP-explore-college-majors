8208819,5,B000TFFKMY,"This film is an excellent and poignant film about the Serbian nation in World War One; very little literature, film or information is readily available on this topic to the armchair historian or scholar.  This film is an excellent introduction to the front that ended WWI and fills a glaring void on the historiography of WWI. It is laced with wonderful period footage and is an excellent introduction to the Balkan Front in WWI.",1197676800,6,429,4.797297297297297
