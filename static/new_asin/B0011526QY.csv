8240473,5,B0011526QY,"Each workout is about 10 minutes. They are all different, weight training, pilates, aerobics..
From this dvd, I found the trainers I really enjoy. And I have kept this dvd, through the years.
Jennifer Kries-pilates, Jari love-lots of squats, Tammilee Webb-arms with weights
 are the ones I use the most, you can get a good workout without getting bored, or if your in a pinch for time.
The trainers choice dads really give you an idea of which trainer you will want to buy more dvd from.
well worth the money- so inexpensive!",1401926400,,525,4.645161290322581
8240474,1,B0011526QY,"I was hoping to get a better feel for the featured workouts on this DVD but unfortunately the few minutes featured doesn't do any of them much justice. As for the effectiveness of the workouts, the bits shown don't flow well together and are incomplete if done separately. I wish I could return it",1228003200,12,297,4.518518518518518
