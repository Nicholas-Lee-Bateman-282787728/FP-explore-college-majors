8074145,4,B000A3XYYQ,"A good DVD for tennis buffs.  Really about Becker, Navratilova and Sampras.  It tells their Wimbledon stories, from beginnings to ends.  It tells about their main rivalries, but the only interviews are from those 3 people.  It would be nice to have Edberg talk about Boris, to have Chris Evert talk about Martina, and to have Agassi or anyone talk about Sampras.  Bud Collins is a person that people either love or hate, but all respect his tennis knowledge, but he isn't on here either.  Hard too to omit McEnroe, but this DVD does it.  It tries to make a succession pathway from Navratilova to Hingis, but we know that didn't come about.  The Navratilova bit is maybe 20 minutes, while the Hingis bit is about 2.  Likewise, there was a great succession bit--mainly in interviews with Becker--about the King of Wimbledon going from Becker to Sampras and then to Federrer.  At the end is a short piece on Federrer, akin to that of Hingis.  Again, would like more interviews!!!",1128556800,11,976,4.682352941176471
