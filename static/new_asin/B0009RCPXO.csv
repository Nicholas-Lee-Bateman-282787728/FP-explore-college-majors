2313468,1,B0009RCPXO,"BECAUSE ONLY THEY WOULD ENJOY IT IN FULLSCREEN.I loved the original Annie movie when I was a kid but I had never seen Annie: A Royal Adventure. I seen this product at a local discount store and I was all ready to buy it,until I found out that it was in fullscreen. I have seen another double feature with these exact same movies in fullscreen released in 2005. It must have sold well because they released it again,and here it is,also in fullscreen. I love SONY double features because they are usually two separate discs that were in the solo releases. I have bought many SONY double features with adult movies that were in widescreen or in both wide and fullscreen. KIDS GROWUP AND BECOME ADULTS and some of those might enjoy to see it as it was seen in the theater(widescreen).It just doesn't stop with this SONY double feature product,I have seen another double feature of Matilda/Pippi Longstockings,and they were both in,guess what...you guessed it,fullscreen. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT SONY?

I love kids movies because they make you feel like you were a kid again. I might eventually buy these movies separately in widescreen,which is probably SONY's intention,but it probably won't be that soon.",1298592000,4,1198,4.84390243902439
2313469,1,B0009RCPXO,"I am very, very disappointed with this order.  It turned out that the item was damaged according to an email I received from Amazon.com after I placed my order, and I was never able to receive this item.  I wanted it for one of my grandchildren in time for her birthday, but never got it.  I am now looking for it in stores, with no success.  So much for wanting to use Amazon.com for this item, again, I'm totally disappointed.",1287014400,2,428,4.3125
2313470,5,B0009RCPXO,"The '80s ""Annie"" is so great.  My whole fam --ages 2, 6, and 10.... boys too-- love it.
