7429870,1,B01578E31Q,"Dreary, depressed movie people who should be having great fun, turning le Mans into a miserable drag. Sure le Mans is deadly, and dangerous and full of disappointments, but it is what it is for the people who need that. Horrible and unwatchable.",1504137600,,245,4.72093023255814

7429879,5,B01578E31Q,"Cool and knows the world knows him nothing. Samurai Song BY ROBERT PINSKY
When I had no roof I made
Audacity my roof. When I had
No supper my eyes dined.

When I had no eyes I listened.
When I had no ears I thought.
When I had no thought I waited.

When I had no father I made
Care my father. When I had
No mother I embraced order.

When I had no friend I made
Quiet my friend. When I had no
Enemy I opposed my body.

When I had no temple I made
My voice my temple. I have
No priest, my tongue is my choir.

When I have no means fortune
Is my means. When I have
Nothing, death will be my fortune.

Need is my tactic, detachment

7429882,2,B01578E31Q,"This documentary's attempt to rehabilitate the original movie and in the process elevate McQueen to the status of visionary is really a curious affair.  On one hand, McQueen appears to have been woefully above his head in terms of job requirements.  While his enthusiasm for the race is undisputed, the entire production of the original movie was horribly fragmented, disjointed, and he obviously had a blurry notion as to where to lead his team.  Acknowledging this would have perhaps made for a fascinating documentary.  After all, it is the classic story of overreaching.  On the other hand, too many of the survivors interviewed here are lining up to adulate Steve on every count -- including his womanizing, an issue that is given undue weight and sinks this picture into embarrassing back-slapping (listen to Les Sheldon on the topic:  it's cringing).  In fact, at times the pic comes across as an old-boy's club stuck in their fossilized culture and lionizing one of their dead idols, hoping some of the cred rubs off on them -- rather pathetic.  If anything, Steve's second wife, Ali MacGraw, sets a far more mature tone in her reminiscences and nearly saves the film from some of these bozos, whose praise does Steve few favors.",1491696000,2,1237,4.913461538461538
7429883,3,B01578E31Q,"Well, they left out some important events - like McQueen beating his wife up when she admitted having that affair, then beating her again the next night. It was okay, but I'm not a racing fan and I think you need to be to really enjoy.  This all seems like craziness to me.  But some of those shots of the cars on the track were fantastic.  The ""cool"" that McQueen projected on screen was certainly not the real McQueen.",1491609600,,420,4.291139240506329

7429888,5,B01578E31Q,"The 917 is in my opinion the most iconic car of all time. It's performance is matched by it's beauty and that sound... that sound is a symphony of the heavens. Sadly there will probably never be anything like it again, and the same goes for Steve McQueen. This was a great documentary about a classic film and the struggle of a man who wanted to show the world his being. I never knew how much the making of the film tore him up.",1488499200,,429,4.119047619047619

7429891,3,B01578E31Q,"If you're an auto-racing or Steve McQueen fan this will appeal to you.  The behind-the-scenes footage is fantastic to see.  The interviews are very interesting and informative as well as exceptionally well photographed.  Not too many punches are pulled. It doesn't take too much in-between-the-lines reading to discern that LeMans was a tale of hubris and vanity gone wild. At the time of its release, I was a fanatic for the more European school of auto racing.  And I'd always thought the film was a tremendous depiction of what it was like to be a driver but that it was ruined by the ""story"".  Now I know why.",1486598400,,613,4.638888888888889
7429892,3,B01578E31Q,"Liked the movie , but it certainly change my opinion of Steve McQueen as a person. His dogmatic approach at all costs clearly cost him more than the project was worth.

7429898,4,B01578E31Q,"A must see for Steve McQueen fans and fans of early 70's racing.  The backstory in this doc about the shooting of the film Le Mans has more drama than the film itself.  Lots of present day interviews with his family, and the principals involved in the film, add weight to the story and insight into McQueen himself. Great to see more footage of McQueen at the top of his game.  Also the audio interview clips with him near the end of his life were revealing.",1486166400,,458,4.3023255813953485

7429900,3,B01578E31Q,I'm not sure why this merited documentary material. It was kind of boring. These guys decided to film thousands of hours of racing film with no idea as to a story. It's only remarkable that anyone thought this would be a good idea.,1486166400,,231,4.395348837209302

However, the movie ""LeMans"" has had the opportunity to find a larger audience over time, and the documentary frames the history of how Mr. McQueen's passion for motor racing and the belief that any film set in motion starring McQueen would make money led to bad feelings. As those who enjoy the film know, ""LeMans"" remains as a kind of super documentary about a particular race at a particular time with spectacular visual and audio. This film, like the feature film it is about, is an important document for those interested in Steve McQueen and motor racing.

As for the film not having direction or a script. @200mph you yout tend to make it up as you go along. And in the end they had a movie. You get the feeling that the people are real and sensing that speed and power as it passes by. A good discription for Steve McQueen. You get to understand that Steve didn't compromise well. He was used to hearing ""yes"". But in racing and evedently in film you don't always get ""it"" to go the way you want it to. I guess that's why he raced. You never know.

Ultimately it told the tale (*slowly*) of a self-indulgent individual whose various passions created a swath of destruction in his personal and professional life during the filming of Le Mans.  Wouldn't particularly recommend unless you like racing or the movie Le Mans.  Most interesting to me were the interviews with the drivers and the epilogue cards.

Produced in part through Chad McQueen's auto racing company, this could have been a simple by-the-numbers celebrity puff piece that complimented Actor Steve McQueen. Instead, we get a breezy, detailed, sometimes-somber but extremely well produced historical document on the production of Steve McQueen's 'Dream Project' -- a personal document about the power and exhilaration of auto racing., Problem was, Steve McQueen was NOT a director, nor did he have a script or solid outline from which to construct a cohesive film. So much like Coppola's 'Hearts of Darkness' documentary, we get a gripping account -- warts-and-all, showing Steve McQueen's struggle to complete a film while burning up hundreds-of-thousand of feet of film, as drivers are injured, and weeks dragged into months, putting them massively over budget.

7430041,5,B01578E31Q,"Very interesting to hear the man himself talk about his passion for racing, then to see what it lead him too. I think he was so in awe of the professional drivers he hired, he simply wanted to spend time with them. To compound this he unknowingly made this movie at one of the great pinnicles of Le Mans racing, with cars like Porsche 917 and Ferrari 512, and between the drivers, and those cars he almost lost his way in making this movie. In spite of having no script, no story, no plan to put across what he felt about racing, and loosing his director, what finally came out of this whole debackle was, IMHO the greatest film about racing ever made. McQeen paid a dear price for this, he lost his fortune, his wife, his production company, his reputation as a leading man, and perhaps worst of all his passion for racing. Happily years later he discovered another passion, flying, but he was much better driver than pilot. This film is remembered for its fabulous photography and one line in the script: ""Racing is life, everything else, before or after, is simply waiting.""",1482278400,,1077,4.528205128205128

7430058,5,B01578E31Q,"I had seen another documentary on the making of Le Mans which contained a lot of the same information. It possibly came with the DVD? I had been into racing a few years before the movie and saw the first race of the Porsche 917 and Ferrari 512 at the 1970 Daytona 24 race and never lost my love for those cars. In those days it was fairly easy to sneak into the pit area and get up close to the cars and pit crews. For me this movie was as much about the cars as it was about Steve McQueen's trials in getting the movie made. It brings back my memories of that time and I feel it gives a great perspective of what it was like, especially the beginning as the track is ""waking up"" and comes alive on the day of the race, no talking just preparations of race cars, the traffic, the fans, exactly as it still happens today. This is not the traditional entertainment movie as anyone who follows racing at the track, not just on TV, will identify. Endurance racing is something you live through and not something you did and is quickly forgotten like so many football games. You remember every race and this movie tells the story very well.",1481932800,,1135,4.235023041474655

A man from humble beginnings becomes wildly successful and has the opportunity to make a feature film the way HE wants it. But authority gives free rein to his weaknesses, and the project falters, leaving broken friendships and a broken marriage in its wake. Finally the studio steps in and takes over, and our hero's vision -which he himself could not quite express- is instead hammered into something resembling a marketable narrative. Our hero retains his star status but is a changed man.

7430087,5,B01578E31Q,"Being a race fan and car nut, and having grown up in that era, I can honestly say that this documentary nailed it. Steve McQueen was a hero to young boys in the 60's. By 1969-70, I was already out of high school and into college, and while the adolescent charm of racing and cars was gone within me, I have always held that era as a particular time when racing was more than just a ""gentlemen's"" sport, but a form of achieving a higher level of being. Only later did it turn into an amazing money-maker for many pro drivers.

With LeMans as a film, I can imagine one gets the true sense of what it takes to drive so bloody fast on a course where the trees and barriers and so many other cars at slower speeds, can be no more than a millisecond's worth of mistake to end a life or two or more.

I once came very close to driving in the SCCA, and while that never materialized I can understand the draw, the yearning, the attraction to the sport. Speed in a car is a frightening experience if one thinks too hard about it. You have to go out and overcome those fears or you shouldn't race. Those who go out and race without fear or concern for their lives are either doing so in a trance or do so in an incredibly dangerous and irresponsible  fashion. Quick reflexes and knowing what to do at the precise time are necessary. Stamina is also a prerequisite.

I see the film today as a true, almost pure example of the sport at its peak of the romantic years. The Porsche 908 ands 917 cars are legendary for their speed and ability to astonish the driver. The Porsche Gulf cars were some of the most fantastically and minutely prepared race cars to ever grace LeMans.

I see Steve McQueen as an iconic figure who was a victim of his own desire, since he died of lung cancer from exposure to asbestos from the driving suits of the 1960's. Not every driver succumbed to that horrid disease, but he did. One has to wonder what he would have done in his life if he had not contracted that cancer. While that is always something everyone thinks about when someone dies, it is especially significant for someone such as Steve McQueen, who was a super star of the film world as well as a superb driver.

My best wishes to his family for having the courage to produce this documentary with such resolute honesty. It is quite a tribute.",1481587200,7,2323,4.280182232346242

And although Steve McQueen was a hard-working, hard smoking/drinking/womanizing man and a driven super superstar during his lifetime, the film does not exploit those facts nor make moral judgements.

7430107,3,B01578E31Q,"An extensive--and occasionally touching--documentary on Steve McQueen's filming of the movie Le Mans. The end product, emphasizing McQueen's obsession with both racing and the film itself, is not particularly complimentary to McQueen's character. After an accident which he caused by driving too fast in the rain despite the protests of his two passengers (one of them his future second wife), he tried to steal a car from a nearby farmhouse rather than to call an ambulance, so as to avoid the publicity. He had his future wife promise to never mention that accident to anyone. When one of his close collaborators, racer Dave Piper, lost a leg below the knee during a filming in Le Mans, he never bothered to see him ever again. Instead, he wrote a letter asking that the film proceeds go to Piper (which they didn't, and McQueen never pressed the point.) Despite advice all around (including famous director Sturgis), McQueen's insistence on producing the perfect racing pictures meant that no script was written for months, with Sturgis one of the casualties. All in all, the documentary made me respect McQueen a lot less as a human being. He was fearless in the race track but a coward in his everyday life.",1480982400,3,1212,4.888349514563107

The whole thing was wonderfully filmed, very moving and, being a race fan, very informative.

7430154,1,B01578E31Q,"I love the movie Le Mans. I've watched it many , many times. 'Steve McQueen, The Man and Le Mans' , about the making of a great movie by an unpleasant man is not Le Mans and is dreadful.
Chad McQueen, who makes his living as professional 'son of' is behind this lame doc. It features far too much of him, his 83 year old 'still doing cabaret!' Mom and , of course. his Dad. His Mom, dumped by Steve some 40 years ago, is still milking it. She calls he ex "" a nice guy."" From all accounts and in this documentary, he is clearly anything but. Son Chad is a profane blowhard and seems to think as the son of 'The King Of Cool', he is  somehow 'The Prince of Cool.' He isn't and there is far too much of him and his Mom and not nearly enough of the cars and drivers from his father's great racing film.",1459728000,3,798,3.9565217391304346

7430169,5,B01578E31Q,"Striking, Moving ,Honest and in my opinion by no means not a puff piece . But to fully clarify, some thoughts on Lemans which is the subject of this movie. For me the original movie was one that had to be viewed many times to fully understand the sublime profoundness it portrays to some of us. We live in a time where most of us demand and get information and entertainment  instantly ,We don't need to think a whole lot. Lemans is not just a racing movie but one that forces the viewer to think and understand the nuances and meanings of what is happening in a drama filled life and death sporting event but also life and relationships . All this with very little dialog is hard to achieve .  It may not be everyone's cup of tea especially if you are expecting a modern movie. McQueen was dedicated to authenticity and he had the control to do it his way with Bullitt and Lemans. And yes it was misunderstood by some, For me This movie is a documentary which provides a realistic view of the making of the original movie (Lemans) with interviews and footage that for many fans are very entertaining and may provide closure. It is intertwined with a moving soundtrack and some impressive scenery . I think Mcqueen would have been proud.",1455926400,26,1237,4.4449339207048455

7430174,3,B01578E31Q,"One of my favorite movies of all time is the original movie 'LeMans' starring Steve McQueen.  This DVD is about the making of the movie.  If you are expecting the same quality as the original, you will be a little disappointed.  This video is not well done.
There are some segments where the volume drops and you will find viewers leaning forward to try to catch the dialogue.
The track footage goes back-and-forth from vintage scenes to modern.  I am versed in watching racing, but had to constantly explain to my non race fan viewers about the back-and-forth changes.
The DVD contains some background scenes during the original taping, but could have had a lot more.  It was informative seeing Chad McQueen and hearing some of his comments; although, there was no need for his occasional swearing-it added nothing.
This documentary missed the mark.",1455494400,2,850,4.875
7430175,5,B01578E31Q,"""Le Mans"" is by far the greatest racing film of all time. I don't believe a movie or documentary will ever again be made that can capture the essence of racing as understood by drivers the way that ""Le Mans"" did. McQueen's passion for the sport, the freedom of speed, and the beauty of cinematography resulted in a work that will only grow more appreciated and popular with each year. What he and his wife had to go through in its production is heartbreaking, and not far removed from the tragedies that overshadowed auto racing during that era. Only Steve McQueen could have pulled off such a masterpiece. ""The Man & Le Mans"" is an honest revelation of the true cost of magnificent art.",1455408000,29,687,4.548387096774194

This documentary interviews McQueens wife at the time and his son, as well as interviews the remaining actors and professional drivers who drove the cars for the movie.  Wonderful to see them now and hear their stories about making the movie and about Steve McQueen. There are action scenes throughout the documentary, contrary to what one reviewer stated.  1970 and 1971 were the golden era for LeMans and the only years for the Porsche 917 and Ferrari 512.  Derek Bell, near the end of the documentary, says it best when he mentions that, in 1971, the film making didn't seem to have much plot or reason, but all these years later, he now sees that it truly is a wonderful semi-documentary that captured that era, and in a way, at the time, far advanced of what was thought capable.

The background it gives to the making of the film by a man who was coming under extreme pressure because of his compulsion to make the film makes compulsive viewing. The interviews with the remaining drivers, especially David Piper who was so nearly killed in a crash that was caused by having to film multiple scenarios because there wasn't a script and his reaction to reading the letter by McQueen recommending that the takings from the opening be donated to Piper is moving.

8732899,3,B01578E31Q,"A good documentary about Steve McQueen and his passion for racing and the making Le Mans, a lot of contextual history and personal demons of McQueen's were provided to build a better connection with the man himself. I've always been a huge fan of McQueen, and very much enjoyed getting this look at who he was and what drove him during that time.

That being said, I do think the documentary would have greatly benefited from a narrator, as well as having around 20-30 minutes of quiet-not-original-footage scenes cut out. Which is unfortunate, the documentary had so much original footage from the filming of Le Mans to show, which were truly great shots, but for whatever reason the film chose to also include far too many superfluous transition shots that were presented for far too long each time, and basically only for dramatic effect. Less would have proven to be much more in this documentary.",1513296000,2,901,4.812903225806451
