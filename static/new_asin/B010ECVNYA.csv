8722216,5,B010ECVNYA,"We love the ""Museum"" movies, and to get all three together is fun for the whole family.  Unfortunately, Hollywood movies have to force curse words and some embarrassing slapstick (groin kicks) into an otherwise harmless, fun movie - and these movies follow that formula.  So parents and grandparents should view first to make sure you want to show your kids.  We show our over-12 kids with suitable discussion first of the language.  Too bad, because the plots and acting are so wonderful!",1460505600,4,489,4.926829268292683
8722217,1,B010ECVNYA,"Huge Waste of Money!  Buying this set is basically double the cost with essentially no added convenience.  At the time of writing this review I was able to buy Night at the Museum for $12, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb for $8, and Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian for $10.  This set costs an absurd $70 dollars.",1454544000,,335,4.285714285714286
