Nor can every film push the limits of film-making, simply because of a lack of talent and audience. But I'll be darned if Aurora wasn't the most revolutionary film I've seen yet, and engaging to boot. Definitely for fans of amoral, open-ended cinema like Funny Games.

Luckily, the unique structure of this film means that one can discuss all but the last scene without spoiling anything at all, although, having watched the movie just once, a year ago, I can't remember everything in great detail. For starters, the direction is very dry. The camera moves very little if at all, even on the most awkward and miserable scenes, nor is the editing dynamic and the acting vivacious, and there is no music buttering the viewer for three hours of mental sodomy.

The director writes, directs and stars, and his wife produces, a dangerously incestuous mire for such a bold film. The anti-Allen Cristi Puiu plays the main character, nameless until the end, who begins his morning with his lover, sister? before performing all of the errands he has to run around town, namely: collecting a debt, purchasing a gun, stalking his prey, renovating an apartment he might be moving into, or moving out of, murdering his victims, rejecting his meds, planning his suicide, confessing to the police, etc. All of this without betraying names, motives, or consequences, what happened before or what will happen after.

Aurora is a reverse murder mystery where you can see very plainly who has killed who and how it was accomplished. But who are they? Why are they being murdered? Until the ironically (in)explicative revelations at the end, nothing exists in the film except what happened in it. You are given no clues to mysterious questions that arise out of Puiu's very toxic but rational altercations with everyone, or private scenes of criminal voyeurism on behalf of the director, perpetrated on himself, such as an unforgettable (unbleachable) shower scene where Puiu feels himself for a hernia or tumor. This is, of course, never explained. The reversal in what to expect from a mystery, and the precise direction and performances that triumphantly carries the thesis makes this a challenging masterpiece that, while not very popular now, will probably be quoted from extensively by future film buffs and academics, as a prime example of narrative technique and coldness in contemporary cinema. Do yourself the favor.",1374105600,3,2496,5.009638554216868
8486253,1,B005TJ8GJ4,"Although this subtitled Romanian film is 3-hours long, it takes cinematic minimalism to the extreme. In fact, endless viewing time is expended on an outwardly dull individual who spends his days skulking, driving and engaging in the day-to-day drudgery of everyday life--with a marked paucity of dialogue or action.  While some abnormal behaviors do eventually emerge, they don't really create enough excitement to make this understated film worth watching.",1373846400,,457,5.6231884057971016
8486254,4,B005TJ8GJ4,"After having watched, what I considered, long-winded, never-ending three hour films like ""The Lord of the Ring"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", ""The Constant Gardener"" and ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", I promised myself I'd never watch movies this long again (although I did like Titanic, even though I'm not a fan of historical, romantic fiction). However, I decided to risk it one more time with this Romanian, three hour long film.

As usual in some Eastern European and Scandinavian films, Aurora features a lot of scenes with little or no dialogue at all and long winded scenes about every day life that don't add much to the plot. However, for some reason, I spent the entire film interested and intrigued by trying to figure out what it was about. The lack of musical score also added up to the feeling of angst and uncertainty. Roughly every half an hour, something happened and caught my  attention and kept me wondering until the very end.

Neverthless, my problem with this bleak film is its ending. I wish it had been more shocking and not so ""now let's explain what this is all about."" This is a film that either you love it or detest it, and while I'm one of those who loved it, I am a bit disappointed for the unimaginative ending.",1345248000,3,1259,4.611607142857143
8486255,5,B005TJ8GJ4,"This is an intelligent, thought-provoking movie. I kept guessing what would happen next and had to focus on all small details. The film was a high-class detective story and I did not even realize I had been in the cinema for three hours. I'll check his other film for sure.",1344902400,2,273,4.48
8486256,5,B005TJ8GJ4,"I first saw this film during a festival of romanian films, in  Stockholm. This one really made me see that there is a new wave of great cinems coming from Romania, and to me, Aurora is the best example of what is happening in Romania, as far as the developement as cinema is concerned. I was completely haunted, watching this film at the movies, not really understanding where this story would leave me, and meanwhile feeling as if I was really getting a feeling what it is to be living in this part of the world, and in the city of Bukarest. The story is so moving, and deeply disturbing, AND quite entertainig, as it takes you on its quite unexpected journey, of which I will tell NOTHING - go find out! You won't regret a single moment of taking part of this heartbreaking story, I assure you!",1344902400,5,796,4.378378378378378
