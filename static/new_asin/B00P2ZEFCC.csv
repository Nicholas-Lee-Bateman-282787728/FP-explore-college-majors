6787454,5,B00P2ZEFCC,"JACK ELAM COMES TO PLAY WITH WILL HUTCHINS IN SUGARFOOTS LAST HURRAH!

Since this column has become much more mammoth than Id ever intended when I started, I might as well include a few facts about the 4th and last season of Sugarfoot.

I have no idea how Warners came up the idea of the teaming Jack Elam as an ornery, yet ultimately pain-in-the-ass loveable side-kick for amiable Tom.

Nothing on this unlikely duo has ever been covered in interviews over the year as far as I know.

Will Hutchins and Jack Elam.  The Western odd couple.

that covers every episode of Season 3 and the Elam episodes of Season 4.

6787456,5,B00P2ZEFCC,100% satisfied,1433203200,,14,6.5
6787457,5,B00P2ZEFCC,"Sugarfoot came along just after warners other t,v, western Maverick  in 1957. 2 years after Cheyenne lead the way.  Bronco and Lawman would follow a year later in 1958.  Unfortunately another warner  western  Colt 45  was cancelled in '61. The first to bite the dust.
Sugarfoot was always deemed to be the gentlest hero of all the others but don't be fooled by Tom Brewster. he could hold his own in any situation. And Will Hutchins  certainly held his own among the other brawny heroes.  Sugarfoot  was a success on both sides of the atlantic.  In England  you couldn't turn on your t,v, at this time without a Warner Bros. t,v, show being on  especially the westerns. Sugarfoot. alas was cancelled half way through series 4.  WHY?  ask Warners  they should know.  but it wasn.t on any say so of the viewing  western public.  We loved it.  So enjoy the last 9 episodes  of a classic series..  One thing more when a season is only 9 episodes long  surely they could have put some Will Hutchins interviews on the discs as extras  Oh  well  thanks Warners please keep  em coming.  Looking forward to LAWMAN",1430524800,3,1104,4.556701030927835
6787458,5,B00P2ZEFCC,Sugarfoot ran for four seasons with this being the last entry to the series. Will Hutchins as Tom Brewster was a good fit.  As part of your library this is a good one to own.  Irecommend this as an addition to your library.,1430092800,3,223,4.162790697674419

6787461,5,B00P2ZEFCC,"That was Tom Brewster's drink of choice when he walked into a saloon. With a sweet tooth like that no wonder he was called Sugarfoot. The term Sugarfoot actually implies a notch below a Tenderfoot in the west. Played by Will Hutchins, ""Sugarfoot"" was Warner Bros. TV companion western to ""Maverick"". Another Series ""Bronco"" would appear a year later and all three series would alternate each week with each other. Like Maverick this western had a lead character who was very reluctant to play the hero but always got caught up in precarious situations.
All four seasons are now out on DVD. Gust stars throughout the series included stars like,Pernell Roberts (before his days on ""Bonanza"" and without his hairpiece that he would wear on that show) Dan Blocker,Charles Bronson,Efrem Zimbalist, Jr and Adam West, to name a few. Even James Garner shows up in Season one playing his character of Bret Maverick in a cameo appearance.
Tom Brewster is a man who roams the west carrying a book of law with him because he is studying to become  a lawyer. At first I did not know if I liked this series. But after a few episodes I began to like the character. The stories were always good. A worthy series to any western fans TV collection.",1420675200,5,1230,4.668202764976958

6787463,5,B00P2ZEFCC,"I enjoy Will Hutchins and the Sugarfoot series.  The character is different from the usual Western heros.  He may be fast on the draw, but it is always as a last resort.  He much prefers to use his wits to solve the problems.  I was sorry to see this series end.",1419724800,,262,4.078431372549019
