8733918,1,B00005OCQM,"I ordered this on the 15th of January and I just received this today, January 22nd, so the time frame wasn't bad.  What was disappointing was that I opted to buy the NEW tape and when I received it, I could tell right away that it wasn't NEW because the actual VHS box it came in was worn around the edges and it looked like it had been resealed. When I put the tape in to play, based on the verbage on the review and the back of the box, you think you are going to see entire matches but you don't. It immediately starts off with snippets of different matches that go one right into the other and it looks like an amateur taped it off of his home collection of old World Class Wrestling from TV episodes.  The tape quality was very poor and the announcers were difficult to hear and the tracking was so messed up that no amount of my working with it got it to play correctly.  There was NOTHING that indicated this was a home video thrown together.  You think you are buying a professionally made tape.  I would not buy from this seller again.",1200960000,,1044,4.174129353233831
