8196541,3,B000QJ1WY8,"I watched the Glocks Pistols DVD plus the Glock Armorer's Course DVD, both of them are OK but lack of knowledge in the instuctor explanations. Many times the instructor Robert ""Bob"" Dunlap, will be providing wrong information and details about the ""does and dont's"" of the Glock and you can see him doing the wrong thing over and over like holding the slide in one hand and pulling the firing pin back to the rearmost position and realeasing it to function test if is working or not. I'm sure he doesn't know or realize that there is a differnt way to do this test and the way he's doing it may damage the firing pin and/or firing pins safety. He also keeps refering to parts like ""this funny looking thing goes here and that thing goes there"" simple because he doesn't know the actual name of the parts. For a little bit he confused me when he was talking about a metal can or cube? but I realized he was refering to the ""locking block"" so.... this keeps going thru the whole disassembly and reassembly process. Looks like he did a quick review of the Glock pistol before he made this two DVD's or maybe because the instructor favors S&W pistols as he keeps comparing them over and over. But anyhow..... and obviously, this are not official Glock Pistols and/or Armorer's course DVD's. AGI overall does produce quality instructional videos but these one lacks..
Because of this I decided to go for the Lenny Magill's videos, ""Complete Glock  Disassembly/Reassembly"" New Updated Edition 2009 that covers all Glocks made to date including the SF series. Also ""Mastering the Mini-Glock"" DVD, both are head & shoulders above this AGI effort. If you are in the market for something more than the basics, skip AGI's Glocks series DVD's.",1231113600,22,1731,4.675409836065573
