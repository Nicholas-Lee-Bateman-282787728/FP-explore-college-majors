Only thing I didn't like was that of course Bizzy Bone wasn't in the movie, but other then that a real great movie! Don't sleep on it.",1223251200,,310,4.271186440677966

2882753,4,B000S6LTGA,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting a whole from the movie, but after the film was finished all I can say is Bravo! The story is pretty well thought out with twists and turns till the very end. Plus, if you're a BTNH fan, you'll recognize a whole lot of characters in the movie. The bonus behind the scenes and making of is also a nice special feature worth giving a look. Most inarguably worth the money to add this DVD to a collection!  The only downside is there's no Cleveland in the movie.  It is understandable why, though, once you see the special features.",1191974400,3,557,4.398058252427185
2882754,5,B000S6LTGA,"This is a good movie for any true bone thugs fan, it's a great twist of events. Everything that happens in the movie isn't what you would expect to happen. It's all a surprise, so go cope it and support my dudes, and I know that you won't be disappointed. Nice lil behind the scenes footage too, just go get ASAP and find out for yo self!",1190851200,9,338,4.059701492537314

8204520,4,B000S6LTGA,"And old favorite by a classic group, full of thug and harmony to the bone as promised.",1416441600,,86,4.117647058823529
8204521,5,B000S6LTGA,"Bone thugs star in the action packed movie ""I tried"". Great story with suprisingly good screen performances by the group. I love the whole ""what if"" theme throughout the movie because life would of definetely been different if Bone thugs what have never met Eazy E. I have been a fan of Bone thugs since day one and I have all of their albums. I always loved the track ""I tried"" and I was not suprised that the song raced up the charts and became another platinum hit for Bone thugs. I was very excited when I heard that bone thugs was putting out a semi biographical movie named after ""I tried"", which is a deep movie with twists and turns in the story line. A very compelling and intimate look behind the scenes of pre superstardom Bone thugs and harmony.  I wish Bizzy Bone and Flesh Bone could of have particpated in this great movie, but Layzie, Krayzie, and wish bone held down the fort. Great movie by one of the absolute greatest hip-hop groups of all time. I know Eazy E is smiling down on his lil' brothers that he put on 20 years ago as his last discovery with pride. Bone thugs not only created a untouchable body of work musically, but Bone thugs has kept Eazy E legacy alive eternally until they see him again at the ""cross roads"". Thank God that Bone thugs kept the faith and ""tried"" to make it out the hood.  They made it!!!!  Peace",1410998400,,1348,4.320158102766799
8204522,5,B000S6LTGA,"I love Bone Thugs N Harmony. Hopefully if they make a new film, Bizzy and Flesh would be in it. This movie is one of my favorites next to ""Jacked Up"" Bone Thugs N Harmony are the best and always will be. Love you Eazy-E you will always be missed.!!!!!!!",1379808000,,253,4.08
8204523,5,B000S6LTGA,its good movie & when i saw it on vh1 or bet i knew i had to buy it for my collection so i watch it again & got real hype about it & i love when the song i tried came on in the ending a shame they don't make new songs }=,1344816000,,220,3.0925925925925926
8204524,5,B000S6LTGA,"BEING A FAN OF ""BONES THUGS AND HARMONY"", I BASICALLY LIKE ANYTHING THEY PUT OUT. BUT THIS IS NOT A MOVIE DESIGNED FOR ALL EARS.",1257984000,,128,4.16
8204525,1,B000S6LTGA,the movie skipped all througt it i ask for a replacement but won't sent one  so the movie stinks.,1233360000,,97,4.105263157894737
8204526,4,B000S6LTGA,"Im a big Bone Thugs fan and when I first got this, I couldn't wait to open it.  Basically it talks about how life would be like if they didn't jump on the bus to meet up with Easy E.  Its like a ""what if"" type scenario.  I loved this DVD, so pick one up as they have music that I didn't hear of yet.",1229299200,,299,3.5692307692307694
