7799567,5,1590383672,Absolutely amazing!! But what would you expect from John Bytheway!! He takes hard to talk about  topics and Turns them into easy to listen to and understand concepts. He doesn't just tell you the rules but the reasons why they are in place and how to maintain them!! We used this as a fireside and paused at different portions so we could discuss them with our youth. It is a must see for sure!!,1478390400,,395,4.337837837837838
