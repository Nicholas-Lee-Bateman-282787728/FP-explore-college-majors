1356041,1,B00004UD5Q,"Let me start by prefacing that I am a huge fan of bad film, and this film is the worst ever.  I was originally dared by my high-school English teacher to watch this film for extra credit and fell in love with it.  The  premise: Nazi troops preserve Hitler's brain (actually his entire head) in  order to save his strategic saavy and flee to South America.  Of course,  Nazi hunters happen to run into them and discover the *shocking* truth  about their plan to use Hitler's Head on a Box to rise again and dominate  the world.  The Nazi hunters foil their plan and save the day. What makes  this film truly enjoyable is that you'll spend the entire time trying to  figure out what is going on.  The beginning of the film was shot 20 years  after the rest of the footage and has 70's b-movie actors discovering the  Nazi hideout in South America, leading to the gratuitous exploding car.  Then we are whisked away to South America, the original film stock, where  the rest of the movie unfolds. The funniest thing about this film is that  the Nazis preserved Hitler so he could say two words over and over again:  'Hurry up!' (translated from the German).  Good thing they saved his head!  This film is bad, bad, bad; so bad it is enjoyable to watch, just like an  Ed Wood film.",963878400,3,1277,4.394849785407725

1356043,5,B00004UD5Q,"Although They Saved Hitler's Brain is ridiculously bad, the movie that it's paired with, The Frozen Dead, is one of the best post-WW2 explorations of the evil that the Nazis wrought on the world.

In an attempt to resurrect the Third Reich, former Nazi officers have put 1500 of the Nazi elite into cryogenic suspension, commissioning Dr. Norberg [Dana Andrews] to revive them. So far, the experiments have been a failure, leaving the revived demented and debilitated. What Dr. Norberg needs is a living, disembodied brain, to study its inner workings. When his niece Jean [Anna Palk] and her friend Elsa [Kathleen Breck] , Norberg's assistant seizes the opportunity and kills her. Dr Norberg separates Elsa's head from her body and conducts experiments in her ability to control other dismembered body parts. But Elsa has more powers than Dr. Norberg knows, and is plotting her revenge. An excellent exploration of the nature of evil and the will.

It's too bad that The Frozen Dead isn't available outside of dreadful collections of films, but this one is worth the price of the double-feature.",1288742400,5,1096,5.016483516483516
1356044,5,B00004UD5Q,"""They Saved Hitler's Brain"" is a cinematic travesty made over a decade or so by two different sets of people, starring two different sets of actors. What could possibly go wrong? The basis for the film is the very short 1963 feature ""The Madmen of Mandoras"", which was apparently shot years earlier and shelved for a while. In the late 1960s (1968 seems the most agreed upon date), some television brain trust wanted to broadcast ""The Madmen of Mandoras"", but it was too short to fit in a traditional movie time slot. They hired some film school students to shoot additional wraparound footage to boost the running time. The result is one of the most jarring viewing experiences in cinema history, and ranks up there with the very best of Ed Wood or Ray Dennis Steckler for enjoyable camp viewing.

The film opens with the newly shot footage of a smarmy male and a voluptuous female CID agent arguing and engaging in possibly the worst banter in film history. The acting and writing will both make you cringe; the good news is you frequently can't hear what's being said over the loud background music. It seems that the CID is investigating the death of a scientist who was working of the G-Gas project. The dead scientist knew of the antidote, and they discover that Dr. John Coleman, another brilliant scientist, has been kidnapped and taken to the South American country of Mandoras.

The G-Gas plot sort of devolves into a ""Wild, Wild World of Batwoman"" pursuit of evildoers, with the movie going on to feature crazy Nazis planning to take over the world, Hitler's head in a jar (who the cast refers to as ""Mr. H"") yelling orders in German, a brain dead kidnapping and murder subplot, lots of stock footage, a supremely annoying and pathetic romance subplot, ridiculously inept car chases, doublecrosses, gunplay, explosions, a fire, and Hitler's head melting. Everything is here but the kitchen sink, and that may be here too, just too grainy and out of focus to see.

For someone who adores nonsensical B-movies, ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"" is a film to marvel at, and I particularly recommend it as a double feature with ""The Thing With Two Heads"".",1268179200,,2156,4.759358288770054

1356046,1,B00004UD5Q,"One of the all-time bombs of cinematic history!  Ranks right up there with the ""best"" (worst?) of Ed Wood.  Actually two movies in one - the relatively short (for a feature film) ""Madmen of Mandoras"" released in 1963 (which ran something over 60 minutes), and a new subplot, filmed years later by students in UCLA's Film School, which is clumsily woven in.

As with much Bad Cinema, it's hard to pin down all the relevant facts.  While most references give 1963 as the year of release for ""Madmen of Mandoras"", some state that it was largely filmed in the late Fifties.  It was not uncommon for clunkers such as this to sit on the shelf for several years.  At any rate, this schlocky sci-fi ""thriller"", which gives us unrepentant Nazis plotting to takeover the world years after the end of WWII (and led by the disembodied head of no less than Adolph Hitler), returned to the vaults after release and was largely forgotten by the movie-going public.

Years later, in either the late 1960's or early 1970's (depending on who you believe), ""Madmen of Mandoras"" was dusted off for recycling onto television.  Many old Fifties/Early Sixties sci-fi and horror films were getting a new lease on life on TV through syndication.  Problem with ""Madmen"" was that, with such a short running time, it wouldn't fit into regular movie slots on the local stations.  So the UCLA Film School was hired to pad ""Madmen"" with new scenes.  Some references give 1968 as the year this took place, but it's difficult to tell from the finished scenes....it might have been early 1970's.

At any rate, they used six actors for these ""new"" scenes, and came up with a very contrived sub-plot that loosely tied into the original storyline.  The first 25+ minutes are mostly devoted to this new footage, which involves a secret ""G-Gas"" nerve agent, and it's antidote.  The antidote formula is stolen out of a government lab by Nazi spy Dr. Bernard, who then dies when his car is blown up by other Nazi agents, along with the formula.  Evidently the Nazis already have G-Gas;  they just don't want the antidote known to the government.  Bernard's murder brings in the government agency ""CID"", which may be the Counter Intelligence Division of the FBI (though this is never explained).  Russ Van Pelt, a CID bureau chief (and closet Nazi) goes through the motions of investigating Dr. Bernard's death, assigning agents Vic Gilbert and Toni Gordon to the case.  To his chagrin, Van Pelt finds out from Vic that a certain Professor Coleman actually developed the G-Gas antidote, not Bernard.  Suddenly Professor Coleman is a target.

Some old footage is worked in at this point, showing Professor Coleman briefing government officials on G-Gas.  Then after the briefing Coleman meets his son-in-law, CID Agent Phil Day (the real star of the original ""Madmen of Mandoras"") and Coleman's assistant Frank Dvorak (another Nazi spy).  Then it's back to the ""modern"" footage, which shows CID agents Vic and Toni meeting to discuss the case -- she pulls up to Vic's cheap-looking apartment in a Volkswagen beetle!  (Great cover for a government agent....)  The two verbally spar, and some ""comic relief"" is thrown in at female agent Toni's expense, then get down to business.

The most jarring aspect of this interspersing of new footage with old is how dated it makes the original film look!  In the ""Madmen"" scenes, everyone is conservatively dressed and the guys all have short hair.  In the UCLA footage, the guys have ""mod"" clothes and hair styles.  One reviewer noted that the finished product was a forced marriage of Fifties conservatism and Sixties hippies!  Even the music score of the UCLA scenes doesn't fit with the rest of the movie.  Also, while ""Madmen"" didn't boast any first-rate stars, the actors at least came off as professional.  For the UCLA cast, it's strictly ""amateur night"".  And, oddly enough, though both were shot in black & white, the older film looks better and crisper than the newer film!

Of course neither of the ""new"" stars, Vic and Toni, bear any resemblance to real government agents, nor is their dialog convincing in the least.  Vic resembles a sleazy porn star, while Toni comes off as a klutzy dumb-blonde.  The two Nazi thugs they battle wear dark business suits and sunglasses, but have long hair, and one reviewer likened them to Blues Brothers Jake and Elwood!  At any rate, Professor Coleman is kidnapped by these goons.  First Toni, then Vic, try and save the professor, but both are killed by the Nazi thugs.  Vic's car is shown running into a electric transformer (in a scene lifted from 1958's ""Thunder Road"").  With Vic's death, so ends the ""new"" UCLA footage.

From then on it's all old ""Madmen of Mandoras"" film, as Agent Phil Day and his wife Kathy (whom he calls K.C.) travel to Mandoras to rescue Professor Coleman.  After some stock airplane footage, and some tedious scenes of their arrival in Mandoras and meeting the local police chief, they finally learn of a Nazi scheme towards the end of WWII to keep Hitler alive (or at least his head).  Bill Freed plays Hitler in the flashbacks, mostly screaming at doctors and waiving his arms wildly around.  Apparently the Nazis in Mandoras. still lead by their ""head man"" Hitler, are plotting to conquer the world with the dreaded G-Gas!  We are told they have agents all over the world ready to release it.....however it's not explained just why Professor Coleman should be kidnapped and held captive by the Nazis, instead of simply being killed.  They already have G-Gas, and it would seem the wise course to silence forever the only man who knows how to make the antidote (???).

Finally after Phil & K.C. are captured do we get to see the Nazi underground bunker and the disembodied noggin of the Fuhrer in a large pickle jar, mounted on a box with electronic dials!  The distance shots use a wax head, while the close-ups are of a sneering Bill Freed.  Then we see the Fuhrer-head in the jar riding around in the back seat of a car as the Nazi plan is put into effect.  Absolutely hilarious!  Makes ""The Brain that Wouldn't Die"" look like high art.  In the end our heroic duo saves the day with a few hand grenades -- blowing up the Nazis, and burning to death Hitler's (wax-version) head.",1252022400,,6259,4.7641597028783655

1356048,4,B00004UD5Q,"If you love bad movies then you have fallen upon one of the worst movies you will probably ever see next to Plan 10 From Outer Space, that is They Saved Hitler's Brain. This movie made me laugh like no other, that's because no other film can come close to how bad it was.  At one point I fell asleep and woke up and was watching a whole new film. That's because it is two different films put together like Frankenstein's monster. The movie tries though it tries like a man with no thumbs trying to hitchhike, funny but sad at the same time. But I love these B movies that are so bad they are good to a certain extreme. But seriously if you like bad movies then this is a gem, a perfect gem. And it's about time you can find this stuff on DVD.
 Then you stumble into another movie about preserving Nazis which is The Frozen Dead. This movie is a little bit better than the previous but it is also in its own world of bad. But that is what makes it good, the awesomely badness of the whole thing. When you see dead frozen Nazis stand up and walk around you will laugh like no other. Plus the acting is top notch that adds a perfect touch to the whole thing. These two movies together create a perfect storm of campy, tasteless perfectness. That explains this double feature DVD perfectly tasteless, campy fun. It's perfect for movie nights with friends or just for a good laugh on your own.  I bought this for my friend and I am truly jealous and I think that I should have bought it for myself.

1356053,5,B00004UD5Q,"Oh what a hoot. I'm giving this film 5 stars for a different reason. Movies that are so bad they are 'good' make my day. 'Cat Women of the Moon', 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', and 'Robot Monster' all have a certain charm that exceeds the actual film. 'They saved Hitler's Brain' is another such movie. I give it 5 stars when thrown on with other famous bad movies, it holds it's own. It has everything a bad movie fan could want. An inane plot, mediocre acting at best, and the over the top 'not so special' effects.

A small Carribean Island called Manduras is a hideout for Nazis who want to take over the world. And why shouldn't they try again? Der Fuhrer is among them as a head in a glass jar. Guess that's where Matt Groening got the idea for his incredible 'Futurama' cartoon show. Listening to the little Hitler head in the glass jar barking out orders is just a hoot. I also loves how he just moves his eyes from side to side looking all sinister and stuff.

My two favorite scenes are the car chase and hotel fight. The car chase is right out of the mind of Ed Wood. They start driving in daylight, then the headlights are on in the dark, then at the crash, it's light again. Brilliant! It's too bad that agent died. With that hair and mustache he looked like Sony Bono meets Journey's Steve Perry. His very appearance was pure camp. Then you got the hotel scene. She hits the wrong guy with the lamp. How could she be so stupid?

A lot of people will say how much they love the ""Hitler head melting"" scene. Sure it's cool, but you have 92 minutes of pure hilarity to enjoy before the big climax.

1356054,2,B00004UD5Q,"Why am I drawn to bad movies like a fly to a steaming pile of excrement (this metaphor is exceptionally appropriate given the film being reviewed)?  I've never really given it much thought, but I suppose it's a similar reaction people display when driving by a particularly bad car wreck...you don't want to look, but morbid curiosity is a compelling, often intrinsic, trait among humans.  As far as car wrecks go, cinematically speaking, They Saved Hitler's Brain (1963) is a real doozy...the film is actually two movies (the original made in the late 50's to early 60's but never released for some unknown reason, and new footage filmed in the mid to late 60's) spliced together, like some twisted Frankenstein experiment.  Apparently the company that owned the original film, Crown International (purveyors of schlock), got some UCLA film students to produce the new footage, and then, in an extremely futile attempt, married the two in the unholy union that is this film (director Al Adamson made a career on doing this, most notably with his 1971 monster mash Dracula Vs. Frankenstein).

The film, originally titled Madmen of Mandoras aka Amazing Mr. H aka The Return of Mr. H (before the celluloid mating) was directed by David Bradley, whose earlier films include a juvenile delinquent picture titled Dragstrip Riot (1958) and the epic sci-fi craptacular 12 to the Moon (1960).  The film stars Walter Stocker (Lassie's Great Adventure) and Audrey Caire, who seemed vaguely familiar, but I couldn't place her until I looked up her credits as saw she also appeared in Joe (1970), one of my more favorite films of the early 70's.  Also appearing is John Holland (The Naked Brigade), Carlos Rivas (True Grit), Marshall Reed (Ghost of Zorro), Scott Peters (Panic in Year Zero!), Nestor Paiva (The Three Stooges in Orbit, Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter), and Bill Freed (who later adapted Dean R. Koontz's novel Watchers into the 1988 film of the same name) as Adolf Hitler, or, at least his head.

The film starts out with the newer footage (which actually looks worse than the older footage), relating some kind of story regarding secret agents, nerve gas, and various murders.  The main character, named Vic (who looks a lot like Chuck Negron, the original lead singer from the 70's band Three Dog Night) is a secret agent assigned to investigate the death of a scientist, but he himself eventually dies in a fiery car crash (actually his death is represented by footage taken from the 1958 feature Thunder Road, starring Robert Mitchum).  All of this takes about 27 minutes, and then we cut into another film, already in progress, featuring the actors I listed above (the actors in the newer footage are not listed in any credits).  From here we follow the exploits of Phil Day (Stocker) and his wife Kathy (Caire) as they travel to the tiny Caribbean Island nation of Mandoras to locate Kathy's recently kidnapped father, a scientist who developed an antidote to a deadly nerve gas.  Phil and Kathy soon learn a handful of Nazis, lead by Hitler's head, and their nefarious plans to take control of the world.  Will Phil and Kathy be able to stop the madness, or will the Third Reich finally achieve the goals it set for itself some 20 years ago?  Their plan seems pretty rock solid, so things don't look good...

I'm unsure why the newer footage was added, especially since it matched up so poorly (it looked like a bunch of laid-back hippies running around, compared to the more conservatively attired characters in the original footage).  The original film is actually not a bad little B film (at least, compared to the newer footage), but I suspect some of the original footage may have been lost (or never filmed), hence the addition of the newer material, as to try and provide a setting for the older material.  Thing is, the newer stuff was shot so very poorly, lacking any sense of direction (hey, it's daytime...no wait, it's night...oops, it's daytime again), and I was able to piece together much of the intended story from the original footage I didn't need the newer material.  And that music for the newer material...27 minutes of really crummy free form jazz...the horror, the horror...the concept of saving Hitler's head seemed kinda cool, but what was probably meant to be a shocking surprise (the whole plot of Hitler's head plotting a conspiracy) was effectively ruined by the newer title.  The special effects are pretty much what you might expect, with Hitler's head, when not being carried around in a jar, sitting atop an older model videotape machine.  Freed's head did look a little creepy, sort of bug-eyed and slightly emaciated, with his only dialog, as a disembodied head, being `Mach Schnell! Mach Schnell!' (I guess one would probably get pretty cranky and impatient surviving in a jar, relying on the charity of others...I wonder which lackey got the job of trimming his little moustache?)  My favorite scene has to be when Phil and Kathy get kidnapped by a mysterious Hispanic man, and as they come to a stop light, another car pulls up, shoots the Hispanic man dead, but the couple, who are in the car with the now dead man, don't realize he's dead until much later, eventually stuffing his corpse into a phone booth, the intent being someone will find him (and someone does, in the form of an impatient, rotund lady wanting to use said phone...oh the comedy!)

The Rhino release specifies this is the uncut, 92-minute version (it felt much longer), newly transferred from 35mm elements.  The picture quality isn't all that great, but it's probably the best you'll find, surpassing that old VHS copy you own.  The audio is about as good as the picture quality (which is to say not all the great).  There is a menu (featuring a nifty animated Hitler head), and a listing of other Rhino titles.

This extra footage was possibly a project of some UCLA film students, to create a longer movie for television.
  It is unfortunate that these more recent actors are not in the film credits, since the newer footage is more fun to watch than the original, except for one thing: the head of the Fuhrer.  Hitler's head provides the much needed comic relief for the drab situations, mostly by showing some kinds of unrecognizable expressions, and yelling ""Mach Schnell!"" (colloq: buck up).

That is, of course, they couldn't join in with the other actors ten years back in time.
The rest of the movie isn't much better - forget about the storyline. You sit around the whole time thinking: ""When does the story start - wheres the action, the thrill, the humor, the sense?""
Even my hopes for an evil, entriguing or even power-mad super-villianous Hitler were eradicated. This guy (who by the way don't looks a bit like the old ""Grfaz"") just stares out of his jar and, I suppose, wonders, why not one of his plain stupid Nazi henchmen speaks one word German.
The rest is 50s B-Movie standart: Screaming girl, smart hero, dead villains, etc.. The damn brain - which is the whole head in truth - not even gets a cool showdown or death scene. It simply burns to death in its car - still staring around helpless.

The existing prints must be in poor shape.  Despite the advertisement that it is a ""new transfer from 35 mm film elements,"" the picture suffers from scratches, jitters, and a host of sound problems.  The soundtrack develops that machine-gun rattle that is so common in old prints that no longer track well for the screen.  Indeed, I have never heard this amount of hissing and cracking on a legitimate mainline DVD soundtrack.
Portions of the movie, mostly at the beginning, give a parallel storyline that was added by UCLA film students in the 1960's (1963 I believe).  It really does not sync with the older 1950's footage that features better acting and scripting.  Indeed, removal of the appended material might make for a better film.  It was added for theatrical length and to help flush out the kidnapping and secret weapon details.  All it really does is add length, stretching the movie to 92 minutes.  While some bad movies are fun, this one is just mostly bad.  Ed Wood could have done better.
Once the entire cast from the first part of the movie are killed off, the film starts in earnest with the older material.  The plot should be simple but the extraneous material confuses things.  Professor Coleman has created an antidote to a potent new nerve gas.  He is kidnapped by Nazis holding up in Mandoras (South America).  The evil men worship Hitler's animated head in a mason jar.  The professor's daughter and son-in-law must save the day before the Nazis take over the world.
The identities of the actors in the added material are not clarified.  The film was also called MADMEN OF MANDORAS and THE RETURN OF MR. H.  There are several bloopers, much related to the harsh transition between the 1960's and 1950's cultures (dress, music, dance, etc.).  There is also a car chase where shots alternate between night and day.
Here is a little tidbit.  Bill Freed, who plays Hitler's head in a jar, would later author the screenplay for Koontz' book, THE WATCHERS.

i purchased and viewed, its as strange a i remember it.
The first 1/3rd of the film runs like a home made movie that they
appended to the film..once gone the film is more interesting.
Nothing like seeing Hitler's head on that box with lots of dials
on it. One movie that should make your bad movie collection",1032998400,,372,4.109589041095891
1356061,5,B00004UD5Q,"I first saw this in the wee hours of the morning, several years before the proliferation of the video tape recorder.  I remembered it and watched it again when it turned up a year or two later.  I've always thought that watching bad movies in the wee hours when you're half asleep is the only way to go.  Watching them on video destroys the ambience!  The movie is indeed a pastiche of two separate films with separate casts, shot years apart.  However, I take issue with Leonard Maltin and the others who refer to the Stanley Cortez footage as being from the 1950s.  The actors are dancing The Twist in the Dos Palabras club in one scene.  The Twist became a craze in the Fall of 1960, and remained all the rage for the next couple of years.  The original Madmen of Mandoras was released in 1963 (I have a 22X28 poster, complete set of lobby cards, and some stills from this flick); all this is consistent with an early '60s filming of the Cortez footage.  The added footage was probably filmed in the late 60s.  I have the autographs of a number of the cast members of this masterpiece.  Nestor Paivia, who plays the police chief, is perhaps best remembered as the skipper of the skiff in Creature from the Black Lagoon.  Joe Bob sez check it out.",979084800,3,1249,4.406113537117904

7923854,5,B00004UD5Q,"What is there to possibly say about a film with such depth, such breadth and such vision?

Briniging to mind the work of a young Lars Von Trier, the breathtaking scope of this feature leaves this reviewer baffled as to the lack of attention it received from that year's Academy Awards - perhaps the consequence of being light years ahead of its time in both theme and content. Even so, the incredible, timeless cinematography should have made it a cast-iron certainty for recognition.

Perhaps it was also a consequences of the Academy's well-known reluctance to recognise comedic brilliance, as few films can have tickled the ribs of so many as this work of outstanding genius.

Strange then that the director, and so few of the cast, failed to go on to greater things, despite the much vaunted release of ""Ski Patrol 2"", that in my humble opinion, surpassed even the undisputed mastery of the first feature.

I reccommend this film strongly to anyone with a genuine love of avant-garde cinema, and anyone sent to the video shop by their older brothers, who wants to bring back a sure fire winner for all the family.",1432771200,,1117,4.742268041237113

7923860,3,B00004UD5Q,"Madmen of Mandoras(1963) was a box office flop in the early 1960's. It vanished without any fanfare. In 1968, it was retitled They Saved Hitler's Brain and shown on TV with 30 minutes of filler scenes with two secret agents. The 1961 footage was shot by Hollywood veteran cinematographer Stanley Cortez and the 1968 footage has sloppy, grainy, blurry camera work shot by film students. The 1961 version shows a cute, sexy, nubile girl dancing to the Twist and the 1968 footage shows men with lots of facial hair, Mod clothing, and bell bottoms! They Saved Hitler's Brain is so bad, it's good. It has comic book style thrills. It also portrays Germans and Latinos as racial stereotypes. It takes place in the fictitious Latin American country of Mandoras. The German spoken in the film is just gibberish! In one scene, a woman yelled out, ""My dishes!"" as the camera rolled. That take is a part of the movie! They Saved Hitler's Brain(1969) has been spoofed on The Simpsons a few times. Bill Freed played Adolf Hitler's severed head. The film stars Walter Stocker, Audrey Caire, Carlos Rivas, Dani Lynn, and others. Tari Tabakin plays a female secret agent in the 1968 footage. The script was written by Steve Bennett and Peter Miles and directed by David Bradley. The film has some stock footage from a Robert Mitchum film! They Saved Hitler's Brain was a cult favorite of people who consumed a staple diet of TV in 1968. This is a must see for bad movie buffs.",1339200000,,1460,4.684824902723736
7923861,1,B00004UD5Q,"I enjoy cheesy and bad movies. I put on my DVD of 'Plan 9' every so often and enjoy watching it because it's so comically bad.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies - seek out a copy on the 'Net first, before you buy. (Just search for it - you'll find it.) It's worth watching once. You may find you like it and it will be worth purchasing.

However, I found this movie to be horribly boring. The plot is very hard to follow and the footage that was added makes it even more confusing. Supposedly new footage was added to make it long enough to show on TV. It's very obvious what footage was tacked on. I can't believe they got sponsors for the TV showing.

I did enjoy seeing Hitler's head in a jar and also the bad guys dressed as the Blue's Brothers. Beyond that, nothing was worth watching. I only watched it all the way through to see the end.",1321574400,,846,4.115151515151515
7923862,1,B00004UD5Q,"I don't know what most of these other reviewers were smoking (come to think of it),that's probably the only conceivable explanation for their unfathomably positive reviews!  Now, I LOVE bad movies.  Some the biggest stinkers ever made, usually on non-existant budgets, are (unintentionally) hilarious and make for great viewing.  Not this, however.  First of all, this incomprehensible mess drags on for an hour and half during which little of any interest whatsoever happens.  Perhaps edited down to, say, ten minutes, this turkey would provide a few moments of hilarity from its sheer ineptitude.  But the camp elements that might have made ""Brain"" at least midly entertaining are almost completely absent, i.e. Hitler's head, when it does finally appear, says virtually nothing.  A large part of the running time is of cars driving around or people walking.  Pointless.  The dialogue and acting lacks the requisite outrageousness that would have put this up there in the ""Plan 9"" or ""Robot Monster"" ranks.  A complete waste of time, even for lovers of bad film.  Rhino should be ashamed for puttin' this out.  The one star rating that is the least that Amazon allows for a product is too generous.  Rhino's dvd might have been worth a star had they bothered to provide an original edit of ""Madmen"" sans the god-awful later additions as a supplement to the print included on this disc. Avoid.",1298678400,,1394,5.008695652173913
