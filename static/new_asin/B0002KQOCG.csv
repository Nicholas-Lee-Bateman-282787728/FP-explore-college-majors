2100538,5,B0002KQOCG,"This traces, via modern tchnology, the Amazons, warrior-women who fought at Troy.  Using DNA, clothing, customs, science follows the women who went north and east at war's end, and finds their daughters, several times removed, blonde, brilliant horsewomen, riding the plains of Mongolia.

As is so often the case, myth and legend prove to be true.

Watch it with your daughters!",1124409600,5,378,5.163934426229508
2100539,4,B0002KQOCG,"This film takes you along an Anthropologists hunt for the descendents of the infamous Amazons, a society of female warriors heralded in ancient literature and art. Follow along as Dr. Davis-Kimball, along with her colleagues, discovers an ancient burial ground in Russia that bears up tall skeletons dressed in gold beads, follow as they extract mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA, which is passed on from mother to daughter down through the generations) from the skeletons, follow as Dr. Davis-Kimball tracks the Amazons through Greek literature and art, and finally follow her to the steppes of southeast Russia to an isolated Nomad family that just might be descended from a small group of the Amazons. These lost Amazons, who were captured by the Greek army and then overtook their captors, found a new land and intermarried with and fought next to the men they found there.

I found very little to criticize about the film. The stories of the Amazons in Greek literature suggested that Dr. Davis-Kimball search out Caucasoid features in the nomadic peoples. And in the film she is surprised when a forensic scientist creates a skeletal reconstruction that looks like no known people and has brown hair. My question is, why does she make such a big deal about the brown hair when the hair color was entirely speculative anyway? In addition, between scenes, there are clips of skinny blond model-like women with swords (it is highly improbable that the Amazons would have been lightly built, as they would not have had sufficient strength for battle). I suppose they were shown as contrast to Davis-Kimball's actual discoveries and as illustrations of the Greek myths, but they were also somewhat distracting from the science of the film.

There is much to learn from this film, from Greek art, to the rarely seen culture of the steppes people, to the ancient topography of the land, to genetics. Being a scientist myself, I can say that the science is superb and it is refreshing to see the mitochondrial (maternal) DNA followed, as another recently popularized researcher erroneously stated that the only way to track human evolution is to follow the Y-Chromosome, only found in men.

The film is not intended to be a thorough investigation into the mythical Amazon culture, but is about discovering the true Amazon women, from whose stature and deeds the myths were borne.",1121385600,27,2368,5.00507614213198
2100540,3,B0002KQOCG,"That's what this program attempts to discover, although the answer isn't clear.  Some tantalizing clues are unearthed, like a 2000-year-old massive burial mound that was used for what seems to be a female warrior/ruler.  And amazingly, a DNA link between these remains and a girl now living on the Asian steppes is found.  But these are only clues, and not proof, of a band of women warriors.  For now, the legend of these warriors remains in the realm of myth, awaiting more discoveries...",1107820800,4,490,4.867469879518072
2100541,5,B0002KQOCG,"I viewed this show on PBS, am happy to find it on DVD. This is actually about a search for the proof of the Amazon women( and I do not mean Amazon.com women!). It helps to purchase the book- Warrior Women, by Mona Behan and Jeannine Davis-Kimball, from which this documentary is derived. J Davis-Kimball is an archaeologist who discovered compelling evidence that supports the truth of legends of these women. She went on a quest through Southern Russia, Mongolia, etc, tracking her hunches, examining forgotten burial remains in back rooms, spending months on digs in remote areas, and as the DVD pointed out, sampling DNA and looking at links to the current cultural ways of the area. There were photos of burials of higher order- women in tall head dress and ornament, buried with bows and other weapons. The archaeologist found links between these Mongolian women and Scythians, other past peoples,  who traveled far across the Roman Empire to fight as mercenaries. There are roots with peoples of horse cultures. The book is fascinating, and I found the documentary filled in with more info.

Although I watched this movie with the book's background info, a friend of mine with a longstanding interest in Amazon women, watched it without having any knowledge of the book, and stated it was very, very good. It IS an amazing achievement too, to be able to search for the genetic link with modern forensic technique. This documentary was presented as a mystery. Part of the program tracks a young Mongolian tribal girl, who is one of a very few born occasionally with more Caucasian type features and hair, looking for evidence of her genetic link with the women of legend. I highly recommend this PBS Special and the book by the same archaeologist- Jeannine Davis-Kimball called Warrior Women. Both great!",1098921600,16,1809,4.908496732026144
2100542,2,B0002KQOCG,"To start with, and to be fair, the ""Secrets of the Dead - Amazon Warrior Women"" is not uninteresting in and of itself. We do see how a young nomadic girl is linked genetically to a 2000 year old skeleton. Again, not an uninteresting bit of info.

However, I expected the show to be specifically about Amazons; their culture, the debate between myth and reality, etc. What we see, in reality, is an archeologist's attempts at genetically linking modern day nomads with ""ancient"" nomads. These ancient nomads are not necessarily Amazons though they sparked, in theory, the ""Amazon myth"".

Long story short, this PBS production is worth taking a look at if you are more interested in forensics and genetic research / testing than Amazons. Though, if you are like me and want to see a show dedicated specifically to Amazons then this may not be the production for you.

*As a side note, I would recommend ""The Real Eve"". It does not have anything to do with Amazons but it explains the theory of the origins of humanity by way of one women and a specific genetic strain.*",1096761600,15,1067,4.634920634920635
8028462,5,B0002KQOCG,"I like Secrets of the Dead in general but this episode I HAD to own. Its not available to buy on streaming services so I was happy to find it on DVD. Personally, I think PBS charges too much for single episodes of their shows. I was lucky, after months of searching, to find a copy for less than $20. This episode is very well done, as are other episodes. The research was thorough and extensive. It was really awesome to see the researchers find living descendants of the Amazon warrior women.",1489190400,,494,4.380434782608695

8028464,5,B0002KQOCG,The Amazon Warrior Women were a great part of classical history when I was young.  I always wondered where they came from and where they went after the fall of Troy.  This PBS special traces a possible destination and a modern Eastern tribe that may be descedents of these women.  A possible companion book is Stephen Turnbull's Warrior Women of Japan.,1365638400,,352,4.737704918032787
8028465,5,B0002KQOCG,"My wife and I met Jeannine Davis-Kimball a number of years ago and she spoke of this material and her excavations. In addition to finding real warrior priestess princesses, she has also discovered proto-Celts among the sites in the Russian steppes, complete with a finely-woven plaid that would look at home on any Scottish girl. The most amazing thing, though isn't the discovery of what were likely the Amazons of Greek legend, but the link to living descendants today in the remote regions of Mongolia. Her book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warrior-Women-An-Archaeologist-s-Search-for-History-s-Hidden-Heroines/dp/0446679836/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warrior Women: An Archaeologist's Search for History's Hidden Heroines</a>&nbsp;is also worthwhile reading.

8028468,5,B0002KQOCG,"At the time I watched this I was doing research for a fictional work.  This DVD basically follows the travels and chronicles the research of Jeannine Davis-Kimball, an archaeologist, who is trying to find proof that the myth of the Amazons stemmed from an actual tribe of female warriors.  Her finds are absolutely amazing!

If you have any interest at all in the Amazons from Greek legend this DVD is at least worth a rent.  I own it and have since watched it several times in a short while.  I also recommend reading Dr. Davis-Kimball's book ""Warrior Women An Archaeologist's Search for History's Hidden Heroines"".

Enjoy!",1250640000,,624,4.839622641509434
