3773369,3,B001R4XRLC,"There are several explicit sex scenes in M&aacute;ncora that I personally enjoyed; and at the beginning of the movie, I really thought I had a winner in artistic terms as well.  From the picture and summary on the DVD cover, I quickly realized that during an excursion to a Peruvian beach resort, Santiago would have sex with his sister-in-law, Ximena.  I imagined that the movie might explore the moral and psychological consequences of this ""boundary-crossing and betrayal.""

To a certain extent, there was such an exploration, but the narrative thread of M&aacute;ncora just went too limp in the movie's middle.  Instead of concentrating on the triad of Santiago-Ximena-I&ntilde;igo, there were numerous scenes that really took the film nowhere and dissipated the dramatic tension.

I don't consider M&aacute;ncora a bad movie; but for anyone with limited viewing time, there are much better Spanish-language films to be seen.",1268956800,15,929,5.335616438356165
