8426759,3,B004ECG612,"A dangerously underwritten police officer portrayed by a rather uncharismatic Tony Curtis quits his day job in order to be in proximity to a person of interest . Curtis is not a detective but has a hunch based on a huge tell the directer hands us minutes into the film . The true interest within the film comes via the gregarious performance of Gilbert Roland as the patriarch of a colorful and loving family . After being insinuated into this clan , Curtis's  character becomes conflicted and develops one of those instant , mix with milk romances with a stunning family member . Mediocre but worth a look . Inexplicably earns a 7 out of 10 from the aggregate film destination IMDb .",1525219200,,684,4.560975609756097
8426760,5,B004ECG612,I love 1950's Tony Curtis movies.......This one is terrific. I remember seeing it in a movie theatre when I was a teen and haven't seen it since. I was very happy to see it after all these years.....loved it just as much. Recommend it to all Tony Custis fans.,1378252800,,259,4.3061224489795915
