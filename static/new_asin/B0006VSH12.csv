8043628,5,B0006VSH12,"What I like about this DVD is that it's not ""dumbed down"".  Lots of creative ideas for decorating the house for Christmas but it's intelligently written-which is rare for how-to decorating shows.  I also liked the party ideas.  No recipes, no cooking demos-just a lot of good advice on how to be a gracious party Host.  I highly recommend it.",1135900800,4,342,4.65

8043630,5,B0006VSH12,"The Christmas tree decorating ideas in this video are worth the price of the video alone.  You know when you go to the fancy stores and hotels during the holidays and wonder how they get their Christmas trees to look so fabulous?  I could never get my tree to look like that.  Last year, I bought some beautiful ribbon, but when I put it on the tree, it looked stupid so I pulled it right off.  Now I know the ""designer trick"".  You have to make a loop in the ribbon first, and then you tie it with a pipe cleaner and attach it to the tree branch!  The designer also uses sheer fabric instead of garland - it lets the lights twinkle through.  Very nice.  You can see the designers decorating this tree on this video's home cite.  Just enter the art of holiday design (you know the rest).  This video's got tons of designer tips. Check out the party ideas, too!  This video gets my ""thumbs up""!",1131667200,,893,4.224852071005917
8043631,5,B0006VSH12,What a great video! Fabulous Christmas decorating ideas. I started watching the video when my husband walks into the room. My husband is a sports & Law and Order kind of a guy. He pretty much hates all the home and garden shows I like to watch. BUT...he sat down and watched the whole video with me! This is a first in our house. I loved the Christmas history and the cool graphics.  We both loved the chocolate decorating ideas. They show this one designer that's a real chocoholic. She makes chocolate topiaries and chocolate ornaments! She even drizzles melted chocolate on candlesticks!! She says you can smell the chocolate as the candles burn down. How cool is that!!,1131580800,,673,4.65546218487395
8043632,5,B0006VSH12,"Unlike many how-to videos, this one is well-written and beautifully produced.  It features designer Pamela Green, celebrity floral designer Ron Morgan and a host of other designers, holiday stylists and professional party planners who share their tips and tricks for stylish Christmas decorating.  The charming host is Jill Scheetz; the setting is a contemporary living room which gets holiday-decorated in stages throughout the program.

In the Christmas decorating portion of the program, we see how professional designers ""brainstorm"" one creative idea after another.  As the design concepts are discussed, each idea is ""sketched in"" directly on the video screen.  This visualization method is very effective and is repeated throughout the program.  The host and designer select a ""music"" theme and start decorating the Christmas tree.  We learn the proper technique for installing Christmas tree lights and the importance of scale and what designers call ""focal points"".  Traditional garland is replaced by a combination of sheer fabric and a wide ribbon printed with a music score design.

I particularly enjoyed learning the history of the many holiday traditions.  In The Christmas Tree Story, the use of historical illustrations and archival photographs really brought the story to life.  It was interesting to learn the symbolism of the Christmas wreath and why evergreens are used to 'deck the halls'.  Very entertaining and educational.

The music theme is picked up in other Christmas decorating segments including ideas for decorating the windows with uniquely shaped wreaths.  The fireplace decorating scheme is particularly dramatic with a wrought-iron wall hanging in the shape of a music score with large Christmas tree ornaments serving as the ""musical notes"".

Renown floral designer and author Ron Morgan (""The Center of Attention"")demonstrates how easy it is to dress up a store-bought wreath with roses and lemons.  In a party centerpiece, he uses standard supermarket flowers to create a dramatic holiday floral display.  The instructions are easy to follow and not at all intimidating. Other Christmas decorating segments include The Art of Gift Wrap, Finishing Touches and Beaded Ornaments.

The Holiday Entertaining portion of this video starts with an executive chef demonstrating how to design an artisic buffet table.  He shares his secrets for casual home entertaining.  The Designing with Chocolate segment is a lot of fun.  In it a designer uses melted chocolate to dress up candles that smell of chocolate as they burn down.  She shows many chocolate ideas including a topiary made of scrumptious chocolate truffles.

The Table Top Design segments presents two spectacular...and I mean spectacular...holiday tablesettings.  Winter Wonderland is all in white, silver and crystal (""...the colors of snow..."")  The Nutcrackers Galore tablesetting centers around a collection of adorable holiday nutcrackers.  Floral designer Ron Morgan returns to create a magical party setting called ""Fire and Ice"" which includes a special effect - an underlit glass-top table that seems to glow from within.  Very dramatic! And amazingly easy to re-create at home.

In the final segment, we ""attend"" a Trim-a-Tree Party and learn the do's and dont's of hosting successful parties.  Everything from the Role of the Host to The Role of the Guest; from creating unique party invitations to creating magical party settings.

This holiday video offers a treasury of creative ideas for the holiday season.  The host is pleasant, the designers are talented and the ideas are creative.  More importantly, this video is very entertaining to watch.  I highly recommend it!",1131235200,5,3678,5.453097345132743
