5772891,5,B00D3UOE7O,"Carrie Underwood has pretty much set the standard for female country singers as far as live performances on television or in concert is concerned with this brand new DVD filmed for television on AXS last March at the Ontario Business Bank Arena in California.  It is easy to see from this concert , which is based on one single night performance and not based on editing multiple night dates as most singers try to do to avoid any weak or imperfect notes, why Carrie is not only considered the greatest country singer of her generation, but one of the greatest of all time as Brad Paisley has pointed out on numerous occasions.

This beautiful concert was filmed by Christian Lamb who has been Madonna's video concert director for several years.  For those of us who saw this concert when it was shown on a one time basis for the AXS cable channel you will be pleasantly surprised by the improvement in sound as well as visuals for this re-edit of the performance.  When a director shoots a live concert direct to air he is flying by the seat of his pants, but when he has several months to choose from 12 different camera angles and mix the sound properly you get an amazingly different concert as a previous reviewer has noted.

Carrie's concert director is Raj Kapoor who has done previous set designs for Celine Dion and Shania Twain for their respective Las vegas shows.  His state of the art use of giant moving video screens to form almost three dimensional backdrops for the background of the concert are breathtaking.

Carrie Performs 21 songs on this amazing concert for her Blown Away Tour which I had the pleasure of seeing live in Reno ,Nevada in October of 2012.  While no video tape can capture the true power and beauty of Carrie singing in person this dvd does a great job of capturing this singer at her artistic peak.

The Concert is listed in four separate acts and an amazing encore but the great thing about it is there are no interruptions during the concert and even when she disappears below stage for one of her five costume changes the musicians play on and she is back on stage in no time.

Ms. Underwood has never looked so beautiful as she steps out of what looks like Dorthy's House from the Wizard Of Oz and gives a powerful and spunky version of Good Girl, which is one of the 12 number one songs she does for this concert.  She does an amazing version of Wasted and immediately slows it down with a tender version of the I Told You So, written and first recorded by the great Randy Travis.  She finishes act one with one of her most haunting and atmospheric songs from her Blown Away album, Two Black Cadillacs.

Act two opens with a rousing version of Last Name followed by a tender version of Temporary Home, both songs of which she had a hand in co-writing.  This is followed by one of the highlights of this amazing concert, a poignant version of Jesus Take The Wheel that flows right into the vocally challenging and raw take of Carrie's version of How Great Thou Art, which includes an unedited take that Carrie adjusts so her voice won't crack either because her band is playing in too high a key or she knows her voice won't reach that staggering note that I've seen her reach on many occasions.  Any other  performer would have re-edited this moment to capture a perfect but fake take, but this shows Carrie's unwillingness to cheat or fix what was a beautiful yet less than perfect performance.  It reminds me of Adele's concert at Royal Albert Hall where she stops her band at the beginning of a song to note, ""that note was shit, lets try that one again.""

Act three includes an amazing ride over the audience on a moving platform that features All American Girl and a great party version of One Way Ticket among others.

Once back on stage in another amazing outfit for act four, Carrie opens this set with Leave Love Alone and closes with her signature 4 million dollar blockbuster Before He Cheats.

The Encore is truly the icing on the cake of an amazing evening that opens with Carrie sitting on a bed alone with just her voice and the opening piano notes of her tour de force version of I know You Won't.  Her voice builds and builds slipping into the most delicate  falsetto at the end of each verse before going for it full voiced on the last two takes.  If there is a better song or a better sung song performed live I have yet to hear it.  Carrie closes this spectacular concert with her Grammy winning title song Blown Away, sung with passion and authority while wind and tornado sweep in front of and behind her respectively.

It is no wonder that great singers like Pink and even Michael Jackson have praised Carrie Underwood as both a consummate singer and performer.  There is simply not another singer on the planet with a greater voice.",1376438400,14,4799,4.5
5772892,5,B00D3UOE7O,"Ok, I'm a Carrie Underwood fan so I will like this.  The DVD arrived today, popped it in the computer to get a quick preview, while a more detailed comparison to the live AXS TV broadcast on which the live concert portion is based will follow, my first impressions are that they have done a great job editing this.  I believe the camera angles and overall editing is much better (to be expected) and sound quality is better too.  For DVD, very sharp with no signs of artifacting in the many dark shadow areas.  They've done a good job at keeping the live feel but making this the best it could be.  Most concert DVD's I believe cherry pick best performances from a number of events, this is from one concert.  While Carrie has sung individual songs better than this particular concert depicts, the overall event is just top notch.

The ""Extras"" include Behind the Scenes, Image Gallery, and Music Videos.  I've only explored these a little, the Rehearsals show staging and other fun stuff, this will make for a fun evening checking it all out.  Lot's of extra interviews with Carrie and clips, etc.",1376352000,2,1098,4.589743589743589
5772893,5,B00D3UOE7O,Love the DVD!!! I got it since I was not able to make it to see her live on tour! Glad I got it! If your a Carrie Underwood fan its a must get!,1376352000,6,143,3.235294117647059
5772894,5,B00D3UOE7O,"I am really surprised that Carrie took this long to put out a Live Concert DVD because she is stunning, awesome & flawless & even more so when she's LIVE!!! Only a handful of Artists are gifted that away. She is THE best Voice in Country Music & I am ecstatic about this DVD. I hope she releases more live sets in the future! I'll be waiting to be ""Blown Away"" time & time again! <3",1376265600,9,382,4.0394736842105265
5772895,5,B00D3UOE7O,"I had a chance to see her live on this tour in Oklahoma City, OK and the one thing I have learned over the past year or so about concerts, is that country artists know how to 'bring it.'
Carrie Underwood brings her 'A' game to this fantastic tour. Her show rocks hard, literally and figuratively. This concert will appeal on all levels. You don't even have to be a hard core country fan to enjoy this either. Great songs, a string of hits, massive costume changes and hi-octane energy is what it's is all about. This is one of those great shows that you can enjoy with the entire family. The only thing that is missing from the set list is her fantastic performance of 'Sweet Emotion' by Aerosmith. I'm sure there was some kind of licensing issue which is why it's not included on this, but it doesn't take away from the overall experience.
Get ready to shatter every window, break every board and get 'Blown Away.'",1376179200,32,915,4.420118343195266

5772923,5,B00D3UOE7O,"Carrie Underwood delivers a powerful country pop concert performance. If you're familiar with Carrie and her music and you don't have this then do buy it. Your favorites are here (up to the Blown Away tour) as she just simply delivers the power vocals we've come to expect. She changes her wardrobe, features musicians playing with her and appears simply on stage with special effects that do not take away attention from her but rather fit right in. Her singing, the music, high quality video, the effects make this a powerful and dazzling high energy performance. There are also bonus extras including four music videos: Good Girl, Blown Away, Two Black Cadillacs and See You Again. Also an image gallery and a Behind The Scenes video featuring: The Rehearsals, The Wardrobe, The First Show, Show Build Time-Lapse and the fans.

5773030,5,B00D3UOE7O,"The title says it all, LITERALLY, 'cause, in my opinion, the beat of the music to her songs has more of a soft-to-mellow rock and roll beat to them.  Also, until I saw her in the movie, ""Soul Surfer"", I had never even heard of Carrie Underwood.  I love this concert DVD for many reasons.  The set-list, which is broken up into 4 different acts, as well as the fact that, when Carrie disappears below the stage after each act for one of her many costume changes, the band members, who play awesomely well, never stop playing.  Plus, I love the backdrops for each song, some of which are animated.  Also, during the 3rd act, I love how Carrie & her guitar players are on this platform that rises above the audience!  I also love the fact that, with the exception of ""Jesus, Take The Wheel"" in the 2nd act and ""See You Again"" in the 4th act, which get me very emotional, all of her songs that she performs puts me in a good mood.  I also love the special features.  So, in conclusion, I recommend this concert DVD to anyone who loves Carrie Underwood, like I do, or is in the mood for a great concert 'cause, believe me, it is TERRIFIC!!!",1383696000,,1135,4.271028037383178

5773033,4,B00D3UOE7O,"I would not normally have purchaseda DVD by an American Idol winner but Carrie Underwood was chosen to be the musical entertainment for an organization I belong to so I thought that I would check this out to get familiar with her music. After watching I have to admit that I was impressed.

The concert filmed in Souther Caliornia features twnty of Carrie's hits performed in front of a packed house. The vocals are strong thoughout and I found myself gaining more and more respect for the young singer. In a world of throw away pop starsCarrie stands out as the real deal.

The standard definition disc features the concer and several bonus features relating to the concert. Also included are four music videos from the tour. The only smallquibble with this release is that it does not seem to be available on Blu ray which is a shame because this is a really interesting show which would really shine in high definition.

Well recommended.",1383523200,,941,4.6909090909090905

5773036,5,B00D3UOE7O,"Was excited to see someone (even if its European made) released a Carrie Underwood concert. Was hoping they filmed  the Play On Tour and release that, but I gave up waiting. That was a much better stage production than the Blown Away tour. This video concert of the Blown Away tour is really amazing looking on DVD (where is the blu ray?) but the sound is lacking. It sounds tiny with no bass what so ever. I cranked up both my subwoofers and manipulated the surround sound to get it to sound decent. It should come off the disc with plenty of oomph for such a dynamic show. Interesting special features (behind the scenes and conceptual videos from Blown Away) and image gallery. The concert is 100 minutes and is packed with Carrie's great singing. I would prefer a more of variety, but it is to promote Blown Away album. The disc is split into four acts (wardrobe changes) plus encores. The video is 16:9 with only Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Too bad there is no DTS track to make it sound better. The disc is dual layered DVD-9,  region free, NTSC, made in Europe (wonder why it wasn't made in the states?). Just glad to get this magnificent performer on a concert DVD after all this time. Just wished the sound was better for today's sound systems. For ten bucks, who's complaining?",1382918400,,1284,4.506437768240343

It is a great DVD, but I kind of miss the down home sweet Country singer with a beautiful voice.  I get it though.....they want to keep selling music, they want to keep getting the trophies, and this is what the promoters/managers etc do to help her grow.

I'm not much into todays country, as I was more into the 90's country, like Leann Rimes, Martina McBride, Lila McCann, etc. So I only knew 2 tracks on this concert DVD when purchasing it. Being from Oklahoma also and following her on the ""Idol"" show is why I got Carrie's first album. When playing this DVD, I loved every track of it. Surprisingly, my favorites were from Carrie's ""Blown Away"" album. The whole concert on this DVD is excellent in picture quality, being in widescreen, and 5.1 surround.

5773097,5,B00D3UOE7O,"I have loved Carrie Underwood since the AI days and my love for her has only grown. I've seen her in 2 of her headlining tours, including the Blown Away Tour. The video quality is excellent and I love the close up shots as well as when the camera pans out to see the entire stage. Sometimes these tour DVDs edit the audio, but it doesn't appear that way in this one. She's THAT good live too!

My only disappointment is during ""Leave Love Alone"" she sang with Hunter Hayes, but he was not included in this DVD. Their dynamic was a highlight of the tour, but I still loved seeing Carrie singing it solo. I highly recommend if you are a fan!",1378771200,,639,4.195121951219512
5773098,5,B00D3UOE7O,"Carrie Underwood has raised the bar for country music, claiming that country can be hot and fresh and edgy and new, not just boring with hay, fields, but cool. Her voice is amazing as ever! I really enjoyed how she sang a lot of her songs from her previous albums, and a great bunch from ""Blown Away"". The wardrobe is so beautiful! Her dresses just add to the performance factor. As far as I know this her first recorded tour and it's a good thing they did!

If you're a Carrie Underwood there is no question about owning it! You must have it today, right now!
If you're a country or pop fan, it's really great for you too!",1378771200,,623,4.235294117647059

5773101,5,B00D3UOE7O,This dvd is the best I've seen. I love Carrie Underwood's music. She is one of the best in the country music industry along with Rascal Flatts. I am so glad you had it to offer to your customer's. Thank you for keeping the price down so we could afford to buy it. Thanks so much.,1378684800,,279,4.0
5773102,5,B00D3UOE7O,Carrie has one heck of a voice but she is not as talented as Taylor Swift. All Carrie has in her show is a screen with animation the whole time while Taylor on the other hand tells you the story behind each song SHE writes PLAYS and sings along with props to go with the song.  Carrie doesn't play an instrument but the video is worth buying and her show is worth going to see this powerful singer. If you are looking for an entertainment show this is not for you though.,1378512000,,471,4.119565217391305

5773111,5,B00D3UOE7O,"I loved the whole concert especially as I couldn't go see it myself.  She sang like it was an actual concert with costume changes and what the concert goer would see if at the concert.  You  also go to see the beginning and background of creating the tour, including the dress changes etc.

But my only concern is some of her high notes were not there.  Her extremely high note on ""All America Girl"", her high note in ""How Great Thou Art"", and high note in ""Jesus, Take the Wheel"".  It was like they taped the end of her 54 city run when her voice was so ready for a rest and it just couldn't reach those high notes anymore.",1377734400,,624,4.158333333333333

5773114,5,B00D3UOE7O,"Overall this is a wonderful DVD/Concert. If you're expecting the entertainment level to be as high as a Beyonce, Madonna, or Pink tour, then you will be greatly disappointed. It you expect a good solid show with awesome live music, fabulous outfits, wonderful theme/visuals, consistently passionate powerful vocals, and wholesome fun, then you'll be greatly pleased. I definitely know from being a longtime fan that Carrie has the potential to deliver a much more spectacular, more riveting, more dynamic concert, so i'm rooting for her to connect with the right entertainment agents who will totally challenge her as a vocalist, as a storyteller,  and as a entertainer. I'd recommend this DVD to Carrie Underwood fans only.",1377648000,,724,5.241379310344827

5773116,5,B00D3UOE7O,"Carrie Underwood and her team certainly excelled at making the Blown Away tour a reality. All the amazing videos,effects and lights combined with her vocals, it's pure magic! Her awesome band played throughout the entire concert and I loved every minute of it. Carrie knows how to keep a crowd enthralled, wish I could see it live but this DVD is just as good because you get to see Carrie singing upclose and with all it's aliveness you really feel like you are at the concert! No knitting performances from different concerts - this is one concert, no vocal fixing - you are there as it happens- it's definitely a superior concert DVD",1377216000,,636,4.6371681415929205

5773120,5,B00D3UOE7O,"It's no secret to Carrie Underwood fans that Carrie is a powerhouse vocalist! She's a diva, but a classy one, and the this is the only live concert I have on DVD where the lead singer's voice doesn't get lost in the noise. You could debate that all the other singers fell victims of bad acoustics or bad mixing, but I think Carrie Underwood just has a better voice than most. She also is one of the few singers that sound the same wether they're singing live or in the studio. How many times have you heard a singer live and left disappointed because their amazing sounding performance from the studio is only mediocre live? This is not the case with Carrie, what you see is what you get, and it's a breath of fresh hair. Besides her man-hater songs, which are money makers anyway, her songs are good and (shock and surprise) FUN! All this DVD does is make me want to see Carrie live all the more. It was not just a concert, but a show. Definitely worth the money!",1377043200,,964,4.302197802197802

I only been to one of her concerts in the past but if I ever get the chance to go again I am going not only because she can sing but because she interacts with all her fans not just the ones down front, she gets to fly above the ones in the back and they get to see her up close like the front row people. So this is a perfect DVD to own if you love Carrie Underwood, or even just like her music...",1376956800,,555,3.672268907563025

Saw the announcement of the DVD release and couldn't wait.  Advanced ordered through Amazon (great service!), arrived today, watched tonight and was absolutely BLOWN AWAY!  Outstanding DVD, excellent sound and video.  A must see on a big screen TV with your amp cranked up.  Definitely worth every penny.  What a concert that must have been to see live.",1376697600,5,511,5.011904761904762
5773127,2,B00D3UOE7O,"I could not, in good conscience, recommend this concert DVD to anyone.

Carrie Underwood is excellent and looks great.  But the sound system on which this concert was recorded is terrible. There is constant echo and reverberation, for whatever reason. And beyond that, Carrie's microphone seemed to be on too low a volume to overcome the band behind her, so that, though many of Carrie's songs, you cannot really hear Carrie's singing, as well as you would like. Admittedly, this may be pretty accurate to how the concert sounded to the audience in attendance. But that audience had the live experience to compensate for whatever sound deficiencies there might have been.

Those of us who are buying a concert DVD deserve to have something a little more professionally recorded than this DVD was. I don't know the ""ins and outs"" of recording live CDs and DVDs from concert venues. But I suspect that there must be some sort of direct feed into the recording equipment, order to avoid this very problem.

I have seen a lot of live concerts--rock, folk, jazz, country. And I have bought even more concert DVDs and CDs. I would regrettably have to say that this was one of the worst sound produced concert DVDs that I have ever heard.",1376697600,3,1231,4.738317757009346
5773128,5,B00D3UOE7O,"I saw Carrie 3 times, 3 different cities on her Blown Away tour. I'm SO HAPPY this DVD came out so I can re-live it!! She puts on a GREAT show, she includes the fans when she rides the platform above the stage, beach balls everywhere and her voice is impeccable. HOW that girl sings sitting down is beyond me. She belts out I Know You Won't after almost 90 minutes and sounds as if she just started the show.  Carrie is the epitome of an American Idol! LOVED IT! LOVE HER!",1376524800,9,472,4.130434782608695
