2065229,5,B00027JYKI,"Great collection of clips from the best segments.  From funny to laugh out loud craziness.  You should get this if you are a big fan of Graham Norton's shows.  You won't be dissapointed.  Great clips of CHER, Sophia Loren and many other great stars.  They should put out a second volume of this ""Best of ...."" series of Graham.  Great laughs!!",1208736000,2,343,4.540983606557377
2065230,5,B00027JYKI,"if i could ever survive on ONE DVD for the rest of my life, it would have to be this one!

Graham Norton tells it like it is, and gets his celebrity guests to do the same!

YOU MUST BUY!",1205193600,3,186,3.625
2065231,5,B00027JYKI,"So Graham Norton and the Graham Norton Experience are incredibly entertaining late night talk shows where the topics are completely absurd, the sexual references abundant, and the humor is nonstop.

  He engages his audience in asking questions about their personal lives, finds interesting characters to call, and has the most random ideas tossed out which leave us shaking our heads saying I cant believe he is doing this. Some examples of his humor include showing a can of cock soup to Sophia Lauren, calling up a sex addict named ""Rocket man"" with Elton John, putting a classified ad in a magazine called ""Holes"", and getting pillows that looked like a set of breasts for Dolly Parton.

 Mind you this show is not sleazy as Howard Stern or Jerry Springer are. Its just plain fun.

 Norton finds some of the most incredible people out there who in themselved are hilarious such as a nude skiier, a man whose website is based on balloon fetishes, and the lovely Pam who can play the recorder in the most interesting of places.

  I really love the range of celebrities that he has on the shows too which include Chris Rock, Ricky Lake, Dan Ackroyd, Jacqueline Bisset, Shirley McClaine, Pam Anderson, Dustin Hoffman, Elton John, John Goldberg, and a lot of musical talents. Since this in not a regular talk show, these celebs seem so relaxed, and are having such a good time, that they start relating bizarre moments or off the wall experiences they have had.

 This may not be for those who have children because the conversation is sexually charged but its all good fun. Graham Norton and his sidekick Miss Betty (an ever present audience member)are naturally likeable and good humored. Please enjoy this set or catch it on Comedy Central or BBC.",1132876800,4,1750,4.777408637873754
2065232,5,B00027JYKI,"So Graham Norton is so funny I start laughing at his outfits. His guests are good sports and the audience is a riot. I wish they would do a DVD of entire shows, I'd buy them all.",1122595200,2,178,3.8378378378378377
2065233,5,B00027JYKI,"Just to let all you Americans, who haven't seen the DVD, know that it is absolutely fabulous.  As the main review states, it may be a little confusion as it jumps from clip to clip, but it's carefully edited so you get all the jokes.  One small thing though.  The BBC had nothing to do with the making of this show.  This show would never have been allowed on the BBC.  This show was made and produced by Channel 4, where the more risque of shows are broadcast.  If you like this you should also check out his earlier DVD complimation, however this may be deleted already.

Have fun and enjoy.  For American's I recommend a bottle of valium to go with it.  As this is not for the pearl wearing masses of ""middle America"" ... this is actually a real life homo on TV and he's filthy!  Not some squeky clean straight guy playing a lovable and adorable American gay stereotype!",1113177600,4,873,4.333333333333333
2065234,5,B00027JYKI,I normally don't like this kind of humor but this DVD is so flippin hilarious I actually got a headache from laughing so hard. I don't think I stopped laughing for more than 30 second the entire show!! MUST SEE!,1107993600,13,211,4.3
2065235,5,B00027JYKI,This is one of the best dvd's ever. It is on the funny level of the BBC's COUPLING or the US's Seinfeld.,1104278400,10,104,3.772727272727273
2065236,2,B00027JYKI,Norton is basically a witless person but he raises giggles among the immature with his display of sex toys and x-rated internet sites on the BBC. That is his whole act. Adolescent Howard Stern type of humor.,1102377600,3,207,4.621621621621622
2065237,5,B00027JYKI,"Graham Norton has been a star for several years now in England and most of western Europe.

 His show is not intended to have any specific agenda besides pure fun. For those of you who have not seen any of his British shows, but have got to see His new Comedy central show be aware that this DVD is sort of the Directors cut or uncensored version of what you will see on American TV.

 In England most people don't care about the ""F"" and ""S"" words so be prepared to hear a good dose of both. Graham Norton has been able to capture broad British audience.

 Openly Gay Graham Norton says that he has plenty of straight men in England come to him and admit that they love his show and watch it together with their girlfriends or wifes.

 This DVD is a selection of his funniest shows with mostly American celebrities to help sell better here in the U.S.",1091577600,11,851,4.24223602484472

2065243,5,B00027JYKI,"We laughed SO hard watching these older shows!  British humor can be taken so much further than American, so there was a bit of a shock factor.but a very entertaining and side-splitting couple of hours of clips was so worth it!  We want more!",1389139200,,242,4.4772727272727275
2065244,2,B00027JYKI,"Love the current Graham Norton shows, so thought we would get this for earlier years ... much raunchier than expected!  Didn't enjoy as much as the current shows.",1387238400,,162,4.785714285714286
2065245,1,B00027JYKI,"I know his tv show is ""colorful"" and slightly naughty but the DVD was pure fifth. After watching about !5 minutes of it o threw it in the trash, where it definitely belongs and cancelled my request for tickets to see the show in person with my grown children  when we go to London next year. What a waste of good money!",1382486400,,319,4.145161290322581
2065246,5,B00027JYKI,I really liked this and wish you could obtain all seasons (I believe he calls it series) not just highlights.  His format of a talk show allows interactions between all on the couch and him which can mean some very lively talks.  I don't feel like any one person on the couch is better than the other and really like the British Comedians.  I enjoy the reruns I can get on BBCAmerica but wish I could get on DVD.  DVR only holds so much.,1372291200,,437,4.166666666666667

2065248,5,B00027JYKI,I love watching Graham Norton. He's hilarious! I watch reruns of his show on satilite TV. The clips on this DVD kept me laughing.,1366761600,,129,4.416666666666667
2065249,5,B00027JYKI,"The picture was clear, the content hilarious. Graham Norton, always funny, did not disappoint. Graham is articulate, mesmerizing, and always fully involves his guests.",1358726400,,167,6.0

2065251,3,B00027JYKI,"I would love to have all 10 seasons, at least available for download unedited.  This best of is great but it's from 2004,.... he's still on in 2012. We need more More MORE!",1348099200,,172,4.212121212121212
2065252,3,B00027JYKI,"Everything was good.  However would like to suggest that you include the DVD Region ( e.g 1- US , 4 - Aust ) in DVD Description / Comments.. as this DVD would not play in Australia.",1337472000,,181,4.027777777777778
2065253,5,B00027JYKI,"We have been following Grham Norton for years-from ther early days with Father Ted and now with the Gramham Norton Show on BBC 1.
We had missed the 'So Graham Norton "" series for some strange reason and were delighted to find that the DVD existed.  This is terrific-funny-exciting-what a chat show should be.",1326844800,,308,4.703703703703703
2065254,5,B00027JYKI,"They have to come out with the complete series! OMG!!! I was laughing so hard, that I almost lost my breathe! Most of the prank phone calls were great (eventhough they might be considered sophomoric)but still...I can't imagine ANY American comic successfully doing this show. You HAVE to get this! Definetly worth the time and money.",1295395200,,333,4.964285714285714
2065255,3,B00027JYKI,"I LOVE the Graham Norton shows, and watch the current one every week.  So when I read the 2-starred rating that said that all he does is juvenile x-rated humor for an immature audience I figured that person just wasn't used to his humor, that he or she was exaggerating and probably hadn't watched the whole thing.  Well, if I only had this one DVD to go by, I wouldn't like Graham Norton either.  It only focused on the sex stuff.  I'm no prude (no, really I'm not), but his show works because it balances out the ""naughty"" stuff with the clever.  He IS a great comedian.  This DVD just doesn't demonstrate his well-rounded comic ability.",1252022400,9,639,4.4655172413793105
2065256,5,B00027JYKI,".....not in one sitting because my stomach hurt so much from laughing. Not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. But so - roll around ""I cannot BELIEVE they just said/did that"" - funny! I wish I could find more DVDs of Graham Norton! Loved it!",1241913600,2,252,4.270833333333333
2065257,5,B00027JYKI,"This is the only tape of Graham Norton available in the U.S. If there is another, please let me know.

This is a compilation of hilarious clips. Celebrities participate in Graham brand of practicle jokes, audience members divulges outrageous incidents from their own lives, and Graham's great sense of humor are a treat.

I wish there were more Graham in the U.S.",1217462400,2,363,4.838709677419355

8023228,5,B00027JYKI,The Best Of So Graham Norton was released in 2004. Plenty of fun to be had with Graham and his celebrity guests like Joan Collins. If you enjoy raunchy humor this is the DVD for you. Fans of Graham Norton will like this the most.,1490659200,,229,4.111111111111111
8023229,1,B00027JYKI,The content wasn't what I thought! This was not a result of Amazon . It was Graham Norton. Very offensive. I will not be purchasing anymore of his material!,1456617600,,156,4.413793103448276
8023230,5,B00027JYKI,"Graham Norton is by far the best showman in Britain. His shows are always different with playful humor, original performance and visual comfort. Mr. Norton always manages to parry in the conversation. He is able to be witty and make jokes. I can call him a Man - the fireworks. Why? Yes, because with him is never boring. He always knows how to give a charge of good mood and vivacity of spirit. He became a legend in his lifetime!",1444521600,,431,4.4
8023231,3,B00027JYKI,"This dvd/artist was recommended by a friend w/ diff tastes from my own, and I'm not a big fan...the main prob was the show is clips, w/o prelims, etc, just goes from one clip to the next, so it's hard to watch.  I think the Johnny Carson and SNL videos that have the whole shows (even w/ the old commercials) are the best; I don't like ""The Best of....."" type dvd's.
OTOH, if you're a fan of this guy, you'll prob like the dvd.",1431561600,,427,4.083333333333333
8023232,5,B00027JYKI,"If you're a new fan of Graham Norton, you will see how the older shows were done. I've had BBC America for many years now and my first exposure to Graham Norton were these shows. His format now is much more enjoyable, as he spends more time chatting and making his guests laugh, along with the audience. But this DVD is a nice walk down memory lane for those of us who have enjoyed Mr. Norton for many, many years now.",1429574400,,418,4.172839506172839
