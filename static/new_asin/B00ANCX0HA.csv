No matter your party beliefs, after one of these famous and entertaining debates, you'd learn a lot.  That is not true today.  People don't learn anything in todays debates.",1398211200,,286,4.916666666666667
8554631,2,B00ANCX0HA,"This Firing Line Debate was not what I hoped it would be. First, WFB Jr takes almost a backseat in the discussions. The apporach to the debates in the '90s is to have 4 versus 4 with equal time to debate and represent their cases. Very balanced, very democratic. Because there are 4 on 4, each person has less time to talk and thoroughly get into discussion about topics. As a result, people are speaking hurriedly and often punctuate their points by giving minispeeches either while answering and sometimes while questioning their opponents. Because the opposition has less time to address what's being said, they find themselves forced to interrupt. Instead of a strong civil discussion, you have something which is much more contemporary (and undesirable to many) which is a lot of loud crosstalking instead of listening and responding. This is a universal criticism of this debate format for all of the debates I've seen from this period.

As for this particular debate, the then contemporary points made about this issue are dated. You have references to the Branch Davidians and the Ayatollah in Iran as cited examples of an undesirable interpretations of religion being potentially supported if the ""Wall of Separation"" were lowered and the other being an extreme example of a state ruling based on a specific religion. Neither issue is at all relevant today.

Also, this debate references the old voluntary prayer in school debate. We've reached the point now where a child who chooses to voluntarily, and visibly engage in Christian prayer in public school may face suspension or worse.

Another problem is that this debate predates 9/11 which caused a push for Muslim tolerance in the West. This seems to be done at the expense of many who argue strongest for the separation of church and state. Now, there seems to be favoritism for one form of religion to be practiced and represented in public places while others remain a fevered target based on the separation argument.

Last problem is that today, the Wall of Separation between Church and State was lowered for the left's benefit when it comes to religious health institutions being mandated by law to offer contraception even though it is contrary to their religious beliefs. This went into effect on Aug. 1 2012 but this seems to have been pulled back in January 2013 to degree. I am stuck wondering how any of the participators in this debate would respond regarding this contemporary issue in the context of the discussion

This is debate is terribly dated and unfortunately, does not do much to further understanding of this issue in a present day context. I will not say this about other Firing Line debates which either remain relevant in terms of there discussion (the ones on Domestic and Economic Policy) or in strictly historical terms (The Ratification of the Panama Canal Treaties Debate in '78)",1365292800,2,2875,4.931818181818182
