8736510,5,B016IVJ6DG,"Art Riggs brings us another excellent dvd set, this time showing how to incorporate the deep tissue techniques from his first set into a flowing full body session. This is the first time I've seen clinical, therapeutic techniques brought together with feel good, integrative, full body work. Art teaches us in this series how we can be effective as massage therapists without compromising the relaxing, blissful fluidity a full body session brings.

This set has been incredibly valuable in my practice, helping me plan my sessions better and leaving my clients feeling more complete and whole.

I've been fortunate enough to attend Art Riggs' workshops in person and he is by far my favorite instructor. He has an amazing way of igniting excitement and passion in bodywork. His personable and down to earth approach shows us we can be clinically effective without being sterile and cold. He truly is a pioneer in the bodywork field.

Not only is the set chock full of great techniques and concepts but it looks BEAUTIFUL and is easy to watch. Get it, you won't regret it!!!!",1461110400,3,1075,4.895604395604396

8736512,5,B016IVJ6DG,"I have been working in a spa-type setting for over 15 years. I just started watching these videos, little by little every time I get a chance, especially before I go to work. They have absolutely changed the way that I work. Don't get me wrong, my clients loved my massage. But now, I look at the body in a completely different way, testing the tissue as I go along, and addressing issues that I feel under my hands. Art Riggs is a gentle and engaging teacher. These videos have opened up my work and it is so much the better for it.

I cannot recommend Art Riggs' videos highly enough.",1449014400,3,586,4.2792792792792795
8736513,5,B016IVJ6DG,"This is the best educational massage DVD I have ever encountered! Great job Art! If you want to be successful in your practice and have clients follow you and book with you months ahead, buy this DVD, this price worth all knowledge, theory, techniques he demonstrates! This DVD is equally fantastic as his first DVD series! You will enjoy it immensely!",1446595200,3,352,4.786885245901639
