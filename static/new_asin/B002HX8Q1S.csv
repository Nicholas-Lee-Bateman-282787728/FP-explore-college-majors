3935161,4,B002HX8Q1S,"I bought this at Target and think it's an excellent DVD. I like the belt that comes with it, which is basically why I bought it. You can select walking 1 or 2 miles, a classic walk or fast walk --- plus there is a neat 5 minute express walk.

Leslie instructs you one on one. She's her usually lively self. The music is not great but it helps you keep the right beat so it's alright. We're doing it to lose weight and stay healthy. So not-so-great music is no big deal.

The one thing I don't like about the video is you can't get a warm-up or cool-down by clicking on a menu button. Seems to me that if you opt to do the 1 mile, you should be able to easily find the cool down. I realize you can do your own cool down. But it would be nice if it were quickly available to you on the DVD.

Using the weight belt is a great way to burn extra calories and get in shape. The instructions that come with the belt are not great but it's not that tough to get it together.

All in all, this is a nice package and a good workout. For those of us who hate aerobics, nothing beats Leslie Sansone. Highly recommended.

UPDATE: I lost two pounds the first week of using this DVD three times. This was without a change in diet. Losing weight is extremely hard for me. So, I can't say enough good about this DVD. Oh, and I only did the 1 mile walks.

3935162,5,B002HX8Q1S,I love this dvd you have an option to go slow or fast or both and depending on the day it can be either. I have about everything she has done but I swear she just keeps getting better.,1268697600,22,184,3.7435897435897436
3935163,5,B002HX8Q1S,The weighted belt really brings up the intensity of the walk/workout.  I even use it while working out to other videos.,1268611200,7,119,4.666666666666667
3935164,5,B002HX8Q1S,"This is one of 4 kits that I own, still waiting for the other 2 to arrive in the mail. This DVD features 2-2 Mile Walks and an adjustable Weighted Belt (approx 2 lbs). The First of the 2 Miles offers a Classic Walk done at a Moderate pace. This is good for those days when you want to get up and moving, feeling good about what you've done, but don't want to have a high intensity or a high-effort workout. The second of the 2 workouts is a 2 Mile Fast Walk that picks up the pace and intensity. I would rate the 2nd of the 2 walks Intermediate, low advanced. Both walks allow your chapter options to pick just 1 of the miles, which ever you choose. There is however no option to pick both miles back-to-back, you have to go back to the menu option and start the 2nd workout. I did that last night and in about 60 minutes I got a great, sweaty, 4 miles done in 60 minutes. She has many workouts, 4 Mile DVDs, that are done in about 50 minutes, but this is a great way to get started on the 4 Milers without the higher intensity that those offer.

The weight belt is soft and comfortable. I wear it on my hips and can hardly tell it's there. However at the end of the workout when you take it off, you certainly can tell you were wearing it! You feel the weight difference immediately. It's hard to believe that 2 lbs would have that much impact, but it does. I have 2 of these belts and am looking forward to trying the walks with both belts on. I may also add my soft hang weights to the belts; much cheaper than buying a 10 lbs weighted vest.

It's a great kit and the belt is a safe way to increase the weight in a workout without risking injury to the joints. The belt is also great to use with other workouts or with outdoor walking. It's really one of the most versitile ""boosters"" or workout equipment that I have ever owned or used.

Both walks are approx 28-30 minutes in length.",1260921600,125,1888,4.097297297297297

3935170,5,B002HX8Q1S,I would highly recommend purchasing this product.  The purchase is worth it by itself just considering the walking belt.  I use this belt for every Leslie Sansone DVD that I do and it definitely makes a difference.  The DVDs that are included are pretty good too.  Leslie is by herself on these DVDs (no other walking friends).  Most of the time I do the 3 mile DVDs but on days when there is not enough time I like to do this fast walking 2 mile DVD.  I liked this product so much that I recently purchased one for a friend of mine.  Do not hesitate to purchase - you will love it!!!,1417046400,,584,4.160714285714286

3935174,3,B002HX8Q1S,"I love alllll of Leslie's tapes.  I have a good amount of them and love it most when she's working out with a group.  Her tapes are soo good and motivational for whatever mood, physical or emotional  you may be experiencing.  Some mornings, I'm just too tired, barely able to get out the bed.  I'll do a quick one mile for those days.  Other days, when I'm geared up and ready to go, I'll do a 2 or 3 mile tape that's a lil more energetic.  Or, I'll do a longer tape when I have more time or more energy.  Her tapes are all so good for mixing things up and her group workouts I especially love because she keeps things going and makes you feel like you're there with her.  If you can walk, kick your feet up and side step a bit,  you can do her tapes, they are that easy!  And, with my haphazard way of exercising, I've lost over 20 pounds since I started back in January. Her tapes have kept me going more than any other diet exercise program I've used.",1412553600,2,954,4.075268817204301

3935180,5,B002HX8Q1S,"I have MANY of Leslie's DVD's. I enjoy the variety she incorporates in her different DVD's, that's why I have so many. I love to walk, it's my favorite form of exercise. This DVD is not really anything new except that she does incorporate the weighted belt, which is a nice addition, and the belt can be used with any of her other DVD's as well. The first 2 miles are pretty basic, slower paced without any fancy additions. So if you have done many of her DVD's before this will most likely not be anything new. However, the reason I bought it is because I have recently gone through some major physical challenges that have limited me to what I am able to do. So the slower, easier pace of this DVD has really been a blessing. This DVD, along with all of Leslie's DVD's, are made so that you can do as much or as little as you want, and you are able to go at your own pace. I also enjoy Leslie's encouraging attitude, and upbeat spirit.",1409961600,,937,4.211111111111111

Her emotions are not as lively as her other DVD's I have been a fan of Leslie Sansone for over twenty years and I admit this one if for a low-impact only day. I do anywhere from 5 to 7 miles a day mostly intervals and even the ""Fast Pace"" portion of this DVD is slow for me. I will keep the belt and use it towards one of her other DVD's I understand this DVD is from 2009, so Leslie cardio DVD's have come a long way.

I like the fact that through the years, she has added weights, bands and now this belt.  I don't like to do the same DVD every day, so I like to switch off and this one is another great walk off!.  My only issue was with the belt, Even though it appeared to be simple to adjust, it did not stay in place, and I finally had to cut off some of the extra band so it would not fall off.  With that adjustment, it seems to be stationery, but I wish it was a better quality as I would gladly have paid a little more for that added bonus.",1403395200,,655,3.873134328358209

Leslie has kept up with the times and changed her routines around by adding more cardio and weights, but I sure miss her group vids.

3935210,5,B002HX8Q1S,"This is one I use at least once a week in rotation with some other Leslie Sansone workouts, step aerobic DVDs, and kickboxing DVD workouts. However, instead of using the belt provided I prefer my 12lb weighted vest. The belt seemed to loosen up throughout the workout and the weights tried to slip out the ends but if you sew up the ends of the cloth it will prevent the weights from coming out. It's a pretty easy fix and I'm thinking of starting to wear the weight belt along with the vest and see if I can burn off a few extra calories.

I use the 1st workout for days when I'm a bit tired or sore as it is not as intense as the 2nd. The 2nd workout still gets my heart pumping every time. You can modify all Leslie's workouts by adding bigger arm movements, wearing ankle or wrist weights through the whole routine, or wearing a weighted vest like I do.

Using these DVD's I've been able to drop 25 pounds over the last 9 months. My weight loss continues. I have 15 more pounds to go to reach my weight goal. Even when I get to my weight goal I'll continue using her DVD's to maintain my weight. She gives the best workouts as far as I'm concerned.

3935215,5,B002HX8Q1S,"This is an older Sansone DVD that I just purchased (via that well-known auction site). I like it a lot. No other exercisers, just Leslie--which I greatly prefer to her ""group"" DVDs, which are way too perky for my tastes. The weight belt fits fine. Just remember not to grab it by the end when it's unfastened, or the whole thing will come apart and you'll have to rethread the webbing through the two padded weight sections (D'oh!). Re-fasten the clip after you've removed the belt to prevent this from happening.

Both of the two-mile workouts (one is faster than the other) are great, and really get your heart pumping. You can choose to walk only one mile if you wish. I use one- or two-pound hand weights to add even a bit more challenge.

But what I really like is a 5-minute ""energy boost walk"" that's included on the DVD. I work from home and sit in front of a computer for most of the day. The 5-minute walk works as a quick break to stretch my arms, legs, and back every hour or so. Very helpful!

I've tried many video workouts over the years, and Sansone's are definitely the best. No trendy baloney, just straightforward, easy-to-follow moves that work the entire body. She has perfect form, is friendly and motivating without being particularly annoying (except in some of those dreaded group workouts!), and stresses good posture and safety. Her workouts are now the only ones I bother purchasing, and I use one of them at least once a day. By doing this, plus using the weight machines at the YMCA three times a week and changing my diet (lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and no more processed foods whatsoever), I've lost 25 pounds in the past 2.5 months.

I thought I would like it this way less, but I love it just the same.  She seems more laid back, and makes the workouts very enjoyable.  I also like the music better in this one than the ""Love Boat"" type music in the other videos I have of hers.

I also like the choices you have for your workouts. You have a 2 mile walk broken down into 4 options.  First, you choose if you want to do a casual walk or a fast-pace walk.  Then, from that selection you have a choice to do just the 1 mile or the complete 2 mile.  Of course I do the complete 2 mile, mostly fast-pace (I love it).

One minor drawback is that I could not get the belt adjusted properly.  The instructions have very limited information, so it is very loose on me unless I wear a waist trimmer.  But Overall, this workout package is worth it, you will get a great workout.",1370304000,2,961,4.058510638297872

3935224,5,B002HX8Q1S,"Actually, it is two great workouts.  The disc has two workouts of two miles each.  The second is a little faster.  I like the belt, except that both ends of the holder are open, and the weight can slip when working out hard.  A safety pin is an easy work around for this problem,but Leslie should improve the product.",1364515200,,317,4.322033898305085

The belt gets twisted and the ends come out of the little weight sleeves, but it's not bad, and I love the Fast Walk workout using the belt.

3935253,5,B002HX8Q1S,"This was my first purchase of a Leslie Sansone video. I had tried some of her workouts from the library and wanted to get one.

The 2 pound weighted belt was intriguing to me. I really like it. It is very comfortable, and you don't even feel that you are wearing it after awhile. I also liked that she was alone in the DVD- sometimes it can get distracting with so many other exercisers in the background.

 Leslie offers choices for your workout: 2 Classic Walk options (1 mile and 2 mile) and 2 Fast Walk options (1 and 2 mile). You could also  mix and match and do 3 miles or 4 miles. She is a great motivator and instructor, constantly encouraging and re-assuring.

Overall, this is a fabulous indoor walking workout. And with this package including the belt, you won't pay much more than one of her other videos.

I will say, too, that the first package I received had a defective belt (one of the buckles would not stay closed). This was no problem, as Amazon took the product back, no questions asked, and quickly sent a replacement, which worked perfectly. This was the first time I had to return something through Amazon, and I was so pleased at how hassle-free it was to return. UPS came right to my door to pick up the defective item and I did not have to pay return shipping charges.",1352246400,,1295,4.375
3935254,4,B002HX8Q1S,"I purchased this a couple of years ago at Target for half the price, I don't know how much it is at other places, but I've seen it cheaper. The 2 separate miles are awesome workouts. The classic walk is fast, but not nearly as fast as the other 2 mile fast walk. The weight belt is a great addition and when you take it off at the end you really do feel the difference. My only complaint is that after several months of use, one of the buckles snapped. I can still wear the belt, I just have to be careful and not have it real tight. Otherwise this is a really great workout, thanks Leslie!!",1328054400,4,591,4.05982905982906
3935255,3,B002HX8Q1S,I bought an identical product from Walmart for $19.99. Leslie Sansone's exercise program is excellent by itself. It's just sold here at a double price.,1327881600,5,151,5.08
3935276,4,B002HX8Q1S,"I have about 9 of Leslie's DVDs (as well as a few VHS tapes kicking around), and have been using them about 5 days a week.  This set comes with a DVD and 2 lb. belt, which I have used with several of her other workouts.  In all honesty, I'm not a huge fan of the actual DVD because the workouts aren't long enough.  I prefer a 3 mile workout, and this has 2 2-miles, plus a bonus track.  If you wanted to, you could do the two workouts back to back, but I just prefer having a designated 3-mile rather than piecing two shorter workouts together.  But the workout belt is a great addition to other workouts in the series, particularly those that don't include weights, belts, or other apparati.  I also like the fact that I can work with extra weight without having to carry anything in my hands.  I am now in the market for a 5-pound workout belt (not quite ready yet for 10, and certainly not for 20), but will keep using the 2 as a booster during workouts.",1315353600,7,958,4.173913043478261
3935277,5,B002HX8Q1S,"After you watch the video for the first time, turn off Leslie's chirpy little voice, put on some classic rock, and walk. No tricky steps, not too fast, not too long. You can do it with or without the weight belt. I'll be honest--I haven't lost an ounce but I feel better when I walk. Not much space is needed. The walk takes about half an hour but I like the five-minute power walk for days when there just aren't enough half hours in the day.",1311984000,3,443,4.162790697674419
3935278,5,B002HX8Q1S,I like this DVD but don't really feel the difference the belt is making.  Maybe because it is so comfortable I am not able to tell.  I love Leslie and own many of her videos and DVD's. Get bored with one pop in another!!,1306281600,,220,3.977272727272727
3935279,5,B002HX8Q1S,"This is the best exercise DVD by Leslie Sansone bar none.
If you have a lower back problem like I do.  Do not put the weighted
belt around your hips. Tried that and my back was hurting for a
few days afterwards.  Your best bet is to put it around your waist.
I wear it a little loose at first, and then after I get use to
wearing the weighted belt I tighten it up. You know your back
better then anybody else. Judge for yourself.
 I have done all the programs on this
DVD and I love them all! Even the 5 minute boost is great for
when you are on the run and only have a few minutes for a
quick walk.
She does all the exercises by herself. Which is better
then ten women in the video all taking at once.
You will not be unhappy with this DVD with Leslie Sansone.
It is AWESOME!!!!!",1303344000,,780,3.9240506329113924
3935280,4,B002HX8Q1S,"I like this workout; I use it as a 4-miler without the belt, as the belt really made my back hurt. I can take the belt apart to use it for ankle weights, so it is not wasted. This DVD doesn't have the option of doing both workouts together, so you have to keep walking at the end of either until you can bring up the main menu again, which really is no big deal.

Leslie is by herself in this workout and you have a choice of a 2-mile classic workout or a 2-mile fast workout. They are both good workouts.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Off-Even-More-Weight-DVD-Set-with-Belt/dp/B002HX8Q1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone Walk Off Even More Weight DVD Set with Belt</a>",1303257600,,743,5.460869565217391

3935282,5,B002HX8Q1S,"I love Leslie Sansone's videos.  The workout makes you sweat, which is good.  The belt doesn't feel heavy, but does the trick.  For larger sizes (37"") like me, the belt scraps are hard to adjust, but you work with it.  It should fit well for smaller waists.  Look to build up sweat.  Good job, Leslie.",1279497600,4,301,4.381818181818182
3935283,5,B002HX8Q1S,"Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Off Even More Weight"" has two two-mile walks that you do using a weight belt, which comes with the DVD.  The first walk is a Classic Walk - you move at a 15 minute per mile pace (4 mph).  The second walk is a Fast Walk - you move at a 12 minute per mile pace (5 mph).  Each workout gives you the option of doing just the first mile, just the second mile, or the full 2 miles.  Also included on the DVD is a five-minute energy boost walk.

Hosted by just Leslie with no other walkers, the Classic Walk features all the Leslie Sansone standards (warm-up, cool down and the four basic steps: walk in place, sidesteps, kicks and knee lifts).  Since it is a two-mile walk she also adds a few more intense movements (especially in the second mile), including tap outs that turn to lunches and single knee lifts, double knee lifts, and four knee lifts.  About seven minutes into the walk you put on the weight belt which you wear for the rest of the program, including the cool down. While the belt doesn't feel all that heavy while wearing it you can definitely feel it working especially after the workout is over and you take it off.

The Fast Walk (again hosted just by Leslie) is an intense workout - you wear the weight belt from the very start until cool down.  The moves are faster and more intense - for example, instead of walking back and forth you almost jog instead of walk.  In addition to the four basic steps, you do things like walk, walk, walk, tap; power kicks (almost like hopping and kicking); tap outs that turn to lunches; single knee lifts, double knee lifts, and four knee lifts; heel down; and mini-squats.  Leslie also adds a few things not usually done in her two-mile workouts -- notably a movement where you open up your feet and shift your weight from side to side (a lot of fun) and grapevines in place of double sidesteps - all of this helps add to the intensity of the workout.

The Bonus Energy Boost Walk is a quick five minute fast walk.  There is no warm up or cool down and you don't use the weight belt but it uses these typical Leslie moves: walk in place, sidesteps, kicks, knee lifts, walk forward and back, double knee lifts.  Leslie also gives quick energy tips such as get plenty of sleep, make sure you eat breakfast, take a multivitamin etc.

""Walk Off Even More Weight"" is one of my favorite Leslie Sansone exercise DVDs.  While I found both routines to be beneficial I tend to use the Fast Walk the most because it is more intense and I feel like I've gotten a really good workout after using it.  The weight belt adds just the right extra boost to make the workout feel even more intense.  The workout may not be the best for beginners, but is more for those who are used to Leslie's workout (especially since she's not always good at telling you what move to do next, instead she simply moves into the next step).  While I like the belt it takes a little getting used to when taking it on and off - especially taking it off during the Fast Walk when your hands may be sweaty.  Also, the set Leslie uses can be a bit distracting - it is mostly mirrors and windows and you can see the cameraman in the mirrors.

""Walk Off Even More Weight"" has two good two-mile walks that make for an excellent workout.",1274745600,51,3269,4.317512274959084

I tried this one first last night, doing the Classic Walk and the Bonus Energy Boosting Walk.  I felt great after doing them, I was sweaty but I never felt like I couldn't keep up and best of all the time flew by!  I couldn't believe I was done when the end came.  The belt was comfortable and you don't really notice the difference when you are wearing it, but once you take it off you feel lighter!
