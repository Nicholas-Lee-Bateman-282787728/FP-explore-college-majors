Like the other one,there's only one match worth watching and that's the Bret Hart/British Bulldog-Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart/Owen Hart tag team match. The rest: Forget it. I give this tape a 1 out of 10.",1324598400,,331,4.724137931034483

Matches are rated out of 5 stars but keep in mind they may not be in order but I will try to get it simple
1). Diesel vs. Lex Luger (2.5/5) Entertaining enough but more of a power match-up and that isn't my favorite cup of tea. The match was solid with no obvious bad spots. Both men are stiff and overrated, even at this time.
2). Yokozuna vs. 123 Kid (3/5) A good big man, small man match but it wasn't the best because Yokozuna didn't really mend with 123 Kid.
3). Doink vs. Jeff Jarret (1.5/5) Boring, Boring, Boring!
4). Bret Hart and British Bulldog vs. Anvil Neidhart and Owen Hart (4/5) What you would expect from these guys. They all did one hell of a job in carrying this match and made it very entertaining to watch. All 4 men are great at tag matches and this match was done acceptionally well in booking the ending to this match. Alot of false finishes. Great!
5). Diesel and Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon and 123 Kid (3.5/5) A good match but wasn't as good as the last match. Still entertaining!
A great addition to my big collection of WWF, WWE, ECW, WCW, IWA Mid-South, ROH, CZW, XPW and NWA Wildside tapes. I would recommend buying it from a local store because it certainly brings back great memories for me. When stars looked like stars and were marketed because they were big... Maybe it isn't all great memories but seeing The Harts in action is always a plus!",1047340800,6,1509,4.3736654804270465
