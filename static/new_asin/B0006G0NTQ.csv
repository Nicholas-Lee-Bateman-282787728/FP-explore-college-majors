[...] added a listing for Beast Machines: Transformers to their site, but it took us a bit of time to look into the release and sort out the correct and incorrect information. Warner Bros isn't the company that's releasing it, Rhino Home Video is. The 4 disc set will contain all 26 episodes of the show (2 seasons worth). The set will retail for $59.95 US, and will be in stores on November 15.

[...] I went to the anchorbay entertainment site they no longer carry it, then I read at one of the transformer sites that rhino was putting out a box set which was suppose to be out ever since august 2004 so I went to their site of course they don't have it so I wrote an e-mail to ask what happened of course I'm still waiting on a reply (Fat chance!!!) Maybe they like to keep us in suspense or maybe through some miracle somebody will have all 26 episodes on amazon....guess I'll have to keep my fingers and toes crossed.......

8041458,5,B0006G0NTQ,"I enjoyed watching it, but it is not the complete series. I hope they will make part 2 very soon.

Ok what you get on it are 5 episodes

1. The Reformatting

2. Master of the house

3. Fires of the past

4. Mercenary Pursuits

5. Forbidden Fruit

I thought for the price I was getting the entire series, but I was mistaken as a Transformers fan I wanted it for my collection, so I did not mind. I wish they had placed on the info page the details of what you get when you buy it. Cause it did not say part one I assumed it was the entire series but it was not.

When you buy it the case says volume one on the back.

Also their was no special features which I was hoping for. But it you are a Transformers fan who wants to collect the entire collection it is worth it. Plus I enjoyed the fact that Black Arachnia still was looking for her long lost love. I was glad that part was still included! Enjoy!",1115596800,18,902,3.9392265193370166
8041459,1,B0006G0NTQ,"After hearing about the ""continuation"" of the Beast Wars series, I was overwhelmed with joy.  But after viewing this waste of time and effort, I am sad to report that all that was once sacred with the original Beast Wars has been turned to slag.  ""Transformation?""  What the eff?  No guns?  Energy blasts from Optimus's uni-nipple and plant/tree things?  I have vomited more interesting things than this durge.  After it was revelaed that the true intention of Cybertron was to harvest organic life, I took an organic dump.  My dump kind of resembled the plotline from Beast Machines and/or Joanie loves Chachi...lumpy and full of gelatinous nuts.  What sort of demographic were the writers aiming for?  Tree-hugging transforming hippies who want nothing more than to ""become?""  There are several other bad things about this show that I can't even recall.  I had more fun getting bridgework done.  I'm not talking about the Space Bridge Gen 1 fans.  Hardy har har.  If only the virus that killed most of the Cybertronians in Beast Machines could have leaked into the writer's room, we could have all been saved.  I blame the Fox Kids network and their religious propaganda for promoting such crap.  If I could have rated this stink nugget in the negatives, I would have.  I can't even get a zero on this thing.  It should be a negative billion cajillion.  I push that everyone find this review helpful.

On a side note, I do like the soundtrack.",1112227200,20,1445,4.769230769230769
8041460,5,B0006G0NTQ,"The victorious Maximals of ""Beast Wars"" have returned home to Cybertron; unfortunately, *not* to a hero's welcome. Instead, Megatron escapes, Rhinox disappears, and it looks like the whole planet is their enemy. But Optimus Primal has discovered a secret deep within the planet's core that may lead to their salvation. Watch this awesome series to learn what it truly means to be ""Transformed"".",1106092800,7,394,5.26984126984127
