4067761,5,B0034JIP60,"This gives a very good, thorough, balanced look at religion around the world. It creates an understanding of what others believe, and why they believe it. This was very well done, and beautifully presented. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone with an open mind, and open heart.",1273449600,11,283,5.042553191489362
4067762,4,B0034JIP60,"Peter Rodger's odyssey took him to 23 countries where he asked people from all walks of life, ""What is God?""  His thoughtful and provocative documentary is built around one of the fundamental questions we humans ask ourselves - even if we dismiss the notion of anything beyond the here and now (whatever that is).

Beautifully photographed and edited, the smorgasbord of images and words and music is a thoughtful meditation around the greater idea of transcendence itself.  It must be acknowledged that we exist not of our own doing.  The why and the how are ALL speculation, no matter how strongly you think you know the origins of life and consciousness.
Some of us even hear a voice that we assume is God's.

In 2003, the leader of the free world told the BBC that he raided Iraq because God told him to.
In some primal way, we seem to be wired to embrace the mystery - and perhaps that is the essence that makes faith itself the biggest miracle of all.
I liked the mostly short comments by the disparate members of our human family - the dismissive and the devout.

A bonus disc includes an additional three hours of full-length interviews with Hugh Jackman, Ringo Starr, HRH Princess Michael of Kent, Sir Bob Geldof, David Copperfield and others.
Fighting about God's identity, name and nature is destroying our world.  I liked the aboriginal elder, who says, ""When Christian missionaries came to tell us about God, they broke all the Ten Commandments.""

I was heartened to see and hear Ringo Starr still insist that, finally, it really is all about love.  One is reminded that the essence of all the great religions, including the message of Jesus, is: ""Love your neighbor.""  That idea could still change the world.  Perhaps God waits, bound by the rules of free will, for His kingdom to be perceived and made real.  Whether you believe or not.",1270944000,31,1851,4.696594427244582
4067763,3,B0034JIP60,"If you want general information as well as a non-proselytizing overview, this is a good documentary.  A few celebrities are interviewed and asked about their religious experiences.  Since Islam has been in the forefront of the news for the past 20+ years, more than one ""expert"" is interviewed: one a true scholar, the other a bigot.  The message seems to be that most people of different faiths can co-exist peacefully with love and tolerance.  If a more ""in-depth"" approach is needed, then different sources should be consulted.",1361836800,,530,5.057471264367816
4067764,4,B0034JIP60,"I really loved seeing a wide range of cultures and faiths answering ""What is God?""

Of course the celebrities were also very interesting. It was great watching all the extended interviews.

I found David Coperfield's response particularly thoughtful as he is a professional illusionist.",1341360000,4,286,5.4772727272727275
4067765,5,B0034JIP60,"This movie is rich in thought and visual images.  Whatever the viewer's opinion regarding God or gods, the scenes of widely varied worship pratices and the words of spiritual/religious leaders and their people are so vivid they must hold our attention.  I recommend this movie, but not for children due to some gory scenes.",1318204800,4,323,4.962962962962963

Sometimes it seems as if there are as many concepts of God as there are people on the planet.  And if there really is just one true God, why do people have such a widely varied and often contradictory view of Him/Her/It?

Curious about this phenomenon, filmmaker Peter Rodger set out on a tour of the world to try to find some answers to some age-old questions:  does God exist, and, if he does, what is He like, why does He allow suffering, and why do people often hate and kill one another in His name?  Rodger's journey takes him to places as widely disparate as Texas, New Orleans, India, Australia, Bali, Tibet, Kenya, Mexico, Guatemala, Japan, the politically-charged Middle East, and even what appears to be a Jihadist hideout or training camp.  The result is ""Oh My God,"" an interesting, though less-than-penetrating, documentary that provides a panoramic view of religion and faith-based belief systems across the planet.

Rodger interviews religious figures, charity workers, celebrities - Hugh Jackman, David Copperfield, Baz Luhrman, Seal, Ringo Starr, among them - and just plain folk from all walks of life and belief systems.  He speaks with Catholics, Protestants, fundamentalist Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Native Americans, Australian aborigines, Druids, agnostics, atheists - you name it, he covers pretty much the entire spectrum of faiths (and non-faiths) that exist in the world today (and a few, like the Mayans,' that long ago faded into the fog of history).

One of the things Rodger discovers is that religion is often just a form of tribalism wherein different groups fight against one another for power and gain - which may account for why humans seem obsessed with the ""my god can beat up your god"" line of thinking.  Religion as Big Business, religion as an opiate for the masses, religion as a means of confronting the reality of our own mortality - all these get played out in the course of the movie.  And Rodger is not afraid to call BS on someone when he feels it's justified - i.e., a young priest at the Vatican justifying the Church's opulent lifestyle in a world where thousands of people die of starvation every day, a Muslim cleric claiming all non Muslims are going to hell but not being able to find a single verse in the Koran to buttress his point.

Rodger gets no real answers to his original questions, of course, though he does seem to favor Eastern and indigenous-type views of God and religion over more formalized Western ones.  But, then, do we really except to get any answers to questions that have perplexed and eluded the human race from time immemorial?

Of course we don`t and, thus, ""Oh My God"" is primarily of interest as an anthropological study of Man's myriad ways of coping with the Great Unknown - and that will just have to suffice for the time being.",1297296000,12,2843,4.811088295687885

4067768,5,B0034JIP60,A real thinker.  There are a lot of good questions being asked in this movie.  Should be watched more than once to really 'get it'.,1289088000,4,131,4.2
4067769,2,B0034JIP60,"A guy with a camera goes from place to place getting quotes from people about divinity and religion. There are some translations into English. There are images of thought provoking faces, interesting rituals and eye catching vistas.

There are a lot of comments about ""maybe this"" and ""maybe that"". There are also numerous declarations about what is the absolute truth.

Excluding the appeal to emotion, this is a documentary that doesn't do as good a job in 98 minutes as a Wikipedia article I would spend 30 minutes reading.",1279756800,5,526,4.898876404494382

8388371,3,B0034JIP60,"Plenty of world wide eye candy, sweeping music, celebrity wisdom and religious authorities and practitioners orchestrated by Mr. Elliot.  It seems to me on balance the viewpoint is that the concept of God is interesting, but certainly not necessary, and possibly an impediment for modern people.
To be fair, the scene that captured the spirit of the film best was one that has a tribesman directly addressing his interviewer.  The scene closes when he somewhat pointedly asks 'Any more questions?'
Mr. Elliot included his son Roger in the end credit acknowledgements.  God was conspicuously absent from the manifesto Roger released prior to his 'day of revenge' rampage in which he killed four male students, two female students and himself.",1402012800,,741,5.2100840336134455

8388373,5,B0034JIP60,"THIS IS A GOOD JOB...but it is just the tip of the knowledge that can be gained out there on the subject of god if anyone else wants to build a career on this--going around the world and asking people what is god and how is god and where is god and why do we need god so definitely much?

This product has another dvd that is just as important or even more important than the first.  We listen to Westerners talk about god.  We get to listen to them.  Copperfield, an illusionist said something thought-provoking.  He said something like this: ""I'm an illutionist, a professional--I know some tricks...so sometimes I think that if I had been born thousands of years ago I could start my own cult and get my own dogma written and I would like be the maker of god.""  Well, I said when Copperfield made that inference--You could do that today!  When it comes to that kind of participation in the making of a god, in the ''setting-in'' of a god; well, that has always been a choice and it will always be a choice.  So...that added little to the discussion the rest of the people in the project were doing.  The rest of the people were astonished by their feelings for god and how great they felt about it and was glad they had the 'sense' to garner the chance to fall in love with god.  They talked about how god makes them feel.

Now then...there is an English aristocrat in this movie and he speaks honestly about his feelings about god and he is somewhat intellectual in his expressions using cuss words all the way through. (Considering his gray hair that was a bit immature, but okay, that's who he is.)  But what was so stunning about his discussion is that he squawked about the ""legends"" and ""myths"" and ""stories"" and ""parables"" about god that people have created over thousands and thousands of years without realizing that when people talk about god they are talking about something they definitely FEEL and all the stories and other arts they produce about this ""feeling"" they have is their way of bringing that feeling outside of them to match up with others who can appreciate it--THUS, THUS, THUS, the magical manifestation of god.

WELL THEN...if that be it folks then what is this high-faluttin' aristocrat doing when he curses his way through his discussion?  Do you think he's telling the world how god feels to him inside?  Ugh...how many folks want to join in his communion with his version of god?  (BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE THIS PHENONMENAL PART IN OUR ANATOMY--so it's all about what you do with it that matters to you and to others who either want to ignore you and your cussing mouth or join you in your warm, adoring mouth and loving spirit.--Margaret Opine",1394064000,,2674,4.528066528066528
8388374,2,B0034JIP60,"So... I bought this having watched Hugh Jackman's inspirational ENTIRE interview on youtube from the dvd. I thought, my gosh, this is GREAT, having an in depth conversation with people about their beliefs/ideas about God, seeing as I am trying to become more spiritually enlightened. So I thought the DVD would be like that. NOT AT ALL. The DVD is pretty much a mix of athiests and believers (I liked that aspect, because I believe every opinion should be shown) but its really just a quick succession, like 10 seconds from each person and then some footage from poverty stricken areas with ""inspirational music"" tied into it. It reminded me a lot of those late night evangelists commercials that show poverty stricken areas with the bad vo's. Back to this DVD though, I would SKIP and instead youtube ""Hugh Jackman's Oh my God interview"" What he has to say is BY FAR more profound than anything listed on the dvd, so if you are seeking spiritually enlightenment or just to see what other people have to say about their beliefs, YOUTUBE it instead and save the 20 bucks. Hope this helps!",1389916800,4,1087,4.696335078534031
