7204487,2,B00XZF398M,"I watch quite a few independent films, and have to say, Will to Love fell into the rank of ""bad"" I do not recommend it--the acting was very ho-hum and the story line boring to an astounding degree. I can't believe I stuck with it to finish it. If you like this genre, try Think Like a Man. Similar themes, different plot line, and sizzling dialogue and creative turns.",1469923200,,368,4.3478260869565215

7204509,4,B00XZF398M,This is a nice family friendly film about dating. The woman in the photo on right hand side is so beautiful. I hope to see more of her on film. This is a nice film for couples to watch on date night. Men and women have to be honest when they are dating. When a couple are honest and openly confess their feelings they will be able to have a great relationship. Houston is charming as usual.

7204514,4,B00XZF398M,It was kinda  cheesy. But it was cute! I am huge fan of Marques Houston and anything he  is in I pretty much like despite how bad or good the project is.,1453075200,,153,3.75
7204515,4,B00XZF398M,"First, it's nice to see a black romantic-comedy where even the scantily clad women didn't have everything hanging out all over the place; where they show that there are young, black, professionals with their head on straight; and where it didn't look like the entire budget came out of someone's weekly paycheck. It wasn't Broadway level acting, but it was nicely done and it was cute. I enjoyed the relationship between Rachel & Jamal, I just hated when Jamal was back on the fence about what to do AFTER he started to have feelings for her. Some things that weren't clear to me: what exactly did Monica (the sister) do in order to necessitate, as well as make it possible to pay, an assistant? What ""dirt"" did the assistant find in Jamal's garage (or that's where he appeared to be)? How did Monica get cameras in Jamal's office? As for the actress who played her, she did a good job of making me not like her at all.

I wasn't fond of Jamal's best friend, Danny, at all. He was way too childish, and sometimes Jamal was a bit too easily swayed by him. That was the only thing I didn't like about Jamal. I really liked Valarie Pettiford as the mom, and it was good to see Gary Sturgis playing a good guy (remember him as the bad guy in ""Daddy's Little Girls""?) Overall, this was a cute movie that had its sweet moments and its funny ones. **Possible Kleenex moment: the scene with Jamal & his mom in the dressing room just before the wedding. :'(",1451001600,3,1448,4.402985074626866

7204517,5,B00XZF398M,A very beautiful romantic love story without vulgar language and nudity.  They should make more romance movies like this.  A movie that shows true love cannot be bought with a price and that there are real people (men and women) in the world that choose love over money.  Love in the end does prevail.  There is great chemistry between Marques Houston (Jamal) and Keisha Night Pulliam (Rachel).  His mother Valerie Pettiford (Avyon) is an example of a mother's unconditional love for her child who in the end guides Jamal to make the right decision even if it means losing all of his material positions and place in his grandfather's company for which in the end he inherits it all.,1449878400,4,682,4.697478991596639
7204518,5,B00XZF398M,"It would be difficult to refute the undisputable fact that Draya Michelle is the most sexy and lovely female on the face of this planet. Her smooth, well-sculptured, ""mulata"" features, places her in an exceptional class of exquisite fine art and beauty. She makes this movie worth owning. The acting was not that bad from the other actors. As for Draya, what can I say; she rocks!",1449705600,,380,4.686567164179104

8717153,5,B00XZF398M,"It was one of the best movies you could ever wanna watch, especially if you are a romantic man or woman. A lot of things you can learn from it and apply it towards your own relationship or marriage and the actors were very very great. He put you win a sense of as if it was you playing the Mail character and having to make certain decisions that you knew that would affect you for the rest of your life when it came down to be in between two women, one who cared about you and the other one who  was just there for the money. Ask yourself that question, what if that was the knee what I have to choose between someone who I know isn't real and one who is real? But overall it was a very good movie and I look to buy mini mini more because you guys carry the movies that I look for and in about another month or two I saw by possibly up to a dozen movies again this year or more but will buy at least  about a dozen more movies over the next 45 days from you guys.
