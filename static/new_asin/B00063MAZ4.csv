Humor is not understood by everyone, there are many jokes that mostly only Cubans would understand.",1394496000,,296,4.285714285714286
8037903,4,B00063MAZ4,"For those of you who speak Spanish you might find the English subtitles a little bothersome when they interfere with the animated charater's faces.  The DVD menu does not allow you to take them off and they are not set to be all the way down at the bottom of the screen.  Other than that, it is a very enjoyable piece of work from director Juan Padron.",1121472000,3,352,4.2388059701492535
8037904,1,B00063MAZ4,"Warning! This DVD has a Spanish sound track only - no English. English subtitles are hard coded into the picture, they cannot be turned off, and appear - severely blurred - almost in the center of the screen. Obviously, the DVD has been transferred from poor quality, analog video tape. Extreme color smearing at all edges, very low color saturation, lack of sharpness, and weak contrast ruin this film completely, giving it a bleak and dreary look. My old (German dubbed) VHS tape, recorded from TV, is vastly superior! Don't waste money on this DVD. I should add that the movie, if properly presented, would be wonderful.",1121040000,5,623,4.831775700934579
8037905,5,B00063MAZ4,"I saw tthis fantastic cartoon movie many years ago. It is a fabulous tale of the vampire-rat mafia in Havana. They run an underground solarium, very profitable, as the vampires cannot go to the beach..

Enter the old scientist, who has invented something that makes the vampires stand the real sun - VAMPISOL! The mafia wants to stop this product from being commercialized, as it will ruin their business.

Lean back and enjoy, it is hilarious!",1097280000,7,444,4.828947368421052
