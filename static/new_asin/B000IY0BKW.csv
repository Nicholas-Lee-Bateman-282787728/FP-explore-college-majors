8147674,1,B000IY0BKW,"I bought this DVD because the product had not been reviewed on Amazon by anyone at all at the time of purchase. I was hoping the DVD would grow on me purely on merit, besides I didn't want to be swayed by an opinion. You could say I knew beforehand I was either going to reap positive points from my investment or nothing at all. This DVD finally arrived yesterday; I saw it and it went from my DVD player into the dumpster. I was really disappointed and I'd tell you why shortly.

Dr. Perry, the producer/director of the series was studying to be a Catholic Priest before quitting the seminary because he had a 'call' to help people in their sex lives. That said, the reasons for my disappointment:

First, the video is wrongly titled. A better title suggestion (based on content) instead of 'Sex Skills' will be 'How to pleasure her: A Sex Memoir by Real Men'. Quite frankly, even this is a diplomatic title because there is hardly any instruction about the what, why and how. Only a few scattered comments by the performers, and a short irrelevant intro by Dr. Perry. Irrelevant because at some point he says, and ""[...] here's one of the hottest scenes in the video"" with the silhouette of a couple having sex in his sex basket in the background. Then they proceed to show you a handful of couples having sex, mostly the old fashioned way. Duh, you see better and definitely more intimate sex on R-rated movies (without a show of the genital area of course). Yeah, a note of caution, they do show `everything'!

Another thing, the couples were quite removed which only serves to prove that this is nothing but some cheap pornography. I don't know if you can fake it to your partner, but you can't fake pleasure to an audience. I'd say the distinction between pornography and media meant for instruction is the intimacy, however gray the distinction is.

The quality of the picture is not so great. It's not so bad that you can't view the content but it kept reminding me of some movies I'd seen from the early 90's. The hairdo on the actors is a total giveaway. Copyright on the DVD is 2005, given the available technology for video production; I know the video could have been better.

If the video quality is forgivable, a weak attempt at pornography, with some not-very-subtle ads thrown in and showcased as instructional is not. The most blatant is the `Perry-Scope'; an awkward shaped, clear color glass tube to be inserted into the woman to help find and view her g-spot. In fact I kept waiting for the lady's partner to go ""Bam, there it is! You got yeast"" I actually felt sorry for the guy. After locating her g-spot, she pleasures herself with a vibrator, and she had this display of orgasm (the only person who seemed to actually have one). Then her partner decides to use his finger (`huh, uh can't stand to be outdone by some vibrating plastic'). Speaking as someone who happens to have carpal tunnel, this is why I felt sorry for him. He works his hand so hard and at some point had to support it with the other. You can literarily see his veins pop out of his skin like the rubber squeeze before getting an I-V. I don't know what sort of selfish pleasure that is when the other person is in pain.

We see the basket to pleasure yourself to delirium, we see prolonged close-up shots of the oils used in the massage (more like: `make sure you buy this brand or you in for some whooping on your behind') and the story continues. Seriously, I won't recommend, don't wait your time on this one.",1226275200,4,3507,4.4890282131661445
