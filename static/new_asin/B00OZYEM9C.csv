6780553,4,B00OZYEM9C,"I thought The Pirates was a great movie! It's full of fun characters, over-the-top-action/antics, high comedy, little bit of drama and romance as well as an emotional hook in the way of the whales... so a tiny bit of Star Trek the Voyage Home thrown in...
I'm currently on a Pirate kick and my fav show is Black Sails which I highly recommend - it's the Game of Thrones of Pirate stories, gritty, realistic, adventurous with complex characters... I've also been re-watching Cutthroat Island, Treasure Island, Treasure Planet and of course all four Pirates of the Caribbean and just rented The Pirates which I found to be similar yet original.
I don't do dubbing and prefer the original language track with the original actors voices so opt for subtitles and everything comes across clear and true in this movie. I understand all of the characters perfectly and enjoyed the story, crazy fun stunts and beautiful cinematography.
There's a budding romance between the male and female lead reminiscent of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann too, although Black Sails is on a whole different level (adult) this film is right in line with the Disney Pirates and as long as the kids don't mind foreign languages they can enjoy this just as much. Same with Cutthroat Island as well.... I really liked all the little touches from the Pirate that gets seasick to the monk, to the shark scene, to the Robin Hood-like Bandits not being successful in the woods... There seems to be a lot of genre's cleverly mixed together in this in my opinion and it's all welcomed - It was wonderful as is I just keep thinking it's too bad this isn't a trilogy even more like Pirates of the Caribbean because they could have expanded on everything and done so much with it....
I'll be getting the BD of The Pirates soon as I can. It's awesome!",1433721600,8,1812,4.683385579937304
6780554,4,B00OZYEM9C,This Movie is fun.,1433289600,,18,3.75
6780555,3,B00OZYEM9C,"Set in the 14th century Korea, early days of the Joseon Dynasty, The Pirates follows the story of pirates and bandits trying to hunt down a big whale that has swallowed a royal seal. The South Korean action adventure film suffers from an uneven script, relying too much on special effects, but those effects are decent, if not outstanding, and the film itself is a pretty entertaining romp.

Son Ye-jin plays Yeo-wol, a female captain of pirates with deadly sword fighting skills. Kim Nam-gil plays Sa-jung, a warrior-turned-bandit leader, who comes to know about the swallowed seal that is absolutely necessary for the new nation.

Yeo-wol and Sa-jung. together with their crew, embark on a journey to find the lost item  even though Sa-jungs men, mostly mountain bandits, do not know how to sail a ship, let alone what a whale looks like. The Pirates is fairly enjoyable with decent fighting sequences with some slapstick comedy thrown in, but it could have been much better with more focus on the rivalry between the two characters.

The Pirates is an above average entry among the many pirate-themed films, and is a perfect way to kill your time and have some fun.",1433289600,,1168,4.825

6780564,4,B00OZYEM9C,"The Pirates was a fun film, worthy of a viewing.

The film takes place during the Joseon Dynasty, early 1300s. At this time, Korea is beholding to the Ming Emperor of China, who has sent his royal seal to the Korean monarch with a demand of 500 slave girls and 200 eunuchs. The only problem is, the seal was swallowed by a giant humpback whale, while it was traveling back to Korea.

Thus the need for someone to recover the seal comes to light. The Korean monarch wants to make sure he has proof that he has the approval of the Ming Emperor. The situation leads to a group of pirates and bandits coming together to hunt the whale down. The Korean navy also enlists the help of one of their own commanders, who happens to have a grudge ridden history with the bandit leader. Add to that a second group of pirates, who have a grudge against Son Ye-jin, a female pirate captain, who previously took over her ship from Captain Soma, and you have a big complicated power struggle at sea. The film takes us through lots of high seas adventure with humor, drama, as well as some nice special effects before things resolve themselves between the four groups.

I have to say, I did like this film. It was very light-hearted and definitely added a lot of comic relief. Particularly with the bandits, who save one, knew nothing about the sea or hunting whales. In fact, at one point, they tried to harpoon a great white shark, thinking they'd cornered a whale. The whole scene was so ridiculous, you couldn't help but laugh. And they never seemed to listen to the one bandit groupie with sea experience.

 In any case, there's enough action and drama to keep things moving along at an entertaining pace. There might even be a little too much drama in some places, with on overuse of exposition. But if you've been watching Korean Dramas for awhile, it won't bother you that much, because you'll realize the film was blending styles together in order to make a blockbuster film, not just a violent action flick.

The acting is OK, but nobody had an opportunity to put on the performance of their career here. They all did their best to tell an entertaining story. The plot of chasing down a whale is only part of the drama. The other part involves the grudges between the groups, which adds more dimension to the overall story. It was a good choice.

The tech aspects include the film in Korean only with English subtitles. That didn't bother me, but it was a rather long film, so you'll want to make sure you view it when you're wide awake. It's hard to keep on reading and watching the action if you feel the least bit tired. I had to watch it in two parts, due to being a little drowsy the first time.

In the end I gave the film a 4. It's definitely different from Hollywood Swashbuckling films and it did it all with humor, drama, and decent special effects. It's not the best Korean film I've ever seen, but it was entertaining and its one you could watch with younger family members. Not quite Pirates of the Caribbean, but Worth a watch if you're even slightly interested in it. It might even be a fresh break from Hollywood.",1429401600,10,3122,4.455341506129598
6780565,5,B00OZYEM9C,"I think this is the first Korean movie I've seen and the 2 hours went by really quickly. Great combination of swashbuckling fun, humor, and drama. Great CG too.

6780580,5,B00OZYEM9C,The film is in the vein of what our Hollywood pirate films of the 40's and 50's were like.  There is much derring do and tongue in cheek not to mention over the top humor in this adventure about a lady pirate and her troubles with the opposing men folk.  This swashbuckler sure does and is a fast two and some hours long.  There is no wonder why this film was one of the top grossers back in the East.,1424390400,5,401,3.9875

6780582,4,B00OZYEM9C,"This is not the greatest movie ever made.  There are a few flaws - some of the attempts at humor fall flat, mainly because the comic scenes sometimes go on too long.  The CGI effects are distracting.  I wanted more swordplay and better action choreography.  However, this movie is still superior to anything that has come out of Hollywood in recent years.  It's not stupid.  Orlando Bloom isn't in it, and that alone almost makes it worth watching.  The best thing about it, though, is Ye-jin Son plays the greatest film pirate ever.  She is fantastic as the captain of the pirate ship.  I hope she plays this character again and again.",1423785600,,636,4.607142857142857

6780584,2,B00OZYEM9C,"I really looked forward in watching this movie because I was a great fan of Kim Nam Gil.
This movie is not a true pirate movie.  It  has to much ""slapjack"" comedy and try's to be like the Johnny Depp's Pirates movies series.
Also, having the movie scenes with the Mother whale and the baby were to raw and disgusting for under aged  people to watch..",1422489600,4,350,4.2727272727272725
6780585,3,B00OZYEM9C,"Find the whale that swallowed the royal seal, you get the reward - even if you're not sure what a whale looks like. That's the basic premise of The Pirates, one of a few recent Korean period films that have garnered much attention. As a large scale action flick, it's amusing to see the collision of the four different groups that are intertwined in many ways. As an actual film of merit, not so much. But what'd you expect from a movie with such a ridiculous plot?

Despite the lack of any real special features, I was surprised to find such a recent foreign blockbuster being priced at $12 on Blu Ray (at the time of this review). Even more surprising is the fact that both the DVD and Digital SD versions of The Pirates are currently priced higher at $15 and $14, respectively. Not exactly why that is, but if you've ever had the need to own a copy of this film in high definition, now would probably be a good time! It's also worth noting that the action in The Pirates is really the only type of content parents should be aware of.

Factually, this ocean adventure is historically set in the Joseon Dynasty. Fictionally, a whale decides to gobble up a very important item that commemorates the kingdom. This prompts a hunt for the whale, and with that hunt follows a battle between pirates and bandits, all vying for the same treasure. It's a 2+ hour film, and when there's not some good showcasing of a supposed $13 million budget or an elaborate slapstick sequence onscreen, there's constant humor, drama, and, unfortunately, exposition. Eventually, though, the mix of those different elements do work in the movie's favor when the stakes get a little more complicated, and when the whales (yes, plural) begin to take center stage.

There's not much to say about the performances of the cast, since there weren't any opportunities for an adventure film of this nature to showcase quality acting in the first place. K-drama fans will immediately notice the odd casting of Kim Nam-Gil and his Shark co-star Son Ye-jin, both of whom are not normally in action films. Those unfamiliar with their work will obviously not be bothered by it, but it's just too bad neither of them try to do more than the status quo for their characters. Yes, Son Ye-jin plays a female pirate, but it's disappointing she doesn't give more depth beyond that now-typical feminine ""twist"". If anything, the highlights are mainly from our large CGI whale and Yoo Hae-jin, who has absolute fun with his role as the seasick pirate/bandit/comic relief.

It's a fun movie, plain and simple. There are certainly issues that keep it from being a perfect one, whether it's the slow setup, cliched characters, or even the predictability of it all (there's a male hero and a female heroine who are initially at each other's throats. And it's a Korean drama. You figure what happens at the end.). But seeing how the director Lee Seok-hoon clearly realizes what he's working with here, entertainment is ultimately the only purpose it serves. Fortunately, it serves that purpose well. This is not a thinking man's drama or an intricate character study - this is simply entertainment in the form of an adventure film. It's useless trying to dissuade anyone from at least giving The Pirates a try, as it's quite a likable diversion with the right mindset going in. Of course, if you love pirate movies, then there's no need to hesitate with this one!",1422316800,12,3414,4.71356783919598
8685911,4,B00OZYEM9C,"This is a fun and enjoyable movie, somewhat similar of course to a certain Disney franchise, but it does its own thing and does it well enough that said franchise may have taken inspirations from it for sequels. It is in all subtitles for the digital version but if you don't mind that and want a action adventure this is a good view.",1533859200,,334,4.317460317460317

8685920,5,B00OZYEM9C,"I started watching this on a flight (had it downloaded to iPad) and had about 30 minutes left when we landed. Went to finish it the next day and it had been removed from the streaming service I was using!! I had to finish it so I'm happy to see it available here. Giving it 5 stars based on what I've already seen of it; it is the most enjoyable movie I've seen in a while, just a lot of fun. Great visually, lots of action but no gore, and really funny in parts. Well worth seeing if you're thinking about it.",1506038400,,510,4.009803921568627
