3115721,5,B0013KU93E,"I watched this video with family at Christmas.  If you like astronomy and science at all you will want to see this.  If you liked What the Bleep Do We Know and/or The Secret and/or are interested in learning about the infinities of the universe and are searching for some answers/encouragement, I would recommend this.  Louie is very engaging and energetic, sometimes a bit too much but you can't help but love and appreciate his verve.  Without his passion, this dvd would not be as appealing. Since it is not currently available here, the main reason I'm writing is to encourage you to watch/buy it and tell you that if you go to the Passion 2007 website at 268generation.com and search under videos for ""How Great is Our God"" by Louie Giglio, you can get it for 15 dollars.  If you are a thinker/seeker/questioner/curious person, you should really enjoy this. Soar! o8E",1204502400,5,872,4.7105263157894735

3115821,3,B0013KU93E,"While the guy is a good speaker, the overall message is pretty much ""how great is our universe.""  He would be a great speaker for a science course, talking about the cosmos and how enormous it is as a testament to God's greatness.  While the info is interesting, and possibly good info for someone who is on the fence about whether or not they believe in God, for the practicing, believing Christian, it feels almost like universe worship. Yes, he does talk about the God who created it, but the true focus seems to be awe of the stars.

I bought the three video set, given the great reviews, and wish I could have watched them on Amazon instead.  It's not something I would buy.  This particular video, toward the end, talks about how God loves you and if you're feeling down, how a God this powerful is able to help.  That is the gem of this video and why I gave it three stars.

Try YouTube and his name before you buy!",1410480000,,922,4.294797687861272

3115832,4,B0013KU93E,An amazing talk series by Pastor Louie Giglio regarding just how small we really are in comparison to the Universe.

He also explains the miracle of our bodies as they grow from two cells to adulthood.  He puts it all into easy to understand language spiced with humor, stories, graphics and sincere enthusiasm.  For those reasons alone, everyone should watch this DVD whether you believe in creationism or evolution.  Worst case, you might come away with a new perspective of how enormous the universe is.  Best case, you might just come away with a new perspective of a God actually existing who is greater than you have ever imagined.",1363910400,2,678,4.760683760683761

Almost everyone that sees it wants a copy.  I still offer to show it to whoever will let me show it to them.  I can't say too much about this presentation.
As of 3 30 16, I have purchased 150 DVD s.  I have four in my possession, this is the most revealing video of our time.  It is only 42 minutes long, but seems like an hour or two.  Every person in the world should view this video.  Most people know a little about the first section, but practically nothing about the last half.  If I were Louie Giglio, I would put it out as a free education video so everyone could view it.
By the way, I've watched the video over fifty times, now, and I will look at it again.  Jesse",1353110400,,837,3.9520958083832336

I've had this for sometime and still play it when we have fellowship or just to show how great is our God and LORD Jesus Christ. I recommend that you watch 'Indescribable' first, which is also very very good. I've watched it several times and still like watching it.",1340928000,,433,4.3580246913580245

3115962,5,B0013KU93E,"If you've ever seen Louie Giglio  Live, on YouTube or on DVD you know that it inspires.  All Christians should see How Great Is Our God to just be encouraged about how BIG our GOD is. Also non-Christian will find it inspiring as a evangelistic tool as he goes into a lot of science to prove that there is no doubt that God created all things.  Amazing! I've seen it several times and still shout and weep at how Great GOD's LOVE is for me. Leaves you feeling and knowing that GOD is greater than we can possibly begin to understand. HE IS big enough for any problem we have. Give this as a gift. It will change lives and be a blessing!",1327881600,6,635,4.146341463414634
3115963,5,B0013KU93E,I was so encouraged by this video that I bought 7 copies for gifs this year. I've gotten calls from those I gifted since that time with the message that it so helped them keep their problems in the perspective of an incredible God.,1326844800,2,231,4.2727272727272725

3115965,5,B0013KU93E,This is an awesome DVD that everyone I've shown has loved.  Lots of amazing facts about astronomy that shows how small our earth really is.  The ending is worth waiting for.  Louie Giglio is supreme at explaining God's greatness.,1325203200,,229,4.82051282051282
3115966,4,B0013KU93E,"Taken from part of a talk delivered by Louie Giglio in Atlanta, Georgia, HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD is a lecture/presentation/sermon about the incredibly vast universe we live in and the amazing complexity of the human body even at a submolecular level. The presentation is definitely oriented towards Christians or those who are at least open to Christianity, but there are parts of the presentation that even non-Christians can find informative. For instance, the first half of the presentation deals mostly with how vast the universe is and how small Earth is in comparison. Beginning with Earth, he begins talking about other stars and galaxies leading into a brief discussion of the largest known star in the universe, Canis Majoris (actually VY Canis Majoris, but Giglio refers to it simply as Canis Majoris). The last half of the presentation deals with the complexity of the human body, with some vivid illustrations about the amount of DNA in a person and ending with a discussion about the protein laminin.

I enjoyed HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD. I already knew much of the information about stars and galaxies, but it was nice to be reminded. Much of the information about the human body was new to me. For instance, I had heard of laminin before, but only in passing and the name was only slightly familiar. Now I have a better understanding of what it is. Giglio is a great speaker and I enjoyed listening to him. However, I could have done without much of the ""mood music"" that was played in the last third of the presentation. I enjoy music, but it's overused in Christian churches to the extent that the music becomes meaningless.

HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD is a great DVD for churches or youth group to play as part of a Bible study or discussion time.",1323907200,2,1751,4.681818181818182
3115967,5,B0013KU93E,"Very quick review:  these two video presentations are about 45-60 minutes each and are great for showing to people who do not believe in God or don't know what they believe about God.  The presentations are very good for the Christmas season, and for this price it is the best deal around.

Personally, the 12 Words dvd was my least favorite of Louie Giglio's, but the How Great Is Our God presentation still gives me the chills every time I watch it.  I am definitely considering buying this package for Christmas gifts for a number of people, Christians and non-Christians.

Great encouragement for anyone, and we all need that.  Two thumbs up!",1322784000,9,646,4.723214285714286
3115968,5,B0013KU93E,One of the best Christian movies we've seen in a long time and certainly want to look into others that have been put out by Giglio.,1319587200,,131,4.076923076923077

3115970,5,B0013KU93E,This dvd is something we should all watch to get a glimpse of the magnitude of God's greatness.  It looks into space at the shear size of the universe and the planets and stars that our God spoke and breathed into existance.  It's a good video for a small or large group.  I enjoyed it and it changed my view of God's greatness.,1318550400,,328,4.174603174603175
3115971,5,B0013KU93E,"If you ever wondered if God is really intimate in our lives, this is the DVD that expresses this in just one big way.

The way he works us all into the ""big picture"" of the universe is unique, entertaining and awesome.  It's been a couple of years since I first saw it and, still, I just gave two as gifts this past Christmas!  A year ago I shared it with a friend, Jim, and he said the video impressed him so much that he showed it to his entire congregation and they are still talking about it to this day.  He said they all took the information from the video case, rushed home, got on Amazon and purchased a copy of their own.  The way I look at it, my Mom tossed a little stone into a BIG pond and the splash is still rippling across the water.  You will never forget the message Louie shares in this video.

3116010,5,B0013KU93E,"Just to add briefly to the other reviews, I also thought ""How Great Is Our God"" was amazing.  This is the second DVD--first one is ""Indescribable"".  You can buy them individually or in a set.  Having now seen the first two, I bought the set and suggest that you will likely want to do the same.

The DVDs are talks given by the Christian group of musicians and speakers on the ""Passion"" tour in 2006.  The first two DVDs are Louie Giglio speaking and are 40-45 minutes in length.  How Great is Our God naturally follows Indescribable, and Mr. Giglio refers to things from that talk, but you won't be lost if you see this one first.

Like the first video, this talk is able to be viewed with or without a Bible in hand.  The talk is largely a visual experience, so it can be used in many settings.  Excellent, and most Christians will likely be fighting tears.  It is piercing, moving, humbling, and awe-inspiring.  I loved seeing it during Lent for the first time, but anytime of year would be appropriate.  5 stars--you're going to want to share this one!",1269388800,54,1056,4.442708333333333

3116028,5,B0013KU93E,"This DVD is a recording of one of Giglio's recent public presentations, and covers similar ground to some his earlier talks, including his ""Indescribable"" DVD. It is a quite moving and powerful presentation. Just the complexity and size of the universe is so very mind-blowing, and the way it is presented here really makes one appreciate the grandeur and wonder of our creator God. Making use of amazing NASA colour images of the cosmos, Giglio unpacks biblical themes which remind us not only of the greatness of God, but of the amazing fact that we have cosmic significance in this vast universe.

Indeed, in this DVD he goes from the majestic to the miniscule. We tour the solar system, and we also tour the smallest components of the human body. Those who like the big ticket items of science, such as astronomy and cosmology, will marvel at the images of our solar system. And those who are in awe of the tiniest of what life is all about will be fascinated by the inner workings of cellular life, and what the molecular biologists are telling us.

Consider our universe. The sun, which is 93 million miles away from our earth, is so large that 960,000 earths could fit inside it. And that is just a relatively small star. Betelgeuse, which is 427 light years away, is twice the size of the earth's orbit around the sun. It is so humongous that 262 trillion earths could fit in it.

The largest known star is Canis Majoris. It is so incredibly massive that seven quadrillion earths could fit inside it. Yet the same God who breathes out the stars from his mouth (Psalm 33:6) is the one who cares intimately about us, and seeks to rescue us. As Giglio puts it, the star breather has become the sin bearer. The universe maker is also our redeemer.

Giglio reminds us that God is the creator of the heavens and the earth. This quick look at the vastness of the known universe must humble us, and cause us all to bow down and worship the creator of all things. The heavens certainly declare the glory of God (Psalm 19:1).

But we are also fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14). Our beginning lies in one microscopic cell from our mother, and one from our father. These form one new cell, with a totally new and unique set of DNA. It contains three billion characters of code. This one tiny cell contains all the information and instructions needed to produce us.

This one cell divides, and soon an embryo becomes a baby which becomes a child which becomes an adult. The single cell now gives way to 75 trillion cells in the human body. Every one of these cells has all three billion bits of our genetic code. Every three seconds 50,000 cells die and are replaced in our bodies.

We are truly amazing creations of a truly amazing creator God. Giglio takes these marvelous truths of science and ties them in with biblical lessons which should encourage and stimulate us all. This is not dry science but living lessons from both the Word of God and the world of God. The two bear witness to each other, and give us a picture of an amazing God, and of us, the crown of his creation.

There might be one weakness of the DVD however. Giglio uses the cross-shaped protein molecule Laminin and the cross-shaped center of the black hole in the Whirlpool galaxy to argue for divine signatures in nature. But he may just be reading too much into things here.

Presumably many other cross-shaped items appear in nature, both big and small, which have no special Christian meaning or purpose. We need to be careful not to put all our apologetics eggs into this one basket. Perhaps this is all just a case of unnecessary speculation and wishful thinking. Was this important protein molecule specifically designed in the shape of the cross by God as a witness to Christ and Calvary? Perhaps. But then again, it may just be the way it looks, with no further significance than that.

And if it was meant to be some kind of signpost to God or source of comfort to believers (along with the black hole cross), then over 99 per cent of Christians (in history past) would have  missed out on them, since they are both quite recent discoveries.

But don't let that detract from the overall value of the DVD. I still recommend that believers have a look at it. This DVD, like his others, is well worth viewing and sharing with your friends. In an age of secularism and cynicism, we need to be reminded of the greatness and grandeur of God. And we need to be reminded of how remarkable it is that we are made in the image of this awesome God.",1210809600,,4529,4.516483516483516

3350318,3,B0013KU93E,"While the guy is a good speaker, the overall message is pretty much ""how great is our universe.""  He would be a great speaker for a science course, talking about the cosmos and how enormous it is as a testament to God's greatness.  While the info is interesting, and possibly good info for someone who is on the fence about whether or not they believe in God, for the practicing, believing Christian, it feels almost like universe worship. Yes, he does talk about the God who created it, but the true focus seems to be awe of the stars.

I bought the three video set, given the great reviews, and wish I could have watched them on Amazon instead.  It's not something I would buy.  This particular video, toward the end, talks about how God loves you and if you're feeling down, how a God this powerful is able to help.  That is the gem of this video and why I gave it three stars.

He also explains the miracle of our bodies as they grow from two cells to adulthood.  He puts it all into easy to understand language spiced with humor, stories, graphics and sincere enthusiasm.  For those reasons alone, everyone should watch this DVD whether you believe in creationism or evolution.  Worst case, you might come away with a new perspective of how enormous the universe is.  Best case, you might just come away with a new perspective of a God actually existing who is greater than you have ever imagined.",1363910400,2,678,4.760683760683761

Almost everyone that sees it wants a copy.  I still offer to show it to whoever will let me show it to them.  I can't say too much about this presentation.
As of 3 30 16, I have purchased 150 DVD s.  I have four in my possession, this is the most revealing video of our time.  It is only 42 minutes long, but seems like an hour or two.  Every person in the world should view this video.  Most people know a little about the first section, but practically nothing about the last half.  If I were Louie Giglio, I would put it out as a free education video so everyone could view it.
By the way, I've watched the video over fifty times, now, and I will look at it again.  Jesse",1353110400,,837,3.9520958083832336

I've had this for sometime and still play it when we have fellowship or just to show how great is our God and LORD Jesus Christ. I recommend that you watch 'Indescribable' first, which is also very very good. I've watched it several times and still like watching it.",1340928000,,433,4.3580246913580245

3350459,5,B0013KU93E,"If you've ever seen Louie Giglio  Live, on YouTube or on DVD you know that it inspires.  All Christians should see How Great Is Our God to just be encouraged about how BIG our GOD is. Also non-Christian will find it inspiring as a evangelistic tool as he goes into a lot of science to prove that there is no doubt that God created all things.  Amazing! I've seen it several times and still shout and weep at how Great GOD's LOVE is for me. Leaves you feeling and knowing that GOD is greater than we can possibly begin to understand. HE IS big enough for any problem we have. Give this as a gift. It will change lives and be a blessing!",1327881600,6,635,4.146341463414634
3350460,5,B0013KU93E,I was so encouraged by this video that I bought 7 copies for gifs this year. I've gotten calls from those I gifted since that time with the message that it so helped them keep their problems in the perspective of an incredible God.,1326844800,2,231,4.2727272727272725

3350462,5,B0013KU93E,This is an awesome DVD that everyone I've shown has loved.  Lots of amazing facts about astronomy that shows how small our earth really is.  The ending is worth waiting for.  Louie Giglio is supreme at explaining God's greatness.,1325203200,,229,4.82051282051282
3350463,4,B0013KU93E,"Taken from part of a talk delivered by Louie Giglio in Atlanta, Georgia, HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD is a lecture/presentation/sermon about the incredibly vast universe we live in and the amazing complexity of the human body even at a submolecular level. The presentation is definitely oriented towards Christians or those who are at least open to Christianity, but there are parts of the presentation that even non-Christians can find informative. For instance, the first half of the presentation deals mostly with how vast the universe is and how small Earth is in comparison. Beginning with Earth, he begins talking about other stars and galaxies leading into a brief discussion of the largest known star in the universe, Canis Majoris (actually VY Canis Majoris, but Giglio refers to it simply as Canis Majoris). The last half of the presentation deals with the complexity of the human body, with some vivid illustrations about the amount of DNA in a person and ending with a discussion about the protein laminin.

I enjoyed HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD. I already knew much of the information about stars and galaxies, but it was nice to be reminded. Much of the information about the human body was new to me. For instance, I had heard of laminin before, but only in passing and the name was only slightly familiar. Now I have a better understanding of what it is. Giglio is a great speaker and I enjoyed listening to him. However, I could have done without much of the ""mood music"" that was played in the last third of the presentation. I enjoy music, but it's overused in Christian churches to the extent that the music becomes meaningless.

HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD is a great DVD for churches or youth group to play as part of a Bible study or discussion time.",1323907200,2,1751,4.681818181818182
3350464,5,B0013KU93E,"Very quick review:  these two video presentations are about 45-60 minutes each and are great for showing to people who do not believe in God or don't know what they believe about God.  The presentations are very good for the Christmas season, and for this price it is the best deal around.

Personally, the 12 Words dvd was my least favorite of Louie Giglio's, but the How Great Is Our God presentation still gives me the chills every time I watch it.  I am definitely considering buying this package for Christmas gifts for a number of people, Christians and non-Christians.

Great encouragement for anyone, and we all need that.  Two thumbs up!",1322784000,9,646,4.723214285714286
3350465,5,B0013KU93E,One of the best Christian movies we've seen in a long time and certainly want to look into others that have been put out by Giglio.,1319587200,,131,4.076923076923077

3350467,5,B0013KU93E,This dvd is something we should all watch to get a glimpse of the magnitude of God's greatness.  It looks into space at the shear size of the universe and the planets and stars that our God spoke and breathed into existance.  It's a good video for a small or large group.  I enjoyed it and it changed my view of God's greatness.,1318550400,,328,4.174603174603175
3350468,5,B0013KU93E,"If you ever wondered if God is really intimate in our lives, this is the DVD that expresses this in just one big way.

This is so powerful that we have shown it at a youth camp (and youth event) and they have walked away from the whole experience claiming this video was one of the most compelling things they had seen. You don't get all the worship music, but it's a great message. Giglio is a fantastic and entertaining speaker.",1316736000,,458,4.337209302325581

I am always anxious to hear what they think and yet I'm never surprised to hear the same knock-your-socks-off love for Louie's story.  The way he works us all into the ""big picture"" of the universe is unique, entertaining and awesome.  It's been a couple of years since I first saw it and, still, I just gave two as gifts this past Christmas!  A year ago I shared it with a friend, Jim, and he said the video impressed him so much that he showed it to his entire congregation and they are still talking about it to this day.  He said they all took the information from the video case, rushed home, got on Amazon and purchased a copy of their own.  The way I look at it, my Mom tossed a little stone into a BIG pond and the splash is still rippling across the water.  You will never forget the message Louie shares in this video.  You will see God's love told in an entirely new and exciting way and you will cherish it forever, I promise.  This story will implant itself into your soul and never, ever leave you.",1294444800,,1235,4.177215189873418

Louie Giglio does an excellent job of describing and hi-lighting God's greatness!  IF a God can speak, create and set our vast solar system into existence, what can He do with our small problems?  A must see!

We have given out over 200+ of these DVD's.  We always receive phone calls and cards stating what an incredible DVD.  The recipients we gift then share the DVD with others. They have it shown at their churches...we have been told that many have accepted Christ from viewing this DVD!

But to walk through the steps necessary to try to get a grasp on how large is this universe God created was eye-opening. Louie is talking to a young crowd with fine humor, but older folks will appreciate what He says. He also uses good pictoral/visual aids, including the golf ball. Can you imagine enough golf balls to cover the state of Texas...22"" deep? I cannot, but it sure fires my imagination!

I watched the youtube segments, then bought the dvd and showed it to members of four church congregations on a weekday night. I heard no words of disappointment and many were still talking about it weeks later.",1288051200,2,786,4.458333333333333

I do not understand how anybody can give this DVD even one star? Except that it was watched in tent in Afghanistan in 1930.

3350507,5,B0013KU93E,"Just to add briefly to the other reviews, I also thought ""How Great Is Our God"" was amazing.  This is the second DVD--first one is ""Indescribable"".  You can buy them individually or in a set.  Having now seen the first two, I bought the set and suggest that you will likely want to do the same.

The DVDs are talks given by the Christian group of musicians and speakers on the ""Passion"" tour in 2006.  The first two DVDs are Louie Giglio speaking and are 40-45 minutes in length.  How Great is Our God naturally follows Indescribable, and Mr. Giglio refers to things from that talk, but you won't be lost if you see this one first.

Like the first video, this talk is able to be viewed with or without a Bible in hand.  The talk is largely a visual experience, so it can be used in many settings.  Excellent, and most Christians will likely be fighting tears.  It is piercing, moving, humbling, and awe-inspiring.  I loved seeing it during Lent for the first time, but anytime of year would be appropriate.  5 stars--you're going to want to share this one!",1269388800,54,1056,4.442708333333333

3350525,5,B0013KU93E,"This DVD is a recording of one of Giglio's recent public presentations, and covers similar ground to some his earlier talks, including his ""Indescribable"" DVD. It is a quite moving and powerful presentation. Just the complexity and size of the universe is so very mind-blowing, and the way it is presented here really makes one appreciate the grandeur and wonder of our creator God. Making use of amazing NASA colour images of the cosmos, Giglio unpacks biblical themes which remind us not only of the greatness of God, but of the amazing fact that we have cosmic significance in this vast universe.

Indeed, in this DVD he goes from the majestic to the miniscule. We tour the solar system, and we also tour the smallest components of the human body. Those who like the big ticket items of science, such as astronomy and cosmology, will marvel at the images of our solar system. And those who are in awe of the tiniest of what life is all about will be fascinated by the inner workings of cellular life, and what the molecular biologists are telling us.

Consider our universe. The sun, which is 93 million miles away from our earth, is so large that 960,000 earths could fit inside it. And that is just a relatively small star. Betelgeuse, which is 427 light years away, is twice the size of the earth's orbit around the sun. It is so humongous that 262 trillion earths could fit in it.

The largest known star is Canis Majoris. It is so incredibly massive that seven quadrillion earths could fit inside it. Yet the same God who breathes out the stars from his mouth (Psalm 33:6) is the one who cares intimately about us, and seeks to rescue us. As Giglio puts it, the star breather has become the sin bearer. The universe maker is also our redeemer.

Giglio reminds us that God is the creator of the heavens and the earth. This quick look at the vastness of the known universe must humble us, and cause us all to bow down and worship the creator of all things. The heavens certainly declare the glory of God (Psalm 19:1).

But we are also fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14). Our beginning lies in one microscopic cell from our mother, and one from our father. These form one new cell, with a totally new and unique set of DNA. It contains three billion characters of code. This one tiny cell contains all the information and instructions needed to produce us.

This one cell divides, and soon an embryo becomes a baby which becomes a child which becomes an adult. The single cell now gives way to 75 trillion cells in the human body. Every one of these cells has all three billion bits of our genetic code. Every three seconds 50,000 cells die and are replaced in our bodies.

We are truly amazing creations of a truly amazing creator God. Giglio takes these marvelous truths of science and ties them in with biblical lessons which should encourage and stimulate us all. This is not dry science but living lessons from both the Word of God and the world of God. The two bear witness to each other, and give us a picture of an amazing God, and of us, the crown of his creation.

There might be one weakness of the DVD however. Giglio uses the cross-shaped protein molecule Laminin and the cross-shaped center of the black hole in the Whirlpool galaxy to argue for divine signatures in nature. But he may just be reading too much into things here.

Presumably many other cross-shaped items appear in nature, both big and small, which have no special Christian meaning or purpose. We need to be careful not to put all our apologetics eggs into this one basket. Perhaps this is all just a case of unnecessary speculation and wishful thinking. Was this important protein molecule specifically designed in the shape of the cross by God as a witness to Christ and Calvary? Perhaps. But then again, it may just be the way it looks, with no further significance than that.

And if it was meant to be some kind of signpost to God or source of comfort to believers (along with the black hole cross), then over 99 per cent of Christians (in history past) would have  missed out on them, since they are both quite recent discoveries.

But don't let that detract from the overall value of the DVD. I still recommend that believers have a look at it. This DVD, like his others, is well worth viewing and sharing with your friends. In an age of secularism and cynicism, we need to be reminded of the greatness and grandeur of God. And we need to be reminded of how remarkable it is that we are made in the image of this awesome God.",1210809600,,4529,4.516483516483516
