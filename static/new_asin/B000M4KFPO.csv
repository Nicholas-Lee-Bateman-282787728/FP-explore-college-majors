8166217,1,B000M4KFPO,This is more about the quality of the DVDs.  It was clearly a bootleg copy and not well done.  It was unwatchable unfortunately.,1323734400,,128,4.521739130434782
8166218,4,B000M4KFPO,"Very nice, it arrived very fast.  I'm very sad to watch this movie because of what happened to the male leading character.  I want to see more of his movies, dramas, concert, etc.  Of course, Eugene is as lovery as she always be.",1285027200,2,229,4.27906976744186
8166219,2,B000M4KFPO,"Loving You feels like a boilerplate Korean romance drama. A guy (portrayed by Park Yong Ha) falls in love with a girl (portrayed by the lovely ""Eugene""), but there are circumstances the couple must overcome to be together. The story and acting are not bad, but not compelling or distinct. This drama starts with several interesting premises, but the main thread -- that of the romance between the two main characters -- ends timidly. As a result, Loving You is something to watch if you have some idle time, but is ultimately a forgettable experience.",1199059200,4,551,4.810526315789474
