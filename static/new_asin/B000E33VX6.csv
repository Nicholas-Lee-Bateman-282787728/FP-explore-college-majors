8104850,5,B000E33VX6,I thoroughly enjoyed both of these films about two of the 60's most quirky and memorable figures. Hoffman and Harris deliver stellar performances.,1383955200,,146,5.391304347826087
8104851,3,B000E33VX6,"One night (the worst time to surf and shop, I hunted for DVDs.  Although I was pleased with the product and very quick standard-mail delivery, think twice--or more--before something like a double pack.  It may seem like something you would want at a late hour, but I found myself really wanting only one of the DVDs.  This was Pollock and Capote, two artists who were greatly portrayed by Ed Harris and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, respectively.  It's a shame Ed Harris came out with Pollock in 2000, the year of Gladiator and Russell Crowe.  When all was said and done, I could have easily been happy with Pollock and saved money rather than think I was saving money by buying a double pack.  The condition of the DVDs was excellent, however.  Also, if you are new to Amazon as a buyer, look out for putting items in the cart.  Not only did I regret getting this double pack, but checking out was confusing.  I did not see what was actually in the cart or what the total ultimately was.  I ended up double buying the double pack!  But I give credit to Amazon for giving me a credit in return when I explained the circumstances.",1207353600,,1124,4.46078431372549
