Been devouring everything on permaculture I can find (books, videos, websites etc).  Overall, each CD is divided into short 10-12 min chapters across a very wide range of topics (from wood splitting to Keyline design).  That means you get a broad scope but not a lot of depth.  I've been farming commercially for about 8 years now, have advanced degrees in ecology, sustainable energy, and eco-design, so I found many parts too basic.  I was hoping it would be a DVD of an actual in-depth course that related topography, hydrology, soil, vegetation, energy, etc., into site design/drafting/layout that I could use for my own recently purchased property that is a mix of level, sloping, and hill-top.  It is not that.  It just introduces these ideas, the books I've read were better.  I found myself skipping over some chapters and listening to others.  I picked up some things here and there, but it was the opposite of in-depth because the scope was too broad.  I would still buy it again, but, will have to go to other resources for deeper knowledge.  At the end of each chapter/sub-chapter is a list of resources/books which will let me add to my library.  Good intro, sparse (but not bare) if you're looking for depth.",1505260800,8,1378,4.66390041493776
8717512,5,B00Y3NRKZS,Great DVD with lots of useful information!,1496188800,,42,5.142857142857143
8717513,5,B00Y3NRKZS,"Excellent visual presentation. Just what you need to prepare for a PDC in the Northeast. Presentations are clear, easy to understand, and fully permeated with permacultural prowess. It's a good idea to soak in a presentation at normal speed first time or two, then review it at faster speed, an option I took full advantage of.",1439942400,6,327,4.857142857142857
8717514,5,B00Y3NRKZS,"Amazing amount of practical information! Just that is worth more than what I paid for it... and the quality is great, couldn't ask for more. Even after doing 2 PDCs I still learned a bunch of new stuff from top experts, Thanks",1439769600,9,226,4.404761904761905
8717515,5,B00Y3NRKZS,"I bought this through their kickstarter.  Olivier Asselin and team never fails to deliver.  Beautiful cinematography, and top notch content, delightful music.  Good for both those who are ""way into permaculture"" - but good for your everyday homesteader, too!  Don't let the title scare you away - if you know zero about permaculture, this DVD is for you.  No, you cannot find this quality on youtube.  Highly recommended.",1439596800,11,421,5.117647058823529
8717516,5,B00Y3NRKZS,This course everyone. If you are new to permaculture this is a great introduction. If you have taken a PDC but have little on the ground experience (like me) you will really gain from seeing several techniques in practice as well as round out some of your current knowledge. If you are an experienced permaculturalist you get some of the benefits previously stated and you will most likely just enjoy seeing some of the systems already in play. In fact if you just want to see beautifully done permaculture this course is worth every penny. I would have been happy to pay 4 times the current price and been happy to do so. If you love permaculture this needs to be in your library.,1439424000,11,681,4.5
