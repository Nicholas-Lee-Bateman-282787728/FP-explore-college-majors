5003663,3,B006LPI0KU,"If there is one reason to own this DVD, it is Dessay.  A natural query is ""Why would Dessay get involved in a production like this?""  Seeing Dessay in Met's La Traviata recently (HD theatres) inspired me to buy the present DVD, which is the only Violetta available with Dessay.  We see a vivacious forty-year-old face on a lithe twenty-year-old frame.  It is a pleasure.  Her performance brought back memories of watching Callas as Cio Cio San, and Moffo as Lucia more than half a century ago.  Callas, Moffo, and Dessay can now be spoken in the same breath.

What a contrast!  This Virgin version is embedded in a third-rate setting (using that word loosely, sorry) and choreography.  It is impossible for anyone, including Dessay, to inspire her compatriots, who at best are indifferent, and at worse lacks imagination.  These singers performed in their street clothes. Annina even brought along her newspaper to keep her from being bored.  She needed it at the beginning of Act 1 (bit of sarcasm here).  Georgio Germont looks more like Alfredo's little brother than his father.  A little make up would have helped.  I came away with the feeling that these so-called professional artists simply didn't give a damn.

Verdi would not recognize this opera.  Conclusion:  Dessay = 5 stars;  others = 1 star. Average = 3 stars

As gifted as Dessay is, with her voice, beauty, and unrivaled acting talent, she would have been an automatic all-time prima donna.  She virtually threw that away by repeatedly appearing in forgetable third-rate productions, like the present one.  Sad!",1337126400,27,1577,4.920152091254753
5003664,3,B006LPI0KU,"Natalie Dessay is an artist whom I admire greatly for her singing, acting, intelligence and musicianship.  This performance is ample reason why.  Here is a well-sung and compelling acted performance of one of opera's more challenging roles.  At times I thought her characterization was a bit edgy - on the verge in a manner more suited to Lucia than to Violetta - but, still, it's a thoughtful and valid portrayal.  Her singing is technically brilliant (as in ""Sempre libera"") and deeply moving (""Addio del passato"") where needed.  I was particularly pleased that she takes both verses of both her arias.  The last several performances of I've seen in the theatre have used these erstwhile traditional cuts.

Miss Dessay is well-matched in the Alfredo of Charles Castronovo.  He has a pleasing lyric voice and shows a commendable empathy for a not altogether sympathetic character.  His singing is tasteful and involved, though he does come close to losing the high C at the end of his second act cabaletta.

The most serious drawback to this performance is the Giorgio Germont of Ludovic Tezier.  To my ears, at least, his voice is dry and colourless and his technique a bit dicey.  Add to this that he shows about as much emotion as if he were singing listings from the telephone directory and you'll understand the damage he does in the great second act scena with Violetta.  He's no better in his briefer appearances later in the opera.

Even the comprimarios are a pretty sorry lot.  It's obvious why these persons are singing with the principals and not as the principals.  Perhaps Mr. Tezier would have been better with them.

The updated setting adds nothing to the work and detracts slightly from it.  I'd like the opera to be about persons who are a bit more sophisticated than the bottle-chugging partiers in the first scenes of the first and second acts.  The pointless, though pleasant, choruses of gypsies and matadors in Act 2, Scene 2 seem even more pointless than usual.  Perhaps worst is Violetta's standing-up death, followed by a little stroll across the stage after she's been pronounced dead.

On the whole, I would recommend this only for Miss Dessay's Violetta with some additional enjoyment from Mr Castronovo's Alfredo.  As a first, or only, DVD of this opera, I'd go with the Georg Solti version from Covent Garden.",1334966400,31,2342,4.875949367088608
5003665,3,B006LPI0KU,"I watched the documentary of the making of this production, ""becoming traviata"", I may have the name wrong, it's not included on this disk. It's a very interesting film and made me want to see a DVD of the production. Unfortunately this is one of the least satisfying opera DVDs I've ever seen, and it's difficult to say why. The performances are very strong but the directing didn't get captured well on video. I can't even decide whether it was a great experience in person or not. The style of the directing is not about making strong stage pictures but rather creating detailed intimate moments of acting... and you would think video would capture those well, but for me it wasn't satisfying. Other people may feel differently but for me the music and singing were great and the visual experience was unsatisfying.

To give you a benchmark, I loved the DVDs of giulio cesare with Danielle de Niese, and the Metropolitan opera Bernard Schenck Ring cycle.",1386460800,7,957,4.765060240963855
5003666,5,B006LPI0KU,"Natalie Dessay triumphs here--beautiful vocalism and total dramatic commitment.  I had seen the documentary and was pleased at how the director worked with his singers instead of going for some idiosyncratic interpretation (alas, that is not entirely true in the finished product).  The tenor is fine and the baritone splendid.  Dessay's final moment will tear your heart out.",1379030400,,376,5.448275862068965

5003668,5,B006LPI0KU,This opera is usually seen in period dress and settings. This was in today's dress and a stark setting. Natalie Dessay did a wonderful portrayal of her character and I am pleased with the purchase.,1376438400,,197,4.6571428571428575

5003670,5,B006LPI0KU,"Wonderful performance of a very sad story with just beautiful music. I am a fan of comedic opera that leaves me feeling great. This one is sad, but the music is well worth it.",1357430400,3,175,4.176470588235294
5003671,4,B006LPI0KU,I admired the production and wanted to listen to the work of the leading lady immediately after the DVD was completed. That is postive comment enough. It is not a traditional look at the work; it is not placed in its time and place; it is another viewpoint and I think legitimate.,1355961600,12,280,4.403846153846154
5003672,5,B006LPI0KU,"Dessay is worth any moment! I hope to have many  more operas with her! However, if you keep asking fopr more words I may refuse all of your requests!",1354406400,2,149,4.137931034482759
5003673,3,B006LPI0KU,"I find this production wonderul singing and wonderful orchestral playing, but totally unconvincing.  Although I love Natalie Dessay's performances, her Violetta falls short.  Dessay is just too innocent, cute and girlish to be convincing. I simply can't see her being a courtesan, or a call girl, or whatever she's supposed to be in this production.  And therein lies the problem with me:  This ""Traviata"" just didn't do the trick.  It was too modern and too sparsely conceived.  ""Traviata"" calls for brilliant salon scenes and gorgeous costumes of the Nineteenth Century Parisian variety.
  Dessay's portrayal of Violetta's death in Act III, however, was incredibly dramatic acting.  The best I've ever seen.
  Ludovic Tezier is another matter.  To me he can't act his way through anything.  His eyes are dead and his face and body movements totally unconvincing in anything I've seen him do.  The voice is lovely, but...",1339372800,5,922,5.183673469387755
8500452,5,B006LPI0KU,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this modern adaptation but Natalie Dessay stole my heart. This is a beautiful opera and Dessay carries the day. She embodies the part more fully than I have seen in any other La Traviata.

There are few DVDs of Me. dessay so don't let this get away.",1486166400,,283,4.1454545454545455
8500453,4,B006LPI0KU,"5 stars for the cast and particularly Natalie Dessay,s performance- if not the greatest Violetta vocally (though she is right up there) she is by far the most intense dramatically.  The one star off is for the production itself.  I'm by no means a traditionalist, but this was a little over the top.",1476144000,,299,4.622641509433962

8500455,5,B006LPI0KU,Dessay is brilliant in this Traviata. I regret that she has retired.,1467936000,,68,4.75
8500456,3,B006LPI0KU,"As long as I kept my eyes closed it was great.  As soon as I had to looked at the bare stage, simplistic and inappropriate costumes, and often bizarre staging the magic was gone.  ""Euro trash?""  ""High concept?""  I think that director moved much too far from the original intent of the librettist and composer.  With so many really good La Traviata video recordings, this would not be my choice if I wanted only one.  Natalie Dessay is wonderful but a single performer cannot compensate for the rest of what I consider an ill conceived production.",1444521600,3,546,4.635416666666667
8500457,4,B006LPI0KU,"Rather stark staging, but Dessay is superb as always.",1444348800,,53,5.0
8500458,5,B006LPI0KU,"If you think you have seen La Traviata one time too many, try this one!
Natalie Dessay is the perfect interpreter of the title role, lending not just her beautiful voice but all her exquisite acting talent to this staging of the old Verdi staple.
The older-woman/younger man-aspect of the plot is courageously approached, the love story becoming a story of irresistible attraction and deep vulnerability on both sides. Never sentimental, every moment of this stunning performance is perfectly shaped. Sivadier, the director, was new to me, but I'll keep an eye on his work from now on.",1412121600,,585,4.979591836734694

8500461,5,B006LPI0KU,"Marvelous staging, singing and concept of less is more in costuming. Natalie Dessay is a marvelous singer and now I see that she is also an accomplished actor with  an incredible sense of knowing how the character would react.  Anyone who is interested in making opera more realistic would love this production.",1393545600,,311,4.961538461538462
