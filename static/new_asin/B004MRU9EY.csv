4432786,5,B004MRU9EY,"This is a treasure. Dionne is always at her finest with Burt. Wonderful historic venue, with a small crowd and backed up by great musicians. Dionne's voice is in great form and the interplay between Burt and Dionne is charming and genuine. I am so pleased this has made it to DVD. A wonderful array of music and conversation.",1372809600,,325,4.52542372881356

4432788,5,B004MRU9EY,I am a huge fan of Dionne Warwick and I had to have have this as a part of my collection. She is such an amazing singer and she performs many of her greatest hits on this DVD. You will really love this purchase!,1362268800,,211,3.8181818181818183
4432789,5,B004MRU9EY,"Just recently the fabulous lyricist Hal David who formed a magnificent trio of Burt Bacharach,songwriter and Dionne Warwick,vocalist has died.  Even as unfortunate is the rarity of film or video of Bacharach.  I search, in vain so far,  for the 2 or 3 special television programs Bacharach hosted in the swinging 60's.  In fact, Bacharach even appeared with an orchestra in Las Vegas!  Sammy Chan, a marvelous songwriter himself put it aptly.,""Burt Bacharach is the first and only songwriter that does not look like your dentist.  I digress. Buy this dvd!  It's playable here in USA and its quiet wondrous.  Normally I care not for medleys since if it is good enough to sing a bit, why not give fans the whole ball of wax?  However, this is one long, beautiful medley and it's swell.  Filmed in the historic and still delicious Rainbow Room night club atop the RCA/NBC Rockefeller Center it is from 1996.  No Hal David on screen but a fine orchestra and a full string section is on hand.  Bacharach still had a fabulous head of hair [Silver] plays piano and leads the band in that great dramatic sweeping ballet he loves to perform. He even ""sings"" in a couple of the songs with that flair so entrancing.  The music of his songs is so unique-remenber the 60s?  THe music is like a broadway musical on opening night filled with emotion, grand sweeps of beauty and  that stop and start, change of meter that would make Dave Brubeck envious.  Of coure, as of this revue the rule of 3's  with 3 celabrities of music recently dying included Brubeck, Rhavi Shankar and Patti Page.  On to Dionne, Bacharachs unique writing style is exceptionally demanding and no one, no one, carried it off so well.  Dionne looks wonderfull, her voice still is full of verve, and she sings all these 20 or so gems with rhythm and grace and verve.  The voice has changed as it does with all singers but her enunciation,timing, and pace remain grand.  Obviously, it you love wonderful music I recommend you grab this one up.",1359676800,8,1999,4.638176638176638
4432790,5,B004MRU9EY,"This is a great video and I was surprised to find that it was released.  I videotaped it when it first aired on AMC. This was a departure from movies, which normally appear on AMC.  Dionne states in the video that this was the first.  The highlights to me were the movie songs which included, Alfie, A House is Not a Home, The April Fools, Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head, and Theme from the Valley of the Dolls.  Most of Dionne's hits were featured on this show with Burt playing and conducting. Walk on By, Anyone Who Had a Heart, Do You Know the Way to San Jose?, and others are all here.  I've seen Burt and her in concert and it was great.  This is also just as wonderful and I don't have my VCR connected anymore, so I plan to purchase this.",1346112000,3,749,4.13103448275862

Some of my favorite songs on the DVD are Dionne singing I'll Never Love This Way Again, What The World Needs Know Is Love & That's What Friends Are For.  I would like to see Dionne Stand more on her songs and put more energy into some the songs she is singing.",1410566400,,320,4.229508196721311
8436228,3,B004MRU9EY,Entertaining but mostly Medleys. Much prefer listing to original recordings.,1408924800,,76,6.7
8436229,1,B004MRU9EY,"Buy this if you absolutely must have it for your collection, but make sure your expectations for quality video are VERY, VERY low.  This is obviously made from an old VHS recording, taking directly from a cable channel broadcast (you will actually see the logo show up in the corner of the screen often) and appears to be about 3 generations dubbed from even that!  Since it was recorded before the days of high def, it has even been stretched to claim 16x9 resolution which makes it look even much worse.  Audio is fair but again, don't be fooled by the DTS surround option...there is nothing beyond basic cable stereo signal going on here.  A wonderful performance by both incredible artists...just expect very poor bootleg quality because you'll have to say that is exactly what this DVD is when you see it...and a very poorly done bootleg!",1405900800,3,843,4.714285714285714

8436232,5,B004MRU9EY,"Burt and Dionne...awesome together!  Great songs, moving performance.  And lets not forget the magic of Hal David's lyrics.  I only wish I had seen this in person.",1376784000,2,163,4.962962962962963
