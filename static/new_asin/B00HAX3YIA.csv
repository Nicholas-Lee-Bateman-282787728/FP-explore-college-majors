6152857,5,B00HAX3YIA,"I love the pound workouts. Great cardio workout.. The DVDs are different then the actual pound classes.. Either way, I live them both.",1400889600,,134,4.869565217391305
6152858,4,B00HAX3YIA,I like to switch up my workouts and this is a good add-on to any workout routine. Geared towards a younger crowd 18-early 30's. Or anyone young at hear and enjoys dub-step type beats.,1400457600,,183,4.411764705882353
6152859,5,B00HAX3YIA,"These DVD's are great, I've been waiting a long time to get them, and have really enjoyed working out to them! I just knew they'd be more fun than any other workout, and I was right! I LOVE the sticks, and pounding, it's a stress reliever as well as a workout! :) The workouts are great too, I feel sore the next day, but in a good way. The routines are not too complicated that you can't follow along (I hate those that are so complicated that you can't keep up!), yet they are interesting and lots of fun. Their cues are good, which I think is important so you know what's coming up next and can keep up, especially when you're not able to look at the screen. All four of the workouts are tough, but not so tough that I can't keep up, and I am not in great shape...yet! The cardio session definitely made me sweat. And, the sticks are not just fun but really help me keep up, and keep the beat! I've always wanted to play the drums, and this is a fun substitute! :) I'm really looking forward to their next dvd!",1399680000,2,1013,4.121212121212121
6152860,4,B00HAX3YIA,"I got Pound today in the mail, so I hurried up and ripped it open, and started the first workout called Baseline. Wow! It was not only a legs/lower body workout, but it was also a cardio workout too. I was shocked by how quickly my heart rate went up while pounding away with the ripsticks. My legs and lower body are already sore too. This is a GOOD workout!

My only criticism that hopefully they will fix in the next release or future albums is that the music is way too soft. They need to offer a ""normal"" volume and then a ""loud"" volume for the music.",1398816000,60,556,4.148148148148148
6152861,5,B00HAX3YIA,"This is an excellent workout!,it is different,motivating and it really works! When I saw it the first time I just thought,wow it has to feel amazing playing an imaginary drum while you workout with sticks!,we'll I was not disappointed ,next day my legs were shaking! You can do the 20 min workouts or combine them to get a great workout!",1394928000,25,337,4.633333333333334
6152862,4,B00HAX3YIA,I LOVE taking Pound class which is why I bought the DVD. I am a little disappointed.  My favorite thing about class is the music is loud and you can rock out and get lost in the music. In the DVD you can barely hear the music which makes it feel more of a workout and less fun. If I had never taken a class I probably wouldn't have this complaint. They need to do it like a class where you talk less and the music is loud.,1393718400,28,422,3.7954545454545454
6152863,5,B00HAX3YIA,Who would think a set of drum sticks would make a good workout.  Apparently these ladies- and they are more than correct.  Holy crackers I am sore after 30 minutes of this.  And it's just a lot a whole lot of fun.,1393632000,17,213,4.023809523809524
6152864,5,B00HAX3YIA,"Fun routines.  It is definitely something different and that was what I was looking for.  A few nights a week, just doing this instead of hitting the gym",1515888000,,153,4.428571428571429
6152865,5,B00HAX3YIA,Great workout!,1514678400,,14,6.5
6152866,4,B00HAX3YIA,"Going to a live class is much more invigorating, but this serves a purpose when you need to do something quicker at home.",1512518400,2,121,4.304347826086956
6152867,5,B00HAX3YIA,"I am so happy that I ordered this workout! It comes with 2 DVDs that give you the intro and insight on how to perform the Pound moves safely and efficiently along with the workouts for the lower body, abdominals- and, the Ripstiks are included. It is so fun- and, the moves are so fascinating that I forget at times that I am exercising! Initially, I was concerned that I would have some difficulty doing the workout since I have some issues with my knees. But, this workout has that covered with the modified moves. And, I love that I still get the results with the modifications, especially with the ""T&A"" workout. This workout motivates me to keep coming back because I can feel my body getting stronger, and I can see the lift, and tone it is giving me. I am now a fan for life! Please keep the Pound workout DVDs coming!!!",1510963200,6,827,4.376623376623376
6152868,5,B00HAX3YIA,I ordered this after seeing a class  featured on a local television show.  It arrived faster than I thought it would.  I received 2 high quality plastic sticks and the 2 CD's.  I recommend starting from the beginning especially if you are rhythmically challenged like I am. It seems easy until you are all done and then you realize you just had a good workout.  I didn't always stay on beat but like they said just keep moving.  The time went so fast I couldn't believe it when it was over. I do a lot of home workouts and am always looking for new ones.  The girls take a lot of time to explain things.  I haven't done the more advanced one yet but I will get there.,1508544000,2,667,4.15625
6152869,1,B00HAX3YIA,The aide shows 2 CDs and the sticks. I only got one CD and it took for ever to come.,1507766400,6,84,3.25
6152870,4,B00HAX3YIA,"Drumsticks came a day later, FYI. Only comes with one disk.",1507593600,,59,4.454545454545454
6152871,5,B00HAX3YIA,"I work out on a regular basis.  This workout dvd definitely gives a terrific workout.  If you're looking for a new routine to spice up your home workout schedule, this is it.",1502064000,,174,4.40625
6152872,5,B00HAX3YIA,Love this workout and the sticks are the best.,1495065600,,46,4.222222222222222
6152873,4,B00HAX3YIA,"This workout is pretty fun and distracts you enough that you don't even realize how tough a workout it is.  The first time I did it I definitely didn't stretch enough and I was so focused on getting the moves right that I kept pausing and repeating sequences which left me sooo sore for days.  Lesson learned and I never made those mistakes again.
The music is pretty lame though.  I got interested in Pound after seeing an awesome promotional video that looked intense and rocked but the music on these dvds does not match that attitude. Its low,  unfamiliar, and borderline pop. Still,  i get a good workout that's fun so once i get comfortable with the moves I'll just use my own music probably.",1494201600,2,698,4.507936507936508

6152876,4,B00HAX3YIA,"This series makes me like exercise a little more. I will tell you that every one of the workouts are a very demanding excerise routine. I am not that out of shape, and had to get used to it. It is challenging but not impossible. No matter what I do, I am sore for days in places I dint know I had! It's a great workout. The caution I would say to mind is that for people who are very out of shape, I don't think it is for you. Also, they really should have done separate stretch and cool downs for the four videos, but they are the same, which is annoying. I feel they could stretch you out a little more as well. But, despite all that, it is so creative and fun. It really gets the job done.",1485648000,,692,3.9148936170212765
6152877,5,B00HAX3YIA,Love it,1484352000,,7,3.0
6152878,5,B00HAX3YIA,"If you are looking for a leg intensive workout and can handle a lot of squats this is for you.  It is so much fun.  I have a hip replacement and have to modify often, but I'm still dripping with sweat at the end.  If you like to dance, I think you'll like it because it's beat driven.  I thought this would be an easy every other day workout I could do.  Um, no you sweat your butt off and your legs and arms are jello if you work hard!  I wish I knew the difference between this and the big set they have for sale.  $90 seems pretty expensive for it!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/POUND-Rockout-Results-System/dp/B01BIJWH8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">POUND Rockout Results System</a>&nbsp;without ever trying it, so I opted for this as a test to see if I liked it.  Now I find myself wanting to buy the big set!  I wish I could take the live classes.  I hear they are even more fun",1481328000,,927,4.7375

6152884,5,B00HAX3YIA,"Great introduction to the pound workout. Comes with sticks and a couple of great workouts. It advertises a connection to their website for more workouts, but there is NO extra workouts available. I wrote the company and they stated that promotion had expired. That was my only disappointment. The videos do a great job explaining the workouts and how to adjust for various abilities",1476057600,3,382,4.984375
6152885,5,B00HAX3YIA,I love this! Used to be in great physical shape but as I get older there are less workouts I can do. This is fun and I can actually do it and still get a fabulous workout,1475452800,,170,3.6216216216216215

6152890,5,B00HAX3YIA,I love this workout!  I have chronic back pain and it is difficult for me to find workouts that I can do.  I do not like dance cardio and the bootcamps are too strenuous on my back.  I love this as I can do most of the moves and the ones I can't I can modify and still get an effective workout.  Highly recommend.,1470614400,4,313,3.84375

I use this program daily and feel like it is a workout for people of all shapes and sizes. The moves aren't super difficult, but there are a lot of squats.",1464998400,3,332,4.370967741935484

6152900,5,B00HAX3YIA,"I decided to but the Pound workout DVD after I heard about it on Facebook. According to the video I saw, this new workout system was all the rage in New York City. Since the DVD was fairly inexpensive, I decided to give it a shot. The kit comes with 2 CDs, each of which comes with 2 workout routines and an instructional video of how to get the most out of Pound.
The introduction video teaches you how to position your body correctly while working out so that you are maximizing your experience. The video was very helpful!
The first CD has two workouts, Bassline and Tune-up, both of which are awesome workouts. Bassline targets the lower body (glutes, thighs and legs) mostly through pilates and squats. I was surprised at how sore I was after doing this workout (3 whole days to be specific)!
The Tune-up targets the upper-body, using a lot of plank based workouts. Tune-up, although it gives a good workout, it the lightest of all 4 workout routines.
The second CD contains Poundcore and CardioJam. Poundcore targets the abs and will really get those abs burning. It is a super intense workout with a lot of twists. I tend to lose my balance and get left behind a lot while doing this workout so it definitely needs some practice. I found myself following the modified version (being performed by a girl in the back).
CardioJam was the final video and focused on cardio obviously. Out of all four workouts, this one got my heart rate up the highest! This workout was by far the most fun and I felt like a got a great overall cardio workout with this routine.
Overall, I love these DVDs! They are easy to use and highly organized. Each video starts off with a warmup, then continues to the main workout and ends with a cool down. The moves are not too hard to follow, and once you have done it once, you can almost predict what is coming next. There is always a girl in the back of the videos doing a modified version of whatever workout is being done, so if you need a breather or cannot keep up, you can switch to following her for a few minutes to catch your breath. Just these four workouts are enough to tone your entire body.

 My only complaint is that the music is not very loud. If it were louder, I would definitely have more fun and be even more motivated, but I enjoy these workouts regardless. Once I have memorized the routines, I will definitely use them to work out while blasting my own music.",1462406400,3,2415,4.400447427293065
6152901,5,B00HAX3YIA,Awesome workout!!! Totally worth it,1461542400,,35,6.2
6152902,3,B00HAX3YIA,"This feels so instructional that I really did not enjoy it. I learned about Pound from the live classes which has some really fun music and lights. This music was horrible (as it is with most workout videos) and unknown.
If you couldn't tell by the cover, the instructors think A LOT of themselves. And while they had a clever idea, it's clear that they are amateurs at producing videos that are fun and engaging.
Skip this DVD and find a class.",1460592000,10,445,4.439024390243903
6152903,4,B00HAX3YIA,"I have been looking for a way to get my pound workout since I moved to a city where it has not caught on, but I wanted something for the Wii, like I do with Zumba. I received this as a gift! The packaging and delivery was great. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the instructors are and even learned some subtle differences in the moves I did not see when just following my regular instructor. The workouts are really effective. I would have thought they could at least alternate two warm-up and cool-down sessions among the discs or let you choose, but it is the same ones for each session, which can get old. My biggest thing though was that the main thing I missed about Pound was getting some stress out pounding to the beat of some popular or beat heavy songs while getting my workout, and this does not provide that. The music has no words, was all unknown to me, and was often soft elevatorlike music. The workout is good, and I am glad to have the sticks, though!",1460592000,2,976,4.309782608695652
6152904,5,B00HAX3YIA,Love this. I've been doing Pound for over a month at a local fitness center and I loved it so much that I decided I needed to buy the DVDs to have at home and I just tried them out tonight and I love them!!! I did the first disk and man I am sore. They really work you. I highly recommend this.,1459814400,,294,3.6825396825396823
6152905,3,B00HAX3YIA,The workout could have been taught in a more professional manner while still making it fun. The workout itself is very good. Being a group fitness trainer I'm a little picky. Hopefully the next will be better and not use the same warm up and cool down for each workout.,1458864000,2,269,4.4

6152915,4,B00HAX3YIA,"This is a great workout program--sort of like Barre meets Zumba, all about low-impact core and lower body strengthening, but with a rhythmic component that's great fun and adds some cardio work.  Plus it's endlessly adaptable to each individual's skill/fitness level.  I deducted one star because there really isn't $40 worth of product here--it's just one sample each of the four types of POUND workouts (lower body, upper body, core, cardio) with the same warmup and cooldown tracks tacked onto each, so navigating around those becomes a real nuisance if you want to do more than one workout segment back-to-back.

I didn't realize this until it was too late, but you can actually create an account for free at www.poundfit.com and sign up for a 'backstage pass' that will get you a new series of workouts every two weeks.  So you could just buy the ripstix and do that.",1425945600,74,872,4.832214765100671

6152934,2,B00HAX3YIA,Intriguing idea to add drumsticks to liven up a workout but they failed to use them to any advantage. Decent workout but boring.

6152945,4,B00HAX3YIA,"I decided to check out Pound after seeing it was offered in my local gym. Since the cost of the DVDs was less than the cost of a seven week class, I thought this would be the better investment- especially since I wasn't sure if I could survive a 45 minute class right off the bat.

My thoughts after a week of Pound:

The intro was very helpful to watch the first time. They spent time teaching you about the proper positions. If I would have skipped this, I doubt I would have gotten as much out of the workout.

Bassline was a blast! It is the workout meant to target the lower body. I was so engrossed in 'pounding' away and keeping the beat that I didn't fully notice how tough of a workout it actually was! It target all if my 'problem' areas and left me sore for three days. In particular I felt this in my inner and outer thighs, butt, and even the sides of my hips. This one is by far my favorite workout!

Tune-up is the upper body workout, Tune-up was also fun, but much less intense of a workout than Baseline. Maybe this is because I practice yoga and am used to plank positions. It left my arms feeling a tad bit underworked. Because this is the 'lightest' of the workouts so far, it would be a good one to tack on to the end of one of the other three to make a longer, 40 minute workout. It still made for some good cardio though and I broke a sweat. I could imagine that this workout would be more intense if they offered heavier ripstix.

Poundcore is the ab/core workout. In terms of burn, I would say that I got more out of this than I did the Tune-up workout. Due to all of the twists, I felt the burn more in my sides than my abs themselves. This workout took quite a bit more coordination than previous workouts and at a few points, I found myself struggling to keep up. I feel like I have to work a bit more at this to get the full benefit.

Cardio Jam Session is the final video. It is pure cardio. I lived this one! It was challenging but I had fun the entire time and probably emitted buckets of sweat in the process!

I look forward to including Pound into my regular workout routine. I am sure I will also be joining the Pound class after all.",1410134400,118,2170,4.10377358490566

6152948,3,B00HAX3YIA,"I agree with the other reviewers, the music is too quiet! It's hard to really get into it because the music is so quiet in the background. It should be adjustable so you can Rock-out! while working out.  If you up the volume, the voices are way too loud and distracting.",1409097600,4,270,4.294117647058823

6152950,5,B00HAX3YIA,"So, i ordered POUND with little to no expectation, as its following a failed attempt at T25!
IT HAS BEEN AMAZING! The workouts are SOOO much fun that you just forget its a work out. If done properly, results are inevitable! Its SO easy to follow, the new online routines keep you guessing, its not just some boring work out video.. T25 was effective but SOOOOOO boring. I couldn't stick to it because it felt SO much like repetitive exercise.. POUND is the opposite. I look forward to pounding, I am on day 18 and have yet to miss a work out. (WHICH IS HUGE FOR ME!) I recommend anyone try pound; my 50+ aunt also takes local pound classes. Its a solid investment.. I URGE you to try it. It has changed my view on exercise and has me motivated to keep moving! #poundposse",1407628800,5,771,4.324137931034483

I've done them all and love them all!  There's a great ""how to"" intro to Pound on the video, so you'll figure out the moves and techniques in no time.  It took me a couple of rounds to really get into the groove of each workout, but now I'm pounding away and loving it!  The only downside to this video series is that the music is at too low of a volume throughout.  If I turn the volume on my stereo up so that I can actually hear the ""beat,"" the voices of the pound girls blow out my eardrums!

6152960,5,B00HAX3YIA,"I started by taking POUND Rockout Workout classes but the DVD has brought my love for the workout to a whole new level. Not only do the POUND Girls explain proper form and technique in depth, they always show modifications and maintain a really high energy level during the entire workout which keeps me really motivated!!

Combining 2 of the tracks to make a 40 minute workout is what I do but the DVD is great because you can choose how long your workout will be and what to focus on. Bassline KICKS MY BUTT (in the best way), but I think that the Cardio Jam Session is my ultimate favorite!!!!

There's nothing like unleashing some aggression through working out and this is literally the ONLY workout that I've found that does just that. I forget that I'm working out and by the end of it, I'm smiling from ear to ear. I love this program and I recommend this DVD to all my friends.

It's the best stress-reliever and it has done wonders for my body. Not only have I lost weight, but I also feel SO much stronger in my core and my ripsix are making my arms look RIPPED!

6152961,5,B00HAX3YIA,"I have used exercise videos/DVDs since the 70's!  This by far is the BEST!!  The 4 different workouts can be done together for a total body work session or individually!  The music is a fun variety that keeps you moving & POUNDing!!  The work out can also be modified if you are just starting out in your quest to get in shape!  The Pound Pros demonstrate the modifications in every video!  I am extremely happy with the improvements I'm seeing in my core, abs & butt!!!

I initially purchased the videos to work out at my apartment, but also found it very easy to take with me on a recent extended trip to work out in my hotel room!  It was wonderful keeping up with my workouts while on the road!
Wonderful product that I highly recommend to anyone wanting a fun and effective workout!",1402358400,8,787,4.379310344827586
6152962,3,B00HAX3YIA,"This is a cute workout. The girls have an entertaining anti-charisma and screen-printed cutoff tees that scream ""Los Angeles!"" The drumming is an excellent distraction from the workout and hitting things IS fun.
Unfortunately, it's a little less fun when you can't actually hit the floor for fear of angering your downstairs neighbors. I hit my yoga mat when I could, but there were certain positions in which I still ended up needing to hit my beautiful vintage hardwood floors. I'm sure my landlord would be thrilled to know that. I found myself hitting the tops of my shoes or my shins instead, leaving my with dim  bruises and a lot of frustration. I'm sure this would have been a lot more enjoyable if I had been able to really rock out like you would in a live class.
I am returning this product not only because of the noise, but also because of the style of workout. I'm a former drummer with a lot of yoga and pilates experience, so I thought this would be great for me. The drumming is fine, though it was a little hard to get used to the altered way of gripping the rip sticks. What bugged me most was the lack of control. I consider myself a fit person, but the ab workout was so so so fast that I felt like I was flailing even with the the level modifications. I was left with a sore lower back from rotation and exhausted hip-flexors. It's been a week of intense recovery yoga to correct the hip issue and I'm just now feeling normal again. Blame it on bad form, but I didn't feel an ounce of soreness in my abs.
Pound was not my jam. This may be the workout for you. You won't know unless you try it. Just warn your neighbors first. And read the fine print on your lease about your security deposit.",1401667200,27,1714,4.306501547987616
