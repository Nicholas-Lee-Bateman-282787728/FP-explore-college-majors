8349419,5,B0021SGOEU,A powerful movie about those Inuits who were treated in Quebec City for tuberculosis. Culture and language shock were the result of this transfer which could last from 2 to 4 years. Women and children left behind had to fend for themselves. Quite often they died of exposure or starvation while their husbands were being treated far away. Acting is nuanced. Great bonds develop between the characters. A moving film that my university French students really loved.,1437523200,,464,5.038961038961039

8349423,5,B0021SGOEU,"I watched this sensitive film about an Alaskan Inuit Indian who must leave his family and culture in order to seek medical treatment in a French hospital in Canada. A thoughtful hospital staff bring an orphan Inuit boy to the hospital for medical treatment. He also has T.B. but is dying. The protagonist in this film wants to adopt the boy and take him home with him after he is cured. Our protagonist is cured, so is ready to return to his home, but assures the boy he will come back for him. He tells the boy an Inuit fable about a woman married to an invisible Inuit husband. She loves him and wants to see what he looks like. This is impossible as long as the man is living.
He is such a good husband and provides for his wife very well. She is overcome with longing to see him, so she stabs him while he is sleeping. As the man is dying, his wife sees how handsome he is, but it is too late.
She has killed the one she has cared the most for. Our protagonist tells this story to explain how he feels as an invisible native American in a different culture. The hospital is killing his Inuit spirit and culture because the staff do not really understand him or the boy.",1314748800,5,1173,4.1946902654867255
8349424,4,B0021SGOEU,"Seldom seen film that I caught on either IFC or Sundance channel. Story takes place in the 50's and is about an Inuit Canadian that must leave his family in the frozen north where he lives to receive extensive treatment for tuberculosis.  Core of the film shows how the Inuit man struggles with his health, his inability to communicate, immersion into a completely foreign environment, and long term separation from the family for which he is the sole provider for.  This film is surprisingly powerful and really creates a lot of strong emotions in the viewer.  Slow paced but excellent nonetheless.  Beautiful landscapes, great acting, interesting characters, and a compelling story make this movie a hidden gem.",1297728000,5,713,5.068376068376068
