2014166,3,B0001MDP36,"A friend of mine and I saw a sneak preview of this last night, and I hate to report that it was, dare I say it, incredibly disappointing. There wasn't a plot twist you couldn't see coming a mile away. There wasn't a bit of romantic dialogue that wasn't contrived. (Renee Zellweger's character, the best thing in the film, makes fun of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's romantic patter at one point, when he mentions that each moment with her is a ""tiny diamond I carried with me."") And every Southern accent, save Zellweger's, was absolutely horrid.
The film, adapted and directed by the occasionally great Anthony Minghella, is a misfire. A maudlin, melodramatic misfire.
At the point where movie stars turn up in what are essentially cameo appearances, I felt like the film was sorta cheating to try and keep us interested. Jude Law's character Inman encounters them on his travels, and, I swear to God, it felt like Dorothy encountering a new character on the Yellow Brick Road in THE WIZARD OF OZ. Someone new shows up, shows off and disappears. Look, there's Natalie Portman as a war widow! Look, there's Jena Malone as the ferry girl! Look, there's Philip Seymour Hoffman as a minister!
Thus, half of Jude Law's performance is spent being the savior or straight man to a bunch of guest stars. The movie treats him like he's the only story element needed to introduce us to a series of unrelated vignettes.
Though my friend had a real problem with Nicole Kidman's accent attempt in the movie, I must say that Kidman as Ada, when she wasn't spouting romantic cliches in voiceover or trapped in a truly ridiculous ending and epilogue, kept my interest. Her relationship with Ruby Tewes, Zellweger's character, is the most interesting in the movie. The film's at its strongest when the two are working together to keep her family farm alive.
Unfortunately, they're also coping with town villains who show up on occasion to remind us that they're inhuman evil and completely corrupt. (The most evil one is, natch, an albino with blue eyes and long hair so that we'll know he's unique enough for us to blindly hate him.) They kill blindly without reason, whenever a scene requires them to do something hateful. Wouldn't it have been more interesting if they had been layered, human villains? The movie gives the villains basic motivations and then lets them run amok, showing up only when they're required to do acts of evil.
The film shows signs of ambition. The actors are too talented to phone in their performances, yet their characters exhibit surprisingly little depth.
And the romantic dialogue, all the yearning and hand-wringing, is straight out of a Harlequin novel. When you hear one of Nicole Kidman's voiceovers begin (and they start up the first one during the opening credits), prepare to count the cliches and eye-rolling statements.
COLD MOUNTAIN is a historical romance in the vein of TITANIC, overwrought and badly written yet sure to be involving to those who like ""old-fashioned romance,"" no matter how badly done it is. This ain't DR. ZHIVAGO, sadly.
It's not original. It's not different. It's not inspired. It's not even particularly involving.",1071100800,11,3163,4.87012987012987

2014189,2,B0001MDP36,"Review of Cold Mountain
Hot Toasty Rag, December 10, 2017

Civil War fans will find a favorite in the romantic drama Cold Mountain. Yes, theres violence, death, and unbearable tension, but thats what you expect when you buckle in for a movie that takes place during the Civil War! This one has a compelling story, good acting, and very authentic production values, so if you like this genre, its worth it.

Jude Law is a Southern soldier who, after being wounded, decides to risk being shot as a deserter and travel home to see his sweetheart Nicole Kidman. While he comes across helpful people, like Natalie Portman, during his journey, he spends most of his time avoiding the bad guys who are out for his head, namely Ray Winstone and Charlie Hunnam. Nicole pines away for Jude and finds it difficult to manage on her own until the feisty, Southern-clich&eacute;-ridden tomboy Ren&eacute;e Zellweger shows up and helps her. With Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson, Donald Sutherland, Cillian Murphy, Eileen Atkins, and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, you know youll be in for some quality performances, even if the overall aura of the film isn't enjoyable.

The most famous element to Cold Mountain, besides the very graphic sex scenes and Nicole Kidmans needless nudity, is the make-up Oscar it won for Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, who had lost the gold the year before for her tour-de-force performance in Chicago. As a native Southerner, playing the tell-it-like-it-is Southerner in Cold Mountain was not a stretch for her acting abilities, and even though Im sure she was very happy to receive her statue, Im sure she realized it was a make-up Oscar.

Be prepared when you go into it that the movies a very heavy drama, more on par with Free State of Jones than Gone with the Wind. Its pretty upsetting at times, and will more than likely leave you unsettled in the years after you watch it. My brother cites this as one of the films he wishes he hadnt seen, but Im used to the type so I wasn't too phased. Use your own judgement whether or not you can handle it, but by all means, put the kiddies to bed before watching it!

Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to nudity, violence, and graphic sex scenes, I wouldnt let my kids watch it. Also, there may or may not be a rape scene.",1512864000,,2353,4.7153284671532845

2014194,1,B0001MDP36,"Rated PA : "" Pretty Awful ""  .  One glaring anachronism  is the foul language used by a preacher's daughter in the time of the Civil War .  The scenes of torture and near rape are hard to take .
  The movie makes it appear that most of the Confederate war effort was devoted to rounding up deserters .
  It is typical Hollywood anti-war propaganda disguised as entertainment  ----not that the Civil War didn't have its bad points !
  Inman falls in love with Ada for no apparent reason and ends up on an odyssey as a deserter, trying to walk home .  I fell asleep through some of it and at other parts, I got up for snacks .
  A wooden main character,  an unlikely story line, sadistic scenes,  anachronism, pure boredom ...
  The opening scene is a realistic depiction of  a real Civil War battle .  The only good thing I remember from the rest of the show is the scene in which Inman points a revolver at a man who pleads ,  ""  Do no kill me, sir  !  I am a man of God ! ""  to which Inman replies, ""  I have killed many such men in the last few weeks "" .
  You've been warned",1511568000,2,1077,3.976303317535545
2014195,2,B0001MDP36,"The movie had some good moments but was fatally flawed by visual and verbal cliches, extreme characters who were really caricatures, overly-long and rambling structure.  I watched it all the way through just to see how it ended (rather predictably), but it took 3 nights.  I just couldn't tolerate much at one sitting.
Other problems include lack of credibility.  Examples:
1. When the main male character (sorry, the tale was so unreal that names were a bit irrelevant) is wandering home, hundreds of miles on foot, at one point he and another civilian kill a handful of marauding Union soldiers.  They now have the dead soldiers' horses.  Everyone is starving to death, but they don't eat the horses.  And the ""hero"" still has many miles to trudge in the dead of winter, exhausted, with little or nothing to eat.  Wouldn't he ride one of the horses?  In real life, yes.  In this movie, he chooses to keep on slogging on foot.
2. When the main female character confronts an unknown man in the wilderness, she has just fired one barrel of her double-barreled shotgun to kill a wild turkey.  She then fires the other barrel into the air as a warning, and points the gun menacingly at the man, who backs down.  Really?  They both could/should/would realize that the gun is empty and is neither a threat nor a defense.  But of course, this being this movie, they don't/",1511049600,,1366,4.665271966527197

The romance between a single Confederate soldier wounded and tired from fighting and the fancy town gal (Kidman) is a moving narrative throughout the film - unlike the book by Fraser, Cold Mountain that focuses on the soldier and his handy volume of William Bartram's Travels that help him to stay alive from the same vicious militiamen pestering the townwomen, the film weaves the soldier's hardships in leaving his military unit and walking away from the Richmond hospital avoiding the bounty hunting militia's greed for reward money for AWOL or wandering males with the women's own suffereings brought to a dramatic close with Kidman and her soldier-boy meeting on an abandoned road and the soldier nearly facing an alarmed Kidman and her shotgun.

If you had any doubt that Hollywood was stupid, this movie will convince you.

It has some moments. The beautiful Carolina mountains. Philip Seymour Hoffman (what a  loss). You cannot blame Jude Law. One suspects he would rather have been in the real war.

NIcole Kidman also chews scenery, but compared to Zelwiger she is Olivier.  Donald Sutherland's pastor character decides to die peacefully in the rain rather than shoot another scene.

The funniest part (in a bad way) is that there are damn few black people in the movie. When they do appear they are either being served root beer on a tray by Nicole Kidman, or being chased mutely through a corn field and shot.

There is nothing many actors love more than southern accents. It shouldn't be allowed.

2014242,5,B0001MDP36,"Well worth watching more than once. I am often deeply critical of movies. This is in my opinion a masterpiece in every way. That opening battle scene is based on an actual event as unbelievable as it may seem. This is an honest movie. Honest in its depictions of warfare, the physical and emotional costs of warfare, and the mysterious and unfathomable attachments we human develop.",1499472000,3,382,4.803030303030303

2014251,5,B0001MDP36,"A powerful and moving film that can be hard to watch at times, but it gives a different view of the War of Northern Aggression than the one we usually get from the movies. One thing to keep in mind while watching this are the fact that the war was never about freeing slaves, since slavery still existed within the Union during the full course of the war, and some of the very last slaves to be freed belonged to some of Lincoln's own generals. The so-called ""Emancipation Proclamation"" only applied to states at war with the Union (or rather, being invaded by the Union), and as such, was nothing but political posturing. So much death and suffering, and all because Lincoln didn't want to lose tariff revenue that was generated by Southern commerce with Europe. No wonder he is often regarded as the worst president in history.",1491436800,,829,4.608108108108108

2014422,5,B0001MDP36,"A Story of tragedy of love and undying faith........set during the American civil-war.
'Ada Monroe' (Nicole Kidman) and her father move to the town of 'Cold Mountain' 400 miles from their hometown of
Charlestown.
'Ada's' father a revererend (Donald Sutherland) had been told the clean air of Cold Mountain would be of benefit to his
condition.
It is in Cold Mountain that 'Ada' meets young 'Inman' (Jude Law) there is an obvious attraction between the two, however
war is on the horizon before they really get to know each-other he joins the young-men of Cold Mountain as they march off
to war to fight the Yankee's believing it to be a great adventure....reality will be something very different.
'Ada' has promised to wait for 'Inman's' return she writes letters receiving no reply, in truth she doesn't know whether he is
alive or dead but has a blind faith that he will one day return.
The men of Cold Mountain serve with honour in battle, their numbers falling day by day, 'Inman' becomes injured in battle
during recovery he thinks of nothing else but of 'Ada' .....when recovering from his injuries he's had enough of this bloody war,
and deserts.
Meanwhile back in Cold Mountain after the death of her father 'Ada's' life is in a downward spiral, the farm becomes run-down,
she's hungry and penniless, by good fortune a stranger turns up on her property 'Ruby Thewes' (Renee Zellweger) an out-going sole who's lookig for work, not looking to get paid only seeking shelter and to be looked upon as an equal in return she'll help 'Ada' tend the land, 'Ada' will learn much from 'Ruby'
'Inman' has set about the long treck home to Cold Mountain to reunite with sweetheart 'Ada' ....it will be a long and perilous
journey all the time aware that Confederate-Patrols are out there hunting down deserters like himself, along the way he will
meet many strangers, some willing to help some willing to betray his trust.
When his journey is done will 'Ada' have waited all this time for his return or will she have given in to the advances of others
such as the treacherous 'Teague' (Ray Winstone)
A very intense and sometimes moving movie experience with a brutal battle sequence, and indeed many further violent
incidents both at Cold Mountain itself and indeed on 'Inman's' journey.
The film harbours many fine performances from it's star-studded cast-list.
(Been meaning to re-visit this film for many moons) - Well worth a re-visit or indeed a first viewing.",1450310400,,2461,4.82033096926714

2014431,5,B0001MDP36,"I loved the history the story told of ordinary people in extraordinary times. I don't care much for Civil War stories of battles, generals, etc; I like to learn about real people as they lived their lives during historic times. This was and is by far one of my most favorite pieces. The actors chosen give such a great lift to the movie, can't imagine anyone else doing a better job. As good as the movie is, get a copy of the book if you want to really learn how life was for these people, even though fiction, I loved the realness of what anyone in that time frame would have eaten, how is was procured and prepared as well as the inner thoughts that a movie cannot always present.",1446076800,,683,4.2615384615384615

2014434,4,B0001MDP36,"What I like the most about this movie was the storyline and the acting.  There were so many complex characters in the film, it centered around Inman (Jude Law's character) going to war, how that affected him, other soldiers, citizens back home in Cold Mountain, NC and others Inman and Ada (Nicole Kidman) run into. My favorite character in the movie was Ruby (Renee Zellweger), I thought she was mesmerizing to watch and her personal story with her father.  The whole cast was fun to watch though. The only reason I did not give the movie 5 stars was because I thought it was kind of weird how Ada and Inman hardly spoke and barely knew  one other yet they wrote each other so much without a response. I wish the relationship was a little more developed before Inman left for war, but maybe that's how society was back in the Civil War in the south.  Ada was after all a southern belle.",1445212800,,887,4.423312883435583

Director Anthony Minghella deserves credit for the overall quality of the acting, which included one of Nicole Kidman's best performances, in addition to the Best Actor award for Jude Law.

I studied the film primarily to see the work of editor Walter Murch. The excellent cinematography of John Seale helped Murch made this a beautiful film, and to tell the story of the battle at the beginning very well through pictures.

The film is a romance - the story of a refined woman who learns to be tough. An example of a decent story adapted to make a great film. If the ending is a bit clipped, the excellence of the main body of the film makes up for it.",1439856000,4,884,4.771241830065359

I related to the horrors of war, and, in ways, saw the Civil War as I've never seen it before.  I also related to the large love story and to the ""smaller"" ones that run throughout.  If, for nothing else, I rate this movie with a 5 because of its beauty of the landscapes.  No one will leave this movie thinking that war is glory or that deserters from the Civil War were simply cowards.  One aspect I particularly like is the transformation of Ida, played by Nicole Kidman.

This 2-disc, DVD set, 154-minute version is superb. It is the Collector's Edition that has it, all. Including - widescreen format, deleted scenes and a ""Climbing COLD MOUNTAIN Documentary"" within the Special Features. Beginning at the on-set of the American Civil War (1861-1865), this film has three stories, in one movie. A love story, a story of friendship between two women from seemingly different worlds and a story of the COLD MOUNTAIN neighbors coming together, in a time of crisis. Primarily, within a war-torn North Carolina community, that is needlessly terrorized by a small time mob, that cruelly and viciously shoots it's own deserters and even, goes so far as too, torture women that harbor them. Regardless of the fact, that the war is almost over. Rugged and good looking Actor - Jude Law and Actress Nicole Kidman star in the leading roles, but Actress Rene Zellwegger outshines them both..., in her portrayal of the backwoods but lovable, Ruby. Rene's character of the 'survivor' mountain woman was so stellar and convincing, that she appropriately won the Academy Award Oscar for Best Supporting  Actress. She was absolutely amazing, in her role. And, as an added bonus, the cinematic scope of the beautiful North Carolina Mountains is breathtaking and the whole story and the way it is presented, is enthralling. This exceptional movie was so riveting, that it was nominated for 7 Oscars, and rightly so! This is beyond a doubt..., entertaining and an all around, superb motion picture.

2014528,4,B0001MDP36,"WARNING -- PLOT SPOILERS

One often wonders why producers make drastic alterations to perfectly good novels. In this case we have the opposite. Anthony Minghella has taken a poor novel -- one that received unwarranted praise and awards -- and fixed its problems. My review of the novel discusses these problems, most of which are beyond stupid.

http://www.amazon.com/review/R8QM0O3S6JYVX/ref=cm_srch_res_rtr_alt_29

Minghella's fix consists of removing the preposterous events occurring during Inman's attempt to return to Ada. He makes the Home Guard (here a group of psychopathic sadists and murderers) a near-continuous presence, so their contacts with Inman aren't the random events in the novel. And in the ""final showdown"", Inman is still killed, but it's plausible -- and he manages to wipe out the Home Guard in the process. Though tragic, the ending is satisfying and believable (at least within the context of romantic fiction). Inman dies a ""good"" death, not the preposterously stupid one he does in the novel.

The photography and production design are magnificent, the acting less so. Only Rene Zellweger (as Ruby) gives a wholly convincing performance (for which she won an Oscar). Jude Law isn't the passionate suitor one would expect, and Nicole Kidman is (at least at the beginning) rather shallow. (In the novel she comes across more as inexperienced/nave.)

Those who detested the novel might find themselves liking the film.

PS: Whoever did the makeup couldn't find a way to make Kidman and Zellweger look plausibly unwarshed. Throughout the film, they look as if they had access to a secret stash of Camay.",1426291200,,1629,5.294573643410852

2014543,4,B0001MDP36,"I was a little late to Cold Mountain, but being that it was set during the Civil War, I don't know that it matters when you see it.

All in all, it was another sweeping (but not as much as others) recounting of the Civil War and what it did to the country and the people who lived there. Not being a Civil War buff, I don't know how accurate it is, but I did enjoy the interesting setting of North Carolina as it was a divided state at that time...the concept of being unsafe in your own home is an unsettling one that was explored in heartbreaking realism by this movie.

Although a little contrived in it's plot details (unwavering true love despite any real substance, the neat ending, etc.) Cold Mountain delivers a punch that you only wish was as beautifully true in actuality.

A worthwhile movie.",1425686400,2,803,4.375838926174497

2014577,5,B0001MDP36,"Quite honestly, I was ambivalent about this film when I first saw it on the big screen. I'm not quite sure what changed (possibly my maturity level), in well over a decade later, but this time around I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated Cold Mountain.

Quite frankly, there's something for everyone here. Epic war battles, sweeping love story, hard struggles for survival, deeply-etched friendships, unvarnished depictions of the atrocities of war, beautiful landscapes, sometimes haunting and eclectic musical score, and, surprisingly enough, interspersed  with very earthy humor throughout.

In retrospect, it's a masterful period piece.

The performances are all rock solid as well. I used to be iffy about Nicole Kidman, but the more roles I've seen her in over the years has changed my opinion completely. She's an underrated, extremely talented actress...and she's spot-on as the lead, not always sympathetic, character here who goes through a major transformation. Jude Law is also surprisingly raw and moving and effective as well. And Renee Zellweger steals the show with a hilarious, spirited performance which gives much needed comic relief to the otherwise heavy tones of the movie. Plus she's the perfect foil to Nicole Kidman's character.

If you're in the mood for a truly satisfying saga on all levels, this will fit the bill.",1422921600,,1342,5.311320754716981

Cold Mountain did not win an Oscar, despite several nominations for acting, screenplay, et cetera - a testament that the Academy Awards folks do not recognize what is great. Nominations are not enough for this classic historical love story.

First thing that raises it above the average is the absolutely beautiful cinematography. This story transcends the time, the space and events, this is the story of Odyssey coming to Ithaca, but far from being a commonplace it rises to became an archetype. The pace is great, maybe a bit slow, but that slowness lends itself well to the overall sense of loss of time and unending waiting. Combined with mesmerizing images, it creates rarely seen atmosphere of longing and futility. Acting is top notch, but the Oscar went to the only one that might have been a tiny bit over the top and not really fitting the rest of it.

Based on a most excellent story, the movie doesn't disappoint.  The casting is perfect.  All the characters have perfect chemistry from the start- I believe every character to be completely real and every set to be authentic.  I am carried away into another era, another culture, another way of life.  This movie manages to make you feel, well, everything, passionately.  Passion is exactly what one feels as the two lovers experience that one incredible kiss before Enmen (spelling?) goes off to war.  It is the promise of what will be.  Not one piece of clothing has been removed, but they swoon to their knees- and we swoon to ours.  I so wish I could go back in time and convince the author of this book to make the ending turn out differently!  But it can never be so... sigh.  I will just sit and nurse my broken heart.

2014915,1,B0001MDP36,"As a fan of the magnificent book by Charles Frazier, I was horrified at the miscasting of this movie. Think of To Kill a Mockingbird,  in which the casting was so irrevocably right, so perfect, you enter the world of Atticus Finch & Scout and are forever changed by the experience.  This movie disregards the heart and soul of one of the best books ever written about the Civil War & the carnage, grief, despair, & courage of the broken souls who endured it.
Here is the author describing the main character, Inman, and what was left of his thoughts after a terrible, gruesome battle...
""...for he had seen the metal face of the age and had been so stunned by it that when he thought into the future, all he could vision was a world from which everything he counted important had been banished or had willingly fled.""

2014992,5,B0001MDP36,"I need to stop reading reviews.  It only serves as a reminder of how stupid our society has become.  ""Too much bad language."" Stop renting anything with a rating higher than PG13...better yet, stick to Nickelodeon.  ""Sex scenes are too explicit""  Again, the story was set during a war.  How is sex affected by war?  Well, reunion after separation promotes some pretty frisky stuff.  That is the nice side.  Now there is the rape.  Again, it's set during a time of war.  If such scenes bother you, stick to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

I am sorry for being so insulting but, it just makes me question intelligence when someone rents, or buys, a movie with a rating higher than G and then complains about bad language or criticizes a movie dealing with a horrific topic (e.g. war) and complains when content appropriate to that topic is included.  That is the equivalent of renting ""Gettysburg"" and complaining about too many people being shot.  Save your less than sophmoric reviews and give a good movie an overall rating it deserves.

This was an excellent movie.  The characters were developed well.  It was a bit slow in places, but I think the pace was consistent with elements of the story that needed to be slow.  The acting was outstanding and the cast...wow!  I was initially attracted to this film because of my love of civil war books and films.  It ended up being a love story, but a wonderful one set in a wonderful way.  One reviewer called this movie a ""chick flick"", a label which I never really liked.  That being said, I am more of a ""moron flick"" kind of guy.  I like it when things blow up and there is absurd violence.  Despite these shortcomings of mine, I am still going to highly recommend this film.  It is a good one.",1405036800,,1739,4.517684887459807

Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are excellent, Natalie Portman is fine (I love her) but perhaps misplaced, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland do a fine job, but the standout for me was Renee Zellweger's stunning performance. She's captivating. The whole thing works well but for some reason just stops short of really hitting home. I would actually make it more towards a 3-1/2 but again, Renee's performance is definitely worth it, and the movie in total is worth watching for sure.",1404864000,,596,5.03030303030303

Do you desert, or do you stay? If your children become deserters, do you harbor them and risk losing all you have? When you lose your father and nature turns to a harsh cold winter, and you have no visible means of doing the farming by yourself, as a woman, how far would you go to stay alive?

2015041,5,B0001MDP36,"This is the cinematic achievement of a lifetime for the actors as well as the screenwriters. This is a deeply emotional, sweeping tale of love, endurance, betrayal & fidelity. It's a historical morality tale that tells the intimate, on the ground story of the civil war and grounds it in an understanding of the social, political and economic realities of the time and place. It's heartbreaking and captivating and, in a way that you will not understand until you see it (or read the book), also profoundly redemptive.

2015053,5,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain is a story that probably has happened 1,000's of times in real life.  The time is the American Civil War and with the prospect of adventure, excitement and patriotism, young men rush to join the ranks of the Union and Confederate troops.  This is a story about a town that sent it's sons to fight on the side of the Confederacy.  A man named Inman, played by Jude Law meets Ada, portrayed by Nicole Kidman, a young lady newly arrived to Cold Mountain.  They fall in love and Inman leaves for the war.  Parts of the story are told through letters written by them to each other during war.  Inman decides to return to his home and his love even though the war is not over.  This is their story.

2015062,4,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain can be quite a slow slog at times.  Essentially, we have our hero, played by Jude Law, suffering every kind of abuse as he fights his way back towards his love, played by Nicole Kidman.  To ease some of the pain of this 3 hour quest, we are treated to a lot of nasty buggers from both the Yankee and the Confederate sides.  More importantly, however, we get to watch both the Law and Kidman characters undergo some dramatic personal transformations.  I was disappointed--though not surprised--by the ending.  You would think that after all of the suffering that Law & Kidman went through, there would be some kind of decent reward for such loyal faithfulness to each other.  But alas, I guess that would be the old, ""typical"" type ending that today's film makers shy away from lest they be labeled as ""predictable"" or some other horrific title.

Good movie if overly long.",1403136000,,886,4.67741935483871

The letters we have between great grandparents courting during that time are respectful while the unwritten was the fear and longing, memories of a stolen moment kept close by both to keep the faith. The movie represented many such postal relationships that expressed love and hope while in a war that promised neither. It's that lifeline that matters in every conflict and keeps us human in an inhumane situation.

Perfect acting and direction, along with the attention to detail, made a beautiful movie.",1403136000,,652,4.821428571428571

Every actor was so good at demonstrating the effects of the war at home and how ruthless men always think they can take anything they want without consequences. We see it everyday on the TV news. The love story was very moving, between man and women, daughter and father, love will move mountains as it is the one strength God gave us.

While a lot of people say they had a momentary attraction, I was under the impression that they saw each other somewhat often over a few months and developed feelings for one another, but the movie doesn't really make that clear.

There were some excellent actors, and the two women main characters were really great, but the end just was pointless.  I turned to my husband and said, around 15-20 minutes before the end of the movie, ""I think everyone must die, or close enough.  There isn't enough time to do much more than that and resolve everything left unresolved.""

For heaven's sake, not everything in the South needs to pour like thick cold cane syrup. I'm from here. Get on with it already! Then there's Nicole Kidman. I'm a fan of hers, but in this role she bungles everything. Her accent is awful and she's too old to play the virginal ingenue.  Jude Law does a better job with the accent.  Renee Zellweger is also a ""performance eyesore"" -- too clearly just playing a part. And I'm a fan of hers also.

2015129,5,B0001MDP36,"Even though the Spring Semester at Spartanburg Community College is over, I plan to use certain clips from the movie, ""Cold Mountain,"" in some of my future US History classes.  In this case, the one area which stands out would be the battle sequence at ""The Crater.""

There could be a number of reasons for choosing FIVE STARS for ""COLD MOUNTAIN.""  One which stands out, is that it is a historical drama centered around 'The War of Northern Aggression.'  Southerners, especially those on the home front, had a number of problems to address, one of which was basic survival.  The second reason, as a period piece, can be seen in the style of clothing and customs depicted in the film.  The third reason, is that the film is very close to reality for the pressures placed upon the average Southern soldier, who realizes that one's family needs him at home, as the South is beginning to fall apart.  These soldiers knew the consequences of being caught, and that in itself was not pleasant.  But, there was that strong pull of family and loved ones, which is depicted in the film.  Then, there was the music which had that down home southern mood, as well as the soundtrack.  Enough said.

Basically, I liked the movie because it was a beautiful historical period piece.  At the same time, it had a moving story centered around two lovers who were caught up in the historical events of the time.  The scenery and sets were beautifully filmed and depicted in the movie and helped to set the mood or atmosphere of the 'Old South'.  But, the period clothing and events, which were fairly accurate, was a welcome addition to movies about the 'War Between the States.'  Now, was that 'The War of Southern Secession' or 'The American Civil War'?  Anyway, to me it was a very good historical period piece.

I highly recommend this video.  The movie (VHS) COLD MOUNTAIN allows for one to see other aspects of what people had to
endure on the home front.

My adult daughter watched the DVD before I had a chance to and told me it had some very disturbing scenes. After watching the DVD on my own I have to admit that it does have some very disturbing scenes. This is not a family video and it should be rated NC-17 not R. This is not something the kiddies should see. The well done battle depictions are very graphic and realistic  on the level of Saving Pvt. Ryan only atmospherically darker. Mans inhumanity and brutality to man (women) is on open display as well as sexual depravity. The movie begins with a bloody Battle of the Crater during the siege of Petersburg, Virginia in late 1864 and ends with the death of the protagonist during the winter of 1865 in the mountains of North Carolina with nothing light in between.

This novel my Charles Frazier follows a confederate solids as he makes is way home to a small town in North Carolina called Cold Mountain.
The book is a fascinating depiction of a morally bankrupt Confederate soldier who only wants to get home to the woman he has carried in his heart throughout the ordeals that he suffered as part of some of the Civil Wars greatest battles.
This is a boo that makes the reader spend a good amount of time thinking about the realities of war, the loss of innocence and the the very real cost of war on the individual story.

This a particular relevant novel in that the main character is suffering from PSTD (Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome"" at a time in our counties history where that particular illness  could not even be imagined. When an author can take an event that occurred in the mid-19th century and make it relevant to a disorder that has only been recognized within the las quarter of a century, well, the author has delivered an outstanding piece of writing.

This movie captured not only the horrors and devastation of war, but revealed the personal human sacrifices made through lost of life, home and family. Before the war, one young couple, briefly meet and, through their innocence, share a moment that becomes the heartbeat and pulse throughout this movie. After several years have passed with no word or contact, it is that ""one moment""  that keeps (Nicole Kidman) pining away for Inman's (Jude Law) return. And It is that one moment in time, that relentlessly compels his determination to get back to her.

2015178,5,B0001MDP36,"I found this movie to be one of the best written and directed for this particular subject that I have seen in a long time.  The acting was superb.  Jude Law was nominated for an Oscar and rightfully so.  He did an outstanding job in his role as Inman.  I was especially  pleased by Ren`ee Zellweger's acting.  The story following a man who must leave the woman he has fallen in love with to fight a war he does not want to be a part of speaks of that particular time in our history.  People who watch this movie as just entertainment do not understand that these things happened in the civil war.  Very young men were forced to fight and die for a cause they did not understand or believe in.  The progress of Inman after he decides to make his way back to Cold Mountain, North Carolina is at times riveting.  At home, Ada ( Kidman) must keep her hopes alive that Inman is still alive and will come home to her.  As the war turns what was once a comfortable lifestyle into poverty she is joined by a rather strange character ( Zellweger) who helps her bring the small farm back to life and made it possible to survive.  The added truth to this war of men who stayed behind to kill or enslave men who did not want to serve or as Inman did, leave there post as the war became an obvious lost cause was hard to watch.  How men could be so cruel and arrogant was disheartening.  The end left me very sad except for the one happy surprise at the very end.  I hope everyone who reads this review will purchase this movie and enjoy the gifted actors, writer and the excellant directing of Anthony Minghella.  I promise it will not be a waste of your time.",1381190400,2,1648,4.2006369426751595
2015179,5,B0001MDP36,"This is a comparative  critique of Charles Frazier's novel Cold Mountain and the film of the same name. I saw the film when it was first released and it was a gem of a movie. Recently I read Charles Frazier's novel and found the book to be significantly different from the film.

The basic outline of Frazier's story forms the core of the movie but the love story between Ada Monroe and Inman is very different in the novel. The magnetic attraction between the two drives the movie and provides the emotional tension that keeps the viewer alert, almost like a mystery plot. Will the two survive to meet and live happily ever after? Charles Frazier's novel does not use that tension to drive the story.

The first scene in the book is set in the Petersburg hospital and Inman's motivation to desert his regiment after years of loyal service is his disillusionment with the war. Ada Monroe does not enter his thoughts by name until he is well on his way home. The reader puts the two together when the author makes Ada the subject of the next chapter but she, too, is not consumed with longing for Inman. Rather, Ada is occupied with growing up and surviving after her father passes away. When Ruby Thewes enters her life midway through the chapter Ada's attention centers around her relationship with the capable and earthy young woman.

Well past halfway into the novel Inman finally reveals that when (and if) he meets Ada Monroe he will declare his intentions right away and, if he is rebuffed, he will turn back around and keep walking. For her part, Ada only thinks of Inman during quiet moments of solitude and is not sure he is still alive. Whether or not they will live happily ever after - or even meet again - is only inferred by the structure of the novel. Even if I hadn't seen the movie first I would have expected that conclusion but it is not uppermost in the minds of the characters.

Both the book and the movie, then, are beautiful depictions of the same story as if you had heard alternate versions of a story about a neighborhood couple from two trusted friends. The various vignettes that the film's fans know well are mostly all different from the book. The various Home Guards are not half the antagonists in the book as they are in the movie and Captain Teague has no back story, no motivation, in the novel.

Inman, Ada, Ruby, Stobrod and Reverend Monroe are all finely drawn characters and everybody else, including even Esco and Sally Swanger, are background figures. Inman's journey is not so much Homer's Odyssey in the book. Anthony Minghella  used the Odyssey as a concept for the film before he wrote the screenplay, as he relates in the Extra Feature interview. The human interactions of the vignettes provide the constant motion that contemporary filmgoers expect but in the novel the geography, the weather, the wildlife, the food and Inman's solitude are all virtual characters in a way that would have ground the film to a halt.

The movie has all that exquisite cinematography and an excellent soundtrack written by Gabriel Yared. The period music is well researched under the experienced guidance of T-Bone Burnett. The extended version DVD includes the feature, ""The Music of Cold Mountain"", which I highly recommend. One surprise for me was the writer of the song, ""My Ain True Love"" - Sting. The mysticism of Ada's vision from Sally's well is an invention of screenwriter Anthony Minghella. That minor sub-plot serves to create a subtle tension and a gentle resolution at film's end but Charles Frazier did not intend Ada's vision in the well to be a plot device.

To me, Jude Law fit Charles Frazier's portrait of Inman very nicely and Rene Zellweger was a perfect Ruby Thewes. Every other face fit nicely into Frazier's characters except Nicole Kidman. She was fine in the movie but I do not think Kidman would have been Frazier's pick had he been given the choice, not the way he drew Ada Monroe in the novel. Read the book and see if I'm right. Who would you have rather seen as Ada Monroe?

*Update for Civil War buffs:

Inman was probably a member of the 49th North Carolina Infantry. Charles Frazier does not identify Inman's regiment in the novel but the 49th was everywhere Inman was, including the first regiment north of the South Carolina brigade that was the victim of the Petersburg Mine explosion. They were also in the thick of the fighting at the Battle of Weldon Railroad later where Inman received his neck wound in the book, as opposed to the movie where he was wounded in a night skirmish a few days after the Battle of the Crater.

Then there is a problematic scene in the movie after Inman deserts. He is seen walking on a beach with his right shoulder towards the water - walking north, but that's not the real error. For a Confederate deserter to leave Petersburg from the hospital he would have had to go west toward the Danville Road then turn south. Access to the Virginia coastline was controlled by Yankee troops in 1864. In the book Frazier never traces Inman's route on a map but he never wrote a scene involving an ocean. An appendix in the novel mentions the reference book North Carolina Troops in the Civil War as well as Charles Frazier's extensive hikes in the Blue Ridge Mountains of southwestern Virginia and North Carolina so any historical inconsistencies are a fault of the film, not the novel.

Is the story an anti-war parable? I do not think the novel is anti-war so much as it is historically accurate. After Sherman captured Atlanta and siege warfare settled on the Army of Northern Virginia the fate of the south was sealed. Many North Carolina soldiers deserted in the winter of 1864-65 so Inman's decision would not have been unique. This is just the first fictional story to give voice to those deserters as opposed to the ill-fated men who fought on to Appomattox and had their stories pass into legend. And Inman was still a formidable warrior on his journey, several times engaging adversaries that outnumbered and outgunned him but still he came away victorious. Frazier's story and Minghella's film tell a mostly overlooked tale about the people of a conquered nation and how they dealt with the lives they were forced to live. That is not anti-war, just reality as it was in 1864.",1381190400,4,6279,4.661246612466124

I love the relationship which develops between Ada and Ruby as they work together to keep Ada's farm going during the end of the war.  Dealing with the home guard in their county is very realistic.  The way Ada and Inman make it through their own trying times, both heavily relying on the memories of their short courtship right before Inman left with the forces.  Rene Zellweger is outstanding in her role as Ruby Thewes.  I highly recommend this movie for the acting as well as the musical score.",1379289600,,585,4.420560747663552

Well, come to find out that Renee received an Oscar for her performance and there's a reason for that - she was fabulous!  So were Nicole Kidman and Jude Law.  For the first time ever I can't decide which I like better, the book or the movie.  I have decided to love them both equally.  Movie was beautifully shot and Philip Seymour Hoffman has a great secondary role also.

However, I finally caught this several years after it came out and loved it as well.  The story is timeless and even if the film falters here and there from a bit too much cornpone, the actors somehow manage to make up for it, especially Jude Law.  He should have won Best Actor.  Great performance.  Still, everyone was pretty wonderful from the leads on down. The film captures eloquently the tragedy of the Civil War and the destruction that it wrought on the souls of those who endured it.  Natalie Portman was equisite as a young woman with a sick baby who took in Inman, revealing her character's painful loneliness and need just to be touched and physically comforted after losing her husband.  In fact, there are numerous moments when the story takes on great power and captures the awful absurdities of war, like the battle scene in which union soldiers literally dig their own grave by setting off underground explosions at the rebel line, finding themselves unable to climb out of the hole they've created and greatly increasing their own casualties.  I think it's a film that benefits from repeated viewings and deserves a place in the pantheon of civil war films that transcend their subject.",1376092800,,1317,4.720524017467249

2015238,5,B0001MDP36,"Note: I saw this film in HD via XFinity On Demand.

The acting in this movie is first-rate, and the drama is very well sustained. Nicole Kidman & Jude Law do very credible American accents, and Renee Zellweger rightly won Best Supporting Actress. There are other good actors in smaller roles here as well, including future Oscar winner Natalie Portman. The cinematography is beautiful, and the score by Gabriel Yared is lovely.

Sadly, there is one profane use of God's Name, and that's 30 minutes towards the end of the picture. Why do film-makers feel the need to profane God's Name in a movie? ""Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain."" That is the only fly in the ointment for me concerning this otherwise swear-free motion picture.

2015239,5,B0001MDP36,"This a wonderful story about horrible times in U.S. history.  We see the American Civil War from the point of view of Southerners who who fought for the South, but, more importantly, the point of view of those who were caught up in it through no fault of their own.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman were superb.  Natalie Portman turns in one of her strongest performances in a supporting role.

Now, hold on the your hat as Rene Zellweger is the hurricane sure to blow it off.  Where she got all those explosively fun and weirdly zany characterizations we'll never know.  I'm willing to bet that she surprised herself the first time she saw the finished film.  But it's down there and she dug it up for this movie, and we are all more seasoned by her display of true acting talent, the kind of acting that you just can't see.

It's a wonderful film.  The story is compelling.  The cast of characters, including Philip Seymour Hoffman playing a really hateful scoundrel, is superb.

The story moves back and forth between his considerable challenges and Ada's as she attempts to survive on a farm in troubled times.  Raised as a protected minister's daughter, she is totally unprepared to be self-sufficient.  Fortunately for her, a drifter named Ruby shows up.

2015363,2,B0001MDP36,"Unlike a lot of the reviewers here -- who had problems with the casting, the acting, the slow pacing, and the paper-thin romantic premise -- these things didn't bother me, because the story otherwise had a reasonable structure and flow, and I was curious enough about ""how this will resolve"" to keep watching.  But then what finally happened in the ""resolution"" was so utterly predictable, in the sense that it's something that would happen only in a HOLLYWOOD MOVIE, that it ruined the rest of the film.

Here's the underlying problem -- when the Civil War starts and most of the men go off to fight in the Confederate Army, some men stay behind and avoid the battles, presumably because they are older or too young or for some other reason.  But almost immediately, those ""stay behind"" guys begin making snide comments to the soldiers and the townspeople like, ""OH, DON'T WORRY, WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE WOMEN WHILE YOU'RE AWAY.  HEH-HEH-HEH.""

And so you can predict, right there, that these ""stay behind"" guys will become the typical gang of mindlessly ruthless murderers and rapists and robbers, who will pillage the innocent townsfolk as soon as all the other men leave for battle.  And of course, that's exactly what happens here -- a pack of five or six of them roam around the town and the farms and either threaten to kill people without mercy, or actually DO kill them and torture them, often for no apparent reason, even enjoying their brutality, etc.

Okay, fine.  Let's just say that this ""roving gang of murderers"" premise is part of the story.  It wasn't that unbelievable under the circumstances, with all of the righteous and high-minded menfolk having gone off to fight in that oh-so-noble activity called WAR, after all.  But then you have Nicole and Rene, who are left behind, living in a HUGE farmhouse, all alone, and who KNOW (as their neighboring farmers know) that the roving band of murderous thugs is roaming the countryside.

So what would anyone do in that circumstance, where the PRIMARY DANGER in your area is not the war itself, but the roving band of murderers?  Obviously, the innocent townspeople and farmers should band themselves together, and arm themselves to the hilt in defense against a possible attack by the roving gang, right?  But no, that would make too much SENSE -- and this is a HOLLYWOOD MOVIE, after all.  So what the people stupidly do instead is continue to live separately, relatively defenseless, and just kind of HOPE that the roving gang leaves them alone.  Huh?

At one point, Rene's father even comes back from the war along with two other male friends, finding Nicole and Rene in the farmhouse, but instead of all of them defensively banding together in case of an attack by those roving murderers, what do they do?  They all separate.  ""Oh, you three men go and stay somewhere else, like out in the woods, or in a cave or something, and just leave us two women here in this six-bedroom farmhouse, by ourselves.""  Huh?

Then when Jude finally comes back from the war and reunites with his long lost love, Nicole, what does HE do after a sexy night with her?  He sends her and Rene back to the farmhouse, to be all alone again (and in a rather ""happy go lucky"" manner, no less) while he goes off on his own.  HUH?

HOW, HOW, HOW can these characters have forgotten that, uhhh, there's kind of, uhhh, like, uhhh, a ROVING BAND OF MURDERERS OUT THERE, RIGHT NOW, and uhhh, like, uhhhh, this means that they could all be, uhhh, BRUTALLY ATTACKED at any minute, and RAPED, TORTURED, and MURDERED?

I mean, how many HOLLYWOOD MOVIES have this same old and completely stupid scenario -- there's a totally known, totally obvious, totally life-threatening danger confronting a group of people, and how do they respond?

""Okay, let's all split up and hope that nothing bad happens to us.  Ha-ha-ha.""

So as Nicole and Rene merrily saunter down the road, by themselves, guess what happens to them......within SECONDS?

They are surrounded by the roving gang, of course -- and hilarity ensues.

Is there some Hollywood filmmaking school where they are REQUIRED to teach writers and directors to create wholly cliched, predictable endings like this?  Doesn't anyone think for a minute how stuff like this undermines the entire film and insults the viewers?  Doesn't anyone realize that the story itself needs to establish a baseline credibility, so that the viewer can suspend disbelief and buy into the premise?

The second half of it got considerably better, right around the time that Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellwegger's character) showed up. I think Ruby really stole the show, the movie became a great deal more interesting and relatable with her in it. Renee Zellwegger won the best supporting actress academy award for her portrayal of Ruby Thewes and I think it was well-deserved.

2015394,4,B0001MDP36,"As is often the case when I go back and look at movies that I hadn't seen in a while, I find little nuggets that were missed and annoyances that I overlooked.  Such is the case with this multi-Oscar nominee.  Directed and written by Anthony Minghella (""Michael Clayton""), this film is another version of his ""The English Patient.""  I would suggest that if you liked that movie, you'll like this one.  If not, I doubt you will like this either.

Jude Law is very good (Oscar nom.) as Inman, a simple carpenter in a small North Carolina community who meets Ada (Nicole Kidman), a newly transplanted preacher's daughter.  The sparks fly but the mores of the era suggest slow going and before you know it, Inman is off to war to fight the Yankees before any chance for courting take root.  Minghella doesn't shy away from the violence as Inman's Confederates engage in ferocious battles with the Union army.  Wounded and hospitalized, he decides that his longing for Ada is too much and heads back home at the risk of being caught for desertion.

The film flashes back and forth in dream and real time sequences with Ada's developing plight when her father dies and she is unable to cope with hard work.  This is where Renee Zellweger enters the story in her Oscar winning performance as Ruby, a hard working woman ""as good as any man.""  The town now devoid of young men is being overtaken by thugs headed by local land baron Teague (Ray Winstone) who has eyes on Ada and her land.

Meanwhile, the most interesting part of the film is the journey of Inman as he walks back home.  Starving and cold he comes upon a cast of characters that add spice to what could be a tired middle section of the movie.  The best of these is with Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a local reverend who has impregnated a young black slave.  Better still, and for my money the real ""best actress,"" is with Inman and Sara played with a remarkable combination of poise and sorrow by Natalie Portman.  Living in a one room cabin in the wilderness, she has a newborn and has lost her husband to the war.  Inman shows up on a rainy night, in need of shelter and food.  Reluctantly, Sara allows him in and lets him stay in a corn crib that is attached to the cabin.  Inman, in love with Ada who remains the driving force behind his journey isn't out for any hanky panky.  Besides he's too tired.  Sara isn't looking for sex but is clearly lonely and in great despair so asks him to share her bed, ""but that's it,"" she says.  They do and it is, but she breaks into tears longing for companionship.  A truly heartbreaking scene.

Ultimately Inman finds his way home and back to Ada, but the movie continues with the outcome still uncertain.  In reality this is pure Hollywood ""Oscar bait"" to be sure.  It has monumental production qualities including beautiful North Carolina scenery (Oscar nom. For cinematography), great music (Gabriel Yared & T-Bone Burnett), fine acting and ...Nicole Kidman's beautiful blue eyes.

The latest Blu ray version is in 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  This is a significant high definition upgrade.  I found nothing troublesome.  The transfer is honest to the original film.  The audio is a DTS-HD MA 5.1 which is also of reference quality.

This version blows away the cruddy looking DVD. Unlike the cheaply made import blu rays of this title, this version is true 1080p (where the imports are 1080i).

2015419,5,B0001MDP36,"This movie is another sweeping saga of love, loss, and light in the hemorrhage of the Civil War era.  If you are a fan of this type of movies, then this is definitely for you.  The cast is particularly well thought out while it continually adds more actors as the movie plays through.  Including the appearances of; Renee Zellweger (Oscar winner), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Kathy Baker, Natalie Portman, Jena Malone, Giovanni Ribisi, Jack White (in a particularly great acting and musical performance), and so many others that I couldn't even make room to mention them all.

This picture brings us to Cold Mountain, North Carolina, named after the Indians who lived there first.  It is a community in itself full of friendly southern people with a colloquialism all their own.  Heavy on regional folklore and music, the town is in need of a Pastor. Enter Donald Sutherland and his devoted daughter Ada (Nicole Kidman) who quickly meet the town's people through Sally (Kathy Baker).  This meeting is on the roadside while coming into town from Charleston. Ada has the opportunity to meet Inman (Jude Law) who is helping to build the new church for the town.  All eyes are riveted on shy and demure Ada, as she appears as a porcelain doll to them.

Inman, a man of 'few words' although with an abounding heart, is captivated by Ada as she is with him.  They meet and start a relationship that really only consists of a few meetings.  They don't share much in communication through spoken words but are able to become deeply and strongly in love with each other. As the rumors of civil war are spreading through Cold Mountain, the men and boys are readying themselves to ""go shoot themselves some Yankees"". This is very distressing to the Pastor and especially to Ada as she knows that her beloved will leave her for war...But what of his return?

The call is brought out while in church one Sunday morning and all men are excited as they run out, except for Inman who is trepidatious about Ada's feelings.  He reassures her and goes to his rooming house to put on his uniform while Ada brings him a book to take along. The two have exchanged their tintypes and share their first kiss while all of his fellow soldiers are shouting all around him to hurry up and ""kiss her for me"".  With all the romance of the time, Inman goes off to war with a longing look on Ada's face which beckons him to 'Come Back To Me'...

There is much content involved in this movie and so many things that happen in the duration of the war years.  The health of Ada's adoring father is threatening and they have just had their ""last cut of meat"".  Ada has been raised by him to support church life and within the finery of the day.  Being a typical southern belle, she becomes isolated after letting the ""slaves"" have their freedom and refuses to hold them there. Ada is starving and in dire need of help to run the farm on her own.  She has left longing for Inman through the upcoming years never knowing if he will return, managing a farm and newly obtained life that she is ill-prepared for.  Ada is alone as the beckoning begins ...

2015420,5,B0001MDP36,"If I had to choose my favorite character in this film it would definitely be Ruby (Renee Zellweger). From the moment Ruby appears and rescues Ada (Nicole Kidman) from an aggressive rooster, cranks his head around until you hear a squawk as his neck breaks, to the end of the movie, Ruby is a delight, and was a great part of what made this film so terrific.  Ada was the perfect contrast to Ruby's take-charge, can-do attitude.  I've read some criticism of Jude Law's performance, but I thought his ""Inman"" worked out quite well, as did the supporting actors such as Ruby's father and his friends.  Of course there are ""bad guys"" in the story, but since good guys usually prevail in a good story, their skulduggery is dealt with in the end.

While this movie is characterized as a Civil War movie, there's very little of the war in it.  A scene or two of what I believe was the Battle of the Crater at Petersburg, is all I recall.  Other than that, the violence is pretty much confined to a few short scenes.  Most of the story is about the woman left behind and how Ada and Ruby survived a difficult time period in our national history.  Both women have their victories. For Ruby, it is a reunion with the father who abandoned her as a child; for Ada it is the eventual return of the man she loves.  Since I'm one who loves happy endings, this story/film ended in a way not expected, and not as happy perhaps as it might have been.  Yet the final scenes were about love, family, friendship, children and acceptance. For Ada, Inman will be always young, strong, and forever protecting her.

2015423,2,B0001MDP36,"2 1/2 hours of instruction (with illustrations) in how badly behaved adult males can be when unchaperoned was way more than I signed up for.

Problems with the film:

1. Way too long.

2. The unattractive Romanian locales bear no resemblance to the Smokies. I had to suspend my disbelief, as it were, for the obvious disconnect. I'm guessing, based on the somewhat acerbic commentary at the beginning of the movie, by the late Anthony Minghella, that the Romanian venue choice was due to budget considerations. (It also provided grist for the London tabloids' later reporting of the Jude Law/Nicole Kidman brouhaha.)

3. Given the low moral estate of many of the male characters, it beggars belief that the evil ""Teague"" would have limited his interest in Kidman to mere ogling. Serial rape would have been Kidman's fate in reality, no matter what the late Mr. Minghella might have imagined.

4. The upcountry North Carolinians were not rabid supporters of the Confederacy as they were portrayed in the movie. Many, in fact, wanted to have nothing to do with the war. They were, and still are, an independent lot. What else would you expect from Scotch-Irish?

5. The final shootout was disappointing. We waited 2 1/2 hours, and we got--a dead Jude Law and a pregnant Kidman? In the infamous words of Serena Williams (Forest Hills, 9/11/11): Come on!",1315785600,,1350,4.873362445414847

Unfortunately I was unable to stay awake to see the ending, so a few weeks later I rented it and watched the entire movie.  I absolutely loved it. It is amazing, just beautiful. The characters' struggles teach a life lesson that life is a gift, not a given, and it can be taken away at any moment.
  The ending was so terribly sad, I cried and cried.  I even found myself thinking about the movie days afterwards still feeling the overwhelming sadness. Inman had the will to survive the war, he used all of his strength both physically and mentally to make it home to Cold Mountain.  He came so close to death a number of times, and yet the light that kept him going was Ada. The ending was so sad for me because it really showed how cruel the world is.  Inman made it through a treacherous journey just to senselessly be shot and killed.  The only glimmer of hope that Ada had was taken away.

2015445,2,B0001MDP36,"There's so much wrong with this film.
For starters: Minghella doesn't ever have the scene where Ada and Inman FALL IN LOVE. Doesn't matter if it's a 10-second scene, there has to be something, anything. The way Ada ... what? The way Inman ... what? Drinks a glass of tea? Plays the piano? Something. But no, there's nothing.
Second: too many stars. Anytime there are this many A-list actors they get in the way of each other. Ribissi's act is getting real old; so is Hoffman's. Come to think of it, we didn't need Portman or Sutherland either. (Though who can ever qualm with the great Ray Winstone, who disappears in a role better than anyone save Toni Collette. (Have they ever been in a picture together? Can anyone tell?) Winstone's so good in this I still can't figure out which character he played.)
Three: Jude Law. Bad casting, and he wasn't very good.
Four: Departing from the book where there was no need to, especially -- I think I'm getting this right -- re: Inman's killer. In the book it wasn't the evil, blond-haired guy, it was some young'un hiding in the bush that, incredibly, got the jump on Inman. Which made it all the more surprising. (Kind of like Omar getting it in The Wire from that kid in the convenience store.)
Five: Zellweger's just-give-me-the-Academy-Award-already performance.
Six: not enough of Inman alone, by himself (think Jeremiah Johnson); seems every day he was running into somebody -- another A-list actor.

There are just too many stereotypes and storybook leaps here. The man is a perfect paragon of honor while simultaneously portraying a harlequin romance combination of the strong silent type and the bad boy. And the waiting Nicole Kidman tries to bridge incredible faith with a peculiar madness, but it doesn't work and she's just a stereotpyed Southern Belle in lace.

Renee Zellweger's character is the one bit of promise, the one point of interest here, a strong woman and peppy eccentric, and as the musicians appear on the scene, the film pricks up for a moment. But then the bad guys show up and it disappears back down the hackneyed hole of predictability and emotionl vacuity.

2015472,5,B0001MDP36,"2003's ""Cold Mountain"" tells the story of Confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law) who deserts after the Battle of the Crater debacle to return to the mountains of Western North Carolina and his one true love, Ada (Nicole Kidman). Inman experiences many different people, events and obstacles on his long journey home, while Ada has her own problems to deal with -- someone's death, the BEG (Blatantly Evil Guy) who has taken over the town with his ruthless cohorts, starvation/poverty, a house and farm she doesn't know how to run, that is, until Ruby (Rene Zellweger) comes along and gives a hand, and more.

As you can see, the film essentially tells two stories that ultimately intertwine. The plot is reminiscent of Homer's Odyssey. In light of Inman's long journey home the film is episodic in nature but thankfully never loses its sense of cohesion.

The story shows how the war destroyed or corrupted the South on practically every level, not just the soldiers who went off to fight, die, be maimed, desert or suffer defeat, but everyone left behind as well. Every person Inman meets on his journey is somehow damaged or corrupted because of the war.

For example, in the case of the family in the large cabin (which also includes the wife's two lonely sisters) the husband's friendliness is a greedy and deceitful ruse to make money off the deserters. All the eligible men have gone to war and those who return are maimed and scarred. Is it any wonder the women are love-starved and try to lose themselves in drunkenness and casual sex?

As for the overt sexuality of that sequence, I think the writer and filmmakers were attempting to contrast the drunken carnal lust of that scene (including the two sisters upstairs with the looney guy) with an intimate love scene later in the story.

The scenes noted above, particularly the former, are very adult-oriented, so be forewarned. This sequence and the immoral and looney ""Reverend"" Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) may tempt some tune out and judge the film as unwholesome or even ""anti-Christian"", but this is a premature judgment in light of the entire story and particularly the ending. Not everyone can handle ""Cold Mountain"" because of its hardcore depiction of the horrors of war, madness and immorality, I understand this, but it's not all death, misery and darkness; these are effectively balanced out by the beauty of life, love, loyalty, companionship, poetry and music.

The film was shot in Virgina, South Carolina and the Carpathian Mountains, Romania, the latter of which are good stand-ins for the mountains of North Carolina.

""Cold Mountain"" runs 2 and a half hours and it's just a very well done film on every level, in many ways great. Don't miss out if you haven't seen it; and if you have, be sure to give it another look -- it's worth it as it's full of treasures to mine on repeat viewings.

2015491,4,B0001MDP36,"It's very easy to enjoy `Cold Mountain'.  In fact, I think that it would be hard NOT to enjoy it.  The film really contains nearly everything needed to make for an entertaining and thrilling and memorable ride.  The storyline in engaging (even if some have noted it runs a tad `false'), the acting is enthralling (even if certain performances don't hold up as well over time), the cinematography is spellbinding; everything from the feel to the look to the tone of this film is designed to satisfy your every cinematic want and need.

So, it's safe to say that I thoroughly enjoy this film.

Having read the novel (long after I saw the film), I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the novel was adapted.  Yes, there are changes (as will nearly every film adaptation) but with a novel that is so packed (stuffed you may say) with many characters and encounters and situations, it would have been easy for this film to lack fluidity.  It would have been easy for this film to feel claustrophobic and detached.  I was astonished to see that `Cold Mountain', the film, almost fares better than `Cold Mountain', the novel.  Anthony Minghella superbly crafted a film that carries a lot of weight yet never feels overly stuffed or too compact.  There is a breathy airiness to this film that helps create a fluid movement from scene to scene.  Despite the onslaught of characters and drastically separate situations (the story, in both written and cinematic form, is told in a very episodic manner) the film is very easy to follow.

The story is a seemingly basic one; that of a soldier who goes awol in order to return to his love, a wealthy and sophisticated young woman.

Some have balked at the unrealistic nature of Ada and Inman's love affair.  They barely knew one another and seemingly had nothing in common and yet we are expected to believe that they long for one another so drastically that they risk all (at least Inman does) in order to be with each other.  I think that this line of reasoning is rather simple.  This story is not really a love story in the typical sense.  I don't think that either Inman or Ada truly LOVE one another in the sense that they have formed everlasting and genuine emotional connections with each other, but I do believe that each party represents a better life and future for the other.  They are both longing to develop that connection, and to be freed from their apparent prisons (both very different yet both very much the same) and so they see in the other a chance to believe in something bigger than they are.  They are not risking all for each other, but in stark contrast, they are risking all for themselves.

For me the film has rarely a flaw.  The script, while truthfully a hodgepodge of events, contains the atmosphere of pure storytelling and thus remains completely engaging and rewarding.  The performances for the most part all still hold up.  Jude Law is so moving and so heartbreaking as Inman.  He really understands how to convey his character's desperation without stripping him of a soul and making him a walking shell.  Small supporting roles from names like Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson and Ray Winstone are all superb, and the string of cameo performances by big names like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi and Jena Malone make their mark quite nicely.

I still feel that Nicole Kidman was sorely miscast and that her empty and emotionless portrayal of Ada dampened the films overall emotional connection.  She seems to come to life when Renee Zellweger comes on screen, but it is her `coldness' (near stagnancy at times) that makes her longing for Inman hard to swallow.  Renee Zellweger is the focal point of ongoing debate over her zealous (overly so) portrayal of free-spirited Ruby.  I admit, she is entertaining, but over the years I too have found her performance near cringe-worthy.  It is not very good to be honest, and while it never fails to entertain, I fear that it is entertaining for the wrong reasons.

Which is why I strongly feel that the supporting actress Oscar should have gone to her co-star Natalie Portman.  You know how they say that good things come in small packages.  In merely 5-10 minutes of screen time, Portman devours the entire film with her intense, believable, heartbreaking, strong and mature portrayal of a lonely and scared woman doing all she can to survive for the sake of her child.

AMAZING.

In the end `Cold Mountain' remains a very good film.  It suffers, for me, in the afterthought because it lacks a strong emotional surge.  It reminds me a lot of Minghella's other epic `The English Patient'.  It is beautifully staged, acted and scripted and yet, when the dust clears, it is strangely forgettable.

This film was totally miscast in every respect. First of all in Frazier's novel the southern appalachian mountains of North Carolina were as important a character in the book as the human characters were. So what do the producers do? They film it in Romania in a location that only bears a slight resemblance to one of the most beautiful mountain ranges on earth. For those of us who intimately know the landscape of The Great Smokie mountains such as myself, this is the first great disappointment. There currently exists about 40% virgin wilderness that still appears much like it was back in the civil war time of the novel. But they chose Romania instead where there is not a mountain laurel , tulip poplar or rhododendron bush in sight. Do we feel like we are in the southern appalachians... NO! Then there are the actors. Nicole Kidman is so wrong for the part of Ada I could cry. Her southern accent is weak at best and she reeks hollywood. Think Cate Blanchette instead. Jude Law with his pretty boy face falls flate on it as Inman. I would have rather seen an actor like Damien Lewis of Band of Brothers cast instead. His slim continence and the thousand yard stare that he perfected in that powerful WW2 epic would have fit nicely with the horrors Inman had witnessed from Sparksburg to the nightmare of the Petersburg crater. And lastly there is Renee Zellweger as the mountain girl Ruby. Her inept performance is pure comic characature and the final nail in the coffin of this poorly realized film. If you want to see a movie that actually captures the atmosphere and gritty feeling of civil war times in America, I would suggest the low budget gem Pharoah's Army.

Were there no American actors available to take on these parts? Not surprisingly, neither Kidman nor Law could effectively nail the accents, which made an already trite, poorly executed love story even more painful to withstand. As is frequently the case with Nicole Kidman, you get a self-conscious, contrived performance rather than a reliable and convincing portrayel of a definitive character with true dimension. As is also frequently the case with her movies, the casting agents deftly placed a reliable supporting actress in the film to counteract her obvious weakness.

2015521,5,B0001MDP36,"I loved the book and found the movie just as good, which is unusual.  The Battle of the Crater [not in the book] is especially good--awful, really.  Confederate armies on the verge of defeat are blown to Hell by an underground mine.  Well-fed, well-trained Union soldiers advance into the breech only to be mowed down by the famished, desperate and shell-shocked survivors.  Courage beyond the bounds of courage.  The battle ends with mutilated Federal corpses piled up like cord wood...it's not a cinematic invention...it happened just this way.

The rest of film is excellent, too, but certainly far from perfect.  The home guards, chasing down disgruntled soldiers and run away slaves, are just too evil for words.  As a matter of fact, they are just too evil for reality.  Slaves were valuable and deserting soldiers could still serve in the collapsing Confederate armies. Wholesale murder wasn't in the cards.  At the same time, a film needs villains but sometimes villainy is more effective if handled more delicately...with more subtlety.

Still the film worked for me, especially the enormous tragedy of women--impoverished, grief-stricken women--waiting for men who would never return...waiting for men who would never again plough a field or make love to them again.  Multiply Ada by hundreds of thousands and we start to get a feel for the unfathomable tragedy that was the American Civil War.  620,000 men never came home...more than all the other American wars put together.  The South was especially devastated...most of her military aged men were dead or crippled while, simultaneously, the Federal Government exacted full revenge on the flattened South.

Hey!  It ""unified"" the nation or was the nation's disunion just internalized?  By the way, I'm a Southernor and wasn't disturbed by ""fake"" accents.  It's been going on long before ""Gone with the Wind.""

2015524,3,B0001MDP36,"The novel COLD MOUNTAIN was one that took the world by surprise. Not a book that some thought would find an audience, it became a hit and spawned this film as well. And it is one of the most romantic, although brutal, films to come along in some time.

The story takes place at the beginning of and throughout the years of the Civil War, Young Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) has moved to the town of Cold Mountain with her minister father (Donald Sutherland). There, she meets and falls in love with a quiet man named Inman (Jude Law) and we are off and running on a rocky romance.

The couple never has the time to court as most do when word of war erupts and changes their world forever. Inman sets out to fight and not until the last moment before leaving do the two have the chance to let each other know that there is more going on here than just minor attraction. Inman heads out with the knowledge that Ada will wait for him until his return.

It is these words, along with a book she gave him and the three letters he receives that keep Inman going. Through the killing and battles around him, including that of Petersburg. Inman sees the folly of war and the loss of those around him. Wounded in battle, he is sent to a hospital to recover. Changed by all he has witnessed, Inman deserts and heads home for Cold Mountain and the woman he loves.

While this is going on, we are brought into the story of Ada as well. Her father passes away and she begins to lose hope. Unable and unknowledgeable in the day to day means of living, she depends on others to help her. One sends along Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellwegger), a self sufficient up front young woman to help. Not only does Ada begin to change in what she learns and how she deals with the world, Ruby offers a character with more depth than is revealed on the surface.

The ladies resurrect the farm and Ada's way of life. All of this takes place under the watchful eye of Teague (Ray Winstone), a ruffian who once owned the land Ada now possesses and who wants it back. Teague and his men are now the law of Cold Mountain, placed in charge of hunting down deserters first and foremost.

The movie follows two separate paths, one the literal one of Inman as he travels and meets all sorts of people from a randy minister (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to a young woman (Natalie Portman) with a child whose husband was killed in the war. Each episode of what Inman is witness to brings images to mind of the Civil War that many are not familiar with.

Ada, on the other hand, makes her own journey, trading in the somewhat pampered life she had led before as a young woman for the world of a woman who must tend to learning how to live life on her own should it come to that. With no men and slaves now a thing of the past, only Ada with the help of Ruby can survive.

Along the side is the story of Ruby who deals with her past, including her father (Brendan Gleeson) who left her to fight. He returns with a two friends and they are welcomed back, though not quite with open arms. And now that they are deserters as is Inman, the shadow of Teague must eventually fall into place.

The paths that these lives take is one that moves slow at first, but builds to an ending that is both romantic and tragic at the same time. It seems that all literary romances end in some sort of tragedy (thing back to TITANIC, a movie that I felt contained nothing of the heart that this one does). And this tale does so as well, though where that tragedy comes from I won't share here. Instead, watch the film, keep a box of Kleenex handy and enjoy a story of America's past. And while anti-war to an extent, it does not do so with a holier than thou attitude. The actions and images seen say it all.",1205366400,3,3736,4.243319268635724

Of course, the soldier finally makes it back more than two hours later, only to die in his lover's arms when shot by some Confederate vigilantes.

The strength of the story (to me) lies in the fact that it illustrates all the ambiguities of the Civil War, particularly the home guard units and vigilante organizations that were so prevalent in the South.  This war was a great hardship to the ordinary yeoman farmer who was not a large land owner and slave holder.  The movie also pointed out that support for the war in the mountainous areas of the South was weak at best.  People in those regions served more because of State loyalty than any passionate issues or independence.  This is an extraordinary movie by every measurement.

2015541,3,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" (2003) tries to be The Odyssey told during the Civil War -the story of a man on his way home to his eternal love and all the obstacles and tribulations he faces. There a lot to admire in ""Cold Mountain"" - Anthony Minghella sure knows how to make a good-looking film with great views and impressive cinematography. This and his previous films, ""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" are the good examples of his craft. The war scene in the beginning of the film is very impressive - realistic, powerful and violent. I did not read the book, so I can not comment on what parts were left out but the love story between Inman (Law) and Ada (Kidman) did not touch me very much. I am not sure if it has to do with the story itself or with the performances of two main characters but they were overshadowed by the supporting characters played by Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Kathy Baker, and Giovanni Ribisi. Some of them had only few minutes of screen time but their characters are interesting and alive. Renee Zellweger received all possible awards that year for her turn as Ruby, funny looking but strong, energetic and independent woman who had helped the helpless and lonely Ada to manage her farm after her father died. I liked the character but I was not too impressed by Zellweger's performance. I think she had overplayed and made Ruby too grotesque. I've seen four Oscar nominated performances from 2003 and I liked two much better than Renee Zellweger.

There is a very frank love scene between Law and Kidman in the end. It is the well made scene but too beautiful considering that two lovers went through the nightmares of war, starvation, disease, and the lack of any decent conditions. I saw on the screen two very attractive people in great shape with sexy bodies but not two lovers of Cold Mountain during the devastating war.",1188432000,4,1909,4.681547619047619
2015542,3,B0001MDP36,"I'm not quite ready to join in dismissing this version of the best selling novel Cold Mountain as a ""big-budget chick flick"" but I will say that I'm one of the few women I know who wasn't captivated by this movie. (Not many men I've talked to about it liked it, and mostly said that was because it needed more Civil War battle scenes, which I agree it did.) What was good about Cold Mountain was its visuals, which were often very nice. What was wrong with Cold Mountain had to do with its slow moving plot, and the intolerable extent of its departure from realism. The morality here was cartoon-ish and straightforward good versus evil, no line of gray between, and its love story was the fluff of razor-thin romance novels. I also thought the characters were broadly-drawn stereotypes who somehow exuded shallowness (that mortal sin of the fiction world) despite the many over the top moments they were all given. Dyed in the wool fans of the actors who make up the cast of Cold Mountain will probably always enjoy this film, and it's great that they do, but for the rest of us, I'd advise that expectations be kept low.

2015545,5,B0001MDP36,"I saw many potential pitfalls going into Anthony Minghella's 2003 epic ""Cold Mountain"". One, Anthony Minghella directed the film. He's the chap who lensed ""The English Patient"" back in 1996. I never saw that movie, but what I'd heard and read didn't sound promising. A schmaltzy romance set during World War II? No thanks. Two, ""Cold Mountain"" stars Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, and Renee Zellweger. Ugh. I can't stand Kidman and her pinched little nose. I also don't care much for Jude Law, an actor trying to set the world's record for the most movies made in less than five years. And Renee Zellweger? Forget about it, baby. An actress known for appearing in chick flicks and romantic comedies, Zellweger's presence in this film signaled storm clouds on the horizon for this viewer. I'd rather rip my fingernails off with a pair of pliers than watch a Renee Zellweger picture. Third, and finally, I heard that the central element in ""Cold Mountain"" is a romantic entanglement between Kidman and Law. Again, let me utter a hearty 'Ugh'. I looked at the film's runtime, 154 minutes, and blanched in horror. No way am I sitting down for two and a half hours to watch two performers I don't like make kissy faces at one another.

""Cold Mountain,"" set during the bleakest hours of the American Civil War, follows the various misadventures of two characters, Inman (Law) and Ada Monroe (Kidman). The latter moves to the small town of Cold Mountain, North Carolina to care for her ailing preacher father (Donald Sutherland). To say that Ada is a fish out of water in this tiny village is an understatement. She knows nothing about farming, the economic engine that fuels Cold Mountain, and her outfits and manners are woefully out of place in the sticks. Nonetheless, she soon strikes up a rather odd relationship with the grubby Inman. The two never say much to each other nor do they spend much time together, but it's definitely a case of love at first sight. Before the two can form a more lasting relationship, the war rears its ugly head. All the young men in Cold Mountain-- including Inman--can't wait to take up arms for the Confederacy, and he soon marches off to fight the Yankee invaders. As millions of young men throughout history have discovered, however, war isn't all its cracked up to be. After Inman nearly dies in a terrible battle, he decides to desert and head back home to Ada.

Inman's journey home assumes epic proportions as he encounters all sorts of odd characters and life threatening scenarios. He runs into a shifty chap by the name of Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), helps carve up a dead cow, narrowly escapes doom at the hands of Junior (Giovanni Ribisi in a performance one simply must see to believe), and protects a woman named Sara (Natalie Portman) from Yankee depredations. Everywhere around him lurks violent death and temptations of the heart, yet he continues his journey home to the lovely Ada. Speaking of our young heroine, she's also fallen on hard times. The sudden death of her father leaves Ada in dire straits. Complicating matters is a local thug with designs on her property, a thug who also happens to head up a vigilante squad. Monroe nearly starves to death until a local sends over the loquacious Ruby (Zellweger) to help bring the farm back to life. This young firecracker knows everything there is to know about agriculture, and in no time the two strike up an unlikely bond that provides the film with many humorous situations. As we shift between these two parts of the movie, we wonder whether Inman and Ada will ever meet up again. And if they do, what happens next?

I think that's enough summary to convince you that I watched the movie. I know I said I wouldn't, or couldn't, view this picture, but I forgot to take this out of my online movie queue and ended up watching it anyway. I'm glad I did. I still didn't care for the romantic angle, and I'm still not much of a Kidman or Law fan, but imagine my surprise when I came away from ""Cold Mountain"" with much admiration in my heart. Why? Three reasons. One, Zellweger hits a homerun as the spunky Ruby. She's a real hoot and steals every scene she's in. Two, the battle sequence involving Inman and his compatriots took my breath away. I can't remember the last time I saw such a gritty, harrowing portrayal of warfare. It's dark, bloody, grim, and deeply disconcerting. There's even a scene where an explosion literally blows a man's clothing off his body! Now that's realism, folks. The battle sequence alone would merit five stars. The last reason is the movie's depiction of agrarian America. For most of our history, our country was an agricultural nation. ""Cold Mountain"" really captures this America, and does so with a great eye for detail.

For those three reasons, I'm giving ""Cold Mountain"" five stars. Minghella's picture really is an epic journey through a dark time in American history, and such an epic deserves an equally epic DVD treatment. The two-disc set I watched contained an informative (read: worth listening to) commentary track with Minghella and editor Walter Murch, mucho deleted scenes, and several lengthy featurettes. ""Climbing Cold Mountain"" takes us behind the scenes to show us every aspect of the film's production. ""A Journey to Cold Mountain"" comes across as one of those promotional features Hollywood uses to sell a film. ""Words and Music of Cold Mountain"" is a concert featuring some familiar faces performing the film's score and reading sections from Cold Mountain the novel. A few storyboards, trailers, and a four minute featurette called ""Sacred Harp History"" round out the set. ""Cold Mountain"" is a winner, an excellent film that stays with you long after you watch it. Highly recommended.",1181779200,5,5756,4.799395161290323

2015558,2,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain, a place in Western North Carolina is no fun. Life is harsh for country farmers, and cold-blooded locals.  Sure, it's beautiful to look at through the mist as long as you're not starving to death, being raped, or murdered.  I thought I'd let potential viewers know ahead of time before they think they are going to see a romantic period piece for chicks: Cold Mountain is brutal with violence and sexual abuse.  Most of the offending scenes are unnecessary for the telling of a ""Saga.""  I have no idea why Minghella felt it imperative to show Hollywood blood and skin every other scene.  Well, I know why.  The director has these fantasies and he wants everyone to understand.

A saga is a long story of adventures and side plots that finally climax in a truth so ironic that audiences can't sleep at night thinking of the terrible drama and unrequited love.  Think Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, or Gone With the Wind.  Speaking of GWTW: isn't Cold Mountain kind of a crude remake of that chestnut.  For the most part, Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and especially Renee Zellweger are awful with their dialect; in fact, they are all over the language map, and these inflections kill those moments of human suffering, erupting a giggle to the viewer's throat.

I wonder if the relationship between Zellweger's can-do Feminism and Kidman's old fashioned Southern Belle is a commentary or debate that didn't actually take place for a hundred years.  Feminism is an outgrowth of birth control and Socialism.  Empower the woman and there'd be no war.  All would cooperate as women do as workers.  Men are beasts etc.  You see what I mean.  None of these ideas pounded upon by our screenplay and director would come to fruition for a Century, so why not try to get with accuracy a slice of history.

Recreated, The Crater, a true debacle of history is truthful to a point, but after the Union soldiers are trapped in the hole, did the Confederates jump in too?  I read Bruce Canton's account, and I can assure you the Confederates fired down into the pit with no need for hand-to-hand combat.  The same may be said about the National Guard portrayal.  Films about the Civil War give the impression that every able-bodied man joined the army.  This was not true.  Legions of men stayed home and society itself, law and order, remained for the most part.  Now I won't argue with oral history.  If somewhere in North Carolina, the locals became abusive to their own people: so be it, but CM makes the villains cardboard without character development, so I was left with cheap prurient emotion.  I felt the need to bathe.",1155686400,6,2625,4.701754385964913

I didn't expect much - I DO NOT like Nicole Kidman (I find that she has a mean face) and I am not really a great fan of Renee Zellweiger or Jude Law. But I was pleasantly surprised and even more - carried away. This is the kind of movie you do not see so much this last time, the kind of stuff that Hollywood mostly stopped to make in the end of 60's. I almost had the impression that the ghosts of Bette Davis (""Jezebel"") and Vivien Leigh (""Gone with the wind"") were watching Nicole Kidman with approval and a friendly smile - it must be the first movie in which I almost forgot that I can't stand her.

The story is REALLY GOOD. And sad - sometimes almost unbearable. The acting is great, the visual aspect of the movie even better. The introductory sequence (battle of Crater) is amazing. Renee Zellweiger gives a great performance (the best in the whole movie). And then there is the incredible Natalie Portman, in an episodic but very memorable role.

A cornicopia of  scene effects, ranging from  surreal, to tragic, to tongue in cheek, to implausible (with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre?) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest, although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks.  Speaking of implausible - The friendship that ensued  between the red-haired minister and Enman, in light of their initial conflict, seemed rather far fetched and silly, moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a Broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times. Renee' Zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in Jerry MacGuire. Nicole Kidman was not in her element, yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present. This film was over-starred and substantially miscast. Didn't need Donald as Kidman's father and Kidman and Zellwegger's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary. Overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault. Undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved.",1153008000,4,1938,5.3618421052631575

An incredible depiction placed in the Civil War this beautiful tale of love and war, friendship and agony, joy and loss captivate every one of your senses.

The love story between Inman played by Jude Law and Ada played by Nicole Kidman is romantic, poetic and heart wrenching.  Showing what happens to each character separately serves this movie well.

2015564,5,B0001MDP36,"I will admit it is hard not to watch any drama placed in a great American historical context, and Cold Mountain is no exception.  It is a great love story, a story of the insanity of war (cursing all metal that makes blades and guns; or as Ruby says, men make rain, complain when the skies grey and it rains and they're soaking wet--a metaphor for war).

Every viewing shows more and more subtlety and this is first-class from having Mr. Daniel Troiani as uniform consultant to the haunting echoes of the original soundtrack supervised by T-Bone Burnett, including the fantastic fiddling or ""newcomer"" Dirk Powell of Louisiana and arrangement by the great Ralph Stanley, to the correct use of an Italian mandolin (rare in 19th century American pieces--such as ""Wild Bill"")....to an earthiness that apparently only the country of Romania could provide--and did.

As for the brutality of war--any film cast against such a backdrop must portray it, and if we wish to avoid such things they must be portrayed--but this is not tasteless (being reminded of Dog Day Afternoon when it first was released), and a love story of this type (a romanace of years based on little encounter between a man and a woman) is typical of the home front in the Civil War, when whole towns were decimated of their young men in their prime--to the extent of some being completely abandoned after the conflict.

Nicole Kidman portrays not a Southern Belle but a conflicted daughter of a minister whose first ""productive"" work of a lifetime is building a fence on her deceased father's property with Renee Zellweger, who turns in a meritorious performance from start to finish--the Falstaff of a tragic story from start to finish.

At the end--when young Inman is killed by a home guardsman in a duel fueld by the ""confidence of youth"" versus the experience of Odysseus...(one does have to wonder how this young guardsman escaped concription)....if you don't feel the brunt of heartsickness over the inhumanity of man to man (which of course would have led you to stop viewing)...you simply cannot relate to the truly human dimensions of a great film.  There is no underlying subtle theory here, such as in ""The Damned"" which attempts to explain Nazism through Freudian theory...no, this is a great love story, an American story told against the backdrop of great American history, and for that I can find no fault--except the appearance of Kidman's black corset in the only love scene--where did that come from?  A bit of an unnessary distraction at that particular poignant moment.

2015565,4,B0001MDP36,"Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) and her preacher father come to live in Cold Mountain, North Carolina, just before the start of the Civil War.  She is attracted to the shy, handsome Inman, (Jude Law), and he to her, but before they can speak what is in their hearts, he is off to fight, with just a tintype of Ada to comfort him.  She endures the rigors of the homefront, aided by mountain girl Ruby (Renee Zellweger); together they survive Yankees, the local militia, and hunger.  Inman, meanwhile, has seen the horrors of war, and after three years, decides to go back to Ada and Cold Mountain.

The trailer for ""Cold Mountain"" led me to believe this was a romance, but it is really a story of the brutality of war.  The gory battles and scenes of unspeakable cruelty away from the frontline are almost endless and it takes a strong stomach to watch it all.  Kidman is fine as the Southern belle turned self-sufficient farmer, and Law gives a remarkably sensitive performance.  Zellweger's earthy Ruby is a welcome relief from the depressing action.  Watching this movie leaves one recoiling from the inhumanity that was common at that time.  It is a thoughtful, sobering, bloody story.",1145232000,4,1183,4.7317073170731705

The story is a good one and the book by Frazier is very good, but in its movie form it seems really depressing.  I thought Kidman was very good and Zellweger was great, but I really did not like Law as Inman, he just did not register, it was hard to understand why Kidman longed for him so.

2015567,3,B0001MDP36,"The Cons:
Perhaps the biggest problem with this film: editing. This film could have been about at least a half an hour less in duration.  The first forty to fifty minutes of the movie are a bit lethargic and not essential in terms of building the relationship between Ada and Inman. I tend to concur with the reviewer who said that she contemplated turning it off during this time. Some of this time could have been better spent developing the two main characters. This lack of development is confounding considering that is the crux of the entire story. Their ""love"" seems to be a little wooden, put together like a quick science project, and you would think for a movie that is two and a half hours they could have done a more decent job intertwining this into Inman leaving for the war. Although the two lovers seem to be inspired by each other, there is nothing that suggests they should, considering they barely know each other. However, alas, the movie does improve.

The Pros:
The latter half of the film, which entails Inman's attempted return home and Ada's dealings with her homeland, definitely are worth the ride. Inman continually keeps his survival in tact with the sole thought of one day seeing Ada, and Ada, despite many of the townspeople's beliefs that Inman is dead, wants to hope that he will one day return to her. Ada does not know whether to belief in the sign that she sees in the well of Inman's return.

Renee Zellweger does a commendable job as Ruby. She brings a breath of fresh air to this movie, and comes just in time to the slow start. Not only this, but she really is the basis for Ada's character to gain strength in hopes of seeing her lost love come home. Ruby and Ada are complete opposites, and yet, by the end of the film, you realize how critical they were to one another's physical and mental survival.

Overall:
One of the more prevalent themes of the film is the importance of hope and faith in times of crisis. Every major character has to believe that things will improve at some point, and has to do this when something in their life has become a struggle. With Ruby it is her life with her father that she attempts to comes to terms with. As far as Ada and Inman, they must learn to go on living and existing despite the possibility of never seeing one another. The true testament asserted within the film is overcoming and enduring in life's trials.

2015568,5,B0001MDP36,"OK. Let me begin by saying that I have not read the book which I feel sure  gives me a better ability to review the movie based purely upon conveying its merits without being biased toward the novel. I understand that 99% of the time a movie can't hold a candle stick to the book. Many times the complexities and intracacies do not translate well to the screen, what movies should strive for and are good at doing, however, is conveying the mood and ""sense"" of the times. That is what I feel Cold Mountain does very well. Yes, perhaps the story doesn't follow the book and Renee Zellweger, Natalie Portman, and Nicole Kidman are to beautiful for their own good, but they do convey the the feel of the South in the late 1800's even if this is an idealistic tale. The story occurs in period of history when the South is being ripped apart and the graciousness of the people would swiftly be carted off in the succeeding years in favor of more ""modern"" principles of individualism instead of commnity and sharing.  Not every Southerner was ""bad""; war hurt everyone as the movie shows, evil knows every race and all sides. On other fronts, the movie's ""emotional core"" that was supposedly lacking is completely misjudged by critics. In addition to be idealistic this is a romantic tale, one in which everything does not have to be rational; indeed love is not always rational. Inman is a quiet man -  his feelings are communicated through actions and looks. Is one always compelled to fill up the air with words to innumerate love for another? Many people, especially women, are intuative in this way- just like Ada. In short, I loved this movie, its ebb and flow weave like the poetry of a lost time as Inman meets various characters juxtaposed to each other on his journey home:fallen preachers and kind neighbors; musicians and easy women. Mingehlla leaves us with this poetic sensory overload to work out in our minds many hours after the lights have come up. Yes, it's a blockbuster and all that implies, yet, very occationally, even the blockbusters get it right. It's my firm belief this is one of those times.",1140825600,7,2113,4.629333333333333
2015569,3,B0001MDP36,"Many films try to be the next Oscar contender. It's almost as if a director who wants one decides ""I'm gonna do a period piece with a love story and stuff"". That was the feeling I got from Cold Mountain, a would-be Oscar contender if it wasn't for the basic idea of the film and also it plays out like ""and the next cameo is..."". While it's not a bad film, it's definately something that could've been something better.

The film centers around 2 main stories, 2nd of which comes later. Inman is a soldier in the Civil War who had an incredibly brief romantic encounter with Ada. Getting wounded, he breaks from the hospital and tries to get back to her, meanwhile being hunted for deserting the war since you're supposed to fight in it. Ada strikes a friendship with Ruby who turns Ada's failing farm around. And there you have it: a journey movie with new people on one hand, and a girl buddy movie on the other.

It's quite a credibility stretch even with powers of love. At one point, Inman runs into a single mother and there is that option to stay with her yet he goes off to Ada. Why? They really only shared one kiss. We have to basically agree that these 2 were meant for each other and that's the end of it. I wouldn't go that far. At least films like Titanic and other romantic movies have the person gradually falling for them, not in a split second.

I wasn't kidding when I said ""name that cameo"". We have Donald Sutherland, Jena Malone, resident Paul Thomas Anderson repeats Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Melora Waters, Giovanni Ribisi, Brendan Gleeson, even Jack White of the White Stripes is here and surprisingly he's not that bad. Of course the standout is the single mom played by Natalie Portman. Great at playing that willing to support herself and protect her baby but also just needing someone. Just too bad she drops out just like everyone else.

Unlike the overlong English Patient, Cold Mountain in a way deserves its lengths. Lot of bases to cover and the extra time allows the characters to develop. It's just too bad characters drop out as fast as they introduce them, one of which literally doesn't last 2-3 minutes. Most of the time we don't even know their names it's just ""hey can I walk with you? Blargh, I'm dead"" and on to the next one. So it's just like the film itself: we're supposed to care about the epic war and love story setting yet it feels kind of hollow.  It's like ""oh we were supposed to cry and be moved? I didn't know that"".

Where the film shines is the main leads. Each actor is more than capable in their part with Renee Zellweger ending up winning the Oscar which I can understand although her accent can grate at times. But for some reason casting really attractive people and having them all scarred and muddy seems out of their range oddly. As if they don't belong in that dirty war savaged world which isn't their fault really. Natalie is an attractive actress but seeing her in dirty rags or in a red carpet dress isn't distracting.

A football jock tries to win the college dean's daughter so he pretends to be debonair and ""James Bond""-esque but we know the truth. Similar is Cold Mountain, a good film but no Oscar winner here.",1138838400,4,3189,4.459691252144082

This movie is, essentially a remake of ""Gone With The Wind"", which, when considering the amount of killing, is extremely boring. Cold mountain is equally boring, no one I have met was able to stay awake through the whole thing. After viewing this movie, I am sure you will wish it was gone with the wind. However this, unfortunately will never happen, considering, as I have heard from unreliable sources, that both the house and Senate have passed an amendment illegalising the destruction of this movie. I have also heard that it is the favorite movie of both Hillery Clinton and John Kerry. The box claims that it is in English, but most of the characters seem to be speaking an obscure dialect of ancient Sino-Tibetan Xiang Chinese. I am told that this is only due to their ""southern accents"", but I am very skeptical of that. The characters also cry too much, and win academy awards for their poor acting in doing so.

2015582,5,B0001MDP36,"There have been many movies told about the Civil War.  However, few of those movies have focused on the backwater towns that provided many of the men who fought and died in that awful conflict.  This movie does exactly that.  The focus is on two average people in a small community that is quite likely to be similar to many other small communities across the United States at that time.

Jude Law is Inman, a rather shy man who is smitten with Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), the daughter of new minister Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland).  Ada is very sheltered from the realities of life and enjoys many of the smaller luxuries available to genteel Southern society.  All this changes when the Civil War begins.  Inman goes off to fight in the war, and her father dies.  Now Ada has no money and no help.  Things look grim for Ada until brash but practical Ruby Thewes (Rene Zellweger) arrives to assist her.  We learn of Ruby's character when she quickly converts a rooster into food, shocking Ada in the process.

Though Ada and Ruby manage to cope, things around town have deteriorated.  A gang of thugs take advantage of every opportunity to exert their exaggerated authority over the town and the valley.  As the movie progresses so too does the brutality of the thugs, who are supposedly the security for the town.  Eventually they brutalize and murder a family.  Yet, we see that there are others like them throughout the South.

Inman is injured during the battle of Petersburg.  He thinks of Ada and the few letters her received from her as he convalesces.  The words that stick in his mind are her pleas for him to return home.  Quicker than you can say ""deserter,"" Inman is trekking across the countryside to return to Ada.  Inman's journey becomes an epic as he battles brutal Northerners, more Southern thugs, and consoles a beautiful widow.

We know that at the end of the movie there must be a showdown between the major characters, and the ending is too good to give away so I leave it to viewers to discover the ending for themselves.

This movie has received much press and many accolades, receiving an Oscar for Rene Zellweger's incredible performance, which is critical to the success of this movie, and thirteen other awards and forty-nine nominations.  This movie is certainly a very good movie, but I think it shines more because too many modern movies have forsaken plot and acting for special effects, loud noises and blood.  This movie retreats to those characteristics that make movies art and allow movies to vie with books.  Modern audiences are so hungry for a genuine story and real acting that they have launched this movie into the category of a modern classic.  When you get tired of watching yet another video game become movie whose total plot consisting of racking up a body count, try popping this one into the DVD player and remember what it is like to have a story and serious acting.",1133395200,9,2925,4.686274509803922
2015583,5,B0001MDP36,"I readily concede the star power of this moving film.  Hard to go wrong with headliners like Nicole Kidman, Rene Zellweger, and Jude Law; even harder to miss the mark with COLD MOUNTAIN's supporting cast--a cast including Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Brendan Gleeson, Ray Winstone, and James Gammon, just to name a few.

But I'm going to digress from the thespians, for two reasons:  1) I'm ornery; and 2) the real sucess for this movie, in my humble little opinion, resides in the capable hands of its filmmakers.

Based on Charles Frazier's bestselling, award-winning novel, COLD MOUNTAIN is a bittersweet love story set in the majestic mountains of North Carolina during the tumultuous Civil War.  Two individuals make an instant soulful connection, just before their brief romance is violated by the ugliness of war.  While the man fights--first to survive, then to seek out his beloved--the woman must fend for herself, often under miserable, even brutal conditions.  Their odyssey forms the backbone of this unforgettable film.

Yet its compelling story is not the highlight of this movie; COLD MOUNTAIN is exceptional because of its remarkable craftmanship, beginning with director Anthony Minghella.  Aided by the haunting visuals of cinematographer John Seale, Minghella lets pictures tell the story.  He utilizes countless devices to augment the sweeping images portrayed:  disturbing slow motion shots, unique camera angles, dramatic audio voice-overs, a liquid image of a figure metaphysically projected in a water well.  Such visuals combine and mesh to present the entire spectrum of the story, from its elegance and beauty, to its brutality and sorrow.  Enhanced by the talent of its actors, Minghella's film is an artistic feast of wonder and delight.

Finally, COLD MOUNTAIN delivers the sights and sounds of 19th Century North Carolina via Gabriel Yared's dynamic musical score--by a profound sound track of unforgettable songs, including Jack White's ""Wayfaring Stranger"" and Alison Krauss' haunting ""You Will Be My Ain True Love.""  COLD MOUNTAIN is the entire package of epic movie making on a grand scale, a timeless treat for cinematic enthusiasts.

2015584,5,B0001MDP36,"I avoided this movie when it first came out, thinking that it would only be a pale ""Gone With the Wind"" remake. Big mistake.  What a fantastic film this turned out to be (I bought the DVD from Amazon). Each and every minute in this rip-roaring movie is chocked full of ideas, color and great acting.

The plot:  Won't go into it here, but suffice it to say that it blows ""Gone With the Wind"" out of the water.  And the battle scene that happens about ten minutes into the movie is incredible.  If you thought the battle scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" was remarkable, this one is even better--or worse, depending on how you look at things.

But what really stands out is the acting.  Renee Zellweger is incredible AND funny. What a versitle actress she is.  The rest of the cast is also great--Jude Law is wonderful and plays against any ""types"" he may have played in the past.  The accents are right on and everything rings true in this enormous saga about the Civil War.

2015585,4,B0001MDP36,"Anthony Minghella tackles a tough subject.  The Civil War can be a hard topic of interest.  If it's not done right, you'll lose your audience.  Luckily, he uses the right material for his project.

Based on the novel by Charles Frazier, Minghella's screenplay does well in describing the way life was during the mid-1800's.  Many loved ones wrote letters to their husbands, sons and friends in such passionate detail.  It's as true today as much as it was back then.

There are one or two deep holes in this film, but the plot changes very quickly and keeps our attention going by displaying some great performances.  Philip Semour Hoffmann gives a great performance as the wanted reverend.  Natalie Portman gives a short, but effective job as the long-suffering widow.  But it's Renee Zellweger who stands out with the best acting job in this movie.

2015588,5,B0001MDP36,"North Carolina author Charles Frazier's book gripped me and was a moving tale.  When I saw the film, the story came flooding back like a lost acquaintance.  I saw the film 3 times in the theatre, bought the DVD and have watched that multiple times.  I connect with this movie.  It is one of my favorite films.  The many aspects of the film come together for me to make it more than the sum of its parts: more than a tale of romance, or the Civil War, or an epic journey, or even a political film touching on abuse of power.

Anthony Minghella who won the Oscar as Best Director of ""The English Patient,"" served as executive director for another film starring Nicole Kidman (""The Interpreter""), and directed and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" that starred Jude Law, does a masterful job with combining these elements.  Gabriel Yared's Oscar-nominated  gorgeous musical score and John Seale's Oscar-nominated  breathtaking cinematography give the picture both sonic and visual elegance.  Best Songs Oscar nominees by T-Bone Burnett and Elvis Costello along with Jack White gave the film authentic mountain music.  The images of the snow and the swooping crows are some of the most memorable film visuals for me, like watching moving paintings.

Some have said that the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Jude Law didn't work.  I find that amazing since it played so well for me!  They don't have many scenes together, but the attraction and their separation in coming together were breathtaking.  While Jude Law was actually rooting for Sean Penn to win the Oscar for ""Mystic River,"" -- not to take anything away from Penn -- I rooted for his controlled, muted, and intensely brooding performance.  Jude Law as  Inman was one of the best performances I've seen and recalls the strength to internalize of another excellent actor, Paul Newman.  When Law finally connects in that cabin and says, ""I marry you; I marry you; I marry you,"" it is one of the most incredible screen moments.

Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Southern belle Ada Monroe who knows how to speak foreign languages and play piano but has no idea what to do with a chicken or how to plant vegetables is excellent.  She reaches many emotional levels from the grief she feels over the loss of her father to her attraction to Inman to the endless waiting and uncertainty to hardships of wartime and fending off the advances of Teague.  She well deserved her Oscar nomination.

Rene Zellweger as Ruby plays it broad and bubbly.  She is a bright light of the film giving it common sense, practicality, and humor.  In all of her work that I've seen from ""The Cinderella Man"" to ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" to ""Chicago,"" Ruby is her most distinctive character; and Zellweger well deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar.

I watched ""Closer,"" the Mike Nichols film that stars Natalie Portman and Jude Law, and then watched ""Cold Mountain"" which has Portman in a cameo as Sara whose baby Ethan is sick and whose husband has been killed.  It's interesting to see the two together in these two different films.

Law comes upon Sara, spends the night and at her invitation slips platonically into her bed.  When the Yankee soldiers come to rob her, Law saves her.  The DVD deleted scene shows Law strapping the soldiers' bodies to the horses, sending them away, the baby's death and Sara's suicide.  Having seen the film about 6 times before watching the deleted scenes, I think it made Inman's return to Ada all the more powerful as we think he had other choices that he did not pursue.  But it does make the DVD scene quite interesting.

Ray Winstone who was in the Clive Owen ""King Arthur"" does a good job as the revolting Teague who hunts down & kills deserters.  Ethan Suplee's performance as the heavyset mandolin player is priceless as we see his simple character not understand that he is about to be killed.  Jack White of White Stripes plays Georgia, the boy that eventually marries Ruby.  Donald Sutherland who is one of my favorite underrated actors has a nice cameo as the Reverend Monroe.  Kathy Baker from TV's ""Picket Fences"" has a strong supporting part as Sally Swanger.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Reverend Veasey has a nice supporting role as the constipated man of the cloth that is weak in ways of the flesh.  Giovanni Ribisi as Junior who lures the convicts to his house full of women and then turns them over to the soldiers has a nice cameo.  The woman who plays the lady with goats also does a nice job as does the creepy young blond bounty hunter.  ""Cold Mountain"" is one of those films that moves me each time I watch it.  The story, the performance, the look and feel of the film all make me say, ""Bravo!""",1130112000,5,4739,4.702669902912621

2015590,5,B0001MDP36,"Well, I liked this movie.

Many have written that it's about Confederates, and to hell with them and their war-suffering - they were cruel and evil, etc. I never understand this viewpoint.  Confederates and others have been wrong and still had deeply moving, interesting lives. In fact their fallability and loss at being decieved and dedicated to the wrong side of historic events, makes them more sympathetic to me.

If you want to root for the goodguys there are a thousand films out there. The suffering of a losing army in any war is vastly greater than that of the victors, and those broken soldiers have often have worthy stories. It is in heartbreak and defeat that one's deepest character is fully revealed.  After all, they didn't necessarily choose their side of the war. Their town was on in a certain area and the leaders of the region declared war. They had no options at all.

I thought the plot was thin on dialogue and was sometimes a bit flat, but Jude Law and Nicole are like walking poetry. Seeing the light in their eyes - words were unnecessary. The plot pulled them together in a sort of relentless call-to-romance which I thought was beautiful and haunting, where all outside events fell away around the hope of seeing their missing suitor. They were instant soulmates, a modern Romeo and Juliet.

Very few movies can convey deep emotion, either romantic love or real treagedy to the audience - it's an innaccessible emotional place which few directors can reach. Minghella has attempted it here and it worked on me.  Both thumbs way up.

One curious note:  In the book, Renee Zellweger's character was African American. Renee did a wonderful job, but wouldn't that have worked better here?

If you liked this, see 'Ride with the Devil' Ang Lee's excellent film on the Civil War starring Tobey Mcguire.",1128902400,3,1826,4.768253968253968

The direction is there, and the performances are great (Zellwegger is wonderful), but the story misses the mark.

I loved THE ENGLISH PATIENT, but this film neglects the lovers and piles on everything else (and I mean EVERYTHING).

The lovers are barely introduced when Jude Law is whisked off to the most hellish places of the Civil War.  Law and Nicole Kidman are only left to think of each other as fantasy lovers or ideals, so no emotional connection takes place between them.  At least one that that the audience can invest in.

And the sheer horrors of what Law goes through over and over pretty much numb us by the time they do get together.

I really wanted to like this movie--and it is better than TITANIC (great movie, lame romance) and the laughably-bad PEARL HARBOR (lame movie, ridiculous romance)--but there was no emotional pay off to COLD MOUNTAIN.  Not like THE ENGLISH PATIENT.

2015592,4,B0001MDP36,"`Cold Mountain', a film based on Charles Frazier's outstanding novel of the same name, tells a powerful tale set in the end game of the Civil War, as the Rebel armies fought on though all hope for a Southern victory was gone. A wounded rebel soldier, Inman (Jude Law), deserts the hopeless fighting to make a desperate, dangerous quest to his mountain home in North Carolina and to Ada (Nicole Kidman), the girl that he left behind. The story cuts back and forth between Inman's perilous trek walking home and Ada's struggle to maintain her farm in a world fallen apart around her. Interspersed in these two strands are flashbacks to Inman and Ada's pre-war courting. It's a sad story of the cost of war, not on the battlefields, but on the lives and fortunes of those left behind on the home front.

`Cold Mountain' is beautifully and movingly filmed. It opens with a dramatic portrayal of the Battle of the Crater that is stunningly effective in showing the brutal violence and horror of the hopeless war Inman leaves to seek his far away home. Just as effectively captured is the natural beauty of the mountain home he left behind, as well as the changing and challenging landscapes through which he moves on his journey home.

Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are adequate leads, though neither really distinguishes themselves in their roles, and their near perfect physical attractiveness seems inauthentic for a film set in 1860s Appalachia. The best performances in the movie belong to the excellent supporting cast - in particular Renee Zellweger's brilliant portrayal of Ruby Thewes, the tough, coarse, outspoken young woman who taught the frail Ada how to survive. Philip Seymour Hoffman also deserves mention for his brief but evocative performance as a decadent rogue preacher Inman meets on his journey home, as does Natalie Portman for her role as a desperate, war widow mother whom Inman encounters. Donald Sutherland, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Brendan Gleeson, and Ray Winstone round out a fine cast of character actors.

`Cold Mountain' is not a perfect film, but when all of its virtues are considered together - its stunning visual storytelling, outstanding supporting cast, and its use of amazing old-time Appalachian music throughout, it emerges as one of the best Civil War movies yet made. It is an honest, tragic tale of war's cost, told well. It has my recommendation.

2015594,3,B0001MDP36,"The biggest problem with this movie is that it simply cannot compare to Charles Frazier's novel. However, there's only so much you can expect when a film is adapted from a book, and overall, the movie ""Cold Mountain"" isn't all that bad...but I still think it could have been better.

In the film, Jude Law plays Inman, a Confederate soldier who deserts the battlefront after surviving a serious injury. He encounters many hurdles in his attempt to return to Cold Mountain and to Ada (Nicole Kidman), a woman he fell in love with following a very brief encounter prior to his departure. The film flashes back and forth to Inman's adventures and Ada's struggle to survive on her farm following the death of her father. She is fortunate to have the assistance of the free-spirited Ruby (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), with whom she forms a powerful friendship that feeds her spirit and gives her the strength to keep on believing that Inman will return to her someday.

I'm usually a big fan of Kidman's work, but her performance in ""Cold Mountain"" was a bit disappointing. I'm not sure if that's a reflection on her as an actress or on Ada's character, which is kind on one-dimensional. Law's performance is acceptable but not extraordinary, and the real star of the film is Zellweger, whose portrayal of Ruby is vibrant and also downright hilarious at times. Natalie Portman also has a small but strong part as a woman that Law's character encounters along his journey home, and Brendan Gleeson does a great job in the role of Ruby's deadbeat father, Stobrod.

The first forty minutes of the film are incredibly dry...I almost had to turn it off. However, things picked up after a while and the film got much better as it went along. The movie just doesn't have the same emotional appeal as the novel, which is why I can't give it a high recommendation.",1127088000,5,1846,4.726708074534161

2015596,4,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain is a movie set during the Civil War era. It covers the life of a confederate soldier from his time in his home at Cold Mountain, to his service to the South, to his eventual return to his home following a battle wound.

Jude Law plays the lead character, Inman, and he is joined by co- star Nicole Kidman as Ada Monroe. The previews for this film tried to portray it as an incredible love story between Inman and Ada. It really isn't like that. The film is mostly about the Civil War and Inman's journey back home to North Carolina. He and Ada write back and forth and they spend a good deal of time thinking about each other. But this film is more of a wartime drama than a romantic picture.

Cold Mountain moves slowly at times and the movie is very long- more than 2.5 hours in total length. I found it to be mostly enjoyable, and some of the scenes with Inman overcoming obstacles as he journeys back home are intense and memorable. On the other hand, there are many scenes that should have been axed by the editors. Some of the scenes, during the film's slower moments, could have been eliminated without having any adverse effect on the film. This would have made the movie more concise and helped it move at a faster clip.

This movie was nominated for a few Academy Awards and it did win one: The Best Supporting Actress award, which went to Renee Zellweger who plays Ruby, a woman who has lived her life as a drifter and is now living at Cold Mountain, helping Ada tend to the family farm. Zellweger is quite good as the hard- edged, gritty young woman and she deserved the award she received. Cold Mountain also received a nomination for Best Cinematography- an award it certainly deserved to win with all of the great scenery. But it came up short in this category.

War films are often overrun with violence and Cold Mountain does have its share. There are some nasty scenes of blood and gore and you will find yourself looking away from the screen more than once. But this is, after all, a war film so some violence is expected.

Cold Mountain is a very good movie overall. I cannot comment on how it compares to the novel it is based on since I have never read it.

I love war movies, but my idea of a good war movie is 'Troy' or 'Gladiator' you know, the real swords and sandles type stuff, but my wife was dieing to see this so we rented it and I was really taken back at how great it really was.  Clocking in at about two and a half hours you never really feel like your wasting time.  This film keeps you glued to the screen fromt he opening battle sequence to the closing supper.

2015615,4,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain is the story of love, hardships, and about one man travelling hundreds of miles to return to the one woman who he loves dearly...

Jude Law stars as Inman, a man who was a confederate soldier during the Civil War. After witnessing too much death and despair, he realizes that he does not believe in the war and what the South is fighting for. After recieving three letters from the woman he left behind, named Ada, he decides to desert the war and sets off on an adventerous quest to come to the aid of Ada, who is facing lots of hardships.

Jude Law's character was well done. He portrayed a man who is good natured in his heart and does the right thing after seeing so many cruel people in the world...

Nicole Kidman stars as Ada, a young woman who leaves the busy Northern cities to come down to the quiet town of Cold Mountain. Despite knowing how to cook and mend clothes, she faces extreme hardships after her father dies of old age and she is left in this huge farm all by herself. While I did like how she portrayed Ada, I thought she was rather old to be exactly like her. [But besides that I thought Kidman did a fantastic job.]

Renee Zellweger costars as Ruby. A sort of Tom boyish girl, who shows up on Ada's doorstep asking for a job in exchange for food and a place to sleep. I also thought Zellweger was good, as she plays a woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind and does what she wants. Both Ada and Ruby made a great team.

As I said in the title, the book is just a little bit better, going into more detail about the adventures of Inman. From meeting a preacher who was going to kill a slave girl because she was carrying his child, to a young woman whose alone in a cabin with a pig as her only food source. [In the book she didn't kill the pig because she was afraid she couldn't do it.]

Although some of the movie is twisted into a new Hollywood style [Another example would have to be the start of the movie compared to the book, as the book starts with Inman in the hospital and his conversation with the blind man much longer.] I found the movie entertaining and the romance between Inman and Ada believable.

Once last thing was that in the book, Cold Mountain was about the Mountain that Inman always looked for because he knew Ada was on the other side, waiting. I thought the movie did not dwell into how important the mountain was for Inman in the movie as much as it could.

Other characters add to the drama and emotion [The Home Guard and Ruby's father are perfect examples.] and many great action moments [Although the battle at the beginning might not be suitable for all children if you are watching with the kids.

I laughed when the actors kept losing their accent, then resuming it again in another scene, especially the goat lady.

Nicole Kidman does make a convincing fish out of water character, and only those folks who've read the book can appreciate her performance.

Besides too many foriegn and nonSouthern actors, I found it troubling that US extras lost out to Romanian soldiers.  Sure it costs more to shoot in the US, but North Carolina should look like North Carolina.

I watched the ""making of"" included in the dvd, and found it was too talky, and too much of the director.

The music soundtrack is a keeper, especially if you're into old timey music such as banjo frailing, and more.  Anyone who's spent time in the Deep South and learned much of the area's music would have run across sacred harp music.  It's powerful, and might take a while to appreciate for most people.

1) Nicole Kidman is almost forty,but she plays a woman in her early to mid twenties(unconvincingly)

  4-wears trousers

4) Kidman's character is supposedly well educated but apparently is too stupid to know that she must work to eat.

5) Kidman's character falls in ""love"" with a  man she has spent maybe 15 minutes with. Apparantly this is enough to sustain her for about four years.

6)  A preacher is portrayed as a drunkard, a near murderer,
  and a fornicator.

7) This is actually quite a political movie. It makes a very strong anti-war statement. Deserters are heroes, ""home guard"" people are evil. The only good people are the ones who hate war.

2015619,4,B0001MDP36,"This movie exists purely in parts.  It doesn't quite work for me as a whole (it felt REALLY long, gratuitous sex, a slow opening, and a storyline that I cared less and less about as the movie went on), but I enjoyed it.  It is good but not great.  But this movie is absolutely heartbreaking in some scenes, which moved me completely to tears.

Basically, the movie is about a confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law) who is tired of fighting in a war he doesn't believe in.  He decides to return home to his love, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), but Inman is hunted by the North (""yankees"") and the South (who are killing deserters of war) alike.  Of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law, it can be said that they are well-cast in their roles as Ada and Inman.  They do have some chemistry and there are some beautiful scenes between them, and their performances are good, but not great.  This is not intended as a criticism because I enjoyed their work (I thought they captured anguish and love.

I haven't read the book so I'm not entirely sure what I am saying is fair, but here are my criticisms: one, a really slow opening.  It seemed to take an hour for Inman to finally start returning home to Ida.  I thought the opening war scene was not very well done; too much shock value and too little emphasis on human emotions, brutality of war, etc.  Two, gratuitous sex.  There is just one bizarre sequence in the movie (is it in the book?  I don't know...) where Inman and some corrupt priest end up in a brothel house.  It's very disturbing and gratuitous.  I find it rather unnecessary.  (The love scenes between Inman and Ada are rather graphic but I can understand it since they are deeply in love and ""Cold Mountain"" is an intense love story.)  This is definitely not a movie to take little kids to.

Now that I've gotten all my criticism out of the way, let me say that I also have a lot of praise for this movie.  I said the movie exists entirely in parts and there are several, particularly the ones where the Southern men are hunting down Confederate soldiers who have deserted the war.  There is one scene about a husband and wife hiding their two young boys in their home.  There is another about two men playing instruments to the Southern men, while knowing they will be shot shortly after.  These scenes are very beautiful.

I think high praise goes to Renee Zellweger for her funny, touching, and strong portrayal of Ruby, the woman that comes to help Ada on the farm.  Zellweger is uproariously funny and coarse; she steals every single scene she's in.  And she is also responsible for one of the more moving moments in the film, when she finds her badly wounded father in the snow, bleeding from a gunshot wound.  But the gem of this movie is, without a doubt, Natalie Portman as a widowed mother with a young child.  Portman's two short scenes are my favorite in the movie.  I don't want to spoil this one for you but Portman's touching and memorable performance (in only 10 minutes of film) will bring you to tears.  It's a very powerful moment...Although ""Cold Mountain"" has a lot of these moments, they don't quite work together as a whole.

Renee Zellweger was a little over the top, but she did deserve recognition for making the film partially enjoyable when she stole some scenes. However, Nicole Kidman was such a miscast. I thought if any actor can go from a great comedy/musical/tragedy role like Satine in ""Moulin Rouge!"" then go to a great interpretation of a literary figure like the one she did Virginia Woolf in ""The Hours"", then this should have been a breeze. Unfortunately, she was not credible in this role at all! I read the book beforehand (it's beautiful and merits its huge popularity among readers) but the movie did slip on the importance of Ada being a kind of an ""odd girl out"" trying to fit into two types of society in the Civil War South and ultimately failing until she meets Ruby. A previous reviewer said Natalie Portman should have been in the lead role. I think she really could have pulled it off just from watching her short presence in the film. Nicole would not have been a problem if she weren't in half the movie looking like a perfect Southern Belle the whole time. Moreover, was there supposed to be a love story? It was not there.

Well, he should have done a similar thing for Cold Mountain which is an excellent book. Nicole Kidman is not convincing as the daughter of a North Carolina chaplain. She always has every hair in place and her forehead is botoxed up the kazoo. She looks older than Inman and even seems to overpower him at times. Natalie Portman, who plays a small role in the movie, would have been better as the lead. Don't even get me started on Renee Zellweger's granny imitation. How she won an Academy Award for that cariacature performance is beyond me. And then there is the scenery -- that was definitely NOT North Carolina! And then there is the grisly rewriting of the book which makes the Southern guys in the Home Guard look like the real bad guys. This movie was a mess and the audience I saw it with went home very deflated.",1113782400,18,1128,4.401913875598086
2015622,4,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain is a great film and features a lot of great actors.  Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellweger, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Giovanni Ribisi, and Natalie Portman all contribute strong performances in an actor-driven film.  The scenery and direction is top notch and Zellweger's portrayal of Ruby is reason enough on its own to buy the movie.

Cold Mountain gets slow at points, as it elongates minor subplots and quickly presents the Law/Kidman romance, but still the film works.  Many complained about Kidman in this film but I thought her performance was good.  It is Law and Zellweger who really stand out though.  Hoffman is great as always and Portman proves she's one of Hollywood's top young actresses, doing more with her five minutes of screen time than most actresses do in an entire film.

See Cold Mountain to see a film that is well crafted and returns to the tradition of good cinema, where a film has a great story, great characters, great actors, and something to say about life.",1112745600,5,1023,4.878612716763006

The actors are too winning to be real- we need ugly ones or at least no-so-good loking ones to be character actors. People like Robert Duvall; not so good looking, but he can act.

Mingella loves glamor, loves scope- but this was the wrong subject, wrong time, and definitly the wrong place in history. Stick to the 1950's Jazz scene, Tony.",1112486400,3,480,4.505747126436781
2015624,3,B0001MDP36,"I ultimately enjoyed watching this film on DVD, though I have to say that I enjoyed and was frustrated by different aspects of this film in equal measures.  On the plus side, I liked the performances, the scenery, the music, and the offbeat nature of the love story (specifically, seeing two people get so taken with each other after only a few brief meetings where only a handful of words were exchanged).  I also liked the playful sense of humor peppered throughout the movie.  On the negative side, in too many cases that sense of humor appears immediately before or after moments of horrific violence, which is jarring and disruptive.  Also, I didn't like the fact that the deputies (for want of a better word) looking for Inman because he deserted his regiment are made to be really over-the-top villainous.  This turns Inman into a kind of tragic victim when they finally catch up with him.  I think the story would have been much more memorable if the deputies were simply regular, honorable people with an unpleasant task: rounding up and punishing deserters.  That would have resulted in Inman being responsible for the consequences of his actions (deserting his regiment to find the love of his life), which is much more interesting and tragic than having cartoon villains finally catch up with him, the ""good"" guy.  To end on a positive note, ""Cold Mountain"" is over two-and-a half hours long, and it held my interest throughout.  Nice image quality and a second disc of extras round out a generous and nicely-produced package.",1111536000,4,1538,4.8396946564885495

I watched the DVD with some trepidation, figuring that it would involve much of the same.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Jude Law as Inman, Nicole Kidman as Ada, and Renee' Zellwager as Ruby are magnificent.

The movie is breathtaking visually.  The screenplay follows history, most notably our Civil War's Battle of the Crater and its aftermath.

This is one of my top 5 anti-war movies.  It is up there with films like Castle Keep and A Midnight Clear.

I have an interest in Civil War history.  I appreciate that we are starting to see works in print and in film that move us away from our romantic notions of that terrible war.

This is a movie for history lovers and film buffs alike.",1111190400,2,788,4.564285714285714
2015626,2,B0001MDP36,"I am still unsure of why this film has received so much hype.  Jude Law is pretty, Kidman is prissy, and Renee, well, she's there.  But none of them deliver in the acting department... and the cameos are nothing but self-indulgent.  Phillip Seymore-Hoffman is uncharacteristically uninspiring, and Jena Malone is downright awful.

The plot was written, I am convinced, by someone unfamiliar with Gone with the Wind, yet trying to create a modern reconstruction of the film.  It drags.  It meanders.  It loses focus more times than I can count.  And finally, when the beautiful lovers are finally united, after two hours of waiting, extraordinarily uninspiring sex breaks out, assassinating the sincerity and beauty of the characters otherwise undefiled relationship.  Wait.... what relationship?!  How long did Law's character know Kidman's?  There is absolutely no set up, no sympathy for their romance.  These are two people who aren't seen together on the screen for more than fifteen minutes!  How are we expected to believe they are so desperately in love with each other if there is no time devoted to establishing their relationship?

On the brighter side, the film is magnificently shot, with beautiful scenery and an extremely crisp cinematic style, and the scale is epic, but this simply does not pull the film from out of the rather deep hole it digs itself.

I can't recommend this film for anyone serious about good filmmaking or serious drematic stories.  The best I can do is say it's a nice looking chick-flick with a hundred different stars if you can't find anything better to watch.",1110326400,8,1601,5.030418250950571

2015628,3,B0001MDP36,"I had problems with two aspects of the film:

1.  The acting by Nicole Kidman was a cardboard cutout of the stereotypical Southern belle and seemed too concerned with her accent and mannerisms to give much attention to personality.

2.  The lack of homework on the albino character of Bosie.  This was played, however, very chillingly by British actor Charlie Hunnam, whom I failed to even recognize until I saw his name in the credits.  He plays the title role in ""Nicholas Nickleby"" and is unrecognizable in ""Cold Mountain"".  The fact that those who suffer from albinism have poor eyesight, which would have rendered the gunslinging exploits of bouncing Bosie improbable, seems to reflect a lack of homework on the part of the filmmakers.

Jude Law, as always, is excellent as his character traverses the way home a la The Odyssey back to his true love.  The Civil War scenes are very heartrending.  The characters he meets along the way, including the lavicious reverend, the lonely young widow, and the hooligan hillbillies are wonderful and add much-needed respite from the weightiness of the Civil War subject matter.

Renee Zellwiger, one of my favorite actresses, is a bit over the top, but a wonderful character that took the pain out of watching the scenes with the boring Kidman character.

I recommend this movie, but not as a true-to-canon depiction and not as a definitive authority on 1860s history.  For entertainment purposes, though, it is certainly worth seeing.",1110153600,4,1481,4.971544715447155

I could feel her pain and the pain of her love who so desperately tries to return to her. Not uncommon, for the bond of true love is strong. Gripping scenes throughout kept my interest. Excellent example of friendship from those whom we least expect it. Renee Zellweger is a favorite and was a delight to watch her in this extraordinary role.

This film stands on its own, of course, and is a nice tale of love, war, romance and adventure. It is full of big stars and tends to get better the longer it goes on. I thought the movie meandered quite a bit the first 80 minutes or so, then improved markedly with the appearance of Renee Zellweger's character, whose portrayal dominated every scene.

As to the love story, well, I've seen better. As to this movie deserving the Oscar for best film, I can't go along with that either. This is a good movie by any standard. But I saw ""Fargo"" uncut the next night and immediately saw the difference between this good movie and a completely original and very great film.

So enjoy ""Cold Mountain"" for its compelling scenes, lengthy but involving story, and Zellweger's Oscar-winning portrayal and hope that Minghellas does not next bring the Hundred Years War to the screen.",1109030400,3,1187,4.752427184466019

2015633,4,B0001MDP36,"This movie in my opinon was the best movie of it's year and it's a tragic shame it didn't beat Lord of The Rings for the title with a great cast, beautiful script, and wonderful music this movie did not go wrong in any sense. Once again it's one of those Civil War movies that takes place in the South but, delievers a ""anti-war"" vibe from the dialouge and action squences-- perhaps because you see more losses than trimuphs.

In the movie Nicole Kidman moves to Cold Mountain with her father who is a preacher... she quickly becomes the infatuation of a local boy Inman. Nicole and Inman quickly become attracted to eachother and with a couple of encounters they grow to love one another. When the war starts Inman quickly enlists to fight for the South leaving Nicole behind. When Nicole's father suddenly dies she finds herself alone fighting to survive with no life skills it's a real struggle for her-- she writes Inman and tells him ""come back to me."" After recovering from a serious wound Inman makes the decision to try to go back to Cold Mountain encountering, whore houses, yankees, less than honorable chirstians, and a goat lady. But, deserters are being shot for desertion. Reese Witherspoon comes into the mix as the loud mouthed and strong willed Ruby who helps teach Nicole life skills. I won't give away the ending. But all in all this movie is about love, loss, faith, and the struggle when we're lost to come home to the ones we love.

I'm not usually a Nicole Kidman fan and I didn't really like her Southern accent but, she did great as the spoiled preacher's daughter who finds herself alone after her father's death. Reese Witherspoon in my opinon did a lack lester performance as Ruby who helps Nicole learn how to survive on her own. Jude Law does a great job but, not good enough to win the Academy Award for best supporting actor. Great visual effects, stunning scenery, and well-written script make this movie sparkle.

Only two things wrong with this movie are it's length and it's also one of those movies you can only enjoy once. All in all I highly recomend you rent this movie and pass around the tissues for this one is a tear-jerker!",1108684800,,2168,4.582474226804123

Gruesome and violent, it definately makes you hate some of the characters but does very little to endear you to the main characters of the story.

Unfortunately in the movie the love story was just about non-existant.  A glimpse, a stolen moment and a glass of water does not equal the epic love story of all ages.

The scenery of the movie was excellent and really is what saved this movie from being 1 or 2 stars.  If they could have given an oscar for best actor to the background, this should have been nominated.

This is the kind of movie you go see if you liked the horse whisperer or brave heart and you thought to yourself ""I'd love to go see where they shot that film!""",1107993600,4,781,4.272108843537415
2015635,5,B0001MDP36,"It would be easy to dismiss COLD MOUNTAIN as nothing more than an upper scale ""chick flick,"" a love story chonicling what two disparate lovers go through to reunite during the time of the bloody Civil War.  But Anthony Minghella's movie is so beautifully filmed, scored and acted, that it's love story forms the backdrop for what the Civil War did to this country:  it tore it apart; it ravaged the people and the land; it put neighbor against neighbor, and truly established this war as a dark spot in our history.  If the movie's main flaw is the fact that the two lovers barely knew each other and shouldn't have been so obsessed with their reunion, it is eclipsed by the supporting scenarios, that involve Ada's maturity as a result of her relationship with the rascally Ruby; Ruby's reluctant reconciliation with her deserter father; the cruelty of the ragtag band of law enforcers who take it upon themselves to act as executioners for deserters; the pain of a young widow who asks Inman to lay beside her on her bed so she doesn't feel lonely.  These set pieces more than compensate for the weakness of the main character's love.  However, once the lovers are reunited, the performances are so touching we can believe they have at last fallen in love.

The performances are uniformly excellent:  Jude Law (an actor I feel is overrated) gives one of his best performances as the laconic, driven Inman; Nicole Kidman is superb as Ada, showing a quiet self-consciousness and eventually a fierce strength and reserve; Renee Zellweger delivers her Oscar winning performance with a casual brilliance---this is one of her finest moments, too; Donald Sutherland, one of our most overlooked actors, is very convincing in his brief role as Ada's minister father; Brendan Gleeson (another William H. Macy) delivers his usual solid performance as Ruby's errant father; Jack White in his small role as Georgia is impressive; Kathy Baker (Picket Fences; Edward Scissorhands) delivers a quietly powerful performance as Sally, who watches her husband and sons brutally murdered by the self-imposed judge and executioners; Lucas Black (who I just watched last night in the excellent FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) is remarkable in his brief role as Oakley, a teenage soldier mortally wounded in Petersburg; Ray Winstone viably diabolic as the brutal Teak; Eileen Atkins as Mandy, the haglike lady who takes a wounded Inman in; and Natalie Portman in her role as Sarah, the widow who touches Inman's life so poignantly.

With a remarkable musical score by Gabriel Yared (City of Angels) and the lovely tunes by Allison Krauss and Sting, COLD MOUNTAIN is a richly realized movie, a testament to love and endurance, and a warning about the hopelessness of war.",1107648000,5,2737,4.960698689956332

Everyone did a lovely job - although the chemistry between Kidman and Law was ... watery. Renee Zellweger was astonishing as Ruby. And my favorite surprise was recognizing Kathy Baker as a woman who loses everything. The same Kathy Baker who plays the seductress neighbor in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. She was painfully beautiful in her role in COLD MOUNTAIN. Oh - and until I read the credits, I didn't even realize Natalie Portman was in the mix.

2015637,3,B0001MDP36,"The violence in this movie (including sexual violence) overshadows many valuable elements of the film.  The themes could have been conveyed and the characters could have been developed without showing every graphic detail of gore.

We are, of course, supposed to learn that life during the Civil War, especially in the South, was horrific.  Depravity was rampant.  People turned against their friends and neighbors.  When the patriotic, well meaning, men were out fighting in the war, their families faced great peril at the hands of the enemy from the North and the enemies from next door.  Furthermore, the evils of American slavery had weakened Southern society accross the generations. This made it that much easier to translate anger and fear into violence and murder.  People did whatever they thought would help them to survive, and their methods were often cruel and animalistic.

So, I got it.  The messages of the movie are clear.  The story is  riveting.  The characters are deep and fascinating.  The acting is superb.  So, why lean on the crutch of graphically portrayed carnage?  In 1939, ""Gone With the Wind"" (GWTW)was able to convey the horror of the time without displaying minute by minute violence.  There is a reason that, 65 years later, GWTW is still one of the best movies in existence.  I doubt that ""Cold Mountain"" will come close to standing the test of time.

This is a disturbing movie that should be avoided by children and sensitive viewers.",1105401600,9,1471,4.959016393442623

I think Cold Mountain is something that will always mean a lot to me. I cant forget those absolutely brilliant shot nerve ticklers of emotional chasers of scenes. The scene when there's a song that plays. The song thats a travellors song ""I'm going home to see my mother"" and then I thought this movie has the best ever music for it. I think the Soundtrack to Cold Mountain is totally magnificent but thats another story. I think Jude Law acted well. I don't like Renee Zewellger but she was funny and the accent really suited her.

Overall,its more of a story than a film. I just was really moved by the detail that went into the whole project. I suggest this movie to only those people who don't expect to see inside out of a film within a few scenes but like understanding the concept and its works.

It is a war movie that not only shows the Civil War in a real light, a harrowing bloodbath, but also manages to weave a heartwrenching love story into it.  Inman, played by Jude Law, gives up fighting in the war and makes the long journey home to his sweetheart (Nicole Kidman).  Over the years the two lovers are apart, life becomes difficult and dangerous, and they fear they will never reunite.

This movie features excellent acting on the parts of the main characters (Law, Kidman, and Zellweger) and also by the not-so-main characters.  It is very easy to become engrossed in this movie and to really feel sympathy for the characters' struggles.

The scenes of war and the senseless killing and hatred will stick in your mind, as will the Inman's grueling journey home to his love, and their subsequent reunion.

2015640,3,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" is somewhat based on the book by Charles Frazier and as one reviewer said, is filmed by Anthony Minghella in an attempt to recreate his success with the romantic ""The English Patient"". The ""English Patient"" was I believed, an unfilmable novel until I saw the film. It worked. The tragedy in the ""English Patient"" was the love story while here, it is the senseless war. This film works because the story is hard to screw up. The war scenes and scenes of Inman's travels back to Cold Mountain are disturbing and haunting. I was really struck by the harshness of that time and the effect of war on women- how difficult it would have been to survive when farms were wiped out by the draft. The failure of this film is that this movie lacks passion in its central relationship. You have to suspend your disbelief and believe there is a relationship- the film does not lend support to the premise that Inman gives up everything for Ida after receiving a letter from her begging him to come home (though that is Hollywood's stamp and not the prime reason for desertion in the book). The 2 love scenes between the leads are particularly dull. Jude Law does a wonderful job as do the supporting cast but the presence of Nicole Kidman strained the film's credibility. What stood out like a red flag for me and ruined the film was the casting of Nicole Kidman. I must admit to not being a fan, but I never disliked her until I saw her in this film which I believe she ruins. With her bleached yellow straw hair contrasting with dark eyebrows, Botox-paralyzed forehead devoid of emotion and Barbie-doll features she fits so poorly into this period-appropriate cast, and God is she a lousy actress here. Renee Zelwegger's line that ""if I cry one tear for him [father] I stole it from a crocodile"" is far more applicable to Kidman, whose acting in this film is so contrived. One never forgets she is acting, and an actress. Her technique consists of exaggerated responses- so that rather than becoming the character, she becomes a caricature. Her botox-paralyzed forehead is bizarre and made her displays of emotion especially unbelievable and her performance stands in stark contrast to the subdued Law and ebullient Zelwegger. Were it not for the supporting cast I would not have sat through this film to its end. It is unneccesarily long and repetitive at times.

I suppose this is a particular warning to actresses everywhere- let the botox wear off before you appear in a film! When one is called upon to display emotion, the botox will betray your visit to the plastic surgeon every time. Oh, the wrinkles go- but the artificial frozen look that replaces them is even more bizarre and undisguisable!",1104624000,7,2707,4.698947368421052

And the knowledge that these are Americans killing one another gives chilling irony to the words ""civil war"". My stomach still hurts.

What is good about the movie? Cinematically it is excellent and the acting - especially the minor parts - is excellent. Remove Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Nathalie Portman etc. out of the movie and you might actually have a better film. The reason for this is that the only reason to keep some scenes in the movie is because of the performances therein.
Take out the short set-up to the movie and the short reunion at the end, and all you have in between is scene after scene of how nasty the 'deserter hunters' are and how sordid and deperate people became at the end of the war. You could take an hour out of this film and still not lose the story - what little of it there is.
Let me ruin the movie for you. In the end the bad guys get what's comin' and the two lovers get back together. That's about as deep as an episode of 'Dukes of Hazard' with the same accents.",1104364800,15,1086,4.225961538461538
2015643,4,B0001MDP36,"The characters in this movie spend a great deal of time searching for food. And proclaiming that they are hungry. Which in some respects was indicative of the desperate times they lived in. It also involves some off-shoots of the digestive process, namely the defrocked preacher suffering acute constipation and a member of the traveling troubadours led by  Rene Zellweger's dad eating some less than digestible wild game and later summoning Ralph... There are alot of hungry people in this movie.

There are two concurrent levels of the story. One involves Jude Law trying to find his way back from the horrors of the Civil War to Nicole Kidman. The other is Nicole Kidman wondering if Law will make it back to her. In his travels, Law talks to those he encounters about his quest to return to Kidman.

One person Law talks to about this is an elderly woman living in a gypsy-style setting who temporarily takes him in. She is somewhat unique as she proclaims that everything she needs can be derived from a goat...interesting concept. In one scene, he talks at length about finding his way back home. She sits and listens and looks as if she might nod off. Eventually, she gives him something to sleep... or to end his discussion about going home before she nods off.

Throughout the movie, Kidman is harassed by the Home Guard, a motley collection of ""stay-at homers"" who travel the countryside looking for Confederate deserters and generally making a nuisance of themselves. A younger member of the Home Guard bears a striking resemblance to a young Edgar Winter. As an alternate ending, instead of the Winter look-a-like plugging our hero and dashing Kidman's hopes for a permanent reunion, he could have put down his guns and hooked up with Zellweger's dad's musical group and an earlier version of the classic instrumental ""Frankenstein"" might of been born a la southern style.

A couple of semi-noticeable gaffes in this film...In one, Law takes an early-appearing, copper plate likeness of Kidman to carry off to war with him and places it in an envelope with a self-stick adhesive flap similiar to what you get your dough back from at a bank drive-through window.

In another, Kidman's father, Donald Sutherland passes away and she opts to wear his large, oversize black coat in rememberance. As the movie progresses to the final scenes, the oversize, ill-fitting coat she is wearing is gradually and magically transformed into  a trim-sized, finely tailored, cut close at the waist wrap that looks right off the rack at Bloomingdale's.

In the final scene, everyone who has survived the war, hunger, tainted meat and the Home Guard or bothered to stick around until the end of the movie are outside sitting around a table...eating. Like I said, there are alot of hungry people in this movie...",1103760000,28,2804,4.876050420168068

So Jude Law chooses Nicole Kidman over heroism and you can't blame him one bit unless you're the type that thinks everybody ought to live by the sword and die by the sword.  No, my only real problem with Cold Mountain is the nearly obligatory sex scene.  Sure, most would say its natural and beautiful etc.  But if watching other people make love in real life is considered a perversion, why is it ""beautiful"" to watch simulated sex on the big screen? It just takes an otherwise intelligent and thoughtful drama into the temporary realm of porn.

  When Ada's father dies she is left along with no real skills to speak of, she doesn't even cook.  Thankfully, Ruby comes along and helps her get back on her feet and Ada starts to become the woman she really is.

  While Ada and Ruby are forming a deep friendship, Innman is walking home to her, and running into all sorts of trouble.  I won't tell you how this movie ends but I'll say this.  You can't help but hold your breath, laugh, and cry.  Sometimes all at once.

I was VERY disappointed. During the entire film I couldn't help thinking, is it a fake or what? It can't be Mingella's movie! To me, all it does is tries to pretend it's the same kind of movie as The English Patient, with similar storytelling and moments that I can clearly see as 'emotional climax triggers'.

But whereas I almost cried each time I saw the latest Swimmers' Cave episode for the first 15 times watching the English Patient, I had not a single moment of emotional agitation during Cold Mountain.

2015648,4,B0001MDP36,"For me, Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain proved to be the best big studio release of the year (as well as one of the most criticized). This Civil War epic does an excellent job of portraying war as something that effects everyone involved in a purely negative way.

Almost Homeric in it's presentation, Cold Mountain tells the story of a man and a woman torn apart by war. The majority of the film is dedicated to the struggles (brought on by war times) of the leading man as he tries to make his way back to his ""ain true love.""

For a Civil War movie, many will be surprised at how it glazes over huge issues such as race or even showing real battles, but this was never the point of the movie. Any war is brutal. From the Civil War to the War in Iraq, wartime's affect all who are involved in a very brutal way. Cold Mountain knows this and creates an atmosphere of true sadness at what war really means for everyone (not just the men fighting).

Few times a year does a movie of such size contain a cast that is on fire through and through. Every single actor in this film (from the Oscar winning performance from Renee Zellweger, the breakout lead male performance of Jude Law, to Philip Seymour Hoffman, to a movie stealing scene with Natalie Portman) simply shines the whole time they are on screen. In fact, Cold Mountain clearly delights in it's small scenes and minor characters so much that the movie never sags under its own weight. Tragically and beautifully constructed, Cold Mountain is an excellent display of crafty film making.",1101945600,,1546,4.514285714285714

I already knew I wasn't gonna like it, but I tried to give it an honest chance, and it BLOWS! just like I originally thought it would. I expected that with Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellwegger in it this film couldn't lose. I was seriously mistaken. Despite the fact that all those big name A-list stars were in it, I just couldn't connect with it enough to really get into it. I guess the whole ""love story"" aspect of the movie was enough to move some people, but I am not easily impressed. Frankly, I wasn't impressed with anything about this movie because it was just sooo slow and drawn out. Let's be honest. If you're into action or suspense this isn't the movie for you. However, if you're suffering from insomnia, and you need something to help you sleep, then pop this movie right into the VCR or DVD player.

2015660,3,B0001MDP36,"as much as I liked certain parts of Cold Mountain, I disliked other elements as much.

the pros: Jude Law. Great performance, and I'd watch him sorting laundry for almost three hours any ole day of the week. Renee Z., who I find to be one of our more overrated actresses of the day, was excellent. Although I disagree with her winning the Oscar (hello Academy, Shohreh Aghdashloo from House of Sand & Fog) she was perfect in her role as Ruby, although I understand in the book she was a mulatto character, which pisses me off since a bevy of black or mulatto actresses could have played it as good or better (Thandie Newton, Vivica Fox). But again, it's the first performance of hers truly worthy of accolades. The supporting cast was also fine, especially Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as per usual.

Anthony Minghella's directing was outstanding, as was the cinematography. Their opening battle sequence was a horrifying stunner.

Cons: Nicole Kidman. I find her wooden throughout and she and Law share no chemistry whatsoever, which renders their longing for true love story impotent, thus killing off a major theme of the movie. And she was in full makeup even when she was struggling in poverty and famine. What gives? i guess her contract specifies she must look radiant at all times.

The neverending monologues about the ravages of war were over the top. I get it. Stop Pontificating Already. As timely as this theme is, it is overplayed. I was reminded of Braveheart where Mel Gibson gives the same 'freedom' speech three-hundred times. I get it. I get it. I get it. Nuff said.

The battle scenes replete with thousands of extras and the overall theme of the movie gave it a poor man's Gone With the Wind feel.

The gifted and classically beautiful Nicole Kidman plays the genteel Ada Monroe a Charleston native who is transplanted to idyllic Cold Mountain, N.C. with her reverend father Donald Sutherland on the eve of the commencement of the Civil War.  An interaction with local lad Inman played by Jude Law leads to a brief platonic romantic interlude as he marches off to war.  She implores him to come back to her and he vows to do so.

The naive enthusiasm of the Southern boys for war soon leads to the ravages of bloody battle.  Law suffers through wounds and battles and decides to desert and return home.  Meanwhile back in Cold Mountain, with the slaves emancipated, the farms are not being tended and people are starving.  Kidman, whose father has passed away is ill equipped to fend for herself.  She is rescued by a very effective Renee Zellweger playing the down home country girl Ruby Thewes who comes to live with her and together they forge a hardscrabblelife together on Kidman's farm.

All the while, Law encounters the horrors of war on his journey back home.  He encounters drifting deserters, fatherless children, marauding soldiers and a society destroyed.  He interacts with both Natalie Portman and personal fave Giovanni Ribisi on his trek who both give good performances in a supporting role to the story.

His journey finally brings him back to Kidman and Cold Mountain where he finds that things have changed rather dramatically.

Rene Zellweiger is a great as Ruby, the rough but tender hearted southern gal. The story continues to move along, almost like the Odysseus tale of the man trying to fight his way back home.

- Sara (Natalie Portman) shoots (and kills) the only soldier compassionate enough to keep her baby warm. This is after Inman (Jude) had already disarmed the poor bastard down to his underpants.

- Rev. Monroe (Donald Sutherland) bites the big one after lingering outside during nasty weather. When will the old geezers learn it's not safe to play in the rain at their age?

- Cow (cow) gets sawed into bits at the hands of Inman (Jude) and Junior (Giovanni Ribissi). Don't worry folks, this takes place after the cow bit the big one.

- Ferry girl (Jena Malone) gets shot dead after suggesting a $30 ""donation"" in exhange for happy fun time at the love shack. Watch as Rev. Veasey's (Phillip Seymour Hoffan) face turns from the expression of a giddy boy awaiting the arrival of Santa Claus on Christmas Eve to giddy boy realizing it's Michael Jackson coming down his chimney instead.

- Kidman's transformation from proper lady to useful woman? Until she's shown me she can decapitate a rooster, she hasn't graduated Useful University.

- I didn't see the word ""documentary"" any where on the poster for this film. Perhaps the people that are whining about the historical depictions should stop and worry about the textbooks utilized in classrooms instead.

After about five minutes, though, you could predict the outcome which really dragged on. What was personally offensive to me was the depiction of a pastor as a drunk, womanizing hypocrite. While I'm certain that there have been a few of these in history, I have to wonder why Hollywood always depicts them this way?. My question is why we don't ever see a Rabbi being ridiculed?

  Other problems with the movie include the accents of Nicole and Rene which are almost impossible to understand. Also, the Southern men of this era were raised to be gentlemen. The bloodthirsty killers of Southern Army deserters are difficult to believe. This movie should not be rented or bought. It is poorly written and directed.",1099267200,10,834,4.777777777777778

The narrative and performances fill in for a somewhat predictable storyline.  It may be a bit disappointing to people expecting a hardcore civil war movie but it keeps its promise to all those who went into it for the romance.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman have chemistry.  Renee Zellweger steals the show.

Storyline:  Jude Law plays a man madly in love with Kidman who must keep his promise to return. He goes AWOL to keep his promise after three years of service to the Union.  Much of the movie captures the challenges he faces when finding his way back to his sweetheart.  The director has used Law's journey back to show the emotional mood and economical hardships of the people in a war stricken America.  On the other side in Cold Mountain, Zellweger transforms Kidman from a proper lady to a useful woman who can be self sufficient and not rely on a man to take care of her.

  The stars came up with some of their best work considering Jude Law(Inman)is English & Nicole Kidman (Ada) is Australian.  They both play Southerners convincingly to my untrained ear.
  Briefly, Ada & Inman fall in love virtually in a matter of days. The war comes & Inman leaves. Weeks turn into years. Yet they both remain steadfast. The war is obviously lost & Inman deserts, starting his long odyssey home. That is the focus of the movie. Will he make it? Is he dead? Probably. But Ada never loses hope. Another story is the relationship that develops between Ada & Ruby, a kind of goofy role for Renee Zellwegger. She is a woman who appears out of nowhere to help Ada, a southern belle with no pratical skills, keep her home during the war. They develop a strong bond of friendship.
  The backstory & interviews on the dvd are interesting & instructive. It goes into some detail comcerning a real life incident that happened during the war. Federal troops dug a long tunnel under a fortified rebel position. They loaded it with explosives & blew it up. This is considered the greatest man-made explosion in history up to that time.

2015669,3,B0001MDP36,"This is both the best and the worst Civil War/Love Story film I've ever seen.  Quite simply, I've never watched another movie that left me with the question ""What did I just see?"" ringing so strongly in my head.

There are elements of this film that seem designed for sophisticated film audiences.  There are other elements that are going to be satisfying to serious Civil War history buffs.  There are also elements that seem designed for gum-cracking 15 year old girls.  In this mix, there is an often beautiful movie suffering from an identity crisis.

Is it an art film?  Is it a history film?  Is it a standard Hollywood formula blockbuster?  The truth is, it's all three, and it remains conflicted and somewhat confused between these three identities for the duration of the film.

On the up side, the film's portrayal of the filthy, bloody desperation of 1864 is spot on.  Never before has a film been so frank and forthright about the actual living conditions of Civil War soldiers, or as unflinching from the actual nature of Civil War combat, which was at times as hellish and terrible as any human experience to date.

As for the question of desertion, by 1864 parts of the South were starving.  Men were leaving for home not because they missed their wives and sweethearts, but because their families were desperately begging them to come home to put in crops, plow fields and bring in harvests.  The currency was crashing in runaway inflation, and it was their family's economic desperation that tore most deserters away from their duty, not emotional desires.  This film does a fine job of portraying that desperate time.

I also can't fault the actors.  All the performances are first rate, and while I did find the superstar faces somewhat distracting from the ""history film"" experience, I guess it was really just the heavy-handed directing, especially where the romantic odyssey was concerned, that brought me to the brink of nausea at times.  I can empathize with love at first sight, and with the innocent ardour of a simpler time, but when these are repeatedly fed to me with a firehose and a baseball bat, I can't help but rebel.

Characters seemed to appear out of nowhere with no explanation and many seemed to have no purpose, I don't know if the book is any better but I have been put off even approaching it.",1097971200,10,505,4.685393258426966
2015671,5,B0001MDP36,"I chose not to see this movie in the theater mainly because I did not consider Nicole Kidman to be a very talented actress. She is quite nice to look at, but I do not recall any of her previous films being very good.

Well, I must say, she was actually pretty convincing in her role as the pampered daughter of a minister in the Civil War south. Of course, Jude Law is worthy of his acclaim as an up-and-coming actor, having previously performed quite well in Gattaca. And Renee Zellweiger was totally deserving of her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. All the minor roles were cast and performed delightfully well.

Two things about this movie stand out (and are making me seriously consider purchasing it): the music score and the excellent cinematography. I was amazed to learn much of it was filmed in Romania, which made a very believable North Carolina. The music score is similar to O Brother, Where Art thou, with  Bluegrass, American Spiritual, and a bit of Celtic mixed in. I love the main theme, performed by Alison Krausse and Sting.

Not only is this a high quality film, but it is fun to watch. Law's character has many Odyssey-like adventures as he fights to return to his lost love. A preacher caught up in Sin and a hick Bounty Hunter (cast perfectly as Giovanni Ribisi) provide a nice element of comedy to an otherwise dreary story. But overall, I did not find myself saddened or depressed at the end, but rather satisfied that life went on despite all the tragedy that occurred.

The only thing even close to its greatness, is probably Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List.

It takes a big/mature heart and good understanding of life to really appreciate its power, behind apparent calmness. Or in other words, you need to sit down, relax and watch this movie.

Then a soldier deserts to return to his sweetheart, and from there on it's a series of vignettes about the events - ranging from morbidly depressing to terribly morbid - that befall the characters. One begins to feel that perhaps life might be more pleasant on the battlefields than off, which probably wasn't the intended message.

The film's biggest problem is its construction of disjointed scenes. Each time we return to the characters they've moved on from where we previously left them and are doing something else, which removes any chance of emotional concern. There's little to care about anywhere. On the surface it's a love story but we see so little chemistry and interaction between the two people that it comes off less like a love story and more like a compulsion of some kind. If they were real life people I'd suggest counseling.

The writing is terrible, the characters can't wait to tell us as quickly as possible that they're stereotypes formed from the scraps of older stories. Ava is a refined Southern belle incapable of looking after herself; a Scarlet without the attitude. Ruby is a feisty broad with a heart of gold, the no-nonsense gal pal every insipid heroine needs. Ava's father is a hearty old Southern gentleman, a la Colonel Saunders, and so forth.

None of them are especially likeable, but that they come across as ridiculous is worse. Nicole Kidman's character seems to demonstrate nothing more than the importance of always being fashionably dressed and well-groomed, even while doing farm labor and starving. I've never cared for Renee Zellweger's acting and her completely over the top `gimme my DAYM OSCAH!!!' speeches drove me nuts - whatever happened to being able to express emotion subtly as a requirement in acting? - although I will admit they did add some life to the whole dreary thing. Jude Law comes off the best, mostly he's fleeing from one god-awful situation after another and doesn't have as much time to make a fool of himself.

2015683,5,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" tells the story of two would-be lovers (Law and Kidman)  who on the eve of their relationship blossoming into a full blown love affair are separated for years by The Civil War.  Many viewers find immediate problems with this premise, as the two are more in love with the potential and promise of a relationship than the actual person to whom they swore devotion.  The problem comes from the years that pass and the burdens both must overcome to remain true to the other.  Many people just don't buy it, assuming  the two would have moved past thoughts of the other sometime during their years apart.

The majority of the film deals with the Law's long, Homeric return from his battles intercut with visions of Kidman's life, full of isolation and toil (until she is joined by a live-off-the-land savior played by Renee Zellwegger).  The educated and cultured Kidman soon trades her life of pianos and novels for one of scarecrows and winter gardens.

Law's trip home, through the foothills of the Appalachians, is at the same time picturesque and bitterly painful.  As a deserter, he must avoid most of society and thus survives on a scavenger's diet of what he can find or catch.  He encounters many eccentric figures found among the war-torn South.  Despite what the Oscar nominations will tell you (Law and Zellwenger), the real acting is done by these tangential characters in minor roles (especially Phillip Hoffman as a preacher fleeing from his sins and Natalie Portman as a new bride whose husband will never return from the war).

""Cold Mountain"" obviously fixes its cannon directly on war, pointing out all the lives destroyed among the citizens of the South.  As we saw with Gangs of New York, this film also muddies the water on the morality of the Civil War, showing us both evil deeds and righteous acts by the North and South alike.  It is not as simple as saying ""the Union was right and the Confederates were wrong"".  Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) gives viewers another film set directly in the middle of a great war that focuses not on the events of that war, but rather on the lives of people affected by the turmoil around them.  A powerful piece of historical fiction.",1093824000,4,2215,4.7441253263707575

I think this is one of the more realistic, epic war stories I've seen in a while.  The movie's characters are driven by the urge to survive the disasters visited upon them (brought on by the Civil War), and faith in love is what they use to keep their courage to live on from giving out.

Nicole Kidman and Jude Law play Ada Munroe and W.P. Inman (respectively) and their romance has barely begun to bud before he's shipped off to fight in the Civil War.  Ada is a classic southern belle and a minister's daughter who has just moved to the rural town of Cold Mountain from Charleston.  After Ada's father dies, she's left in charge of their farm and she finds survival difficult.  In her words, she says, ""I can embroider but I can't darn.  I can arrange cut flowers but I can't grow them... I can name the principle rivers in Europe but don't ask me to name a single stream in this county.""  With no hope to fall back on, she relies on her fond memories of Inman to lend her enough faith to continue on and learn to survive in Cold Mountain.  Nicole Kidman portrays the helpless southern belle perfectly, and her character makes a believable transition into a credible farm owner.

Renee Zellweger steals the show with her Ruby Thewes--a young, no-nonsense working woman is sent to Ada to help her run the farm.  Ruby teaches Ada how to get her hands dirty and work.  Renee lends her character terrific spunk, and plays the role of a hard-on-the-outside, but soft-on-the-inside tomgirl wonderfully.

The real love story is between Ada and Ruby.  It is, of course, not romantic love, but familial love.  Nicole and Renee pair together wonderfully and make a credible duo of two women trying to survive winter at their farm, and it's heartwarming to watch the two grow closer to form a new family.  Indeed, the real love that blossoms in this movie isn't between Ada and Inman, it's between Ada and Ruby.  It's also terrific fun to watch how Ruby's influence toughens up Ada, and Ada softens Ruby.  In the beginning of their relationship, for example, Ruby criticizes Ada for toting around a novel, since she can't see the point of carrying around a book you can't write in.  Before long, Ada begins reading to Ruby at night and Ruby ends up pestering Ada to keep reading instead of going to sleep.  You definitely see how the two rub off on each other through the course of the film.

Natalie Portman has a short performance, but it's the most emotionally charged and adult role I've yet to see her perform.  She was fantastic--and this is coming from somebody who has questioned her acting ability countless times.  Ruby's father Stobrod (Brenden Gleeson) and Rev. Veasey (Phillip Hoffman) were also wonderfully cast, and those two are probably the film's two most colorful characters.

Jude Law's Inman does the same with Ada as she does with Inman.  Ada's picture and letters remind him of something worth returning to--thus, gives him a reason to strive to survive the war.  Jude's performance is somber, subtle, serene on the surface, but intense beneath the surface.  He plays the role of the silent, conflicted warrior perfectly, and throughout his performance, you feel that his character is surviving and carrying on only to complete his return to Cold Mountain, as per Ada's request that he come back to her.  He plays his tormented character fantastically, and not to mention realistically.

The lovers are more symbols life before the war to each other than they are actual lovers.  Each lover represents to the other hope that life can go back to the way it was (both possessed memories of each other during happier times before the war began), and, in their minds, their reunion symbolizes the end of the war.  So, it's hardly a mystery as to why two people who were barely lovers and barely knew each other would cling so desperately onto the memories they have of each other as a beacon for hope.

The music was a definite bonus.  I was very impressed with the score and the songs.  In the middle of watching Cold Mountain with my husband, we both mentioned how good the music was and how we wouldn't mind purchasing the soundtrack.  It's not everyday that a movie's soundtrack impresses us so early on during the film.  They capture the feel of the South beautifully, and the music is atmospheric, ambient, bittersweet, lonely, and lovely--just like the film.",1093824000,3,4518,4.689086294416244

I found the story interesting, it was just so very long that I sometimes wished it had been trimmed somewhere.
Jude Law did an especially good job with his American accent and his role, Renee Zellwegger portrayed an interesting but somewhat irritating characted. I had forgotten that Natalie Portman was in the cast, her role is short but quite a change of pace for me.
It appeared to me that the producers went all out in detailing the movie, things such as Miss Ada with ink on her left hand from writing a letter (Nicole Kidman is left handed)blood on the ground, weapons,buildings, lot's of things.

My husband and I sat through it hoping that the near-constant scenes of tragedy, brutality and lewdness would be somehow softened by a satisfactory ending... but the last five minutes of the movie dashed those hopes and made the previous 2 1/2 hours a total waste of time.

There were moments of humor and tenderness. But the main focus of the movie is not what happens to the characters. The main focus is to drive home to the viewers the tragedy, futility and brutality of war. And the movie's creators drive it home... over... and over.. and over... and over and over again. There is an excellently portrayed battle scene at the beginning which makes that point very well, and they could have then focused on actually telling a fulfilling story, but they didn't.

2015700,5,B0001MDP36,"I have placed this film as one of my favorite films of all time because it works on so many levels. This film is visually stunning, musically magical, written beautifully and is most importantly a powerful message about how life was during the 1864 battle of Petersburg, Virginia.

The cast in this movie is fantastic, not one of the actors fails in their role and combined these brilliant actors weave together a phenomenal tale of the harshness of life on ""Cold Mountain."" Nicole Kidman is a beautiful, educated city girl who has moved to the country with her pastor father, played by Donald Sutherland. Kidman represents purity and the ultimate in feminine weakness as expected during the 1800's, she can look fresh and pretty, play beautiful music, read and speak French but she was never taught anything else. As the movie advances Kidman adapts to her changing role and is absolutely convincing in her strength as a woman during a time when the least was expected of one. Kidman falls for a character played by Jude Law and a great love story unfolds in the midst of war. Jude Law's character plays at war but never becomes convinced of its value towards humanity so he pays a very high price. Although the love story in this film is touching and emotionally significant I found it paled in comparison to the heroic efforts found in the side story.

Renee Zellweger is a central character to this film and pulls off an excellent performance as the tough and robust country woman who saves Kidman's farm. Zellweger transforms herself into a woman who verges on manhood, gritty and absolutely unfeminine for the time period, but she is the perfect savior next to Kidman and with her role makes a great statement about the worthiness of women during the era. Many other actors make brief but powerful appearances starting with Eileen Atkins, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, and others. Each supporting character strengthens the story and is found to have a reason for being cast in the film rather than just appearing at random.

This film is directed by Anthony Minghella and he has done an excellent job bringing to life the harshness of life during the war of 1864 in Virginia, he captures the beauty that surrounds all of the hate and shows how nature has its own hand at what unfolds. Minghella brings forth the message that women were nothing without men to support them but that the strong ones managed to survive when they were willing to take on the additional burdens of ""manhood"" while their men were being killed at war. The hatred and prejudice of the time is handled with intense scenes of slaves being killed, families being tortured and with realistically impressive war depictions. Minghella creates paintings with almost every shot. So often epic sagas such as this one fail because the expectations run high but I could find nothing in this film that failed, it is simply amazing.",1093305600,4,2928,4.817097415506958
2015701,5,B0001MDP36,"I read this book following the movie, which I watched numerous times. I found the characters to be utterly charming and found myself wishing to be part of that life and times, no matter how turbulent they were. In reading the book, I wanted to find out more about the characters portrayed in the movie, what brought them to this point in which they were being exposed. Why was Ada so pampered? Why was Inman so damn appealing? Why was Ruby so strong? You're able to taste the food and feel the weather and feel the rough craftsmanship of the everyday living. If something needed to be done, you had to do it or you would starve, or be dirty or be thirsty, etc... To have to know about where you live and how that land lives so you can live with it in harmony. It sort of skips those detailed-details in the movie. The book is a bit slower, but because it happened so long ago, I feel it would be necessary to describe things in this meticulous manner. I find it easy to compare the war stories with everyday living in middle class life today. At least then, there was chivalry and polite society. Today is nothing but money, unproffesionalism and rudeness. If this book were about just the civil war it would be in another class, but by adding this personal touch, it screams need, commitment and survival in its rawest form. PS.

Always coordinated, always clean. Always looking like she is ready for a photo shoot - in the middle of the Civil War no less!  Law is pretty good here, so I will leave him alone.

Civil War reenactors work for free and the real Cold Mountain is in North Carolina. The accents, especially Nicole Kidman's, are atrocious. The script itself was sanitized to make it politically correct (the whole war is about slavery) and Inman is quoted as saying he doesn't believe in the war. (Not in the book) Very poor job. Read the book, skip the movie",1092873600,7,515,4.733333333333333
2015705,4,B0001MDP36,"The movie is pretty faithful to the book (if you've read the book, you'll understand why I was hoping against hope they MIGHT ""go Hollywood"" at the end).  It's beautifully shot and the scenery is gorgeous.  The music adds a lot to the whole setting of the story (Allison Krauss is  not the only musician in this genre, but she's one of the best and perfect for the film), and what a fabulous cast!

This is the best acting I've ever seen from Jude Law-- he should try being guileless more often; when he adds his usual saracastic/cynical expression (I suppose in an attempt to seem witty) he often seems shrill as he did in ""Wilde"" and ""Talented Mr. Ripley.""  Here he's very moving, and he even made me cry in one scene where he was missing his love, Ada.

Nicole Kidman is unsurprisingly radiant-- she's such a versatile actress whose talents are sometimes overlooked because of her beauty.  But Renee Zellweger is most impressive.  She is much more than an ingenue, she's a little chameleon.  If anyone has earned the right to Meryl Streep's crown it may be her-- despite her lack of formal training.  She brought tears to my eyes more than once, and my mother used up most of a box of tissues. Philip Seymour Hoffman is, as always, one of the great pleasures of life.

The movie is pretty long and in my opinion takes too long to get started.  There's a long section of bombings and warfare early on that do nothing really but establish what Inman is deserting.  I think a little of this goes a long way.  There can't be too many people who would go to see this film (or rent it) who haven't seen Gone with the Wind or the PBS ""Civil War.""  I'm not saying omit it, but it could be shortened.

Also the book leaps somehow more quickly from episode to episode, and the mythic elements of Odysseus' return are much more clear.  Sometimes in the film if you don't know the book the episodes seem random instead of leading inevitably home.  The film does heighten the role of the antagonist, but I didn't mind that; it's probably necessary for film and even helped the ""war is hell"" theme (more than the battle scenes I think).

All in all, this is solid and powerful.  A beautiful weepy with enough explosions and action for the boys, too.",1092787200,2,2238,4.452088452088452

Renee Zellweger steals the show with her brilliant interpretation of ""Ruby""! The critics are silenced as Ruby spits, swears, and melts our hearts in convincing style. Zellweger doesn't portray this character, she becomes her and adds breath and life to this tough-minded, practical, hard-working ragamuffin.

Equally riveting is the performance of Natalie Portman as the desperate widow protecting her new-born baby and scraping a living out of a hard-gravel southern farm. Inman visits her and both their lives are forever touched by the encounter.

Nevertheless I don't really appreciate too many movies, because there really aren't very many out there, in my opinion.  Regardless this movie tops my list.  The cinematography is nothing short of amazing and the subject matter is seemingly flawless.  I don't like fictions too much, but this movie is something of a carbon copy of reality.

As a college history major, it is hard to imagine what life was like during the 19th century, how people suffered, how they ate and managed their lives.  This movie depicts these issues without sensationalizing for reviews.

Also, this movie illustrates human morality.  This movie is like a seminar on such issues as justice, sexuality, war and society in general.  Is there such a thing as ultimate right and wrong?  In a nutshell, what this movie does is depict that human beings are ultimately flawed and that in order to transcend this reality one has to work and struggle very, very hard in life to even achieve the simplest goal.

2015710,5,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" is a spectacular achievement in filmmaking, certainly one of the most impressive films I've seen in quite a while.  The movie is epic in every sense of the word, and instantly draws you into a deeply beautiful and deeply flawed world.  The movie has bascially two simultaneous storylines; one is about Confederate soldier ""WP Inman"" who will embark on an Oddyssey-like journey to hell and back in order to return home to the woman he loves.  The other is a wonderful and complex story about the relationship between two women in desperate times.

  The scale and ambitions of this movie are grand, and would have certainly collapsed on itself under the hands of less capable filmmakers.  I am deeply impressed that they were able to make such a long, complex, and involved film as coherent and spectacular to watch as they were able to.  It IS indeed a long film, but you will not be bored.  The director handles the storyline with such mastery that we are in his spell and cannot extricate ourselves.

  This is especially surprisingly considering how

little ""action"" there is in the movie.  The opening battle scene of the Siege of Petersburg is utterly stunning to watch, but that's about it for battle scenes.  The rest of the movie is much more subtle, and the most exciting things are done with a look of the eye, with innuendo, with what is not said.  I found it similar in style and tone with the also amazing film ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"".  This then brings me to the acting.  Fantastic acting from top to bottom; bravo to the filmmakers for not blowing all the money and effort on gratuitous special effects, and instead letting the actors ACT.  And act they do.

  Jude Law is extremely impressive in his role as the poigant and determined Inman.  He never overacts, letting his eyes do most of the storytelling of his internal turmoils.  The depth of his acting skills comes through in this film very well, and he portrays brilliantly that tinge of sadness and poignancy to his character, which we as the audience can't quite put our finger on, but is vital to the film.  Nicole Kidman's (as Ada) southern accent is less than impressive, but the rest of her acting is quite satisfying.

  The real revelation and show-stealer however, is the incredible acting of Renee Zellweger (as Ruby).  Zellweger completely blew me away with her utterly convincing portrayal of an irresistibly likeable character.  Ruby is the tough-as-nails farmgirl/tomboy who comes to ""rescue"" Ada after Ada's father dies, and there is no one to tend to the farm.  Ada is a proper lady who plays piano with no knowledge of farming.  Together the girls survive and thrive, and develop a very special relationship.

  I found an undeniably romantic subtext between Ada and Ruby's relationship, and frankly I'm rather surprised that very few people have commented on this.  Personally I felt the subtext was so strong that if it were any stronger, it would become ""text"".  To me it's far and away the most fascinating part of the story; although Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's respective characters are supposed to be star-crossed soulmates, I found that Kidman has far more chemistry with Zellweger than she ever did with Law.  Ada and Ruby's chemistry crackles and pops like a warm fire on a cold winter night.  From the moment Ruby walked onto the farm I suspected, and my suspicion only grew as the movie progressed.  Consider the scene when she dreamily listens to Ada play the piano; consider the ""bracelet scene""; consider towards the end when Ruby steps aside and lets Inman and Ada have the hut to themselves, whilst Ruby goes to the other hut to sleep with her father.  A single tear rolls down her cheek.  It seems clear to me that Ruby is completely in love with Ada.  And frankly, I am insulted by the heterosexual relationship and husband which were eventually forced on her character, and forced down our throats.  It felt artificial, absurd, contrived, and completely inconsistent with the development of her character.  I'm not saying she and Ada should have gotten together (since Ada clearly is not lesbian), but I would have preferred to leave Ruby's sexual orientation much more ambiguous and letting the audience decide at the end of the movie.

  Natalie Portman has a very good cameo in the film.  In fact all the supporting and cameo roles were done very well.  Portman, my favourite actress and dream lover, presented the biggest temptation to Inman on his journey home, even bigger than the ""sirens"" who literally threw themselves at Inman.  And frankly, if it had been me in Natalie Portman's cabin, I don't think I would have ever gotten to Cold Mountain :-p

  Another thing I have to point out is the utterly incredible music of the movie.  Typically I never mention the music in any of my movie reviews, but in this movie the music so well done that it adds a whole other dimension of storytelling.  Especially good is the heartbreakingly poignant, aetherally sung tune that accompanied the opening battle scene, and later scenes as well.  The folksy bluegrass music in general worked spectacularly to transport the audience headfirst into the world of the Civil War South, which the film has so meticulously and richly re-created.

  Another thing I loved about ""Cold Mountain"" is its balanced storytelling; the most beautiful and ugliest sides of the South are both on display, as are those of the North.

  ""Cold Mountain"" is many things.  It is a classic Romeo-and-Juliet love story, a Civil War epic, an homage to Homer's Odyssey, and possibly a lesbian romance.  But however you watch it, it will amaze you and stay with you.",1092441600,,5664,4.797101449275362
2015711,5,B0001MDP36,"War is terrible. What an understatement! Today, with high tech weaponry, and a news media careful of viewers' sensibilities, it is difficult to understand, in the gut, how much horror is involved in war - unless, of course, we lose a loved one. And the War Between The States, which destroyed a generation, was one of the most terrible.

""Cold Mountain"" opens with scenes from the 1864 Siege of Petersburg. The footage portrays the brutal effects of explosions, with the resulting burning violence which tears men's bodies to pieces. The chaotic battle scenes, the blood, filth, mindlessness and terror of close combat, are some of the most realistic I have ever seen. Just before the battle, confederate soldier Inman, (Jude Law), receives a letter from his beloved, Ada, asking him to come home to her. ""Mr. Inman,"" she writes, ""If you are fighting, stop fighting. If you are marching, stop marching. Come home to me, please. This is my request. Come home to me."" Weary, after years at the front, and badly wounded after the siege, he escapes from a field hospital and begins his odyssey home to Cold Mountain, NC....and to Ada, whose image has accompanied him for long years, and ""prevented him from falling into a darkness."" He treks across the war ravaged land, meeting murderous men from both North & South, who want to ""put him in the ground."" Along the way, he is sometimes nursed and cared for by desperately lonely women left behind. But his goal is always Ada and Cold Mountain.

Ada Monroe, (Nicole Kidman), a southern belle from Charleston, moved to Cold Mountain along with her father, a minister, (Donald Sutherland), shortly before war broke out. Both Inman & Ada were too shy and inexperienced to express their growing feelings toward each other until he marched off, amongst friends & flags, to fight for glory. The two were finally able to communicate their emotions. Although the couple had spent little ""real time"" together, sometimes a look, a gesture, a few words of mutual understanding, can form a bond which days, hours and minutes cannot. Time to live and love, a most precious commodity, is a reoccurring theme throughout the film. When Ada's tells her father that she and Inman only spent a brief period together, he responds, ""I lost your mother after 22 months of marriage. It was enough for a lifetime.""

When Ada's father dies, she struggles to survive alone, with no money, in a town where all able-bodied men have gone to war. She was educated to be an accomplished lady, not to work a farm. Then Ruby, (Renee Zellweger), a tough talkin' woman-of-all-trades enters, to help out. Zellweger is extraordinary as an abused woman with a hard shell surrounding a sensitive soul and a kind heart. As cliched as this role sound, Zellweger is an original - a real scene stealer.

Kidman is luminous as Ada, and Jude Law's is wonderful in his portrayal of Inman, the intense young man, painfully disillusioned but determined to survive. Gabriel Yared's wonderful, frequently melancholy folk music from the Civil War period, adds beauty and authenticity. Bring tissues - this is a real tearjerker! Bravo to director Anthony Minghella who remains true to Charles Frazier's excellent novel of the same title! Highly recommended!

2015712,3,B0001MDP36,"I saw COLD MOUNTAIN in the theater without having read any professional critics' reviews. I decided to go into this possible Oscar contender with as open a mind as possible. The result, alas, was a measure of disappointment.

It certainly wasn't too long and boring, as a lot of people have said of THE ENGLISH PATIENT. No, the problem with this movie is that its dramatic core seems to be missing. Okay, the story is how wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) wants to get back to his love Ada (Nicole Kidman), but has to go through an ODYSSEY-type set of adventures to do so. Except, in the scenes set before Inman goes off to war, we never get a sense of real romantic chemistry between these two (although Law and Kidman certainly try to pull it off): neither when they first meet, nor when Inman departs from Ada. Their initial meeting scenes are much too brief (truncated, perhaps?), and if we don't believe the central romance at its heart, we surely don't believe in Inman's dogged determination to get back to a love that he hardly even knows. Throughout the central passages of the film, I never felt anything truly at stake throughout Inman's journey, and for me that is a real letdown.

If the film is pretty much dead at its dramatic center, at least its edges are full of life. I don't know if Renee Zellweger deserved her Oscar for THIS role as a no-nonsense mountain girl that stays with Ada---it's not a great role, and hardly an acting stretch for her---but she still livens up the film considerably by her sheer personality when she arrives on the scene. Her scenes with her father, especially, are a hoot---in a good way. She is certainly fun to watch, even if it's debatable whether she's really necessary in the film (but then, I can't say I've read Charles Frazier's book). Indeed, some of the characters Inman meets along his quest are interesting: some comic (Philip Seymour Hoffman's Reverend Veasey), some poignant (Natalie Portman's lonely single mother Sara). And the film is, once again, handsomely well-mounted by Minghella and gloriously shot by cinematographer John Seale, esp. in the impressive opening battle scene (with one of the best explosion shots I've ever seen) and the shots of snowy mountain peaks at the end.

All in all, COLD MOUNTAIN is the classic case of a movie that has some very good parts which simply do not add up to a satisfying whole. It has great individual moments, but the central romance is thin and underdramatized (although Minghella certainly tries to make up for the missing passion at the beginning when Ada and Inman meet again at the end), and thus the glue that would sew together the disparate parts simply isn't there. One of Minghella's previous films, THE ENGLISH PATIENT---which won a ton of Oscars in 1996---is a much better film with a vastly more coherent story and convincing central romance than.

2015727,1,B0001MDP36,"As founder of the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com), I know something about feature movies and this one is a BIG disappointment. For one it is in fact long and seems even longer, moving at a glacial pace. This would be fine, if for our time and money, something of real character develops, but folks, I could not (try as I might) get involved with this story.

Jude Law (who starred in such classic films as Enemy at the Gates, and who is a personal favorite of mine), here plays a man of few words, who ends up looking awkward and out of place in the film.

Another personal favorite, Rene Zellweger, plays a character so over-the-top, that it is almost cartoonish, and embarrassing to watch, not something that adds anything at all to her film legacy. As for Nicole Kidman (who I can take or leave), she looks good (as usual), but her character is just too unreal for a woman trying to survive in a developing country. As for her much trumped up brief nudity: give me a break! it does not carry the movie. Aside from these stars, I cant find another actor in this film that distinguishes themselves so that I would EVER want to see this film again.

Beyond that, the film is poorly put together, with crude segues, and a plot that does not even amount to what we could expect from a good session of the Waltons. The meaningless ending appears abruptly, makes little story sense, and is a poor reward for staying to the end of this seeming endless movie. What was all the hype about? This movie is forgettable and I am doing just that, ASAP.

I saw this film five times at the movie theater and was utterly swepped away by its beautiful setting, acting, and story.  The movie is set in the deep south during the days of the civil war.  It centers around two characters.  Innman, a troubled soldier who leaves the war for home to Ada, a grieving woman who after the loss of her father (Donald Sutherland) is alone to fight for her life.  Soon Ada is aided by a drifter, Ruby (Renee Zellwegger) who teaches Ada the grueling tasks on obtaining a farm.  This film teaches valuable lessons about honor and courage unlike any film.

Nicole Kidman: Gorgeous! Other than that, completely forgettable. Renee Zellwegger: Breathed a little life into this turgid tale but was a bit over the top. I've told my wife that I will NEVER see another Anthony Minghella film! The pacing was slow as molasses in January and the story was never involving. The idea that these two characters could fall so hopelessly in love after ten minutes of face-time was too hard for me to swallow.

2015731,4,B0001MDP36,"Anthony Minghella's tragedy of the weary soldier who only longs to be with his promised love. The theme is a variation on Homer's Odyssey where, after years of surviving the depravities of war, the hero-soldier undertakes a perilous journey home; reuniting with his loved one only after many trials and tribulations. Although the theme isn't new, the script properly grasps the attitudes and mannerisms of the time. The cinematography and editing is top knotch.

Nicole Kidman plays Ada, a preacher's daughter who, in 1860, moves with her father to the rustic bliss of Cold Mountain, North Carolina. Ada falls in love with Inman (Jude Law) but, before their love can be consummated, Inman answers to the call of duty and joins the Confederate Army. Before he leaves, Ada promises to wait for his return and to marry him. By 1864, Inman is a broken man: shocked by the brutal realities of war and seeing no purpose to the carnage. He sees the Confederacy as doomed and, longing for Ada, resigns himself to deserting the army. He begins his long perilous journey from the frontlines to his home. In the meantime, things go from bad to worse in Cold Mountain and Ada is forced to hold the house on her own. Exploiting her fears that Inman may be dead, prospective suitors unwelcomingly court Ada. In the meantime, Ada welcomes a runaway girl named Ruby (Renee Zellweger)to help her with the farm's chores. The climax of the film rises as Inman comes closer to home. Sadly for both Ada and Inman, their reunion is bittersweet.

The acting is great although I think Nicole Kidman was too well groomed for her role. Even if immaculate and beautiful, women of the 1860s didn't look as if they just came out of a Hollywood beauty salon: especially those who lived and worked in a rural setting.  I also found the final erotic scene to be at odds with her character and the theme the story tried to convey. Ada is supposed to be a virgin patiently waiting for her man: Ingham is the only man she ever knew.  Despite this plot and theme, the film presents her in a passionate love making scene that doesn't fool anyone. Only someone who passed their time dilligently reading the Karma Sutra or flattening straw with a farm hand back in the barn would have the sexual maturity the innocent Ada seemingly possesses in the film.  Finally, please spare us from such visuals in the first place: does every film involving a love story have to have an overdone and gratuitous sex scene?  This is supposed to be an old-fashioned Gone With the Wind-style romantic tragedy and not an erotic drama!

Again, the story is a thematic variation from the Odyssey. The warrior-hero leaves to face the horrors of war and returns only after a long life-changing journey. A great romantic tragedy that appeals to both men and women. I strongly recommend it.",1091404800,2,2827,4.7105263157894735

2015733,1,B0001MDP36,"This film became literally unwatchable after the first 35 minutes. It felt so much like one of those PBS 'Mobile 5-Star Cinema' over-dramatic that I felt more inclined to change the channel rather hit 'Stop' on the DVD remote. ""Cold Mountain"" is easily, BY FAR, the most horrendous movie that I've seen this year. I'll explain my main beefs with this cut-of-the-mill love story:

 1) CASTING: Jude Law is British; Nicole Kidman is Australian; Donald Sutherland: obviously not a Southerner. All of these otherwise great actors just could not make 'it' happen. Their accents were forced and slothy --not fluid in the least. Furthermore, Law and Kidman shared very little chemistry; their conversations were very unnatural and, in effect, the love that they shared was entirely unbelievable. The first time they meet is laughable; there's so much drama but oh so little substance. And poor old Donald Sutherland: There's just something about him that does not exude 'the South;' I have yet to put my finger on it...

 2) ACTING: Shove this effort under the rug, kids. These are great actors in the wrong movie. Kidman resembles an almost valley girl Southerner; Jude Law always seems so confused about his mere existence in this film; Zellwegger tries her hardest, bless her heart --but none of them ever seem comfortable. Sutherland was atrocious is this movie.

 3) STORYLINE/ SCREENPLAY: Well, if you like Harlequin Romances, you'll be sympathetic toward the motive of this film. It's a hard-core love story; I can't say much more than that. The way that the movie unfolds, however, is tedious. It never acheives a flow; it's all unnecessarily chopped-up into little pieces. To clarify: Pulp Fiction was chopped-up into pieces, but big pieces. The effect of ""Cold Mountain"" is supposed to be a 'now-and-then' one, but is ultimately unsatisfying in its delivery.

 4) DIRECTING: Tony, Tony, Tony (should've been the title to my review perhaps? hahaha)... It's hard to explain how bad the cameraman wielded his machine. I'm not sure what he was thinking, but it's always as if the important things in a scene were sent off to the side. Close-ups were laughable and intentionally over dramatic. Many scenes has no begininning or end; it's like we're permitted to enter half-way into them. The will of Minghella was to emphasize drama, and he did it poorly. Plotline remained cut-of-the-mill --not what I've heard about the book.

 Folks, I've heard great things about ""Cold Mountain,"" the book. Though I have not read it, I'd suggest it --or ""Gigli,"" for that matter-- anyday over this shlock of a movie, for any attempt at art could not possibly be as admonishable as this film.",1091318400,17,2676,4.979820627802691

Nicole Kidman did not have much to work with and I thought she did well eventhough she did not fit the part in my eyes.

2015744,2,B0001MDP36,"**1/2 Based on the best-selling novel by Charles Frazier, Anthony Minghella's ""Cold Mountain"" is, like his earlier snooze-fest, ""The English Patient,"" one of those highbrow historical romances that only a Motion Picture Academy member could love.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play Inman and Ada, two Southerners whose budding romance is cut short when he goes off to fight in the Civil War.  Though the two ""lovers"" barely know one another, she spends years pining away for him, while he, eventually, deserts the battlefield in order to get back to her.  When her minister father dies unexpectedly, Ada, who has hitherto led a very sheltered life, is forced to fend for herself on the land he left her.  Eventually joining her in that endeavor is a feisty young woman named Ruby, played with a whole host of annoying, self-conscious mannerisms by the usually reliable Renee Zellweger.

In ambiance and plot, ""Cold Mountain"" feels an awful lot like a warmed over ""Gone With the Wind,"" right down to the Southern-belle-forced-to-demean-herself-to-survive scenario.  The difference is that the two main characters in ""Cold Mountain"" are completely uninteresting as people and thoroughly unconvincing as lovers.  In a film in which the driving force is supposed to be obsessive passion, it's odd that the romance is laid out in such lukewarm and sketchy terms.  It's hard to believe that a young man would risk execution for treason trying to get back to a woman he barely knows - and it's even harder for the audience to work up much personal stake in the outcome.  Ada is like a magnet drawing Inman to her, but, for the life of us, we can't figure out the attraction.  Law does reasonably well as a sort of anti-hero version of Odysseus, but Kidman fails to score as a charisma-challenged Penelope - or Scarlett O'Hara, if you prefer.

Another problem with ""Cold Mountain"" is that it overdoses on Southern-fried cornpone and backwater moonshine.  Every time Inman or Ada turn a corner, they seem to be confronted by yet another ""colorful"" Southern character - be it a fornicating preacher, a clan of promiscuous hillbillies, a fiddler-playing, ne'er-do-well daddy, or even the over-the-top Ruby herself, whose way with a folksy aphorism, after some initial appeal, eventually ends up setting the teeth on edge.  The film is a strangely schizophrenic one in that, while the lead characters are underdeveloped to the point of blandness, the secondary characters are overdrawn to the point of buffoonery.  The film, after awhile, begins to resemble the casting call for an out-of-town revival of Tennessee Williams.

There are a few good things about ""Cold Mountain.""  It doesn't shy away from some of the more brutal aspects of war and it deals head-on with the struggles the Southerners had to undergo being on the losing side.  Moreover, some of the vistas are attractive.  But, apart from a few effective moments, ""Cold Mountain,"" is little more than a boring, meandering, high-toned soap opera, just the kind of movie that makes Academy members sit up and take notice come nomination time (the film garnered seven nominations and one win - for Zellweger's performance).

Unable to express himself, Inman finds it difficult to express his feelings for Ada, which she eagerly returns with similar shyness. When the Civil War comes into Cold Mountain, Inman, along with a handful of others, enlists in the fight, leaving behind Ada just as they were about to embark on a passionate romance of their own. Over the next four years, Ada sends Inman letters of love and hope, even as her own life is beginning to fall apart. In the aftermath of the war, not to mention recovering from a gunshot wound, Inman decides to desert the Confederacy and return home to Cold Mountain. Along the way, Inman meets an assortment of colorful characters that alternately help and hinder his progress, including a young mother (Portman) and another reverend (Hoffman) of a town that Inman is passing through. Back in Cold Mountain, Ruby Thewes (Zellweger), a drifter and skilled farmhand, walks into Ada's life and helps her tend to the land, as well as protecting her from the lawmen (led by Winstone) who look to take over the nearly deserted town.
""Cold Mountain"", once again, comes from the Charles Frazier's best-selling novel of long-lost love, companionship, and redemption, set against the time of rapid morale loss of the South during the final moments of the Civil War. Writer/director Minghella does quite a job in adapting the book for the big screen. However, with exact attention to detail, magnificent casting, and source material ripe for the picking, ""Cold Mountain"" makes for a stirring success in every way imaginable.
While the film is exquisitely mounted and written, a good chunk of its power comes from the supporting cast, as Minghella took advantage of planting acting surprises around every corner. As Jude Law's Inman makes his pilgrimage to Cold Mountain, he meets up with the likes of fine actors as, once again, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Melora Walters, Jena Malone, and an excellent Natalie Portman. As for Nicole Kidman's internal journey of Ada, she encounters Donald Sutherland, Ray Winstone, Charlie Hunnam, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Brendan Gleeson, Ethan Suplee, and Jack White (of the White Stripes band). The community vibe of the actors is intoxicating, casting a spell over the film.
The three leads of ""Cold Mountain"" do not disappoint either, to say the least. Jude Law brings a quiet, hungry determination to his almost dialog-free role of Inman. Nicole Kidman tackles another accent and succeeds. Minghella has chosen her journey of Ada as the most profound of the story, and Kidman rises to the challenge elegantly, adding another notch to her impressive film career, not to mention coming off an Academy Award win for her role in ""The Hours"". Law and Kidman both shade their performances accordingly, staying true to their situation, which is even more heartbreaking and ultimately devastating to behold. The real soul of ""Cold Mountain"" is found in the Academy Award winning supporting performance of Renee Zellweger's Ruby. The brunt nature of Ruby is an element to Zellweger's acting. There are passionate performances all around, guided well by Minghella, but Zellweger is different and brilliant in her own unique cadence and posture.
In conclusion, ""Cold Mountain"" comes at a time when big battles and epic landscapes are all the rage. Through Anthony Minghella's ace direction, the film transforms from a prospective thudding tearjerker to something much more enriching and absorbing. ""Cold Mountain"" is a remarkable motion picture, and an unforgettable one at that. Especially since the film has top-notch talents from an all-star cast and the characters that they portray, riveting storytelling, and heartfelt emotion. I now own the 2-disc DVD, with features such as deleted scenes, ""making-of"" documentaries, storyboard comparisons, and much more. There will be no other film quite like ""Cold Mountain""!",1089849600,,5207,5.305084745762712

A story of war and loss. It is also a story of transformation. Ada is a rich girl with everything until civil war comes and all the men go to join it, including Inman, the fellow that Ada has set her eyes on. Their fleeting romance becomes a lifeline for them both. The cinematography is breathtaking and the direction flawless in my opinion. This one of the few times I feel that a movie actually lives up to its hype. I loved it, although I did cry quite a bit. I highly recommend it!",1089763200,,649,4.241935483870968

There is also a lot of killing but then again it is based during the Civil War, which made the movie very dark. The acting was, in my opinion, superb that's why I continued to watch the movie.

When watching this movie, I had the constant feeling that I was ""missing"" something, as if I had accidentally skipped the beginning and started in the middle.  I didn't get the satisfaction of have a true grip on the history of these characters, and I wanted to see more development of their relationships and to watch it unfold in more detail.

2015763,5,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain is traumatic love story of hope, loss, and dreams where Inman (Jude Law) is at war against the North and his beloved Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) is home anticipating his return.  The only news Ada receives is that more men are dying as most of the former male population of Cold Mountain is now dead.  Inman continuously reads the few letters that he has received as it keeps him hoping of getting home and holding his adored Ada in his arms.  However, he only sees blood and mud up to the knees as the meaningless war is fought and more men are being killed.  This leaves mothers mourning their children and wives turning into widows.  Despite this madness Inman is a decorated soldier who has frequently displayed his courage in battle, which often leads him into further battles as the officers trust his dedication. In a nightly skirmish Inman is wounded and sent to a hospital where he receives another letter from Ada begging him to stop marching for war and return home as she is helplessly anticipating his return. Inman decides to do as Ada requests as he hears that the South is now fighting a losing war, but he also knows that if he is captured he is considered a deserter and deserters are shot on the spot.

Cold Mountain is a powerful film displaying an intense love story between Ada and Inman where the Civil War is separating them indefinitely.  The Minghella illustrates the importance of love as it is what keeps Inman alive and dreaming of something much better than the malice of war.  However, Minghella shows the contrast to love by shooting some very graphic battles scenes that erupt in the audience's face where soldiers stab, shot, and maim each other in the name of freedom and peace.  The most intense example is where the soldiers are stepping on top of wounded men in the bottom of a mud pit where they are to face a certain death.  This demonstrates the ease of destroying life while the difficulty in maintaining life is showed throughout the film.  The film also address women's issues through the many different women in the film and how their lives are threatened as the men are killed at war.  When viewing this film it brings strong emotions against war and wishes that the women would go on similar strike as in Aristophanes's Lysistrata.  This is definitely a very political film as it offers much pondering why we are here while we are here, which in the end offers a great cinematic experience.",1089417600,,2450,4.630484988452656

2015765,1,B0001MDP36,"This is what ruined it for me: Nicole Kidman looks like she stepped out of Vogue magazine in every single scene.

Poor Rene Zellweger looks like a mac-truck ran over her, having to play opposite Nicole with her ruby-red lips and perfectly coiffed hair. Unbelievable.
I think we've become so immune to bad film-making that we'll settle for anything, especially if its packaged as a costume drama. This film contained scene after scene of purely gratuitous violence that served no purpose other than to titillate the audience. The predicaments in which Jude Law's character find himself reminded me of The Canturbury Tales - it was almost comical, it was so ridiculous. Crappy movie.",1089331200,15,919,5.052631578947368
2015766,4,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain is a sad romance about the Civil War that shows us the effects of the war on the home front and the women of the Old South.  We all expect that we know what happened to the people who lived and fought at the various fronts of the war with all its direct horrors.  There is one spectacular battle scene - The Siege of Petersburg.
Ada Monroe (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman) is a Southern Belle transplanted to rustic surroundings with her father, the Reverend Monroe (handsomely done by Donald Sutherland).  She is widely admired, but lives a lonely life.  Her special admirer is Inman (the always fine Jude Law) who is man of few words with a strong internal life that is somewhat disconnected from the world around him.
When Ada finds herself on her own she fares terribly and survives only by the kindness of her neighbors.  When the war comes and most of the men go off to the war one man that stays behind is named Teague (portrayed with real intensity by Ray Winstone).  Ada's friends send Ruby Thews (Ruby Tuesday?) to live with her because Ruby knows how to work the land and survive while Ada is an out of place jewel.
Renee Zellweger's performance as Ruby is powerful and is really the heartbeat of the movie if not the lyric poetry of it.  There is a reason Ruby is the character that lingers in the mind vividly.  Ruby and Ada thrive together and as the war turns against the south the Home Guard rises in power ostensibly to protect the people behind the lines.  Really, they prey on the citizens to advance their own greed and power.  Kathy Baker and James Gammon portray Sally and Esco Swanger who help Ada and Ruby and end up suffering terribly at the hands of the predatory protectors.
Inman wends his way home and has many adventures and the love that he and Ada share is powerful and unreasonable.  Both of them realize this and do not really understand why their slight experience together binds them so powerfully.  Ada is even unsure that Inman is alive except for some visionary hope.
Brendan Gleeson is fine as Ruby's musician father and Philip Seymour Hoffman is indelible as the Reverend Veasey.  I don't know how Mr. Hoffman consistently makes his portrayals so memorable, but he always contributes a richness to his roles that he raises the quality of everything I have seen him in.
This movie has a bleakness about it that some may find too cold, and I understand that.  However, I enjoyed the quiet depth of feeling between the characters during such amazingly hard times.  I especially enjoyed seeing the Civil War's effects on those at home who were nonetheless in the war and paid so deep a price.  To see some of that coming from those who were entrusted to protect them is all the more horrifying.",1089331200,3,2750,4.558943089430894
2015767,5,B0001MDP36,"There is probably a more closely related story in anceint Greek liturature to compare this to but I'll stick with Ulysses as being close enough (the well business in the DVD really ties it in to the old stories).
The producers did a nice job of depicting the starved, sick (tuberculosis), poorly clothed people of the war torn south except for their bright Hollywood dental work.  The period music is a lot of fun too (and I'm uncomfortable with the realization that most of it is somewhere in my CD collection in more modern versions).
Having read ""Rebel Private: Front and Rear : Memoirs of a Confederate Soldier"" by William A. Fletcher, Richard Wheeler also did a lot to help this movie come alive.  In fact I was surprised not to see a reference to the book in the closing credits of the DVD, but I didn't get to the second disc yet.",1089331200,,837,4.4640522875816995
2015768,4,B0001MDP36,"I enjoyed the movie except towards the ending.  It's like you grow to like the character while you are watching the movie, and then he is killed off which I find it hard to accept.
Inman's death seems to make all the sufferings in the movie pointless. I don't think the test of their love for each other warrants the Inman's death to make it complete.  And, the way he died, so ""worthless"", chasing a ""fugitive"" and then get killed.  Thus, it makes the movie  not satisfying.
In retrospect, this is not the movie I will watch again and again and the only lasting impression it made on me is I feel ""cheated"" by the ending.
ps: During reunion, I find Nicole Kidman and Jude Law not so ""passionate"" when they were talking, esp. when Jude Law said,""I marry you, I marry you .....""  Not sure whether his acting was too good to play an introvert or he hadn't put enough emotion into it.",1089244800,2,881,4.347560975609756

I'm not sure if I recall correctly, but Im pretty sure that in the novel, the member of Teague's party that killed Inman was depicted as a very aprehensive, young man - in the movie, however, he was depicted as the most evil man you could ever imagine... some albino guy with with pale white skin, ice-cold eyes and some limited facial hair, and having played a significant role in the torture of a woman...

There is a 90 minute chapter devoted to the words and music of the movie, that makes it worth buying alone. The intertwining of the story line among each character was very well thought out. I was never a big fan of Zelleweger but she deserved the supporting actress award, and I am now a big fan! I think that Kidman had a lot to do with that, as I thought her performance was a little weak at times, and I am a big fan of Nicole!!

No one seems to remember the ""goat lady"" and her inciteful comments (the seed, the bird, etc.).  The story centers on Inman coming home and the impact he has on events.  If he hadn't come home at that exact time, Ruby, Ada and others would have died, Ada's farm would have been taken from her, and Ada wouldn't have become pregnant with his child.  All these events could have been tragic, but by Inman coming home they were changed.

2015778,1,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain never got off the ground. Its largest problem is the failure of any of its actors to emote, however, given the fact that all of their characters are nothing but ciphers, that's to be expected.
We never find out anything about their characters and as a result it's almost impossible to identify with any of them. The Renee character is so much of a country stereotype that we almost expect a banjo riff whenever she appears onscreen. The script also lacks three acts, as the movie is just a collection of short events.
None of these events are particularly exciting, and when coupled with the other writing problems, you end up with a film that has you checking your watch over and over again.
Now on to some good things: it's shot well. The photography is ok, but that's unfortunately all the positive things this film has going for it. There are far better romantic movies out there for you to see.",1088985600,6,913,4.573170731707317
2015779,3,B0001MDP36,"Many people seem to like this movie, and I am almost one of them. But there are things wrong with it that surface after as it digests, like a tasty meal tainted with ptomaine. A careful viewer may catch the signs of it as the film progresses, things that an optimistic moviegoer will just push aside to be swept up in the story. In the end these faults turn a respectable effort into a pile of cliches.
For its benefit, Nicole Kidman turns in a fine performance. She makes you wish the story was better. Renee Zellweger has gotten raves for her character, but I kept being reminded of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm all grown up. I like her and Jude Law but I wouldn't recommend this film in regard to them. Jude gets plenty of screentime but his character is so restrained, you hardly get to know him. And that brings me to the foul, tainted meat of this grandscale meal.
Cold Mountain is visciously anti-male. It makes a point of how stupid men are that they go to war and then conveniently side-steps the slavery issue or as the South saw it, a fight for independence. So is it saying that enslavement is better than fighting for freedom? In this way it actually reduces the women characters as incapable of seeing the Big Picture beyond home and hearth. The scene with Natalie Portman at first seems a refreshing avoidance of the politically correct ""Yankees/good guys, Rebs/bad guys"" of the last few decades, but when placed in the entire context of the movie becomes more of its latent theme: Men are Stupid, Bad, and Only Needed for Continuing the Species. So killing Yankees, since they are men, is no big deal. The tiresome and overworked Hollywood plot device of ""man sleep with woman, then he die"" (As I noted with ""The Missing"") is embraced at the end to my total disappointment because it was so obvious it was going to happen. When Jude and Nicole decide to ""marry"", I knew it was his last cigarette before the firing squad. All the hell and high water he'd gone through and any hope for an original ending was for nothing.
It would be interesting to watch the film over just for the body count, because it seems virtually ALL the men die! Just think about it and add up the bodies. By the end, it seems the only men left in the county are Renee's father and husband. And consider them: the father has bowed to his daughter's expectations of him, and the husband is docile to his wife. In the final scene he is even serving her at the table. As a last dig at the futility of masculinity, both the offsprings of Nicole and Renee favor the mother's appearance.
Certainly, Cold Mountain is a beautiful film to watch. But the ideas within its plot are disturbing. It is at its worst when the women, such as Renee, rant against the stupidity of men and war, as if the women, simply because they don't participate in any bayonet charges, are guiltless. Look into the history of the Civil War and you'll find the upper-class women urged their men to fight to protect their lavish antebellum lifestyle. It is at its best in brief scenes  such as the goat woman interlude. That was poignant and extraordinary. So I don't discount the movie entirely, but its inherent theme against men distracts me so much, I probably won't watch it again.",1088985600,6,3240,4.510204081632653
2015780,4,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" is exquisite, as defined as `of delicate artistry and composition"" or as ""of extreme beauty'. Its roots go back to the sweeping epics of long ago, such as ""Dr. Zhivago"" and ""Gone With the Wind"". Moviegoers addicted to fast food and instant gratification may find it slow and even tedious. More patient viewers, however, should be enthralled. In the end, ""Cold Mountain"" does not quite achieve the artistic heights its makers were aiming for, but its many moments of great beauty and emotion make it a worthwhile effort. It is one of 2003's best releases.
Unlike its epic predecessors, ""Cold Mountain"" does not take place in a great capitol like Atlanta or Moscow. It centers in a very small town in a sparsely populated region of North Carolina. It is a `forgotten' part of the American Civil War. Its protagonists, Ada Monroe [Nicole Kidman] and Inman [Jude Law], do not know each other well. Ada has recently moved to Cold Mountain from Charleston, SC with her preacher father. It may be love at first sight, but Ada and Inman barely have time to get to know each other before the war separates them. Inman goes off to fight, and, when Ada's father unexpectedly dies, she is left to tend their farm, a task which her classical education upbringing leaves her ill prepared for. A kind and knowing neighbor sends her a backwoods girl [Renee Zelllweger] to help out. As the war years drag on, Ada and Inman, caught up in worlds they do not understand, cling to each other as symbols of hope. Hardly knowing each other, each must fantasize about the other. Theirs is a love of the first magnitude.
The cast is brilliant, but Zellweger steals the show. It could be because she is the only major cast member who is actually from the American South. [But, then, Vivian Leigh was from England, and she stole the show in ""Gone With the Wind"".] I think it more likely that Ms. Zellweger is an extraordinary actress who can outdo other extraordinary actors like Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law.",1088899200,,1992,4.678062678062678
2015781,5,B0001MDP36,"Inman's odyssey, his epic journey to return to his love waiting for him on Cold Mountain, forms the backbone of this story. Inman, played by Jude Law with admirable silence and restraint, is on a trek of the highest magnitude, walking across mountain after mountain, hiding from and sometimes fighting off the murderous Home Guard, and hiding from and sometimes fighting off equally miserable Union soldiers.
Ada (Nicole Kidman), Inman's love, is the daughter of a Charleston preacher who moved to Cold Mt ""for his health and on his doctor's advice,"" right before the war began. He dies, leaving Adam raised to be a lady with no practical skills whatsoever, to fend for herself as the South loses and loses and loses. The farm is on the brink of being reclaimed by the surrounding woods when onto the property walks Ruby, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger. She lacks all the social graces that Ada possesses, but she's got what, today, we'd call ""street cred"": the girl knows how to slaughter a chicken, build a fence, till a field, whatever.
The movie flips back and forth between Inman's Odyssean journey (during which he meets every kind of person, place, animal, and thing) toward home and Ada and Ruby's attempts to try to insure that there's such a thing as home for him to return to.
It's the stuff of a good old-fashioned romantic epic.",1088899200,2,1333,4.8

1) Anthony Minghella has created another romantic epic like (but not as good as) ""The English Patient"".
2) Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are fine, and Renee Zellweger is flat-out amazing. Compare ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" to ""Chicago"" to this and her range is clearly impressive.
3) The music is haunting and the cinematography lush.
4) The battle scenes have a 'Saving Private Ryan"" immediacy to them, notably the opening one.

2015783,1,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain left me shivering.  I had spent two hours and five minutes in front of the T. V., the last 30 min. or so praying that the house would catch ablazes and give me cause to stop watching this hypnotically tedious trap of a motion picture.  I don't remember much of the last 40 minutes or so, but I do know that at about the 1 hour 55 min. mark I started wondering how long this picture was.
If you get this film for the Civil War components, don't bother.  This should have burned with Atlanta.
If you watch this for the romantic aspects, well Chances Are would win raving awards before this slow train.
If you're simply bored, jump off a roof with a blanket.  It could be much more fun and less embarassing to admit to than watching Cold Mountain.

2015787,2,B0001MDP36,"In ""Cold Mountain,"" director Anthony Minghella wants us to believe in the love between Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) but has nothing to prove it. For the most part of the movie they are kept distant and communicating only through letters, mostly from Ada, as she voiceovers her sappy messages that suggests that she has read her poetry but has yet to master its significance and proper usage. Their relationship begins awkwardly and unconvincingly, sharing no insight into the background of both Inman and Ada, and we do not understand nor are we hinted at about their desire for one another. Except for one piece of excerpt that seems to be written because it has not been written before, as Inman prepares to leave for the Civil War and suggests Ada to leave Cold Mountain and she something in the vicinity of, ""Then there won't be anyone waiting for you.""
Kidman and Law are less than adequate in this film. Law, who got an underserved Academy nomination, contains little emotion and energy and misplaced. Kidman plays Ada a little more passionately but even she seems more like a mere imitation. Both Law and Kidman seem more affixed with getting their southern accent done properly, and not even that do they triumph at. Rene Zellwegger, who won the Oscar for Ruby, is actually the only flare to this film. She is funny, loud, and crude and certainly a good addition to balance out the blandness of Kidman and Law. Yet, her Oscar is underserved because Ruby is too one-dimensional and seems more like a caricature trying to jumpstart a boring party.
In the commercial for ""Cold Mountain,"" one critic said it's the ""best Civil War movie of all times."" I can refute it in so many ways but the main argument is that the Cold War is a minor detail in this movie. Throughout the film, Minghella only suggests the importance of the love between these two protagonists and offers no statement about the war. Once in a while the war is being questioned but there are many things that are not attentively mentioned such as issues of slavery. ""Cold Mountain"" is fashionably dressed by Minghella's artistry, which I admire, but the lack of sentimentality makes this a disappointing Civil War film.",1088812800,3,2202,4.751958224543081
2015788,4,B0001MDP36,"It was an unbearably hot day in the Pacific Northwest (89 degrees), too hot to be outside, but a perfect day for watching a movie, and what better movie to watch than Cold Mountain with its sweeping snow scenes.  And, by the way, it is a pretty good flick at that.
Set near the end of the Civil War, the movie captures the human drama and the enormous lost that the south experienced as a result of that war. They were simply devastated- a whole generation of men killed, woman who had to live the rest of their lives as widows or unmarried, the economic depravation and the horrendous lost of lives as demonstrated by the bodies of the war dead stacked up like cord wood.  It was sobering to watch.  Yet, through this tale of war, separation and death, comes a message of hope.  It demonstrates the triumph of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming obstacles.
The casting was superb.  Jude Law- what can one say, but that he is an exceptional actor.  No, he is not a superhero with six-pack abs and a steroid induced body, but an ordinary guy, caught up in extraordinary circumstances, who by sheer determination and luck manages to survive where others die.  What can I say about the ending?  Having not read the book, I do not know the original story line, but I was just a little disappointed.  I just saw it coming.

I will keep this short, because the movie doesn't deserve much after it's horrid ending, which totally destroys the entire story.

2015792,5,B0001MDP36,"This 2-disc presentation of director Anthony Minghella's COLD MOUNTAIN is very impressive. COLD MOUNTAIN is an interesting and somewhat engrossing low-key story of the Southern home front and one man's fight to return from the battlefield in this romantic Civil War tale. The story ranges from romantic imagery to a sense of mysticism in its telling. The initial focus is set in the Confederate fortifications around Petersburg. This Civil War action here is brief but impresses the viewer with its imagery depicting the Battle of Petersburg, better known as the ""battle of the crater,"" in 1864. The film then focuses on the climatic convergence of its central characters. This is a film that truly relies on its juxtaposition of panoramic and intimate images to convey the emotion of its story. Jude Law's stoic and purely visual performance is very effective to the success of this fairytale-like and highly impressionistic film. The detailed ""Climbing Cold Mountain"" documentary that is approximately 70 minutes in length and ""A Journey to Cold Mountain"" which is an interesting making-of featurette make this DVD a must-have for admirers of this film. Also, the ""Scared Harp History"" documentary, which explores the musical influences and origins used in the film is quite fascinating and shows the integral part that music plays in historical films of this kind.

Jude Law was very good in his part as was Renee Zellwigger (sp.).  Unfortunately, these two could not carry the movie.

The cinematography is also great, as are the other actors. I especially liked Natalie Portman's small role. There are some things that could have been done better. It seems so strange the two main characters would miss each other so much after such a short time together. It didn't seem believeable.

2015796,5,B0001MDP36,"I thought Cold Mountain was the best film of 2003.  Anthony Minghella fashioned an extremely moving, visually lovely, and richly literate adaptation of Charles Frazier's novel.  At the center is an unusual love story -- of two people who barely know each other, and yet who, with the memories of a few magical moments, invent a profound love between them in order to survive in the war-torn world around them.
Jude Law gives a beautiful and subtly expressive performance as Inman, the taciturn and deeply inward central character.  Nicole Kidman is superb as Ada as is Renee Zelwegger in her Oscar-winning performance as Ruby.  The relationship between Ada and Ruby becomes one of the movie's most moving elements.  The massive supporting cast is filled with some of the best character actors in the industry.
Despite its old-fashioned epic richness, Cold Mountain is also filled with moments of extreme violence, which are shockingly and wrenchingly staged by Minghella.  In addition, it's also a deeply musical film, with a haunting score by Gabriel Yared and  numerous gorgeous songs from the old south.  It's a shame that most critics condescended to this film, and chose to review it in the context of Miramax's (admittedly distasteful and relentless) Oscar campaigning.  It is not strikingly original or free from the occasional Hollywood cliche.  But it is lovingly made, beautifully crafted, and carefully paced.  That's more than can be said for most films - Hollywood or independent - these days.
The 5 stars are for the film.  The DVD transfer is - to my unprofessional eyes - crap.  I'm astonished that Miramax would release such a visually stunning movie in such a grainy, unfocused, unvibrant transfer.  It's a shame, and Miramax should be embarrassed.",1088294400,3,1766,5.086805555555555
2015797,5,B0001MDP36,"Adapted from Charles Frazier's book of the same name, Cold Mountain (2003) is an epic odyssey of one man's struggle to travel back home to the woman he loves set against the backdrop of the American Civil War. Unfairly snubbed at last year's Academy Awards, it is a moving film that has been given the royal treatment on DVD.
The first DVD features an audio commentary with writer-director Anthony Minghella and editor Walter Murch. He goes into great detail about the themes of the movie while Murch, not surprisingly, talks about how it was assembled through editing. Both men are very eloquent speakers and provide a fascinating look at how to make an epic period drama.
The second DVD begins with an exhaustive 70-minute documentary entitled, ""Climbing Cold Mountain."" It starts off with the transition from novel to screenplay and then pretty much every aspect, from location scouting to casting, is examined in detail. There are excellent interviews with the principal actors (Law, Kidman, Zellweger) who talk about their experiences working on the movie.
There are 11 deleted scenes that are redundant for the most part and it is obvious to see why there were cut.
""The Words and Music of Cold Mountain"" is a classy, 90-minute concert featuring many of the musicians who contributed to the movie's soundtrack, including Jack White, Sting and Alison Krauss. Interspersed amongst the musical performances are readings from Charles Frazier's book by actors Brendan Gleeson, Nicole Kidman and Jude Law. This is an impressive extra that fans of the movie will really enjoy.
""A Journey to Cold Mountain"" is a 30-minute Making Of featurette that is more along the lines of press kit material. It feels a bit redundant after watching the 70-minute documentary and the 90-minute concert.
Musician Tim Eriksen talks about the ""Sacred Harp History"" which is a book of songs and the specific way they were song back in the day.
Finally, there is a ""Storyboard Comparison"" which looks at three scenes from the movie and how they match up with the storyboards.
Cold Mountain shows how the Civil War touched everyone. It made women into widows and turned brother against brother. It left thousands dead or maimed and left the United States devastated for a long time afterwards. Minghella's film is balanced in that it shows inhuman acts perpetrated on both sides and how two people find each other amidst all of this chaos and madness.

Jude Law is the perfect choice to play Inman, his quiet intensity truly conveys the horror of war, and the effects on soldiers. Nicole Kidman was a surprising choice as Ada, but does a marvelous job.

There is one other thing that recommends this film, and that is its splendid cinematography.  Otherwise, the plotting feels very similar to another of Director Anthony Minghella's films, ""The English Patient,"" only this story is set during the Civil War.  Also, there are some obvious plot devices that had me shaking my head.  One I remember is when Jude Law and Philip Seymor Hoffman are making their way through the wilderness when they just happen across a large, two-handled saw.  Hmmmmm, I wonder if this item will come into play in a future scene?  I didn't have to wait very long.  There is also an over-abundance of nudity.  Being a guy, this is a rare thing for me to complain about, but it just feels gratuitous here;  like it's used more for shock-value than for any specific reason.

That might be because the characters themselves both mention how few words have passed between them.  We have no trouble believing in the ""love""  of other movie couples who have one scene and jump into bed,  why shouldn't we believe Ada and Inman?  People have clung to less to get them through trials.  Anyway,  this movie had so much more to say-about the friendship between women,  the relationships of fathers and daughters,  the kindness of strangers.

2015806,4,B0001MDP36,"Christmas came early last year when I got the chance to review a new film called Cold Mountain for my article in the magazine I write for. I expected a tedious and dowdy journey of the heroic soldier travelling back from the War to his sweetheart that I have reviewed so many times before, but I was in for a supprise. With an all star cast and Jude Law and Nicole Kidman leading the way, I belived my pre-written review of a ""fidget in your seats"" film would need to be re-written. Jude and Nicole gave heart-warming proformances as the lost lovers and the on-screen chemistry worked well with the story line. (I also write a gossip column in the magazine and could quite happily once again go on about the denyed ""affair"" between them, but....maybe not!) However, I feel Renee Zelweger with her informous Ruby steals the limelight away from the others. She clearly shows the hard surface of Ruby's character in the beginning, but Renee has the power to release the softer Ruby steadily thoughout the remainder of the story, especially with the events concerning her Father. The Oscar sitting on her matlepiece at home is clearly deserved. The dodgy Yank accent is the only let down of this masterpiece, and as my readers know, I never give full marks on my review as there is always room for improvement, but I have to admit, this is the closest I have ever got to giving away full marks!",1086480000,8,1390,4.564
2015807,5,B0001MDP36,COLD MOUNTAIN is a simple story that delivers a powerful message about love. It is both beautiful yet brutal in its story of romantic love. Jude Law was perfect as the Confederate soldier returning to his loved one.,1086134400,,215,4.684210526315789
2015808,4,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" is a proof that good story and photography can be very fascinating so as to make us forget the obvious flaws of the entire film.  The film is trying to be romantic, but the central characters are emotionally detached; it is breathtakingly beautiful (kudos to John Seale, ""English Patient""), but way too long; and, hey, Renee Zellweger mightbe Texas-born, but is Jude Law an American?  Or Nicole Kidman?
Actually, Nicole was born in Hawaii, but surely looks gorgeous as the priest's daughter Ada Monroe, who moved to Cold Mountain in 1864.  She meets a local boy Inman (Law), and before he leaves the village to join the Civil War, she exchanges a brief kiss with him, which changes the lives of the two.  He vows to come back no matter what it takes, and we see Inman leaving the battlefield without permission, and going back to the home hunted by the army, and also Ada, who waits for him to come back, enduring the unhappy incidents back in the village, being helped by a wild and independent girl Ruby (Zellweger).
What ever you see in ""Cold Mountain,"" you have seen in the previously made American history dramas -- especially ""Gone with the Wind.""  And as to Law and Kidman, yes, they are handsome, to be sure, but cannot spark the fire that should thaw the snow falling on this mountain.  The problem is not acting -- it is excellent -- but the too long middle section, in which so many episodes are inserted with supporting actors.
Support comes from everywhere.  See how Inman meet Eileen Atkins, Giovanni Ribisi, Philip Seymore Hoffman, and Natalie Portman on the way home as if the film insists on using the names of these talents.  However, I don't know the casting can be all justified (I think Portman is miscast), and if you blink (yes, literally), you will miss Jena Malone.
You also get ubiquitous Donald Sutherland, Ray Winstone, Brendan Bleeson, Charlie Hunnam, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Jack White (his debut as actor), Lucas Black, and so on and on.  The clout of director Anthony Minghella?  Possibly.  But I believe there is a better way to prove that.
""Cold Mountain"" gracefully exudes the bitter-sweet smell of romance, and also never fails to present the painful memories of the war.  It is always great to watch, and never stops the story.  But as a whole it should have been tighter, or at least concentrated the relations between the man and woman though it still deserves watching for those who love romantic stories.",1085702400,,2464,4.728971962616822
2015809,1,B0001MDP36,"Having not read the book upon which this film is based, I cannot comment on how closely the script followed the source material.  What I can say is that if the book was much like the movie, I'm glad I didn't read it.
The cast is studded with fine actors, especially Jude Law, a personal favorite of mine.  However, ""Cold Mountain"" doesn't bring out the best in any of them.  Law's accent falters quite a bit, and his character is emotionally flat.  In all fairness, this is largely the script's fault, but that doesn't make it enjoyable.  Nicole Kidman's performance is passable in the first half, but quickly devolves into extreme over-acting.  Renee Zellweger's incredibly stereotypical character is over-drawn in both script and performance from her introduction.
The real problem though is the script.  This movie has been made hundreds of times- usually better.  The couple has a brief, shallow, and virtually passionless relationship before they are separated for years, and yet they supposedly fall madly in love with one another.  Inman (Law) makes an unbelievable journey populated by stock characters and predictable adventures.  The way events unfolded for him as he travels from point A to B to C, always resulting in some kind of struggle, put me more in mind of a frustrating ten-year-old video game than a masterpiece of dramatic cinema.
Characters in the film are all clearly and unequivocably divided into ""good"" and ""bad"" camps.  While the ""good"" characters aren't very original, the ""bad"" ones are archetypes of comic book supervillains.  They are so supremely evil they make Hitler look like Lassie.  The ""Home Guard"" insanely decides to brutally slaughter anyone they can on the thinnest of pretexts.  This is ridiculous and unrealistic.  After all, everything they believed in was embodied by this small, southern hometown they were trying to protect, yet they went out of their way to destroy it.  A simple sense of self-preservation against the invading Union Army would have been enough of a reason to stay their hands.  The Union soldiers, briefly though they appear, aren't much better.  They attempt to steal food, commit rape, and all but murder an infant on a whim.  Of course these things occurred during the war, but such encounters are so common in war films that they seem hackneyed.
The final mark against ""Cold Mountain"" is its incredibly long running time.  If a movie is good, I want it to be long.  But this one was so redundant and overbearing that I couldn't wait for it to end.  Inman basically has too many encounters, each one at its core the same as the last.
This movie has been widely praised by critics and many fans.  Perhaps it is because the book was so well-received and lavished with awards.  If so, that must be clouding the critics' judgment on this awful film.",1084147200,9,2816,4.88
2015810,5,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" was a romantic movie that showed me a good time. In contrast to most shallow movies in the theaters these days, the novel-adapted movie was moving and rich in meaning. Moreover, the picturesque scenes reminded me of the classic romance ""Gone with the Wind"" as both of them are about the Civil War and how people deal with it. Of course, it is impossible to be as good as GWTW, but a finely-made movie during these years.
War's ugliness and brutality was vividly portrayed in the movie. The screenplay starts with Inman, the male protagonist, painstakingly fighting in the war. The civil war undermined his nascent relationship with Ada. The war went on, regardless of the injured and dying soldier, not to mention their wretched families. On the other hand, people of the same union did not always cooperate with each other but cast greedy eyes on their comrades' possessions. Violence made people display the most sinister side of their personality, so I was glad that there is no war around me, or people would have to bear the sufferings depicted in the film.
The hesitancy people in old times had when expressing their feelings was beauteous. Ada, the female protagonist, and Inman loved each other with equal passion, yet neither knew the proper way to let it out. The implication held a fascinating beauty to me, for people in modern times do not bother to conceal their feelings.
Brilliant music was composed along with the film. In the movie, the music is peaceful and sweet when the shot moves to Cold Mountain. The songs are particularly beautiful in romantic moments as they served to accentuate the elegance of love. On the other hand, they are also enjoyable to listen to out of the movie. When the two theme songs, You Will Always Be My Ain Love"" and ""Scarlet Tide"" were performed live at the Academy Awards this year, I was stunned by the magnificent melodies.
In sum, ""Cold Mountain"" is sorrowfully beautiful. It makes me reflect on my own life as well as appreciating the fantastic scenery shown.

No, film, even Gone with the Wind, has ever portrayed the Civil War in this way.  The acting was absolutely superb.  Jude, Nicole, and especially Renee, had flawless Southern accents.  Anthony Minghella did a superb job at directing.  He took an awesome book, and transformed it into an awesome movie.  I honestly wished the film could've been even longer.  The story moves you in such a great way.  Other highlights of the film is it's killer supporting cast, which includes Brendan Gleeson, Natalie Portman, and Phillip Seymore Hoffman, along with beautiful music, and the beautiful cinematography.  Even with almost identical parallels with Gone with the Wind and Titanic, the film is actually more of a Casablanca of our time. Go see this film, or rent the DVD.",1081296000,,934,5.119205298013245
2015812,4,B0001MDP36,"COLD MOUNTAIN is a well-paced story of the Southern home front and one man's fight to return from the battlefield in this romantic Civil War tale. The story ranges from romantic imagery to a sense of mysticism in its telling.  The initial focus is set in a brief but impress Battle of Petersburg, better known as the ""battle of the crater,"" in 1864. The film then focuses on the climatic convergence of its central characters. This is a film that truly relies on its juxtaposition of panoramic and intimate images to convey the emotion of its story.",1080691200,,549,4.65979381443299
2015813,4,B0001MDP36,"It's really difficult to review this film -- critics and reviewers have been almost unanimous in praising the well-crafted, old-fashioned filmmaking but pointed out the movie somehow fell apart due to its episodic structure, which made it messy and scattered. These claims are basically justified, but ""Cold Mountain"" still has so many good things in it that it would be unwise not to recommend it.
As far as filmmaking is concerned, ""Cold Mountain"" has indeed not left much to be desired. Cinematography, acting performances, script teeming with touching moments, editing and music are top-notch. The music was produced by T-Bone Burnett (with credits for Jack White, Sting and Alison Krauss, among others), who was behind the phenomenal success of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" soundtrack. ""Cold Mountain"" at times even formally reminds us of 'Brother' -- an escape odyssey through the American South.
As for the story, love at first sight thriving despite the horrible Civil War damaging the South is truly a viewer-luring and award-enticing concept and so it proved to be already with ""Gone With The Wind"". This time however, the romance rings true and promises to equal those great movie love stories only in the initial part of the film  -- by the time Inman (Jude Law) kisses Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) goodbye in a pre-war rush, the love is full-blown.
Kidman is probably miscast as inexperienced town girl Ada, well-educated but thoroughly unprepared for living on a country farm on her own. Helped out she is by a no-nonsense country girl Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger in a dynamic, Oscar-winning performance, sporting great southern accent). Jude Law again confirms himself as one of the leading and most talented actors of his generation.
The bulk of the film we see him coming home, weary and wounded, from the battlefield, risking his life as a deserted soldier. During its course, the film's many episodes, often very cruel and violent, depict the ultimate futility of war, which somehow takes emphasis off the romance. One might be inclined to agree it was done on purpose -- the war usually destroys the human relations -- but the reunion and bitter-sweet ending indicate that the director Anthony Minghella really aimed to keep romance up in front. It's not that Law and Kidman do not fit together well. Maybe the war really changed their characters so much...
The movie's chief idea is that life is always worth living despite all odds you meet on the way. Condemning the war similarly as the profound ""English Patient"", the hope and consolation, nevertheless, get an upper hand in the ""Cold Mountain"". Had the romance been as involving as that in ""The English Patient"" (although you could be repulsed by adulterous relationship there), the movie could match its predecessor's nine Oscars.",1079481600,,2806,5.060475161987041

What's wrong with the film:
1) Too many epsisodes of over stereotyped evil characters doing hideous things to others - approaches banality.
2) Significant and compelling dialogue missing.
3) Nicole Kidman couldn't find her character.  Was she a shy youth or the refined daughter of an erudite pastor?  Whatever it was she did to try and combine these elements didn't work.
What's right with the file:
1) Renee Zellweger's performance of a country bumpkin was outstanding, probably making the film worth seeing because of it alone.
2) Timeless story line of love searching for fulfillment.
Summary: Too many blood and guts scenes for a chick flick, but didn't rise above that genre's level of serious commentary besides lacking its fun and humor.",1079136000,3,936,4.942675159235669
2015815,4,B0001MDP36,"For me, this film would have had much greater dramatic impact had director Anthony Minghella not attempted to cover too much, or if that coverage had been in sharper focus and more cohesive. Adapted by him from Charles Frazier's novel Cold Mountain, his film examines

* a Civil War South variation on Odysseus's return to Ithaca

* an implausible romance between Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law)

* the horrors of war which largely explain Inman's desertion (for many of the same reasons why John Dunbar flees from ""civilization"" in Dances with Wolves)

* an estranged, indeed dysfunctional relationship between Ruby (Renee Zellweger) and her father Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson)

* the abusive and oppressive, at times vicious Home Guard in the Cold Mountain (NC) area under the absolute control of Teague (Ray Winstone)

* Ada's severely difficult adjustment to the Civil War's impact on her and her father, as well as her struggles to keep her farm

Of course, there are also several related story lines (sub plots, actually) but these six receive most of Zinghella's attention. As indicated earlier, I think he attempts to cover too much within the parameters of a commercial film, even one with a running time of 155 minutes which this one has.

Ada and Inman spend almost no time together before he departs for the war. They are indeed an odd couple: she is a reticent, cultured, proper beauty (the archetypical Southern Belle) and he is also reticent, almost to the point of being mute but lacks her culture and refinement. As I observed their brief and awkward interaction in the film, there seemed to be almost no chemistry between them, perhaps because there was little chemistry between Kidman and Law. My hunch (only a hunch) is that Inman's revulsion to the horrors of war rather than his attraction to Ada explains his obsession to return ""home."" That is, what he flees is a much greater motivation than is what (who) awaits him. One man's opinion.

All that said, I think Zellweger deserved her Academy Award for best actress in a supporting role. I also think the cinematography (John Seale) and musical score (Gabriel Yared) are especially effective. The opening sequence which includes a defining moment, indeed an epiphany for Inman, is masterfully presented. It invites comparisons with the final sequence in Glory. Cold Mountain has memorable moments and some excellent performances. For reasons indicated, however, I think the film falls short of greatness for many of the same reasons that other recent films have. (Gangs of New York, for example.) More often than not, less really can be more.",1079049600,,2636,4.9863325740318905

This movie touched my heart, reminded me of new love, and made me appreciate even more that my husband came home safe.  I can't wait for the DVD.",1078272000,14,417,3.9166666666666665
2015817,3,B0001MDP36,"This story of one man's walk from Virginia to North Carolina in his attempt to return to the love that motivates him has - unsurprisingly - a somewhat rambling form. Somehow I think the rambling and episodic structure was probably better suited to a novel than to a mainstream Hollywood film.
In part ""Cold Mountain"" is based on Homer's Odyssey, with Jude Law as the Ulysses-like Inman, and Nicole Kidman's Ada Monroe as the Penelope who waits for him despite the attention of at least one highly unsuitable suitor.
The film's set before and during the American Civil War, and begins with a devastating battle in Petersburg, Virginia. Troops from the Northern Army mine the Southern front line. The resulting explosions demolish it to great effect, but all doesn't go according to plan, as the advancing Northern soldiers are caught in the crater made by their own explosions ... and mown down. That scene is writer / director Anthony Minghella's version of ""Saving Private Ryan's"" opening scene, and very much shows us that the movie isn't going to be about the glories of war.
""Cold Mountain"" gets off to an excellent start, inter-cutting gritty battle scenes with Inman's memories of Ada, the woman he loves, and with whom he's shared little more than one hurried kiss. Ada is the daughter of Reverend Monroe, played by Donald Sutherland, and has received a fairly good education in Charleston. That means she hasn't learned how to do much of anything practical.
Inman, after suffering a bad neck wound, decides he is going to return to Ada whatever the cost, deserts the army, and begins his long trek back to North Carolina and Cold Mountain. Ada meanwhile is having to cope with the death of her father, the difficulty of surviving as a single woman, and the attentions of lecherous bad guy and home guardsman Teague, played by Ray Winstone. Her neighbours, including Sally Swanger (the excellent Kathy Baker) try to help her, but it becomes pretty clear she's not going to make it through the next winter without help, and that help turns up in the shape of the extremely practical and down to earth backwoods girl Ruby Thewes (Rene Zellwegger)
Although the film starts superbly, it gradually becomes disappointing. The grittiness of the beginning gives way to ever more Hollywood glamour as the movie goes on, particularly in the story of Kidman's Ada. Kidman gets prettier and prettier as times get harder and harder. Zellwegger comes on like Doris Day in ""Annie Get Your Gun"" or something out of ""Oklahoma"", and adds scrunched up funny faces to the mix. And the bad guys back at home turn into cardboard villains that might almost come from a spaghetti western, particularly the almost albino Bosie (Charlie Hunnam). And why are albinos always evil in movies?
Inman's story fares somewhat better. During his trek he encounters a variety of picaresque characters. There's a preacher (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is initially about to murder his pregnant black mistress when Inman stops him. Jena Malone plays a girl who operates a ferry boat that will allow them to escape their pursuers, if they pay her enough. Giovanni Ribisi is hillbilly Junior, who in another nod to the Odyssey, lives with a bevy of sex-starved siren-like women. Natalie Portman is Sara, a single mother who Inman sleeps beside and then has to rescue from the attention of marauding Southern soldiers. And there's a strange gipsy woman who - particularly given that much of the movie was shot in Romania - seems rather like a refugee from one of the old universal werewolf movies.
John Seale's cinematography captures the din of war, the stunning scenery of Romania, and the quieter interiors, well. And, visually the film is helped much by the production design of Dante Ferretti, although I wonder if sometimes that too isn't a little too pretty. There's some good music, although the best of it is performed within the film, old American hymns, and folk music such as ""Wayfaring Stranger"". There's even a song composed by Sting and sung by Alison Krauss, which works better than one might expect it to. Gabriel Yared's more thematic soundtrack music seems rather less memorable.
Ultimately, ""Cold Mountain"" is marred by several weaknesses, one of the worst is that in its conclusion it's something of a shaggy dog story. It also suffers, like some of Minghella's other films, from a strange emotional coldness: neither Jude Law nor Nicole Kidman touches us as much as they should. Often the emotions surrounding the cameo characters are far more intense, particularly those played by Nathalie Portman and Kathie Baker.
But this is nothing new for Minghella. In both ""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" you wanted to feel somewhat more emotional about the characters than you actually did. In his first film ""Truly, Madly Deeply"" director Anthony Minghella struck a wonderfully poignant emotional note. With the move to Hollywood his films to have become much more focussed on about surfaces or spectacle, and that's a pity.
Like ""Legends of the Fall"" Cold Mountain"" is ultimately an attempt to transform a sweeping and often gritty historical novel into a movie that's just far more glamorous than it should be for its own good.  It's an interesting movie, but not a wholly successful one.",1078012800,7,5300,4.941704035874439
2015818,4,B0001MDP36,"This movie made me very emotional, and whenever a movie does that, I know it's done its job.  It was toted as war movie for the guys, a romance for the girls, but really it was neither.  Really, it was a movie about loss and faith and how horrible humans can become in the midst of war.  Certainly at this time this movie is more relevant than ever.  I cried at least three times during this movie, and a little more afterward.  It is honestly one of the most depressing things I have ever seen, but I still hold onto it and feel it was necessary to see.
One of the things I liked about its focus.  It didn't focus on slavery and it didn't focus of relatives who went to different sides during the war.  In fact, we barely met a Union soldier, and when we did, they seemed no different from the confederate.  Neither side was lionized becuase in many ways, they were both very much the same.  The focus of the movie was on the struggle for survival in a period where killing is condoned and death is everywhere and how it can corrupt people.  It was very much like The Iliad in this respect, only not so much on the battlefield.
My problems with the film (in other words, why it didn't get a five) were a) the fact that neither Ada or Ruby both looked like they were all geared up for the red carpet make up wise through out the entire film and b) Jude Law's character needs some more development!  This movie will stick with me because it  had a powerful message and wasn't afraid to show it.",1077926400,,1493,4.2
2015819,3,B0001MDP36,"The same crew that brought us ""The English Patient"" brings us ""Cold Mountain,"" for better or worse.  There is a similar gauzy look and air of unreality about the film.  That doesn't diminish some fine acting, especially from Renee Zellweger.
You've probably already heard that she steals the film, but that's not quite so.  There are fine supporting performances, notably from Donald Sutherland, as Kidman's soon-to-expire dad.

The film is faithful to the plot of the book, except in the portrayal of Inman (Jude Law) who is mature, competent, and enigmatic in print but a bumbling, callow youth on-screen.  Still, except for the director and producers seeing a need to beat everyone to death with ""war is bad, war is bad"" rather than leave Charles Frazier's accurate history intact, the plot is gripping.

On the whole, a good, albeit not great film.  See it, but no need to rush to do so.",1077840000,4,891,4.822368421052632
2015820,3,B0001MDP36,"Both Rene Zellweger and Jude Law give outstanding performances in this movie. However, I felt Nicole Kidman was just awful. The movie takes place during the civil war, and Nicole looks like she just walked out of a spa in Beverly Hills. I also felt Natalie Portman was mis-cast in her role.

I agree with the other reviews I read that people say the nudity was excessive and unnecessary. The director could have shown the love scene with a much lighter hand, and the point would have come across alot better. It wasn't as romantic as it should have been, the nudity was to obvious.

Regardless, Renee is wonderful, and is definately worthy of her Oscar nomnation. Even being in a film that was not that well done, she gives a performance 100% better than anyone else in the cast.  Jude Law is also outstanding, as a man who is running away from the Civil War.
Also, this is a movie about the American Civil War. The studio shot in in a foreign country just to save money .... very tacky.",1077753600,,987,4.441988950276243
2015821,4,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" was a pretty good flick -- it may go without saying that the book was better -- but I felt it was tainted by a conscious eye on the academy awards.
There's the stab at a supporting actress bid in the propped-up comic role for Renee Zellweger. Best actress (which it didn't get, ironically) attempt with the woman-without-her-man-fends-for-herself Nicole Kidman, who comically dons the latest New York fashions at the end of the movie as if showing us that's what happens to women if they're not properly domesticated, they become big-city professionals. Best actor in Jude Law - the most compelling performance, by the way - who walks through literal hells, all for the love of a woman.
But the best example of an Oscar attempt was the Kiss. Kidman searches out Law on the day of his departure, and they lock lips in one of the steamiest kisses you'll ever see on the big screen. Don't go looking for it in the book, however. It didn't happen. In the book, Ada and Inman are too bound by convention, by time and place, which makes their respective personal rebellions later against the war and in favor of a simple personal connection all the more remarkable. In the movie, however, libido is heightened, and a memorable kiss occurs that doesn't jibe with the original story, but makes great cinema. After ""Cold Mountain"" wins best pic, they'll show this kiss in every awards ceremony afterwards. Put money on it.
Lately I've been thinking about the irony that this movie and ""Master and Commander"" got academy nods. They're both war movies in time of war. Unlike the cheesy and straight-forward propagandistic flicks of the Second World War which told us how to feel about the war, these movies are subtler and simply reflect our attitudes to war. War is hell, they say, good people die. But...it's dang glamorous, baby! And boy! Do we enjoy it!
Perhaps a natural attitude for a people who are just about completely unaffected by the war our country is currently embroiled in.",1077667200,,1993,4.763005780346821
2015822,3,B0001MDP36,"Three and a half stars...
Most online critics and Amazon reviewers will make you believe that this is a bad movie. Well, it's not. It's a very good movie. Very good. But it has a terrible flaw: failed expectations. Yes, this movie had everything it needed to be a true classic. A great story taken from a great novel, an Oscar winning director (Minghella), an Oscar winning leading actress (Kidman), an Oscar nominated leading actor (Law), an Oscar nominated supporting actress (Zellweger), a Civil war backdrop, a love story, lots of known actors in small roles and a gorgeous setting. However, in this case, the whole was less than the sum of its parts.
Many people have said that Kidman and Law didn't really have any chemistry. That they relationship didn't seem as strong as it needed to be in order for this characters to endure what they had to. I believe they're wrong. I actually bought the whole love at first sight, we only met a few times thing. Oddly enough, to me it was Kidman, not Law, who better portrayed this emotions (I say this because it was him who got the Oscar nomination).
Another thing that people seem to complain about is Rene Zellweger's performance. They say it's over-the-top, a ""Kathy Bates"" impersonation. I don't agree. I think she did a wonderful job in portraying wild spirited Ruby. She was indeed the comedic relief of the film, but she also had a few great dramatic scenes. I, for one, don't usually like her, but she convinced me this time around.
The story is not really complicated. ...It just goes on and on and on and on until you're more preoccupied with how much longer is it to the end of the movie, than with the characters or the story. After the movie ends, you're feeling relieved it's over instead of being fulfilled by it.
I guess that's why it wasn't nominated for Best Picture or Best Director. No one in the Academy watched the whole thing thru...",1077667200,,1904,4.602941176470588
2015823,2,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain was potentially an enjoyable film. The acting by Nicole Kidman was excellent. Her lover in this movie, played by Jude Law, needed more character development. He was basically a deadhead when they met and without any depth. The movie tried to balance the North vs. the South by making him a deserter. That way they could have a movie set in the south while balancing the remaining politics on the Civil War. Jude's character and Nicole's character need more development before he went off to fight them yankees.
Renee Zellweger's character was a light shining in the dark when she appeared inspiring the story line and giving a few moments of laughter. The movie helped me realize the extreme and multi difficulties the people of that era faced. I took this home with me, that we are so blessed today as a nation that it is hard to see from where we have come.
The nude scenes, which apparently are in there for the directors, were such a waste. There was no need for them and they detract from the film's possibilities. The time spent on nudity could have been better spent developing Law's character before heading to battle. It was embarrassing, useless and distasteful.
Overall, I give the movie a ""D"" because of the nudity, a ""B"" for overall acting (thanks to Renee), and a ""C"" for storyline/plot.",1077580800,5,1315,4.696969696969697

The film has a lot going for it.  The Civil War battle scenes (which just happened to be filmed in Romania) were some of the best I've ever seen.  The camera gets up close and personal and I felt the obscenity and destruction of the war, which was ripping my country apart.  I though the acting was excellent too.  But because the actors are so familiar to me, Nicole Kidman remained Nicole Kidman instead of the young southern preacher's daughter.  Renee Zellenger remained herself too and my thoughts during the film were only about what a good actress she is, cast as the hard working and rough talking woman who comes to live with Nicole Kidman while the men were at war.  Jude Law, as the young soldier who becomes disillusioned with war does his character well and the story flows through him.  But in spite of the colorful characters he meets along the way home, the story dragged.

War is cruel and it takes its toll on the humans who get caught up in it.  That theme was clear and the film made its point.  I understand the writer based the story on his own family's stories.  But I expect that all these stories changed a bit as they were passed down through the years and now somehow sound like tall tales instead of reality.  I guess that's the quality that kept me from totally enjoying the movie.

Don't get me wrong.  I do recommend the film.  It has scope, it has talent, it has story and it has really wonderful cinematography.  Just don't expect to feel you're right in the middle of it and believe it is real.",1077235200,7,1773,4.318181818181818

In the case of ""Cold Mountain"", however, I believe we're seeing the viewpoint of those studios in the California Republic, where everything back East is viewed as suspect.  The stalwart Inman (Jude Law) is a man without a country, as a deserter from the action in Petersburg, yet he must find his way back to the NC hills, to the one he's convinced he loves, Ms. Ada (Kidman).  The story is presented in an intercalary form, as Inman makes his journey and Ada makes it along through life on her own.  Her own, that is, until her ""hired hand"", Ms. Ruby (Zellweger) shows up, and eventually takes over.  Renee Zellweger as supporting actress pretty well saves the movie along with the farm, with her boisterous, no-nonsense attitude.
I am grateful, on the Sunday afternoon I went to see ""Cold Mountain"", that I was in the mood to obtain a large popcorn and a jumbo soda, for such rations were useful in sitting there for nearly 3 hours.  Also please note, this is beyond the abilities of one drinking a lot of soda to spend, without having to take a break to the lobby facilities.

I can't believe this movie will be well-received in many of the ""Un-Reconstructed"" parts of the real South, where to paint a portrait in which Yankees and Confederate loyalists are equally an enemy cannot look too accurate.  Due to the long and plodding plot, which became difficult to understand in a few spots, I grant this movie 4.5 stars, which they taught me in engineering school to round up to 5.

The cinamatography was excellent. Even though the movie was filmed in Romania, the visuals were uncanny with the Appalachians. Renee Zellweger gave the film all of it's heart. The reason it deserves the Oscar is because no film has ever portrayed the Civil War in that sense. The only reason it isn't nominated is so LOTR will have 0 competition. They cast Nicole Kidman to play a 21 year old because people appeared older back then. Same for casting Renee to play an 18, and Jude Law a 39 year old. I also wrote this review to answer some questions about the film that Anthony Minghella did not make clear in his rendition of the novel. The blonde headed home guard guy could fight because of his constant nosebleeds. (Stupid I know but back then it was dangerous) The reason why Inman and Ada were so in love before the war was made clear in the scene on the porch when Inman points out that sometimes love can be shown sometimes without words. It would've been more clear had Alisson Craus redone ""When you say Nothing At All"" instead of ""Scarlet Tide"" Somethings that suprised me about the film was Jack White's cameo performance and Natalie Portman's stellar performance. I was also suprosed by the excessive nudity which somewhat sleezed the film a little but in my opinion is excusable. I also didn't understand why it was slandered for being racist. It wasn't racist. Just because there were no leading black characters. There also were more than two appearances by a black person. (by the way I am not racist) (I despise racism in all ways) 3 black men are seen at the Battle of the Carater scene. Four are seen at Ada & Monroe's farm. and Inman passes 6 on the journey home.

2015835,5,B0001MDP36,"Charles Frazier's award winning debut novel is one of the best and most touching books I've ever read. When I knew it was going to be turned into a movie, directed by Anthony Minghella (of ""The english patient"", one of my favorite movies of all time) and featuring Nicole Kidman, I thought to myself: this is going to be good. I wasn't wrong.
Minghella's preocupation with detail is once again evident. During the movie, I was transported to the Secession War, I traveled beside Inman, I suffered with Ada, and I was brought up by Ruby's strenght. The screenplay is helped, in great part, by how good Frazier's story is. Many things happen during that four-year period, all of them  believable, interesting. Even the tragicness and the sense of doom that surrounds the story are powerful elements, while they keep the viewer always paying attention to what comes next, at the edge of the seat.
Renee Zelwegger is a little bit over-intense to my taste, but once again delivers a different character role and becomes one of the pillars of the story. Jude Law is the perfect Inman, quiet, respectful, with an intense gaze and driven by feelings that most people won't feel in their entire lives. Comparing to the book, Law's Inman is the most faithful character of the movie. And then there's Nicole Kidman. I've never seen her so beautiful as she is in ""Cold Mountain"". Her near-white blond hair and those gripping blue eyes in contrast with the wintry settings are a work of cinematography apart. Oh, yes, she keeps the good acting, too. Not to mention excellent support roles by (mainly) Natalie Portman, Kiefer Sutherland and Kathy Baker.
That is to say, I liked this movie a lot.

2015836,3,B0001MDP36,"I thought COLD MOUNTAIN was supposed to be a moving romantic love story set against the back drop of the Civil War. For a romance, there really isn't much romance and the Civil War is the back drop and that's all it is in this movie, a back drop. There was so much drama during the Civil War I guess the creators of the film just didn't want to add to it. I don't know.

Then there's the acting. I'll give the film's stars credit, they tried. However, their performances just don't mix. Nicole Kidman was miscast in this movie and though she tried her best, she just doesn't fit the part of a Southern belle forced to turn hardened working woman. Jude Law seems a little more realistic, but it's only because his pretty-boy faced is hidden behind a full beard or blood and dirt most of the time. In the few scenes we see him clean-shaven, he seems horribly miscast as well. Fortunately, the saving features of this catastrophe are the supporting actors and actresses. Renee Zellweger steals every scene she is in and totally outshines Kidman. Then there's the wonderfully talented Philip Seymour Hoffman who outshines Law in the few scenes they share. Finally, there is the brief turn by Natalie Portman as a young widow with a baby--her character says more about love and war than the rest of the movie combined.

I'm not for sure what Anthony Minghella was trying to do with COLD MOUNTAIN, but that guy should have stuck to writing European fairy tales and mysteries because when it comes to American historical fiction, he just can't hack it.

I found COLD MOUNTAIN to be very long and drawn out. The film was filled with scenes of unnecessary nudity. Besides that, when Kidman and Law's characters were on screen together, they just didn't seem to be the soul mates that they were supposed to be: their one passionate kiss says more about lust than love. Anyway, COLD MOUNTAIN is supposed to be based on Homer's THE ODYSSEY. If you want to see film that truly is based on THE ODYSSEY, watch O'BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? The time will fly by and you'll get a better glimpse at what an epic journey is really about. As for COLD MOUNTAIN, it's just too much fluff and not enough substance.",1076198400,3,2187,4.5456852791878175
2015837,3,B0001MDP36,"I just saw this less than an hour ago, and am disgusted by the poor casting job the director did when searching for a suitable female lead. Why did they have to settle for Nicole Kidman? Her Southern accent is so pitiful, it sounds as if she spent two days working on it, then decided it was good enough. There is actually one line (""I'll go and look for food."") where her actual British/Australian accent comes out! There are a few more phrases where this happens, but that was the most noticeable. I tried to put this lack of a soft Southern drawl down to the manner of speech in her supposed place of birth, Charleston, an urban setting, but still, this is disgraceful. Why the three stars, then? Those are for Jude Law, Rene Zelweger, and the supporting cast. They were all excelent.",1076112000,3,787,4.472222222222222
2015838,2,B0001MDP36,"I REALLY, REALLY did not want to see this movie but did it as a favor to someone.  The thought of Nicole continually begging her lover to desert the war with the plea ""Come back to me"" was too depressing for words.  Would I really need to sit through 2 hours of this??
As the movie started, I was intrigued and horrified by the battle scenes and the very humanistic approach taken.  Neither side really triumphed and neither side really knew what they were doing.  But, for the sake of survival and morale, many jumped into the killing.  The boys from Cold Mountain, however, appear to have fought more out of loyalty and duty - a truly noble lot, or so they are trying to get you to believe.
Interspersed with these gruesome scenes are flashbacks that develop Inman's (Jude Law) and Ada's (Nicole Kidman) love story.  Their characters were interesting, but I don't think the script allowed them to be who they wanted you to believe they were.
  - Inman's character was supposed to be a honorable man who never talked; but he deserts the war and talks a blue streak through the rest of the movie, and so you keep forgetting these key parts of his character.
  - Ada's character is supposed to be a shy, insecure but refined gentlewoman.  However, as the movie progresses, the only thing you really grasp is that she's a spoiled rich girl who can't do anything for herself.
Fairly soon into the plot, I was sorry to see that the movie was settling right down into the groove that I was afraid of - her desperation, his readiness to desert for her.  While this movie did a particularly good job at not glamorizing war, it also dismissed (intentionally or unintentionally) the heroism of many soldiers who have fought loyally for our country.  If you are sick of fighting and you have someone you love at home, why not wander home.  It's the right thing to do.
One may argue that he was fighting for the south...and, of course, the south was fighting for slavery and was wrong.  I am a northerner who only somewhat understands the south's stand.  HOWEVER, many noble men stayed and fought for noble reasons for the south.  Desertion is not admirable.  More than anything, I felt they were constantly manipulating the story to make it as PC and admirable as possible - noble, honorable, loyal, willing to risk lives to save friends, don't believe in slavery, don't believe in war, saved by a woman's love, home is where the heart is.
All that said, what the movie was particularly good at showing was the humanity, depravity, and even potential goodness of soldiers on both sides.  Throughout the movie, southern soldiers were just as dangerous to run into as northern soldiers - but there was also hope for mercy and goodness with each.  That take was refreshing.
Right at the point when I had sorted through the anti-war messages and was about to throttle Ada, the real spark came to the movie (that it desperately needed!).  I apologize for ever questioning Zellweger's acting abilities.  When she arrived on the scene as Ruby, she gave the movie a whole new spirit.  She brought in the gritty triumph that our ancestors needed to survive.  She was a complex character - whom they likely tried to make too complex - that really brought hope and humor and everything you could admire in a character.
The one final thing worth mentioning, which really lowered my opinion of the film, was the abundance of nudity - all of it unnecessary.  While I think we all know that depravity lurks around every corner during war and that women usually are involved in one way or another, it was not necessary to show so much...and for minutes at a time.  I'm not sure why an R rating is suitable for a movie with one swear and for this, but I wish they would admit that movies like this are [dirty] and should move up the rating scale.  It's not artistic, it's pushing the boundaries.
All in all, I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone.  If there was a TV edited version, I might recommend it...but there are probably better ways to spend your time.  However, if you end up watching it for any reason, there will be great things you can enjoy in it.",1076025600,5,4134,4.563685636856369
2015839,5,B0001MDP36,"`Cold Mountain' is a visually remarkable film with an emotionally charged story. It chronicles the young love between a shy and beautiful minister's daughter, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) and an introverted labourer, Inman (Jude Law). Unfortunately for the tentative love between the two, Inman is drafted to fight for the Confederates in the American Civil War 1861-1865. Performing his duty, he fights with the rest of the Confederate men but becomes disillusioned and decides to return to Cold Mountain in order to be reunited with Ada. Will he make it? Will the two have anything in common if he returns? Will Ada be the same woman he knew? You have to see this film to have these questions answered.
This film succeeds in portraying the torment that Ada is experiencing and the desperation that Inman is feeling so much that you simply just want to two to be reunited as soon he leaves! Cue Ruby (Renee Zellweger) who comes in to add a humorous dimension to this romantic epic and to help Ada deal with the hardships of war.
One may argue that Cold Mountain is extremely graphic and violent but this Civil War drama cannot show the audience what happened in those years without being explicit. True, the violence is unbearable at times but this film succeeds in showing that the true experiences of war included rape, pillaging and senseless murder.
The acting in this effort was sublime. Jude Law was electric as the quiet but clever Inman who did not say much but revealed enough to show that he was full of personality. He truly deserves that Oscar nomination and I am keeping my fingers crossed for him. There is no doubt in my mind that this was a career-altering role for him that will reap rewards.
Nicole Kidman always delivers in her films and she does not fail her either but I especially commend her for playing her character with subtlety, allowing her co-stars to shine. Renee Zellweger was superb; she has proven herself to be a versatile actress. Best supporting actress? No doubt about it.
Magical film with beautiful camera work and is brought to a new level with its stellar cast.",1076025600,3,2101,4.743169398907104

Rene Zellewenger was outstanding she really deserves the Oscar for this performance. Jude Law what can I say he is a HUNK! Outstanding actor in fact deserves the Best Actor award.

What's best about this movie are the characters met along the way, which are reminiscent of ""Huck Finn.""

Ada has found herself living in disarray after the death of her father. Only the help of Ruby is keeping her alive at first, but then she begins to come into her own. She also lives, waiting for the return of Inman, and writing him letter after letter.
Some of this movie works, some does not. Inman's long journey home as well as Ada's struggle to survive are engaging, but the whole love story did not work for me. For as little time as they had together before Inman left, I find it difficult to believe that relationship would be enough to sustain either of them through all their trials and tribulations.

On the other hand, it did spoil some surprises in the movie... but I love the movie all the same! The movie added some important parts (the Civil War battle scenes for one) and took out some unnecessary ones too.
The movie itself is very hansomely made... the music, landscapes and situations that the characters go through are simply breath taking. The storyline is sweet and not entirely drawn out. Jude Law's performance was simply superb. It was heart-wrenching and very real; he was a picture-perfect Inman (and he wasn't too bad to look at for 2 1/2 hours either!). Nicole Kidman turned up a satisfactory as Ada, the woman Inman loves and is trying to get home to. Ada's half of the movie is saved from being a bore by Renee Zellweger. She brings humorous obnoxiousness and life to Ada's failing farm.
Overall, this movie was just excellent, although some scenes were very hard to watch. Hard meaning too real. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart (that's everyone).",1075766400,3,1133,4.5588235294117645

The movie shifts between his ""odyssey"" , his love (Nicole Kidman) and her increased detatchment, then reaatactment thanks to Zellwegger (sp?) to the now horrible society run by some idiots in the town who will shoot anyone for anything (mostly being a deserter or harbouring one) and flashbacks of the past (mostly at the beginning) before her love left for war.
Everything about this movie was perfect.  I have yet to read the book, but I really want to now!  The acting was superb, Jude and Nicole were excellent and Renee really brought some comic relief to an already very dramatic film.  Some people may find some of the scenes pretty unbearable (ie: some of the war scenes, but primarily the scene with thwe baby and the union soliders).

2015845,5,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountains"", one of the best films of the year (it's a crime it wasn't nominated for Best Picture), is beautifully crafted, stirring, poetic tale of love, loss, and the will to survive.  Directed and adapted to the screen by the wonderful Anthony Minghella and boasting a stunning cast of Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellweger, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Jack White, Brendan Gleeson, and Donald Sutherland, this film is truly a force to be reckoned with.
""Cold Mountain"" tells the story of Inman (Law), a carpenter working in Cold Mountain, North Carolina in 1861 when the alluring, elegant, and well-educated Ada (Kidman) and her father, Reverend Monroe (Sutherland), move to the Blue Mountains from the city.  Inman and Ada, in true Hollywood fashion, are instantly taken by each other and engage in restrained flirtation, Ada's preacher father and their different social classes being the bulwark from romance.  Soon the Civil War begins and the entire young male population of Cold Mountain departs in eager anticipation of glorious battle.  Inman and Ada engage in one fleeting, hungry kiss before he rushes off to join the departing procession.
During battle, Inman is wounded and, after reading Ada's numerous earnest letters imploring him to return to her, deserts the Confederate army and embarks upon an Odyssey-like journey back home to his true love.  Meanwhile, Ada's father has died, leaving her helpless and alone on their 300 acre farm.  Soon Ruby (Zellweger) arrives and offers Ada her services in exchange for food and shelter.  Realizing that she simply cannot manage on her own, Ada agrees.  The rest of this spellbinding film flashes back and forth between Ada, being ""all that keeps Inman from sliding into some dark place"" and Inman, being Ada's ""last thread of courage"".  Though these two souls barely know each other, they both remarkably become the single thing in each others world worth living for, worth fighting for.
When boiled down to it, ""Cold Mountain"" is simply a beautiful testament of the human soul's fierce will to survive and, as corny as it sounds, the power of love.  If it weren't for their love, neither Ada nor Inman would have found the will and courage to survive after their lives had been shattered by the brutalities of war.
The seamlessly intertwined music plays such a large emotional role in this film.  From Gabriel Yard's haunting score to Alison Krauss' tender songs, the music in this films helps to create an absorbing atmosphere that sucks you right into the Civil War.  In addition, John Seale's breathtaking cinematography complete with sweeping views of the snow-encrusted Blue Mountains makes this a film you simply must see on the big screen.
This has been a very difficult review for me to write.  Upon first seeing ""Cold Mountain"", I was pleased with the film, but definitely not as taken with it as I soon came to be.  That all changed in the weeks following.  I simply cannot get this film out of my head.  The hope, the sacrifices, the pain, the loss, the love.  It really sticks with you.  It's hard to put my feelings into words and I sincerely hope that this review has given you the incentive to go see this film, and by doing so, embark upon an unforgettable journey.",1075507200,255,3280,4.921960072595281
2015846,1,B0001MDP36,"The critics' darling - Cold Mountain - a collection of every sorry, hackneyed Hollywood cliche about southern whites:  racists, rapists, incest ridden,  murdereous, traitorous, vengeful, dim witted, hypocritical, backward, etc.
Of course, the hero of the film is someone who proclaims, ""I'm not fightin' for a cause I don't believe in."" Therein is the official doctrine for any modern day southern male anxious to win a free pass to proper society and acceptance of modern, enlightened, and shall we say, cool, people.
Notice no critic took the movie to task for having no African-Americans anywhere to be seen, except for the young innocent slave girl about to be mudered by a deranged Christian minister. And she wasn't given a word of dialogue.
And where were the Black Union troops who fought so valiantly at the battle of the Crater? Digitally erased from history.
And if the Southern deserter were changed to a Northern deserter making his way back to a cold mountain in the Adirondacks or the Berkshires, and no other story point or scene were changed, would the critics have thought it was such a wonderful and precious film?

2015847,5,B0001MDP36,"I thought this movie was excellent. And while I agree with Rebecca from Saskatchewan that this film is not for children, I find that most R rated movies are not! And in regards to her comment on too much blood and guts...well honey it is the Civil War, the most costly in American human life. But I can tell you that this movie followed the book as closely as possible, something the director tried very hard to do. I have read a lot of books on the Civil War and believe me far worse details could have been written in the book or shown in the movie.
I thought the directing, acting, and editing were superb. Watching the movie I did not think so much of the two sides of war as I did for the major effect it had on everyone. Although the south's stand was rather complex it's one that would never have been victorious because of the very institution it allowed to exist...slavery. One that was wrong in every aspect. But this particular movie did not delve much into slavery just as the 1965 movie Shenandoah did not. But that was an excellent movie too.
I can take the blood and guts if the story reflects the human triumphs over the very sacrafices made. And when wrongs are made right!
My father served in Vietnam and perhaps the most touching scene to me was when Inman tells Ada that he has changed and is not the same man. No, indeed he could not be the same but he will be loved even greater... as was my father.",1074988800,8,1421,4.266666666666667
2015848,5,B0001MDP36,"This film depicted a budding romance between a young couple which was cut short by the arrival of the Civil War. Ada Monroe, the sophsticated, classically educated daughter of a minister arrives in rural North Carolina, and develops an attraction to a local carpenter and farmer, called simply, ""Inman"". The viewer witnesses the impact of the Civil War on the lives of a small community and most importantly on the lives of these two young people and those whom they know. The story of Ada and Inman becomes every southerners story and in a larger sense every human beings story who has ever witnessed and been affected by war ... the desperation, the hope, the privation and the outcomes.

The cinematography is extraordinairy and striking ... gorgeous smokey mountains (of Romania, where it was filmed, I have been told), lovely green valleys and lush riversides and small lakes. The film begins with a close-up of shimmering water, where the light casts shadows and reflections on the shiny surface - the viewer hears the sad and eery fiddle muisc of the blue-grass genre. Next you are in the trenches with the Confederate Soldiers ... we zero in on ""Inman"" as he touches his most prized possessions, letters and a photo of Ada, plus a paperback book that helps him connect to the world outside of the war zone. As the soldiers revive themselves from the most recent skirmish, Inman reflects on the people around him, the battle itself, the Civil War in general and the memories of his sweet life on Cold Mountain, NC. We view the scenes he is recalling of his life with Ada - how they met and how their relationship blossomed.  The scenes are so believable and real. One is transfixed to experience vicariously the lives of these young people, their thoughts, their hopes and dreams ... Then unexpectedly --- a dynamite explosion sends body parts flying, the acrid air is filled with the stench of burning flesh, the sounds of men moaning, others yelling for help. The air is reddish gray from the smoke and fire. Bodies lie with minimal movement, some are fixed in the plaster cast of the death mask --- as previously stated ... the cinematography is superb. So, one can not *really *smell* the burning flesh, only imagine it .. nonetheless ... it is there, you know it. Inman makes it to the hospital ... he gets a letter from Ada that confirms in his mind, the need to leave the war, he becomes a deserter ...  Along the way, in his quest to return to Ada -- he meets an unusual group of characters, the Rev. Veazey, the goat woman, and the blind peanut seller. We experience the hardships of the journey back home, escaping and evading the Home Guard, who are men that do not fight but recruit soldiers for the Confederates and return deserters to the war, unless they attempt to escape in which case they are shot. The personalities of these men are very real. The symbolism of drinking apple cider becomes evident ... it represents home, everyday reality, which we often take for granted. Ada experiences a vision about Inman under strange circumstances and this gives her hope and encourages her to fight for her future. She learns that her classical education is of no value when practical survival skills are required ... luckily she is sent a very adept female farm-hand and helper who becomes her best friend, an unlikely partnership that often happens during stressful times.

The actors and actresses in this film are given high praise for their performances. Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, and Renee Zellwegger, as well as the lesser characters all were phenomenal.

Our two main characters are Ada (Nicole Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law) two Cold Mountain residents dedicated to there reunion after the war, but the war drags on and there correspondence is the only thing that unites them in a terrible time of American History.
The movie tells of Inman's journey back to Ada and the parrallel story of Ada trying to survive on her fathers farm. Both characters take a journey in spirit and determination to survive the horror that has become there existance during the war.
I loved the intertwining of music and drama in this movie. Anthony Mingella did, as expected, an excellent job etching the powerful feelings of hope and dismay with haunting music written by Sting and performed by the clear voice of blue grasses own Alison Krauss. I am from North Carolina am familiar with the native music of the area and thought the music in the movie very similar and so wonderful.
Although, this is a Love Story more than a movie of the American Civil War it stirred the feeling of my Southern Roots. The movie did not contemplate the reasons for the Civil War but it was a vehicle for ours lovers seperation. I found the depiction of the Petersburg battle flawed not entirely accurate to history but then again the war is not the focus in the movie.
I was in aw of the cinemontography of this movie, magnificent. A gorgeous movie that needs to be seen.
Perhaps I am biased, since I am a North Carolinian, but I thought this movie excellent, bittersweet, wonderfully acted, and crafted by the best in the movie business today. I would recommend this movie.

2015855,3,B0001MDP36,"After all the heated rumours and scandals surrounding the Cold Mountain, it is finally in the theatres.
Cold Mountain is a much participated movie after all the hype that Nicole Kidman and Jude Law created, and given the fact that the production crew went to Rumania to shoot a movie about the American Civil War is another subject to rave about.
As mentioned, Cold Mountain is about the Civil War. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, we don't have a chance to see all the broken limbs flying across the skies and blood staining the clouds. We do have battle scenes but they are not the main concern. It is about a promise between a man and a woman in the chaotic age of war. They hold the belief and they both trusted each other in a way that it floats beyond the common standard of trust of the modern age. The love story is no doubt the main storyline of Cold Mountain, but what impacts the audience most is how certain believes could be both constructive and destructive.
Positively, the trust and belief of Nicole and Jude gave them strength to struggle through the hard times and finally reunited. However, negatively, the belief of other people in the Cold Mountain costs them more than they could foresee. The concept of people killing people due to the difference of belief  echoed around the mountain ranges of the Cold Mountain. Gun shots are omen of life in the movie, they are barely constructive. People were just eliminating differences through their own way, and the scariest part is they believe that they were doing justice and rights. Cold Mountain has a lot of moments that could sink you to the bottom of the ocean, far below where Titanic lies. It is a depressing movie at many circumstances. Maybe the director is trying to use all these incidents to show that positive endurance could possibly lead to good stuff in the end.
Nicole Kidman did a fair job as Ida but she is just too stunning for a mountain village woman. She did come from the city but at the same time after 3 years of struggling in the mountains and doing all the farm work, how could she still look so delicate and elegant? It just doesnt seem right at all. On the other hand Renee Zellweger put dust on her face and turn into a complete village woman is much more promising and convincing. She is basically stealing a lot of audience attention in the whole movie. The audience would long for her to come onto the screen again and again.
Jude Law is still Jude Law. There isn't too much of a surprise from him since Talented Mr. Ripley and AI. He is even better when he was in Enemy at the Gate. Maybe the character is not strong enough for him to show his ability, but to be fair he did have his moments in the movie. This is especially true when he thought that Ida has already forgotten him at the first moment he saw her again after 3 years of separation. That expression was right to the spot and this is what we want to look for from him as an outstanding actor.
The short appearance of Natalie Portman gave the audience a very small surprise in the movie, and sure it will be good to see her acting with people instead of in front of a blue screen that did her nothing good so far in terms of an acting career.
Production wise, Cold Mountain is a serious production, but it just didn't fix the gears completely well together. As mentioned, it could be depressing and could give the audience a pretty anti-war feeling from time to time. It is not surprising that some people compare the movie with the current political situation around the world. Well, movie in certain ways is a reflection of the world and it would be quite sad that people didn't learn from history after all these years. The horror of difference in belief could be devastating to poor innocent people who have to struggle to just live.",1074124800,4,3796,4.4618705035971225
2015856,4,B0001MDP36,"COLD MOUNTAIN by Charles Frazier is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read.  It is a heart-wrenching story about Inman, a soldier fighting for the South in the Civil War, his desertion from the war, and his subsequent journey home.  But it is also about Ada, the spoiled and impractically raised preacher's daughter who is left to fend for herself after her father dies.  It is touching to watch Ada grow before your eyes as she learns to work and take care of herself for the first time, and becomes self- sufficient.  When I discovered they were making it into a movie, I was ecstatic.  I recently saw it, and I give it 3 stars out of 4.  It was a good movie, but not great-(let LOTR win this year!)
First, I wanted to write this review because **I feel as though everyone is missing the point of the story somehow**.  Some have stated they couldn't feel sympathy for Inman because his character was cold, and it glorified a deserter in some way.  Others felt Ada's relationship with Inman was superficial and trite.  It's very important to understand Inman's motivation for leaving the war in order to understand Inman as a person, and his relationship with Ada.

In my opinion, Inman is one of the bravest and most human characters any author has ever written.  In the novel, Inman's inner turmoil is more evident than in the movie, so readers will find themselves better able to sympathize with him than viewers.  Frazier's novel shows Inman is becoming dehumanized by his experiences in the war.  He has seen too much.  He has watched his friends murdered, he has taken lives with his own hands, he has done what he can to survive, and it is not honorable.  It reminds me of the Wilfred Owen poem ""Dulce Et Decorum Est"" or Randall Jarrell's ""The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner"", because those poems get across to readers there is nothing glorious about war.  What the book gets across beautifully, and where the movie fell short, is the effects of war on the human soul.  Inman's spirit is being BROKEN.  There is a black place inside him he does not know if he can ever recover from.  This is why he knows he must leave.
Inman doesn't know if he can ever recover from what he's been through.  He has been irrevocably affected by what he's been through, this horrible tragedy that is war.  He sees Ada as his salvation; she is the light at the end of his tunnel, the only possible chance for hope.  Even in the novel, they didn't have much interaction before Inman left for war.  It seemed as though there was much more left unsaid between them than was ever actually put into words.  However, Ada and Inman saw something in each other that was enough to sustain them.
There were many good points about the film.  Beautiful scenery and cinematography....fabulous costumes...rich characterization.  The two main characters were well cast with wonderful chemistry.  After thinking back on Kidman in ""Far and Away"", I knew she could pull off Ada's character, which is supposed to be cold and somewhat haughty.  Jude Law is a perfect Inman.  I especially enjoyed the moments between them when they said nothing, yet you KNEW some sort of understanding had passed between them.  Their love scenes were passionate and tasteful.  I loved Donald Sutherland as Ada's father.  Kathy Baker captures the stoicism and stalwart nature of Ada's neighbor Sally Swanger.  I loved Giovanni Ribisi as the money hungry Junior, and Natalie Portman will bring tears to a few eyes as the lonely young widow trying to survive a hard winter with her baby.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is an excellent Veasey, a priest Inman meets on the journey to Cold Mountain.  When Inman meets him, Veasey is attempting to dredge up the courage to kill his pregnant lover--whom he has drugged and stolen from her home in the middle of the night-so the townspeople won't realize what a lecher he is.
There was one thing that threw the movie off for me.  Renee Zellweger plays Ruby, a strong young woman who comes to help Ada gain control over the house (she's being terrorized by a rooster when Ruby shows up).  Ruby becomes Ada's teacher in all things pertaining to country life and running a farm.  Zellweger did a nice job getting across the conflicted way Ruby felt in regards to her father, the fiddle playing Stobrod, who abandoned her repeatedly when she was a child.  Their relationship was touching.  But while Zellweger provided some much-needed comic relief, her acting was COMPLETELY OVER THE TOP.  She did not so much ""steal scenes"" as she hurled herself into them and shoved everyone else out of the way.  I did see a few reviewers (a precious few-most people seemed to think she was brilliant and deserves an Academy Award) who felt less would've been more.  The movie is not meant to be hilarious, and her scenes felt too contrived--every time she came onto the screen, people would start to chuckle, knowing something ""amusing"" was going to happen.  To me, she wasn't amusing so much as just overreaching her role.  I was especially frustrated when she RUINED the moment at the end of the film when Inman is finally expressing his feelings for Ada.
One of the most touching aspects of the film is when you think about the spirit of the characters in it.  No one was rich; they all struggled to make it through a horrible experience with few resources of their own.  Yet they were still willing to give food off their own tables (and out of their children's mouths) in order to keep some stranger from going hungry.  That kind of attitude and camaraderie was simply unforgettable.  Go see the movie, but don't miss out on reading the book.",1074038400,17,5634,4.648129423660263
2015857,5,B0001MDP36,"I loved this movie!! I read the book first, and although I found it to be somewhat disappointing, the movie definitely is NOT. Great story (though sad), great music, great movie. Men will like it for the historical factor, not to mention the blood and guts of the battle scenes. Women will like it for the touching love story that it is. All I have to say is-go see this movie, and bring the Kleenex.",1073952000,,400,4.346666666666667
2015858,4,B0001MDP36,"My immediate notion was not that ""Cold Mountain"" needed to be cut, especially because I can see where some characters and situations needed to be fleshed out a bit more, but rather than the pacing needed to be picked up a bit.  But director Anthony Minghella has deliberately slowed the pace of this film, to reflect both the measured progress that Inman (Jude Law) is making trying to get back to Cold Mountain, and the long period of time that Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) has been waiting for him to return.  Before I go farther, I should point out that ""The English Patient"" has the distinction of being the Oscar winning film from my lifetime that has most left me cold, so I am beginning to think that Minghella and I are just on totally different wavelengths.
I really got the sense that Charles Frazier's novel was lurking behind this film, because there had to be more to the power of love than binds Inman and Ada together, despite the fact that their relationship before the start of the Civil War consisted of an exchange of tintypes and less than a minute of last minute kissing.  I fully understand why the picture and the idea of Ada would sustain Inman during the trauma of being a Confederate soldier for four years, but Ada's steadfastness is rather puzzling, based on smoldering looks and very few words from the man she has decided is to be her mate.  She does declare at one point that she will not leave because her ""last thread of courage is to wait"" for Inman's return, but the film does not provide much substance to give weight to those words beyond the fact she stays and waits.  I would think the novel provides more, but perhaps I am wrong on that score.
The Battle of the Crater sequence that opens the film is fairly impressive; it was filmed in Romania which explains why so few of the Union soldiers were blacks (the battle was notorious because the Yankees made the error of running down into the crater, without ladders, instead of running around the giant hole in the Confederate defenses, and the Rebels refused to let the black troops surrender, slaughtering them instead).  In addition to the giant melee of battle there are also quick telling details, such as a soldier having his clothes blown off of him by the explosion.  The chief asset of the film is a superb supporting cast that includes Kathy Baker, Donald Sutherland, Brenand Gleeson, James Gammon, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Natalie Portman.  To give you an idea of how deep this cast goes, ""Cold Mountain"" is a film that has Jena Malone in a bit part.
Several things distracted me from enjoying this film more.  The first was that I really did not have a good visual sense of Cold Mountain, so that every time Inman gazes at mountains I have no clue if he is getting any closer to home.  Compare this with another film sure to be nominated for Best Picture where you know Frodo and Sam are heading for the mountain with the smoke and fire coming out of it.  The second was that the villain of the piece, Teague (Ray Winstone), who once owned all of the land on Cold Mountain but is now running the Home Guard as his own gang of thugs, perplexed me.  On the one hand he seems overly concerned with hunting down deserters, which I say knowing that this is a way of his confiscating property.  But on the other hand he wants Ada and she spends years on a farm by herself and with one other woman for company, and it never occurs to him to just go and take her and be done with it.  Finally, there was a scene in the middle of the film where the Home Guard goes after some deserters and I found myself thinking that men who had served four years in the Army of Northern Virginia should be able to take these local clowns.  The film vindicated my belief, but it took a while to prove the point.
Rene Zellweger as Ruby Thewes, the country gal who shows up to help the delicate Ada save the farm is a sure bet for an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress and would have to be considered the frontrunner.  Her performance runs counter to the measured pace of the film overall and her poetic description of the war's insanity much be a reach for her character, but is still memorable.  Law has little dialogue in his scenes, but turns in the best performance of his career working mainly with his eyes.  The competition for Best Actor will be fierce this year, but he might be able to wrangle a nomination.  The same can be said for Kidman, especially if Mirimax decides to put its weight behind this film.  ""Cold Mountain"" is one of those movies where your expectations are so high that falling short might it seem a lesser film than it really happens to be.  If this is an Oscar winning film, it is one that does it more by the numbers than by the force of the cinematic narrative that has been created.",1073692800,7,4798,4.4419134396355355
2015859,5,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain,"" Anthony Minghella's film of Charles Frazier's novel, is a mournful, beautiful and occasionally profound film about the futility of war, the persistence of love and the desperate attempts of people to survive in wartime. The quiet, delicately nuanced performances of Jude Law and Nicole Kidman in the lead roles are deeply moving, and Renee Zellweger brings much-needed comic relief as Ruby, a plain-spoken farm worker. The film's episodic structure may distract some viewers, but the vignettes are extremely powerful per se, and they allow for some wonderful supporting performances--by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Eileen Atkins, Kathy Baker, Donald Sutherland, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Lucas Black, Brendan Gleeson, Ray Winstone, Jack White, Ethan Suplee and others--to be placed strategically in the movie like jewels in a crown. ""Cold Mountain"" makes the sad but undeniable point that at times of national tragedy, all the survivors can do is pick up the pieces, rebuild their lives as best they can, and find joy wherever they can. With fine performances, excellent music (by Sting, Jack White and others),  and exquisite photography by John Seale, ""Cold Mountain"" lingers in our minds and hearts long after the closing credits roll.",1073692800,21,1259,5.456410256410257

I challenge anyone to cite an actual example of a home guard within a small southern town during the Civil War that actually murdered and brutalized its own town's inhabitants.
Men in this movie are almost universally portrayed as brutal,
mean, drunk, abusive or morons.  Women are larger-than-life heroic.
A Christian preacher in this movie was planning to kill a young black woman he had impregnated.  This was so he wouldn't be discovered by his wife/and or congregation.  I found this to be a gratuitous insult toward Christianity.
This movie is a continuous series of feel-bad episodes right up to the finale.  We left the movie feeling down.
An English actor portrays the leading man.  An Australian actress portrays the leading woman.  The entire movie was shot in Romania.  No wonder this American Civil War movie felt strangely distorted.

2015862,3,B0001MDP36,"About twenty minutes into watching ""Cold Mountain,"" I thought to myself, ""this movie is going to win some kind of Oscar."" Mabye not the best picture, but probally for an actor or actress or visuals or adapted screenplay. This movie is Oscar material from the start to finish. But does that make it a good movie? Cold Mountain was about two hours and forty minutes in lenght. If this movie was only two hours, it probally would have been great. I took all of the parts that I loved about ""Cold Mountain,"" and put them together and the movie still made sense without everything that I cut out. But is it possible that a half hour could take away two stars in my review. My goal is to prove to you that it can.
Let me explain to you what ""Cold Mountain"" was about. It's a Civil War film whereyour main heros are part of the south. Parts of it are told in flashback from. We are introduced to W.P. Inman who is in the army. He is looking at a picture of a women. We flashback in a while before where the women is discovered to be Ada. Ada and her father have just arrived in Cold Mountain, North Caralina. Inman looks at Ada and likes her from the start. His attraction comes just when the war begins. The two passionatly kiss just as Inman is leaving Cold Mountain. He promises that he will return and he goes off. The two talk to each other through letters and over time Ada's father dies of age, and Inman gets wounded in battle. Inman becomes a deserter of the army and tries to return home. Oh his odessey home he meets people like Sarah who is a widower with a young child, Veasey who is a disgraced mininster, a women named Maddy who cares for Inman over a short period of time. But things are not going well in Cold Mountain. A local man named Teague wants to be with Ada, but she refuses, because she still has hope that Inman will return from the war. She also gets help from Ruby who helps Ada with the land in exchange for free living and food. Teague begins searching for people who left the army and begins to look for Inman. Ruby's father, who she claimed dead, also returns, with his musician friends. But all Inman can think about it finally returning back to Cold Mountain, to see the women that he loves.
""Cold Mountain"" is like the classic poam Homer's Odessey. I even used that word in my summary of the plot. I guess you can say the two are both extremly similiar in how the plot goes and even some of the supporting characters. But it is not loosley based on the poam at all. It is based on a book by the same title, which I have not read yet. But some of the parts in the movie could have been cut out. I can see why they kept them in the movie though. The makers of the film are trying to show you Inman's sturggle. If you cut out what I thought was useless, it would have been to much of a hop, skip, and a jump for Inman to return home.
The ending I liked alot. I won't tell you how it ended, but because of everything that happens throughout the movie, at the end, you think to yourself, ""I didn't think that would happen."" ""Cold Mountain"" is one of those movies that are great, but overlong. Some movies call pull off great lenghts like ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and ""Catch Me If You Can."" I probally wouldn't go out of my way to own ""Cold Mountain,"" but if I did recieve it as a gift I would surely watch it. I also wish that mabye I should have rented this instead of paying money in the theatre. Good movie, but to long for me.
ENJOY!

2015863,5,B0001MDP36,"A film by Anthony Minghella
Anthony  Minghella is the Award Winning director of ""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", but as strong as his credentials are, having seen both of those movies the ""Anthony Minghella"" name is not enough to bring me to the theatre.  Despite ""The English Patient"" winning the Academy Award for Best Picture, both of those movies had a cold emotional tone which made it nearly impossible to connect with any of the characters.  This seemed to be a recurring theme with Minghella, and while his films have been technically proficient, up until this point, they have not done much for me and I have not enjoyed his movies.  This has changed with ""Cold Mountain"".
""Cold Mountain"" is based on the bestselling novel by Charles Frazier, and while the novel is suburb, I was not certain how well it would translate to the screen.  It is set during the Civil War.  Inman (Jude Law) is a Confederate soldier from North Carolina.  He is wounded during the war, and when he is read a letter asking him to come home, he deserts and has a long journey home, trying to return to his love, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman).  This is the basic premise of the movie, but there is much more going on in this film.
For the first hour or so of this movie, Anthony Minghella intercuts the story of Inman in the Civil War with Ada Monroe first arriving in Cold Mountain with her father, the Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland).  Ada is a sophisticated city girl with no knowledge of the earthy, simple skills that are essential for survival in rural Cold Mountain.  Her father is ailing, and when he dies, Ada is left alone to care for the farm and to take care of herself.  Before her father passes away, however, Minghella shows us how Ada and Inman meet and fall for each other.  Inman is already away fighting when the Reverend dies.  It is Ada's letter that compels Inman to return home.
Ada is alone on her farm and she is struggling to even survive, and she would not even do that much if it wasn't for the generosity of her neighbors.  They give her food, and though she is embarrassed to accept it, she has no choice.  It is when Ada thinks she is at the end of her rope, she is given redemption embodied by Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger).  Ruby is the ultimate provincial woman, a woman who can work like a man and knows everything that Ada does not.  Ruby works with (but not for) Ada.  She will only accept a place to sleep and food to eat, but no wages as she has no need of money.  It is Ruby who reshapes Ada's farm and brings Ada back to life again, although to a life that Ada never knew before.
These scenes are intercut with Inman's return journey.  He encounters a variety of people, some friendly, some try to imprison Inman for desertion, some who are looking for a life they have lost, and they all shape his journey.  There are two people who, while they may not have the largest impact on Inman, they are the most notable and interesting as characters.  The first is a disgraced preacher named Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Inman involved himself in Veasey's life (for a reason which I will not spoil), and Veasey attaches himself to Inman for a time.  He is both entertaining as well a foil for Inman.  Inman is not a talkative man, and Veasey serves this role perfectly.  The other is a woman named Sara (Natalie Portman).  Sara is a young Civil War widow with an infant.  Inman turns to Sara for shelter during a storm, and the scenes with the two of them are some of the best of the movie.
I had said that I had not really Minghella's previous movies because they were emotionally cold.  This is not the case with ""Cold Mountain"".  This is one of the best pictures of the year and it deserves any awards that it wins.  It is a beautiful movie with a lot of heart, and I would recommend this as an Oscar Contender.  This is an excellent movie and Renee Zellweger will certainly win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.",1073520000,10,3972,4.443370165745856

When we finally do get to see the payoff, it is predictable and disappointing. Much of the action on screen, though impressive, was far too violent (for violence's sake) and sporadic. The movie was unfocused. Because Minghella failed to introduce his characters properly (even the three leads), I didn't feel for anyone who lived or died, good guys or bad. Donald Sutherland was wasted. It isn't one of the best movies of the year, it's one of the worst.

2015866,4,B0001MDP36,"In 1864, during the last months of the Civil War, a soldier named Inman (Jude Law) lies in a military hospital in Virginia. There, Inman  decides that he's had enough of War and that the Confederacy can manage the path to its now-inevitable defeat without him. He determines to return home to his sweetheart in Cold Mountain, North Carolina. So he deserts the army and sets off on a hundreds-of-miles trek to return to Miss Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), a woman whom he knew only slightly but who captured his imagination and his heart in their few brief encounters before the War started three years earlier. While Inman has been struggling for his life on the front lines, Cold Mountain has suffered as well. Without men to work the fields, the little farming community is stricken by shortages of food, money, and goods. Ada, an educated and genteel preacher's daughter, always excelled in the arts and academics but could do nothing useful. With the help and prodding of a rough, tumble, and exceedingly practical woman named Ruby (Rene Zellweger), Ada becomes self-sufficient and brave in the face of the War's hardships and horrors. Still, she pines after Inman, as if restoration of the world's sanity somehow rests on his coming home to her.
""Cold Mountain"" is based on the novel of the same name by Charles Frazier and was  adapted for the screen and directed by Anthony Minghella. This is a picturesque and touching adaptation, with two attractive stars in the lead roles and lots of period ambiance. We see the War only at the beginning of the film, but the reenactment of the Battle of Petersburg may be the best Civil War battle that I've seen on film. Inman's journey home is fraught with danger from both Confederate and Union troops and littered with odd characters that he meets along the way. The most interesting of these is a preacher of dubious ethics played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. There are so many idiosyncratic characters, unusual situations, and lucky breaks that it stretches credibility, but Inman's great longing to return to his life and love is palpable and usually overwhelms questions of credibility. The character of Ruby, however, is out of place in North Carolina of 1864. She is certainly entertaining, and Rene Zellweger does a fine job with the role. But the role is from another time and place. That isn't the only lapse in faithfulness to the culture of the time, but it's the most glaring. In the film's  defense, creating a story that accurately represents the perspectives of another time and yet appeals to contemporary audiences may not be possible. ""Cold Mountain"" has its faults: It's too long. It's contrived at times. It's not entirely credible. But the performances of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law hold the audience's attention despite these flaws. Anthony Minghella succeeds in keeping the preoccupation that these characters have with one another foremost in our thoughts throughout the film, so that the story does not seem to meander even though it does meander. The ability of Kidman and Law to consistently convey their intense longing and the feeling that the world for them relies on their reunion holds this film together and holds our interest. I can't say that the two actors have chemistry because they are rarely together. But they are definitely on the same page emotionally. Kidman and Law are too old for their roles, as is so often the case in period films, but they fill them admirably nevertheless. ""Cold Mountain"" is a bit long, but it's a good story driven by two charismatic lead performances. Recommended.",1073433600,13,3578,4.891268533772652

Renee Zellweger costars as Ruby, a feisty farmhand who works with Ada on the homefront.
This film is a period piece that has a true epic sweep, yet never loses an intimate connection with the main characters.  The production design is full of fascinating and thoughtful details that make the film a joy to watch.  But it's also often harrowing and graphically violent--Minghella does not flinch at exploring the injustice and brutality of humankind towards itself.
The performances are all superb.  After having distinguished himself in a number of noteworthy supporting roles, Law really proves himself a great leading man here.  Kidman brings both delicacy and steel to her role--a southern belle faced with daunting wartime challenges.  Zellweger delivers a rich, earthy, zesty performance; she is a perfect foil for Kidman and their characters' relationship is one of the great highlights of the film.  The three main actors are superbly supported by the rest of the cast.
""Cold Mountain"" is often quite grim and brutal, but is leavened by earthy humor and irony.  Ultimately I found the film to be life-affirming.  It's a love story and a war story, but regardless of genre it's a superbly crafted and genuinely moving film.",1073347200,50,1450,5.0588235294117645
2015868,4,B0001MDP36,"As one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, due to its long list of A-List actors involved, a much respected director, and the general subject matter, Civil War epic ""Cold Mountain"" paints a poignant, devastating and beautiful portrayal of one of the most turbulent times in American history.
Set in the small Southern town of Cold Mountain, North Carolina, at the beginning of the Civil War, it follows the story of Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), the daughter of a preacher, and Inman (Jude Law), a young worker, who although are attracted to each other cannot express their feelings; only sharing a few words and a single kiss before Inman and the rest of the men in the town are sent off to fight for the Confederates. Throughout the next four years, Ada sends Inman dozens of letters of devotion and hope, telling him tales of home and praying for his safe return. Inman, who finds himself at the end of his wits while suffering through the horrors of war and after reading her letter while recovering in the hospital for a gunshot wound sustained in battle, decides to become a deserter to find his way back home to Ada. Thus, he begins a perilous journey back to Cold Mountain, not only hiding from the Yankees, but his Confederate comrades, and encountering many helpful and hindering characters along the way. For Ada back in Cold Mountain, her life seems to be falling apart as her house falls into dilapidation, and a band of lawmen terrorize the small town; putting laws into action that condemn those who are deserters or those who house them, as well as anyone else they see fit. So, it comes as a relief for Ada when spunky Ruby (Renee Zellweger) shows up at her door, with the intention of helping her with the farm and getting her life back on track.
Under the direction of Anthony Minghella, who is best known for the haunting ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (also starring Jude Law) and the 1996 Best Picture ""The English Patient"", ""Cold Mountain"" succeeds in portraying a world torn by war in a devastatingly realistic fashion, not only focusing on the battles or political events that made up the war itself, but also the impact it had on those left behind. The love story of Ada and Inman has a modest beginning, yet grows until you can almost feel the raw, underlying connection between their souls and the hunger for each other protruding from the film. Jude Law is near flawless, as the young man fearing for his innocense lost, and the sheer determination he demonstrates throughout his journey in many situations can also be shown through a single glance of his dark, deep eyes. Nicole Kidman gives a slightly less thrilling performance, yet still shines as Ada, who never loses hope for Inman, and shows her character's strengths and determination in the fierce set of her jaw, and throughout the challenges she comes across. Renee Zellweger also delivers an enthralling performance as Ruby, with just the right amount of spunk, humor, and emotion, to win over the audience. The fascinating characters portrayed as Inman continues his long journey home and the rest of the supporting cast, while varying in personality, set a marvelous backdrop for a lush story rich in human emotion and immaculate attention to detail. Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Charlie Hunnam, Giovanni Ribisi, Kathy Baker, Cillian Murphy, and Jena Malone, among others, make up a splendid ensemble, with the stand out performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman as the slimy but lovable preacher and Inman's companion, and Natalie Portman as Sara, the desperately lonely housewife.
As one of the most brutally realistic movies of the year, you must know what you are getting yourself into before watching ""Cold Mountain"". For the viewers with weak tolerances, it has more than a few scenes which will upset your stomach and tug your heartstrings. I myself found some parts hard to watch, but I was also enthralled by the visual aspects, performances, and wonderful direction of the film. Without a doubt, I believe ""Cold Mountain"" will do very well at the Oscars, if not in gold stauettes, than with a numerous amount of nominations, each more than deserved.",1073260800,4,4187,4.857342657342658

2015870,2,B0001MDP36,"I'm told the book was great, but this film is absolutely dreadful... Jude Law stars in this drearily on-the-nose romantic drama as a Confederate soldier who survives numerous hardships at war, only to decide, late in the game, that it's time to desert and head home to his sweetie, Ada, stiffly played by Nicole Kidman (an actor who is seriously flirting with artistic overexposure...)  Ada's been having a hard time of it as well, with her father dying and the family farm in jeopardy as a local robber baron, who desires both her and her land, appoints himself head of the ""home guard,"" a thuggish local militia that takes it upon itself to sadistically hunt down and execute deserters and other folks they just don't happen to like the looks of.  Not a single scene in this film had an unexpected outcome, as the script (such as it is) flips monotonously between hardship/relief, hardship/relief, hardship/relief, hardship/relief, and finally, vague yet predictably melodramatic resolution. ""Cold Mountain,"" the movie, has been praised as the new, defining Civil War epic, setting the bar higher than any work seen before.  I would beg to differ.  ""Gone With The Wind,"" corny as it was, is at least more of its time, and more in keeping with the time it portrays -- heck, even ""Birth Of A Nation""  has a more honest emotional core than this tawdry mishmash of romance novel cliches and neofeminist anachronisms.  This does have, I suppose, its entertainment value, but I mostly felt oppressed by its over-obviousness and blunt, un-nuanced presentation.  I just wanted the film to end, so I could go home and pop something better into the VCR.",1073174400,6,1645,4.89568345323741
2015871,4,B0001MDP36,"Doing its best to pose as an Old Hollywood prestige picture, ""Cold Mountain"" bursts at the seams with love, war, pathos and comedy, underlined by a sentimental, romantic quest. It is not a perfect film, and at times hardly a film - more like a handful of Civil War shorts strung together - and yet director Anthony Minghella, pitched in a struggle on location in Romania fit for a tell-all book one day, delivers a lush, hot-blooded epic that does some justice to Charles Frazier's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.
Set during the closure of the Civil War, the movie's opening stunner shifts freely in time; as confederate solider W.P. Inman (Jude Law) greases up for a key battle, he recalls a short courtship he had begun three years earlier in the titular village with a literate preacher's daughter, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). They shared looks, a few words, one kiss, but the chemistry between Law and Kidman is there, and when Ada, having lost her father, requests by letter that Inman abandon the war to help her run the farm, we buy his desertion as he embarks on an Odyssian journey back to her.
Minghella cannot escape that Frazier's book is essentially two stories, and the movie embraces a structure that shifts from Inman's hike to Ada's homestead struggles. It seems unlikely that Ada will survive another winter until human hard tack Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) emerges from that section of the backwoods where they grow Cute Precocious Folk. Inman, meanwhile, encounters a fallen preacher (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a bigamist (Giovanni Ribisi) and a war widow (Natalie Portman), among others.
""Cold Mountain's"" structure as it is, the movie must work - and does - scene to scene in depicting the Civil War era, the hardship of those left behind, and the particular brutality of the Home Guard (brought to chilling life by Brits Ray Winsome and Charlie Hunnam), a unit charged with punishing deserters, and those who harbor them. Minghella and editor Walter Murch left whole chunks of the movie on the cutting room floor - they had a five-hour film initially - and what remains are evocative vignettes built to pack em in the movie houses, a shrewd collection of the book's events that conveys Frazier's atmosphere without ever quite stopping to let it marinate. Considering Minghella took a year to shoot the movie on a $90 million budget - gargantuan for the subject matter at hand - he's done what he could without losing his shirt like the Ciminos and Coppolas before him.
Zellweger delivers the standout performance as the chirpy Ruby - stompin, shoutin, roustin about. It's Academy worthy, and Zellweger carries on like she knows it.  As strong as Kidman's connection to Law, there's a fiercer enjoyment in her eyes when Ada and Ruby tromp through the cold, building fences; after a flurry of angry performances in brutal films - ""The Hours,"" ""The Human Stain,"" ""Dogville"" - the actress seems to have come out the other end, and she's luminous again. Law, in full method, disappears deep into Inman, playing the lead intriguingly as bystander - think Tom Cruise in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" - achieving a silence that Minghella never trusts against the two blonds trading barbs on the other side of Carolina. Portman, in a truncated part, rediscovers her acting guts.
Stung by the cool reception of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" Minghella directs to the middle; his work borders on crude. The visuals, while epic and lavish, are murky and indistinct, possibly intended. ""Cold Mountain"" is meticulous to a fault, but not showy - there is nothing resembling that dazzling final shot of ""Ripley"" - nor too keen on leaving much to the imagination. When a woman's bottom is to be shown, tis shown. If Minghella is trying to pull himself out of the graceful repression of his earlier work, he's done it with a few ill-timed jolts.",1073088000,4,3832,4.877300613496932
2015872,4,B0001MDP36,"This film is not what I expected. I thought it was going to be alot of civil war battles and a corny love story, but it wasn't. This movie does a great job of presenting two seperate stories. One story is that of Jude Laws character who leaves the bloodshed of the civil war and his long and exciting journey home to his love(played by Nicole Kidman). Kidmans character meanwhile does her best to survive and keep the home fires burning while she waits for her love(played by Law). Also included into the story is a group of heartless badguys, that will stir your vengance emotions.
This film has something that everyone can enjoy. For women this film has a great strong female cast and story line. For men, this film has somewhat of a western Unforgiven type feel at times. The entire cast was perfect! Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger give amazing performances. Kidman looks better then ever in this film and Zellweger played a fantastic supporting role in this film!(worthy of a best supporting actress award).

2015875,4,B0001MDP36,This movie is very graphic in its violence and depiction of the Civil War battle in the crater. My only complaint is that American Civil War Units were not used to film this part of the film.  It is portrayal of the women left behind to survive that is so moving.  Their struggle to survive while waiting word from their loved ones is truly something to remember.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman show us what wonderful actors they have become.  But I must say that Renee Zellweger steals every scene she appears in.,1073001600,2,511,4.462365591397849
2015876,3,B0001MDP36,"But this time, I think he may have missed.
Cold Mountain is beautifully shot, but it's heavily derivative (Gone with the Wind, Somersby, Dangerous Liaisons, Titanic, O Brother Where Art Thou and even Minghella's own The English Patient); there are too many foreigners mangling southern accents (Kidman, Winstone, Law); the denouement is far too predictable (and not nearly a good enough pay-off given the Odyssey Inman goes on to arrive at it); and the film is three-quarters of an hour too long.
By the time the credits finally rolled I had got past the point of caring whether Inman ever found his way back to a woman he had barely ever known; instead my brain was completely enveloped with the gluteal agony of sitting still for so long. Even the lights came up in the theatre in double quick time, as if the cinema itself had had enough and wanted to go home.
Plus points - Renee Zegweller, while chewing scenery (and what beautiful scenery it is to chew), is hysterical and adds real sparkle to anotherwise pretty bleak film. Also, the computer generated falling snow effect is pretty neat (but not so neat you can't notice it).",1073001600,7,1133,4.7272727272727275
2015877,4,B0001MDP36,"Anthony Minghella both directed and wrote the screenplay for ""Cold Mountain,"" the film version of Charles Frazier's Civil War epic.  Jude Law plays Inman, a disillusioned Confederate soldier who goes off to war with a patriotic spirit, but is repelled by the brutality that he sees on the battlefield.  After being wounded, he  escapes the hospital to start his long journey back to Cold Mountain, North Carolina.  Inman wants nothing more than to be with Ada, the woman who waits for him back home.
Anthony Minghella is most successful when he depicts the horrors of the Civil War.  His opening sequences, which recreate a bloody confrontation between Confederate and Union soldiers, are mesmerizing and repellant at the same time.  These scenes are almost balletic in the way that Minghella choreographs the explosions, the hand-to-hand combat, and the bodies flying over a corpse-ridden field.
However, Minghella is less successful when he flashes back to Cold Mountain and Ada.  Nicole Kidman seems uncomfortable playing the prissy Southern belle, Ada Monroe, who is transplanted from Charleston to this rural setting when her father, nicely acted by Donald Sutherland, decides to set up his ministry there.  Kidman is not very believable as this helpless and pampered lady who is shocked when reality smacks her in the face.  Also artificial is Renee Zellweger, as Ruby Thewes, a tough-talking and self-reliant woman who helps the inept Ada tend her farm when she runs out of food.  Zellweger chews up the scenery with her thick southern accent, her rolling eyes, and her broad gestures. In her case, less would have been more.
Jude Law is more subtle as Inman, a quiet man who is caught up in forces that he cannot control.  His character is a bit like Odysseus returning from the war and facing a series of trials on his long journey home.  The scenes of Inman's journey are extremely effective and are some of the best in the movie.  I liked Natalie Portman, as a grieving Civil War widow with a sick baby, Eileen Atkins, as a crone who is a whiz with home remedies, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as a hypocritical reverend who loves women more than prayer.  Although Law is occasionally burdened with stilted dialogue, he does a credible job of conveying the feelings of a gentle man who wants nothing more then to live in peace with his lady love.  The villains in ""Cold Mountain"" are far less subtle in their portrayal of evil incarnate.  Ray Winstone is particularly vicious as Teague, a bully who rules Cold Mountain with an iron fist while the menfolk are away fighting the war.
The cinematography, by John Seale, is glorious.  The film captures the wild beauty of North Carolina, with its scenes of snow swept mountains in the winter and verdant pastures in the spring and summer.  Overall, the movie is uneven, but there a few moments of brilliance that make ""Cold Mountain"" worth visiting.",1073001600,5,2904,4.891836734693878
2015878,3,B0001MDP36,"I'm not very good at making Oscar predictions, in fact I'm usually wrong, but, even so, of all the films released in 2003 I think ""Cold Mountain"" will win ""best picture"". It has already managed to earn 8 Golden Globe nominations including ""best picture"", ""best director"", ""best actor (Jude Law)"", and ""best actress (Nicole Kidman)"" which usally indicates Oscar success. Now you may be asking, does it deserve to win? That's a different story.
 I've heard a lot of people compare this movie to classic epic romance films such as ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Gone With The Wind"". But, to do so I feel is a mistake. By telling people this you are creating such a high level of expectation (considering you like those movies) that ""Cold Mountain"" will never be able to live up to it. At first I fell into this trap and was expecting a masterpiece and soon I thought about it and realized it doesn't matter if this movie is not as good as those because you know what? Few films are as good as ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"", that's why we consider them classics.
 ""Cold Mountain"" has two faults that I can think of, and because of them it stopped the movie from leaving a greater impression on me than it could have. The movie is about a young man named Inman (Jude Law) who meets a reverend's daughter (Nicole Kidman) soon an attraction starts, but, as fate would have it the Civil War breaks out and now Inman must go and defend the south causing him to think about Ada (Kidman) every day and wait until the day he can be in her arms again. Now this all sounds fine, but the problem I have with the movie is the two barely know eachother, in fact both characters make the same comment. I've never read the book by Charles Frazier, but, if this movie is a faithful adaptation my guess is this probably worked more in the book than in the film. Books can get away with certain things movies can't. What would have drawn me more into the story would be if there were more love scenes between Law and Kidman this way we, the viewer, can now understand the love between them. We would be able to feel more for him. As the film stands now, we go along for the journey yes, but, I felt the movie lacks the depth that could have been. The other problem I have with the movie has to do with Renee Zellweger. Now, I must in fairness admit when Zellweger appears the movie seems to come to life, she brings a certain vitality with her. But, there's a story going on here concerning her relationship with her father that I found unnecessary. Zellweger though plays her character Ruby in the same way Vivian Leigh played Scarlett O' Hara when she killed the soldier and stole from him and wore a curtain as a dress lol. She plays her character with that same spunk.
 Do these things hurt the movie? No, not really. ""Cold Mountain"" still succeeds in other areas. I enjoyed Anthony Minghella directing and his attention to detail. I also liked the cinematography by John Seale and the acting by the cast is wonderful, I especially enjoyed the supporting roles given to Philip Seymour Hoffman and Natalie Portman. With this movie I came to notice what a good actor Jude Law is. If you've seen ""A.I."" and ""Enemy at the Gates"" you'll see he is able to play different roles. Plus Nicole Kidman keeps up her winning streak after her impressive work in a film that came out earlier in 2003 entitled ""The Human Stain"" here though I think she gives the better performance. *** 1\2 out of *****
 Bottom-line: An at times effective attempt to bring back the romantic epics of the past. Has some impressive acting from the leads and supporting characters. Minghella directing has many inspired moments.",1072915200,4,3677,4.5
2015879,3,B0001MDP36,"The movie to which all-broad, big, hearts-on-its-sleeve, sweeping extravaganzas tip their hat is, of course ""Gone With The Wind."" That ""Cold Mountain"" also deals with the era from 1861-1865 only makes it look more forlorn in comparison with its noteworthy predecessor.
It isn't that ""Cold Mountain"" doesn't have much going for it, for it does. It's just that the story of Ada (Nicole Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law) just isn't as exciting and diverse as that of Scarlett and Rhett: maybe because Ada and Inman have only know each other for a couple of weeks before Inman goes off to fight the War between the States though both Kidman and Law do what they can with their gravely underwritten roles. The real star of ""Cold Mountain"" and the one who inevitably runs off with this movie is Renee Zellweger as Ruby: an Annie Oakley style gal from the backwoods who can hunt, put up a fence and shoot a gun better than any man.  Ruby comes into Ada's life after Ada's father dies and she is in dire need of a helping hand and a friend most of all. There is more than a hint that Ruby may have secret desires for Ada especially after Inman's return, but it is all handled with restraint and care except when someone accuses Ruby of ""churning Ada's butter.""
Every Anthony Mingella directed film looks beautiful and ""Cold Mountain"" is no exception. And the battle scenes are as harrowing as the ones in ""Saving Private Ryan."" But except for Zellweger and maybe Jack White (of the White Stripes) as Georgia there is little else exciting or unusual here. With all this star power you would have thought that ""Cold Mountain"" would blow you out of your seat with Passion, Love and Emotion but as it is, it merely sits there like your Christmas tree after December 25: big, overblown and begging to be dismantled.",1072915200,4,1797,4.615625
2015880,1,B0001MDP36,"I'm really starting to get sick of these movies that use superficial relationships in a pathetic attempt to make the viewer care. Nicole Kidman's character was on the screen with Jude Law for literally 2 minutes before he left for war, and they just talked, like anyone else. They acted like they couldn't live without each other, and two people don't have that until they face and overcome big problems together, overcome obstacles together, etc.
And another thing, there was hardly any footage of actual war on the battlefield. Yet, at the same time that there wasn't footage of war, the movie was supposed to be depicting how difficult it was for the women at home to be living, knowing that their husband was risking his life. Had we seen more from the battlefield, we could have understood this more clearly. But, instead, we see them sitting at home, decapitating roosters and decapitating goats. Yeah, real nice.
If you enjoy fake, superficial relationships, then you'll enjoy this movie. I personally am more of a fan of the genuine ones, but, then again, a lot of people in the real world don't seem to be bothered by fake ones. So, if you're a fake person, you'll like it just fine.",1072915200,15,1192,4.708133971291866
2015881,5,B0001MDP36,"This year has seen many films without hobbits try to make claims as great epics. Only Cold Mountain comes close in the epic department to that film about a ring. A movie that not ony is a great love story, but also a great war film. This film does not dare make war look pretty and shows the disenfranchised state of all the parties involved, especially the people of Cold Mountain. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman do a great job of making the audience believe in their love, despite the very short amount of time they share together. Every glance means something, as does every word these two characters speak. You understand why Jude Law's character would go on this odyssey to find his love and you believe in it and want it to happen. I also appreciated how the movie does not glamourize the war or make the soldiers noble and loyal heroes. The soldiers in this film may have once been hungry for war, but now realize that it won't solve anything and doesn't have a true cause worth fighting for. The film is well cast with many recognizable actors showing up in small parts and Law and Kidman both put in Oscar-nomination worthy performances, although neither deserves to win the award. The performance that does deserve to be recognized is Renee Zewellger as Ruby. She not only steals this movie, but makes a case for one of the greatest performances of the year period and maybe all time. It is a truly memorable performance and she does an excellent job displaying corage, strength, humility, determination, humor and resourcefulness. This movie is good without her, but becomes great due to her performance. She makes this film a must see for every one.",1072915200,5,1657,4.639455782312925
2015882,4,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain has a fantastic cast, and they all deliver terrific performances.  But by far the star of the show in my opinion is Renee Zellwegger (sp?).  I'm not a huge fan of hers but she nailed her character perfectly.
The only real issue I had was the movie didn't do a great job in the beginning making a strong connection between the two main characters played by Nicole Kidman and Jude Law.  It was difficult to believe that these two people who barely knew each other would be so steadfast in their attempts to find each other after the war.  But right before Law goes off to battle, the spark between he and Kidman was believable.  Their long-distance relationship, or the hope of it, became more and more believeable as these characters developed throughout the film.  The hardships they endured, and the lack of hope each had in anything but the thought of reuniting, really made you root for Law's character to make it home alive. The ending was appropriate and powerful, leaving me sad but fulfilled.",1072828800,2,1013,4.662921348314606
2015883,5,B0001MDP36,"COLD MOUNTAIN, in the novel by Charles Frazier, was an elegantly written, poetic tale of inner musings on nature (the mountain itself seemed a main character), on the intolerable and irrational wastes of war, on the effect of brief encounters becoming obsessions over time, and on survival of body and soul against all odds.  The book was deeply moving in its use of word images to create a past world that seems too oft repeated.  Anthony Minghella found ways to make this inner story into a visually coherent if a bit overwrought film.  Instead of the action taking place in the minds of Inman and Ada those actions are recreated in flashbacks and action scenes that would stress even the best film editor's talent, all is visually explained.  But it works.  The Civil (a misnomer if ever there was one to describe how uncivil that historical event was!) War scenes are gruesomely real, the seasonal changes of autumn and winter are beautifully captured, and the story itself is related smoothly.  Jude Law gives a carefully and thoughtfully controlled performance as Inman without a shred of British accent, making us completely believe his much tested honor and the destruction of his belief in civility even after he deserts the Confederate Army to return to his Cold Mountain home. He is a consummate actor now.  Nicole Kidman makes Ada even more strong than the book version, bringing to life a wholly credible, fragile to strong woman whose will to survive is never broken as she waits for Inman's return from the war.  Quite surprisingly Renee Zellweger finds all of Ruby's crudeness and buried tenderness and plays with a keen sense of 'plain comic relief' without ever stooping to slapstick.  The rest of the cast is equally superb: the sense of ensemble playing is likely due to Minghella's sensitive direction.
There are extended moments when Hollywood excess threatens to crush this poetic paean against war and one wonders if this epic should really be tied up so quaintly in the final ""everything is OK afterall"" scene.  But these are minor flaws in an otherwise beautifully realized film.  Despite preferring the book to the film, I would still give this movie 5 stars.",1072828800,3,2186,4.897018970189702
2015884,4,B0001MDP36,"A nice adaptation from the book (especially the beginning war scene which isn't in the book at all but should've been). Casting is well-done, and the overall performance is delivered in fine tune with the book. The film is rushed towards the end, however, and it suffers a blot on its otherwise gleaming surface: it's unconvincing. The story doesn't proceed in a persuasive manner, and at the end it leaves little 'residue' of loss, of the personal weight which drags on the remaining survivors--where is this? This is quickly glossed over without its appropriate due given the length of the film which is devoted to its anticipation--somewhat of a letdown as we move unceremoniously into the final cutscene: years later and the family is picture-perfect with no signs of a haunting past, where did it all(the whole of the film up until now) go? The last cutscene renders the rest of the film meaningless and utterly silly. Not the way to end an otherwise moving account of the moral gravity of love during a time of civil strife and separation.",1072742400,,1045,4.811111111111111
2015885,4,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" is a fine movie filled with good performances by all the actors involved. However, I did have a few quarrles with the film:
1) The needless sexual content.
2) The film has its slow moments (But coming from North Carolina, I was able to see past them and have a good time nonetheless).
3) The Battle of the Crater (which took place at Petersbrug, Virginia on July 30, 1864) is recreated with authenticity and a you-are-there approach, but the scene almost lacks the emotional touch that Ron Maxwell was able to capture in his cinematic epic ""Gods and Generals"" without much blood.
Despite these problems, ""Cold Mountain"" is a fine film that should take its place beside such great Civil War epics as ""Gods and Generals,"" ""Gettysburg"" and ""Glory."" Grade: B",1072656000,5,770,4.796992481203008
2015886,4,B0001MDP36,"""Cold Mountain"" is a good Civil War movie with a twist. The movie shows the ugliness of all wars and the human, emotional and communal casualties resulting from them. It's a very timely film in a war torn world.
The acting is good (Nicole's accent isn't that good, though.) The cinematography is incredible and so is the score. Renee does a good job being a hillbilly but she sort of goes over the top with her performance. Jude's performance is OK and not very spectacular.
The love story, which is the supposed crux of the film, is contrived and weak. I couldn't relate to the claimed passion between the two main characters (Nicole's and Jude's.) It is very illogical at best.
This is a really good drama, even though the romance is flawed. Fortunately, the other events taking place in the movie make watching it a great experience and compensate the flaws inflicted upon it by the unrealism of the romance.
I recommend this movie as a drama/war movie NOT as a romance flick.",1072656000,4,979,4.632183908045977
2015887,4,B0001MDP36,"Cold Mountain, the new epic from screenwriter/director Anthony Minghella is not terribly amazing.  Though it is a fine film and a handsome adaption of the Charles Frazier novel, it feels like it is lacking something.
  Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweiger star and deliver fine performances.  Jude Law delivers a very nice performance, I was very pleased by it.  Also Zellweiger gives one of her best performances too as the farmer who is helping Nicole's character survive during the war.
  The premise of the film is nothing spectacular, mainly a simple love story like Titanic.  The film takes place during the Civil War.  Jude Law plays Inman, a Confederate soldier who must go and fight in the war, Nicole Kidman plays Ada, a woman who he soon meets and falls in love with.  While barely knowing each other they develop a deep, intimate relationship.  Soon, during the war, Law becomes seriously injured and wants to find his way back to Ada.
  This being an $80 million epic delivers some fine battle sequences, not too many or as grand as I had originally anticipated.  The beginning starts off fine with a spectacular explosion and a fairly big battle sequence.
Cold Mountain is rated R for Violence and Sexuality.  The violence is reasonably bloody, not exceptionally graphic surprisingly for an epic war film.  There are battles with guns, bayonets, explosions which also depict some graphic
injuries.  The sexuality is steamy not really explicit.  There is one fairly erotic situation near the end of the film.  There is also some semi-nudity.
  Cold Mountain has already been nominated for 8 Golden Globe Awards, (the most nominated picture this year.)  Nominations include Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor as well as Best Actress.  A fine picture, but I don't think it lives up the hype which it has been receiving.  Also I should point out the film is a little slow at points which can be tedious and nearly make you fall asleep.  Even though the storylines are totally different, I preferred The Last Samurai, which was a lot more exciting and featured better battle sequences.  Possibly worth seeing in theatres, but would make a fine rental.",1072656000,,2173,4.917355371900826

2015890,3,B0001MDP36,"What is with Hollywood and the concept of love in the mitts of great disasters? There can be no greater example of this obsession then the highest grossing film of all time, Titanic. Though the Oscar darling can be blamed for the most recent trend, it is not the first to start this. There's the classic Casablanca and many other films set in and around World War II that do the same thing that is happening today in war features. Many films have come out recently and tried to duplicate the same result as Titanic but none have come close. Miramax is hoping they can break that statement with their film set in North Carolina during the Civil War. The Great War that divided this nation from 1861 to 1865 has become a hot subject as of late but few have taken the time to really focus, accurately at least, what this war was truly about. Instead they focus on side issues and stories that were only a small piece of the puzzle that was this time period. Gangs of New York, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio, is a perfect example of this. If the subject matter of Cold Mountain and the historical time period are blended in a way that creates an accurate interesting tale then maybe more and more films will be able to do the same.
The story follows the young Confederate soldier who has deserted his position in the army in order to return home to be with his pre-war sweetheart. Inman is a man of very little words and actions but when he discovers the new missionary's daughter, Ada, he is at even greater loss for words. The two young North Carolina residents seem to take an interest in each other but that development is quickly put in jeopardy as Inman goes to join the other young men of the South to defend their homeland from ""Northern aggression"". After he is wounded after the Siege of Petersburg, he deserts the Confederate army and starts a long and tiresome journey back to Cold Mountain. Along the way, he encounters many different characters that both help and hinder his journey home. Back in Cold Mountain, things are no better for Ada for the farm goes into disarray after the death of her father. With help of a drifter named Ruby, she hopes to survive long enough to reunite with Inman once again. The story for Cold Mountain may have been a bestselling plot when it was in book form but up on screen it is nothing short of disappointing. The plot is pretty predictable with several actions leading up to ""major"" events that could be seen from a mile away. The feature runs into the same problems as Gangs of New York, which opened this same time last year, in that it tries to cram too much into three hours and loses its focus not too far from the end.
Though the cast seems to be an impressive group of Oscar favorites, few of them really show off why they should be labeled as such in this film. The biggest problem has to be Nicole Kidman's character, Ada. In the beginning of the film, it seems as though her character should be a little younger then Kidman herself makes her out to be. How old is Kidman? Forty years old? Whatever age she is, the way the character is presented, it seems she should be a lot younger. Another problem is featured after the death of Ada's father. Obviously Ada is going through rough times taking care of herself and the farm all alone but her faces just holds up so well. Boy! The medical care back in the 1860's may have been crap but make-up was just spectacular. This sarcasm being said, they could have made her character a little less dolled up, cosmetic-wise, as the film progressed. Despite a somewhat impressive performance by Jude Law, the bottom line is that the so-called relationship between Inman and Ada lack substance. They barely know each other and yet the audience is made to believe that they act as if they have known each other all their lives and once the war is over, they can go back to where they started? And critics should especially be yelled at believing this after ranting on such films as Daredevil and Pearl Harbor for attempting the same thing Cold Mountain tries to pull off. If there is anything good about the cast, it has to be Renee Zellweger's Ruby, who really picks up the film where it seems to be heading for a continuous decline.
Overall, Cold Mountain manages to outdo last year's Gangs of New York but like the English Patient, it takes the film a long time to get to its predictable and pointless conclusion. Once again the Union on the basis of the Civil War are demonized and made to look like idiots no more so then in sequences like the scene that involved Natalie Portman's unnecessary character. Even the issue of freeing the slaves, which was not the main issue of the Civil War though many try to make it that way,  isn't as focused on correctly as they could have made it. What would have been a lot more interesting then the bland ""love story"" would have been the more grand battle sequences and issues of statehood and homeland but those are only battered about here and there without developing into anything grand scale. The film presents a valid topic of the Confederacy wanting to start a war and even doing anything they could to fight the North but when it comes to the end of the war, they blame everybody but themselves for what has been brought upon them. Director Minghella could have done something like that but chose not to. Once again another lackluster Civil War feature is presented to the movie-going public. Hopefully the American education system can pick up where this film fails to lead up to.",1072569600,2,5530,4.502487562189055

But the movie by itself is done pretty well. I would have to agree with other reviewers that Renee Zellweger as Ruby is one of the best parts of the movie. Even though there were few scenes with both Ada and Inman together, I liked the love story between them, though it would have been more convincing if they'd had something of a relationship before he left for war. All in all, a great movie, especially on the big screen.",1072483200,2,593,4.120689655172414

Although you may be sorry you did if you are expecting more romance than blood.
It is not the chick flick I expected based on the trailer (obviously, I haven't read the novel).
To get the guys to go, point out that:
*  Nicole Kidman shows a bit of flesh
*  There is, flat out, a lot of blood.
*  Torture, rape, executions, explosions... blood from every angle.
I suspect the Civil War atrocities are accurate (perhaps someone else knows) -- and, if so, there is probably historical value in many of these scenes.
However, to me this story felt like 60% bloodshed, 20% mournfull sadness, and 10% romantic epic.
Not my cup of tea... but I think others will probably enjoy it.",1072483200,4,750,4.420289855072464
2015893,5,B0001MDP36,"I read COLD MOUNTAIN several years ago, but as nearly as I can remember the screen play faithfully reflects the book. Charles Frazier, the author who wrote the award winning book has written that Inman and his love Ada were his great grandparents. I hope he liked the film.  I think COLD MOUNTAIN is splendid. Thank you Harvey Weinstein and Anthony Minghella for taking a chance on real art.

Although the film was shot in Romania, as one who lived in North Carolina (Asheville in the 1940s), I can testify that the terrain in the film looks as much like the ""hills"" as anything I can remember. As one who married the descendent of Confederates like Inman and is old enough to remember veterans of the Civil War (or War Between the States as Southerners call it), I can testify that the attitudes of the young men who went off to fight appear to be accurately depicted. They were enthusiastic because they thought they were defending their homeland, but few of them really understood why they were fighting. Many families had a brother fighting another brother. At the time of the Civil War, only about 10 percent of the whites in the rebellious states owned slaves. This was truly a ""rich man's war and a poor man's fight.""
However, COLD MOUNTAIN is not about ""the war""- the war is the context for an incredible love story.  The screen play and direction are fabulous. ALL actors are outstanding. ALL of them deserve Oscars. Nichole Kidman is Ada.  Jude Law is Inman. Rene Zellweger is Ruby. Eileen Atkins is the old goat woman. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the randy preacher. Et cetera.",1072483200,6,1587,4.6571428571428575
2015901,4,B0001MDP36,"Well, of course it's derivative!! It's the Odyssey, reset to North Carolina circa 1864. Inman's travel vignettes match Odysseus's long journey home; including a blind oracle, a group of sirens, a wisewoman, and being caught between Scylla and Charybdis, with Natalie Portman's story being the most affecting of these. Meanwhile, Ada as Penelope has only Ruby Thewes's Telemachus and Odysseus's old nurse Sally to help her keep her farm and keep away her unwanted suitors.
Minghella's addition of the Battle of the Crater, while not included in Charles Frazier's book, was a good choice. That battle substitutes well for the Fall of Troy. As a native North Carolinian, I was disappointed that Cold Mountain was filmed in Romania, but the scenery is beautiful, and very similar to how the Appalachians must have appeared prior to this century's development. And the music is affecting and appealing.
Yes, the dialogue sounds stilted to us, but if you have read actual Civil War era writings, it is accurate.  The men's letters tend to use extremely flowery language by modern standards, while the women's diaries are compellingly stark in their acceptance of hardship.
To those unhappy with the casting, look to Gone With the Wind - much-too-pretty British actress Vivian Leigh, forever the iconic Southern heroine Scarlett. Parallels? And Jude Law's  Inman is a much more believable and battle-scarred hero than soft Ashley or roguish Rhett.
Unfortunately, unlike Homer, Minghella takes too long to get this story moving.  And I'm just not a big fan of flashbacks. The first 30 minutes of the movie needs heavy editing.",1072483200,,1618,5.144486692015209
2015902,5,B0001MDP36,"Place a sweeping romance against the backdrop of a major feud that tore a nation apart, get the director of an all-time epic like ""The English Patient"" to make it, and you've got yourself a sureshot Oscar worthy movie.
In the case of Cold Mountain -- and as much as I enjoyed the scintillating book -- the fluttering hearts of Nicole and Law make for the least interesting bits of motion picture. While they are pretty good in their individual rights, their mutual chemistry is no better than a rack of His and Her towels.
The movie is apparently shot in the visually gorgeous Romanic instead of the North Carolina as in the book's setting. The soldier (Law) walking back home to his beloved meets several interesting characters on the way (Hoffman, Zellweger) but the cake belongs to the firecracker characters Rudy (Zellweger) who teaches the soldier about survival. Rudy's a down-to-earth pioneer woman who's no shrinking violet when it comes to plowing fields or snapping roosters' necks and Zellweger plays Rudy like a charm, delivering a forceful, passionate, even comical performance that cuts through the movie's overall stuffiness.
What can one say. This is no English Patient in texture or theme, but given the interplay of so many wondrous bits that make the whole, it is definitely a number that the exalted Academy will be closely watching. As for you, I recommend this delicious slice of Hollywood though you should probably wipe your mind clean of any expectations based on the book (if you read it.)",1072483200,,1515,4.898832684824903
2015903,5,B0001MDP36,"I am quite surprised by the number of negative reviews of this film.  I found this to be one of the most engaging and moving films of the year, and one of my favourites, along with Kill Bill Volume One and Return of the King.
For me, this film is about struggling through war:  families waiting for loved ones; the political, economical and social repercussions of war; how people try to go on with their lives day to day and build friendships even through such difficult times. It's about how a soldier copes through war (and how he becomes to isolate himself from a war he no longer believes in) and how the woman he loves waits for him, but learns to build a life of her own, even as she awaits his return.  The interesting twist on their relationship is when he left for war, they had only had their first kiss.
The film is extremely well acted by the cast and in particular, Natalie Portman and Philip Seymour Hoffman give strong supporting performances and stand out in a fine ensemble.
The film is also well written and I don't find the dialogue hokey but poetic and it's not corny or groan-inducing like Titanic.  ""Cold Mountain"" is worth seeing.",1072483200,2,1154,4.480952380952381
2015904,4,B0001MDP36,"COLD MOUNTAIN inspired more admiration than affection. And seeing it on Christmas Eve was a downer.
The film begins on July 30, 1864, when Union troops, having tunneled under the Confederate fortifications around Petersburg, VA, blast a giant hole in the stubborn, Southern defensive line with a monster mine. In one of the Civil War's biggest boondoggles, the Battle of the Crater, the Federals managed to transform what was potentially a war-winning assault into complete disaster. Shortly thereafter, Reb soldier Inman (Jude Law) is shot in the throat. While recovering in a field hospital, he receives a letter from his sweetheart, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), back in Cold Mountain, North Carolina. Ada bemoans the hardships that have beset her since her father's death, and beseeches Inman to come home. Sick of war, Inman skedaddles, and begins the dangerous trudge back to Ada's Blue Ridge Mountains farm, about 400 miles as the crow flies. In the meantime, Ida, a lady of genteel upbringing, who can arrange flowers and play the piano but can't boil water or plant a vegetable, is running her patrimony into the ground.
COLD MOUNTAIN isn't the story of two soul mates together, but rather separate tales of two people desperately seeking each other out on the basis of the briefest of pre-war acquaintances - a few words and a single kiss.
Law's Inman is the strong, silent type whose forte is a long-suffering perseverance that perhaps inspires viewer admiration more than sympathy, even as he encounters the varied perils of his trek: Yankee cavalry, Confederate Home Guardsman hunting deserters, a lonely war widow in distress, and treacherous homesteaders.  In the meantime, Kidman's Ada is a bit more animated as she, with the help of Ruby (Renee Zellweger), learns to be a successful farmer and stay gorgeous at the same time. Ruby, an unsophisticated,  proud, self-sufficient, country gal with a smart mouth and an attitude, is perhaps the story's most engaging character. Though the rural, Southern accent sometimes seems a bit over the top, Renee's role is about as distant as one can get from her triumph as bimbo Roxie Hart in last year's Best Picture, CHICAGO.
For me, the most intriguing aspect of COLD MOUNTAIN is in the production notes. The film's director, Anthony Minghella, wanted to film in North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains around Asheville, but logging and modern life have destroyed the primal density of the area's forests. Then, Canada's forests were found not to be an accurate match. Now what? It wasn't until executive producer, Iain Smith, on a walking vacation in Romania, recognized the Carpathian Mountains in Transylvania as resembling an untouched North Carolina. Romania!? In any case, the Battle of the Crater was shot near Bucharest, and Ada's Black Cove Farm and Cold Mountain Town were all outdoor sets constructed in the Transylvanian Alps. And the extras posing as Union and Rebel troops in the opening slaughter were the Romanian Armed Forces. How far we've come from the bad old days of the Cold War!
COLD MOUNTAIN is certainly one of the better films of 2003, but, for me, it lacked the chemistry to be nominated for Best Picture, especially when stacked up against the other exceptional candidates now in the theaters. Only Zellweger, perhaps, may come out of it with a nod for Best Supporting Actor. It's an excellent period piece worth seeing, especially if you're a Civil War buff.",1072396800,5,3441,5.045694200351494
2015905,2,B0001MDP36,"Anyone who remembers when love stories in films really were cathartic, such as in Wuthering Heights (1939), Camille, or even Gone With The Wind, can easily see what a glaring disappointment Cold Mountain is.  Uninspired, self-important, yet full of good intentions from start to finish - Cold Mountain is truly more Titanic than Gone With the Wind.
How could such a talented cast and beautiful production, based on a powerful and acclaimed novel, possibly go wrong?  It's unthinkable that $90 million could be invested in a film and it still would lack creativity and emotional pull. Great movies come from the heart, but in the case of Cold Mountain maybe so much money was invested that Miramax started to see dollar signs as a more alluring alternative than art.  Surely, there is heart in the story, but the film is a terrible misfire. In fact, it misses on almost every level. Kidman and Law are unconvincing as lovers from the start. We never really care about them and, although the concept of a long distance love helping people survive the coldness of war is very moving, the translation on to the screen seems careless.  It doesn't help that the lovers are separated for most of the film, but because there are so many violent, unrelated and unimportant subplots and tacked-on characters, we almost forget about the love story altogether!  Just what is this movie really about?  The plot wanders into so many different directions that by the end of the film, during Law's tragic death scene, we have forgotten what their love represented.  The love story became simply another subplot... Was this an effect of bad editing?
A hollow love story can not drive a 2 1/2 hour film, so we are left to be entertained by supporting characters that actually seem to take over the film - not because they are better actors, but because the Minghella gives the leads nothing to do except look in the distance and look sad.  It gets old after a while.  We want Kidman to be a dynamic character, but thanks to a rotten script she remains the same character throughout the film, and worse still is that this very captivating actress can only bore us with so little to do besides play sympathetic background to Zellwegger.  Just who is the star in Cold Mountain?
Most of the complaints about Kidman's performance in Cold Mountain have to do with her being too beautiful and glamorous. I think we forget how glamorous Greta Garbo was as she was dying of consumption in Camille. No one ever complained about that.
In spite of all its flaws, Cold Mountain does have something to say about war and love, although it is not very profound. War tears people apart. Love is more important than war, and yet at that time in history people were forced to separate and die - sometimes for causes they didn't believe in. The tragedy of this situation would be further heightened and more meaningful if the love story had been sincere and had a degree of modesty and humility. We are led to believe that because this is such an ""important"", expensive film, it is automatically cathartic and artistic. It's all flash and no substance.",1072396800,9,3114,4.718232044198895
2015906,3,B0001MDP36,"Chick flick with blood.

Six words --

Chick flick with lots of blood.

Plot summary for anyone who's recently arrived to the planet:  grievously wounded Confederate soldier deserts and, having been kept alive through many bloody battles by the memory of a preacher's daughter he exchanged a few words and one passionate kiss with before marching off to the slaughter, heads back to her and Cold Mountain, NC, where she, having been kept alive through war privations by the memory of, etc.  He faces many more hardships in uniformly cinematic countrysides and eventually finds her again in a snowstorm.  They spend a cabin night together and a classic Western movie climax takes place, also in snow, the next day.
Five in our family went to see the movie Christmas night -- women loved it, my son and I less impressed.
Other thoughts: the movie is nearly two and a half hours long and feels it; it has many redeeming moments; the opening battle scene is as graphic as the start of Saving Private Ryan; Renee Zellweger is the best thing about it, followed closely by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a lustful preacher, followed closely by the goat lady; it gets the casting of the year award (Jack White of White Stripes as a deserter named Georgia); and if we ever have to endure the privations of a long civil war in harsh surroundings, we'd look a lot worse for it than Nicole Kidman.  Happily Cold Mountain appears never to have lacked for a good hairdresser despite the Civil War hardships.

2015907,4,B0001MDP36,"I would like to preface this review by saying that I have never read the book, so I won't compare the two but only give you my opinion of the movie.
I was completely entranced by the story and of one man's long odyssey back to his home in Cold Mountain after he desserted the Confederate Army.  His remembrances of his true love at home were poignant and her story was the one I found most interesting as she progressed from spoiled and beautiful aristocrat to hard-working farm woman who learns to survive by her own wits.
The movie may have been about 30 minutes too long, several of the scenes made me flinch because of their goriness, and I was initially unhappy to sit this long only to have a sad ending.  But, life isn't always ""happily every after"" and this movie did what it set out to do:  tell a good story, show the horrors of war, and relate the hardships of those who wait at home.
Is it worth seeing?  Definitely! Is it another ""Gone With the Wind""?  Not even close.  But spending 2.5 hours with these memorable characters is definitely worth your time.  While the movie centers on the desserter Inman (Jude Law) and his sweetheart Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) there are many scene-grabbing performances by others, mainly Renee Zellwegger as Ruby Thewes and Kathy Baker as Sally Swanger.

By the end of the movie I was wishing Inman would hurry up and get home so I could go home. Cold Mountain has already received considerable attention by earning several Golden Globe nominations (and no doubt it will get several Oscar nominations too).
