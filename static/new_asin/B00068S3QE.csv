8144750,4,B00068S3QE,"Fun and charming, but the opera theme falters. George's forgotten love of opera doesn't ring true (and his voice doesn't either). The hero and writer is, by the way, Tom Bastounes, not Robert Altman as this page suggests.",1388793600,,221,4.842105263157895
8144751,5,B00068S3QE,I watched it twice as soon as I received it.  Even if you don't like opera you will enjoy the story.  George and his brother and father really are brothers and father and it makes the story so realistic.  I think they were even in the produce business.  This movie was certainly overlooked and under advertised.  Thumbs up from me.,1107993600,8,331,4.45
