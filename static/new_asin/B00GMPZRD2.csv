6087271,4,B00GMPZRD2,"Cal is a great follow up to Shank.  Wayne Virgo is a gem of an actor and I definately look forward to his future projects.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but this one point:  The ending of gay themed movies are becoming cliche and are an insult.  Trying to show ""realism"" does not need these endings.  I'm almost expecting the same ending in any of these movies, and I'm also expecting it to gay characters on tv (for example ""Smash"").  They no longer ""shock"" me.  I hope someday that being gay will no longer be ""tragic"", and our movies should lead the way.",1394236800,4,576,4.229357798165138
6087272,2,B00GMPZRD2,Banal and not too realistic and bad acting. I would definitely say that the performance in this film does not parallel the performance in shank,1394150400,,143,4.76
6087273,4,B00GMPZRD2,"I've waited a long time for this movie to be available.  Not withstanding that, I'd have to say it did not let me down.  There was a very good story and they handled it well.  The only reason I'd not give it a 5 star , is because I enjoyed Shank more. :)  To me, the only real flow between the two movies is Cal's condition in life.",1393372800,2,332,3.838235294117647
6087274,4,B00GMPZRD2,"This is the latest film from Bristol based producer and director Christian Martin. He has chosen to reprise the main character from his first feature length production, Cal. He was last seen as that persona in the rather good `Shank'. Wayne Virgo plays the character again and as ever is very believable. This chapter sees him return from his European travels where he has been working in kitchens as a casual.

He has returned after receiving a post card from him mother's lodger, the alcoholic `Aunty Jane', who has told him his mum is in hospital. He arrives in austerity Britain when Bristol is suffering the same fate as London in the summer riots. He gets involved with a local pimp Ivan (Daniel Brocklebank) when he tries to help one of his boys Jim. Ivan takes Cal's passport and Cal decides to let Jim stay at his mum's house to escape the regular violence of the streets. Their relationship then lurches between friendship and inter dependence as they try to sort out their future and Cal tries to sort out his past.

There is a lot here including sexual exploitation, poverty, dependency, drug abuse, homophobia, violence and relationship issues as well as blatant criminality. Most of the issues are handled sensitively and in an un- clichd way, which is appreciated. There are some plot holes or stretches that some may not be over the moon with; to say what they are would be a plot spoiler. That is done for the purposes of the narrative and is only mildly irksome and actually forgivable.

`Shank' was a welcome breath of independent film fresh air that tackled issues of homosexuality without being an excuse for soft porn and this is very much in the same vein. People are often victims of their circumstances and that is the case here, but what I also like is that those circumstances can be changed for the better with help and a push to make the right choices. Christian Martin has made another very watchable film that raises issues and deals with them in a very human way. Recommended for all indie fans and those who like `gay' themed films to have a bit of thought put into them.",1392508800,11,2104,4.6353887399463805
6087275,4,B00GMPZRD2,"This is the continuation of the life of Cal from the movie Shank. It is much darker in its message, but is fairly well made and most likely just what does occur in many places. This film is set in England but could be here just as easily.",1431043200,,238,3.9791666666666665
6087276,1,B00GMPZRD2,"Not good. The story is kind of boring and at some point very unrealistic. The actors are not very professional. It is disturbingly obvious, that this is a low cost movie. I did not like it.",1424908800,,189,4.277777777777778
6087277,4,B00GMPZRD2,"I don't know what Wayne Virgo's credentials are, but I was impressed by his acting in Shank as well as  in this video. The story line in this film was okay.  I just didn't like the way it ended.  If I I had done to the bad guy what he did, I certainly would not have allowed  him to approach me and my lover.  The ending might suggest that there might be a sequel.  I kinda hope so.  I enjoy looking at this guy.",1416700800,,412,3.8333333333333335
6087278,2,B00GMPZRD2,"Interesting, but the movie was a bit slow to develop.  I have watched a lot of other films in this same category, and for some reason the writers, directors & producers just can't seem to make a mainstream LGBT movie.  Come on, figure it out!",1415836800,,242,4.355555555555555
6087279,5,B00GMPZRD2,"awesome young actor. strong, knows how to be ruthless when needed, but yet caring and sensitive to and for others. love his character and acting.",1415577600,,145,4.84
6087280,4,B00GMPZRD2,"Cruel, but very real, I like it.",1415577600,2,32,3.7142857142857144
6087281,3,B00GMPZRD2,Not near as good as Shank. Very slow movie with sad ending.,1410566400,,59,4.0
6087282,4,B00GMPZRD2,very good,1409097600,,9,4.0
6087283,5,B00GMPZRD2,part two of shank with very sad ending I hope that our hero will recover from this injury and there will be next follow up movie to story of cal this time with very happy end,1409097600,,174,3.861111111111111
6087284,3,B00GMPZRD2,Seen it and forgot it.  Nothing outstanding here.,1407888000,,49,5.125
6087285,5,B00GMPZRD2,"This is a sequel to Shank.  Three years have passed.  Cal (Wayne Virgo) and Olivier have apparently broken up and Cal has been looking for work all over Europe.  He returns to Bristol when his aunt writes to him that his mother is dying of cancer.  He tries but there is no work to be found especially when you have no education or skills. He befriends a rent-boy (hustler) Jason (Tom Payne) from a beating by his pimp known as Ivan. The reason for the beating is that Jason doesn't want to do a particular ""client"" because he smells and tastes like rotten meat.  Ivan's retort is that he doesn't care what he smells or tastes like, he pays and you will perform.  Cal breaks it up but after a scuffle Ivan finds his passport and keeps it.  To get it back Cal has to perform.  There are in a way three stories here.  The riots in Bristol, the situation between Cal and his mother and the situation between Cal, Jason and Ivan.  The last straw comes when Ivan's client wants to watch the both of them beat each other up.  They fake the fight as much as possible or they will be killed.  When over, Ivan informs Cal that since he won, he must now rape Jason.  If you saw Shank, you know what happened to Cal and he refused and after a scuffle got Ivan's gun and wounded him.  They took off with his car and took all the cash.  I won't do a spoiler but the ending could leave it open for a third ""Cal"" film or it could end at number two. The acting in intense and the story is well laid out.  I give it a five",1407715200,4,1505,4.102739726027397
6087286,4,B00GMPZRD2,"Was a good character look into the two main roles,when Cal 1st met to the end where Cal is hurt bad by the (pimp),but they do not show him dying so maybe hope,overall nice small British film.",1404172800,,191,4.1891891891891895
6087287,5,B00GMPZRD2,"I like this directors series from Christian Martin with ""Release"" and not this movie, I would watch ""Release"" first to have a better Idea of the storyline.",1401408000,,155,4.777777777777778
6087288,2,B00GMPZRD2,"After seeing Wayne Virgo in Shank  I expected this movie to be better or as good as Shank and it turned out to be very poor acting, Stupid plot,, and not as sexy as Shank.",1399593600,,171,3.8857142857142857
6087289,4,B00GMPZRD2,"It was very entertaining and had a descent plot, that moved along. For the budget it was one of the better ones in its category.",1397433600,,128,4.16
6087290,5,B00GMPZRD2,"I love this movie. I watched the first movie, Shank. That movie was amazing. So I had to watch this one. I just wish they used Cal's old boyfriend from the first movie with this one.
The story line is amazing. The actors...ACT.

Watch it. You will be happy you did.",1395792000,,265,4.196078431372549
6087291,3,B00GMPZRD2,The entire story line was changed so drastically I could not get back into the main character like I did for the first movie,1395705600,,124,4.208333333333333
6087292,3,B00GMPZRD2,"Shank was so Innovative!!! The camera work was cutting edge, the in your face story line. The Performers especially that character name CAL., well I'm glad to see that, he's still alive a kick'in . The story by Christian Martin should of made the Cal character a little bit wiser, adult like and hook him up, with a older character. Some one more stable then that young veritable lad. Cal left for France and return too U.K. a lost soul..",1395100800,,438,4.4875
6087293,4,B00GMPZRD2,Similar to shank in many ways but this one can hod its owm a movie to make you think in lots of ways.,1394582400,3,101,3.4347826086956523
6087294,5,B00GMPZRD2,"Great Movie. I liked it! Interesting follow up to Shank, which I also recommend seeing before this if you haven't.  The ending leads me to believe another movie may come of this story, I hope!! Wayne Virgo is a great actor! Can't wait to see him in another film!",1394496000,4,262,4.346938775510204

8624803,4,B00GMPZRD2,Why did Amazon permit a scene elimination just in the last month. Is Tom Payne getting sensitive about his earlier work?,1492560000,,120,4.761904761904762

8624805,1,B00GMPZRD2,"This is a shame!  The writers actually spent 2 entire movies, building up the character of Cal, only to have him stabbed by a knife at the end of the second movie, and done away with.  The first movie was Shank.  This movie had potential, and I liked both main characters.  Instead of spending time and money killing off the main character, more time could have been spent on developing the 2 characters as they bonded together.  And perhaps escape at the end, to safer grounds where they could both explore each other more, and their sexuality.  But no, that would be too imaginative.  Sad to say, this is becoming more and more, a typical gay film, where the main character is killed off.  I can't give this movie more than 1 star for that.",1489968000,,742,4.444444444444445
