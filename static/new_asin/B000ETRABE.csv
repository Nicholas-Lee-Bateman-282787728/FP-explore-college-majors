8563738,1,B000ETRABE,"I am an English teacher, and bought three DVDs from this company (at the same time)
There are so many typos and problems with them, that they have become a a lesson in film criticism rather than a source of information about authors, as intended. They are like a boring PowerPoint, elementary and unprofessional.",1399161600,,312,4.796296296296297
8563739,2,B000ETRABE,"For a biography on such a prevalent, well known author I would have thought that the information included in the DVD would be correct.  I am a pre-service teacher and showed this to my class, in the opening picture the dates listed below Poe's picture were 1804-1849.  The video then went on to quote Poe's correct birth year in the opening scene, however I had to explain to my students that I had shown them a video with incorrect information.  I had planned on buying all of the biography video's I would need from this series because they run 30 minutes which is absolutely perfect with a normal high school classroom's schedule.  Needless to say, I won't be buying any more from this series.",1225497600,6,696,4.588709677419355
8563740,1,B000ETRABE,"I am a teacher and bought this dvd to show to my students.  I was amazed at how such an interesting life could have been made so dull.  After we watched the dvd, I challenged my students to write a more interesting biography of Poe.  ""Well, that shouldn't be hard,"" was the immediate respond of one of my students.",1168732800,11,314,4.288135593220339
