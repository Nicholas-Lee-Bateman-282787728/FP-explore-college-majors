7824213,5,6302327814,I fell in love with this movie back in the early 90's and after having it on VHS for years I was glad to see it on DVD so I could add it to my collection. I love the storyline but the chemistry between Eric and Beverly is amazing. Eric is the sexiest conman you'll ever see and would make any woman wanna be taken in by him. If you haven't seen this I suggest you check it out! It's very old but has withstood the test of time. I can't believe this movie is over 20 years old!,1420675200,,476,3.8181818181818183

7824218,3,6302327814,"One of the better films of its genre, ""Lonely Hearts"" follows sad-sack Alma (Beverly D'Angelo) as she falls for con-man Frank (Eric Roberts) and proceeds to become his partner in crime. As the victims add up, Alma becomes more paranoid and Frank more desperate. Much of this film is unintentionally funny - just wait until you see Roberts parading around in a skimpy Speedo that he has no business wearing or watch Sharon Farrell's bad acting as poor duped Louise. Longtime fans of ""The Young snd the Restless"" will recognize Rebecca Street who sports the same pathetic personna she had on the Soap. You will also cheer when she buys it late in the film. As for the leads, Roberts makes a good bad boy but is outshone by D'Angelo, a great actress who never gets her due.",1300060800,2,770,4.586956521739131
