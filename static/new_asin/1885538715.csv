201917,5,1885538715,"Nicely paced, easy to follow, exercise is not difficult but certainly uses the muscles. Would recommend it to older folks also.",932688000,30,127,5.095238095238095
201918,3,1885538715,I wish this video had chapter settings so you could go directly to the exercise you want to do without having to scan through the whole thing.  It's easy to follow and get for this beginner.,1372809600,,190,4.277777777777778
201919,5,1885538715,"I had been practicing along with the VHS copy from the Library.  I got tired of taking it out one week at a time, so I ordered the DVD version.  The DVD has an entirely new set of warm-up exercises done by Ian.  The teaching by Dr Lam is the same as in the original VHS.  It's still the same great Tai Chi intro.",1331769600,,312,3.828125
201920,5,1885538715,The video is excellent in that Dr. Lam shows the correct technique and takes times to isolate parts of the movements in order to help our learning to do it correctly.,1314403200,,166,4.387096774193548
201921,4,1885538715,"This instruction is very thorough and detailed. New movements are shown repeatedly from various angles. The prompts on 'what not to do' within the Tai Chi forms are also very helpful.

Sometimes the instruction seems to go too slowly as you're tempted to perform the forms. But the wait also seems to be worthwhile in that there is a feeling of security which emerges out of the longer instruction into a more grounded knowledge of the form. As well with the longer instruction the forms are better retained for a quicker transition to performing the Tai Chi movements outside of the taped instruction.",1280102400,2,602,4.844660194174757
201922,5,1885538715,This DVD is great for the beginner.  I purchased this to use during an introductory tai chi class.  It was exactly what I needed for home practice.  Very easy to follow.,1167868800,11,169,4.387096774193548
201923,5,1885538715,"I overstand there are a lot of different Taiji videos of many different styles on the market.  most of us can't find good teacher near us and rely solely on these movies to get us through.

Dr Lam is excellent.  I have learned from teacher and video for close to 12 years; Sun style is very strong in it's movements--you will find some Yang style long/short form similarities, but this is different and same.

To complement I suggest Ming's Baguazhang beginning books and videos.  This will help.  Bruce Franztis is in California (may be spelled wrong) and Mantak Chia.

It's easy all you have to do is practice-practice-practice.  Your lifestyle may change some but it is worth the rewiring of ""needs"". Research lineage of nearby teachers-YOU'LL NEED THEM!!!!!!

Taiji is more than just moving slow!

Dr Paul Lam is a great start and if you can, get to a workshop right away conducted by any one I have mentioned.",1126656000,12,914,4.6918238993710695
201924,5,1885538715,"I previewed this CD by renting it before purchase, so there were no surprises.  This CD is perfect for an aging grandmother like me, because it presents a truly beginning level of Tai Chi, and every move was possible for me, even though I am moderately physically handicapped, and need a cane for walking and balance.  Dr. Lam gives a very complete demonstration of each and every move, and a very soothing manner of presentation.  The CD is now a fixed part of my exercise program.",1125187200,41,482,4.5813953488372094
201925,5,1885538715,"I wanted to start learning Tai Chi but since my job involves much travel, I didn't have time to take lessons.  I wouldn't expect any dvd to fill in as a replacement for a live instructor, but I found this dvd was an exellent way to get started.  I am now able to practice all six forms outlined in this dvd.  Dr Paul Lam is very easy to follow.  The nice thing about dvd is that I can instantly pause or rewind to go back and repeat a move as many times as needed. I am able to replay the full demonstion at the end of the dvd on the easy-to-access menu as many times as I need in order to study a different part of forms.  I have found it useful to break the forms down by watching the hand movements then go back and watch the feet and leg movements. I look forward to experiencing the 24 forms video!",1100304000,27,803,3.9627329192546585
201926,2,1885538715,"I've been very excited to try Tai Chi for a while now, but found it frustrating and ultimately impossible to watch Dr. Lam's video. Four key reasons why this didn't work for me:
1) The pacing is all wrong. There is not enough time for me to emulate what the instructors are presenting before they move to something else. It also continually shifts from position to position, and I lose track of where I should be starting from and moving to.
2) There is no philosophy taught behind the movements. I wanted to know a bit about the reason for each of the movements and the philosophy of Tai Chi.
3) These are real-life people who have no stage training. Their talking is stilted and disjointed.
4) The production quality is low. The navigational elements are minimal, and the studio set looks like a junior-high production.
Ultimately, I'm now shopping for another DVD that I can actually watch and from which I can learn something.",1089504000,33,930,4.642424242424243
201927,2,1885538715,"This DVD was a little hard for me to follow. The filming is kind of low budget too.  I would not recommend it for a complete beginner. The title says ""6 Easy Lessons"" but I had a hard time getting through the first ""easy lesson.""",1069113600,10,229,4.088888888888889
201928,5,1885538715,"This is an excellent DVD/tape for starting Tai Chi practice. Dr. Lam does an excellent job at breaking down 6 fundamental forms from the Yang 24 routine. This ""mini-form"" is easy to learn (after you get through the challenge of understanding the ' brush-knee/twist-step' - probably the hardest form on the DVD to grasp). The warm up and Qi-gong finish are very gentle and useful. I highly encourage you to get this title if you are new to the wonderful art of Tai Chi. The other title I recommend for beginners is Terry Dunne's ""Yang Short Form"" - which is more in-depth, and very well produced (which is a rare quality with most Tai Chi videos).",1022630400,28,646,4.577586206896552
201929,5,1885538715,"This is an excellent video for beginners. Dr. Lam gives six essential lessons in Yang style Tai Chi. The moves are presented by Dr. Lam in front and back angles, by his assistant with Dr. Lam commenting on the form and in group form. The moves are repeated several times and are relatively easy to follow for a beginner.
I recommend you get the DVD version if possible. It is so much easier to fast forward or rewind than with a VHS tape. I don't think this video is suitable for intermediate or advanced students and it does not show the complete Yang form, however it is a great introduction for somebody with little or no Tai Chi experience.",1012089600,106,644,4.420168067226891
201930,5,1885538715,"I have reviewed 17 different Tai Chi tapes for beginners, this is by far the best. Dr. Lam presents the best form I have seen. Many other instructors abbreviate the form and movements, trying to make the learning experience easier for the beginner. I found this very confusing, especially when trying to join other groups. I just didn't know what correct form looked like. While my form is not perfect, everyday it improves with the Dr. Lam tapes. The training is provided through warm ups, class demonstration, individual demonstration, and Dr. Lam points out common mistakes made when learning a form. You are given views from the back, side and front. One after another. Learning Tai Chi can be frustrating. Dr. Lam has made it very easy for me.",998784000,69,748,4.8062015503875966
201931,4,1885538715,"I only rated this DVD a 4 star because it is for people who have never taken Tai Chi. The title is a bit misleading. 6 forms aren't given. 6 movements are taught in one form, the simplified Yang form. As a person with intermediate Tai Chi experience I was hoping for expanded forms. This DVD is for a complete novice. As such, it is very good. The movements are given from the front, back and side so novices can easily copy the movements. Especially helpful even for an intermediate student was how the instructor pointed out common mistakes students make in the various movements. The lessons get longer as the student goes through them. The end of the DVD gives references to more advanced videos as well as Tai Chi movements for specific ailments. If you want to learn about Tai Chi without taking a class, this is a very good start. As a reference for more advances students, it is not really worth it.",979689600,233,907,4.469879518072289
201932,1,1885538715,I recently received this DVD after it was on back order for over 3 months and it will not play on my DVD player or on the DVD-ROM drive on my computer.  My computer gives me an error message saying it is not readable.  Do not buy this DVD until the technical problems are resolved!!,978912000,7,282,4.109090909090909
201933,5,1885538715,"Very easy for beginners of tai chi. You'll get alittle confused at first, just follow the  instructor and practice each step before continuing to the next one. Exercises are not hard and the moves are repeated.",975110400,14,210,4.833333333333333
201934,5,1885538715,"I found it very easy to learn. I enjoyed it. It is repeated just enough to be sure that you get it right. If you follow what he says and practice each part before you move onto the next, in no time you will be doing these 6  steps and be ready for more.",948931200,30,253,3.685185185185185
7800870,5,1885538715,"A Very clear and 'hey, I can do this' video.  Most TaiChi and Yoga videos seem to me to be along the theme of 'while standing on your right foot, take your left foot and touch it to your right ear, all the while humming an ancient Chinese meditation song.""  Not this video -- it is for real people who just want to add a little exercise to maintain health.",1511740800,,356,4.071428571428571

more speed on the instruction but, review is good.",1405382400,,112,4.65
7800876,5,1885538715,"Pros - I like Dr. Paul Lam because he is easy to understand.  He talks slow and breaks down each movement, so you understand how to execute each step with the position of your feet and your arm and hand movement as well as where you should be looking.  These are nice and easy exercises that even a Senior Citizen can do.  I like the fact he simplifies a 24 form into only 6 forms.  I have seen the 72 and 108 form versions of several different styles of Tai Chi (Yang, Chen, Wu, etc.) and find Dr. Paul Lam the easier instructor to follow.  I like his calm humble manner of presentation.  He show the back of the student execute the moves so that you can feel like you are in his class following along with the students.  He also shows the other views.
Cons - It would have been nice if he showed the complete form at first with him speaking the names of the movements.  It would also be nice to make each form an exercises for both left and right side as a repeated move looking forwards to help get the muscle memory down.  However, a person can use this video that way and just repeat over each form until they get it down.",1395360000,,1127,4.13302752293578
