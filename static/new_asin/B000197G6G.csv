The Blue Train still operates in South Africa and if you want an experience of a lifetime, watch the video to see what you're missing out on.",1513382400,,278,4.326923076923077

8008464,5,B000197G6G,This was a wonderful video of South Africa highlighting places of interest for all. Included was the ferry to Robben's Island and the coal mines in Cape Town.,1347148800,3,158,4.678571428571429
8008465,5,B000197G6G,"Opening teaser has no narrative and quality wasn't great. But it soon kicks into the program and that was FABULOUS. Really well put together.

The Jo'burg to Cape Town segment was much better, more detailed vs. Cape Town to Port Elizabeth. This segment was still v.enjoyable.

We've seen some of the area and traveled on Rovos Rail, so many fond memories. Sensational value given the price for anyone interested in vacationing in South Africa (would highly recommend, and I am not a SA or work for any tourist co. etc.)",1168300800,10,519,4.7555555555555555
