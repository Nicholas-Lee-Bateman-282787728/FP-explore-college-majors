But one day a man named Mr. Jones comes and visits the orphanage and falls in love with Mary, who is much younger than him. He and Elizabeth take to each other right away and her golden curls earn her the nickname, Curly Top.  But Mary recieves a marrige proposal from a boy her age, and Mr. Jones is jealous and upset.

585794,5,6303095224,"Shirley Temple, whose career as a child star was over by the age of 10 (and who, according to her very good autobiography, reaped a mere $18.00 from it when she asked her father for her reapings upon her second marriage), shines and super-shines in this adorable and heart-rending film.
She and her sister are orphans.  A mysterious benefactor adopts them and they enter a life of luxury, but also a life of love.  Rochelle Hudson is delicately beautiful as the sister, and John Boles is excellent and exceedingly handsome.  I wonder what happened to them both?
""Animal Crackers"" and ""When I Grow Up"" are the top numbers, as well as several sung by Boles and Hudson.  All works out as it should be.
There's just something very moving about this movie.  It's a genuine heart-tugger.
And Shirley is simply a delight!  So glad the camera caught this amazing little girl with such a natural talent shining through her girlhood.",1006646400,18,923,4.7375

Soon enough she is adopted my mr.rich and she is living it large. it's like one of her normal orphan flicks with those cute dimples,smile,singing,and dancing. it's fun to watch her adjust to the new lifestyle complete with all her little toys,bed,and watching her at the beach.

585798,4,6303095224,"Shirley Temple is pint-sized in this film and is fun to watch as she sings some of her number one theme songs ""Animal Crakers in my Soup"" and ""When I Grow Up.""  Shirley plays Elizabeth, an orphan living at an orphange that her sister Mary works at.  Shirley charms one of the trustees and he imediately falls in love with her spunk.  The movie has some entertaining moments that strike us all.  I always laugh when Elizabeth is trying to adjust to her new rich and spoiled life.  All though Shirley seems to be sweet and innocent through the whole movie, she has a selfish point where she says she rather have a pair of roller skates when her gaurdian gives her a pearl necklace.  She saves that little rude comment by putting on a benefit for her orphan friends.  The story line at times is hard to follow, but as always ends happily.  Curly Top is a wonderful movie for young children, but doesn't have a moral or a point.  Shirley of course will dazzle you!",979257600,14,960,4.378531073446328
585799,5,6303095224,"I read that before Shirley Temple went before the cameras, her mother would lean down close and tell her to ""Sparkle.""  Well, she certainly must have listened to her mother, because I feel this is one of Shirley's best movies.  She was definately a polished professional, from the top of her blond ringlet curls to the bottom of her tap shoes, and she knew how to charm an audience.  Her dancing and singing are wonderful, and it's easy to see why she was such a HUGE star in the depression era. Shirley ""sparkles"" throughout this movie, and viewers can only come away pleased after watching this movie.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",973728000,7,622,4.678899082568807

585930,4,6303095224,"This 1935 Fox Film production is one of Shirley Temple's best early films.  It stars John Boles as Edward Blair, a trustee of an orphanage, who adopts Elizabeth Blair (Shirley) and her sister Mary (Rochelle Hudson, who played in several Temple movies).  The British character actor Arthur Treacher plays a butler in the film; he appeared in several other Temple movies, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Princess/dp/B000LC4ZEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Princess</a>, became Merv Griffin's talk-show sidekick in the 1960s, and lent his name to the fish-and-chip fast-food chain of the 1970s, which still exists today, although ARTHUR TREACHER'S FISH AND CHIPS does not have as many locations as it once did.

The film includes such classics as ""Animal Crackers In My Soup,"" which was recently used in a commercial with a completely unnecessary hip-hop remix; the production number ""When I Grow Up,"" where Shirley sings her way through life's various stages, does a brief tap routine dressed as an old lady, then returns as her young self, and taps some more with a jump rope.  Near the end of the film, Shirley tap-dances on the piano to the film's title song, which is brilliant (the dance, not the song).

Overall, this is a very good Temple movie.  While I still prefer the original black-and-white version, the colorized version is better than most colorized films that I have seen.

Bonuses include trailers for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dimples/dp/B000FKPDYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dimples</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heidi/dp/B000FKPDWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heidi</a>, a fake stereo soundtrack, a Spanish-language soundtrack, and subtitles in English and Spanish.

586006,4,6303095224,"This is another solid Shirley Temple film with some wonderful, sweet scenes and lines you certainly wouldn't hear in movies today. For instance: ""It's Sunday. Would you like to go to Sunday School? Ohh, I love Sunday School!""

In addition to the innocence, truly nice characters, decent humor and music, what I appreciated was the lack of screen time of the villain. Many movies have some nasty person giving Shirley a hard time. To me, that's uncomfortable, but in this film the villain gets little screen time. Thus, much of the film features nothing but good, likable people.

That list is headed by pretty Rochelle Hudson as ""Mary Blair"" and charming singer/good guy John Boles as ""Edward Morgan"" and, finally, good old Arthur Treacher as the butler (what else?!), ""Reynolds."".

To be fair, I didn't think the songs were that super, except for Shirley's ""Animal Crackers In My Soup,"" which is a great song. If I recall, at least half the songs in this film were by the adults (two by Boles and one by Rochelle) and, frankly, I'd rather hear little Miss Temple. Boles' numbers and voice are too outdated for today. He has that Rudy Vallee-type 'early 30s voice.

Do not watch this on a colorized VHS version as I did. Shirley's teeth are green and it's distracting. Stick to the black-and-white, especially now that it is available with a good DVD transfer.",1233705600,4,1360,4.774468085106383

586008,4,6303095224,"CURLY TOP is a musical version of Jean Webster's ""Daddy Long Legs"", about a young orphan who is mysteriously sponsored by a never-named benefactor.

Shirley Temple and Rochelle Hudson play Elizabeth and Mary Blair, two orphans who are sponsored by Edward Morgan (John Boles) who uses the alias of 'Hireman Jones'. Complications arise when Edward falls in love with Mary but of course he cannot reveal his true identity. It's up to little Elizabeth to play matchmaker!

Jane Darwell, Esther Dale, Arthur Treacher and Rafaela Ottiano round out the supporting cast. Temple sings the classic ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"". A real charmer.

Twentieth Century-Fox would revisit this property again in 1955's ""Daddy Long Legs"" (starring Fred Astaire and Leslie Caron).",1178323200,6,760,5.264462809917355
586009,4,6303095224,"One of Shirley's earlier films it's also one of her best-- Shirley's curly hair isn't the only thing that is showcased in this film-- this one features more of her favorite songs including that famous""Animal Crackers In My Soup.""

In this Shirley plays an orphan who is the troublemaker and joker of the orphanage. When Bole(""Littlest Rebel"") comes to visit the orphanage as one of the benifactors of the orphanage-- he becomes entranced by ""Curly Top"" who decides to adopt-- he learns that Shirley has an older sister as well so he decides to adopt both of them-- but, under the condition they never know who the rich benefactor is who adopted them making up ""Hireman Jones."" Well, the family slows blends together... Bole and Elizabeth's sister begin to fall in love-- when Elizabeth's sis becomes engaged to someone else it looks like the family will soon be split until a sudden moment of revalation.

Bole does a wonderful job in this Shirley film and you see all that charisma by Bole and Shirley again.  There is not a ton of singing done by Shirley in this flick mainly by her on-screen sister and Bole but, it is still a good movie and features the famous ""Animal Crackers in my Soup.""
