8683219,5,B00OCND3MI,"When the first film in the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, ""The Two Towers."" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?

The answer is yes -- and much more. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is not quite as beautiful and strange as the first movie, but it makes up for this by the even more epic, spellbindingly complex story. Jackson follows different groups as they make their way through Middle-Earth, encountering Anglo-Saxon-style kingdoms, talking trees and the most horrifying of nightmares.

The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.

Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted. And

Though billed as such, ""The Two Towers"" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" when Frodo and Sam went off on a journey by themselves. So now, the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth -- it's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.

While there are some humorous moments still (""Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!"" Pippin wails when a ""tree"" speaks to them), there is a darker tone to the overall story. Aragorn's quest along with his friends involves a seemingly hopeless battle against the evil wizard Saruman, which may involve the deaths of many  innocent, ill-equipped not-soldiers. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.

But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller, more intimate stories, like Gollum's sometimes-chilling struggle between good and evil... which manifests as multiple personalities. And the final battle is capped by a magnificent, tear-jerking speech by Sam about what they are doing (""Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt. Because they were holding on to something"").

And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.

Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust, as Frodo increasingly is worn away by the Ring's evil. And Sean Astin's Sam becomes even more determined to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths -- even as Frodo slips away from him.

But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too. Mortensen shows Aragorn growing into a natural leader who passionately wants to save the people depending on him, and becomes enmeshed in a love triangle with Miranda Otto's strong-willed warrior-maid Eowyn. Bloom and Rhys-Davies also get to change their characters with time, becoming best buddies and competing to see who kills more orcs. And while McKellen isn't quite as much fun as Gandalf 2.0, he still has the wisdom and fire of his previous self -- and as his opposite, Christopher Lee gets to be disdainful and vicious.

""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an epic done right -- it's crammed crammed with so much action, beauty and pathos that it never has time to suffer from ""middle chapter syndrome."" An amazing continuation.",1424995200,,4236,5.002840909090909
