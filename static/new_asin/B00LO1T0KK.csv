6493592,3,B00LO1T0KK,"Decent movie, but come on, what farmer has 1 day supply of meat, salt, and fuel.  Good twist, 3 stars because anyone who survives the first few day of any zpoc has more supplies in the pantry than that.",1442534400,,202,4.17948717948718
6493593,4,B00LO1T0KK,"I love a zombie movie and I thought they did an adequate job with a small budget. Chris Mulkey and his wife are both credible actors and I honestly didn't see the twist coming, until Chris started talking to Bob. You may see what I mean by that. There are so many zombie stinkers out there, this one was so much better. Glad I watched and it's free- so why wouldn't you?",1442448000,,370,4.152777777777778
6493594,1,B00LO1T0KK,"I regret watching it, it was pretty terrible.  The effects were cheap and poorly executed, the acting was horrid, and the plot idea just fell apart by the terrible manner in which it was executed.  6 police officers in bullet proof vests, and they can't kill one guy with a revolver?  They even shoot him and he falls back, and what do they do?  They just presumably stand there and let him kill them all.  I say presumably because it doesn't actually show any of the action, because if they did show it it would be utterly stupid.",1442361600,,531,4.377551020408164

6493596,4,B00LO1T0KK,"Some of the reviews prior to mine might lead some to think they are not genuine because the reviewers are either;  too closely involved or, related in some other way to the movie. However, Collapse, truly is a great zombie flick!  I was pleasantly surprised after watching for just 10 minutes. There's an interesting twist at the end that one might not typically expect to see in a zombie film. The premise is completely original. One viewer felt the story wasn't executed well but I have to disagree. For a lower budget film, I felt the storyline moved along quite well, regardless of a few obvious goofs here and there. It kept my attention from start to finish.
Although Collapse is not anywhere near to being The Walking Dead, the zombie make-up is fairly impressive and the acting by all main characters is commendable, as well.
Currently, (as of 9-16-15) Collapse is available for free for Prime members. However, I have paid much more for zombie flicks in the past that were supposedly higher budget films with well-known actors that didn't even compare. Therefore, if you're a fan of the zombie genre, then, you should absolutely check this one out!",1442361600,38,1157,4.78

6493599,4,B00LO1T0KK,"This movie was made in small town West Branch, Iowa.  I didn't know the story line and was surprised by the twists that the movie takes, which makes it different than most zombie movies.  Definately one not to miss!",1417737600,,215,4.487179487179487
6493600,2,B00LO1T0KK,I lived in West Branch where the movie was made so I was interested in seeing the final product. The movie itself didn't work very well. It had an interesting idea behind it but it was not executed well. Think Shaggy Dog story.,1414540800,4,227,4.3023255813953485

6493604,3,B00LO1T0KK,"Slow-burn story, picks up in the last 3rd. Well-acted, but there are quite a few continuity errors that can't be explained, even with the plot, that I wouldn't have expected considering the overall quality of the film. FX were fairly good as well. It's worth a watch for zombie fans and those that like some twists with their tales.",1498867200,,332,4.6440677966101696
6493605,5,B00LO1T0KK,"Criticism about the audio is correct, but stick with it. I love the zombie genre but it is crowded with garbage. This film was an average zombie flick until the twist ending everyone alludes to. This film now rates as one of my favorite zombie/""spoiler"" thrillers.

6493610,3,B00LO1T0KK,"While this film suffers from what seems like an excruciatingly long setup on the front end, the back half, or back third maybe, moves quickly. At first I thought it was just another zombie movie. I'm glad I stuck with it (well, actually I FF'd it quite a bit). It's a little different than what you expect, and well done overall (except for the excruciatingly slow build up, that is). A lot of good effort and talent for a low budget film.",1491955200,,439,4.365853658536586

6493612,5,B00LO1T0KK,"I love zombie movies.  Anyone who watches the genre must realize that movies like the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead and the later World War Z, and 28 Days Later realize that perfect zombie movies are few and far between.  I am willing to overlook quite a few ""extras"" if the movie has a good enough story and that's ""Collapse"".  There are a lot of things that a bigger budget zombie movie would have--much better special affects and post production, but what this movie lacks in big money flair it makes up with a great story.  [Spoiler Alert!!!]  The story was about as good as a low budget zombie movie gets, and then the last 15 minutes or so the movie takes on a brilliant plot twist which earned that fifth star from me.",1489881600,,727,4.3161764705882355
6493613,1,B00LO1T0KK,"Sadly, the Sound Mixer, Kelly Rooks really messed up the audio in this movie which makes it practically unwatchable. This movie would have at least been decent, however the sound is a biiiiig issue. What were the producers thinking in letting this slide? They should have demanded that Ms. Rooks fix her work. There is no excuse for this movie being produced in it's current state. If I were Kelly, I wouldn't include this movie in my resume nor would I want my name in the credits. In fact, I would never have made these horrible sound levels to begin with, and I'm an amateur.
Kelly Rooks, if you read this, everyone makes mistakes...but I'm sure you knew about these mistakes before the final cut was made. Why did you not fix this before making the final copy?
Whenever I produce videos, I watch my work over and over and over again before uploading that final cut. I make sure the sound levels are at a normal, decent level by adjusting my equipment and also by checking my work on various devices. If you had checked your work, you would have noticed this error right away. NO EXCUSE FOR YOUR FAILURE MS. ROOKS.

6493617,2,B00LO1T0KK,After reading all the good reviews I was set to give this one a chance. The story is probably decent and the cinematography is excellent for a low budget but the acting is horrible. I just couldn't get passed it.

6493629,4,B00LO1T0KK,"Most zombie movies are so predictable with a main hero doing stupid, careless things to endanger all of the ""good"" people. I think that's the first thing that made me appreciate this movie--our hero was mostly careful & would think his plan through before taking action. No sudden, ""oh by the way, let's make him do something stupid so we can throw in a lot more gore"". It was established early on that the main characters had lost a child & were having a hard time financially. The mother was emotionally damaged by the loss so the husband was the strength of the family. When a threat against his loved ones appears, in the form of a zombie apocalypse, he's determined to do everything possible to keep them safe. There were some moments when the story faltered but I was intrigued enough to keep watching. I would have given the review a solid 3 stars except for the ending, which was totally unexpected & brought all of the loose pieces together. That alone bumped it up to almost 5 stars. Out of all the zombie movies I've seen, I think this was one of the better ones.",1483315200,,1074,4.456852791878172

6493634,4,B00LO1T0KK,"I'm not going to do any spoilers but the beginning of the movie seems like a typical zombie movie but keep watching. The only bad thing I can say about this movie was that the sound was awful. The dialogue was very low volume and the music and sound effects were so LOUD. I don't know if they had cheap sound equipment or they were just trying to use cheap scare tactics by getting you to turn up the sound and then BAM, somebody opens a door or revs up an engine. It didn't make me jump. It just made me annoyed. This movie would have been so good if they hadn't resorted to the cheap sound effects.",1482537600,,600,4.093220338983051

There are a few extremely weird points.  On a farm, who keeps dead bodies in the basement instead of burying them in the barn or a plot.  The amount of firearms, especially pistols, the farmer had is ridiculous.  Farmers don't have the excess money.",1475107200,,467,4.609756097560975

Then the zombies started showing up and it was a bit cheesy, but it got more interesting as the time went on.  I'll admit, at times I would zone off because it was kind of slow at times.  This film is worth a watch.  The ending is something I've never seen done before and confusing.  I don't really completely understand what was going on and some of the stupid decisions some people made, but it was a fresh and nice twist.  So really, my only qualms are the lack of explanation and definitive ending and cheese factor.  This movie should definitely be given a try though.

6493678,3,B00LO1T0KK,"The first hour of ""Collapse is really dreadful."" The story meanders pointlessly, the pace is painfully slow without being compelling in any way, the cinematography is almost amateurish, the dialogue is silly, and the acting is uniformly bad, even from actors that better directors got better performances from. Dog-faced character actor Chris Mulkey can't even bring this thing to life. Then at about the 57 minute mark, things get interesting and the last half hour is pretty good, for a low budget zombie film. Mulkey is clearly having fun, and that helps.

A nice twist in the tail you'll likely not foresee, and it's what gets this the extra star above the 3-star zombie flick it would of been.  I'm not gonna spoil it for you, but some mega-studio could cash in on this idea with their big budget and star studded casting.  The cast here, or at least the main cast, do a fine job. Chris Mulkey gives a fine, VERY believable performance.  You zombie lovers should check this one out, especially since it is included FREE on Prime. If you don't have Prime either get it or at least pay the 2.99 or so to rent it.  I forgot the purchase price if you don't have Prime but I have bought MUCH worse movies than this for 10 bucks plus shipping.  You really should watch it, in fact I think I'll watch it again...

She has issues, of course and he is trying desperately to hold on to his farm. His son is facing his own crisis but he is barely noticed by either parent. And the fun soon begins as they are attacked by living dead. His son is bitten and suddenly they are under siege. He tries desperately to keep his wife safe so he barricades the farm house while he calls for help. No answer. It seems the world has collapsed and they might be the only survivors. The attacks on his farm continue unti he makes a desparate trip into town. What follows is nothing short of harrowing for him as he fights to get supplies. What he discovers in town sends him rushing back. WOW! Different type of Zombies and that is the twist in this movie and the answer to the Zombies is revealed in the last 15 min of the movie.  It does appear low budget but it is an older movie and they did well considering the special effects.

I can see many having complaints that the movie is slow. And to a point that is true. However, I think some of those are being far overdramatic. The pacing is slow by more recent standards but it is not in terms of movies in general. So if you enjoy more of the classics the pacing will be fine with you for the most part.

Don't let the low budget scare you off.  I've seen some low budget stinkers and gems...this film was handled pretty well for what they must have had available to put it together.

I suspect that they were trying to put the audience's nerves on edge with the sound -- and it worked.  Every thump of the generator, clink of keys or small everyday motion makes you extremely aware that there may be a living-dead creature listening and stalking the main characters. Scary!

I have sensitive ears, and I still needed to turn up the sound on the player, the computer and my speakers -- all the way up -- in order to hear the dialogue.  This means that my furniture was shaking with the volume of the background noise!

Dialogue was drowned out by background sounds and what would normally be inconsequential sounds of daily life.  The acting was good enough that the dialogue may not have been necessary, but I still prefer to be able to hear it.  That is my only criticism.",1444435200,8,874,4.587096774193548

6493895,5,B00LO1T0KK,"BRILLIANT Absolutely BRILLIANT. Without giving away spoilers the description is wrong... But the movie is like WOW. I was left sitting mouth agape at the ending. It starts out as a campy low budget zombie flick. Ho Hum, oh gee look another reboot of Night Of The Living Dead, mixed with a smattering of Oh Gee, look what happened on Herschel's farm before Rick and Co showed up. Based on the description, setting, and first hour or so, I was expecting a cheap remake of The Crazies. What I got was so much more - like Jacobs Ladder more... I watched it for free on Amazon Prime, but even if you have to pay the rental it is WELL worth it.",1443052800,2,638,4.2809917355371905

A few moments later we see him again, but now the cornfield is brown and withered in autumn.  If you like low-budget movies with these kinds of incredible continuity blunders, you'll love this flick.  I got some good (unintended) laughs out of it.  And by the way, does anyone really still have rotary-dial phones on their kitchen wall these days?  These folks do!",1442707200,,475,4.8875
6493898,1,B00LO1T0KK,"This is really quite awful.  I watched because it had good ratings.  I don't know what those ratings were based on.  The movie is very slow.  And yes, the movie has you believing one thing and doesn't give you any reason not to believe it.  And then a big twist.  Actually, now that I think back on it, the movie is just plain stupid.  But if you like zombie makeup and you enjoy watching them schlump around for a couple of hours you might find yourself in zombie heaven.",1442620800,2,472,4.235955056179775
6493899,5,B00LO1T0KK,"Besides the awesome plot, highly original yet logical (which makes me want to say, ""why didn't I think of that""), there were some very subtle, nice, and sly moments.  There was a problem for me in the sound, particularly when a background sound is mixed hotter than the dialog, which sounds muffled.  This might have been intentional, but, if so, wasn't done well enough for me not to notice.",1442534400,,392,4.666666666666667
6493900,3,B00LO1T0KK,Was not bad. Was not great. Interesting little twist to the genre.  I have to agree with some that the acting was a little stiff but not mad that I watched.,1442534400,5,156,4.032258064516129

8667015,5,B00LO1T0KK,"This is one of these movies to watch from start to finish, but with the awesome acting and story it's well worth the time. You simply have to be patient enough to enjoy a good film, and then see it through.",1515456000,,206,4.048780487804878
8667016,3,B00LO1T0KK,Decent story but the writer should stop writing.  A lot of the lines are kind of dumb.  Zombies all around and the wife wants to play house?  LOL  The acting was below par too but the script was too.  I guess the actors did the best they could with what they had to work with.  I never finished watching this movie.  I couldn't take anymore of it.,1512172800,,347,4.08955223880597

8667018,2,B00LO1T0KK,"Too much pointless fluff at the beginning, slow to get to the real action, acting was hit and miss, contrived story building using people doing and saying things that made no sense or a normal person would not do. The ""twist"" ending also came off as contrived and just fell flat with me.",1509408000,,287,4.433962264150943

8667020,5,B00LO1T0KK,"It starts slow without being boring. Later in the film, it grows more tense. Overall it was watchable, but then there was the twist in the third act that genuinely surprised me. I'm giving it 4.5 stars (which I have to round to something) on a scale for low budget zombie movies, not a scale meant for all movies to be sure. I've drudged my way through a lot of cheap zombie movies looking for a few that are consistently interesting and manage to do something different. It's not easy. This one really did.",1504656000,,507,4.404255319148936

8667022,4,B00LO1T0KK,"Wow, what a great job by Chris Mulkey. This movie needs alot of patience by you. The last 15 minutes will have your jaw dropping, and the set up is brilliant. You have to forgive the whole gun shooting because it looks like a cap gun fight. Yet, I have to say the makeup wasn't to bad for a low budget film. The one cool thing is the fact of Chris  Mulkey and Karen Landry are really husband and wife. The connection the two have comes out in a great way. I honestly can't tell to much because I don't want to ruin it for you, but its a classic Romero zombie that shambles. The one other description I can use is it kind of reminds me a little of the original night of the living dead. A man protecting his family by making his farm house fortified. Seriously, enjoy Chris Mulkey's acting and then ride the tough at times plot. You won't regret the ending. RIP Karen Landry, she died Dec 31, 2015. This movie released September 23, 2014 per imdb yet it has 2011 to.",1501027200,,965,4.160427807486631
