272749,4,6300216632,"Like titillating porn, Mandingo is the kind of film you rent and hope no one you know is looking. Then you hurry home, lower the blinds, make sure  the kids are in bed, then turn on the VCR in anticipation. This film is so  politically incorrect it's worth it on that merit alone! Black and white  stereotypes are played up to the hilt and everybody is running around  ""pleasuring"" any thing that moves. If you don't take it  seriously, you can have loads of fun and laughs watching this one. Snortin'  Norton does a great job as Meade the Mandingo fighting buck. Ol' Jimbo  Mason is superb as the aging hard-line plantation owner who is very strict  and true to the old traditional ways. His son Perry King is a much kinder  and gentler soul without a cruel streak in him like the other characters.  Susan George is great as the sly conniving Southern Belle who is not as  innocent as she seems. Ol' Mr. Bentley from the Jeffersons - Paul Benedict  plays a fine sub-role as Mr. Brambley the slave trader. All in all, let the  liberals cry and whine. Get this film and have a ball with it!",965260800,36,1089,4.385

273294,5,6300216632,"Although this is a difficult movie to watch it is an excellent example of complex themes and excellent character development. Roles  that one assumes to be simple one dimensional develop into characters that are complex and  multi - faceted.  Most importantly Mandingo illustrates that evil destroys victims and perpetrators.  The social, moral, economic, educational and political devastation of slavery  was so complete that the  United States took more than 200 years to abolish slavery and another 100 years to pass civil rights reform. The fight to correct these wrongs continues to this day as demonstrated by disparity in education, income, economic development, and legislation. As a nation we can quickly find injustice  and human rights violations in other nations.  But the mirror in which we gaze doesn't always reflect the evil and injustice that surround us daily.  Well worth watching and discussing..",1457913600,8,916,5.394366197183099

They say you should never throw stones, when you live in a glass house, well this movie shows what happens when those who throw stones live in glass houses. The rocks they throw, often shatter their own foundations.

In this movie, the hatred and hypocrisy of the plantation owner against an entire race of people, is what destroyed his own family. The movie is full of fights, seperation of families, incest and rape. It's a raw, precurser to 12 years a slave.

One day we will get to a point where all people, not just non-whites are judged by their own actions and not just grouped with an entire race, sex, culture or religion of people.",1447372800,2,723,4.553846153846154

273507,5,6300216632,"I just watched this film.  I was in my teens when it first came out and have never seen it until now.  I've watched a lot of slavery movies in my time but this is by far the most raw, dark, and disturbing of them all.  In my opinion, it makes Twelve Years a Slave look rather tame.  It was something that I wanted to turn away from but I kept watching.  I really feel that the movie correctly channeled many of the unspeakable horrors of slave life.  Some may argue that the storylines were not factual or too sensationalized but you just know that the truth of what really happened during those times is far more than our collective minds can handle.  Only the souls of the dead slaves and slaves owners really know and carried those horrors with them.  In a book and movie like this, you feel that they did come through and speak from the grave.  It seems that I watched the edited version but I saw enough.  The movie brings up so many many deeply repressed attitudes and feelings about race, sexuality, religion, sexism,  that are played out everyday here and now.  A tough unflinching look at what humans beings are capable of doing to each other.",1442534400,,1152,4.382075471698113

Realistic truths about the carnal evils creating rigid brutal plantation conditions and peculiar body challenges black males suffered with oversterotypes and lies about darker skin pigments. ""Toughening"" the skin with hot waters, and hog-tied whippings are demonstrated in this film. I can think of no other films outside of ""Twelve Years A Slave"" that demonstrates the quality of good actors and actresses with such difficult topic and role demands. However, if you like the truth of historical dramas such as ""Twelve Years A Slave"", Mandingo is like ""the other"" hidden discourses about males who were enslaved and 'prized' for gamblin fighting matches.

I remembered one part when at the funeral of the Masters wife that the Mandingo's boiled bones were dumped out on her grave. This movie was short of that and did not show that part. All through it I remembered things that were cut out of scenes. So movie was not as complete with all scenes full and it was filmed. Even some of the love making scenes were cut out or cut short. Would have liked it if all the movie was left uncut as it was filmed as I wanted it as a collectors item. I did see the movie when it first came out and this one fail a bit short of the full length of original movie.

She makes him do it because she's jealous that her husband loves a slave woman more then her. Her husband finds out about this so he kills the newborn baby, then gives his wife poison and then boils the slave in a big vat of boiling water. I would say the husband was a bit pissed off about the whole situation. But finally getting to see it over 40's later, a bit of a let down.",1419984000,,701,3.978723404255319

If you go in it with a sense that the injustice portrayed in the movie did in fact occur then like myself, you will not find it funny but instead sad. If you think that it was all a figment of someones imagination then, I'd question why you're even watching this movie. It will keep your eyes fixed on the screen. I found the dialogue a bit hard to follow at times. A lot of the racial slurs and generel terminology I had never heard before. There is a lot of frontal female nudity (only once does a male genitalia appear on screen) and lots of bare bottoms shown. So if nudity bothers you a lot, then i suggest you skip this one. However I would not go as far as calling this a porno as some others have. Only one actual sex scene is shown in the movie and by todays standard, it was tame. I myself found the fight scene harder to watch. All in all it was very engaging. Not something I'd watch over and over again.",1408579200,2,1091,4.102803738317757

Denial of cruelty could not stand up to this scathing portrayal of the institution of Slavery in Antebellum South as contained in this film!  Most reactions in the white world at the time the film was released and after for many years; focused on the sexuality vividly shown,  and completely missed the point.  This is a brilliant and incisive film and highlights many of the reasons that Slavery had to be abolished and even Lincoln's own party didn't support his abhorrence to it!  Lincoln learned, seeing it up close and personal, as a boy;  his repugnance to it  in Kentucky.  The movie ""Lincoln"" proves that opposition to the idea of slavery was not overwhelming and the 13th Amendment abolishing the legal position of it only passed by two votes in the House after languishing there for a whole year after it passed the Senate.  Further, eight or nine gutless wonders in the House abstained on the final vote.  One was from OHIO and that proves what I have learned about the State, since moving here 14 years ago!  OH is just a much in favor of treating Black Men and Women as chattel and is not the glorious keeper of the flames of freedom like they like to portray themselves.  Prejudice and Discrimination still exist in the North and are more pernicious and disguised than now exists in many Southern States.

However, the story line would be good in a book...meaning the relationships re: master, ""bed wench"" slaves and ""white lady"" tolerance of concubinage. Well, it was so bad it was good I guess.

Slavery held both the slaves and their owners captive to a world of inhuman psychological distress. The climatic ending of this movie illustrates the dreadful consequences of living in a world where people are allowed to ""own"" other human beings.",1388188800,,549,5.1

You can see the similarities with Django and it is better than many more well-known slave dramas. Quite advanced for its time.  Other than the standard whipping scene, most slave pics during the 70s did not show real brutality like Mandingo (I skip the fight scene.

274676,3,6300216632,"I rented this movie to watch a ""dirty South"" style gladiatorial film.  Little did I know I was stumbling upon a soft-core porn film, even though it wasn't stated as such. Pretty much let me sum the movie up for you in a nutshell.  A horny young owner of a rundown plantation (probably because he thinks more about bedding his slaves than he does upkeep of the grounds) decides to marry his (go ahead and guess) cousin.  He gets all mad and flustered because she's not a virgin (despite the fact that he mates with any woman classified as a wench, aka blacks and French prostitutes) and neglects her badly.  Meanwhile, of course, he is having a passionate affair with his favorite and now only bed slave.  OK, so one day he chances upon this big, built Mandingo slave.  The slave, he learns, can fight very well.  He puts this guy to use in winning some money in pitted fights.  Well, while off on a trip for some reason I forget, the insanely jealous and neglected wife decides to coerce the big, bad Mandingo into being a sexual partner, partially out of private revenge and partially out of wanting to get some action which she wasn't getting from her husband because he is too absorbed in his own affair. OK, well she finds out she is pregnant (now keep in mind she has had ""relations"" albeit not many with her husband) and you can tell she's uncertain who's the daddy.  Well, nine months later we find out... and the father is... the Mandingo!  I'll leave the rest for you to watch if you care to.

The story would have been much better if they didn't emphasize so much on sex.  Quite frankly, if this was done better, they could have had a really cool feature film that was like Roots meets Gladiator.  Then again- if you want erotic film with artistic value- this actually was quite good in an S&M kind of way- I feel like this movie put 50 Shades of Grey to absolute wimpering shame in that realm... just fyi.",1381795200,2,1916,4.409090909090909

274680,3,6300216632,"I think this film was made by a someone who really didn't have much idea of what plantation life was like in the real South. There is enough white trash southern acting and talking to satisfy the voyeuristic interests of those who are looking for that sort of thing. I just found it sad and lewd.

Being from the South and also the direct descendant of plantation owners, I saw a lot that was wrong with this movie. I, of course, cannot say that such things did not happen. I will say that had they happened with frequency that such corruption and decadent behavior would have made the Civil War entirely unnecessary. The South would have crumbled under the weight of it's own evil and debauchery.

My first complaint is the language of the film. I grew up among genteel southern folk who would never have spoken as the characters in this film were portrayed. If they were trying to portray southern white trash, then they certainly did. White trash did not occupy southern plantation houses at least not in the normal course of events.

My second complaint is the way in which the character Hamilton disposed of his wife.  When he first learned that his wife was not a virgin, he would have taken her back to her family and the marriage annulled or left her in New Orleans to find her own way back.  On learning that she had been with a black man, he would have been within his rights to have shot her immediately, no questions asked.(in that time period.) Any well-bred Southern white man would know that, but obviously the author did not or he was aiming for a more prurient interest.

I am not defending slavery, it was an abomination and it was evil. But what I DO know is that slaves were viewed as property no different than an expensive tractor. Most of the time very valuable property.  According to the film, Hamilton paid $7,000 for this slave. That would be comparable today to a $500,000 combine. No planter in his right mind is going to go out and take a tire iron to $500,000 combine because he's mad at his wife. It doesn't make economic sense. Planters were business men after all. They were out to make money and slaves were a part of that equation. Ok, so you say, Hamilton was really, really stupid. It could be, maybe, but very doubtful.

The story had too many holes in it to be entertaining and the ending just too, too gross. Somebody needs to take that white trash author out behind the barn and take a hickory stick to his backside.",1380758400,3,2458,4.470982142857143

274867,3,6300216632,"Mandingo (1975) was directed by Richard Fleischer for Paramount Pictures.

In 1840s Louisiana, spoiled squire, Hammond Maxwell (Perry King), is happy to just canoodle 24/7 with his father's young female slaves but widower Warren Maxwell (James Mason) wants his son to marry and start rebuilding Falconhurst, their dilapidated plantation. Hammond ventures to New Orleans to marry a cousin but along the way purchases a lovely female slave, Ellen (Brenda Sykes), and Mede (Ken Norton), a muscular Mandingo slave, with hopes of turning him into a prizefighter. On his wedding night, Hammond discovers his bride, Blanche (Susan George), is not a virgin and henceforth directs all of his affection towards Ellen. Mede becomes the toast of the plantation after he wins a vicious, no-holds bout. Jealous of Ellen and desperate for some canoodling herself, Blanche orders Mede to satisfy her sexual needs. Blanche becomes pregnant and when the mixed-race infant is born all hell breaks out at Falconhurst. Hammond had been (very) slightly sympathetic to the slaves' condition until he learns he has been cuckolded by Mede.

This Southern-gothic look at American slavery condenses the very worst prejudices and behaviors of slaveholders into the film's two hours. Many have called Mandingo exploitative but no one should expect subtlety in a Dino De Laurentiis production. The scene where Hammond drops to his knees beside his bed to say his evening prayers over an awaiting young female slave, Dite (19-year-old Debbi Morgan in her second credited role), while the camera lingers salaciously over her nude body virtually defines exploitation. We get it, Fleischer. Slave owners were blazing hypocrites. But in scenes like this one and others the director seems to think he must rub the audience's face in it. The bottom line is any fictional reenactment of slavery can't come close to depicting the actual misery and terror inflicted on human beings. Outside of the sex and violence this film has an ""ABC Movie of the Week"" feel to it with a subpar script by eccentric screenwriter, Norman Wexler, and some especially unconvincing acting from famous boxer, Ken Norton, whose blank-faced, non-emotive portrayal is as stiff as a two-by-four. In addition, Mason's exaggerated Southern drawl is barely understandable. Lovely Susan George gives it her best shot as the frustrated, whiny, heavy-drinking Blanche.

While this film suggests slaves from the West African Mandinka tribe were somewhat rare, they were actually well-represented in the slave population. Film director Quentin Tarantino admitted he drew quite a bit of inspiration for his Django In Chains from Mandingo, which he has cited as one of his favorite movies. However, historians state that the Mandinka death matches featured in both films are a myth.

Mandingo was filmed mainly in Geismar, Lousiana where the historic Ashland-Belle Helene plantation served as the setting for Falconhurst. Additional scenes were shot at the Houmas House Plantation in Burnside, Louisiana and in the French Quarter in New Orleans.",1369872000,,3071,5.338842975206612

James Mason's acting was authentic as usual, Ken Norton was used properly in not having alot of speaking parts and just showing the athletic build in the movie. Perry King, was quite believable as the sympathetic slave owner...the movie was raw, harsh and in your face which I appreciated. I don't think U can really make a movie about slavery that everyone will agree with as a good film considering the history and brutality of the subject.

275038,4,6300216632,"Quentin Tarantino has cited ""Mandingo"" as one of only two instances that major studio made a full-on, gigantic, big-budget exploitation movie, the other being ""Showgirls"". With Dino De Laurentiis producing and highly regarded director, Richard Fleischer at the helm, this was certainly no low-budget sex/blaxploitation film like many that were made in the 70s after the Hayes Code was relaxed. It certainly shows plenty of skin and the sex scenes are rather explicit, but based on my personal memory, it is a fairly faithful rendering of the novel by Kyle Onstott. And the nudity and sex are not as gratuitous as in most exploitation films of the 70s. That is because this film is intended to show black slavery in the Antebellum South in all its sordid depravity. It certainly does that quite well! As much as a third of the indigenous Mandinka people of West Africa (called Mandingo in the South) were enslaved through capture in war and shipped to the Americas. They were highly sought after by slave owners for their strength and stamina...and some were used in gaming as fighters as shown in this film. While the film was big-budget, the only A-list actor featured is James Mason and he was nearing the end of a long and distinguished career. Mason plays the patriarch of a slave-breeding plantation family in Louisiana...probably the worst sort of plantation where slaves were bred like cattle and the slave owners were active participants in the breeding. The rest of the cast, including Susan George, Perry King and boxer, Ken Norton as the Mandingo, Mede, perform well too. One of the best of the exploitation films; highly recommended for fans of that genre and for those who can bear to watch a realistic expose of slavery as it really was.",1361145600,7,1751,4.879194630872483

It titillates you with sex and sadism.  It's the first film I have ever seen to show full male frontal nudity.  To me, that made it more accurate. Perry King was great as the master's son. It shows the brutality of how dehumanizing slavery really was.  I feel it was probably pretty accurate as well.

 The quality of the print is not optimal, but it is adequate to enjoy the movie.  If it is ever re-done, I will buy it again, because I love this movie.  It takes a lot of money to restore and digitally remaster an old film nearly 40 years old.

After going to many museums about plantation life and slavery, I am pretty sure that this movie summed up the horrors of slavery for everyone involved. Hypocritical owners and the slaves themselves just trying to get by. We know there were cruel owners, some that were kind, some that were crazy, some that were psychopaths and some like these in this movie whose place in life where no better than others they commanded. Slaves that were freedom fighters, snitches, good, bad, innocent and not so innocent were trying to have one more day to either freedom or just some comfort.

No need to gloss over those times. It was a nasty time in our history that was as raw as this film. That is why I applaud the rawness. Everything in it, I have read about or seen at a museum.

275216,3,6300216632,"The first time I heard of Mandingo was it's opening on the big screen in Philadelphia in 1975. I didn't see it then, nor in the decades since. But I kept hearing references on how bad it was, how down right evil.

The best remarks I heard was ""Did anyone read the script before the filming began?""

So I found a copy at a garage sale a few years back and watched it. One part Dixieland-ish porn with full frontal nudity for men and women, one part National Geographic documentary for the sets, I was stunned. So was my wife. The VHS copy disappeared from the film shelf when I wasn't looking.

Besides the absolutely creepy plantation, perfect for the equally creepy James Mason, Mandingo goes where no film dares go by lifting the curtain between the races in the 1840 pre-Civil War south.

As a historian I take the script with huge chunks of salt, not just a grain. As a film fan I'm amazed by the details. The walls of the big house look smeared by decades of soot and fly specks. You can almost smell the lack of hygiene in the masters of that domain.

After visiting the Rural Life Museum in Baton Rouge, Louisiana I had to see Mandingo again. For authenticity, the slave quarters looked just like the ones on the museum grounds.

Race relations in the movie are supported by the history of Thomas Jefferson and his slaves, and further enhanced by the Charles Sumner speech where he called a South Carolina Senator a 'pimp for slavery' saying slave owners use their slave women for sex. That argument got Sumner a horrific caning on the Senate floor, a beating similar to that given characters in Mandingo.

For all of the repugnant aspects of the movie, I find myself glad to have seen it and at the same time repulsed. Few movies have that power over viewers.",1353888000,,1767,4.468944099378882
275217,4,6300216632,"As a long time fan of the Falconhurst books by Kyle Onstott and others, I had read the book long before watching the film. As the saying goes, the film was not as good as the book but it actually stayed fairly true to the course. All of the richness of the book could never be displayed on film but it came very close.

For those who can not bear to watch racial inequality it is best to avoid this film. While the slaves were poor in material wealth, the whites in the movie were morally destitute. Was this the way it actually was back in the day?  As one watches the movie, I am sure this question is asked many times.

James Mason steals the show in my book. Susan George was passable in her leading role. As a B list actress, she may have been pegged out to the max trying to protray a sleazy southern belle.

As forementioned, I am a Falconhurst fan and certainly wish they would make movies of all 14 of the books.

275218,4,6300216632,"What would you do if you had complete power and absolute control of another human being?  That was a question asked in the movie ""Caligula"".  What would you do if you had the power of life and death? I believe the question to be relevant here as well.

Basically, this movie is about black slaves getting caught up in the games that the white slave owners are playing amongst themselves.  More often than not, the slaves end up victims and their lot in life follow the fortunes (and misfortunes) of their masters.  The story takes place in the South, on a plantation owned by Warren Maxwell.

The distinguished actor, James Mason, plays Warren Maxwell.  A young Perry King plays his son, Hammond.  British actress Susan George plays Blanche.  And boxer Ken Norton plays the role of Mede, the Mandingo.

Getting on in years, Maxwell wants his only son (Hammond) to provide him a grandson so they can keep the family line going as well as to have someone in line to inherit the plantation.  The younger Maxwell goes to town and picks up a woman to be his wife.  The audience knows right away that the woman, Blanche, is just trouble waiting to happen.  Hammond and Blanche agree to marry.  On their first bedding, Hammond realizes that Blanche is not a virgin.  Blanche throws a tantrum and insists that she was until that night.  While in town, Hammond also purchases a couple of slaves.  A woman ""bed wench"" and a muscular male slave called Mede.  Eventually, he takes them all back to his father's plantation.

Hammond and Mede develop a fondness for one another.  Meanwhile, Blanche has taken to the bottle and spends most of her days in a drunken stupor.  Hammond trains Mede for the fighting ring.  In return, Mede shows his loyalty by giving it all he has in the fighting ring for his master Hammond.  The elderly Hammond spends his days trying to transfer the pain of his gout and his arthritis to his house boy.  Meanwhile, Hammond avoids his wife and instead beds his black women, leaving Blanche unfulfilled.  Now, as you can see, this is a recipe for trouble.  And trouble does indeed come to the plantation.

This is a good movie.  It was made during the middle of the 1970s, when blaxploitation was a very popular film genre.  This is blaxploitation, not ""Roots""!  And the humiliation and the degradation of black slaves are depicted in a way that is very excessive and over-the-top.  Sexual exploitation is always a present part of the theme and the plot.  The sleaze factor is there.  I am reminded of the movie ""Caligula"".  There is a sequel called ""Drum"".  Although it is not a direct sequel in terms of plot, the character of Hammond Maxwell returns (this time played by Warren Oates).",1353024000,,2702,4.6405919661733614

275251,4,6300216632,"There are a lot of reviews for the film, ""Mandingo"", here at Amazon that were based upon reviews for VHS releases, or for censored versions released on DVD from overseas.

I want to state for the record, that this DVD rerelease of ""Mandingo"", which was made by Paramount/Legend Films Home Video in 2008, is the OFFICIAL, ORIGINAL, UNCUT release of this film.  The cover photo has a large closeup photo of Ken Norton on the cover, with the hand of Susan George(or a hand model)resting on the top of his chest and neck in a caress, with a background photo of three African-American female slaves standing next to a wagon wheel.

The DVD is made in DVD Video format, and has menu pages to go from scene to scene. It is shown in 1:78 Ratio Widescreen.  It is 2 hours and 7 minutes long, and is close-captioned for the hearing impaired. Those are the only features available on the DVD, but at least it is not a DVD-R disc.

I went straight to the bedroom scene with Ken Norton and Susan George.  It is all here, complete and uncut, and as hot and erotic as I remember it to be.  Very sensual, in a Gothic sort of way, which was typical of the early-to-mid 19th Century time period.  Don't expect a great digital remastering of the film.  The original negative of the film is lost, according to Internet reports that I have read.  Paramount/Legend Films Home Video found the only uncut copy of the film in the world over in Europe, and used it to make this DVD.  The colors are somewhat faded and worn, and at the end of the bedroom scene between Norton and George, the viewer can no longer see Ken Norton's full body in the dim light of the camera shot.

It would be nice if Paramount Pictures would digitally remaster ""Mandingo"", and show it in the way it was meant to be seen.  But because of the enduring controversy that the subject matter of the film provokes in the general public here in America, it may never take place.  For all that we know, there may NEVER be a rerelease of ""Mandingo"" in any video format once this OFFICIAL DVD rerelease is no longer in print.  Don't take the chance of missing out on owning a copy of one of the most important American films of the 20th Century.  Don't wait.

275256,5,6300216632,"In 1975 I was raised in California and saw the movie in Meridian, Ms. There was a lot of anger, shock and discomfort in the theater. I wonder if there will ever be a good time to show something like this?

I read the ""Falconhurst"" books that chronicled the lives of the Mawell family and their slaves lives. If you can deal with the fact that the Maxwell's in the books weren't neccessarily cruel but oblivious to their slaves as humans and the lengths to which said slaves had to go to have more of a life than just carrying water from the well, being ""pestered"" by the master and his friends etc. You might like to check them out.

I was at times a little uncomfortable reading the books as a woman of color but I did enjoy the vivid explaination of how people lived, the mindset of the various classes, the caste system, and the slaves ability to adapt to their situation without really giving up their hearts and thoughts one hundred percent.

The saga is like a John Jakes saga. The books are: MANDINGO, DRUM, FALCONHURTS FANCY, MASTER OF FALCONHURST, MISTRESS OF FALCONHURST, FLIGHT TO FALCONHURST, HEIR TO FALCONHURST, THE MUSTEE, AND GOLDEN SUN.

My comment isn't meant to offend anyone. I neither endorse the saga I do believe that this is someone else's take on slavery and a considerable amount of guestimation since the two authors didn't live back in the 1850's through the 1870's.

Graduated from high school in 79 and even in the 70s there was a lot of hatered from white people toward black people, and yes there was a lot of hatered from black people toward white people.  What the white people did to black people in the slave days was truely disgraceful, cold blooded and cold hearted.  There wasn't very many white christians around in those days, even though they claimed to be christians.  I have always felt that is why the South lost the war, God knew it was wrong for people  to be treated in such low-down tacky discraceful ways.  I was born and raised in Nashville, TN. and I am white.  I also had black boyfriends in the 70s.  It was a little hard for both myself and boyfriends back then.  But still not as bad as one might think.  Today I am married have been married to the same guy for 28 years and he is truely a blessing from God, and he is black.  If I had come up during the slave days he and I both would have been whipped, tired and feathered, as you will see with this movie you will understand why I said that.  It is truely the good the bad and the ugly.  I thank God everyday for letting the South loose the war.

Yes there is GRAPHIC violence,nudity(expected) and a look at slavery that would have been condemned(the love scene mistress and slave)which might NOT have been the norm but not unlikely to have happened  especially if you read J.A.

Much of the events that happen in this film you will not find in history books, but you can bet stuff that happened in this film was all too common back then when plantation owners saw slaves as their possessions.

275307,5,6300216632,"If you are watching ""Mandingo"" in 2011 or later you might not understand it. Back in the day some white folks kept black folks as slaves in the south. All the white folks was bad and mean, sometimes even to other white folks. Most of that foolish white meanness was over women. You'd be mad too if you had to go around dressing like Colonel Sanders and the only air conditioning you had was the kind they have in this movie. Black kids fanning you with huge feathers while you're eating at the dinner table and speakin' like you ain't had nary a lot of schoolin'.

Back in these slavery days it was really a taboo thing for white women to be having black men as boyfriends and having their babies. Just like in 1975 when the movie was first shown in the theaters.

For some reason, this ain't a joke now, an old white man places his old wrinkled up white feets on nekkid black boy's tummy because that's supposed to make them feets feel better. Some southern doctor told him a black boy's tummy was as good as a Mexican's to make your feets feel better! I ain't lyin' now. Hush up and get a copy of this movie.

Mandingo was the title of a book that they based this movie on. There is no sense in reading the book since it is now in video form. Mandingo is a high priced slave that the white women want. The Mandingo is played in the movie by Ken Norton. He's a real life boxer that beat Muhammad Ali and his son played in the NFL.

Ken Norton is great in this movie. He has one of the best movie fight scenes I've ever seen with a former wrestler named Earl Maynard. So you've got two legit tough guys going at it and they are making it look legit with biting and blood! The deal was, slave owners are fighting their slaves and betting on them. Fight scenes are better when using real athletes as actors.

Although he's doesn't say much and was actually made fun of in an early Mandingo SNL skit starring O.J. Simpson you should come away with a new found acting respect for Ken Norton. He's not an actor in the classic sense and he might not have even make the grade school play cut but this role was his.

""Roots"" is a great T.V. mini-series to watch. This ain't Roots at all.

Then end of this movie is very intense. Here's some of the ingredients: a gun, white people, black people, a pitchfork, a big huge boiling pot of something over a fire, screaming men and women.

If you are a fan of this steamy and very interesting movie directed by a true legend Richard Fleischer, and already have the DVD... don't bother to upgrade.",1287446400,7,430,4.5
275332,4,6300216632,"I like 70's blaxploitation films (most of them)and I had not seen Mandingo.  I bought this on a blind buy from elsewhere at a can't miss price!

First, this film is really soft porn.  Most people spend their time without clothes on and that includes little kids!  I noticed the woman (Vickie?) from All My Children in here and as I suspected, her body is looking right!  One woman who looks like Angela Bassett looked good, but was thin.  You see full frontal nudity in this film including a penis! Boy, who knew that you had to whore yourself out for acting roles?

Anyway, this film is of course about slavery and the main white character loves having sex with black women and is not really attracted to white women.  In this film and maybe in that era in Louisiana, men seemed to only want to have sex with virgins.  I can't say that I have, so a virgin does not get me excited.  Obviously the blacks are slaves and the whites (even foreign ones of German and French persuasion) are slave owners.

The one thing that I have noticed in this film which rings true for today is, that the blacks cannot make a move or think for themselves as the white must always suggest what they should think or do.  If a slave was told to clean the yard and he was heading toward a rake, the white man would tell him to get a rake to clean the yard.  I am sure that many blacks today know that feeling.  If you are in a university or on the job, before you can DO and you already know what to do, the white is suggesting to you what you should do as if you cannot think for yourself. When I saw these actions in Mandingo, I thought that the master/slave relationship still exists, at least in the minds of whites.  You see where ever you go, whites always love to tell blacks what to do or how to do it.  It is one of the reasons whites are made quarterbacks in the NFL and why blacks were mainly barred from that position for the longest time.  They need the white man to direct the black man and not for the black man to direct the white man.  It is a mental game.  This is why Michael Vick caught so much hell for the over some dogs, but Ben Rotheleissberger just got suspended.

Another master/slave paradigm in Mandingo is the forcing the slaves to fight each other so that the white man collects the money, but the black man is the one damaged.  They taught the slaves to kill each other, but not their masters.  Sound familiar?  Yes, it is the same as boxing!  The only difference is, the boxers get paid NOW, but since many of them are dimwits, they end up broke and the white man took ALL of the money again.  This is why they say that education is the key to freedom.  This was realistic and relates to today's world.

All in all, this film was pretty realistic even though I am sure that real slavery was worse.  Unlike other films about the black plight where whites - or some whites, end up looking like the savior, all whites showed that they were on the same team in the end!  The guy who liked the black slave women still treated them like slaves and made them work.  He even told them that they were slaves even when they started to get too close. This film successfully showed the slave who's education level was very low and the only thing that he knew was being a slave and to serve.  This is why they did not want slaves to read.  Once slaves got educated and could read, then they could where they came from, who they were and how they ended up in the predicament.  A good, obedient slaves was the dumb one raised to serve and not think about why only he and other blacks are doing all of the work!  It's kind of like blacks in customer service jobs, whether it is at a fast food place (illegals took over those jobs) or retail, blacks make up the bulk of the labor and whites make up the bulk of the management.  In other words, blacks get stuck making chump change while whites make the only decent money that can be made in retail - management money.  The only thing that has changed from slave times to now is that blacks are not called slaves and they think that they are free because they get a pay check instead of a whip!  When you look a minimum wage and how much companies make in a week, blacks are still slaves.

Now, as for the Blu Ray quality, it is not in surround sound, but the sound was clear and appeared to be taken from an original source.  The picture quality during the opening credits were like ""Every Which Way but Loose,"" but then turned into a presentable BD.  For the most part it was sharp and somewhat clean, but I could not help but feeling as if they had not remastered it, but simply gave it a transfer.  The best part is, it is not bad, but I was left thinking that it could have been better.  There is low noise in the picture.  Colors are not vibrant but the credits were.  Overall, it is not a bad picture quality and if this is as good as it can get, then it is not bad.  The cover just sucks.

I would recommend this picture to anyone wanted an idea of the torture, exploitation and frustrations of slavery was like.  This was no one-time holocaust from another people in another land, this was 400 plus 100+ years of slavery, segregation, discrimination, exploitation, abuse,domestic TERRORISM and humiliation in this land, by these people, AND - the very people who love to tell the world about a holocaust that was short without long-lasting effects, but they were some of the main ones involved in the black exploitation during slave times and of course until now.  Just look at the producers and or director of most blaxploitation films and get back to me!  My favorite line in the film is when the guy is about to get lynched and he says: ""After you lynch me, you can kiss my a**!""  Lol!  That sums it all up.",1287014400,6,5762,4.254829806807727

The degradation factor is reflective of the exploitive glee pervasive in old epics about the Roman persecution of Christians.  Richard Kline's cinematography goes out of its way to complement the assortment of distorted pathologies on hand; and the dying Falconhurst Plantation is a terrific set piece for typifying Southern decay.

275349,4,6300216632,"This movie, based on the pulp fiction ante-bellum novels of Lance Horner, is a unique variation on the blaxploitation flims of the 1970s. Its depiction of slavery, complete with whippings and sexual exploitation, are de rigeur plays to the ""black rage"" of that genre, with more than a little sexual titillation thrown into their depiction. The appearance of some reputable actors here, fairly good production values and Ken Norton's embodiment of a powerfully virile black manhood  makes this particular expression of that genre a cut above most blaxploitation films of the time. There is also a fair amount of nudity, including unsimulated scenes in which Norton and lead actor Perry King are visibly aroused while being fondled through their clothes by women. Or loin-cloth in the case of Norton.

This movie expressed a unique moment in American film-making when mainstream movies in the 70s (this one is from Warner Brothers) were sexually and socially more daring. This was partly a legacy of the 1960s, but largely because of the growing influence of porn films. The impact of an exploding porn film industry made depiction of nudity and sexual themes, including fetishes like whippings,  much rawer and unmediated than anything before or now in mainstream cinema. This film version of ""Mandingo"" is a good documentation of that moment.

Those interested in this film should be warned that there are some censored versions being sold, in keeping with our own times in which plenty of nudity, sex and violence is fine, so long as its scripted, air-brushed and simulated in just the right ways.

  There are a number of ""one way"" sex scenes as Plantation Women are brutalized by their masters. There are some great actors and Boxer Ken Norton does a most plausible job in the title role. Hammond Maxwell(Perry King), at first,seems somewhat sympathetic to the plight of the slave, but then falls in line with all the other Slave Holders in using African American Women for their own sexual gratification. He gratifies his father's( James Mason) desire by obtaining a Mandingo(Ken Norton)at the slave market. Norton gets into a fight and is victorious over another slave. King immediately starts training Norton to fight. Norton fights a ""bloody"" match in which he is severly injured, but so what- he made a lot of money for King!
  James Mason, demanding an heir has encourged his son to marry a nearby Plantion Owners daughter. The daughter(Susan George) portends to be the proper virgin, but actually has been in an incestious relationship with her brother. To further complicate things, King has had a pleasureable sexual relationship with one of his future father in law's slaves. King purchases this slave to take home. King both takes the slave home and marries the daughter.
  Finding out about both the lack of virginity and the incestious relationship, King neglects his new wife and continues to see the slave lady. George, seeking revenge, turns her attentions to Norton. The plot thickens!

275354,5,6300216632,"This film is still controversial and shocking some 34 yrs after it's first debut in theatres!
I remember hearing my parents discuss this film in shocked disbelief after they'd gone
to see it back in 1975!---And the first season of SNL did a hilarious sketch parody of it
which is still among their more legendary and cutting edge sketches of all time! (-:
The subject of slavery itself is unbelievable enough, and that white people of means
in the antebellum south deemed/justified it as god's natural order for over 300 yrs
is mind-boggling, but yes, it exsisted, and untold atrocities rivaling or perhaps even
eclipsing those of WW2 Nazi Germany abounded during this time! (It was just never chronicled!)
This film was the first to address it from the sexual dynamics;
The handsome, lustful and virile slavemaster's son, played wonderfully
by the absolutely gorgeous (when he was young!) Perry King, who is so spoiled
on having his pleasure with the most desirable of the black female slaves that
he & his father owns, that he doesn't desire nor know how to even relate to a white woman,
who the antebellum man placed on such a high & patronizing moral pedestal that the idea of
her being a sexual being was considered almost a sacrilage!
So it was deemed as a rite of passage for white fathers and sons of that time
to explore all of their most depraved, animalistic, strident and hedonistic flights
of the white male sexual imagination with their black slave women on a regular basis!
This was expected, accepted and not frowned upon by ""polite"" white society
(male or female) of that time, so they indulged themselves freely while keeping up appearances
and having their white wives and children, cultivating wealth, and maintaining the warped social
order of the pre-civil war south.

Perry King's character, Hammond, has a special predilection for the virgin
slave women who had yet to feel the passion of another man's embrace,
so that he could properly ""break them in"" to his liking!
There is an almost ritualistic approach to this practice and he has a sense of
entitlement about it, while of course, the black slave women have no say in the matter.
He is a very contridictory character...one who embodies the times he lives in perfectly.
He has unusual compassion and tolerance for his slaves, yet exacts brutal reprimand on them
when they fall outside of lines of the strict white supremist master/slave social order!
He beds black women every night, yet refrains from kissing, caressing, showing real affection
for them, only ""utilizing them"" for his pleasure...because to show affection with them in bed
is to consider their humanity, and that would fly in the face of all of the warped double
standard-laden idiotic backwards logic of his times! He makes ONE exception though, later in the film.
There is so much contridiction, chicainery (an old word from that time, that meant
trickery, double-dealing, etc.), racial taboos, sexuality, brutality, etc., in this
very unique film, that it amazes me that it got past the censors of that time!
Even though it was the mid 70's & in the middle of the sexual revolution, this was rad stuff!

Without going scene by scene and giving away the movie for people who have yet to see it,
it just suffices to say that this is not the typical slavery era drama in the tradition
of ROOTS, QUEEN, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MISS JANE PITTMAN, etc.!!--This goes much deeper
and shows a much more realistic & seedier side of slavery and the antebellum
southern social morays that many may find offensive to their modern PC sensibilities!
But this film was very well done for it's time, had a great cast of credible actors,
the production and direction of Dino De Laurentis and others, as well as being well written.
There is much more going on here than a white slave owner who buys a prized
mandingo fighting stud (played by pro boxer Ken Norton) to breed with his best
female slaves like cattle, to produce a stable of super-stud fighting slaves which
he plans to sell and exploit like fighting chickens...there are the dynamics of interracial
love & sex, the explosion of the myth of the prystine lilly white princess (played by Susan George)
with no sense of her own sexuality, incest issues, and horrible racial folkloric beliefs
that have to be seen to believed!--The father of Perry King's character is played by veteran actor,
the late James Mason, who is a downright despicable racist who does/ says some terrible things
in this film, but like I said before, that's how it was then and what alot of whites believed!
You can't look at it through 2009 sensibilities, you have to go back there to the 1830's.
I first saw this movie for myself on cable late one night when I was in my teens,
then I never saw or heard of it again until it was released to DVD in 2008.
This is still an amazing piece of film history that packs a punch and pushes
buttons of racial/sexual/social dynamics which are still struggled with today!
Everybody who I have shown this movie to has been moved in every kind of way,
on every level you can imagine!-- Check it out for sure!",1258243200,5,5105,4.741282339707537

The bad news is that this movie is so far removed from present life for people of both colors that it's character and subject matter are not taught,learned or sought after today. This was an excellent period piece movie that could not even be made today because of political correctness. Instead of using the ""N-word"", can you imagine James Mason's character at the end calling the slave with the gun a stupid ""African American?"" This movie has character, depth, realism, while entertaining as much as any other major movie. I just saw this movie for the first time this year, 2009. All of the actors and actresses captured the fear, hatred, resentment, lust and ignorance as much as  slavery  could be captured on film. Ken Norton was excellent as Mede, not just another athlete ,with no acting skills(Hulk Hogan) thrown into a movie. He did a good job. Susan George evoked all kinds of emotions from every end of the spectrum, from the neglected wife, to slave abuser and baby killer to seducer of Mede to spoiled daughter, to victim of a racist husband , shamed by the fact that the first child of his wife is by a big, black, slave. Perry King did an excellent job and the son of rich plantation owner, played by James Mason's character. Just when the subject matter became secondary, and one might start to like King's character, since he is the most likable of the racist , violent slave owners in the movie, we are educated once again by the nature of slavery and the viciousness that defined the era.

For all  who have an uneducated automatic reaction based solely on the word ""slavery"", I would recommend this movie. Or , if one just want to be entertained and educated by a movie unafraid to tell the truth,using graphic language, torture and sexual cohersion and violence of the day, this is the period piece movie for you.

Well-acted and intelligent, and Susan George is amazing in an unappreciated role. She's supposed to seem shrill and unbearable as a Southern gentlewoman, it's a role her character is clearly not comfortable with and she plays it with a bug-eyed sense of fear, as if desperately trying to pass for genteel in a family that only values surface and is stuck in a mire of double standards and evil. I was devastated for three weeks after watching it. You can understand critics at the time trying to weasel out of the moral obligation the film imposes by branding it sleazy trash.

275377,5,6300216632,"Part Harold Robbins and part Euripedes, this film has brutal depictions of slavery, abhorrent language, and extraordinary cinematography by Richard Kline. The imagery of Falconhurst, the huge but decrepit plantation of a cruel and vicious man (James Mason in a strange and brilliant performance) is fantastic; with peeling paint and filthy mosquito nets, winding staircases of gleaming wood, dark steamy rooms, and lush exteriors with drooping wisteria. The score by Maurice Jarre also adds much to the atmosphere, with Muddy Waters singing ""Born in This Time"".

Perry King is excellent as Mason's son, broken in body, weak in spirit, knowing what is right and often doing what is wrong; as his wife, Susan George is appropriately annoying and trashy, and as his ""wench"", Brenda Sykes is lovely. Heavyweight boxer Ken Norton, who won over Mohammed Ali (and broke his jaw) in 1973, made his impressive screen debut as Mede the Mandingo.

This film is a mass of contradictions, which is probably what keeps one glued to the screen, and makes it memorable years after seeing it. It is manipulative yet unpredictable, gratuitous and raw but thought-provoking; some of it might be absurd, but many of the situations shown did happen.

275400,4,6300216632,"I am a huge fan of science fiction and horror.  However, nothing prepared me for the treachery and sorrow of ""Mandingo.""  Not since ""Planet of the Apes"" have I seen a movie where humans are treated worse than animals; they are brutalized, degraded, and murdered because their skin color is different.

  Since the beginning of time, humans have been enslaved by other humans.  This occurred often in war when the vanquished were forced into slavery by their conquerors.  However, America was not at war with Africa.  Slavery was committed for greed and lust.

  I've seen countless movies about vampire families, but none of these families were as perverted, cruel and twisted as the Maxwells of Falconhurst Plantation.  Slaves are bred like cattle - their babies are separated from them and sold like puppies; they are forced to fight like dogs and roosters and they are forced to have sex with their owners; and they are denied education.  Worst of all, they are not allowed to read the Bible; their owners fear that they might discover that they have souls and begin believing they are just as good as white people.

  In ""The Color Purple,"" Celie (Whoopie Goldberg)is a brutalized young black woman.  In ""Mandingo,"" we have Meade (heavy weight boxer Ken Norton) who is victimized by the society in which he is unfortunate to live.  His sexually depraved master, Hammond Maxwell (Perry King), can not be faithful to his wife and is constantly sleeping with his slaves.  Maxwell has always dreamed of owning a Mandingo; he buys Mede and trains him to be a fighter.  Mede must fight other slaves to the death or be killed himself.  He must mate with his sister, Big Pearl, or die.  He must make love to his master's alcoholic wife Blanche (Susan George) or die.  Poor Mede doesn't have much of a choice about anything.  I guess that is what it means to be enslaved.

  Mede is trapped in a bizarre world, more bizarre and dangerous than that of ""The Planet of the Apes,"" ""Logan's Run,"" or ""Soylent Green.""  A world in which Mede has no hope.  Tragedy will prevent him from seeing a future in which slavery has ended.

1)  To those who found the film offensive - well, I guess you found Shindler's List offensive.  There's nudity, torture, excessive emotions, etc. Everything depicted in this film was historically accurate and has been recorded in varying instances. If you found it offensive, then go back to watching LOVE STORY or reruns of FRIENDS.

2)  The movie is fascinating. Yes, it's melodrama - well, sometimes life IS a melodrama.  Anyone see LA VIE EN ROSE, the Academy Award winning best foreign film on the life of of singer Edith Piaf?  Or NOW VOYAGER? THE COLOR PURPLE? The great films of the 50s by Douglas Sirk? This does not make a film bad by any means.

3) The film is an accurate depiction of various aspects of American slavery. Period. Miscegenation DID happen - ever read about Thomas Jefferson? Slave markets. They existed & were run as shown in the film (read some of the diaries from the time period).  When someone complains about this movie - it's because it's NOT cheap whitewash the way GONE WITH THE WIND was. And the movie does show some of the strange ways that southerners - the plantation owners, thought & acted in their time.

The film is important in that it was groundbreaking in the way it showed slavery in the south. If it's not your cup of tea, that's one thing. Fine. Hey - my friend hates Ingmar Bergman movies, but are they really boring, nothing-happening films? You cannot knock a movie just because you don't like the subject matter. One has to review something fairly, within its genre. I have an aunt who hates gangster movies and thinks THE GODFATHER is cheap soap opera junk. Is she giving a valid review of the film?

4)  The film is a serious look at a lurid subject.  And it is not unintentionally funny or humorous.  Those who laughed at this motion picture are not to be taken seriously - they're just here at Amazon trashing movies, taking cheap shots.  One cannot look at a serious depiction of slavery (with actual behaviors and events based on historical research) and find it funny. If they do, well - consider the source and disregard whatever they have to say. Their life view is obviously skewed.

In closing, this film is well paced, has fine acting, fascinating characters, terrific photography, and a story that is totally engrossing.

One thing to know - MANDINGO wasn't sanitized for a delicate audience like many of the complainers here would like. It's a look at the deep south as it was. If you want to see what GONE WITH THE WIND was too racist & cowardly to say, then I recommend viewing this motion picture.",1206921600,6,2816,4.620481927710843
275442,4,6300216632,"It seems fitting to headline my review of 'Mandingo' with the last words of the dying Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's 'Heart Of Darkness', because it also aptly sums up my response not only to the unfortunately accurate nature of the numerous atrocities depicted in this generally effective and unflinching film, but also my response to a significant number of the other customer reviews.

I have to say I was truly shocked at how many viewers responded with derisive amusement, laughter, and even a weird kind of delight to this frankly brutal, harsh, and, yes, often lurid look at the brutal, harsh, and often lurid reality that was the evil institution known as ""slavery"" -- a system which dehumanized and degraded everything it touched, and which nearly destroyed a nation. (Much as the Nazis' ""Final Solution"" would do a century later, only with more systematic efficiency, and with global repercussions.)

And this is to be regarded as a fitting subject for MIRTH? Well, perhaps if you lack a modicum of compassion, or even a rudimentary frame of reference with regard to black history. Admit it -- if this film had been about the Holocaust and had depicted the torture and gassing of Jews instead of the beating and lynching of slaves you would NOT have laughed, would you? At least I HOPE you wouldn't!

Face it, this is a particular chapter of history that is simply too close to home and too uncomfortable for many white Americans (which I, also, with some degree of shame, admit to being) to fully acknowledge, much less stomach. Damn right this film is inflammatory, politically incorrect, offensive and salacious. It HAD to be if was to pretend to any level of accuracy with regard to even a semi-objective portrayal of slavery. And my particular star-rating has more to do with the films' refreshingly crude and repugnant portrayal of slavery rather than as an assessment of the film as a particular work of cinematic art.

Yes, I found a number of things to quibble with in 'Mandingo', both in terms of certain stylistic and technical details, as well as some of the  writing and acting, though there is much to be admired there as well. But those aspects are really beside my point.

Basically, 'Mandingo' is what it is, admire it or loathe it. 'Song Of The South' or 'Gone With The Wind' it definitely ain't. But you can seek out those films too, if you're craving a cozier cinematic version of the pre and Civil-War-Era South to soothe your sensitive consciences.

Or, perhaps, in addition to 'Mandingo', you might consider seeing 'The Autobiography Of Miss Jane Pittman', 'Roots', 'Amistad', 'Beloved' or 'Manderlay'. That is IF you're willing to wake up and smell that good ol' plantation-grown coffee!",1206835200,51,2715,4.863636363636363

275469,5,6300216632,"Veteran actor James Mason's ""straight man Maxwell"" to Ken Norton's ""boiled man Mede"" is a highlight of one of the most entertaining comedies of the past few decades.

I couldn't stop laughing as Mason sternly looked to Agamemnon (Richard Ward) and said: ""Put that gun down you looney black bastard!""  - after which the slave shot him in the chest and killed him.

Susan George, playing ""Blanche Maxwell"" makes a dubious appearence as a horny ""southern belle"" of sorts, but with a face as homely as hers is, her portrayal is only for the credulous. Were I her husband, I would have went for the wenches too.

The various beatings, fistfights and lynchings only serve to make the viewer laugh even harder, with a piece de resistance climax - Susan George being poisoned with strychnine by her loving husband Hammond (Perry King) after she drops a mulatto sired by ""boiled man"" Ken Norton.

In addition, the ""boiled man Mede"" scene is most entertaining, Perry King first shooting Ken Norton in the chest, after which he tumbles into a vat of boiling water and is scalded to death.

This movie shows how DEVILISH slave owners actually were and how they DEHUMANIZED African-Americans, while using them to spur their lavish lifestyles. It also delves into the MORAL DEPRAVITY of slavery (which is something that white Americans have long tried to distance themselves from). This movie pulls no punches as black slaves are used as SEX OBJECTS and must submit to their evil white master's (and mistress') debaucherous desires. This movie is EXTREMELY HISTORICALLY ACCURATE and deals with slavery in a very matter of fact manner. It is true that devilish, DEVIANT white slave owners (Thomas Jefferson for one) RAPED slaves and had INNUMERABLE offspring! We can't let this truth be forgotten! Furthermore, to get revenge on these white male SEXUAL PREDATORS, quite often their scorned white wives turned to the affections of WELL-ENDOWED black male slaves to even the score and to fulfill their carnal fantasies. Mandingo (hate it or love it) deals with these adult, and perhaps, taboo themes. It is understandable why some people who are ignorant of the TRUTHS of slavery, are in DENIAL or have GUILTY CONSCIOUS concerning these matters would be infuriated by this FIVE STAR GEM.",1114905600,24,1343,5.109090909090909

As for the subject matter, I still maintain that Mandingo, along with ROOTS, is the most acurate portrayal of what went on in Southern plantations. Having a story with this as the backdrop does not make fun of slavery any more than M*A*S*H makes fun of the horrors of war. On the contrary, it can make for a more dramatic and emotionally involving story.

I contend that Manidingo is a compelling drama. You want to see what happens to these characters. When the old plantation owner gets his at the end, I cheered.

As far as laughs go, nothing compares with Susan George's lustful, boozy belle. And if you can't enjoy the campy fun of watching Oscar nominee James Mason acting alongside boxer Ken Norton, then you're incapable of appreciating true comedy.

275496,4,6300216632,"Part Harold Robbins and part Euripedes, this film has brutal depictions of slavery, abhorrent language, and extraordinary cinematography by Richard Kline.
The imagery of Falconhurst, the huge but decrepit plantation of a cruel and vicious man (James Mason in a strange and brilliant performance) is fantastic; with peeling paint and filthy mosquito nets, winding staircases of gleaming wood, dark steamy rooms, and lush exteriors with drooping wisteria.
The score by Maurice Jarre also adds much to the atmosphere, with Muddy Waters singing ""Born in This Time"".
Perry King is excellent as Mason's son, broken in body, weak in spirit, knowing what is right and often doing what is wrong; as his wife, Susan George is appropriately annoying and trashy, and as his ""wench"", Brenda Sykes is lovely. Heavyweight boxer Ken Norton, who won over Mohammed Ali (and broke his jaw) in 1973, made his impressive screen debut as Mede the Mandingo.
This film is a mass of contradictions, which is probably what keeps one glued to the screen. It is manipulative yet unpredictable, gratuitous and raw but thought-provoking; some of it might be absurd, but many of the situations shown did happen.
With all the brutality, nudity, incest, and most of all, the repellent language, this is not a film for the young, or anyone squeamish about violence.

Mandingo is the film of the novel that supposedly blew the lid of what the old South was like. Hmmmm, I don't know how true to life it actually is and I don't care to speculate, but this film offers up some real nasty scenes that involve posses, boiling water, slave fights, hangings etc etc. Some of the acting is pretty good (eg. James Mason in particular, Brenda Sykes and the head slave -who's been in a hell of a lot of things, but I can't recall his name), but some of it is pretty average (eg. Ken Norton and Susan George who just plays the same pouty b**** that she plays in alot of films but in older clothes), but the average actors were no doubt limited by the roles they were given and not by their own talent.
This film on one hand is really awful and as another reviewer said you almost feel guilty for watching it, but at the same time it is amazing that a big studio spent the money on it and overall it pulls the viewer into its warped world for the sheer spectacle.
