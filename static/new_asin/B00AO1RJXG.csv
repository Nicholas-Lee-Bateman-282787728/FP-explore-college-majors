Following this political farce is great..",1365811200,12,139,5.363636363636363
5462544,4,B00AO1RJXG,"This series reminds one of ""Yes, Minister"": The skeptical approach to British politics, the fine and consistently humorous script, a low budget, and excellent acting and directing.  This is a keeper, another of those splendid series featuring Penelope Keith.  If ""No Job For a Lady"" isn't as good as ""The Norman Conquests,"" well, what is? In short, it's well worth the price.",1363996800,21,375,5.032258064516129
5462545,4,B00AO1RJXG,"A comic look at the inside workings of the House of Commons. Jean Price MP (Penelope Keith- `To the Manor Born') takes on the men's world and last-decade 20th century issues. Many are largely yet unsettled in the real political world; on both sides of the Atlantic. Political and intellectual humor well written by Alex Shearer using much sarcasm and one-liners. Delightful for political interest viewers who can also laugh at themselves. No issue left without mud tossing.

MP Labour Whip (Garfield Morgan) and MP Ken (Paul Young), an office mate, are both funny in all 18 episodes. Antagonist MP Eagan (George Baker- ""Ruth Rendell Mysteries"") is a Tory pain in the `baps' for 12 episodes, then replaced by MP Monkton (Michael Cochrane.) Cochrane turns from this 1992 Tory MP bad guy to a Vicar in ""Downton Abbey"" two decades later.

5462546,4,B00AO1RJXG,DVD gives the point of view in serious styles and sometimes laughing style! More on the serious side. Nevertheless I know of Penelope Keith from the comedy Good Neighbors! She does a good job at being a MP (member of parliament) one of the few women who were at the time this film was made and came out!,1468627200,2,303,4.241379310344827
5462547,5,B00AO1RJXG,"In the 80's Penelope Keith was the queen of British comedy.  Her quintessential and long running show was To the Manor Born and nothing comes close to touching that show.  But No Job for a Lady is a good but short lived showcase of her talents.

Penelope plays a newly elected female MP trying to do her job but having politics get in the way - sometimes is party politics but often it is gender politics (i.e. a woman in a man dominated world).  But anyone who has ever seen a Penelope Keith BritCom know that she may not always win her battles but her oppenent never escapes unscathed.

If you are a fan of Yes Minister/Prime Minister, then this is a must.  Although it would be better to watch this first because YM is what this could have become. (The next level of politcal frustration.)  If you haven't seen YM/YPM (the original version not the remake) then buy both.  Even Americans can understand the British politics!",1467849600,2,926,4.502994011976048

5462550,4,B00AO1RJXG,"I bought this series because it stars Penelope Keith (as Jean Price MP).  I found it enjoyable up to a point.  Being American and having absolutely no understanding of UK Parliament, most of the humor is mystifying.  Apparently, they have quite a few political parties, none of which are explained.  At one point, Jean Price identifies herself as a socialist.  Most of the series takes place in confined areas like her office, hallways, and the kitchen in her home.  Jean Price goes from being newly elected and slightly bewildered to a sanctimonious sneak by series three.  Her scruples lag.  In one episode, she helps a woman lose her job then callously tells her to go out and find another one.  In another episode, it is suggested that she helped a woman kidnap her child.  In yet another episode, she makes a bad bet then expects her husband to fulfill the terms of said bet by washing windows in his off hours.  When she abruptly became high and mighty, the series ceased to be as humorous.  And then it just ended with a whimper.",1453593600,3,1036,4.601092896174864

5462552,4,B00AO1RJXG,"It's Penelope Keith, so of course it's good.  It does help to have some knowledge of British politics and particularly, Britain in the 1980s, in order to understand it.

5462578,5,B00AO1RJXG,"Like most Americans, I first saw Penelope Keith in ""Good Neighbors,"" as it was known here. Then I saw her excellent work in ""To The Manor Born,"" and became a devoted fan. Although ""No Job for a Lady"" aired only briefly on our PBS station, it was enough for me to become hooked on another Penelope Keith vehicle. It was wonderful to see the scenes I sill remembered now showing on my own TV. This show is very similar to ""Paul Eddington's Yes, Minister,"" although her character is a back bencher and not a cabinet minister. However, the political satire of the inner workings of Parliament are non-the-less funny and informative. If you enjoy Penelope Keith, you will enjoy ""No Job for a Lady.""",1373241600,10,693,4.596774193548387

She again plays a strong, dryly humored woman who carries off zingers with naturalness and panache. The only disappointment is that the series she's in don't run longer! Maybe that's British TV-2 or 3 seasons and out. Selfishly, I wish she were still doing TV series but I suspect she's doing more theatre and enjoying her gardening.",1370217600,,417,5.057971014492754

5462583,4,B00AO1RJXG,"Like another reviewer, I bought this because I loved Penelope Keith in To the Manor Born and wanted to see anything she had done.  Well, it is certainly NOT in the category of To the Manor Born, but it is fairly intelligent and entertaining in a low key sort of way.  At Amazon's very reasonabe price, I'd say it was worth it.  I even think that it might be better on a later, second or third viewing.  As another reviewer also said, its production values, while fine, are quiet limited.  In fact, it relies so heavily on dialogue, which Keith and the cast execute very well,  that it could almost have been a radio series.  So, if the price strikes you as not terribly much, I'd say give it a try: don't set your expectations too high and you very well might enjoy watching the wonderful Penelope Keith and the rest of her cast.  Oh, and as for the laugh track, it is rather insistent, especially in the beginning episodes, but I was able to get used to it and I think it actually gets a tad better as it goes along.",1369008000,8,1017,4.260416666666667
5462584,3,B00AO1RJXG,"A weak and improbabe plot and setting.  It shows the smallest House
of Commons that ever existed, to save money on set and cast.
Occasionally witty dialogue doesn't save it.  I loved  Penelope Keith
in To the Manor Born, which is why I tried this series, but it was a major
disappointment.  Hopefully Penelope can find a better vehicle for her
talents in the future.  I will try again if she does.",1368316800,,397,4.458333333333333

8555097,4,B00AO1RJXG,"Happened upon this series via AcornTv. It is a British sitcom that aired on ITV between 1990 and 1992. It stars Penelope Keith, who plays Jean Price, a newly elected Labour MEmber of Parliament, who is trying to figure out her role.  It was written by Alex Shearer, and directed and produced by John Howard Davies. This series is quite humorous that also reflects the everyday battles of life.

Jean Price, is the MP for an unknown inner-city constituency, and her life in the House of Commons. She is married to Geoff Price, and as well being an MP she has to try and look after her house and children. We never see the interior of the Commons, and most of the scenes take place in her small, crowded, shared office. Her Scottish colleague Ken Miller, is a good friend and mentor. However, what we learn is the manner in which politicians get around their jobs. As we know most of the politicians in the US use much of their time getting re-elected. That seems to be one of the primary jobs of these MP's, however Jean Price wants to actually work for her constituency. There are other characters who come and go, and most of the episodes have a real issue that is interspersed with humor. If course, Jean is one of the first female MP's, so she must deal with the inherent sexism, and she does it with great aplomb.
