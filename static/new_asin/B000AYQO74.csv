8081035,2,B000AYQO74,"This is a movie that leaves one stupefied, not because it is exceptionally well-made, poorly made or profound but because it is such an uneven film. ""Bollywood and Vine"" stars Jamey Schrick as Bhuvan Bannerji, a Hollywood tour bus operator who becomes fascinated with his long-time favorite but now forgotten and out-of-work starlet, Delilah Leigh (Skye Aubrey) whose house he has discovered. She lives there with her son Devin (played by J.R. Jones) who poses as her and Bannerji approaches the two to offer a script he wrote under the false pretense that Devin is Delilah. While Devin does look convincingly like a lady, why would Bannerji not question why an older woman looks so young? Anyway, the film is intriguing early on as this premise leads to some awkward scenarios where Bannerji and Devin as Delilah tango, but soon the plot includes many sudden and unnecessary subplots involving multiple kidnapping, the disposing of a dead body and blackmail, among other shenanigans.

The film is all over the map as it is not really funny enough to be a comedy, there is little romance except for the very end of the film, it does not have enough parody to be a parody of anything, and, with only one gay character, it is not really ""gay interest"" and it is difficult to classify this as anything. I am not against films that blend genres so long as they are entertaining or at least get some of the themes right.

The three main characters are interesting (even if they act at times ridiculously and not in a fun way) and the acting is fairly good among the trio (particularly J.R. Jones), but a lot of the minor characters are poorly portrayed. The low budget really shines through and it is difficult to believe a lot of the sets and scenes; the amateur film-making often takes you out of the story. The sad thing is this might have been a much more enjoyable farce if the ending was not so silly and extreme or if it had some slapstick or even just a higher budget.

This film might hold your interest and even entertain you quite a bit if you do not mind a lot of odd, unrealistic turn of events and silliness. The build-up in the beginning half of the film as well as the performances of J.R. Jones, Jamey Schrick and, to an extent, Skye Aubrey make this an amateur film worth considering, but this indie film that-could-but-really-couldn't is not essential viewing for anyone.",1342310400,,2385,4.633569739952718
8081036,2,B000AYQO74,"then here is a little VERY low budget film that barely reaches the tolerable level for most, but for those who delight in over-the-top spoofs, it may just appeal.  One wonders just how these 'Bollywood' spoofs escape criticism from the fine film makers that come out of India (Deepa Mehta's trilogy, for example), but then most of them are made in India and are actually throwbacks to the heyday cinematic musicals of the 1940s.

BOLLYWOOD AND VINE follows the contrived idea that a young Indian wannabe film maker named Bhuvan Bannerji (Jamey Schrick) drives a tourist bus into the Hollywood Hills where lives an old actress of horror movies, one Delilah Leigh (Skye Aubrey, the only professional actress in the film and one whose credits date back to 1967) who lives on poverty's edge with her gay son Devin (J.R. Jones). Delilah hasn't worked in years, lives as a recluse, and when Bhuvan mistakes Devin (in complete drag) for Delilah he leaves a script at her doorstep.  A charade begins, with Bhuvan's bad script seems to be a ticket to money if Devin can convince him he is able to carry the role in Bhuvan's home of Bombay - a Bollywood movie.  Delilah and Devin vie for stardom, Delilah locks the boys in the attic to nurture Devin's need for a relationship, Bhuvan rebels, attempts escape, and the trio become caught up in an accidental death of a snoopy wannabe star neighbor (Trish Dempsey).  Of course they are caught and the ending just gets so silly that it is groanfully bad.

The saving grace of the film is that it doesn't take itself seriously.  The script has some funny lines sparingly dropped here and there and the cast seems to be having a great time with the comedy.  This is a tough film to classify: it has gay themes but very little in the way of gay plot - except for the camp.  This is one of those 'loving hands at home' films that is somewhat salvaged by Skye Aubrey who clearly knows her craft!  Grady Harp, October 06",1160265600,,1950,4.56160458452722
8081037,1,B000AYQO74,"I have never written a review before; however, I have never felt compelled to do so.  Whilst peregrinating through the aisles of a movie rental store in my home of Saint Louis, I noticed this motion picture.  Upon reading the backside, I rented it.  That was a mistake.

I am a person who loves artistic films; I also love films that promote a message regardless of whether I support that message.  I also love dramatic movies.  These predilections, however, do not prevent me from appreciating a comedy.  Tagged as a comedy, however, this motion picture was absolutely terrible; it was completely boeotian in every respect.

First, the film was suffused by over-acting, which is one of the worst crimes that an actor or actress can commit.  Yes, I confess that the two leading men are absolutely gorgeous; however, a gorgeous cast cannot save you from a lack of talent.  The film not only fails in acting, but it also fails in the quality of the script.  The ubiquity of poor jokes is quite vexatious; this horrible condition is only exacerbated by the terrible acting.

I can appreciate low-budget films and those films shot with a digital camera; however, there appears to be no purpose.  If this film were intended to be a parody on many of the films of the sixties, you may see some success in that endeavor, that is if you don't shoot yourself before the conclusion of the film.

I admit that there were one or two gags that created a rictus across my face; however, it was certainly not worth my time!",1154390400,,1508,4.620300751879699
8081038,4,B000AYQO74,"For a low budget indie, this movie is a hoot. A farcical comedy with twists and turns and mistaken identity. Gags and terrifically funny lines are best appreciated by people in the ""biz"". A totally enjoyable entertaining film. If you just want to be amused and aren't looking for heavy drama, pick this one up!",1146009600,3,310,4.654545454545454
8081039,2,B000AYQO74,"Wow.. where do I begin?  The filming is high-school, first college project quality.... lots and lots of gaffes to pick out.  The acting is about the same.  There are some cute moments, but the overall effect felt like a Rocky Horror knock-off.... I am talking some serious camp here folks!!!  The movie really has zero to do with bollywood.... anyway, nuff said.  If you are gonna watch this film... my only advice is... take two tylenol first  (tequila might work)!  :)",1137542400,2,470,4.728395061728395
8081040,2,B000AYQO74,"I wasn't expecting much more than fluff because this was tagged a screwball comedy, but even those meager expectations were dashed when all I got was a ridiculous and totally implausible story line, lame dialog and sight gags, cruddy camerawork, strained performances (which, to be fair, were not the fault of the actors but of the material).  Ugh.  I watched it to the bitter end, though, hoping it might get better, but it didn't. It would almost get some momentum going and then...thud!  The best I can say about it is that the actors portraying the three principals were endearing, and trying their hardest to make the best of a bad situation. I had never seen any of them in anything else, but if the bravura they summoned up for this pathetic vehicle is any indication, they were wasted here and deserve better. There were moments when I was cringing from embarrassment for them.",1134000000,2,885,4.733766233766234
8081041,3,B000AYQO74,"I'm not an expert at reviewing.  I usually don't explain my rating.  But I felt I needed to support my claim.

Okay, this movie is an indie.  And it's more than obvious in the first ten minutes.  (In one shot, you can see the cameraman's reflection in the mirror!)  But I stopped laughing at the incredulities and let myself give it a chance.

I'm glad I did.  It's a cute first(?) movie.  The plot is silly but so are most big blockbusters.  The acting isn't superb but it's still believable.  Somehow I still found myself captivated by this story.

Once you get past the ridiculous, such as the fact that Devin looks the same as Delilah but is a foot taller yet still gets misidentified as the starlet, this isn't necessarily a waste of time.

I wouldn't watch it again on purpose.  But if there was nothing else on, I might indulge myself in a little bit of ameatur filmmaking.",1131667200,6,880,4.41875
