8393851,5,B003BNZIE6,"I just recently got my Lighthouses of California DVD and I've been playing it for the last week or so. This is one cool, moody, beautiful DVD. Sublime music. Restful natural sounds of the ocean. I thought the quality of images was excellent throughout. I watched it on a very expensive 42 inch plasma wide screen and it was crisp, sharp, and high definition in both image quality and audio fidelity. What I like best was how the ocean at dusk progressively gets darker towards the end of the DVD. After the sun sets on a lighthouse you're left with a starkly beautiful contrasting dark blue horizon, crashing waves and storm clouds. Very moody. The HD quality of the image was so good, that even at nightfall you could still make out a twinkling light from a ship out at sea miles away- even after the ocean had turned to black. The DVD captures that last bit of dusk light and it culminates with the starkly beautiful image of a singular beam from a lighthouse fresnel tower rotating in the darkness, a transfixing, hypnotizing, and unforgettable image. Together with the subtle music score, this DVD borders on art.
Interestingly enough, I noticed there's NOT much other relaxation DVDs on the market that capture twilight landscapes. I can only assume it's very hard to capture images after dark. The lighthouse DVD offers ample rewards in this respect, and stands apart in an otherwise crowded field of generic and uninspired relaxation DVDs.
Operational wise, it worked exactly as it was suppose to- it played automatically when I put it in the player, and it automatically returned to the beginning when it got at the end. No problems. I didn't have to do a thing other than load it into the player. I like that. And I played it on my laptop at work, and several of my players around the house. Everything worked fine. My one suggestion is that the scenes didn't last long enough. I wish they would have went on longer than five minutes per scene, just as I was getting into one scene it faded to the next. But that's just me.
If you're looking for bright, flowery, generic images of island beaches at high noon this is not it. But if you want a tone piece that is starkly beautiful, moody, and unforgettable, this one is brilliant. A lighthouse at sea is a uniquely beautiful, hypnotizing structure and transfixing to watch. And this DVD captures it magnificently.",1292976000,,2371,4.6610978520286395
8393852,3,B003BNZIE6,"This dvd is actually a fantastic item. The idea was great to do a dvd like this, the scenes are magnificent and very very relaxing.
You can choose between GREAT music (usually i hate watching relaxation dvds with music but this music does really hypnotize you)or a mix between the sounds of waves and distant fog horns,which is great.
Ok, the scenes are maybe a bit TOO long and they should change more often (more than five minutes for the same scene)but thats ok cause they are all extremly beautiful and relaxing. I also have the zen garden dvds from this producers,they also have not enaugh scenes unfortunately.
The only thing that really disturbes me is the picture and audio quality. The picture does not have HD-Quality, don't get me wrong,its not bad, but colors are not vivid enaugh , it all seems a bit dull,dark and grey which actually is great for a video like this to get you in the right mood, sunshine would not be good here, but this is not what i mean. What i mean is that you just see that they did not use the best equiptment here. The picture is not sharp enaugh,but still ok.
But when it comes to the audio:especially the sound of the waves has a very bad quality, im really sorry.
And then there is another problem:i have tried it with several different dvd players, the dvd does not have any menu. If you press menu all you see is a grey screen-and then the dvd does not work anymore, you can do whatever you want, you can press play,stop, back...everything, but nothing makes the dvd work again.
I had to remove it from the player and then start it again. As i told you before-this is not my players fault,cause ive tried 3 different players-two dvd players and the pc drive! Everywhere the same problem.
But i think you should buy the dvd anyway if you like lighthouses,the ocean and sunsets (or all together).Just don't watch it on a very big lcd and never press the menu button.
This dvd with a better audio and picture quality would deserve 10.000 stars .",1288915200,,1984,4.4532967032967035
8393853,5,B003BNZIE6,"I love my Lighthouses of California ...it's one of my all time favorite ways to relax! I pour myself a glass of wine, kick up the feet and watch the sunset on a beautiful ocean scene. The widescreen photography is absolutely beautiful, the color is vivid, all in all very exceptional quality... and the music and natural sounds are so soothing and relaxing. It starts with the mesmerizing surf crashing against the cliffs below a lighthouse and then slowly transitions to a sun setting and finally ends with a beacon shining across the ocean. But what I like best is the DVD has two separate soundtracks - one with music and ocean sounds... and the other with ocean sounds ONLY. (Usually I prefer the soothing music mixed with the natural sounds best. But sometimes, I'm in the mood to just hear the sounds of the ocean only- it's so hypnotic. Automatically makes me sleepy.) I'm a long time ocean lover, and for my money, Lighthouses of California is the perfect DVD for putting me in the most peaceful state of mind.",1274486400,,1018,4.629834254143646
