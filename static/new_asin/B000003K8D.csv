7902844,3,B000003K8D,"The Klingons have returned to Deep Space Nine.  They're clandestinely mining the Worm Hole passage to the Gamma Quadrant in anticipation of the invasion of Dominion forces.  But Worf's brother Kurn is not preparing for battle.  He has arrived on DS9 bearing Imperial disgrace for Worf's unKlingon actions.  Having lost his House, his Family, his Seat on the Council, and Command of his warship, Kurn can redeem his honor only with his death.  And it's Worf's filial duty to strike the mortal blow with the ritual dagger.  Once again, Worf is conflicted by his Klingon heritage and his Human Starfleet values.  This episode spells the tragic end of the proud character played so magnificently by the incomparable Tony Todd.  In an effort to avoid his unpleasant duty, Worf convinces his brother to instead take menial work on the Federation space station.  Klinfans will cringe in painful empathy to see Kurn brought so low, clad in a Bajoran uniform, loading cargo!  Kurn, unable to endure such misery for long, demands that Worf comply with Klingon custom.  This time Worf's superior officers intervene and prohibit the ceremony.  With their assistance, Worf devises an outrageously ignoble and unKlingon solution for his dilemma... Honorable death would have been better!  Kurn was the epitome of a glorious Klingon warrior, my favorite supporting character of the Next Gen series.  Leave it to DS9 to humiliate and destroy him!  I had hoped, at the series end his fate would have been addressed, but khest it all!  He was never even mentioned again.",1011657600,,1552,5.027450980392157
