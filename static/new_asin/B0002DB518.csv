""Deadly Recruits"" - A western intelligence agent plays a game of bluff and counter-bluff against the KGB's most dangerous spies.

""The Death Merchants"" - An innocent German citizen is pursued by Middle Eastern terrorists after he accidentally sees a message left for a double-agent named Herzog at the Hamburg airport.

""The Sell-Out"" - A retired CIA agent reluctantly returns to espionage at the request of his treacherous student, who has defected to the Soviet Union. Now the agent wants out, causing both the US and the USSR to send their best hit men after him.

""The Treasure Of The Amazon"" - In the steamy jungle, a group of adventurers search for a legendary river supposedly filled with diamonds ""the size of your eyes."" The explorers not only compete against each other, but also must survive ferocious alligators, a tribe of topless female warriors, piranhas, and headhunters.
