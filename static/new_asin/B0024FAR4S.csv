3845948,1,B0024FAR4S,"This is just an extra 2 episodes to show how Michael, the hero of the show, died. They can go to hell with these 2 episodes. The wedding of Michael and Sara lasts about 2 minutes. They do not even show them reciting vows. They posted a wedding photo online to try and sell this garbage to the Michael and Sara fans. I'm through being manipulated. If Michael would have lived I would have bought it, but killing him off ruined the series.",1243641600,5,437,4.27710843373494
3845949,1,B0024FAR4S,"C'mon, this was serious? A DVD for 2 episodes that do not answer NOTHING?

First, we can't see if Michael is really dead and, this was the worse idea EVER to kill the protagonist and ""hero"" of the show.
Second, how Sara got her freedom? She is a fugitive now!

4 years of answers was said, and nearly 1 month passed in this episodes!

With this DVD you murdered this fantastic series and destroyed the good memories. Everyone who really enjoyed Prison Break, will be pissed with this DVD.

My personal recommendation is: If you really enjoy Prison Break, don't watch this..Not worth it. It only furthers the story, without any decent answer or shocking final.",1243555200,7,659,4.655172413793103
3845950,4,B0024FAR4S,"The previously not shown two hours of the TV show Prison Break were packaged as this film. It's a final hurray for the 4-season long show that started out strong and ran into ""creative difficulties"" at the end. These two hours fill in a few gaps that the series finale glanced over. This is definitely a movie for the die-hard fans, as there are character reveals and returning characters as well as the regulars acting in a predictable manner. This is not a stand-alone film. Anyone who has not been a fan of the show, even anyone who has skipped most of season 4, will not really understand what is going on in the storyline and why the leads are worth rooting for. My recommendation is to watch the series finale up to the ""Four Years Later"" sequence, then seeing Prison Break: The Final Break, then returning to the season finale and watching the last few minutes (the montage at the end). The storyline is thus complete and makes more sense as well as provides more canon and insight into the lives and storyline of each characters.",1243382400,128,1037,4.550802139037433
3845951,5,B0024FAR4S,"I just finished watching this for the first time about five minutes ago and I still have tears in my eyes. This movie was wonderful and a must-see for any true Prison Break fan. It did a great job of tying up loose ends and filling in the gaps of what happened in the finale.  I know a lot of people were unhappy about the finale but I think that this movie offers the closure that we were all needing.

A fitting end to a fantastic series.",1243382400,16,440,4.045977011494253
3845952,5,B0024FAR4S,"This is simply amazing. I won't give away any of the plot, but it's definately worth the money. If THIS movie had been made into Season 4 instead of what we'd been given, the show would have been 100 times better than how it ended up. Truly remarkable acting in this, DEFINATELY not to be missed!",1243209600,51,296,4.303571428571429

3845954,5,B0024FAR4S,"This is a straight to DVD movie of what happened between the 4 years they skipped over on the series finale.

3845955,1,B0024FAR4S,i am thinking this is not a divided Season 4 set but the 2 additional episodes that have been taped post-Season 4. It will probably be a 2-hr movie event although an air date has yet to be scheduled by Fox.,1241568000,10,206,4.048780487804878

It's a critical part of the collection and if you haven't seen it and you're watching the new season, then this might help clear up some confusion. There isn't much to the movie, though. Not a lot of twists, not even much of the typical mystery surrounding Michael that keeps the audience guessing about how many ""chess moves"" he is ahead of his adversary. It's more just a gap filler between the two seasons. I doubt it would have even provided a tremendous sense of closure had we watched it when it originally aired.",1493424000,2,619,4.486725663716814

3846012,4,B0024FAR4S,"Saw most of this series when it first aired. Mostly high quality action/suspense material.
I'm writing this mostly to help everybody avoid the confusion concerning this Blu-ray and the Blu-ray package of ""The Complete Series Prison Break."" When I ordered the complete four season package I didn't know it included ""The Final Break"" in it. Yes, at the end of the editorial review it says ""including The Final Break"" and if you zoom in on the photo of the back of the package, it says the same, but I didn't notice so I ordered the separate Blu-ray of The Final Break. Lucky for me, I got the ""Complete"" package first and when I saw that ""The Final Break"" was included I was able to cancel the separate Blu-ray before it was shipped.
Part of the problem, if you haven't had this happen to you before, is that the Complete Series Blu-ray is listed in the ""Frequently Bought Together"" section.
Interestingly, this exact same thing happened to me recently with amazon's dvds of The Munsters TV show. The season two dvd package now includes an extra dvd of the two movies ""Munsters, Go Home"" and ""Munsters Revenge."" That two movie dvd is also available separately and also listed in the ""Frequently Bought Together"" section. And, the season two listing does not say that this extra dvd is included. Of course, amazon gave me a fast refund, so no big deal for me. Just wanted to let everybody know about this situation so you can look out for it in the future.",1448323200,,1453,4.592307692307692

3846016,5,B0024FAR4S,"I typically not a TV show admirer, but I came across one the greatest drama show on Netflix but I was unable to watch all the season. I recently purchased the last season on amazon and really enjoyed watching Prison Break. It's got romance, thrills, adventurous and action.  Prison Break is about one of the main character name Michael Scofield who break-ins a bank only to be arrested and sent to jail. Lincoln Burrows who is Michaels brother was sentenced to death to the same prison Michael spend his time. Few people knew that Michael is the architect of the prison and also have the whole prison plan floor tattoo all over his body. All around the show, you get to know each and every actors, their stories and who they are and their characters; they are really good actors. They are so good that they're not predictable.

The show is well written and comprehensive. It might appear slightly incredible and some realities may be wrong, however, it's completely credible and possible. The show have its own charm and character. The title, Prison Break is obvious from the audience, so you may not think of the show as original. Instead, it is a different twist to an old idea and it is not full with clichs. It gives a truthful image of what could very well be. Simultaneously, you originally have the hero who will rescue the innocent. Nevertheless, Michael does not appeared as superhero, he is seem as the anti-hero.
The cinematography is perfect. Prison Break is one of the greatest show with its unique appearance. The attitude, smartness and achievement is well apprehended in really good looking shots followed by really nice music. If you are looking for a good entertain, sign up on Amazon on buy all Prison Break seasons, you will not regret.",1442880000,,1756,4.716612377850163

I was a huge fan of the original series, so much so that when I had the opportunity to buy the complete set cheap I jumped at the chance and watched all 4 seasons in a Prison Break marathon, something I highly recommend as it is so much better without the episode interruptions each week.  The second half of season 4 struggled to get to a conclusion but it finally did keeping the character profiles intact and then everyone finally sat around the table, gave their written statements and were granted full immunity, Sarah included.  The ""four years later"" wrap-up worked even if we all would have liked a bit more information.  However, the ridiculous plot that is offered up in this later ""Final Break"" is absolutely preposterous and doesn't keep at all with what we learned over 4 seasons about the characters.  Sarah is suddenly charged with a murder that would have been fully disclosed in the statements at the end of season 4 and then thrown into a prison in Florida that is part county jail, part women's prison and part men's prison without even an arraignment????  This after we already have seen that the General will be executed and T-Bag incarcerated in Fox River?  Season 1 took 22 episodes for Michael to carry out his meticulous plan of escape but he has Sarah out in about 2 days. When she runs out the door at the end of the tunnel there are the guys waiting without a soul in sight and then they hang around and chat a bit.  If  it was so unguarded I'm sure Michael could have found a way to easily break in and out that way, especially since he anticipated the problem with the door.  I know we had to suspend reality quite often in the original series but it was so well done that it was okay.  This farce of a wrap-up made a total mockery of everything that a talented cast had done over 4 seasons.  I wish I could somehow erase from my mind that I ever watched it. I am VERY surprised at the number of reviewers that think this made for a good ending.  If you are a real fan of Prison Break do yourself a favor and DONT watch this, it is like watching a cartoon version of a classic film!",1419811200,,2188,4.322738386308068

Loved it very much. But you don't this this movie. I don't understand why it was put together in the first place. I returned and I am very thankful that Amazon gave me a credit.

3846190,5,B0024FAR4S,"For 4 years, Prison Break was the smartest, grittiest, best casted, and best written show on Television. While badly harmed by the 2007 writers strike and low ratings, this show never did get the recognition it deserved. When Paul Scheuring created the show, he wrote a story he'd planned to last six season, however in the middle of season 4, he pulled the plug. Scheuring decided that the show had become a farce of itself and would not longer continue. In the final 15 minutes of the last episode of season 4, they jumped ahead 3 years to the ending Scheuring had originally envisioned, and it left fans with millions of unanswered questions. They were outraged and besieged the network with letters. The result, the events of a hypothetical season 6 were condensed into a 90 minute movie. The movie was a return to the shows beginnings and was terrific! While season 4 did get stupid, this would have been a fantastic season and an amazing way to end the show. Of course when you condense 24 episodes into an hour and a half, it's going to be rushed and have holes, but they do a nice job of trying to explain everything and ultimately do give the fans the closure they desired. This was the smartest show I've ever seen and no matter what this cast does for the rest of their careers, it will never compare to the incredible job they did on this show and in this movie.",1361577600,2,1374,4.47808764940239

No need to negative review this. It tied the ending together and was much more settling than the finale was.

This is not a stand alone, no one should watch this who hasn't watched all of prison break or it would make no sense.

Plus on the show at the end they showed Lincoln etc. went back to Panama to be with his son and that wasn't on this DVD.

Two, this movie is intended for fans and followers of the show. I've seen reviewers on here complaining that it didn't make sense but then also stating they haven't seen the show. You have to watch the show and know what's going on in order to understand the movie! Very simple.

Now as for the movie, I'm a die hard PB fan, so I loved it. No it may not have been a totally necessary movie as if you've seen the series finale you'd just assume *spoiler* Michael died from his tumor. And while I was sad that after all the characters' hard work, not all of them got a happy ending; I personally can't get enough of Prison Break and was happy to see the extra movie/episodes and will definitely watch them again!",1323648000,2,877,4.158823529411765

3846258,5,B0024FAR4S,"I can't believe I actually considered NOT renting this movie after viewing the end of Prison Break Season 4. After weathering the previous four seasons' ""breaks"" with honest-to-goodness delight (with the occasional ""cringe"" stemming from a few predictable, recycled plot points)  -- I had thought I had seen everything Prison Break had to offer. NOT true! I had no idea that the writers and producers could top previous seasons' high points, or that they could top the Season Finale of Season 4, but they did. As the previous reviewer stated, this film ties up a lot of loose ends. I absolutely agree. But I'd like to add that the film does even more than that; the story goes places I thought the show could no longer go. I never imagined that this (The Final Break) is how things could have gone down in that missing ""4 years"" mentioned at the end of Season 4 (in the finale). The writers topped their best moments with this final act. I recommend it with confidence - you won't regret buying this! Enjoy.",1313193600,,1007,4.625698324022347
3846259,5,B0024FAR4S,"This isn't a sequel/movie to the hit fox tv show that ran for 4 years. Think of it as a midquel (a sequel to the original but prequel to the sequel). It takes place roughly sometime before the 5 minutes of the final episode.

Sarah has been arrested for murder and sent to a woman's prison. The General finds out and while in prison himself, orders a hit on her. When Michael finds out, he plans to break her out to protect her and their unborn baby.

This was very good..probably better then the series finale itself. We learn why they were in South America if they were free and how did Michael die.

Get this if you love the show

Pros:
-Fills in the blanks the series left with
-Good plot",1301097600,2,692,4.21969696969697

Some people have said it's a little anticlimactic because if you've seen the final episode of the show then you know how The Final Break is going to end. I agreed with those people before I watched this, but now that I've seen it I can say it is well worth it to watch this. This should've been included in the series finale on television. I don't know what the reasons were for not including it, but it's unfortunate that that decision was made. It plays just like an episode from the series and gives great closure for all of the characters. The final minutes of the television finale now make much more sense and hold a larger emotional punch.

The end of the episode flashes forward several years and what is revealed leaves one guessing as to what exactly happened. If you watch The Final Break, all will be revealed and understood. It was great.

What is interesting is that after every episode the name Agatha Warren, co-producer, would pop up on the screen in the first of credits, it was replaced with another co-producer when she got promoted I guess to one of the executive producers.  After awhile I got to dislike her name, because it meant the end of the episode and I had to wait another week!  LOL

Well......in Final Break, my favorite villian, Gretchen, kills Agatha Warren with a swift karate kick, sending poor Agatha flying into a coat hook that was on the wall in the prison shower  OUCH! (just like Midnight Express when the evil prison guard met his fate the same way, minus the shower) Agatha was in Daddy's Family.

3846353,4,B0024FAR4S,"The final episode of Prison Break ended with a ""4-Years Later"" title card and a startling revelation in the final shot. It could have ended there, leaving the audience to wonder how everything happened that way but the creators of Prison Break opted to create this 88-minute movie to tie up those gaping plot holes and clarify all the fan's unanswered questions. Gaping plot holes was never a big deal for Prison Break, but it was a nice gesture...However, as I'll explain, I wish they would've done it just a little differently.

All the actor's/character's from the fourth season return for this, which takes place right before the four-year title card, but after the ""ending"" of the last episode. Without giving any details away, this film makes Sarah (Sarah Wayne Callies), the girlfriend of Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), the main character. All the plot holes are covered up with events surrounding her...It does a fine job of filling us in on questions we may have, but my one complaint will go over the head's of some. Even as Prison Break grew more and more ludicrous, I found that it never lost its ability to excite and entertain. It was always a drama as it's core, hinging much of it's success on the love audiences had for it's characters, but few shows have made my heart race the way Prison Break did. This movie had 80-minutes to wrap up a series and seemed more of a way to just get everything out of the way than tell a story. The way that it favors dramatic elements over exciting elements would have made it one of the weaker episodes had it actually been a part of the fourth season.

For those reading this, keep in mind that this is intended only for those who have watched all four seasons including the series finale. This is not a stand-alone film and will make little or no sense to those with little or no familiarity with the series.

If you're a fan, this is essential viewing. That last shot of the series opens up a lot of questions and I'm sure you'll want to see what went down to cause that, but therein lies another problem. If you did watch that final episode, you'll notice a major lack-of-suspense due to the knowledge you have about the character this movie hinges on. It's that character that really eliminates all suspense, but all who have seen that final episode know the fate of all these characters. Yes, this shows how they got there but the knowledge we have makes everything a lot less effective.

At 88-minutes, it's obviously a bit simplified on top of everything else but there are moments that do contain a sort of dramatic poignancy, particularly the final scene which in it's own simple way brings more closure to the series than the actual ending did. As I said, this is essential viewing for fans of the series but hardly an essential release. I think everything from here could have been initially incorporated into the actual series, but perhaps done differently. With that said, The Final Break will clarify anything that had you scratching your head when that last episode faded to black...But you won't necessarily like it.

But as to answering questions left unresolved in season 4, it just made everything a whole lot more questionable. So we know how Michael is supposed to die based on us watching all the previous seasons, so when he finally dies in season 4, it is natural to assume that it is from his current condition. But then we are introduced to a whole new scenario of which although plausible and entertaining, it really did not need to be added. Especially since Sarah and her son are not even pretending to be on the run anymore, when really they should be based on the events of the movie. I could continue with more loopholes but do not want to give any spoilers. Maybe I just did not get all the connections of the movie to the final season and need to watch the movie again, but in my opinion the movie not only left a few questions unanswered from season 4, it also introduced some new ones which did not get resolved.

3846409,2,B0024FAR4S,"Sadly, the Prison Break series which started with a bang but kept slowly sliding downhill from the peaks of its glorious First Season, ends lamely with a double whimper. The Final Break is the second and final 'end' and, truly, nothing but what were meant to be the last 2 episodes of the series.

I wish I could say that The Final Break at least stays true to the standards set by the 'seasoned' episodes but the viewing feels more like the series death by exhaustion. By the time we reach this final break, Sarah's - I'm not revealing anything that's not on the blurb printed on the back of the movie's case - everything and everyone, appear to be tired, bored, unconvincing, no longer having much fun. Yes, many of the old characters are back and we get to see the insides of a women's prison but, to borrow a line from an old commercial, this addition is 'less filling' without tasting that great. What in the previous episodes and in the early seasons was so outrageously impossible most of us would willingly suspend disbelief and have fun watching the escapes and plot twists is now almost ridiculously impossible and I found it impossible to relate to the characters any longer. I watched The Final Break with detachment, frequently checking the 'remaining time' counter. When it all ended, the feeling was of relief for it all being over. Finally.

Concerning the Blu-ray release:

- Once the disc begins play, you are greeted by what seems to be more than half a dozen (didn't count them) promos for some mediocre series and movies including some available on DVD only, not on Blu. You'll have to repeatedly 'skip' to get out of this inconvenience because you can't escape by pressing the 'menu' key. I hate when 'they' are trying to force us to watch their commercials after we actually pay for their product. This shows disrespect for the customer.
- The picture quality is consistent to that of the 'regular' TV episodes - it's 'good'.
- There is only one sound track option but the sound setup, interestingly, is part of the Setup menu - and you get to choose one out of the only one option available - the impression the 'menu' leaves is that all was thrown out to us, the indiscriminate 'consumers' very much on the cheap.
- The 'extras' are made off 2 (two) deleted scenes and nothing else.
- The plastic case has some strange perforations/holes that probably make it more likely to break and whose reasons is difficult to understand other than maybe saving a penny or two on plastic.

That's just about it. Both my wife (a huge fan of the series) and myself are glad it's over. We are very likely to watch Season One and maybe some of the seasons that followed again but I can't see us re-watching The Final Break or the last few episodes of the last season.",1248825600,,2776,4.557114228456914
3846410,2,B0024FAR4S,"Sara's ordeal in this movie is ridiculous. I find it hard to believe she would fall outside the line of protection when her safety was the sole reason that a deal was ever negotiated for Michael and everyone to be exonerated. If Sara isn't safe, none of them are, and that's the principle that ultimately undermines the peace and freedom that Prison Break has sought to conclude from day one.
It's somewhat fun to see Gretchen one final time, but her fate is more irritating than it's meant to be. Michael's fortune is the worst. He's bypassed all kinds of high-security doors, floors, walls, tunnels and fences and in the end he can't open a single door without making the most horrifying sacrifice in the entire series. It makes little sense for Michael to be an amazing engineer and not be motivated to devise a backup for he and Sara so that he might live long enough to see the birth of his child. Basically, this movie spoils the television finale and creates a fugitive all over again. It should be completely disregarded.",1248739200,2,1029,4.628415300546448

3846422,3,B0024FAR4S,"I LOVED prison break.  Quite possibly my favorite show ever.  I was incredibly excited to watch the ""Final Break.""

The ""Final Break"" itself was fun to watch.  It adds a bit more to the series, you get to see some of your favorite characters again (I don't want to spoil all the returns) and it's quite interesting to see the little sister from ""A League of Their Own"" (it's one of those ""is that her? wow"" type moments).  This is essential for fans, will complete your Prison Break Collection and is worth watching.

My complaint though is I can't help but feel a little ripped off.  For almost $15, I essentially get the equivalent of 2 episodes (when full seasons of 20+ episodes can be obatained for under $30-$40) with nearly NO SPECIAL FEATURES.  All they give you is a couple weak deleted scenes.  It would have been quite interesting to at least hear some commentary, or a featurette as to why this disc was created type-of-deal.

The right thing to do would have been to put this on the season 4 DVD.  That would have bolstered season 4 sales and been a nice thank you to the fans.  I realize that overall this might yield better profits, but it was the wrong thing to do.",1248652800,11,1181,4.416666666666667
3846423,3,B0024FAR4S,"I am a huge Priosn Break fan. I was so upset when Fox decided to cancel the show. I mean, I would watch the show no matter where they were breaking out of. It could have been a 7-11 for all I care. When I heard this movie was coming out, I was very excited about it and just had to get it.

Perhaps my expectations were too high for this movie, but it wasn't what I expected. It was good, since it wraps everything up from the series, but the movie was just very predictable. It was almost as if I knew what was going to happen before it did, and already knowing Michael died didn't help much.

All in all, if you are a Prison Break fan, you have to watch this movie. I would recommend you rent it versus buying it, but I bought it and don't regret it. I am very fond of the actors and buying this is like having the last peice of Prison Break out there.

Still, it was like a very crammed TV episode. I never thought I would say this, but the TV show with the commercials actually made it more interesting. Having no commericals, there was never really any suspense as to what was going to happen. Things just kept on going until the end.",1248652800,3,1139,4.053333333333334

Season 2, stupid. Season 3 started interesting in Panama -- but then everything fell apart and TONS of ""Big Clues"" went NOWHERE (Hello? The Bird Book, the bricked-in Australian?). Season 4 was beyond stupid (Did the ""brilliant"" General EVER get anything right, beyond making empty threats like a 3rd rate James Bond villain? T-Bag (brilliant in season 1 was adrift 90% of the time in subsequent years) Sara: Yikes - she lost her head! No, she DIDN'T!!! Michael, the GREAT Wentworth Miller NEEDED TO GO ON A DIET. No offense (and I'm not no Mr. Universe) -- but the guy was supposed to be the sexy star of the show. He looks really handsome 15-20 pounds lighter -- but he's spent the last 2 seasons with the ""layered"" look trying to (unsucessfully) hide his weight. Particularly noticeable in the flashbacks. Season 4 Finale was touching and 75% saved the series' credibility (rock bottom the last 2 years) -- but the movie -- I want my $19.99 back!!!! -- it was TERRIBLE. Stupid, boring, atrocious acting (except T-Bag) & really, really felt like 2 stupid TV episodes slapped together (which it was) & then used to rip off fans (which I presume it did -- it sure ripped ME off). The movie REALLY felt like the worst of Season 4. ""Daddy"" was an ABYSMAL actor & the whole ""escape plot"" was dumb & uninteresting (& CERTAINLY not 'movie caliber'. Besides -- since ""the government"" was after Sara, how did they get Michael's body down to ""Costa Rica""???? for that tombstone, hmmm? Plus, him ""sacrificing"" himself over such totally unconvincing ""trumped up"" charges against Sara was extremely dramatically unsatisfying. A total downer.

3846456,2,B0024FAR4S,"******SPOILERS*********SPOILERS********SPOILERS*******SPOILERS

After watching Prison Break Season 4, I had no desire to watch this 2-hour addition, but I just wanted to complete the circle.

I have read that this was made because the network gave the ok for 2 additional episodes after announcing the show was canceled.

This ""sequel"" (it covers a short period between the moment the team gives back Scylla and the 4-year anniversary of Michael's death), shows how Michael breaks Sarah out of a woman's prison.

If we just consider that the whole team was given full immunity for getting Scylla back, this edition is utterly absurd and an insult to the show's fans.

I gave it 2 stars because the actors continue to give strong performances, because it is more in line with the fast pace rhythm of Seasons 1-3, and because it tried to give some solace to the many fans who were devastated by Michael's death; by showing that he died honorably, of his own choice, by sacrificing his life for Sarah's freedom.

I am one of those fans who was very upset with the fact that Michael was killed off in Season 4, but I can accept that sometimes there are creative decisions that fans may not agree with.

If Season 4, including this Final Break would have been intelligent, not so full of inconsistencies and ridiculous story lines; I would be more willing to accept Michael's death.  I think many fans are disgusted because to add insult to injury, the writers gave us an unrecognizable Prison Break in Season 4 (see my review); and a 2-hour sales pitch to the network for doing a show on a woman's prison, with this Final Break segment.

I feel cheated by the writers, not because they didn't give me a happy ending, but because they gave me a stupid one in this Final Break and Season 4 fiascos, after creating one of the best shows of television history.",1245715200,18,1852,4.708978328173375
3846457,3,B0024FAR4S,"I watched this and wasn't impressed by it.  It seemed like this would have been a decent idea for a 5th season, but since the show was cancelled they decided to cram the whole story into an hour and a half.  It seemed very rushed considering the whole first season was him breaking out of prison, and in this dvd he breaks Sara out in an hour and a half.  I would recommend seeing it if you're a big Prison Break fan because you have to see how the story ends.  If you're not a huge fan definitely don't get this.  Invest in the first two seasons, they are definitely worth it.  The whole plot wasn't well thought out.  They never explained why Sara was sent to prison even though she was exonerated in the series finale, and the subplot with the ""family"" was really dumb.

I also don't agree with them not adding this to the season 4 dvd, but that's a different story.",1245110400,11,869,4.224242424242425

3846459,5,B0024FAR4S,"I have just finished watching PRISON BREAK: THE FINAL BREAK online....all I can say....it's amazing!!! The writers did a very good job tying loose ends.  Great finish to a great series!!!

First off, I know many fans of the show did not like the end of season 4. I, myself, thought it was a great ending....however, I still felt like something was still missing....Michael's death went too fast, unexplained.  Well, this movie does indeed make a much better ending to the series than the end of the 4th season did.

The subject of Michaels death leaves me to my next point. The end of the 4th season finale makes you to believe Michael was sentence to death by health reasons.  Although this does play out a little in the movie, the whole idea of Michael's death is blow away in a totally different aspect....which the writers have successfully proved Michael's character of ""sacrificing himself to help others in his life"" throughout the whole series. Kuddo's to the writers!!! And I know, fans wanted more of a ""happy ending"", but at the end of this movie, despite Michael's demise, it really is a happy ending because it is what the central character wanted....Michaels decision alone....which stayed true to his character throughout the series.  Like someone else mentioned earlier...the movie is similar to a Shakespearan type novel....like a Romeo & Juliet feeling to the story.

Also I would like to point out, that if you are a fan of the 1st season (the best season, in my opinion), this movie has a very close resemblance to the first season.  It is VERY ACTION PACKED, and has that same intense feeling you got when watching the 1st season. Very enjoyable!!!  In fact the action is so ongoing....I didn't think the movie would have a satisfying finish....but it does.

Another last note....the movie also reveals the question ""What ever happen to Gretchen?"".  Which was nice to see that they tied her character's story line better than they did in the 4th season. She was always a favorite character of mine.

All and all, I highly recommend this movie!! It definitely ties the loose ends that the 4th Season finale left us...with a better explanation to Michael's demise.  Prison Break: The Final Break, has a much more satisfying ending!!! Mainly due to the fact that the central character (Michael) remained true to himself thru out the entire series. Michael was in control of his decisions, no matter what sacrifice he had to do.....making the ultimate sacrifice to the end of this great series.  If this was novel, it would be considered, imo, a GREAT BOOK!!!",1244419200,19,2576,4.825

I think it is unfair that countries such as Australia include this movie as part of the season 4 box set while here in the US fans are expected to shell out an extra $17.99 for the extra 2 eps.

That being said, I just watched ""The Final Break"",which aired in the UK and Israel but Fox won't show here, and thought it was pretty good. It got back to what Prison Break was originally about in season 1- and to a less enjoyable extent in season 3 - breaking out of prison.  Was good to see most of the unkilled regulars back including Gretchen who was absent in the TV finale.

I think this movie is definitely worth watching, but think the price they are charging here in the US is highway robbery.",1243728000,3,872,5.119718309859155
