8600637,5,B000S1KSFI,"As a baseball coach for 38 years at the high school level, I have purchased many different dvds on the teaching of baseball to stay current with the baseball gods.  Dr. Bagonzi's dvd series is hands-down the best for teaching the art of pitching.  Over the years we have been involved in 14 championship games and we owe this success to his in-depth teaching of the necessary skills.  The dvds are of high quality and mirror his clinics' content while providing additional commentary, unique insights, close-up pictures and graphics to be used with any age group. There is no one better at teaching pitching at any level.
