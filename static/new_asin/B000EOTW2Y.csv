2525477,1,B000EOTW2Y,"..and lead us not into another teen zombie movie!  Five generic youths head off to Mexico to join a brother and his friends for surfing.  The beach itself looks like an abandoned sandmine and the actors are about as interesting as the encyclopedia Brittanica in Italian.  The camera work is the worst I've seen in some time..give this guy some Zoloft and take a bunch of Dramamine yourself to avoid motion sickness.  Though not a true ""zombie"" film, its plot is silly and its execution atrocious.  Avoid.",1148774400,2,504,4.747126436781609
2525478,2,B000EOTW2Y,"Trespassers is another one of those typical, wrong place wrong time horror flicks where a good looking group of young friends out to party and have a good time end up dead.  This time the group is off for a trip to Baja Mexico for some surfing, sex, and alcohol and wind up on a deserted beach.  One of the group disappears, leaving his video camera and they seem him grabbed by something on the tape.  This has been used too many times in recent films.  In town they group learns about the history of the beach.  It was evidently home to some religious nuts at one time.  Their leader did an unspeakable act and was killed.  Now he's back for revenge on anyone who dares to trespass on his beach.

It's not terribly original which I can live with.  What I can't live with his absolutely some of the worst camera work ever scene in a film.  Was the camera man drunk or did he just have a nervous tick which caused the shaky, jumpy camera work in many spots.  It really made it difficult to watch.  The acting was nothing to write home about either as this was strictly amateur hour and it certainly showed.  Although look for Clayton Rohner in a bit role.  Rohner has a ton of acting credits including the 80's teen comedy, ""Just one of the Guys"" and 80's slasher flick ""April Fools Day"".  The women in it are pretty hot...they just can't act.",1148428800,5,1343,4.316
2525479,5,B000EOTW2Y,"Using the aspects of a surf trip and a cursed land, this film will do very well in DVD sales i feel. I also cant wait to see the sequall. more blood and gore...and surfing.",1143158400,5,172,3.942857142857143
8112129,4,B000EOTW2Y,"I liked this movie. It does make you wonder about going somewhere where no one else is around. If I had seen what was seen in this movie, I would definitely be leaving and praying for a way out!",1376697600,,194,4.0
8112130,1,B000EOTW2Y,"This camcorder film is total unadulterated garbage, and that's being nice. The only good scene was the one girl flashing her rack, but that's not even worth the time you would waste on this film. Don't waste your money and don't waste your time if you have prime on this monstrosity.",1371686400,,283,4.568627450980392
8112131,3,B000EOTW2Y,"The state of border security is truly pitiful, when groups of idiot surfer-dudes and dudettes can just wander into Mexico whenever they please! These ""legals"" simply drive across the border, surfboards in tow, looking for isolated beaches to infest. Drawn by ""epic waves"", these unwanted anglos are taking over! Thankfully, bands of crazed, hungry cannibals await them, since the authorities certainly aren't doing their job! TRESPASSERS is evidence that these folks need to stay home. What makes them think that I want to see a bunch of pale, blond-haired surf-junkies running around loose? Sheesh...",1368489600,,601,5.404255319148936
8112132,3,B000EOTW2Y,"It had sexy women and good elements of a zombie film.  But it lacked something.  Maybe a coherent plot.  A curse?  really?  The characters weren't believable.  Maybe the gore needed to be stepped up a bit.  The filmakers just flashed the bloody bits across a wildly held camera shot.  Very annoying film style.  The conversation with the local, in spanish. went on too long.  Not a complete waste of time.",1365811200,,405,4.6571428571428575
8112133,4,B000EOTW2Y,"I didn't say great movie,.is obvious a small budget film,.most of the action takes place at the beach,.they are supposed to be in a small town of Mexico,.group of friends trying to have a good time, unaware that there'r some sort of beast in the region,.acting is very much acceptable, has it's moments of action and scary climax,.I did like it,.maybe no for a collector, but most actors are good looking.",1300665600,,405,4.71830985915493
8112134,1,B000EOTW2Y,"Dreadful. Literally the first 1/3 consists of a bunch of shallow jerks acting like a bunch of shallow jerks. Then one of them bears her breasts for no reason. Then a guy masturbates. Then night arrives and we can't see a thing because everything is so badly under lit, and we have to further guess what's happening because the editing is so choppy. The back-story is hackneyed and just dumb, and the half-ast attempts at character development are, well, half-ast. Calling this movie amateur hour would be an insult to amateurs.",1287792000,6,527,4.802197802197802
8112135,3,B000EOTW2Y,"A group of American surfer imbeciles go to an out-of-the-way beach in Mexico and get harassed by unseen rat people.  It's sub-inferior material, but well enough exploited to sit through.

The horrible camera and lighting work (the excess of the movie, and all of the action, was too dark and characterized by a heavy dimness or obscurity, rather than bringing any atmosphere or tension, it was just irritating - literally, often you cannot see what's going on).

The scary scenes were remarkable in having no bloodshed, too fast and murky editing, and the acting, lousy.

I will say, I think it would have worked better as a 30 minute movie, because the story is downright empty-headed, like someone made it up in about 1 day.",1287360000,5,726,4.784
8112136,5,B000EOTW2Y,"This movie looks like it was shot on a handycam and the actors seem raw and unpolished enough to be real teenagers.  The mexican settings are very atmospheric and set an uneasy tone to the movie.  The cinematography is claustraphobic and dark for much of the film and so you actually feel like you are there.  Not unlike the Blair Witch Project - polished cinematography has been sacraficed here for raw enagement - for me it works - but others may find it hard to get past the scratchy production values.  This is one of the most surprisingly good horror/zombie movies I've seen in a while.

The storyline follows a band of five young surfers as they head to a remote piece of Mexican beach to hook up with central character's brother.  When they finally arrive their day starts off well with some hot surfing from the guys and a bit of topless nudity from the girls.  But when they start wandering among the sand dunes around them - what they discover is very disturbing.  Abandonned SUV's, fleash picked human skeletons and by now the party has already been split up.  Things don't get any better for anyone.  Raw gritty and real - this is a hardcore mexican surfer zombie movie without a scrap of humour in it.  I'm sure we will hear more about this among zombie fans as more people discover it.",1160179200,5,1299,4.5085470085470085
8112137,2,B000EOTW2Y,"This film had some some real potential.  The characters are not that likable or interesting, but there some scenes that could have been very creepy; if only you could make out what the hell was going on in the almost pitch-black nighttime ""photography""; I could hardly see a thing.  The bit with the Jim Jones-like fanatic ""religious"" cult is quite interesting, and the long-unseen Clayton Rohner makes a cameo as the deranged ""rev""; the film had SOME promise, what a shame you couldn't see most of what was going on.",1149120000,3,517,4.733333333333333
8112138,4,B000EOTW2Y,"The Trespassers is a gripping tale of teens looking for fun and finding horror instead. The surf is awesome and makes me want to go check out the Baja scene but now I'm afraid I'll find scary people like things that crawl around in the dead of the night eating people. The place name, Punto Abre Ojos, Point of Open Eyes, contains the message that these poor teens should have listened to. For most of them, they learned too late... maybe in the sequel the survivors will redeem themselves.

The acting shows potential with the hot girls, handsome leads, and some quirky perverted videographer who is part of this young group on a road trip adventure to a Baja surf camp.  Michelle Borth is a pretty and talented young actress. Kaiwi Lyman plays a sensitive and athletic lead who we hope to see more of. The horrors they face are the horrors we face when, to our peril, we don't keep our eyes open to the horrific fundamentalist agenda.",1148860800,9,936,4.5325443786982245
