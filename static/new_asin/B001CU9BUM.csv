8289447,5,B001CU9BUM,"Teachers & Space geeks alike need to get this DVD! Hopefully it will inspire kids to pursue the sciences and exploration to other worlds. As of 2011 thanks to Obama, the one true innovative part of the US goverment has pretty much shut down.  Hopefully when he is out of office there will be a renewed optimism in space exploration & our children will be at the forefront of what humans by natural instinct do, we explore!",1330128000,3,422,4.48051948051948
8289448,5,B001CU9BUM,"""Beyond the Moon: Failure Is Not an Option 2"" is an excellent introduction to the world of NASA's mission controllers after the glory of the Apollo program faded. Certainly the Apollo-era team left mighty big shoes to fill, but this documentary discusses the transition to a twenty first century Mission Control, both in technology (goodbye MOCR, hello FCR,) and in the personnel plugging into those consoles.

Various missions are emphasized, each with a ""this could be the end of manned spaceflight if we don't get this right"" angle: that for me got tiresome. The things that pose the biggest threat to manned spaceflight are the fickleness of politicians and the NASA budget which has been chronically underfunded in recent decades. Nonetheless, the information on Skylab, ""Challenger,"" ""Columbia,"" and the Hubble fiasco is well presented and the interviews the filmmakers picked were extremely well selected.

I was happy to see the new controllers and Flight Directors (there's tons of them now compared to the Apollo era) interviewed, and I think their spirit and perspective are what we need to take leadership in space once again, if they can get a program that's actually funded correctly. Having said that, it was the interviews of the old hands that put the programs in perspective that I most enjoyed. Listening to guys like Gene Kranz, Gerry Griffin, Glynn Lunney, and Jay Greene discuss spaceflight makes this DVD a treasure.",1302912000,4,1439,5.1191489361702125
8289449,5,B001CU9BUM,"This is a fantastic view of everything that happened at NASA since the Appolo moon landings. Part one is a fantastic view of everything NASA from the very begining through the moon landings, including the Appolo 13 near disaster. Unfortunately, do to an error on the manufaturer Part one, Failure is not an Option doesn't work well....well, at least on ALL my DVD and Blu Ray players.

The story is told by NASA engeneers from start to the second shuttle disaster, mpst;y by Gene Krantz and Chris Croft. Other engeneers do chime in from time to time letting you know the feelings of all the ground controlers

This is a fantastic two part series, ftne played on The History Channel. if you do get a chance to see both of them, DO IT. you will learn a lot.",1267660800,,755,4.463768115942029
8289450,1,B001CU9BUM,"They have labled the product correctly since I ordered this and received Part 2 back in the summer of 2009.  Still I will leave the one star as I ordered twice.  If you want Part 1 it's available as part of ""The Race to the Moon (History Channel) DVD"".",1247961600,4,252,4.122448979591836
