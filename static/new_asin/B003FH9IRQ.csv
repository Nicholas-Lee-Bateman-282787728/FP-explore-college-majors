4118546,4,B003FH9IRQ,"I can see why some may have gave this movie low marks. But it is undeniably funny. It is dark with classic Paul G elements.  I usually watch extremely serious and depressing movies.  When I do watch comedies they are usually in line with Woody Allen, Coen brothers, Curb your enthusiasm.  If you like comedies in that sense, I think you will enjoy this one. It is not American Splender or Sideways Paul G, but nonetheless - enjoyable.",1278633600,,434,4.538461538461538

8395969,4,B003FH9IRQ,"Billy Crudup is one of those actors who never gives the same performance twice and always outshines the material he's been given.  When he made ""Rudderless"", co-star Felicity Huffman (no acting slouch herself) said she had to  ""up her game"" in scenes with him, that he was the ""real deal"" and on a different level of acting. In this slight,pointless film, Crudup is every marketing guy I've ever worked with. I have worked in ad agencies, and I know this guy well. Crudup NAILED him. The fluttery, high-pitched little laugh Crudup does is sheer genius--because I recognized if from salespeople I've actually know. For an actor to pay attention to that small detail--the way a character laughs-- yeah, he's on a whole different level. Giamatti, on the other hand, plays his usual grumpy self. But the interplay between these two great actors is worth the price of admission.",1499644800,,873,4.891891891891892

8395973,1,B003FH9IRQ,"This was pretty painful to watch and that was probably the intention.  The performances were good, but they couldn't save a film with few other redeeming qualities.",1424649600,,164,5.074074074074074
8395974,1,B003FH9IRQ,"This  ""Rocket-Propelled Misadventure"" was just stupid.  It goes nowhere and does nothing.  An idiot takes a set of blueprints off the internet or gets them from the library or something, he has no business sense at all, talks a unemployed rocket scientist into making a rocket belt with the financing of a closet homosexual who will do absolutely anything for him.  They didn't invent it, they just used the prints.  The homosexual friend loses his successful business and everything providing the funds for this as the idiot can't get any funding for it.  The scientist and the idiot feud over the belt and the idiot steals it.  The belt is never seen again - the end.  This is a bad movie.  Poor plot, poor storyline.  Not worth a watch.",1423094400,,739,4.658914728682171
8395975,3,B003FH9IRQ,I really enjoyed the acting although the story didn't really appeal to me. It's one of those movies you should watch and expect nothing but good performances by actors like Paul Giamatti and Billy Crudup.,1411084800,,204,4.857142857142857
8395976,5,B003FH9IRQ,"It's storyline is surprisingly  close to the actual events of the TRUE STORY of the RB2000 Rocketbelt. It shows how money, power, fame, fortune and greed can twist and turn people against one another and change a wonderful dream into a total nightmare. Add to that the mufti-talented Paul Giamatti and actor Billy Crudup and the (underused) comedic antics of SNL's Kristen Wigg make Pretty Bird a very unique film that should have made it to the silver screen of the major movie theaters.",1369180800,2,488,4.809523809523809
8395977,4,B003FH9IRQ,"This is a very simple story about a venture capitalist, a scientific genius, and a slick talking marketer who secretly intends to steal all the profits from their rocket belt in a side deal.  It's interesting how the two dupes just take it for granted they will be needed for every stage of the process until their ""partner"" behaves strangely.  The response and outcome is amusing.",1369008000,2,381,4.757575757575758
