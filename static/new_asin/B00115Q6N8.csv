The director of this character assasination obviously had a political agenda(Note the poorly educated, and morally corrupt, liberal wing-nut actor chosen for the narration).

It has been a museum since 1889. I worked in the Andrew Jackson Building in Nashville while working for the State of Tennessee.

That was my motivation for keeping the production around for posterity. However, I have to say that when I watched the program when it was aired on public television in 1/08, I was thoroughly engaged, entertained, and educated. There were many things I learned about Andrew Jackson and the early politics of the American presidency that I don't recall learning about in my school days. Among these was the fact that he was the first to actually be elected by popular vote, and in that, kept the presidency from being a ""good old boys"" legacy to be passed on to Washington insiders and power brokers. Trivia buffs and presidential historians will find this a valuable addition to their collections. For myself, it will be a memento of my son's 20 seconds of fame.",1204588800,13,900,4.666666666666667
3060579,5,B00115Q6N8,"Yes, this might seem a little like revisionist history if your only
study of American History was in High School and you remember the two
pages of ""Jacksonian"" history they cramed in between the Revolution
and the Civil War. History takes years to unfold and to see
it clearly. Maybe Jackson was a product of his times, but during his
Presidency Indians and Slaves were not ""white"" and they were treated according to the customs of the times and Jackson did not change that.
There was even fear of them banding together to challenge whites, this is something I don't remember from High School history, but it helps explain the Seminole Indians Wars and the the Trail of Tears.  Is that revisionist? No, I call that insight into the American Experience and the reason you study history: to find a cause.
He had the opportunity as every President did from the founding of our Nation, to challenge slavery and abolish it, as did the British during in 1833, DURING HIS PRESIDENCY. Instead he did as all other Presidents before him, he choose to ignore it and hope it would go away.
Another fact that I never learned was the assination attempt on Jackson's life. Great documentary on a controvertial President.

""Andrew Jackson was a patriot and a traitor. He was the greatest of generals, and wholly ignorant of the art of war. He was the most candid of men, and capable of the profoundest dissimulation. He was a democratic autocrat, an urbane savage, an atrocious saint.""

3060580,1,B00115Q6N8,"I cannot believe the trash that I saw when I watched some of this disrespectful and slanderous TRASH, A.J. Good, Evil and the Presidency. It is a rancid pile of revisionist, ANTI-AMERICAN, tripe. It sickens me to listen to the so-called intellectuals and Martin Sheen on the program apologetically describe Jackson's victories over the Creeks, and other Indian tribes and his slave-holder status as a basis for us to publicly judge him and his actions at this time and place. We have no right to, so far removed from the circumstances in my opinion.

The fact is, Jackson was a controversial character in his time, but NOT for the issues mentioned above. It was not Jackson who started black slavery, nor did he attack the Creek Indian tribe unprovoked. They, and other tribes as well, killed hundreds or possibly thousands of scattered settlers over the preceding years including women and children, and a strong case could be made to praise those Americans for their forbearance to retaliate until it could be condoned no longer.

I can only surmise that the reason for this kind of inappropriate and unacceptable SLANDER contained in the above named PBS show is to salve their own guilty consciences and/or line their own pockets with donations from special interest groups who also stand to gain much from THEIR donors. That to me, is not only unsavory, but classless and base.
