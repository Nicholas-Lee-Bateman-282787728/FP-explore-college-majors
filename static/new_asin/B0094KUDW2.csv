8535997,2,B0094KUDW2,"This is an amateur production of some sort, that does not resemble a Hollywood film in any way. I bought it based on the very high reviews given this 16 minute short film, on imdb.com, & I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.

Although the persons involved seem to have made an earnest attempt at film making, it falls far short on all of the normal criteria by which a movie is judged, & nothing new or different is presented here, in terms of plot, action, or dialog.

As a film, I give it 1*, & I add 1* because I think the persons involved made a sincere effort while lacking professional film-making skills.

It may have some appeal to a younger audience (perhaps 10-14 years of age?), but as an adult film, there is little to recommend it.",1347494400,,741,4.2785714285714285
