8077284,4,B000AARL0M,"Out of the four discs released so far for this show, volume 4 is the most intense by far.  The prodigal son, Hanma Baki, finally has a showdown with his dad Yujiro, aka ""The World's Strongest Man/ The Ogre,"" and someone's gonna die!  Episode 14, ""Lullaby,"" is a stunning conclusion to what I call the ""prologue"" for this show, because the first 14 episodes really focused on explaining the relationship between Baki, his mom, and dad, and why Baki has such a deep personal hatred for his father.

The 15th episode, unfortunately, is a recap.  The 16th episode, and the last one in this volume, begins the next arc in the series, and features a new, different Baki.

This volume features four episodes dubbed in Engligh with stereo sound or 5.1 Dolby Digital, and subtitled in English with Japanese stereo.  Although Funimation rates the show ""TV PG,"" I would argue that episode 14 rates a ""TV 14"" (not suitable for viewers under 14) because of the intense violence in that particular episode.",1132963200,2,992,4.738372093023256
