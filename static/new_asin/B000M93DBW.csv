2727191,5,B000M93DBW,"It seems that all the great innocent family shows like ""The Nanny"" and ""The Cosby Show"" are so slow in being released.  Why is it that shows like ""Friends"" gets released all at the same time.  Are the television companies worried that we might actually stop watching current TV and watch DVD's instead?  My family loves The Nanny and it is painful having to wait everytime we finish a season, even if we watch one a day.....or one a week.",1176768000,9,438,4.45
2727192,5,B000M93DBW,"Season 3 of The Nanny contains some really great episodes (as do the subsequent seasons, of course). Fans of the sexual tension between Fran and Mr Sheffield will delight in this season, as it contains Mr Sheffield's fake proposal to Fran in ""The Two Mrs Sheffields"", a number of spontaneous kisses, and of course, The One Where He Tells Her He Loves Her On The Plane Back From Paris (and then takes it back!). Along with all the usual comedy, of course. So when are they going to release this season on DVD? Come on, people!",1176595200,10,525,4.479166666666667

When we JAG fans were waiting for that series to come out on DVD, Amazon offered a ""notify me when it's available"" option.  Hey, Amazon... Please offer that for The Nanny - Season 3, too!",1174003200,45,333,4.5
2727195,5,B000M93DBW,The Second Season was released May of 2006! When will the third season come out? My whole family is dying to see more episodes; we've already memorized seasons one and two. Please Sony! Release it now!,1172361600,13,201,4.611111111111111

2727208,5,B000M93DBW,"I love ""The Nanny"" !!.  Ms.  Fran Fine has the comedic timing and facial mobility of a classic Lucille Ball.  Sylvia is no bad actress herself!  And the whole cast just hit their stride during this season.  The writers are still on their game, and this season rivals the first two (which I own!) for situation, ridiculous outcomes, quick and zingy retorts,  and sexual tension.  The costuming is still stunning and the addition of cameos by high Hollywood talent is hilarious.  I just laugh and laugh.  This series is the best medicine ever!",1442275200,,541,4.731182795698925

Watching THE NANNY on DVD shall be even better than watching it in reruns on Antenna-TV, TV Land, Lifetime,Nick At Night, and Cozi-TV.",1397779200,,626,5.019230769230769

2727250,5,B000M93DBW,"However we all know she is about a 24 now.  why in the world she let herself get so big.  I adored her show and all the kids and the father and the butler as well as her MA.  not to mention all her family members and the Granny who was Millie on the Dick Van Dyke show.  she was a hoot.  I ordered all that was available and cancelled my cable due to the fact that for the price I spent on cable to watch my favorite sitcoms I can order what I want and see them when ever I want. It was so hard to find one of my sitcoms having to dig through all the garbage on TV and they would be on so late at night I would fall asleep missing them.  I can watch my TV programs News on my computer and with Kindle I can see old movies, and recently released ones too!
so I am only going to write this one review for all of Nanny's seasons.  I saw she was losing weight too.  for  her new show is based on her real life finding out her husband was gay. I think this is when she put on the pounds.  I would have too.",1390176000,,1001,3.7014218009478674

2727256,5,B000M93DBW,"I love this Series, it is always funny and captivating.

In season three we deal more with Fran's relationship with Maxwell, it honestly took a while for them to truly start venturing into them as a possible couple. Really the only negative comment I have about this product relates to the package and not the show itself. All three DVDs came to me in a single box, stacked atop one another. That is very bad for the DVDs and them getting scratched. I did have to buff the one in the middle a little to get out a tiny scratch that probably happened during delivery. I suggest buying slips to put them DVDs in or blank cases.",1384992000,,624,4.333333333333333

2727258,5,B000M93DBW,I am just finishing up season 3 and I can't seem to get enough. This was a great show with very good actors who seemed very believable.

2727259,5,B000M93DBW,"I never watched this show when it was on.  I guess I thought it was silly.  I started watching in syndication and it is very funny!  It is definitely a character driven show.

2727265,5,B000M93DBW,"Since everyone is going SO crazy in ALL the reviews of the 3 seasons, WHILE YOU ARE WAITING you CAN see the series on """"ANTENNA"""" TV Network punching in 011 02 and two empsodes are there every WEEK night at 8 pm for a total of an hour each day.  It's at least the next best thing, although not like OWNING it, I know but a temporary substitute that not many might realize, and this is on the Analogue antenna BOX.  Just today Wednesday Sept 4th, 2013 the LAST episode of the series was aired then the FIRST Episode right after it in the next half hour, which seemed to work out perfectly for Fran's Jewish New Year's day  lol [and mine too lol].  SO if you turn to that you can catch the series from the beginning.... before they come out with the last three seasons on DVD, hopefully, which seems to be problems of getting the guest star's approvals, a matter of rights, etc., which is very disappointing, I do agree.  Hope this helps.",1378339200,,936,4.295454545454546

My only real complaint is: where are the rest of the seasons?? They came out with seasons 1-3 on DVD and then left us hanging - and, seriously, do I even have to mention what a hassle it is to sit through half an hour's worth of commercial to see a 25 minute episode with re-runs?

2727275,5,B000M93DBW,"Another great season to view and enjoy. The first season is the best, but season two follows up nicely and season three is another nice follow up to the first season. Well done. A native New Yorker born and bred and from the sleeper Borough of Queens myself, I have to admit that I love this show, though bits about big hair and her voice are way over the top, yes exaggerated for those whom never have been to New York City before. The parts with the loud talking, interrupting and slapping each other are so New York city. If you need a laugh a minute this is the show to watch. It is otherwise so New York city. It is hilarious. Now mind you, I never viewed this show when it first aired. I have no idea why, except that I wasn't watching TV at the time this aired. I'm now working my way through the DVD series. Where was I when this shirt first aired? Fran Drescher is just too funny.
Overall, this is a wonderful series for the entire family too watch and grown up enough for just adults.",1373587200,,994,4.182291666666667

2727282,5,B000M93DBW,"I grew up watching reruns of the Nanny in the late 90s. The Nanny brought laughter into my life, during a time when my life was bleak as I was battling depression. It's a fantastic show and I've watched the episodes multiple times! I used to tape them on my VCR so I could re-watch them whenever I wanted to. Even though now I own seasons 1-3 on DVD, I still can't discard my VHS tapes. I keep having this scenario that if my DVDs get stolen or Sony stops the distribution of the DVDS, then I'd still have them on VHS! I know it sounds irrational, but that's how much I love this show! Fran Drescher is outrageous as Fran Fine. The characters are a colorful bunch and the actors have done a remarkable job. I absolutely love the banter and zingers between C.C and Niles. It was only a few years ago when I discovered that Daniel Davis (the actor playing Niles the Butler) wasn't British! In my opinion, his British accent is more pronounced than Charles (Mr. Sheffield). Daniel's comedic timing is impeccable! I think he's the true star of the show. I love the dynamics between Sylvia and Fran( I can't picture anyone but Renee Taylor playing the role of Sylvia. She'd outdone herself) and Sylvia's obsession with Fran getting married. I guess every woman can relate to that! Lol.

While I like shows like the Big Bang Theory, they don't get me to howl with laughter like The Nanny. A few days ago, I was watching on my laptop the episode of when Niles catches Fran in the tub with Mr. Sheffield, and I made the mistake of drinking water during that scene. My monitor as well as my keyboard were covered in water. Luckily, my laptop is still working. So when you watch this and plan to have food/beverages, please keep electronic devices and gadgets far away.

Like Just Shoot Me and The Practice, The release of The Nanny is also a no show. My patience is wearing thin. VERY THIN. I'm normally not a collector of DVDs, but when it comes to my favorite shows, I want them on my shelf. I don't understand why Sony isn't releasing The Nanny seasons 4,5,6. It incenses me to know that crummy shows that haven't even garnered a wide audience or have been cancelled have been released, whereas the aforementioned shows are being awfully delayed. I'm starting to sound like a broken record, because that's exactly what I said in my review of Just Shoot Me. What gives?? I am flat-out irritated. Sony, please release the remaining seasons! It's 2013! Please don't make us wait ten years for season 4 and another ten years for season 5! It's been looooong overdue!",1364774400,,2556,4.494623655913978

Shows like this have become rare with the ""reality show evolution.""  I like a good comedy, and The Nanny always delivers!

UPDATE:  I purchased this DVD while recuperating and didn't pay close attention to the set, and hadn't watched in a couple years.  Breaking it out yesterday, I noticed two things.  First, no episode guide came with my set, and the fact that the discs are on top of each other is a real issue - the can get scratched easily - very poor planning on Sony's part.

Second, The music has changed in the episodes. In Val's Apartment, it should be Judy Garland singing, and that is not what is heard, which really ruins the concept, as Mr. Sheffield gives Fran a Judy Garland CD at the end of the show.",1362960000,,874,4.4125

2727303,5,B000M93DBW,"I would just like to clarify that I am a teenager and I do enjoy classic television such as I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Bewitched, Full House, Family Matters and of course, The Nanny. The Nanny is probably my favorite out of all of them mainly because I've watched it the most. I love the series' plot lines and characters. My favorite seasons would have to be seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 because they have the best plot lines and the episodes are nothing but non-stop hilarity. Fran Fine is the nasal tone, street smart nanny who looks after Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield's kids and teaches them everything she knows about being street smart in New York all the while getting involved in crazy schemes and trying to get the kids' father to fall in love with her (which he does and they marry in season 5). To help her out, Fran has Niles the Butler and nothing is going to stand in her way, not even Mr. Sheffield's business partner, C.C. Babcock, who has had a thing for Mr. Sheffield for quite some time. I started watching this when I was 12-years-old and I still watch it today. I've watched all six seasons on TV (thanks to Nick at Nite) and I own seasons 1, 2 and 3 on DVD. Too bad they haven't released seasons 4, 5 and 6 yet. Oh well.

The set comes with three discs, but each are stacked on top of one another.  To me this was a cheap way to package delicate items.  Possibly these discs could become damaged this way. All of my multi-packs have never looked this way.  Saving money is fine, but do it in a more common sense factor.  Customer satisfaction is highly important, and I don't feel that skimping on quality packaging to protect the goods is a good idea. If the discs become damaged from this, then sales may be lost from word of mouth. Use the appropiate amount of disc storage in the case, which makes sense to me.",1263254400,4,704,4.33587786259542

Besides it is now on Nick at Nite so I can watch it anytime. I already own season 1 and will get season 2 but I will have to think about getting or not.

I would have given this a lower score but I love the show too much to do so. I doubt they will fix the packaging so I guess I will have to buy it this way because I love this show so much.",1242864000,4,591,3.5384615384615383

2727368,4,B000M93DBW,"I give season three 4 1/2 stars. let me qualify that:
I love The Nanny, Fran Drescher and all the actors made this show a hit. I have a problem with SONY. They are too cheap to keep the original songs in the shows- they must not be able to afford the royalties! poor SONY!
For example, episode 6 ""the shopaholic"" -the song ""you better shop around"" was taken out, episode 27 ""a pup in Paris"" -a beautiful song about France was removed, and episode 5, ""Val's apartment"" Judy Garland's ""the trolley song"" was taken out.
I've got to say, the new songs take away from the moment the show is in, and they are ridiculous.
the packaging is cheaper then seasons 1 and 2, I can forgive that, but taking the songs out, SONY, come on!
Sony, before you release seasons 4-6, keep original show the way it was!
Send your executives out to collect donations in their Bentley's if you must to keep the original show - it's for the fans and not you!",1238889600,11,931,4.295454545454546

Lots of fun episodes here; my favorites being ""PEN PALS"" (how can you not love Niles having CC ""cluck like a chicken""???), ""A FINE FAMILY FEUD"" (with Maggie's ""sweet sixteen party""), ""SHOPAHOLIC"", and ""THE UNKINDEST CUT"" (Brighton passes out while videotaping a bris for one of Fran's relatives).  It's also nice to have the rarely-seen animated holiday episode ""OY TO THE WORLD"" included with this set.  One word of caution that hasn't been mentioned yet... I had to dock this one star due to some obvious music substitutions.  Three that I can think of at the top of my head include a generic instrumental replacing the 2001 theme music that originally appeared in Fran's fantasy as an astronaut (from ""PEN PALS""), ""Shop Around"" being replaced during ""SHOPAHOLIC"",  and the most glaring example being generic disco music replacing ""Clang Clang Clang went the trolley..."" from ""VAL'S APARTMENT"" (totally watering down the joke when they open the door thinking ""maybe there are some straight men here after all!"").  Aside from that (and my agreement with the bulk of the reviews here regarding the packaging of the set) I'm glad the wait is over for Season 3.",1238025600,,1306,4.808035714285714

I got Seasons 1 & 2 the very first day they were released. Season 3 is one of the best seasons and ends on a cliffhanger that continues and starts off Season 4. Even though we know what's going to happen we still get anxious and what to know what's next! I really hope Sony to take another 100 years to release the rest of the seasons.

Disc One:
The Pen Pal
Franny and the Professor
The Dope Diamond
A Fine Family Feud
Val's Apartment
Shopaholic
Oy Vey, You're Gay
The Party's Over
The Two Mrs. Sheffields

Disc Two
Having His Baby
The Unkindest Cut
The Kibbutz
An Offer She Can't Refuse
Oy To The World - Special animated Christmas episode
Fashion Show
Where's Fran
The Grandmas

Disc Three
Love is a Many Blundered Thing
Your Feets Too Big
Where's the Pearls?
The Hockey Show
That's Mid-Life
The Cantor Show
Green Card
Ship of Fran's
A Pup In Paris

The Only thing I don't like about this set is the way the discs themselves are contained. The case is a standard size dvd case and all three discs are just stacked in there on top of each other.

I'm wondering will an online petition do any good? Will writing Sony do any good? I would love to know if Fran Drescher has any pull or say in this matter.

I've watched Seasons 1 & 2 so much that I have most of the episodes memorized. I find with all the crap that is on tv today I'd rather watch older tv shows on dvd.

I don't understand why you can find bad TV shows that no one likes with every season on DVD, and this quality show still hasn't come out.

The Nanny is a favorite among a vast number of fans--including myself. I believe that it was one of the best comedy shows to have aired on television in the 90's. So let's go! Release it already!!

Well, in the interest of sounding redundant, please, please, please hurry up and make The Nanny Season 3 available for sale. At this rate, when it does come out, it would probably be sold out within the first week!

As an added bonus, perhaps Season 4 should be released at the same time--you know, just to give us adoring fans a little something, something--don't you think?",1195430400,10,816,4.5
2727425,5,B000M93DBW,"I wrote to Sony Pictures Television. The nice person who replied said that he had no idea what was going on with the Nanny. It's obvious lots of people want it. So, people? Write them, call them, and write them more.

And this is coming from someone who thought he hated the Nanny. ""Ohhhhhh!"" I hear coming from the readership. That's right - hated. I was in the army when it was on, and thought I didn't care for the nasal voice, not ever actually watching the show and never having the first clue how clever, versatile, and heart-warming the show is.

Taking strong cues from the classic Lucille Ball, The Nanny succeeds so well as a comedy for the very reason that it does draw in so many different elements. Friends and Everybody Loves Raymond, both excellent comedies, are homogenous and essentially mono-cultural (Debra and Amy are Protestants while the Italian Barones are Catholic, but that's it), and middle-class, and are consequently limited in their comedic space. The Nanny brings together a lower-middle class Yiddish family (the nanny's family), together with its weighty Yiddish vocabulary and customs, with distinctly upper-class British (Maxwell and Niles) and American (the kids and CC) elements. The result is the opportunity to explore cultural clash and mis-communication outside the cultural and economic spaces of the other aforementioned shows. Together with a cross-cultural moral compass and a realistic appreciation for realism and diversity, The Nanny has incredible room to maneuver. And it does, much to our comedic delight.

The Nanny is overlooked in retrospect, including by its corporate masters who are concentrating on rolling out other projects. But The Nanny was a very successful show and was contemporary with Everybody Loves Raymond, and let's not forget that the two shows crossed over with each other. And if one keeps in mind that Fran's ""annoying"" voice is indeed intended to twist the premise of ""The Sound of Music"" in a fun way, one realizes that it becomes an empowering feature, not a defect, in the show. Honestly, anyone who isn't hooked on the lives of its characters after a few episodes either didn't watch or doesn't like sitcoms. You just can't lose with this show.

And for those of us who already know this, you've GOT to contact Sony and let your voice be heard. If enough of us bug them, they'll pay attention. They just want to know that people will buy the last 4 series if they roll them out.",1194825600,3,2457,4.899038461538462

I noticed in the previous 2 that the ""High School Sweethearts"" was taken out in the closing credits. I am sure everyone made plenty money off the show.
