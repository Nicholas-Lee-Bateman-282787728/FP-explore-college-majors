3526304,5,B001D68NEU,"After watching this children's program on television, and finding it intelligent and not condecending, I decided to send it to my granddaughter. I am an artist and I was paricularly fascinated by the animation style. My son has always loved dragons so I thought his little daughter might enjoy watching this story with her Dad. It also gives her some variety from the numerous Japanese anime shows and the newer fad characters. She enjoyed the first Jane and the Dragon CD that I sent and has continued her enjoyment with this second episode.",1231286400,5,542,4.838709677419355

3526326,4,B001D68NEU,"I can't disagree with the sentiment of the other reviewers. My daughters love the show. The animation is good and the stories seem fun and Jane is a pretty good role model for girls.

One thing that needs to be more obviously noted: This DVD release is not Subtitled. If you need subtitles you will be sorely disappointed.",1360972800,,322,4.551724137931035

3526328,5,B001D68NEU,I had discoverd this Childrens series while I was on vacation.  It is not currently aired on our cable system at home.

3526331,5,B001D68NEU,"Jane & the Dragon,
Is an awesome any very cleverly created series.
I most definitely recommend it for children and adults alike!",1349740800,2,128,4.863636363636363
3526332,5,B001D68NEU,"These are some of the best episodes, kids love them and my husband and I know them by heart already!",1341360000,,100,4.05
3526333,5,B001D68NEU,"My 4 year old granddaughter and the whole family really enjoy Jane, her friends, and the dragon shows.  They are well done, show conquences of poor choices and teach good moral standards.",1335571200,,187,4.84375
3526334,5,B001D68NEU,"Jane and the Dragon is one of the most charming children's television shows I have ever seen. The series focuses on a medieval girl named Jane and her best friend Dragon. Unlike most girls of the time, Jane chooses to take her destiny into her own hands and seeks to become a knight, rather than settling to become a lady-in-waiting. The stories focus on (as one might expect from the title) Jane and Dragon's various adventures and stories. These two make for great lead characters, and audiences are easily drawn to them. But like most good shows, there is an outstanding supporting cast of characters, from the gardener Rake to the clever and witty Jester to rival squire Gunther. Indeed, it seems as though every character has been very well thought out, and there is a great amount of depth to each and every one of them, whether they appear in every episode or merely a few. The endearing cast of characters contributes much to the overall success of the show.

But this attention to detail is not just found in the characters -- it is in fact throughout the entire show. The 3D animation is stellar (done by Weta Workshop -- better known for their work on the Lord of the Rings), the art design is beautiful, the music is catchy and the dialog is well written. It only takes watching a single episode to realize the extraordinary amount of effort put into the show by its developers -- a trait that many other shows, children's or otherwise, would do well to emulate.

Each episode runs approximately 22 minutes long, telling an individual, stand-alone story focusing on Jane, Dragon, and often several of the supporting cast. Like most children's shows, there are valuable lessons about life and friendship within the series; fortunately, these are integrated quite seamlessly into the stories and rarely ever feel forced or out of place. The stories are complex enough that adults should find them enjoyable, while at the same time not becoming so complicated as to confuse children.

""Dragon Rules"" continues the series from where&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-And-The-Dragon-A-Dragon-s-Tale/dp/B0019BI11E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane And The Dragon: A Dragon's Tale</a>&nbsp;left off, containing the next 5 episodes in the series.  The episodes on this set, in order, are ""The Offer"", ""Dragon Rules"", ""All Fools Day"", ""Dragon Diva"", and ""Adventures in Royal Babysitting"".  Of these, my personal favorite is ""Dragon Rules"", the episode for which this DVD set is named.

While all 5 episodes are quite enjoyable, this set is overall a weaker selection of episodes than its predecessor, and considerably weaker than many of following episodes in the season -- ""A Pig of a Problem"", ""Mismatched"", and ""The Last of the Dragonslayers"" for instance are some of the best in the entire season.  If you're not familiar with the series, I'd recommend looking into the first DVD instead, as it provides a much better sense of the quality of the series as a whole.  That said, if you're already a fan of Jane and the Dragon, then there is absolutely no reason to miss these episodes, as they are well worth watching.  Even if these are not the best Jane and the Dragon have to offer, this set still easily earns its 5-star rating.",1329523200,11,3281,5.027624309392265
3526335,5,B001D68NEU,Me and my kids love this cartoon! It's full of wonderful lessons in values and morals. I wish there were more episodes!,1309305600,,119,4.454545454545454
3526336,5,B001D68NEU,I am sooo happy these DVD's are finally available!! I can't recommend a better animated show for kids and adults alike! Beautiful amination and story lines. Hurray for Jane and Dragon!!!,1281916800,,186,5.032258064516129
3526337,5,B001D68NEU,"How animation has changed since Gertie The Dinosaur.  Compare Winsor McCay's dinosaur to the Dragon in Jane and the Dragon, and the results are amazing.  This has to be the healthiest cartoon series ever made; not just because of the motion capture animation, period appropriate music, and the faithfulness to Martin Baynton's imageries, but also that positive lessons are taught without condescending, that even the less than moral characters, like Gunther are shown that they have a decent side, and the detailed animation on Jane, Dragon, Sir Theodore, Pepper, and the princess are unforgettable.  How refreshing to meet a laughing, vainglorious dragon, with a penchant for cows.  I was disappointed at the special features on volume two, but perhaps the featurettes I was seeking about the making of the show, were in volume one.  The Jane and the Dragon DVDs will appeal to people of all ages, no matter how jaded they may be.",1279238400,,931,5.01948051948052
3526338,5,B001D68NEU,"My granddaughter since she was 10 months (now one year old) watches the Qubo network. She may not follow the story line but smiles broadly when she hears the theme music and sees Jane on the screen--I think it's the hair. Jane gets her undivided attention. I enjoy J&D as well. We're collecting the series. Great stories, very educational, and at the same time entertaining.",1275177600,4,374,4.769230769230769
3526339,5,B001D68NEU,"The quality of any television series, regardless of target audience, comes down to the stories and the writing used to tell them.  This series is one of the best aimed at children I've ever seen.  They are very well written and performed, and they are never condescending.  What can I say?  My wife and I are over 50, and we watch Jane whenever we catch her on the DVR.",1265500800,13,369,4.304347826086956

3526343,5,B001D68NEU,"We checked these out from the library before knowing anything about the shows at all. We don't watch network tv so we're a bit out of the tv loop. As soon as we watched the first episode my 6 and 4 year old and I were all hooked. We hadn't even finished the first dvd and I was on Amazon ordering both dvd's, Dragon Tales and Dragon rules. They are superb in language and storytelling. The art is modern but manages to transport the viewer back to ancient times with a magical ""old"" feel. The stories are sweet and the characters are all lovable. The angst in each episode is short-lived and always works out in the end. 4 year olds, 6 year olds and apparently even 41 years old like that! Wonderful dvds. We've watched them over and over again.",1235692800,20,745,4.290780141843972

I was pretty bummed about it until I found the two DVDs w/a few of the cartoons. Get it for your kids and watch it for yourself. Guaranteed you will enjoy the antics of the Dragon, the great artwork and amusing characters, as well as a cartoon about a girl who is determined to become a knight. I love the princess, too.
