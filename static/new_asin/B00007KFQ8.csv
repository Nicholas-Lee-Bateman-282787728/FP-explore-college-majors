 This movie is indeed very bizarre, still to this day in 2017, & it has been quite a lost gem over time. Basic plot: Young woman had a miscarrage, and both she and her husband find themselves in the company of what turns out to be a bizarre group of twenty and thirty somethings who form a weird witch like cult led by an even more macabe and strange but highly intelligent much older man in one Orson Welles.  They soon realize at first these folks are both a neo-pagan counter culture group, and a sex cult who follow their own bizarre religion similar to that of real life whacko Englishman mystic Allister Crowley. This group is totally weird, but also it appears they are benign at first.

 But then the girl has mysterious dreams, nightmares, and ghoulish encounters until finally she discovers the weird frightening truth. I had generally really very much enjoyed this movie, and found Welles's performance so astonishing as this villain I would place him up there acting wise with other amazing past movie-tv show villain actors such as James Earl Jones's ""Darth Vader"" & ""Thulsa Doom"", Heath Ledger & Jack Nicholson's ""Joker"", Ricardo Montoban's ""Khan"", Robert England's ""Freddy Krueger"", Ian McDermand's ""Palpatine"", or Gary Oldman's ""Dracula"".  This late man's performance in this very dated old film had really stuck out for me, it is that good even if the rest of the film isn't a masterpiece.

  The movie does have some sexual scenery, a few adult themes, a lot of nudity, and some very powerful frightening horror imagery with some mild violence but not once did this film ever cross the line into any gory or sadistic bloodletting to the level of ""Halloween"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" level so for me the PG rating was just right. The film is not for very young kids but I say it would be a fun horror witch themed adventure thriller for older kids from 10 up along with teens and adults.

 If you enjoyed other horror thrillers which were not total monster or slasher fest films, but had good satanic and demonic imagery similar to vampire or warlock movies you might really enjoy this one like I did.  A- for ""Necromancy: The Witching"".",1490659200,,2353,4.654589371980676

7977318,5,B00007KFQ8,"Of all the witch films made in the 70's, this has got to be one of the best. Orson Wells is truly great as the Warlock and High Priest of a small town coven. The ritual scenes are a triumph featuring extremely detailed altars, great costumes (especially Orson Wells dressed up as the Goat of Mendes) and delightfully bad acting. I will cherish this VHS forever. I am somewhat surprised it is not yet available on DVD.",1265846400,4,417,4.428571428571429
7977319,4,B00007KFQ8,"This movie is a very strange one indeed. It is edited from its original version, and was originally called Necromica-""a life for a life"" 1972. Lori Brandon (played by Pamela Franklin) moves to the mysterious town of Lilith with her husband Frank (played by Michael Ontkean) when he receives a new job at a novelty company. At the start of the film Lori recalls an incident in her childhood where she literally brought a friend back to life after drowning in a pool. But Lori also just lost a baby during childbirth and is in a state of shock. When Lori arrives in Lilith she soon discovers that there are no children, all the couples are young, and the couples are not aloud to have children.
Once sealed in the guarded and gated community Lori tries to understand the motives of her husband's mysterious boss, Mr. Cato (played by Orson Wells) and his satanic cult that the entire town belongs to. Only Lori can see the ghost of Mr. Cato's dead son who seems to be trying to warn her about what is going to happen.
As the movie unfolds Lori reads up on magic and spells to help her understand what is happening to her.
***Here's where the plot starts to differ from its original release.
Lori discovers the town is casting spells upon her and begins to counter the magic they are sending her way with some spells of her own. Photomontage footage flips from the work of the cult members to Lori casting her enchantments till the film reaches its climatic conclusion at an abandoned gravesite.
The end sequence of this film differs in the two versions of the move. One film plays a decent from the coffin to the underworld in reverse. The other film plays forward and follows one of the funeral attendees in their journey to the netherworld.

Either of these movies is creepy and eerie enough for a good watch for the heck of it. My only question is: why didn't Lori just use her powers to resurrect her own baby at the beginning of the movie?",1239667200,7,1941,4.483050847457627
