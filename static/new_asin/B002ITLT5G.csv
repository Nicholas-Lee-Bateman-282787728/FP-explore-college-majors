8739219,5,B002ITLT5G,"I think this DVD is ""organic food"" for playing violin, it gives us great health.
In the DVD, Ms. Kato Havas gives clear instructions and demonstrations to play violin without suffering. I learned a lot, and all of her natural gestures will help my son to learn violin enjoyably.
I highly recommend this DVD to parents(save money), students(less suffering), and teachers(correct teaching).
Thank you(Ms. Kato Havas)very much.",1400716800,11,424,5.343283582089552
