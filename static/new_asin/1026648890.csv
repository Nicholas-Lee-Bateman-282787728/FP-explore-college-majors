7795425,3,1026648890,"So i got my Victory tour dvd this afternoon and didn't waste time sliding the disc into the player,There are two tours on one disc,The Kansas City and the Toronto tour. The former was fuzzy but being a Michael Jackson or the Jacksons' fan,I stuck it out and watched it to the end anyway.
Then came the Toronto experience....Which blew my mind!!,It was a lot clearer and that kind of made it better that the Kansas City one was unwatchable. Having read other peoples' reviews,I couldn't agree more that we could get better dvds with all the technology available out there today. Overall i am happy to have gotten my hands on this dvd becuase i have been dying to see the victory tour live footage all my life!,And finally i have today...Thanks to all the parties concerned.",1490572800,,772,4.601449275362318

7795428,1,1026648890,"Why can't we get a decent - or any - copy of the Victory tour???!  With all the Michael stuff that is on the market, where is the DVD of this tour?  It was a hugely significant milestone in Michael's career as this was the end of his musical association with his brothers.  Come on Estate, ANYBODY, we all know there are copies of this footage out there!",1356220800,5,354,4.176470588235294

I just purchased this today (6-25-12,Michael's anniversary)from one of the vendors by the Apollo in New York City. I have been DESPERATELY searching for a CLEAR copy,if anyone can tell me where I can get a CLEAR copy, my e-mail address is Danielle1771@hotmail.com, I would be FOREVER GRATEFUL oh and by the way for those who have it the concert is EXCELLENT, I remember I went twice:)",1340582400,5,474,4.3977272727272725
7795430,4,1026648890,"This product arrived over in UK fairly quickly which i was pleased about. When i first tried to play it i thought it was a blank disc as thats what my laptop said - not the wrong region but blank, and my dvd player on the tv which normally plays everything won't play it either, but then i found it will play on my desktop PC which is older than the laptop and it is not blank and it looks quite good - can anyone explain why and if there's anything i can do to play it on tv dvd player - it just doesn't start, as if there's nothing in the disc tray.

from what i have seen the picture looks very good for a 1984 recording and transferred onto dvd, but unfortunately i have lost sound from my PC, nothing to do with this, it was before, so i can't watch it at the moment at all until the PC is fixed - well i can watch it but can't hear anything! i would like to play it on the tv, i am surprised i can't as i can usually play region 1 and 2 at least on it, so it can't be that.",1279411200,5,979,3.7524271844660193
