497019,4,6302717612,"Great cast, good story and pacing makes this a fun and enjoyable murder mystery from the '70's.  Garner is a small town police chief investigating the murder of a women (initially thought to be the result of a dog attack.)  Katherine Ross is the sexy new love interest.  Hal Holbrook and a host of cameos round out the cast.  Very enjoyable little crime-drama.",1297468800,2,360,4.666666666666667
497020,3,6302717612,"I was thrilled to see this title in print, as Katharine Ross is one of my favorite actresses. Please note, I have yet to view this DVD. But, I learned today after viewing the WB Archive Collection website that this is not a remastered version. It is simply a video master produced as a DVD. Thus, I already have concerns about the quality. If I had realized this before purchasing, I probably would not have done so. This apparently is the case for all DVD titles available from the WB Archive Collection.",1266364800,2,505,4.5
497021,3,6302717612,"This 1972 film is the first and probably the best of four, varied 1970s movies by the same writer about sensationalistic small-town murders solved by the local police chief against the backdrop of quirky town regulars and a casual romantic interest. The others are: (1) Isn't It Shocking (Alan Alda, 1973); and (2) The Girl In The Empty Grave and (3) Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977).

Here, Chief Abel Marsh (James Garner) returns from a Los Angeles vacation to read in the paper about a local woman's death while he was away. She was found dead at the beach, with her pet Doberman ""Murphy"" beside her and its bite marks on her arms. Marsh finds some suspicious signs at her house and learns that Dobermans strike for the neck, not the arms. So he has the woman's body exhumed and autopsied. He discovers that she was drowned in fresh water but dumped in the sea. He also learns that she was pregnant. Her ex-husband (Peter Lawford) tells Marsh that she ended the marriage because she was in love with a woman. Although the killer stripped the victim's house of evidence, Marsh finds in some litter on the floor a photograph of an unidentified nude couple running toward the beach, away from the camera. He takes in Murphy. He also starts a romance with Katharine Ross, who plays the assistant to veterinarian Hal Holbrook, husband of June Allyson.

Marsh arrives at the victim's house to meet Lawford. Marsh finds the house in flames and Lawford unconscious inside, before being slugged. There is a nice scene as Marsh uses the phone in the house (his car tire and radio cord were slashed) to call for a fire truck and ambulance, only to have to sit outside and watch the house burn down and Lawford die, because the assailant, who took off in Lawford's car, blocked with the car the ""one-way tunnel"" between the town and the house, delaying the reinforcements. Further deductions lead Marsh to a suspect, who drugs and eludes him in an implausible scene (why would Marsh take the bundle from the suspect, tying up his arms, instead of handing it off to the owner, who was standing right there?). Marsh pursues the suspect and gets closer to the killer, with limited help from the bungling county police and apparently little or none from his own men. His relationship, such as it is, with Ross, falls apart due to his work on the case, at least for now.

Unlike Alda, Garner is credible as a police chief. He uses a gun, breaks up a bar fight, and comports himself with authority. Unlike Griffith, Garner plays the role straight. The supporting cast is good, even if not as well-used as Alda's. There is more plotting and detective work in Garner's than the others. It strikes a better balance between serious and light elements than the dreary Alda or silly Griffith versions. Garner's has pleasant music and some good use of locations.

But problems spoil fuller enjoyment of the movie. The plot depends on Marsh not being able to distinguish a 30-year-old woman from a 55-year-old woman. Why did the careful culprit leave the crucial photo behind? And there is no explanation for how the case could have initially been so badly mishandled (mistaking cause of death for bite marks, instead of drowning). The director seems to go out of his way to present early scenes as unpleasant and loud (Marsh banging incessantly on the police car horn outside the station; a waiting room at the vet's with countless barking, jumping dogs; sickly lime green counter trim and wallpaper in the victim's house; Marsh clumsily knocking things on the floor there).

Garner acts so sullen and cynical that he lacks his usual charm and energy. Marsh's catch-phrases ""Neat,"" ""City folks,"" and ""When you know where not to look, that tells you something about where to look,"" feel overused and phony, not natural. Marsh wisecracks about ""triple bourbons for lunch,"" gleefully brings a second full pitcher of beer to his table, and always has a bottle handy. Nothing is made of this. Although likable, attractive actors, the relationship between Garner and Ross is hasty and unexplained in how it begins and especially ends, with excruciating, slow-paced scenes in which he, doing tight-lipped slow burns, and she, inquisitive and confused, take forever to say nothing. Lines that are supposed to be significant are incomprehensible (suspect tells Marsh, ""You're shrewd, Abel, but you're not very smart""). Marsh is too rough with Ross and with Murphy.

There is little depth to the characters or relationships. Allyson is a mere stick figure plot device, with only a brief glimpse early and a few coarse, bitter lines (""She was a bitch.""; ""If you're so smart, you find the car.""). The victim is left obscure. Marsh's deputies play no meaningful role. The running joke of the gung-ho county police's incompetence is taken too far when it causes a death.

The plot relies on sensationalism and innuendo rather than clear, satisfying explanation. The killer's confession is nearly incoherent (""....There was nothing left of him. Nothing of me. I had no choice.""). The movie seems to exploit homosexuality and ""threesomes"" as plot gimmicks. It can be crude and offensive, as when Marsh jokes to Ross' question about why he is still single, ""I'm a faggot. Have you seen the women in this town?""; Ross remarks, ""I guess dykes don't use the pill.""; a deputy laughs hysterically when discussing with Marsh a young woman who had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy with her in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road; Marsh mutters in response to Lawford's new teenage-looking floosie girlfriend's question about whether there are motels in town with vibrator beds ""in the box,"" ""In the box, neat....City folks.""; and dirty old townsmen quiz Marsh about ""Did he get much?"" on his L.A. vacation.",1175817600,28,5788,4.816901408450704

497023,5,6302717612,"For me this is one of those great, underrated movies that I end up watching whenever I'm channel surfing and I find it's on. James Garner is great as a slighty cynical and world weary small town police chief in a coastal California town, but the supporting cast and the characters they are given to play are worthy of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. My personal favorites are Edmond O'Brien as the owner of the local liquor store and Arthur O'Connell as the proprietor of the town coffee shop. The details of the story are so choice: the town has trouble getting enough of an appropriation to buy the police department a new typewriter because the county sheriff, Harry Guardino, has a thing for gadgets and has spent out the budget on a helicopter; two officers working late at night in the office start getting punchy when they get a phone call about an unusual complaint. The mystery is a nicely written story without holes, and it doesn't dumb down to anyone. Hammett fan? Rockford fan? You'll have fun with this.",1090886400,27,1024,4.662983425414365

497290,2,6302717612,"Fans of James Garner's excellent work on The Rockford Files will most likely be disappointed with this movie. It has a great cast of fine actors (Garner, Katherine Ross, Peter Lawford,June Allison, Emound O'Brien, to name a few), but the script is so poorly written that everyone practically sleepwalks through their individual roles. Even James Garner, whose natural charm usually made any role entertaining, looks like he'd rather be someplace else. The plot is very hard to follow and riddled with implausibilities. The interaction and relationships between the characters is so rushed that it appears the movie was made under a tight time constraint. Although this was a 1972  theatrical release, it has the look of a poorly done TV movie. A much better bet for Garner fans is his excellent Rockford Files  collection or the movie, Twilight, in which Garner starred with the incomparable Paul Newman.",1418256000,,904,5.142857142857143
497291,2,6302717612,"Lee Schumacher and Karl Miller are credited as the dog trainers for this movie.  Their names appear way at the end,  as the credits roll just when everybody is walking out of the theater to go home.  Their work with animals in this movie is amazing and really deserves to be acknowledged.  I believe both trainers have interesting biographical and technical info on the internet,searchable  under their names, also the name Rudd Weatherwax.

Dogs interact directly with people in this film, as opposed to earlier days of film, when, as we are told, William Powell and Myrna Loy, for example, just let Asta the dog concentrate on commands from the trainer.

The 2-stars in this review refer to the shallowness of the humans in this film. Since other reviews cover the cameo appearances of older stars, I shall not say much.  I was sorry that the cameos dealt almost totally with showing emotion and/or  the effect of alcohol  No brains there.

The plot --freeing a dog falsely accused  of killing his owner and finding out who the murderer is--could have been very interesting.  It was allowed to coast along, however, and became ""nice dogs and murder meet the Dukes of Hazzard""-- something like that..

The best about this movie is that it contradicted its title --They Always Kill Their Masters--and clearly established the Doberman's innocence..

  Hal Holbrook's character, the veterinarian, contributed much that was positive, when he explained the Doberman's ferocious growling when tapped on the nose as  ""a game. He likes it.""""""""""""""""

This will help those of us who think all growling is serious,

Hal Holbrook brought life, intellect, and understanding to his role-- as did Anne Rutherford.  We would watch James Garner regardless of what he does.

If in a thousand years, some archaeologist opens a hidden vault for storing old films ,  I  truly hope this movie isn't the only one looked at.  Doesn't quite say who we are.",1414627200,,1931,4.922360248447205

James Garner [sadly passed away in July of 2014] plays laid-back detective similar in nature to the one he portrayed in Marlow (1966), in a sleepy coastal California town, where everyone knows each other by their first name, well almost everyone.  Katherine Ross is the beautiful veterinarian helping him solve the mysterious murder involving a dog by the name Murphy.

Here is the plot-line in a nutshell: Abel Marsh (James Garner) is pushing his 50's and is a police detective with an attitude of a James Dean.  His next case involves a murdered socialite living on a beach house with her Doberman.  She is found dead on the beach  after being dragged-out of the ocean by her four-leg companion.  Everyone in town believes she was killed by her dog, while detective Abel finds the contrary...investigation ensues and new clues come to shed a light on the killer (or killers).

497365,4,6302717612,"That above sarcastic remark is courtesy of veterinary nurse, Mrs. Kate Bingham (Katharine Ross), and it's directed at the less-than-enthused Chief of Police Abel Marsh (James Garner). Marsh is at the vet on official business, there to show paperwork that'll get a Doberman pinscher put down for killing its owner. I'm guessing it's routine stuff like that, more often than not, that Marsh has dealt with in his years of service in the California coastal town of Eden's Landing.

But there's something about that lovely nurse and her quiet (but pointed) championing of Murphy the Doberman. It makes the chief take a pause. It makes him take a closer look. And it turns out, the woman didn't die by way of Doberman. She was drowned. And now Chief Marsh suspects something foul.

In plenty of ways, 1972's THEY ONLY KILL THEIR MASTERS reminds one of a television movie. The production values weren't exactly top caliber. In fact, no sooner were the scenes completed than the lot cast and crew were on was shut down by MGM, and for good. There is, surprisingly, an element of racy stuff going down in the narrative (four words: promiscuous, dead, pregnant 1esbian). And it's not the bit where the sleepy tiny town is rocked by a steamy scandal. No, that's actually par for the course in these murder mysteries. What had some viewers harrumphing when this movie was first released was that June Allyson, who has a supporting role here, played a decidedly unfamiliar role.

I don't think there ever was a movie with James Garner in it that I didn't like. He's simply very likable and seems so down-to-earth. As Abel Marsh, he exudes his patented laid-back charm and a worldweariness and maybe even a certain air of superiority over them bustling city folk. One look at Garner and you don't doubt that the man has smarts. He makes it look so easy. It's a pleasure watching him interact with his cast. Not too long after this, Garner would embark on the fabulous television series, THE ROCKFORD FILES. And Chief Marsh and Jim Rockford share many characteristics. They're both sharp as a tack and cool as the other side of the pillow.

The grind-it-out procedural feel is another thing that likens the movie to a television show. Sort of offsetting that is the joy in watching a supporting cast heftily composed of classic film stars. Marsh, in the course of his investigation, runs into characters played by June Allyson, Peter Lawford, Ann Rutherford, Edmond O'Brien, and Tom Ewell. But if you're not into old, familiar faces or small town sleaze, then see this, anyway, for Garner's self-assured performance, for a very good, very comely Katharine Ross, for that cute (and sometimes scary) Doberman, and for them touches of humor, most of which come by way of amusing observations on the daily grind of a small town policeman.",1382400000,3,2820,4.820247933884297

The rest of the movie was only fair - a little dated concerning gays.

Had major stars - at the time - in cameo. A real hoot. Tom Ewell reallly fat, Ednond O'brian funny, Peter Lawford pathetic. The ultimate bad person was a well known star at the time with about a minute of screen time.

497424,3,6302717612,"A potentially taut and engrossing murder mystery is bungled by a flabby script with unneeded small town ""humor"" inserted into the proceedings, not to mention a disturbing undercurrent of homophobia. When a woman's body is found mutilated on a beach, her Doberman is thought to have turned on her and killed her. When an autopsy shows she was murdered, a small town cop (James Garner) must sift through the victim's secret and unconventional life to find her killer. Outside of the provocative (for 1972), lesbian angle and the smutty innuendos, this could have been a TV movie. Cast includes Katharine Ross, June Allyson (very good in her one big scene), Peter Lawford, Tom Ewell, Hal Holbrook, Ann Rutherford and Arthur O'Connell.

The Warners Archive MOD DVD is a decent wide screen (1.85) transfer.",1317686400,,801,5.022556390977444
497425,4,6302717612,"I just watched the Warner Archive Dvd version of They Only Kill Their Masters. It stars James Garner. It was made in the 70's and is a gem
I will not go into plots or bore you with a synopsis. I will tell you that it is a fun movie. With a stellar cast. Edmund Obrien,Peter Lawford and Harry Gaurdino just to name a few. The story is well plotted so you do not get bored while watching.
Garner is the star and does well in carrying the movie. it is great to see him in something that did not just having him survive on his charm. It was this movie that had me actually start to check out other Garner films.
I recommend this movie for mystery buffs and Garner fans. It is a bit steep in price so be willing to shop around.",1309996800,8,722,3.986206896551724
