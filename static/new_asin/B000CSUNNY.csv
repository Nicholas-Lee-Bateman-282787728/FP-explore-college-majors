2473609,1,B000CSUNNY,"You've got to be kidding me!!! There is NO WAY anyone could've given this trash movie a 5 star rating unless they're somehow connected to this movie!! From the first scene, I was dumbfounded that anyone would spend their time or money (My bad!!) on this turkey!
DUMPSTER BABY is a joke. The ""actors"" are all atrocious, the story worse than atrocious... I watched 22 minutes of this and could not make myself sit through another second! I'm speechless this is so bad.",1442620800,2,466,4.626506024096385
2473610,5,B000CSUNNY,"Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, A Streetcar Named Desire, all of these supposed ""classic films"" are mere steaming piles of refuse when seen through the eyes of one who has had the privilege to behold the glory that is Dumpster Baby. I had once thought that my high standards and expectations when viewing a film would never allow me to walk away truly satisfied at movies' end. This one has single handedly proven me wrong. The other reviews of this movie mention that the film is ""convoluted"" and ""a waste of time"". These viewers simply can't comprehend pure greatness or undestand the underlying vision that drives a true cinematic genius when he masters his craft. Dumpster Baby is the apex of film; without this movie the world would be a much more dismal place. Thank you Dumpster Baby. Thank you.",1256860800,9,804,4.709219858156028
2473611,1,B000CSUNNY,"So, I love Troma...Love it, with all my heart but why did they stamp their endorsement on this? It's an inspection of a series of twisted individuals who get their hands on this dumpster baby throughout the movie, a metaphor to the corrupton of our society....that's quite the lofty goal but the result is pure garbage. I hate it so much I needed to rub ajax on my eyes with steel wool.

Stick with Toxie, SGT Kabukiman NYPD, Nukem High, Tromeo and Juliet, Troma War, Terror Firmer, and Poultrygeist (Those are all the ones I've liked best, but there's a few more I haven't seen)",1232496000,5,579,4.514285714285714
2473612,5,B000CSUNNY,"Okay, first things first. The acting is not good, and thats severely understating. The sound quality is very quiet (i watched it on my computer with headphones, and even then some of it was hard to understand). The fact that this movie is low budget is extremely obvious. However, I'm giving it five stars, because its creators came up with an amazing idea for a movie and did the best they could with what they had.

This is not a movie about a killer baby like one might assume. It's about a baby that gets thrown away like a piece a trash, and is then carried from person to person in a series of seemingly-unconnected vignettes. Vignettes that are royally messed up. In this sense, the movie is never boring, and no scene overstays its welcome. The city in which Dumpster Baby resides is truly vile, something of a stark metaphor for the world we live in. And something HAS to be said about the ending. Completely unexpected and very disturbing.

Clearly this movie isn't for everyone, and I'll refrain from calling it anything other than 'powerful.' It's thought-provoking, and would probably make for an amazing novel. See it for the story and the imagery, forgive the sound and the acting.",1232409600,6,1196,4.6635071090047395
2473613,1,B000CSUNNY,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!!  No story line, lack of character development, no plot, and terrible acting.  Sound quality poor at best which further complicates understanding what is going on in the film.  The entire film makes no sense; the cover of the box is the most amusing aspect of this film.  Do not waste your time or money.",1227484800,4,334,4.807017543859649
2473614,1,B000CSUNNY,"Im a huge Troma fan, but this is one of the movies that Troma released under its companies name, and its complete garbage!, They don't even show the baby! its just a doll or something wrapped in a blanket. The whole movie is all dialog and no funny parts,after it was done i through it against my wall. If your looking for the typical funny Troma movies, this is not one of them.",1211846400,6,379,4.205479452054795
2473615,4,B000CSUNNY,"Brilliantly uncomfortable.

An unwanted baby that is disposed of by placing it in a dumpster is a superb metaphor for the kind of world most kids are born into these days. As we follow the baby through various circumstances as it goes from hand to hand, we see more and more of this dumpster of a world we live in.

This film is dark, depressing and uses a palette that beautifully illustrates it's story and message. It is made on a low budget, but Dumpster Baby is one of those movies that show that not only no unlimited amount of money is needed to make a great film, but that the lack of it actually adds to the gritty atmosphere it wants to capture (a message maestro Mario Bava already understood perfectly, often handing films in under budget, because not all of the cash was needed to make a fine product). No CGI-effects could ever recreate this kind of realism. I have read about the bad sound the film is supposed to have. OK, admitted, it is not quite 5-channel ultra-dolby mix that we get here, but as with the murky atmosophere that the cameras captured so magnificently, the sometimes hard to follow mumblings the people speak to each other add a fitting non-communicational loneliness to the lives of those we follow.

Highly original, extremely hard-hitting and rather uncomfortable. In other words: a poetic masterpiece, a must-see and a must-have.",1157414400,14,1367,4.6875
