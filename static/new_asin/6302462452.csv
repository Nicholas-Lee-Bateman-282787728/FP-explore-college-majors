This film dives deep into each and every soul and will take your breath away.",973468800,10,245,4.926829268292683
467622,5,6302462452,"I first saw this feature in the West Yellowstone IMAX theatre and I was moved and blown away.  The soundtrack is excellent!  The footage is breathtaking! As one who is passionate on Wolf conservation, Yellowstone, Bison preservation, and Ecology, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys wild life, especially Wolves.",973296000,11,325,5.230769230769231
467623,1,6302462452,"Poor image quality (the only Imax movie I know with  ""thumbnails""), poorest sound of my collection, uninteresting  story. I've never seen the end of it. For good Digital 5.1 sound, better  try ""ALASKA"", and for sharp image quality, try ""Mysteries of  Egypt""",965260800,6,257,5.0476190476190474
467624,5,6302462452,"This is a GREAT documentary on Wolves. I've seen most others IMAX films and this one ranks in a tie at the top (the other is Antartica), what with the scenery, sounds, and the visualization. It's breathtaking to watch the  interaction between the pups and the adults. There are helicopter shots  that puts you right in the midst of the pack, as well as ground cameras  stationed at strategic locations to make you want to reach out and touch  the wolves. Another excellent part of this DVD is the added documentary on  the main wolves and how the wolves were raised in an environment that  reflects their own habitat. After viewing this DVD, I signed up to be an  active member in bringing back the wolves. If you collect any of the Imax  films, this is a must to have - you will not be disappointed.",962841600,33,800,4.431506849315069

467723,5,6302462452,Very well done and clears up a lot of misconceptions of the wolf.  Totally enjoyed it and very thankful for the Nez Perce people for using their traditional ways to help bring the natural world in the harmony that has been place so out of whack by humans.,1416700800,,255,4.3125
467724,3,6302462452,Bought this as a gift for someone who's into wolves and we watched it together. She loved it but personally I didn't think it's up to the usual IMAX standards.,1412726400,,159,4.333333333333333

467787,4,6302462452,"This is an excellent educational piece concerning not just wolves, but their relationship with humans. There is less biology than a scientific documentary, but more history and anecdotes of the interactions between wolves and humans both in the past and moving forward. If you are looking for a biological or ecological analysis, this is not what you want. This is more concerned with the wolves place in the modern world and coexistence with humans, which is just as important and interesting in it's own right.",1408320000,,512,5.035294117647059

467790,3,6302462452,"Found the video and audio quality of the DVD not as good as expected. The soundtrack music was rather loud, making it sometimes  difficult to hear what was being said.  I liked the extra feature about the Yellowstone Wolves, but it was not easily found under the menu items of the DVD.  Almost missed it. Did love the story of how wolves are now back in the United States after having been needlessly slaughtered and nearly wiped out.  I don't have a Blu-ray player, so gave that disc to my grandchildren. Again, I would have expected the quality of that disc to be better than it was. They did enjoy learning about what happened to wolves and how things have now been changed for the better for them.  Also, couldn't beat the price paid for this twosome.",1393113600,,755,4.481751824817518

467792,2,6302462452,"I purchased this item expecting a documentary that featured wolves and lots of them. However the documentary strays from it's premise. In certain segments, if someone walked in the room and did not know what the documentary was about, would never guess it was about wolves. Very disappointing is all I can say about this documentary.",1364947200,7,333,4.964285714285714
467793,5,6302462452,WAS A WONDERFUL BLU RAY ON WOLVES. COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT LONGER BUT I LOVED SEEING THEM ALTHOUGH I DID FAST FORWARD THROUGH THE RANCHER JUNK CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THEM OR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY! THEY CAN SUCK IT! THE BEAUTY OF THE WOLVES WERE DECENT ENOUGH IN THIS MOVIE. WOULD RECOMMEND FOR ALL WOLF LOVERS!,1360627200,2,317,4.129032258064516
467794,1,6302462452,very very bad i didn't like it at all i know less about wolves than i did before. Even the IMAX cameras couldn't save this tragedy,1360195200,3,130,4.038461538461538
467795,3,6302462452,"Some of this is good, but there seemed to be quite a bit that should have been on the eidtor's floor.  The focus should have been more on the wolves and education about them than some of the other topics that took up time.",1360022400,3,222,4.045454545454546
467796,4,6302462452,"I was very excited to get this film. I love wolves. The film itself plays through great, however the special features skip bad and then do not play. I'm sure its just a flaw with the disc and has nothing to do with how it was handled.",1336262400,3,234,4.0
467855,1,6302462452,"Raising a high content wolf hybrid myself and was looking for additional education on wolves. My 17yr. old watched it by herself,Came out and said it was the stupidest movie she has seen,. I watched it and thought its was a waste of my time, my money and will never watch it again. I recommend ""Living With Wolves"" with the Dutchers.

467856,1,6302462452,"I purchased this DVD based on all the glowing revues but the film was extremely disappointing.
The footage of wolves was not very interesting and the scenery was also not particularly beautiful or dynamically shot.  The music is not inspiring and worst of all, the very short length made me feel like I had been ripped off (although I will say my particular seller made this item a positive experience so I don't want to leave any negative impression on the seller).  I am baffled by the over the top positive revues and wish I had listened to the one negative revue.  Since this was made for IMAX I can understand the short length but most IMAX films I've seen are amazingly beautiful.  This would have been a waste of IMAX time.  I bought this film for research on wolves and after watching it once, can't imagine I will be watching again.  I do appreciate the efforts the film maker is making for conservation of the wolf species but with such a short running time I would have rather been wowed by the species not just preached at.  The film should describe itself as a plea for more conservation, not a thrilling look into the world of wolves.",1284076800,7,1148,4.490384615384615
467857,5,6302462452,"For those who love to follow the history and current issues of the wolves, you will love this DVD. I would also order ""In the Valley of the Wolves"", filmed in Yellowstone Park in 2006. Such extrodinary footage that makes it a must for those who love nature.",1230076800,,257,4.375
467858,4,6302462452,"I liked the production and logic of the documentary. I did not like the format on my TV. Maybe because I have a ""plain"" flat screen TV without high-def ... but the film had a border around it. I have watched other IMAX films without this distraction.

I was disappointed so much time went to historical persecutions of wolves, but that is a dark part of american history: how the settlers/government persecuted Indians, wolves and buffalo to near extinction. One of our national disgraces, really. Not expected on a feature on ""wolves"".

I have to allow for others who may not have been in nature conservation like I was, though.

Maybe this will inspire someone to sponsor a wolf, and learn even more. the program is online, just search on google.

I learned a few things about wolves, which is saying something for someone who studied to be a veterinarian!

Shows how Nez Perce are helping reestablish wolves today.

Worth a look. Not too violent for most kids, though there is footage of a hunter shooting a wolf at close range, in BW film.",1206230400,,1043,4.641304347826087
467859,1,6302462452,"I RECEIVED THIS VIDEO TAPE VERY PROMPTLY, HOWEVER, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE VIDEO ITSELF.

IF I CAN'T SIT THROUGH IT, THEN NEITHER WILL THE KIDS. I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED ANOTHER ONE FROM NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC WHICH IS SUPER.",1175040000,,391,4.764705882352941
467860,2,6302462452,"This is great film at an IMAX theater, but for some reason, when you plug in the DVD, you have this weird smaller square in the middle of the screen showing the movie, surrounded by a still background.  The movie takes up about 2/3 of the screen.  I can't explain it.  I have a regular 42"" Plasmas TV, I don't have the same problem with other DVD's.",1168300800,2,349,4.17910447761194
467861,3,6302462452,And that is the way it was and is intended. Sharing this planet with other persons (we call animals) is essential to our well being. WE are all related and what happens to any spoke in the wheel of life will surely come to impact on the rest of us. This film should be required viewing at an age when opinions on the value of life is being determined.,1124409600,6,351,4.101449275362318
467862,5,6302462452,"Wolves are poorly judged animals. For years they have been hunted down by cause of fear. Now, the wolf is a symbol of what humans have done wrong, and what humans can do to help restore the wildlife.
The year 2000 was the first time I ever got to see WOLVES played on the Imax dome at the Liberty Science Center (LSC). Right from the start, I was so amazed at every little detail. The Native American music was exceptionally good. The movie was so great, I convinced my school to take a field trip back, then saw it once more on my own, and ended up seeing in three times all together. The DVD proves to be just as great, but nothing could compare to the excitement of seeing it from the dome. The movie was well put together. Every moment of it is truly an exciting experiance. Nobody should miss out of a documentary as astonishing as this one.",1044144000,,846,4.260869565217392
467863,4,6302462452,"""Wolves"" is a truly extraordinary look at some of the Yellowstone wolves and up-close portrayal of their complex social interactions. The producers and director did a wonderful job of getting very close to the wolves to bring them into our homes, and hopefully into our hearts, as we realize that these are not the Big Bad Wolves of European myth.
The feature IMAX film itself is, sadly, very short; however, there is a wonderful additional film on the DVD, ""The Survival of the Wolf in Yellowstone"" that's simply outstanding. Narrated and hosted by Matthew Fox, featuring several noted wolf biologists and conservationists, and set largely in Yellowstone itself, this feature closely examines the many sides of wolf reintroduction, and prominently features some of the well-known wolves, most notably Numbers Nine and Ten, and their bittersweet stories.
I definitely recommend watching this film and its accompanying features on the disc, as it will raise awareness of the wolf's struggles during the reintroduction process, and why it's so very important that we allow this magnificent, keystone predator back into its historic ranges.",1030924800,17,1137,5.322222222222222

7826061,3,6302462452,"A better title would be ""Wolves and the Nez Perce Tribe"" ... there is an ample helping of political ideology in this film that promotes the highly-contested issue of wolf re-introduction. I imagine many Idaho cattle and sheep ranchers and people that use to be able to put food on the table with guide service businesses would disagree with the premise of the film.  The videography is very good which is why I gave it 3 stars.",1477785600,,427,4.545454545454546

7826064,1,6302462452,"I was very disappointed with the very poor quality of this DVD.  I've viewed this video many times over the years and not once was it freezing or slowing down while watching on T.V.  I left a comment on May 15th/16 and for some reason it cannot be located.  I've also ordered 3 other products also on May 15th.  I need to return this DVD either to replace with a proper one or a refund.  It certainly was far from an original as it seems it was taped from a multi produced/taped copy.  I have many DVD's but not in this poor quality.  At the time of ordering, I stated I wanted a new copy, not a used one as I did with other items as well as the 3 item order on May 15th.  I haven't read the return policy as yet, but will be doing so, and if there is a problem with returning this ""poor quality and not watchable"" DVD, I will not be ordering again.  These DVD's should be in good quality, not sold as if it has been watching 100's of times to diminish the quality.  It's a short documentary, and it's a shame this terrible copy was in such bad shape.",1463270400,,1051,4.033816425120773
