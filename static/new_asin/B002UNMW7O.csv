3991790,5,B002UNMW7O,"This movie has been getting a lot of backlash from the fans of the first movie. People are saying that ""It wasn't like the first one"" or ""It's ten years too late"". I'm a fan of the first movie and I enjoyed this one immensely. Of course it isn't like the first one, but 10 years too late? Not to me. Duffy gave himself a decade to make a followup to the cult phenomenon and, well, 10 years later, he gave is possibly the greatest sequel to the first movie one could ask for.

Returning to the roles of the insanely badass McManus brothers are Sean Flanery and Norman Reedus, and boy, do they do great here. Also, in place of the lovable Paul Smecker is Julie Benz as Eunice Bloom, a sexy, funny, and smart FBI agent, who, in her words, is ""so f--kin' smart, she makes other smart people feel like they're retarded"" (she stays true to her word!). And also, Billy Connolly as the daddy, Il Duce. But, in place of David Della Rocco is Clifton Collins Jr. as Romeo, a HILARIOUS Mexican dude, whom, believe it or not, tops Rocco by a thousand! And believe me, the cast here is SPECTACULAR! Not a single disappointment.

It is 8 years later. The McManuses are living a quiet life on a farm in Ireland, and the brothers (albeit with hilarious long hair and beards). One night at dinner, a priest comes in and gives them the news: They're in trouble. A Boston priest has just been killed, and the killer had done all he can to make it look like the McManuses are responsible. Upon hearing of this, it's time to shave the beards and cut the hair, and jump on the boat back to Boston. On the boat, they meet Romeo, a hilarious and quirky Mexican dude who is interested in joining them. After a rough patch, he joins them, and the minute they are off the boat, they are a team of three. Their goal is not only to get their names cleared, but to get their revenge on the person who killed the priest.

However, while that is happening, Paul Smecker is gone and has been replaced by Eunice Bloom, a sexy, funny, and undoubtedly quirky FBI agent. Upon her investigation at the crime scene, she comes to the conclusion that the saints did not kill the priest. It was done by a member of the Yakavetta family, who also wants revenge: On the saints, for killing Pappa Joe. However, despite the cops' and Bloom's positions, they decide that they are just as in it to investigate the murder as The Saints, and worlds collide, with more chaos and action you can handle!

I won't give away more, because this movie is simply a must see. Basically, if you liked the first movie, you will like this one a great deal. It has the original brothers, who give great performances, it has tons of action, lots of blood, and is a great time at the cinema for sure. The movie is well paced and well filmed. It is easier to tell that it was shot on a higher budget than the original, which is a good thing, you can see it in the cinematography, you can see it in the effects and everything. In short, if you loved the first movie, go see this movie for sure. Duffy has managed to top the first movie in every way imaginable, which is a bold statement because the first movie was awesome too. But be sure to see this! Oh, and the ending. The ending is AWESOME, with a cameo from someone you may know of!

Violence: 100/10
Laughs: 10/10

3991791,5,B002UNMW7O,Just saw this movie at the theatre tonight and it is by far one of the best movies i've seen in a long time.  The characters have real depth and the dialogue is well written and incredibly witty.  The cast has great chemistry and the story unfolds at a very steady pace.  Speaking of the cast there is certainly one cameo that's in there mostly for the benefit of the Canadian fans of the film (The majority of the crowd would burst into laughter whenever he was shown on the screen) All in all this was an amazing movie with a very memorable ending which better result in a sequel which takes less than 8 years to come out.,1260230400,12,624,4.226890756302521
3991792,5,B002UNMW7O,"I've seen the movie twice on the big screen and will still have to have the DVD for home viewing because the cheers and laughter of my 'frenzied' fellow movie goers drowned out some of the dialogue in places. I refuse to compare this film to the first because it can stand on its own as more than just another action film, it is a work of Art on the screen with all the tragedy, depth, symbolism, brotherly love, witty dialogue, tension, and purpose of one of Shakespeare's plays, only with a modern day twist. There are some scenes that only my 'Chitty-chitty bang bang' and 'Starsky and Hutch' generation may 'get', but that's o.k. Makes me feel special. Clifton Collins Jr. and Julie Benz stole every scene they were in! Rather than attempt to have Benz fill the big shoes of Willem Dafoe, Duffy brilliantly gave us a smart, unique character who stands out in her own high heels. We also are filled in on a glimpse of the back story for Connolly's character as the father; why he became a hit man who preys on mobsters and how he was caught. I felt more sympathy this time around for the father and his losses, as well as a deeper understanding of why the brothers were compelled to take on their mission. Not only is this a great continuation of a fantastic cult classic, it gives the audience a deeper look into the Saints. Of course I must add that Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr.) is one of those unforgettable characters who brought the humor to the forefront. I might add that the music was great. Hope to see the soundtrack on sale soon.

sometimes an extra 10 minutes doesn't seem to make sense. this time it does. I'm surprised how much the few extra minutes really added to the flick. enjoyed saints 1 and 2 a lot. like it even better than before. a back catalog library must have",1523059200,,267,4.36
3991794,2,B002UNMW7O,Barely watchable... Loved the first movie. Parts of it were downright insulting. Story was tenuous at best. Acting was sub par in my opinion.

It seemed like the story was thrown together in 10 minutes, the humor was low class and tried too hard to be funny yet action filled, new characters were awful, and choosing a ""sexy"" new FBI agent helping the ""Saints"" was just a sad attempt to draw more people to watch it.

3991893,2,B002UNMW7O,"This one fell flat compared to the first one.  The pace was slow, and without DeFoe, a lot of the humor was gone.  The first movie was a quirky and original mix of violence and comedy, especially with DeFoe's very original gay character and how he played it.  The actions scenes in the first movie were brilliant because we saw the aftermath first, and THEN how it was done.  They were also quirky and original, like throwing the toilet out the window after the police speculated that a giant had stomped the victims.  In the first movie the action scenes were much closer together, and of course the premise unfolded as the movie went on.  The second one, like so many squeals didn't  know how to bring something original to the story.  Even the action scenes seemed typical and routine.  So the things that made the first movie a five star, were missing from this one. I turned it off halfway through.",1485388800,,903,4.5246913580246915

3991900,5,B002UNMW7O,"Although this is a ""showy"" second movie...if you love the first, you'll probably love the second, too.  Sure....it tries too hard to be bad-ass.  And some of the characters are over-the-top.  But the story is still there.  And what this sequel loses in ""unnecessary drama and overacting"" in the earlier portion of the movie, it really makes up for in the final showdown, which takes the most important and original characters and draws their stories to a close in a compelling fashion considering the odd nature of the Boondock Saints' stories.  I already own this movie on DVD and STILL paid to rent it because I love seeing it over and over and am too lazy to find some sort of ancient device laying about to play a DVD.  If you're a true fan of the Boondock Saints, you will love this movie for different reasons than you loved the first.  But with the same amount of adoration.  These movies are ""excellent"" in a fun way mostly because of the *largely* excellent cast and *always* impressive endings.  With the added humor and the ability to see these guys as both heroes and villains at the same time....the sequel gives you just as much *pause* as to what you're ""rooting for"" as the original Saints.  I love it.",1484784000,4,1218,4.571428571428571

If you believe in justice, I mean true justice and not this mamby pamby garbage the courts hand down with a slap on the wrist and a lawyer getting someone off only to have scum back out on the street, then you may enjoy these movies.

The new FBI detective Eunice Bloom is terrible. Overdone cartoonish southern accent and a confusion as to whether she wants to be tough and smart or some silly southern debutante, she clings to every man next to her as if needing his support. I could go on, I won't. Better to have left it alone than turn it into a farce. Thin and rather lame plot. Weak backstory flashbacks of their Dad's Batman moment and transformation to revenge killer. And a hairy man in a pink Speedo NO ONE should ever have to see. You can't un-see something like that. Save yourself now.",1474329600,3,736,4.419117647058823

3992073,4,B002UNMW7O,"Boondock Saints is without question, a top-ten cult classic.  The sequel, although done much later than most (9-10 yrs), retained so much of the heroism, and energy by the 2 leads, it too, falls in the top ten list.  What makes it great is having a fully developed plot that stands on its own, yet manages to retain the core aspect of ""good-guy"" spiritually right, McManus brothers.  Some new characters introduced held their own, and in all honesty, if the writer/producer wish, a third film could retain its glory today.
Now, understand my top 10 list includes Ferris Beuhler, Resevoir Dogs, Saving Private Ryan, Fargo, Out of Sight, etc.",1454457600,,640,4.853211009174312

I actually hated it the first time I watched it, then I watched it again and started to think about it differently, like its a comic book or a TV show, its just another episode, then I realized I did like it, a lot- but not as MUCH as the first, and I still have hopes for the third one. Is it Oscar material? NO. Did it entertain me and have I watched it like 20 times since I bought it, YES! Hope the third one which supposedly is green-lighted is good and that they get it made without more delays. Still not for everyone, suspension of disbelief in some scenes in both movies, but they are not documentaries, they are supposed to be entertainment, if your taking it too seriously then maybe your taking it too seriously and you will find your cup of tee elsewhere.",1448236800,,876,4.158823529411765

The film should have spent more time on the dynamic and interaction between the two MacManus brothers.  Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are awesome as the brothers/Saints, so they should be in pretty much every scene!  I enjoyed the movie when the scenes contained the brothers.  I hope that the upcoming third film focuses more on them, gives them more screen time, and delivers something closer to the classic first movie.",1439596800,,579,4.75

3992142,1,B002UNMW7O,"I recently bought and watched the first one. I instantly fell in love with it and was sucked into the movie. I then immediately bought the second one and watched it, much to my dismay.

Within just the first few minutes of starting the movie I already had a strange uncomfortable feeling that something wasn't right. The editing, direction and story seemed forced and shallow. It felt like it was someone trying hard to copy & paste the first one.

The characters in this movie which were in the first one felt like shells of their former selves, and many with new ties and relationships to the saints that made no sense from the events of the last movie. Even worse than that were the new characters, who were so horribly written and overacted that I got a headache from scenes they were in (especially the female detective, who's character was there to replace William Dafoe's from the first one).

What is worst of all is that almost all of the dialogue and most of the acting (sadly even from the saints themselves) was uncomfortably awkward and bad, and I do mean uncomfortably. I had to force myself to get through this movie just so I could give and honest review.",1434240000,2,1171,4.540284360189573
3992143,3,B002UNMW7O,Good sequel. Unfortunately the female lead (Julie Benz) made the movie painful to watch at times with her horrible southern accent and atrocious attempt at acting .  Other than that it would have been a five star.  Also the guy that played their side kick named Romeo doesn't hold a candle to Rocco.  Still not to bad again other than the female choice for lead.,1434153600,,362,4.538461538461538

I went into it knowing it wouldn't be as good as the first movie. Understand that so few sequals live up to any first movie in a series, godfather 2 excluded. Yea they reach for some jokes but they did that in the first one too. More character development equates to a better overall story. Again I'd say about 1/3 of the movie is a reach. The other 2/3's aren't bad if you understand that it's not the first movie",1433808000,,558,4.081818181818182

3992182,4,B002UNMW7O,"Like most of the previous reviewers I really loved the first Boondock Saints movie and I picked up this volume 2 at a bargain price.  Even though I did like the first one better, I still enjoyed viewing this well done sequel.  The MacManus brothers (Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery) do another fantastic job of revenge assassinations after they hear a beloved priest has been killed.  They were living in  peace in Ireland at the time, but they quickly end up in the U.S. to avenge the murder of the priest.  I just love their unique guns as they hunt for their enemies.

All the characters in this film are memorable, especially Julia Benz who plays a sharp FBI agent on the trail of the McManus  brothers.  If you liked the first Boondock Saints movie you should check out this sequel.  I found it a fun ride.

I am a HUGE Boondock Saints fan, and I have started collecting extra copies to share with newbies.

Be sure to watch the first one, so you will catch some great references to the first movie.

Violent, but justified.  Rough language that gives the movie a realistic atmosphere, and, of course- the Luck of the Irish gets them through the. Rough spots!",1407196800,,434,4.8108108108108105

I tuned out when the fake mexican guy gave the brothers a ride in his Beetle and they started making ""jokes""... maybe that should have been a spoiler alert, but it's not a spoiler if you don't watch the movie - and you shouldn't.

The humor is forced and unnatural, chemistry (other than between the brothers) completely non-existent, and most of the intended laugh moments are of the form ""[Character A says something vaguely off-color or offensive]"", ""[Character B tops it]"",
""[Characters A and B laugh like hyenas and shoot something]"".

There wasn't enough of the brothers that drove the story in the first film. It almost seemed they tried to create a movie around the mythology of the Saints without actually having to use them. When they did show up, it was almost anticlimactic as you knew that they were eventually going to be caught (this time).

I would have rather seen the Saints slip away again, as they did in the first film, to leave it open for a third one (unlikely, however). While I bought it once to say I completed both films, I wouldn't buy the second film again (the first one, on the other hand, I would watch over and over!).",1392768000,,800,4.256578947368421

While having the same key actors the story line, cinematography, acting and directing all left me wanting.

3992376,5,B002UNMW7O,"This movie was fantastic! I mean, the first was much better, but the second was just hilarious! There was so much humor in it, and the actors definitely brought it back to make another hit!",1390608000,,189,4.428571428571429
3992377,3,B002UNMW7O,"There were three primary things I found off-putting about this movie:
- Too long:  I like me some long movies when it is appropriate, but this movie stretched on a good 30 minutes longer than it needed.  Part of the reason was that the director really tried to dramatize things in this movie by slowing action down when it just wasn't necessary and added little of value
- Tried too hard:  Julie Benz's southern accent wasn't very good, and given that she's not southern, it wasn't necessary.  The screenplay took all the fun and novel stuff that made the first movie what it was, and just duplicated it, over and over, but this time with a bigger movie budget (see point #3 below).  Plot points that were supposed to try and anchor this in Boston were forced just to make the point that it takes place in Boston.
- Lack of originality:  The first movie was authentic and genuine.  This movie had very little in the story that developed organically.  It was clear that the writers just took the successful aspects of the first movie and rehashed it (law enforcement listening to music, analyzing a crime scene, and saying ""here's what happened""; showing how a planned hit would take place in the minds of the McManus brothers, and then showing how it really unfolded, complete with the quirks and mistakes and yet it all turns out ok; a fast talking high energy sidekick; the point in the movie where the fathers entrance is uber-dramatic; the local cops trying to defend their turf against a federal FBI agent who is obviously more skilled, etc)

All that being said, it was not a waste of time.  I liked the first movie, and this was worth a single viewing, but I doubt I'll ever get struck with the urge to watch it again.  If I'm going to watch a movie where I know what happens, I will rewatch the first one where the story itself was more organic.",1390608000,,1853,4.501492537313433

3992379,3,B002UNMW7O,"Really liked the first movie and better cast as well.
Like all sequels, trying to create the same magic as the original is difficult. This movie is no different. A couple of the scenes tried to mimic the slow moving action sequences of the first which was fine but not terribly original anymore since so many movies have repeated the formula (see matrix, et al.).
 What this movies suffers mostly from is a lack of plot.
Characters are great though.",1390348800,,449,4.6125
3992380,5,B002UNMW7O,"while most sequels or '2' movies do not hold up this one does way better than average.  If you liked the first one you will like this one.

Thank you. Also the other company that sent the wrong region was awesome. They refunded my money and let me keep the movie which I gave to my cousin who live in The UK region 2 and has never seen either movie, but has worked with one of the actors Norman Reedus.

3992403,1,B002UNMW7O,The first had humor but was primarily a serious and unique action movie. It was a huge success when it was put out on DVD and became a cult hit. This time around everything ridiculous about the first movie was given a shot of steroids and it is nothing but a caricature of the original. The secondary characters are either complete idiots or tools used to deliver the laziest one liners I've ever seen in a movie. This movie should ONLY appeal to 13 year old males.

Different look and feel in a lot of ways buit if you go in with the belief that you are willing to see a different movie and not a continuation of the exact same one, you might really love this also.  Give the chick a chance, cuz she really can do the bad A$$ really well.
Full of inside jokes and nods to the fans this is every bit as good as the first.  The extras are also fantastic and if you have seen my reviews before, I love really good extras.  I have made some friends promos to give it 20 minutes and by the end of that 20 minutes, I could put down my guns and we could all enjoy the rest of the film.",1384819200,3,812,3.7810650887573964

3992415,4,B002UNMW7O,"The original Boondock Saints movie is among my favorites. I had purchased this sequel some time ago and, although it is quite different from the original, when it was lost to a friend I purchased this copy to replace it. I have purchased Blu-ray versions of a few movies I had on DVD but this is the first time I ever purchased a second copy of the same film. (Doesn't ""film"" and ""tape"" seem quaint?)",1381190400,,400,4.346666666666667
3992416,5,B002UNMW7O,"Before I bought this movie, I was wondering why it got so many 3, 2 and 1 star reviews. I guess I see where they're coming from now. It definitely doesn't have the same feel as the first movie. It feels a little scripted, a little forced, a little cheesy, the music doesn't fit, the female FBI agent is fairly annoying... That being said, you may ask 'Why 5 stars?'. Well, I really wanted to love it but, the first third of the movie, I really wasn't feeling it. It was like a bad B-movie and not in a good, cult classic kind of way. The second third of the movie hit its stride and really got me laughing! The drinking scene with F*** A** (Can't swear in the reviews, even though it's kinda the guys name...) is hilarious! ""Shut up! Romeo's cryin'."" gets me every time! And when Greenly listened to 'Sister Christian', I almost peed myself laughing! Then, the final third, a main character dies and the boys have a dream about Rocco and I cried... Hard... Then, another character dies and I cried all the way through until the end. So, yes, the movie tries a little too hard to recapture the feel of the first movie and draws painfully obvious parallels (-Yakavetta Jr. incorrectly pronouncing words like Dolly.
-Pretending to shoot Romeo like they did with Rocco in the Russians hotel room.
-Fighting in the crate like they did in the ducts.
-Greenly and his breath spray.
-Bloom's earplugs like Smecker's music.
-The whole rope situation...) but, if you can just let go of your expectations and watch the movie for what it is (Everyone from the first movie getting together 10 years later to reminisce, have fun and make a cheesy sequel.) you should enjoy it. It took a few minutes but, it definitely grew on me and is now one of my favorites!",1380067200,2,1746,4.476489028213166
3992417,5,B002UNMW7O,"As far as sequels go they usually only touch briefly on the previous story.

3992437,4,B002UNMW7O,"Perhaps Duffy only has one good idea in him, expressed so well in Boondock Saints. B.S. II reimagines the same idea and achieves 80% of the first.

Problems: Eunice mimics Smecker (there's really no point to repeating Smecker, why not give her new and unique quirks?), Sean Patrick Flanery either kept up his loading dose of creatine too long or is owed compensation for bad plastic surgery, and the beards and hair are horrendously phony.

Apart from that, Rocco's replacement, Romeo, is excellent. The penultimate scene with the Old Man sitting coolly while destruction rains around him is iconic. The humor is unique to the director, apropos, and timely.

Having watched the documentary about the director's life during and after Boondock Saints' release, I feared he had not only no more ideas in him but that the original Boondock Saints was so well done despite his apparent issues. Glad that wasn't the case. f

Since they dug into the past to fuel this film's characters' motivations, it would be interesting to go forward with middle-aged brothers now perhaps with twins of their own. This movie lacked the drama the first had built of sibling love and loyalty. A third might bring it back with their own familial devotion as motivation.

Along for the ride is a detective who has similar ""artistic"" attributes as the original detective in the Boondock Saints original. For me this movie was slow paced and a challenge to keep up to because you didn't know what was different. On the plus side it had a few of the same actors as the ones that were in the original.

I must say that this movie has the same amount of action as the first one. It also has almost all of the original characters from the first movie in it which is something seeing as how this movie came out nearly 10 years after the first one.  The only thing that really bothered me was that the movie just seemed ""generic"". From the cheesy lines, the goofy Hispanic man (who I assume is taking the role of Rocko from the first movie), to the way they have the FBI agent (who is a woman) acting just like the male FBI agent in the first one.  I think if they just made another movie without trying to tie every single little thing to the first movie, it would've been ok.

I remember my giddy excitement. I also remember the state of denial that I was in after watching this movie in its theatrical release. It was as if an old friend had breathed his last, and my brain refused to accept the concept that he was being put six feet under before my very eyes, refused to believe that the dirt being piled upon it was real, that his flesh would become food for the worms and (a bright side) fertilizer for the soil. This movie broke my heart. They say that time heals all wounds, and indeed, a sufficient amount of time has passed and my mind has been able to accept the fact that this movie absolutely blows and has destroyed a piece of my innocence that I will never recover, but even thinking about this movie is like tearing open a scab, and the wound bleeds anew.

3992478,5,B002UNMW7O,"After three years and a bunch negative feedback, I finally got around to watching the sequel to my all-time favorite movie. Took me long enough because I feared that it would ruin the first one for me --- much like ""The Hangover II"" did for ""The Hangover"" for me. But I finally decided to form my own opinion.

The first 30 minutes thru it I was sighing, feeling that that is exactly what it would be --- another crappy sequel milking the same buck twice. We got a sexy, southern belle to replace the coolest gay guy ever(I've noticed that only severe homophobes hate the original lol)and a new Mexican Comic-relief named Romeo to replace the original Italian Rocco. Rocco, Romeo, Ro--o ----- sigh ....

Then it takes a twist at around minute 31!

In my opinion, Troy Duffy set out to make his sequel SEEM predictable at first to keep it unpredictable!

If you love ""The Boondocks Saints"" as much as I, then you MUST watch the follow-up (I feel ""follow-up"" is a more apropriate word then just ""sequel""). This movie was exactly what I expected it to be three years ago --- not better than the original but still a great movie ---- And I was pleasantly surprised to find it far better than I had heard!

I have to truly wonder if all the haters actually watched the movie from beginning to end???

Here's an excerpt of one of the best quotes I've ever heard in ANY movie ---- and it's from Boondock Saints 2!: ""Real men hide their feelings. Why? BECAUSE IT'S NONE OF YOUR F-----G BUSINESS!! Men do not cry, men do not pout, men jack you in the f-----g jaw and say ... 'Thanks for coming out!'""

3992481,2,B002UNMW7O,"The risk of this franchise falling flat on its face was high.  For one it has been too long since the original came out and second the cast has moved on from that period of their lives and careers.  Add that to the writing/directing/producing behind the project and it was a recipe for a let down.  That being said, it was better then I had expected but fall short of continuing the story of the first movie meaningfully.

The acting was flat, the jokes were old, the cliches were over a decade old, and the situations setting up the plot had too many holes.  The movie did do a good job in going over the back story of el Duce but spent too much time on it and not enough time on what the brothers were doing between the movies, or how they fared with their calling going silent after the mission was over.  The new characters were too shallow and at times reaching to mimic their original castings so their story colors were muted and stale.

Still the movie was entertaining, had some really funny moments and strung along the narrative in a better manner then today's Hollywood reliance of reboots, formulated sequels, and conceptual adaptations.  There were far less shocking or hilarious moments in this movie from the original but it was better then nothing.  There were plenty of tie-ins with the first movie and nods to past characters that worked well and made the movie more comfortable for a fan of the first, but it just felt like there could have and should have been more, more passion, more humor, more vigilantism, more consequences, more seriousness.

Ladies, the two lead characters - Connor and Murphy MacManus played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus - are drop-dead gorgeous, irreverent, funny, have an excellent - and typical - relationship, and everything else positive.

Guys (and gals like me who enjoy it) there is plenty of gun ""play"", a lot of action.

It's said they didn't know each other before the first movie.  You'll find it very hard to believe when you see the camaraderie between these guys.

Some like I better than II and some like II better than I.  I love them both and I can't watch one without also watching the other.  My son will typically fall asleep before we're through both of them.

There are a lot of little things in the first one (I haven't noticed too much in II yet) that were obviously crew mistakes but they're still fun to watch, especially when those little mistakes cause extra skin to show such as when Connor's position changes frequently when he's out cold in the alley.  VERY nice views there. ;)  That entire scene is such a blast (not just because of SPF's skin shots).  I'll rewind and watch it again because I love watching Connor jump down (I know, it's a stunt guy), watching Murphy (Norman Reedus) run around gathering everything while that excellent score is playing, and then hefting Connor up to carry him out of the alley.

After a 10-year hiatus from filmmaking, and with the mortgage on his house due, Troy Duffy turned to art to exploit his only cinematic achievement for money.

Way too long of a runtime for a flick like this, the borderline ridiculous film sucks up tons of time doing flashbacks and random scenes with a character from the first film Rocco. Not to mention the use of a quirky confusing character to replace him. The film is really so much of a mess you might possibly even know less about the Saints after watching it.

There is comedy, violence, human error, very colorful characters,  religious beliefs, a look at media power and much food for thought and discussion. This is not a film for younger kids, but it's a treat for older kids and adults.

3992564,5,B002UNMW7O,"One of the problems with reviews is telling how much you like or dislike, and why, without giving away too much of the plot. I've got BOONDOCK SAINTS I and II, and both are excellent. The acting, the occasional humor, the action and the script for both these very underated movies is just wonderful.

SPOILER: If you haven't seen BOONDOCK SAINTS (the first movie, please don't go any farther but go ahead and buy it, rent it, whatever - you won't be sorry. You really do need to see the first one, though, to understand and appreciate in total the second one.)

Basic plot: Two Irish brothers, through a kind of vision from God, become a sort of modern day Robin Hoods, going after the nastier criminal element of Boston. In BS II, they are in Ireland and a death of a priest, done as a message to them, brings them back to town with a new sidekick and the fun begins again. The wonderful Willem Defoe is in the first movie. His replacement, Julie Benz, was such a shock that it took a couple of viewings for me to really appreciate her. Both she and Defoe are FBI agents in the most bizaare context. I have no other way to put that. The brothers, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are perfect for the roles, as is their father, played by Billy Connolly. I've heard talk of a third movie being made but if so, it isn't in production yet.

While I don't really care to talk about two movies in one review, it is necessary in this case. See the original, then get this one, too. Seriously, you won't regret either.",1326844800,,1517,4.353356890459364

3992569,3,B002UNMW7O,"In ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day,"" the sequel to the original ""Boondock Saints"" from 2000, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus play two scripture-spouting vigilantes in Ireland who return to the states - where they have achieved near-folk hero status - after a priest friend of theirs is murdered to make them look like the killers (the shots to the back of the head and the pennies left on the eyelids being the hallmark of the boys' work).  You see, eight years back, the boys took out a number of Boston mobsters and now the latter are trying to smoke the killers out to get their revenge.  The brothers are joined in their endeavors by a dimwitted, lachrymose sidekick named Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr.), whom they meet on their trans-Atlantic voyage, while an icy-cool FBI agent (delightfully played by Julie Benz) and a bevy of bumbling, corrupt law enforcement officials work on solving the case.

This odd little mixture of smart-alecky humor, stylized, cartoonish violence, and crime movie melodrama is often more ""clever"" than it is funny, with its concepts and intentions often out-performing its execution, coming dangerously close at times to being Tarantino-Lite.  Still, there's enough style in writer/director Troy Duffy's hurdy-gurdy, postmodern spin on the genre to make the movie eminently entertaining and watchable.  And the arch performances delivered by a large and gifted cast - including Billy Connolly and Peter Fonda as two-long term enemies and rivals - add to the spirit of fun.

It doesn't really amount to a whole lot in the long run, and it's never quite as fun as it thinks it's being, but ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" does have its entertaining  moments.",1316390400,,1712,4.985964912280702

If you've seen the first, you've got to see this one. OK, it's not the same as the original Boondock Saints.

We got everybody back and they even let a girl into the boys club. Trust me guys, she earns her stripes. And the ending will have you begging for the last installment.
All Saints Day is definitely worth the buy, even if only for the special features. Commentaries with the main actors, a behind the scenes video thats better than any I've seen recently, deleted scenes and oh so much more.

All Saints Day was a dissappointment to watch. The main storyline was good but is ruined by the director trying to copy his original movie style. The movie starts off with Rocco speaking a character who died in the first, he only appears in one other part of the movie going on a sensless rant that makes no connection to the movie at all. I feel he should have been cut out since they didn't find good parts to fit him in with or have connor and Murphey speaking to him more. They added a new character to take over Rocco's place as ""The Funnyman"" but the character could not come close to the bar set in the first movie. They also tried to replace the detective from the first one which they should not have done. The comedy was slapstick brainless humor like a man getting slapped with meat, the villian wearing headgear or a man in a pink speedo. To make this movie good: 1)cut out the lost characters instead of trying to replace them with a character trying to be identical 2) cut out the brainless humor, since the humor of the first one would be hard to repeat make this movie more serious.",1303430400,2,1238,4.3405172413793105

The ending to the first gave the impression that they would continue on as the vengeful voice of the people who are fed up with crime bosses getting away with anything. Only to find out in the sequel that they RAN AWAY right after that public spectacle of vigilantism?? It made no sense!
There were a LOT of things that just reminded me of the first movie only not as well done (the idiotic side kick, the FBI agent ally, the moronic Boston cops).
The only thing I think this movie stayed true to is the relationship between the brothers. Their loyalty and affection for each other above all is remarkable. Also, their constant bickering which causes problems for the characters generally leads to huge laughs for the audience.
Another thing I couldn't help but notice was that Sean Patrick Flanery has not aged well. Each time they gave him full face shot I couldn't help but think of the Santa Claus movie where Tim Allen gets puffy cheeks and a beard to become Santa- SPF looked like he was undergoing the same change! Yes, I understand people change as they age but Norman Reedus didn't seem to have the same problem.
I do not know the process of how this second Boondock Saints movie came about but I think they could've done without! The first movie was perfect. The sequel kinda ruins the mythology a bit. And although I thought it was very interesting to learn how their family got started on their path I do think they spent WAY too much time on the back story.

3992597,1,B002UNMW7O,"What a complete disappointment. After 10 years of teasing fans of the original movie with promises of a sequel, THIS is what we get?? BDS2 was complete schlock.

Much of BDS2 is just re-enacted scenes from the first movie, forced-in where they don't really fit. The story is a series of contrivances that undermine the story of the first movie.

The MacManus brothers are no longer presented as shepherds set on a righteous path by God.  Instead they are now born killers who cannot control the hunger to kill again, which is backed by some vague desire for personal revenge.

The MacManus brothers are in conflict with each other, but not in the same good-natured way as in the first film. This never plays out to any kind of conclusion, making it one of many things that just don't make any sense in the movie.

Some new characters:

Romeo.  Apparently the movie needed a new Rocco.  Unfortunately, what we end up with is a Jar Jar Binks character that everyone would have been much happier without.

Eunice.  She wants to be a badass lawgirl.  Instead, she comes across as a stripper who likes playing pretend cops-and-robbers.

The Roman.  The new ""bad guy"". This character could have been *anyone* - it really wouldn't have made any difference to the story.

Returning characters:

Detectives Geenly, Duffy, and Dolly are superfluous to the story and are there almost solely to remind the audience that this movie is supposed to have something to do with the original BDS.

Agent Smecker is briefly onscreen.  Again, this is a contrivance - put Willem Dafoe on the credits, draw in that audience...

Billy Connolly is back as Il Duce.  Unfortunately he isn't given any good dialogue and doesn't play much part in the action either.  If he had been given something to do in this movie, there would have been little need for Romeo.

So it seems that BDS2's goal was just to get fans to open up their wallets and bend over.  But if you're a fan of the first movie, you're going to (try to) watch this one anyway.",1295049600,3,2014,4.629943502824859

There is a god-forsaken hockey monologue from Denis Leary, delivered by a character in full hockey gear in a dream sequence right after he gets shot and killed.

This film about two Irish brothers who are vigilantes with a bifurcated means of delivering justice (murder in the name of the Church) was written by brothers Troy and Taylor Duffy (Troy Duffy also directs) from Connecticut whose only credits include the same roles for the 1999 original BOONDOCK SAINTS and paling in their own band named after the movie. It has moments that entertain, but the film is primarily concerned with noise, slaughter, potty mouth dialogue, and confusing use of forward and backward black and white film clips that are supposed to serve clarifying the confusing plot.

The McaManus brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus), some years past their initial episode of crime in the name of the Church in Boston, are living a quiet life in Ireland with their father (Billy Connolly), but when they learn their beloved priest has been killed by mob forces, the duo return to Boston to bring justice to those responsible. They take on an assistant - Mexican fighter Clifton Collins, Jr. - and plan the destruction of the killers of the priest.  Naturally there are cops who were in one the original assassinations and they fear for their MacManus friends, but the FBI Special Agent Eunice (Julie Benz, sporting a maladaptive Southern drawl) enters and takes over and the rest is history - and blood, and murders, and caricatures of crime bosses, and noise, and CGI effects.  There are a number of actors with bit parts - Willem Dafoe, Judd Nelson, Peter Fonda - that add little to the big pie. One of the advantages of the DVD is the option to turn on subtitles: otherwise the dialogue is fairly indecipherable under the noise and the 'music score' by Jeff Danna.

If you go into your viewing of Boondock Saints 2 expecting a movie you'll be seeing at the Oscars, you may come out disappointed.  If you go into your viewing just looking to be entertained for two hours, you'll come out happy.

BDS2's biggest bane is that it features some really poor acting out of a few characters.  I love Julie Benz in Dexter, but her ""southern accent"" in this movie is just horrible, and her portrayal as a hardened female FBI agent is just corny.  Fortunately, both the accent and the ""she-woman hear me roar"" stuff kind of disappears as the movie goes on.

Like the first film, the brothers steal the show here.  Rocco is replaced by another similar character who provides some good comedic relief, but the brothers themselves are HILARIOUS, and at the same time total badasses and the most convincing actors of the bunch.

Like the first film, a semi-serious plot is kept light hearted via some over the top shootouts and a great mix of humor.  There is a ton of fan service in this movie if you liked the first one.  The finish is pretty good, though nowhere near the level of pure epicness of the courthouse scene from the first movie.

Simply put, it's not as good as the first one, but it's still a very fun two hours if you don't take it too seriously.",1277683200,,1368,4.453815261044177

As for the second, I just do not have the words. I tried to put myself in the director's shoes but, I have no idea what got into him. The movie is so bad. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting and even worse direction. I had hoped that even if it was bad, it could be that bad movie that I didn't mind liking. You know what I mean? No go. The only cool part of this movie is seeing Willem Dafoe in the ending sequence. I wish this title didn't have to die. It was set up for a continuation but, unless the rights are sold to a better film maker, another cannot happen.

This movie is everything a Saints fan could want. Not only is it a sequel. But it also tells the story of how it all began. It also has a couple of cameo appearance's I won't spoil for you. The final review is simple. If you liked the first Saints, there is no reason you shouldn't like this one. If you have never even seen the first Saints. Well I don't suppose you'll completely understand this movie in full. I believe it's $10 here on Amazon. If you haven't seen the first one do yourself a favor before you watch Boondock Saints II and get caught up on the story. Otherwise I'm quite sure you'll be lost.

Threfore, if you are bringing in new chracters that were related to chracters in the first movie, then do a flash-back of them in this follow-up movie.  I didn't know I was supposed to memorize their names for 10 years.

It was difficult to figure out what was going on in this poorly put together pieces & parts movie and I wasn't entertained at all.  The acting wasn't serious, it wasn't taken seriously either.  The actors did all but wink back at us viewers.  The acting was either extremely over-done or tongue-in-cheek.

I love the actress from Dexter but her role in this movie was too fake for me.  Her southern accent?!  Please!  And her investigating technique was a lame copy of the TV Monk character.

The whole movie was lame as far as explaining what was going on and why.  Glad I didn't buy the DVD but just borrow it.  I still want my 2 hours back or did it just feel like forever before the movie ended?

I am embarassed for Billy C, Fonda and the Dexter wife.  I hope the paycheck they showed-up (physically but not mentally)for was worth it.",1273190400,,1168,4.413145539906103

3992686,4,B002UNMW7O,"Hiding in Ireland with their father (the grey haired assassin from Boondock Saints) for the past 8 years, the MacManus brothers are being pulled back to Boston by someone who killed a priest using their trademarks (pennies on the eyes). Of course the returning crew of police detectives from Boondock I (who have since sainted the MacManus brothers for doing what they only dream of doing...rid society of scum) don't believe they are responsible and have the pretty, big belt wearing FBI Agent Eunice Bloom (from Buffy, Angel and Dexter) who agrees. They realize that someone wants the brothers to come out of hiding. The Yakavetta Family Mob Boss (played by Judd Nelson) only knows that he wants revenge for his father's death, and the death of the Saint's is the only answer. Meanwhile, we find out how and why the Elder MacManus became a killer (ironically it was the death of his father by mobsters). There is also his eventual capture and incarceration as a result of his brandishing his own sense of justice. As the person at the center of this charade is unveiled, you will marvel at the quick and easy pace of the movie.

Now while I loved part 1, there were times in part 2 that I thought they tried way too hard. The easy flow of humor from Boondock 1, at times seemed forced in 2. I also don't think that Bloom was half as good as Dafoe's Smecker. But all in all I was satisfied with the final product, and I am sure that we will see the Saints again, I just hope Duffy goes back to some of the magic he created in Part 1. For those who just want to pick up Part 2 without seeing Part 1, I wouldn't suggest it. As a stand alone, you probably won't get or appreciate it, OR understand Part 2. But as a sequel you'll appreciate it where the Saints have been and where they are going because this movie picks up right after the last one. Either way, have a ""Saint Marathon"" one weekend and gooble up a great story.",1272585600,7,1923,4.38655462184874

3992688,1,B002UNMW7O,"Guilty admission: I thought Boondock Saints was so badly directed, produced, written and shot that my mouth hung open in shock watching it but I enjoyed laughing at it. It was apparently made for 12-year-old boys by 10-year-old boys (dumb ones, no less). Why some folks think it is a ""classic"" is beyond me unless they mean it is a classic of rotten movie-making. In that case I wholeheartedly agreed. It is amateurish except for a few minutes of fair acting. I see no reason why this trashy sequel was made. However, at least they were consistent with the quality of the first. I can say that the first Boondock Saints was fun for me in a perverse way. I like bad movies. However, the sequel to a bad movie that is as pathetic as its original is pointless.: There is no surprise or delight left. It is just the same junk continued for no reason. Perhaps the director thought he was redeeming himself for the first movie. Maybe he believed he had actually improved or learned something or had new ideas? Nope. It is just like watching terrible movie twice. I don't get it. Then, again, I am not a 10-year-old boy who is impressed by blood, cursing or ""cool"" stuff like that. I think it was just made to squeeze another nickel from those poor souls who think the first ""movie"" was art.
Note: I was curious and looked up both these clunkers on [...] who puts the sequel in his ""Your Movie Sucks"" file...LOL...and [...] where only 20% of the hundreds of critics who reviewed these movies said they sorta of liked either movie. Most of these 20% critics are unknown or write for obscure sites. 80% of the other critics disliked the movies or downright hated them. Check it out.",1272499200,,1673,4.506578947368421

The action is ok, but the rest of the movie i really fell asleep to. So i watched it again and it was just as bad as me nodding off the first time! The plot is pretty weak, The acting is horrible including the seasoned actors, This movie isn't worth buying, its better to redbox it with a promo!

3992711,5,B002UNMW7O,"I was introduced to Boondock Saints 1 by a friend and was hooked instantly. All Saints Day was everything and more! Just seeing the brothers again was like coming home after 10 years and re establishing friendships that had been on hiatus. The action sequences were bigger and dare I say it, better than the first. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus continue to amuse with their antics and you can see the genuine affection and friendship come through in all their scenes together.

Billy Connolly reprises the role of Il Duce with the same flair he had in the first. Great to see that he has a bigger role this time around! Julie Benz was the perfect choice for the role of Special Agent Eunice Bloom. She comes across as super sexy but badass enough to keep you interested and she slots in nicely with the rest of the crew. Clifton Collins Jr is hysterical as Romeo. His facial expressions add to his charisma and you can't help but laugh at the brilliantly scripted and well executed lines he was fortunate enough to be given.

If you haven't seen Boondock Saints 1, I advise you to do so now. There are references to jokes that were present in the first movie that won't make any sense if you haven't seen it yet. The ending left me praying that there will be a third Boondock Saints movie.

All in all, I would have to say that this movie is just another example of the creative genius of Troy Duffy and a true credit to all the actors who star in this.",1272153600,,1462,4.387453874538745
3992712,3,B002UNMW7O,"I saw harsh reviews saying that its the new Transformers 2 = awful awful awful movie. But I agree with ""B Nice"" that Transformers 2 wasn't that bad. Take the movie for what it is: just an action packed summer blockbuster with comedy and a hot chick. What did you expect, a Best Picture out of Transformers 2? Of course not. Enjoy the special effects and stop criticizing the rest (sorry had to vent and defend Transformers 2, its decent, not terrible... like this one). But something like Boondock Saints 2 deserves more criticism than Transformers because the first is a cult classic and a new addition to the series may devalue the first. I agree with the average rating for this movie - 3 stars. I feel I had to voice my opinion because there's two extremes posted: awesome or awful. It is neither.

If I saw this one first then the original, I would have thought this was a good movie. However, seeing the epic first one and then this, I was a little let down... hence, your people's references to Transformers. However, like Transformers 2... it was decent in its own right and not as bad as many people are saying.

Now I will compare it to The Godfather series. For example, there are flash backs to the old days and it tries to be like The Godfather Part II in that way. I immediately thought of that when I watched it and even though I recognized it was trying to be like it, I still enjoyed those scenes... even though it was a little unoriginal.

The movie as a whole was not nearly as good as number one, but it doesn't make it a failure. The character Romeo was great. The concept was great... but the ""artsy"" scenes with the woman were a fail. Using sex appeal in those montages were insanely cheesy. That's the only thing. The woman FBI detective is just over the top with the accent (obvious it's not a real one) and she's trying too hard to be sexy. If she toned it down, this would have been a better movie. The accent is distracting and some of the scenes with her try too hard to be like Boondocks 1 scenes with Willem Dafoe. But it failed... If you're looking for something enjoyable and decent, this meets that requirement. Sex appeal, comedy, action. But the first had that (minus the sex) and was a great movie. This is where it falls short and probably because of the woman (not because she is one, but because she was over the top -- saying that to defer comments on sexism -- also I am straight... I'm just throwing that out there in advance so whoever comes out and says I am gay that the sex appeal devalued the movie... but it really does, it's over the top and cheesy in the montages).

It's enjoyable but doesn't meet the fans expectations of a great movie... hence my middle of the road review. Not awesome and not awful. The end action scene I expected more too... but still decent (just because not as good as first doesn't make something terrible) and the movie did get me excited for number 3. I do not want to give it away, but the value in this movie is the ending (and you'll know what I am talking about when you see it)... the end gets your hopes for the next installment to get back on track and to be as good as the first again... I just hope they tone down the woman character a bit and work on those ""faux-artsy 'how the crime went down'"" scenes.

Recycled jokes, overuse of the prayer finishing move, and two of the most cartoony characters ever seen in a movie (the Mexican fighter and the lady-detective). The movie even jokes itself (the ambush-planning scene).
The movie is just a joke. And one of the brothers is just so Botoxed out of his mind, just to add insult to injury.

3992717,2,B002UNMW7O,"It's a bit of a heartbreak to write a negative review for this movie because I wanted to like it so much, however, it fell completely flat for me.

It's going to sound like I've got a hate-on here, but, here are the negatives:

1.  Judd Nelson and Peter Fonda playing Italian Mafiosi.  The accents were -uh- not good... and not in the funny way that they were bad in the first film.

2.  Clifton Collins Jr.  Funny guy and very charismatic, but, the part that was written for him wasn't funny to me... it just seemed like one big Mexican joke.  I felt like Troy dropped the ball with this character.

3.  Julie Benz's character.  Gorgeous (love her in Dexter), but, every time she spoke with that southern accent, it completely threw me out of the film.  The character had a lot of potential, but, it felt like Troy was trying to make her an uber-sexy version of Smecker when I think that simply being his protege (with a character all her own) would have been enough.

4.  The Boys.  I love Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus and they certainly did no worse (or no better) of a job in II than in the original, however, it feels like this time they were reduced to buffoons.  I didn't feel any real anger from them this time around at all either.  Sure, the first was funny, but, there was an underlying current of discontent that fueled their murder spree.  I just didn't feel it this time.  I don't necessarily think this was the fault of the actors

Again, I wanted to love this film.  I read other reviews on this site and others and made my purchase.  I wasn't expecting the ""second coming"" here, but, I was hoping to have ended up watching, at least, a movie that I was proud to have in my collection and a decent sequel to a great film.

I read the reviews and talked to people that saw it and loved the first.. they hated it, said it did the first injustice, don't waste your time.. so I didnt... then I finally told myself that im going to just watch it and judge for myself. So I did and what I saw was an amazing film with an amazing story. does Eunice Bloom try to be Paul Smecker? to an extent yes.. they did try to have a quarky FBI agent to take his role, it can get a little cheezy sometimes with the way she says things and acts on the case, but understand she is Paul Smeckers hand picked replacement, so yeah she would need to be a little like him to be chosen by him.. understand? the boys have witty one liners throughout the movie that made me laugh my arse off the entire time. Romeo I think is a solid replacement for Rocco. I didn't like Rocco al lthat much in the first and I think Romeo does a solid job, as he is a tough La Razza kinda guy who doesnt take any crap, fits alot better than Rocco ever did (in my opinion). the bad guys in this film is where this film lacks the most, Yakavettas ""new crime syndacite is weak at best and lack all the things to make them a good enemy to the Saints, they seem like push overs and characters taht you really don't care if they live or die. its when Il Duce ( the borthers father) story folds out when the main antagonist is revealed when i started to think... hey, now I like this story, and was attentive to the screen to see how it all played out, and it played out just fine, great ending and a FANTASTIC cliffhanger, almost better than the ending to the first.  ( i say almost because the court room scene and the speech thereafter is still my favorite climax to any movie i have ever seen). so get Boondock Saints 2 if you liked the first, get the second, it will not dissapoint you.",1271376000,,2049,4.059259259259259
3992723,5,B002UNMW7O,I think Boondock Saints is one of those movies you will either love or hate. No inbetween. I loved them both. Non-stop action and the realistic relationship between the two brothers (getting into a fight in the middle of a job) make this a great movie.

It's still vastly entertaining, with most of the original cast in addition to ""the boys"" as they return to Boston to avenge the killing of a priest after a long time in hiding. The story progression was very similar to the original film, with enough new material to keep it from feeling like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. I was concerned about Rocko's ""replacement"" initially, I feared that his ethnicity would be ""overdone"", but it never occurred to me again, Clifton Collins Jr. put in a solid performance as the comic relief, being given a slew of fabulous lines.

This movie is essentially very similar to the first, and that's why I like it so much.  Duffy made a few tweaks here and there, brought in a Godfather II type of back story, and gave us, for the first time, a strong female character.  Julie Benz does a great job in the role - shows that attractiveness isn't all in the curves.
Connor and Murphy often take a backseat to other plot elements, giving more of the movie to establishing Eunice's character and the Duke's backstory.
Yet we already know them.  You would likely have to watch the first movie to really get into this one, but if you don't own the first movie already, why are you even reading the Amazon description of this one?",1271030400,,784,4.342465753424658

But reviews for it were not terrible and I generally think better of movies than most reviewers.  However, All Saints Day did not live up to my expectations.  It was still a good film.  But it didn't have the same feel as the original.  First, I could wrap my head around the fact that Sean Patrick Flanery was reprising his role because he looked almost nothing like himself from the first movie.  Second, there seemed to be too many attempts at comedy that diluted the action-packed feel of the first.  The original had just the right balance of funny/ironic and badass action.  Third, the plot was not as intriguing as the original although the twists are at the very least interesting.

Overall, I would not say it was worth the money but a good movie nonetheless.",1270857600,,941,4.514792899408284
3992746,2,B002UNMW7O,"SPOILER ALERT
I have seen part one over 20 times. I cannot say that I will be watching this movie more than I have to. There was so much they could have done. The movie was quite cheesy and predictable. It's like they took the script of part one and rewrote the scenes but in different settings. For example, the best scene in part one is when they fight in the air-duct pipe and fall down hanging from the ropes. Part two, they fight in a wooden crate, it falls down and breaks open.
Then they had the dumb corny characters like the guy sunbathing in speedos, just stupid.
They tried to force us to love the characters, e.g. Detective Greenly, he's just annoying, very unlikeable character, when he died the other characters cried to a dramatic effect to make us love the character. It didn't work.
This was obvious when watching the extras, Troy Duffy talks about how he's buddies with the actor that played Greenly, so basically, he adapted the script to please his buddies. It's like he wrote the script with one purpose, to get-together, have fun and reminice over the first movie instead of focusing on a script that takes the second movie to another level. I honestly cannot believe the same writer wrote both movies.
Don't bother buying the movie, rent it watch it once and see what you think.

3992747,3,B002UNMW7O,"Couldn't they afford to hire a better actress, especially one that would replace the amazing Willem Dafoe? At least they could have hired her a decent vocal coach so she didn't sound completely ridiculous with that phony southern accent. It totally wasn't believable that she was his protege--even he didn't seem to like her! There was no chemistry between them whatsoever; they should have just let Willem be in the whole movie.
I really liked the movie--it was funny, and the action was great (though Flanery looked like he used a little too much Botox). If they had cut Benz out, it would have been so much better--personally, I think she's a terrible actress, especially in Dexter (which was probably the only reason she got in this movie).
Her character was not endearing whatsoever; she was far too condescending and wasn't funny at all, not even remotely like Willem in the first movie. They should have gotten Charlize Therone, she would have been perfect, and the audience would have respected her.
Troy Duffy made a serious mistake hiring Benz to play the LEADING female role--he really made her look goofy in the crime scene replays (especially in the cowboy outfit), scenes that made the first movie so unique and made the second movie look ridiculous. I seriously hope she doesn't make it to the third movie.",1270684800,5,1321,4.849557522123894

The writing was absolutely horrible and the acting was atrocious.  Most of the movie should have been cut out. The acting was so bad with the lame jokes and one liners, ugh.

Yeah, it could have been better, but it also could have been a lot worse.

This movie isn't as 'gritty' as the first and I miss that aspect.  The script is also not nearly as creative with many of the same scenes of the first recreated in the second with a different twist.  I was hoping for some more 'off the wall' originality that I loved in the first film!

Many of the same characters are back for an encore performance but the script doesn't do them the justice like the first one did.  The new characters seem to lack the originality and flair of the original cast.  There are some really funny moments that do make the movie worth seeing.

Overall I felt that the movie was too short.  It would have been so much better if they had done less with more depth.  Though the movie was very exciting, and keeps you hooked, I had so much hope for the sequel following such a great original.  IF you haven't seen the first one, DO IT!

Am anfang war ich eher skeptisch ob man so einen genialen Film wie The Bonndock Saints berhaupt Fortsetzen kann,aber Troy Duffy hat es geschafft.

Ich verstehe die schlechten kritiken berhaupt nicht, in Deutschland obwohl der erste teil dort Verboten ist gibt es eine riesige Fan gemeinde, weil der erste und auch zweite Teil der Serie einfach Genial ist.

Fazit: Eine der besten Fortzsetzungen zu einem Film der eh schon totaler Kult ist!!!

I've seen the first one probably 100 times, own 2 DVD copies of it, 1 Blu Ray copy of it, and can pretty much recite every line of the movie given the opportunity.  I'm not saying that to say I have a bias but rather because Saints II manages to get a weird backlash from the first film's fans and I don't think it's warranted.

Saints II is definitely not like the first one.  But it's also not so far off from the first one that it shouldn't be sharing its name.  It came 10 years after the first film debuted and I believe that it does a great job of finding the ""sweet spot"" between what needs to be in a sequel and what can make it its own story.  It also does something you don't see in many sequels, especially ones appearing a decade later: it welcomes back the main cast.

It has also caught flack for being ""racist"", ""anti-gay"", and a whole host of misnomers.  This is the way the east coast is.  I don't think it even crossed anyone from the coast's mind.

All in all, this is a great followup to the first one.  It has humor, action, and fun, referring back to the ""magic formula"" that made the first one a cult classic.",1269907200,,1161,4.138392857142857

However, their life in exile is rudely interrupted when they receive word that a priest in Boston has been murdered using their signature 'two in the back of the head and pennies over the eyes' method. Disgusted by this slur on their 'mission', the brothers head back to Boston armed to the teeth and with vengeance on their minds - but unbeknownst to the brothers, forcing their return is just the first step in an audacious plan initiated by an old enemy...

If you enjoyed Troy Duffy's original ""Boondock Saints"", then I fail to see why you wouldn't enjoy this sequel, as it really is more of the same albeit with a slightly expanded canvas. Like the first film, it is consistently enjoyable, even if it doesn't entirely work all of the time. Why some fans have taken such umbrage at it, I've no idea; I can only assume that the original has become so much of a cult film in the ten years since it's release that it has been blown out of all proportion in some people's minds.

Myself personally, I enjoyed every Garth-Ennis-styled minute of the sequel. Sure, like the original, its nowhere near being the most perfect movie ever made, but I was entertained throughout because, lets face it, its vastly more entertaining than most of the mainstream action fare being made by big budget studios. That and it had an ending that left me genuinely desirous of a third film.

3992782,4,B002UNMW7O,"In 2000, ""The Boondock Saints"" which was written and directed by Troy Duffy received a limited release in only five theaters in one week.  Critically panned, one would think the film would fade to obscurity.  But this was not the case.  Similar to Kevin Smith's ""Clerks"", ""The Boondock Saints"" amassed a huge underground following and had become a cult film grossing $50 million in domestic video sales.

The first film revolved around three Catholic Irish anti-heroes - Poppa (played by Bill Connolly) and his two fraternal twin sons Connor (played by Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (played by Norman Reedus) MacManus who are vigilantes that take on the Russian mafia with their way and their style of vigilante payback.

A decade later, with the popularity of the first film, ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is backed by Sony Pictures and given a nationwide theatrical release in 67 theaters and due to fan demand, more cities were added to the release.  Once again, the critics were not so supportive of the film but yet the fans have once again come to support the film and the film made over $10 million in the box office but now Blu-ray and DVD release will be unleashed to the masses and I have no doubt that once again, ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is going to do well.

In ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"", eight years have passed and after the three men murdered Giuseppe ""Papa Joe"" Yakavetta (and countless members of the mafia).

When a priest was murdered, someone tries to frame the Saints and now the police (especially the Saint's friends on the inside) are worried that the Saints who have been quiet are back to cause more mayhem.  The public is still divided on their feelings towards the Saints.

Meanwhile, the Saints are called in for their help and to avenge the death of the priest.  As the two travel back to the U.S. by boat, a man named Romeo (played by Clifton Collins Jr.) who has idolized the Saints wants to be part of their crew and needless to say, he has to earn his place amongst the group.

As for the police, Greenly (played by Bob Marley), Duffy (played by Brian Mahoney) and Dolly (David Ferry) worry that their friends may be back and with the FBI sending one of their top investigators named Eunice (played by Julie Benz) to assist them, they worry that the FBI may find out that the three detectives assisted the Saints back then.  Eunice is not only intelligent and sexy (easily catching the attention of the three detectives) but she can easily come up in her mind of what happens at a crime scene plus she's also known to be very good with her gun as well.

While the Saints look for who killed the priest, the FBI and police looking for the Saints, the media hype has attracted the attention of Conzezio Yakavetta (played by Judd Nelson) who wants revenge for the Saints murdering his father on public television.  So, once again, the Yakavetta family are planning to get their revenge against the Saints.

Who will end up victorious?

VIDEO:

""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Cinematography by Miroslaw Baszak did a pretty solid job with the overall shots.  The action sequences are well-done, enjoyed the lighting of several of the sequences.  Those well-lighted scenes are vibrant while certain scenes are cold and bluish.  I didn't notice any artifacts, nor did I notice any DNR.  The picture quality has a fine layer of grian, blacks are nice and deep and overall, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment did a solid job in terms of picture quality for the Blu-ray release.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is literally an adrenaline pumping, action-packed, kick ass film which I found much better than the first and literally had a lot of fun watching it.

What I find interesting is that ""The Boondock Saints"" was a film that didn't even have a chance for a theatrical release but found a humongous cult following on video.  And here we are with the sequel, the critics obviously share a different opinion towards this film but among the viewers, they loved the film.  As for me, I really enjoyed the film and felt this Blu-ray release is awesome!

I enjoyed the addition of the new characters, enjoyed the action sequences, the weapons and enjoyed the story of this sequel. It's a much different tone compared to the first film but the film definitely benefits from a slightly higher budget. And the surprise ending... I never saw that coming.  So, I'm really excited for the possibility of a third ""Boondock Saints"" film.

It's important to point out to those not familiar with the film is that ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"", the film is more action.  Yes, there is a storyline but for those expecting something deep are probably not going to find it in this sequel.  The performances of the talent may seem off at times and I'm sure many will have issues with the Irish and the Southern accents used by the talents.

If anything, I expected nothing but an action-packed film featuring a lot of gun fighting, plenty of action and profanity but I really enjoyed the addition of Clifton Collins Jr. as Romeo and Julie Benz as Eunice.  Collins brings the comedy portion with his character and Julie Benz brings the sexiness.  And both characters definitely kick ass!

The Blu-ray release is absolutely fantastic although I can see some fans who have not upgraded to Blu-ray being a bit upset that the Comic-Con featurette (and two other featurettes) are only Blu-ray exclusives but as this is a Sony Pictures  film and there is a move by the industry towards Blu-ray and Blu-ray exclusives not featured on a normal DVD release are to be expected.

Overall, ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" was an enjoyable action-based film. A lot of guns,  a lot of violence, a lot of profanity and just overall, a fun film.  There are also a good number of surprises, especially deaths of major characters in this film which was quite surprising.

If you enjoyed the first ""Boondock Saints"", you'll definitely enjoy the sequel.  Definitely recommended!",1269302400,20,8820,4.809966777408638
3992783,3,B002UNMW7O,"When I first heard they were making a sequel to this classic, I said, ""oh hell no. How are they going to butcher it?""  And when it was finally released in theaters, a chorus of mixed reviews rang out.

But to be honest, I didn't hate it.

The Saints are back, (Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery), lured out of their hiding place in Ireland by a copycat killer.  Julie Benz (from the Showtime hit ""Dexter"") is the new Agent Smecker, if you will, and I found her quite expendable.  Her character was helpful to the boys in the same way that Smecker was but not to the same passionate level.  If she wasn't in the movie, it wouldn't have been such a horrible thing.  No offense to Ms. Benz, since I think she did a great job with the role she was given, but the role could have been left on the cutting room floor and we would have been none the wiser, especially since we had the trio of detectives from the last film, (yes, including Greenley), to help the Saints get their revenge under the legal radar.

Romeo (Clifton Collins, Jr.) is the newest addition to the entourage and he is enjoyable, although at times he tries to be laugh-out-loud funny and I just wasn't feeling it.  But he brought a new spin to the Rocco-type vibe we had in the first film.  David Della Rocco even makes a few cameo appearances as the spirit of Rocco, letting the boys know that he is still with them in spirit.

Billy Connolly returns as well for the sequel and this film delves into a deeper back story on him, explaining why he was in jail in the first place and how he is connected to everything.  This film feels more like a prequel of questions answered that we might not have needed answered in the first place.  Some things are better left un-overexplained.

All in all, the humor is still there and there are a few action-packed scenes that support the kick-assness of the first film.  But it was definitely a bit lackluster.  Judd Nelson as the new villain, (i.e. Yakavetta's son), was kind of a snooze fest, at times almost even painful to watch.  And there are a few surprises in this one that die-hard fans might have a problem with.

If you were a fan of the first film, you should definitely check out this film, at least for the fact that director Troy Duffy didn't get overly cocky with the sequel, as some were expecting--he kept the material mainly to what the fans were saying they wanted.  Although as I watched, I tried so hard to not consider this movie a sequel and instead a stand-alone film, (after all, it's been over ten years since the first film), but if this film were to stand on its own, it would wobble.",1269302400,3,2623,4.360082304526749

3992785,1,B002UNMW7O,"In honor of St. Patrick's Day yesterday, I decided to finally view this movie to find out if it had much in common with its successful cult classic predecessor. This movie made me almost forget everything I enjoyed about the original. If you are an incredibly devoted Boondock Saints fan, you'll probably love this movie because of all the throwback themes of the brothers screwing up on the way to their missions and the willingness of bad guys to stay kneeling in one spot while they are prayed at before being executed.

For the more casual observer, this is one of the most ridiculous over-the-top B movies I've seen in a long time. So much that I had to look up and confirm that yes, this movie was also written and directed by Troy Duffy, the same man who did the first one.  Only 8 years have passed in movie time, but 10 years have passed in real life. Connor and Murphy are still played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, but they look much older now! The stuff they got away with looking like kids just doesn't play as well now that they are in their 40s! There's just no hiding how weathered they look. When you're making big mistakes at their age, they just look incompetent and it isn't as much fun when it feels so sad.

Unique and honest moments in the first film that became quotable and memorable as a result did not happen here. So much felt forced, profanity for profanity's sake led to a trio of cops sounding more like the Three Stooges than law enforcement. They added a Mexican to their team complete with lots of stereotyping and his eyes bug out of his head so badly, I guess he must be the comic relief. But to what? The whole thing feels like a comedy, the drama almost never gets over.

Let's start with the beginning. The brothers are shepherding on a sheep farm in Ireland with their father and have grown almost Moses-like hair in matching brown.  Wow. After a copycat kills a priest in the same style the Saints did, they feel the need to go to America to confront them. This results in a lot of dead people.

Willem DaFoe's successor is FBI Special Agent Eunice Bloom played by Julie Benz whom you might remember as Darla from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel TV Series. A lot has changed in her appearance but she shows up with a saucy Southern accent to prove how dumb (as if we needed the help, they can barely form sentences) the Three Stooges of law enforcement are by explaining the crime scenes as DaFoe once did. She lacks his charm and charisma and comes off as you-can't-touch-me diva with an attitude so hard-as-nails that you never really warm to her character. Her accent does not make her seem more intelligent, just saucy. But I'm sure guys will warm to something else about her like the long legs and insane heels made for street walking.

The movie gets a little better when their father joins in played by Billy Connolly shows up to be dramatic with an old foe. The flashbacks of his youth don't add very much to the story and when you find out the big reason behind all this blood and violence, you'll probably feel pretty annoyed as I was.

The action feels similar, that whole disorganized randomness that results in precision headshots and criminals willing to hold still and wait for their death.

Overall, this movie feels very disappointing and takes away from the greatness of the original by association. I really need to go rent the first one again to remind myself what I liked because this felt so wrong.",1269129600,15,3481,4.486571879936809
3992786,2,B002UNMW7O,"Just watched the movie; was a big fan of Saints I. It pains me to say that while it's watchable, it's ultimately cartoonish and overdone. The brothers' relationship is taken for granted, and they are moved through obligatory gunplay like pieces on a board. The humor between them and their Mexican sidekick is phony and overdone, and his character is never clear. And Peter Fonda's accent sucks. He obviously didn't take much time preparing for his role, as limited as it was. Don't get me wrong -- the movie wasn't terrible, but it could -- and should -- have been so much better. I watch the original every so often. I don't think I'll watch this one again.",1269043200,2,659,4.593220338983051

3992788,1,B002UNMW7O,"Now I'm a fan of the first film and was very excited, like many others, to hear of a sequel in the making. Funny thing is almost every sequel ever made is complete crap and this movie is no different. I need to stop getting excited when I hear of a sequel coming because they are nothing more than let downs.

Anyway, on to the movie. After watching only 3 minutes of this movie I was shaking my head in shame and throughout the entire movie thinking about leaving, though I decided to stay just in case it got better, it didn't. The movie opens with the brothers in Ireland as shepherds with guns for herding sheep of course, lighting cigarettes in unison with manly unkempt beards on horseback. It seemed like the director was trying to go for an 'epic' scene here, where he introduces the brothers and was hoping the audiences reaction would be excitement upon seeing the brothers and their long awaited return to the screen. This completely backfired and as the scene continued on it only got worse and worse. By the time the movie title appeared on screen, I knew I was in store for cheesy script writing, poor acting, and a terrible story.

The movie continues on and the brothers, all within 5 minutes, are already on their way back to the U.S., fully armed, hair and face cleaned up, and ready to kick some ass and take names. They are on what appears to be a cargo ship and as you all know, every cargo ship has late night fights in the cargo bay and grim looking men baiting the fighters on, taking bets, etc. On the ship the brothers encounter this 'crazy fast' fighting Mexican that is 'so fast', you wouldn't believe how fast he was...and how cheesy the whole idea was. They tried to make the Mexican seem like a complete bad ass in this scene, yet they never actualize this concept, in fact for the rest of the movie hes quite the opposite. The director just threw him on the back burner to be a stand in Rocko, clumsy, moronic, knows nothing, more annoying, following the brothers around, just fail.

I don't think I want to continue this review, it's really not worth the time to review it, I'm just going to stop. Overall the movie is riddled with lousy jokes, a woman with a very annoying western accent that tries to fill the shoes of Willem Dafoe but utterly fails, shoddy acting especially with the police actors and the 'crazy fast' Mexican, horrible storyline, and cheesyness explodes out in EVERY scene. I think the biggest problem with this film is that the director and writers were trying too hard to mirror image the original film, not focusing much on the movie having its own identity. I feel like the movie was just a terrible remake of the first, the actors/actress not having their own roles but rather filling the roles of their  predecessors in the first film, everything is a testimony to it being a shadow of a great film, but collapses under its own short comings. In the end the movie suffered and just comes off as a crappy sideshow that never should have been.",1268870400,4,3001,4.480804387568556
3992789,4,B002UNMW7O,"I am a total fan of the original. To me it was sheer genious. With that I will say All Saints Day...

3992802,3,B002UNMW7O,"Boondock Saints was my All Time favorite movie for about 5 years.  It is STILL in my Top Five Movies of ALL TIME.  I loved everything about Boondock I and was expecting atleast SOMETHING close with Boondock II.

I got a mockery.

There was less action, less dark humor, less plot, less acting, and far less directing.  I don't know if they were pressed for time, or pressed for money, or just bad direction... but it was bad.

In the first 15 minutes, I'm trying to decide if the 3 goon cops (from Boondock I, but who cared about them?) are the main characters, or if the Brothers are.  Because from what I remember from Boondock I, the Brothers were guys who got sick and tired of the Irish and Italian mobs and they took matters into their own hands.  In Boondock I, the movie was dark and mysterious and downright SEXY (with small bouts of darkly funny humor like the exploding cat scene).  In the 1st, the Brothers had an agenda: To right wrongs.  In 2nd, the Brothers were only trying to clear their name.  But they were acting as if they had been hired assassins for YEARS, when in actuality, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing in BDS 1.

This one, we've got the lighting that resemebles the 90s cult movie Clerks.  We've got scenes that are a mockery of Kill Bill moments.  We've got a terrible soundtrack with cheesy background songs.  (They're picking out guns and a crappy love song comes on?  I know you are supposed to treat your guns like ""ladies"" but c'mon.  This movie needed PUMP)  We've got a lady overacting (that Southern accent was laid on way too thick).  We've even got some guy shitting his pants. (is that really necessary?) We've got way too many one-liners, a ""funny guy"" who ain't funny (the cop guys, I liked Romeo), way too many words (way over-scripted), and just too much ""trying to be cool"" instead of just ""being cool.""

As far as the actual killer in the beginning who is mimicing the Brothers, I noticed in the first five minutes that he was wearing lifts in his shoes to make him taller.  Then, the cop pointed out the he was wearing lifts when she redesigned the crime scene.  Then, the director showed a shot of the shoes which had a picture with lifts.  Then, the killer had to put on one shoe and they made a big production out of showing us that he was about 2 inches taller when wearing the shoes.  I'm smart.  I don't need you to point out every single thing.  In the end, it didn't even matter that he wanted to be taller.  LAME.

The female cop was obviously a fill-in for the gay cop from the first movie.  There was no change there, except the female in this one was played up way too much to be some kind of sex symbol.  They even had slow motion scenes.  If she was a real detective, she would not be wearing 4"" heels.  I'm a chick who loves her heels, and I still think it was dumb to play up her part so much.

The Brothers were the best.  Norman Reedus has still got it.  They've aged a bit in the last 10 years since BDS, but they were fantastic.  Apart from the obviously scripted bickering in the warehouse, their relationship is still fantastic and it was believable.  I wish the director really focused on them.  And I wish he hadn't made light of their whole agenda to begin with.  It's like they FORGOT that BDS were badass ""normal"" guys who just got tired of the crap that was going on around them.

There were inconsistencies.  In BDS, they only performed the cross-aimed back of the head gunshot through the eyes to the mob bosses.  In BDS 2, they performed it to almost anyone.

You ever see ""Can't Hardly Wait""?  Well, ""Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is Seth Green's character.

They're indicating a 3rd BDS.  I hope to god they do it.

But this time, choose a director who's going to let the Brothers be as awesome as they are.  no spoofing, no copying past plots, no gimmicky one-liners and over-scripted parts.  Just let the Brothers run the show.  Because after all, it is THEIR show.",1268870400,,3964,4.377747252747253

A sidekick made sense and Clifton Collins Jr. was pretty awesome as Romeo. The action is top notch and Sean and Norman were fantastic in this one as well.

The sequel took along time to come to fruition and it is well worth it. Anybody who says the Boondock Saints II is too late is not a real Boondock fan. I would have waited impatiently another ten years if I had too. Just be grateful we got another movie. Hopefully there will be a Boondock Saints III sometime in the near future. This movie is superb.

3992809,3,B002UNMW7O,"Expectations were high. After 10 years, the much-anticipated sequel to the cult-hit classic Boondock Saints finally crawled out of development hell, made it to the big screen and now, onto Blu-ray. The buzz around the sequel, however, seemed largely fan-generated, and hopes were high that this sequel, likely too late, would live up to the original.

Personally, I was skeptical. It's incredibly difficult to imagine a follow-up that could do the original justice, and since this movie had been in the works for so long (heck, there was some speculation that it was going to come out in 2005) that I was afraid that it would, frankly, not be very good. My hopes were sparked, however, when it was confirmed that much of the talent from the original was returning: Troy Duffy, Norman Reedus, amd Sean Patrick Flanery. Perhaps some of the magic would be rekindled with all of these names back in the game.

The result was mixed. Some fans thought it was the perfect follow-up, others thought it was horrid. I admit that I fell somewhere in the middle. I enjoyed it as a decent action movie with some fun one-liners, thought it was a fairly acceptable sequel, but, deep down, I think that the franchise would have been perfectly fine without this movie.

In All Saints' Day, fraternal twins Conner (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) , known as ""The Saints,"" are living a quiet life in Ireland with their father after leaving Boston prior to their stint as mobster-killing vigilantes. They soon realize that the quiet country life isn't for them and that it's time to clear their names, so they head back to Boston to continue fighting the mob. Around the same time as their arrival, a priest is killed in a manner similar to that of The Saints (this becomes a revenge motive for the MacManus brothers). FBI Agent Eunice Bloom (Julie Benz) steps in to investigate, working with local detectives (and familiar faces) Duffy (Brian Mahoney), Dolly (David Ferry) and Greenly (Bob Marley). She quickly concludes that the crime was committed by a copy-cat, but as the crimes become more frequent, it becomes obvious that the real Saints are back in town.

By far, Julie Benz steals the show in every scene she appears in. Though it quickly becomes apparent that she is, essentially, William Defoe's character Paul Smecker from the first movie, Benz plays a fun, believable character with a sweet southern accent who is ""so f*ing smart"" that she ""makes smart people feel retarded."" By the time I was halfway through the movie, I just couldn't get enough of her. The returning characters seemed to easily fall back into their roles, particularly Reedus and Flanery. But sadly, it just wasn't the same without William Defoe, who, in my opinion, was one of the best parts of the first movie. Even though he does make a cameo at the very end (and it implies that he will return in a supposed third movie), it just wasn't the same.

The screen writing was as fun as I remember the first movie being, complete with one-liners and curse-laden dialog. Sadly though, the first half of the movie or so just felt like a recycled version of the first, with a plot that I had definitely seen before and that frequently threatened to be stale and/or boring. It did pick up in the second half though, with more action, more surprises and a somewhat unexpected ending that, while enjoyable, felt sadly disjointed from the earlier parts of the movie, almost like the there was a big gap between when the first and second halves of the movie were written.

While I didn't have the opportunity to see the movie in theaters (it seemed to come and go pretty quickly), I got to enjoy it in full-blown Blu-ray glory. While the film itself felt a little low budget and old (as in, it felt a little bit like it was released in the 90s), the picture and sound quality were top-rate, particularly in the action sequences, where it felt like bullets were flying at me through the screen.

The Blu-ray edition of Boondock Saints II is presented in lovely 1080p and 2.35:1 high definition. The Blu-ray includes French, Portuguese, and Spanish audio, as well a English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles.

The special features are pretty generous, particularly on the Blu-ray version. They include a collection of very short deleted scenes, a 25 minutes behind-the-scenes feature discussing the franchise's popularity, a funny sit down with Connelly and Duffy, and (exclusive to Blu-ray) a special behind-the-scenes and interview feature, a ten minute piece on the weapons used in both films (ideal if you're into the guns), and a 60 minute feature on Comic Con.

Overall, All Saints Day can be approached as a fun action flick, but may rub some hardcore fans the wrong way. While I personally feel like the movie was a bit of a disappointment, I'm glad I at least watched it.",1268611200,2,4867,4.78452380952381

3992831,2,B002UNMW7O,"No spoilers in this review.  I was so excited to see this movie.  The first movie is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time, I have it on Blue Ray & DVD.

The begenning of the movie is horrible, only about halfway it starts to get better.  The wife and I counted numerous plot holes, we kept saying (why did the characters do, or are doing that?).  The thing about the first movie is that it didn't mean to be funny, but it was.  This movie TRIES to be funny, and it just does not work.  My two favorite characters from the first movie are not in this movie, William Dafoes character and Rocco.  This would have been OK, but they try to replace them.  William Dafoe's character is a woman FBI agent with a horrible southern accent & tereible acting (she's hot though).  Rocco's replacement character is this rather unfunny ""mexican"" actor.  It just does not work.  They try to use the same formula with regards to action as the first movie and it just feels tacked on.  (Show the crime about to happen, show the result with all the dead bodies, have the detectives talk through the crime as it's happening in slow mo).

On the plus side, they do bring back other minor characters.  The 3 detectives, the bartender with terets (love him) and the guy who has the weapons cache.

Absolute worst part of the movie.  In thier first return hit the brothers talk about what plan of action to take.  The plan plays in slow mo with the brothers hair all slicked back, corny action and 70's style porn music.  I almost shed a tear after that part.

Final Verdict.
- 1 star for William Dafoe's character SNAFU
- 1 star for Rocco's character SNAFU
- 1 stay for unfunny, rushed, just plain bad script, plot holes, etc.

This was the biggest piece of rat turd I have ever seen. EVERYTHING was wrong with this film  here's a breif list to start
The acting was terrible
Sean Patrick Flannery has you guessing if its really him do to some TERRIBLE plastic surgery (no joke I checked the back of the DVD 3 times to make sure and am still sketchy about it)
The script - embarrassing
The music - Horrible
Plot- there was one?
 This movie sucked 5 minutes in and continued straight to the end .
Seriously I can't believe this movie is allowed to exist. I also can't believe that it was the same director and actors as the first.

3992835,4,B002UNMW7O,"I had my misgivings ever since I heard Troy Duffy was planning a sequel to his 1999 sleeper hit The Boondock Saints, but I was wrong...

 This is a movie for all those Boondock Saints fans out there and it does not disappoint!

We follow the MacManus Brothers ten years later hiding in Ireland, when they are drawn back into the game when they are supposedly connected to a hit on a priest back in Boston. So the Brothers return to Boston to exact revenge on who is framing them with the help of Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr--- who provides most of the comedy). And Stepping in the shoes of FBI Agent Smecker (Willem Defoe) is his protege Eunice Bloom whom she learned everything from her mentor (played by Julie Benz who is sexy, and smart in fact very smart, that she makes smart people feel like retards) And have to mention she looks very good in one sequence in a sort of cowboy outfit, complete with cowboy hat and all... very provocative. Expect some returning characters from the original... the 3 cops, the gun runner/seller, the bar keeper with turrets, their fatheer Il Duce (Billy Connolly) and a fan favorite.. Rocko ""I killed your cat you druggie b***!"" Still my favorite line from The Boondock Saints

Anyways...

This was a fun movie, nice gun play, comedy, kick ass soundtrack, Troy Duffy does not disappoint the fans, he has delivered in Spades, and the ending is very cool, a special cameo by someone that you would not expect! And the ending hints toward, of course wait for it... Boondock Saints III Pray to the Rosary (that's what I would title it haha)

One can tell Duffy had a slightly bigger budget than he did with the original, cool visuals, good shootouts, the interaction between Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery didn't lose a beat after a 10 year hiatus, showing camaraderie as the brothers Macmanus with the joking, cussing and in fighting one can expect from brotherly love, its shows through their performances as our favorite pair of anti heroes.

3992836,2,B002UNMW7O,"'Boondock Saints' was a massive sleeper in 2001. It was campy, raw, gritty, over-the-top, violent, funny and action-packed. Great script, great chemistry, great directing, some very memorable one-liners and a kick-ass finale! The movie never took itself seriously. Easily worth multiple watches. A cult film and an underground favorite for all the right reasons.

What I was hoping for was more of what I typed up top. What I, and fans of the original got instead, is a mish-mash of poor acting, watered-down chemistry, a bad script, an uneven pace of the film and a general lack of direction. It was as if all the returning actors thought they could just sleepwalk their way through this movie and the new additions thought they could try and fit in as replacements for two outstanding characters from the original. It was all disjointed and any momentum the movie seemed to pick up was killed by Detectives Greenly, Duffy and Dolly and their poor attempts at trying to be funny cops. The ending with Billy Connolly and Peter Fonda is exceptional but not enough to save a film from taking itself too serious.

If there is to be a third film, and the ending leaves the door open for that possibility, I hope all involved watch both movies and find out where they went wrong with this sequel.

Writer/director Troy Duffy manages to reassemble practically the entire cast of the cult classic first film, and while the results may not hold up to how great the original film is, this sequel is still a wonderful experience.  The film begins with a murder of a Boston priest, which draws the McManus brothers Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) out of seclusion in Ireland, along with their father Il Duce (Billy Connolly), on a revenge mission against the mob, which leads to even bigger developments with just who is pulling the strings.  In between all this is a new partner for the brothers in Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr.) and sultry FBI agent Eunice (Julie Benz), along with some genuine surprises and enough nods to the original film to make even casual fans stand up and smile.

It is one of the best action/shoot-em-ups ever made but in a light hearted/non dark kind of way.

Go buy or downlaod it today.

Now, to Boondock Saints 2 : All Saints Day

Just About the entire original cast returns, including all of the main characters (albeit a couple in much much smaller roles)and most of the secondary characters.

My 1st thought was ...WOW! these guys look ancient now.

Duffy should have done the sequel 5 years ago.

It was a very good follow-up, as it didn't straw too far from the elements that made BS1 a great movie.

The film looked good for BluRay and had a good soundtrack and sound effects.

The acting was pretty good and the new characters carried their own weight, but the story did not seem as fresh and original as the 1st.

It could have been horrible, but it was definitely worth the price of admission, with the realese date Low Price Guarantee from Amazon.

I believe they left the door open for a 3 installment, but let's hope it's made in the next 2 years.

Now go watch BS2 on BluRay!",1268265600,,1088,4.4393939393939394

The Boondock Saints is a man's movie. There's no doubt about it. One of the things that made me anxious about ASD was the fact that there was a woman, Eunice, a Special Agent on the brothers' case. Julie Benz, however, did not disappoint.
Troy Duffy knows his stuff, and he knew what the fans wanted. The music performed by the Boondock Saints (Troy Duffy's band)was the cherry on top. This movie was everything I could have hoped for.",1268265600,2,769,4.579710144927536

It did not get a wide release as it appears this was more about getting it into the hands of all those that enjoy this franchise instead. The story contains plenty of guns, slow-mo action, graceful footage of a beautiful Fed, and redemption. The BD preserves the picture and DTS sound perfectly. The clarity is solid throughout and the channels are given plenty of usage from beginning to end. The supplements are outstanding and include:

* Deleted scenes. Very short and only last a couple minutes. Would have been nice to see Benz' emotions in the film for the character that gets killed but oh well.
* Behind the scenes, 25:40 minutes. A fan piece all the way that covers everything that one might ask about in making this franchise continue. Always plenty of F bombs to keep the entertainment up.
* Connelly/Duffy sit down, 9:15 minutes. Funny and relevant regarding these two; how they met, the creation process and plenty of humorous moments.

Exclusive to BD:

* Secrets from the set, 7:10 minutes. More behind the scenes interviews and fun clips.
* Weapons, 8:22 minutes. Completely worth every second if you are into the guns. Covers both films.
* Comic Con, 60 minutes. Footage from the convention last year. Covers signings, the sit down and some fun snippets before they arrive. (Nice Ron Jeremy visit).

I do not feel one should be disappointed in the overall product in any way, and I think the critics of this picked apart stuff just to do it. Yes, there are plenty of things to say were done incorrectly, but when that final plot twist hits, it makes me look forward to the next film that much more. 5 stars for everything.",1267833600,3,1809,4.605590062111801

-There are no likable characters unless your are easily swayed by two dimensional stereotypes like the smart beauty or the comedy relief minority.
-Relies solely on the reputation of the first ilm which wasn't that great to begin with.
-The humor isn't even funny at the elementary school level.
-The violence isn't exciting or well choreographed, it consists entirely for slow motion shots of the main characters holding pistols in front of them and repeatedly squeezing the triggers followed by a shot of 2 to 6 men dancing back and forth with pained looks as they slowly fall to the ground while their squibs go off.
So with all of these terrible facts, why give this movie two stars?
-I give credit to the actors for trying to perform around such terrible material. They cry convincingly when boring or downright stupid characters die before them, the female lead is consistant and works well with the chemistry of her costars, etc.
-I give the director credit for some interesting shots despite the fact that they go nowhere and provide nothing to the story.
If these final ""good"" points are enough to carry a film for you, then you are likely to enjoy it OR if you delight in a movie about characters who obsess over a faith in which they show absolutely no respect or even understanding of, you'll enjoy this film.

And then down the road have you ever been with the same friends goofing off again, and one guy remembers how funny and awesome that first thing was and tries WAAAY too hard to do something just as spontaneous and over the top so he will have a new story to tell?  But because he was trying it wasn't spontaneous, and because it wasn't spontaneous it wasn't ""funny over the top"" it was just plain ""way too much over the top"" and everybody looked at him like he was just dense or something?  Thats Saints part 2.

The first one was a true example of real movie magic, where everything just worked.  It showed real art from the actors, director, and producer.  The second one tried way to hard to be just like the first one.  So much so that alot of the first part of the movie actually felt like a parody of the first one.  The second half of the movie (after they got past making ""lets make fun of Saints 1"" jokes) was actually pretty good.  It got a bit more serious and actually told some interesting story points.

In all fairness I will say it really felt like the director felt the immense pressure to live up to the first one.  And in trying to stay close to the winning formula of the first ended up forcing things to fix the pattern.  I don't mean to trash talk this movie, but I will say that the first half of the movie was nearly painful to watch, and the second half I enjoyed.

It was much longer, so there was room for a truly great story to develop. And the timing on all the humor was nearly perfect. One thing that I was really relieved about was that Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr) did NOT turn out to simply be a Rocco replacement.

They overused similar film techniques used in the first one and replaced william dafoe with some woman who was not even near the caliber of actor.

However, it also had some bad dialogue, some atrocious acting, some crazy plot holes, over the top camerawork that added nothing to the story at many points in time, and very little subtlety.
Boondock 2 has none of the good of the first, and all of the bad. We are introduced to uninteresting characters, poorly written and poorly acted who take up majority of the story, the original Saints are hardly in the film at all. Willem Defoe and Billy Connoly are are wasted is their poorly written, unsubtle scenes. The music shrieks of late 90s. The action sequences are so confusing that they become boring. Shots are literally repeated, one after the other, for no reason except to watch the violence again. There is nothing redeeming about this film at all cinematically.

So is it as good as the first one? Yes. I will elaborate on the things that stood out for me. First, it is lower budget than the original. This is noticable immediately by the way the cinematography looks like a made for T.V. film. It's good cinematography mind you, beautiful shots, amazing direction, but you can just tell it's a cheap camera or something by the way it looks when the camera moves. It doesn't look like you're seeing a change of scenery, it looks like a camera pan on the set of a TV soap opera. This isn't as apparent as the action picks up, but right away you can tell it's low budget, and that's saying a lot compared to the first one. Other than that, everything lives up to the original, or surpasses it. It looks like all of the actors are having a lot of fun making the film, as you get a genuine sense that they are enjoying themselves every second of the movie. It's funny, it's action packed, and it's a great continuation of the original. If you didn't get a chance to see it in theaters definitely get this as soon as it comes out.
