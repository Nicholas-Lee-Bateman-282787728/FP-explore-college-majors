8113476,3,B000EQHX7S,I purchased the wrong dvd. my fault so it is okay.,1435881600,,50,3.6363636363636362
8113477,4,B000EQHX7S,"The audio/video on this VCI release is pretty good.  If you listen to the commentary on Unwed Mother you won't learn much of anything about the film.  He spends 90% of the time talking about other projects he was involved with.  Too Soon To Love doesn't have an end title, but it may have been made that way.  Another reviewer already mentioned the fake widescreen.  Otherwise, I found the films entertaining.",1381104000,,409,4.704225352112676
8113478,1,B000EQHX7S,"""Too Soon to Love"" has been artificially stretched from a full frame print then matted to simulate widescreen. Faces are squished (short and fat). On top of that, it is still pan and scanned. I could not watch more than 5 minutes. ""Unwed Mother"" is watchable, but it is a matted presentation of a full frame print. Chins and foreheads are frequently chopped off by the matting. Absolutely horrible DVD presentation from VCI.",1216857600,8,424,4.821917808219178
8113479,3,B000EQHX7S,"Norma Moore and Robert Vaughn do fine considering the material they have to work with in Unwed Mother, that is, if you can believe TV's handsome hero in ""Man From Uncle"" is well cast as a thief/gigilo father of the baby. He's just not mean enough to be ""smearing"" every sweet young thing he touches like his landlady says.  The theme song is a bit corny even for 1960. Robert resorts to robbing a movie theatre to pay back the salary our girl in trouble loans him (a forgivable crime at 2008 prices!)The second half of the film improves where we finally discover Moore is pregnant and must live in a home for other single moms on probation. She won't give up her baby even then..but couldn't the older couple adopt both her and the baby?  Extras subtract from a badly miscast film when Bob Justman uses all his time to talk about Patrick Stewart in Star Trek.",1203465600,3,859,4.430379746835443
8113480,2,B000EQHX7S,"This black and white film - I am reviewing only TOO SOON TO LOVE - is an earnest production following in the footsteps of REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE in exploring the newly permissive world of the American teenager.  The plot is very simple. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, she gets pregnant, they plan abortion, she attempts suicide, he steals money, they reconcile and bravely face the world together.

The print in this double feature dvd runs 81 minutes, not the 88 minutes claimed for the film on IMDB.  Richard Evans does a perfect James Dean impersonation - he has the facial expressions, the vocal mannerisms, the hand and body movements down to a ""t.""  It's an earnest though not great performance.  The young actress who plays the girl is competent.

It's fun to see a very young Jack Nicholson as a sleaze who forces himself on our heroine at a drive-in.  A fight ensues between Evans and Nicholson.  He's in it for about five minutes total.

Competent film of its era but only B grade.",1197849600,,994,4.570621468926554
8113481,4,B000EQHX7S,"I was expecting exploitation films, but these are well-made dramas, and it is nice to see 50's B movies that are so sharp and clear...widescreen, too.  Robert Vaughn is a wonderful cad.  Interesting commentary track by Robert Justman who was assistant director on the movie.  Of course, he went on to to Star Trek fame, and tends to talk more about S.T. than ""Unwed Mother.""  That's fine by me.",1149984000,7,394,4.666666666666667
