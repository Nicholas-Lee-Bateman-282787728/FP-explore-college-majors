8285565,4,B0010WS06I,"This DVD contains three Christmas-themed episodes from the Golden Age of Television.

1. Ozzie & Harriet - ""Busy Christmas"" (Dec. 19, 1956)
2. The Ray Bolger Show (aka Where's Raymond) - ""Christmas Show"" (Dec. 24, 1953)
3. The Jack Benny Show - ""Talent Show"" (Dec. 30, 1956)

Truth to tell, the episode of the Jack Benny Show isn't really a Christmas show, since it was filmed after Christmas, but he talks about it enough to warrant its inclusion.  Granted, his other Christmas shopping episodes are more festive, this one is a hoot by itself, and even has an appearance by Jayne Mansfield!

All in all this is a nice addition to anyone's collection of classic television.",1263168000,,673,4.775862068965517
