This is an original American Sesame Street product that has been dubbed over with very fast, incomprehensible French translations, which were barely recognizable. I speak French, so I know what I am talking about. You almost need captions with this video. At one point when a singer sang a song, it was so obvious that the words did not match her lips and this is very confusing for children. Don't waste your money on this. I'd like to recommend some better French videos for toddlers and children, but I have yet to find a quality authentic one. You can find some better (songs) on Youtube for free.",1514073600,,667,4.61344537815126
