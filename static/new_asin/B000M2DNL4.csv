8165680,5,B000M2DNL4,This is an excellent training tape/partner.  If  studied Norhern Praying Mantis with an good Sifu you will love this one.,1387929600,,121,5.0
8165681,3,B000M2DNL4,"First off...this is clearly a form in the most elementary state of preying mantis.  The system has become much more evolved since leaving the shaolin temple, it seems.  This form reflects what it USED to look like.  The stances are very redundant, and the moves are done mostly one at a time.  Later evolved seven star mantis has forms where you do 3 moves in one step.  Easily, there are places where it could be combined to be more intricate.  It's in the simplest and rawest state with this video.

Secondly, lets address the setup, here.  They teach it in 4 segments.  They have you going to the left, first.  That's one segment of moves.  Then you turn and go to the right.  That's the second section of moves.  Then you turn around again and go left.  That's the third.  The final section goes to the right again.  And then you finish.  That's all very well.  But then there is the form in its completion.  And you do it all the way through at the end.  Somehow...they've added on two extra segments!!  And they didn't teach it to us!  I can clearly see when I pause the tape what they are doing.  More or less, they are just going in there and repeating segments 3 and 4 again.  Tacking them on at the end before the finish.  But it's not very precise.  And there are a couple of movements that they teach in the first segment that are NOT what the monk is doing.  YOu have to slow the tape down to see that he kind of glides right over a technique in there and it is frustrating.  It's not that he is just executing it quickly, either.  It's that he's doing something ELSE!

I found these inconsistencies off putting....but other than that, it's a good beginner form, I suppose.)",1365552000,,1687,4.348387096774194
