8135583,5,B000H0M45C,"This dvd is a great introduction to one of Los Angeles' best kept secrets. Unfortunately, I didn't discover it until a week before I moved from LA. But I am so happy that I did get to visit. Actually now that I think about it, I believe you should wait and view this dvd after you visit the Museum of Jurassic Technology if possible. It is so much about the experience and the surprises that you discover. Part art installation and part museum it is worth the trip and the dvd will give you just enough insight to maintain the wonder.",1212624000,,534,4.297029702970297
