But this MAGNIFICENT DVD is like the materialization of everything I have read about. Even travelling to Berlin (which I have done) cannot communicate how it was for people through the years have taken care enough to erase to the last vestige of the old Berlin.
Perhaps because English is not my native language I find myself unable to give you an idea how good this DVD is but if you have an interest about the pre and nazi German architecture, this DVD will fulfill your wildest imaginations.",1329782400,6,617,4.5675675675675675
