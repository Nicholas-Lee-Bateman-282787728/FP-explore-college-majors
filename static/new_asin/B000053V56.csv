1390543,2,B000053V56,"Earthian is a cunningly presented trap -- and I fell for it, hook, line and sinker. To quote a sentence from the back of the DVD: ""Two angels descend from the heavens, their purpose is to judge humanity -- and each other."". The summary on the video's case gives you the impression that this anime is an all-encompassing heaven and earth epic. Hah! Earthian is anything but that, I tell you. I fell asleep five times trying to finish the four episodes that make up the Earthian Angelic Collection. The characters are bland, the pacing is a drag, and the plot is a mess. The episodes are loosely connected, which makes it difficult to integrate the events as a whole. If anything, this anime is all about Chihaya and his hang-up / angst about his black wings. Kagetsuya just pops up to rescue Chihaya from whatever trouble he gets himself into. That's it, and it's stretched out into four eps that seem to last forever. There's also a gay love scene between the two angels that seems out of place. I mean, the story doesn't even give the slightest impression that Kagetsuya and Chihaya are lovers, so imagine my surprise when the next scene featured the two naked in bed. Yes, Chihaya is a he, even if he looks and acts a lot like a she. The art and animation are basically okay. The angelic cast look quite majestic in their full angel forms, but the non-angels look so-so at best. Whatever happened to the part where the angels are supposed to judge humanity? Beats the heck out of me.",1001203200,2,1485,4.503703703703704
1390544,4,B000053V56,"^.^ I thought this story would be about the angels and how the we humans are judged. Um, no. Wrong. It's about Chihaya and his partner Kagetsuya. There's a plot line, and yeah you get stories about angels judgeing humans and the world being saved and destroyed and all that. But really it's the character and relationship develpment with the two main cast members. It was my first DVD I bought, and I was quiet thrilled. I'm a rabid yaoi fan girl and I thought little Chihaya would only give hints and leave me guessing. But nope, they even sleep in the same bed. So yep, I'm happy! ^.^ What next... Kizuna or Fake? Hmm...",997401600,5,622,4.417391304347826
1390545,3,B000053V56,"I bought this movie because of the music video on the Elf Princess Rane tape.  It looked cool, so I bought it.  I read up on it and....egh, YAOI (2 guys in love).  It was very well animated and I guess the manga was excellent, but PLEASE, save your self some money and don't buy it.  If you are a SERIOUS Earthian fan, then go right ahead, but if you haven't read the manga, I don't suggest you getting this.  Rent it or something, its not worth the buy.  BTW--that music video is REALLY decieving, it makes the anime look REAL good, doesn't it?  I LOVE THAT SONG!",994896000,,564,4.166666666666667
1390546,3,B000053V56,"Having watched this for the first time, I must say that I would definitely not recommend it to anyone who is new to anime.  Although the animation is good, and the music is better, the story - as has been stated in previous reviews - is not very easy to follow.  There are a few holes, and I thought the description on the back of the DVD was slightly misleading in that I expected this to ultimately deal with something akin to the end of the world in a supernatural sense (Armageddon?).  I was totally unprepared for the homosexual implications introduced in the story, although I was not disturbed by that.  The character development is good, particularly for the two main characters, but some of the other characters were merely introduced and then abandoned.  In conclusion, this is not an anime for everyone.  For newbies, I would recommend something lighter - ""The Vision of Escaflowne"", for example.  (There are angel-like beings in that one, if you're looking for angels.)  ""Earthian"" left me with an incomplete feeling, and I wish I had known how disjointed this story was before investing in this DVD.",989884800,,1112,4.755208333333333
1390547,4,B000053V56,"Though I've only seen the first part to this series, many questions arose in my mind. For example, is Chihaya yaoi (gay) or just very feminine? He's definitely not a woman, but he was drawn with the large eyes that are used for females in anime. The English dub also gives him a high voice, though it's noticibly male, which is a good thing. He's very sensitive to humans (as well as the humanoids he encounters), and the yaoi fangirl in me became suspicious when Chihaya seemed to have a slight crush on Taki, the dashing Aqua-haired humanoid (Who, by the way, is pretty cute for an anime guy). However, when Chihaya was captured, he called for Kagetsuya, his angelic partner, and noticibly blushed for a few seconds when the handsome blonde angel kissed a wound in his chest to heal it. Perhaps it's just that angels have no preference in this sort of thing, but a fangirl can always hope, can't she?? See it!",988761600,,911,4.527272727272727
1390548,4,B000053V56,"I just finished watching this anime and I have to say that I enjoyed it and I am not a fan of shojo anime. The story involves Angels sent down from Eden to decide the fate of Earth. The characters were designed with an amazing amount of detail along with the backdrop. The second story was a bit weak but it was still enjoyable. However, there is a huge gap between the second and the third stories, so pay close attention or you might be confused. The characters were developed rather well, except that Chihaya's character (one of the main ones) was extremely annoying, but that made him hilarious at the same time. I couldn't stop laughing, so it was forgivable. All in all, the anime was very good.",988416000,2,701,4.441860465116279
1390549,4,B000053V56,"A very well done series for the time that it was made.  It's got a fresh look into the angel insight, as well as good voice actors in both languages.  I must say I was very pleased to watch this.  Though this story is not for beginners, and some may loose the plot around shaded areas, it's a good anime.  Just get some background information before you watch this, it might help.  If you like the CLAMP's style, than this series might be for you.  Though to warn you, the subtitles do NOT match the English voices.  This is a good thing. Trust me.

1390550,4,B000053V56,"The three tape Earthian OAV (Original Animated Video) series is based off of a shoujo (girl's) manga series by Yun Kouga.  The story is about angels who live on Eden and who have been watching over the Earth and the Earthians (humans)to determine the fate of the Earth along with the Earthians.  Pairs of investigators are sent to Earth to study the activities of the Earthians.  Each team is made up of a plus checker and a negative checker.  This OAV series follows the lives of two angels, Chihaya (a plus checker) and Kagetsuya (a negative checker).
  Chihaya an angel who was born abnormal with black hair and black wings feels a strong affection for the Earth and the Earthians.  His affection leads him to become personally involved in the lives of Earthians. As a result he meets two bio-humaniods, Taki and Takako who have escaped from the cruel hands of a mad scientist.  Chihaya's encounter with the two compromises both angel investigators safety and causes the Earthians to become aware of the presence of angels among them.
This is a very unique, stylish, and fun anime series that all anime fans should own.",983404800,10,1122,4.747422680412371
7930159,2,B000053V56,"I picked this up because I've heard lots of references to it, and it has a strong fan following.  It's apparently something of a classic.

Well, I'll say this... part of being a classic is age, and ""Earthian"" shows it.  For viewers more familiar with CG and 3D rendered anime (I.G Production, Gonzo, etc.), the animation quality will disappoint.  Most of the scenes freeze at the end, with dialogue still going on, and the segues from one mjaor scene to another are pretty much full-stop-then-play, not the smooth blending we've become accustomed too.

Dub-wise, this was put together, if I read the dates right, just when English-speaking voice actors were beginning to get their 'sea legs' so to speak, so quality varies.  Can't say the sub version impressed me all that much either.

Chihaya, the black-haired angel, proved the major drawback for me.  Supposedly a powerful angel in his own right, he gets captured repeatedly and seems unable to do anything but kick his feet and scream for his partner's help when he's in a hold that he should be able to break out of.  I won't call it 'girly' behavior because it's an insult to girls.  (And his wailing and cringing is just as bad in Japanese, so the dub can't be blamed.)

The story concepts are rather dated as well.  Sci-fi elements that seem quite funny, which is too bad as they're meant to be serious and tragic, and Big Bad Military themes.

Despite this, the characterizations are good for their time.  If they ever decide to re-master/issue a special edition to bring things up to a modern audience's expectations, it might very well be a better OVA.  Until then, the appeal of this OVA will most likely be yaoi or anime completeists, or pop culture historians who enjoy noting how a form of entertainment evolves over time.",1140134400,7,1788,4.72258064516129
7930160,4,B000053V56,"First of all, a warning: If you have NOT read the manga and/or have NOT done some research of your own by reading fansites, etc., then do not be surprised if you come out confused at the end of the video. The main reason for this is probably that this ""Angelic Collection"" is indeed a collection. When Earthian was first adapted from manga to anime, it came out as four separate OVAs. However, later on AnimeWorks came along and took all four, compiling them into one DVD together...

OVA 1: Beginning of the End

This was the first Earthian OVA to be released, and at the end credits after OVA 4 you will see that its copyright date is fairly earlier than the other three. The art in here is different than OVAs 3 and 4, and sports the signature retro-style of earlier anime titles.

This OVA introduces the main concept of the Earthian series, which is the Judgement system of Positives and Negatives, and the fact that if the humans recieve a large quantity of negative marks then Planet Eden will rule Humans out as a destructive, evil, race unfit to maintian possession of Earth, the most beautiful planet in the universe. If Eden does happen to come to this conclusion, they will have no other choice than to kill off the entire human race.

Unfortunately, this OVA does not focus all that much on the angels' task of Judging. Rather, we are drawn into a plot where two bio-human lovers who have escaped from a lab are trying to gain their freedom and independance. Chihaya and Kagetsuya try to help the bio-humans, but then Chihaya is captured by the scientist who created the bio-humans, a man named Dr. Ashino, who wants to run tests on Chihaya to find out more about his beautiful black wings.

I found this one to be mediocre, and though it started out promising in the beginning, as the story progressed, I lost my enthusiasm in what was going on. The ending theme, ""Mother"" was beautiful and delicate, a sweet and satisfactory ending that fit into my perception of what Earthian music should sound like.

Shonen-ai Content: 3/5. When Kagetsuya goes in to save Chihaya from Dr. Ashino's lab, he finds his partner with a wound on his chest. He kisses the place to make the wound disappear and Chihaya blushes.

OVA 2: Fallen Angel

This OVA takes us away from the events of OVA 1 for a moment. We are introduced to three other angels: Miyagi, a male positive angel like Chihaya; Aya, a female negative angel with a crush on Kagetsuya; and Sapphire, a.k.a. Cliff, a former Seraphim who is now a Fallen Angel or ""Lucifer"" that was exiled from Planet Eden due to a form of cancer that turned his wings and hair black.

Chihaya, who has been having nightmares about his black hair and wings, decides that he wants to hunt down this ""Sapphire"" to find out whether or not his dark attributes are cancer or just a natural trait. As usual, he ends up getting involved with everyone else's problems and for a while forgets about his own worries.

This one was pretty good, though I can't say why without giving away the climax.

Shonen-ai content: 2/5. At the end, Chihaya asks Kagetsuya if he would come and comfort him were Chihaya to suddenly fall ill and start dying. Kagetsuya sort of pulls Chihaya into his lap and tells him not to be ridiculous; that he isn't sick. Nothing too showy here, but you can at least kind of get the idea that these two are in love.

OVA 3: Angelic Destroyer

My favorite of the four. This is where things really start to pick up.

Chihaya and Kagetsuya are on a mission to save two young angels who were kidnapped and are being interrogated by Dr. Ashino (yes, the same guy from OVA 1, but older and crazier). After splitting up from Kagetsuya, Chihaya takes a turn somewhere deep into the lab where he sees a sleeping figure; a black-winged angel just like him: Messiah. In an attempt to get Messiah's attention, Chihaya reveals his angel form so that the other angel can see. Messiah awakens to see the change and this information becomes incrypted into his memories, eventually forming in him a ""heart"" of sorts. Although Messiah was intended to care only for destruction and power, his love for Chihaya is strong enough to overpower any influence that Dr. Ashino holds over him.

As I said, this was my favorite Earthian OVA. The ending theme, ""True Romance"" by Maki Ichihara, was SUPERB. I was so overwhelmed by its beauty the first time I heard it that I burst into tears.

Shonen-ai content: 5/5: We have a bed scene between Kagetsuya and Chihaya (I won't go into details, but suffice to say that they don't go all the way), and plus there's the fact that Messiah is obsessed with Chihaya in a way that can't be anything but love.

OVA 4: Final Battle

Here we see Messiah again, and he is hell-bent on finding Chihaya. Dr. Ashino also reappears and by this time he has become QUITE annoying. VERY MUCH SO. We also have a bit of bloodshed here. This episode is maybe the most violent and hardcore out of the entire series.

The ending theme, ""The Destinies"", also by Maki Ichihara, is lively and adds a semi-happy note into the end of the OVA, probably to signify that everything has been resolved and now things will be alright.

Shonen-ai Content: 3.5/5. We have some exceedingly mushy scenes between Messiah and Chihaya and although they don't kiss or anything, Messiah does once acknowledge Chihaya to be his ""special someone"". And, oh! what's this? Could Kagetsuya be jealous?

Anyway, after reading all of this, if you really want to get into this and find out exactly what was missing and why some things seemed to just hang in midair, you're in luck. Tokyopop has announced that it has licensed the Earthian manga, which will probably be coming out sometime around September 2005.",1116633600,40,5732,4.583577712609971
7930161,1,B000053V56,"It seems not.  I suppose if you follow this from the manga you might love seeing your characters come to life, but for someone who has never read it and does not know the preexisting story, this DVD was one giant ""WTF?"" moment.  The story is exceptionally disjointed; it seems to be jumping randomly forward in time while leaving out the actual reasons for the characters actions.  Moments such as planet Eden deciding Earth must be destroyed and shooting off a laser are followed by something totally unconnected with a line that mentions that one of the main characters saved the world.  Huh?  The actual art is well done, although the music would surely be welcome on an elevator - it lacks energy.  In all, if you are a current follower of this in the manga, you might love it... otherwise too much of the between story is missing for it to be a complete story.",1103673600,6,865,4.512820512820513
7930162,4,B000053V56,"Okay, two points to make here. One, if you don't like shonen-ai (um... boy love) too much, then this won't be too bad for you. There's only one really gross scene, but it's so short, I don't see how it can be offensive. Two, if you really like the really lovish scenes where they kiss a lot and all that, then this won't really help you much. As I said, the only time I saw them kiss was this one time in the third episode, Fallen Angel. The art's okay, and it reminds me a lot of Gravitation, meaning it's totally kawaii- cute. I trust Yun Kouga, and I totally trust this show. I liked it, but it didn't really stick to the whole Judgement theme they depicted... The plot pretty much circulates over particular peoples throughout... You decide if you really wanna go through with this one.",1082073600,14,790,4.344594594594595
7930163,4,B000053V56,"The reason I first got this box set was because I heard from a friend that it had shonnen-ai (boy's love) in it. I was a bit dissapointed, for the romance didn't really come until the third episode, but it was still good. Earthian is only four episodes. It's about two angels; one has to record the bad side of humans, and the other the good. Then there's a main plot going through the four episodes, with side plots to make everything more spaced out (in my oppinion).
I would recommend this if you wanted it for the story, but if you were like me and only got it for the boy's love, then I'd say get something else.",1068508800,10,617,4.19327731092437
7930164,5,B000053V56,"Well this movie is in fact a shounen ai. But it hardly shows it. The main character tells his fellings to the other main character, and all he gets is a hug. There is a 2 sec kissing scene and well, thats about it for the shounen ai part. But the story line is really good, but it went too fast even thought each epasode seemes to go on forever b/c so much stuff happens.
Well the main character wants to know why his hair is black, and why he has black wings. So whenever he sees others black haired and winged angels, they're not like him. They either have cancer that turned their hair and wings black, or they were creations. So people start to wonder if hes a Lucifer. He meets enimies that become friends that become enimies that become friends again. And then the friends die. There are 4 eps. each containing a diff story with  the same characters. And of caorse the ending is all happy, but short. But over all, its a pretty good anime for being so old. ^.^;",1062288000,6,967,4.227027027027027
7930165,3,B000053V56,"when i first heard of this anime, i thoiught it sounded really cool. i saw the first 2 eps a few summers ago. i rented it from a blockbuster store. the art and story line wasn't too bad, but i was a little dissapointed. there was no romantic plot taht was overly noticable. then a friend of mine bought this dvd collection, and brought it to a sleepover party. there was a noticable difference from the ealier eps and the newer ones. i greatly enjoyed the newer ones. the art was much better. my fave eps was the last one. the sex scene between the two male angels was short and very angsty, leaving me wanting more. but overall, it was a good anime.",1046908800,2,650,4.25
7930166,4,B000053V56,"First of all you must know that what you have here is not precisely what it says. The main plot, the earthian's judgment take a secondary place, and what you have here it's more the relationship between the characters and Chihaya's (the black angel) situation.
  These episodes cover all the anime made. The first two were made on 1989 and the other two in 1996, so the difference is clear; also the plot style. Even so that all of the episodes are dramatic and tragic, the first two deals with more drama than the last two, these ones are more on the action side.
  In order to enjoy it, know this, these aren't episodes with continuity, so you won't have here a whole story, what you get is 3 different stories of this same universe, the only ones related are the last 2.
  Other thing, the series has a a yaoi element; boys' love. It can shock, especially, since it's not until the 3rd episode that you know this.
  If you can tolerate that and the failures it has, you're going to have a good, very tragic series.",1013558400,3,1017,4.372340425531915
7930167,4,B000053V56,"This is another great yaoi anime, it has angels and yaoi, what else do you want or need? lol but seriously it's very moving and although the whole Messiah deal gets on my nerves to no end (i hate him!, Chihaya and Kagetsuya forever) i still love it",1010793600,,248,4.1875
7930168,5,B000053V56,"Ok so Earthian as an OAV might not be the best thing out there, but for the time it was made (which is early 90's or late 80's I don't remember) it's a great anime. Certainly there aren't many indications of a concrete story, and the characters can seem cliche at times, but I still loved it.
The quality of animation far surpassed some of the more popular anime being sold currently, of which I shall not even mention *turns green*. And I do thoroughly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read the manga yet, in fact I'd say to watch this then read the manga, you'd have a steady introduction to the cast.
And about the whole ""angel"" and ""heaven"" theme, I think the mangaka said that the original idea was to have the people with wings as an alien race, who live on a different planet called Eden. And by watching humans and their behavioural patterns, they could basically decide whether to leave us alone, or stop our growth so that it doesn't harm their planet.",1009411200,4,963,4.415730337078652
