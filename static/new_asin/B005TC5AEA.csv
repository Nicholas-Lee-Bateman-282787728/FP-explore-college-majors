4888493,5,B005TC5AEA,"Not an entertainment, decidedly. An abominable story that needed to be told. After a book by a female American police officer who spent some time as a member of the US contingent in the UN Peacekeeping Force in Bosnia after the recent war. Played brilliantly by Rachel Weisz, whom I do not always find as convincing as here.
Kathy is actually employed by a private security firm based in England. (This abomination of employing private firms for public jobs is a whole separate subject; the US government has a lot to answer for in this respect.) Her employer has a contract with the State Department. When she takes the job she expects to find herself among an elite police corps. In reality she finds herself among a bunch of thugs. Corruption and cynicism dominate the outlook of her colleagues.

She finds herself confronted with the plight of victims of sexual slavery: young girls from all kinds of countries (Ukraine and Chechnya are specially mentioned) are held in brothels that cater to the foreign troops and other internationals. She tries to help and promises safety to those who will speak up. When she starts making efforts against the system, she runs into stiff opposition and gets finally shafted by her employer without a chance to help the victims. Her only victory is in a BBC supported publicity campaign against the practices that she discovered.

Is this story an argument against the UN? I don't think so. It is an argument against war and peacekeeping forces and against employing private companies for military or police functions.
As the cynical UN country chief of the story says: prostitution in war happens. He lives the pragmatic wisdom that eggs must be broken for the production of omelettes. Abominable man, and probably taken from real life on a one to one scale.
 It is unrealistic to expect soldiers on peacekeeping missions to behave differently from men in masses under war conditions. Unrealistic. Is it an argument against the UN system? Hardly. It is an argument against wars and peacekeeping and turning war into private business. The non-military UN agencies have no influence whatsoever on the military units and should not be confused with them.",1321833600,2,2192,4.934959349593496
4888494,5,B005TC5AEA,"The Whistleblower is one of those important movies that are almost too disturbing to watch, because it depicts a violent reality none of us really want to know much about. And, it happens ""over there"", in another country and continent... In this case, the story is set in post-war Bosnia, with UN Peacekeepers tasked to keep the hostile fighters apart and, most importantly, protect and give new hope to the innocent local population. Most of the actors and perpetators here are working for one of the private companies, contracted to do the work for the insufficiently staffed UN contingent. One US police officer, Kate, bit by bit discovers a net of of betrayal, corruption and criminality linked to a brutal trafficking ring of girls, brought illegally over the border under the eyes of UN personnel, so that they can ""serve"" the police and military in whatever way the men enjoy. Can Kate enlist support and convince the UN office to launch legal action or will she remain a lonely fighter? And if so, will she have the strength and persistence to expose the perpetrators? Based on the real-life experiences of Kathryn Bolkovac, who has written a book about it as well and cooperated with the film, this is in many ways a must-see movie. Yes, it is harrowing, and yes, it is difficult to watch (I saw it on the big screen last night) and the ending is not necessarily what we would hope to see happen in the future with similar scenarios in other places, but, unless we understand what is being discussed here, we cannot argue for change.

4888498,5,B005TC5AEA,"If Rachel Weisz hadn't already made it, this would have been her breakthrough role. This is one of the top 5 movies I've watched this year, and definitely the best drama I've seen. It makes it more incredible that this is all based on 100% true events and the main character, Kathryn Bolkovac, still remains blackballed from employment because she blew the whistle on a corrupt United Nations. Monica Bellucci is excellent as usual and Vanessa Redgrave and David Strathairn also delivery impressive and convincing performances. This DVD is excellent also. No extras, but solid picture and sound. Highly highly recommended",1318204800,10,621,5.158415841584159

Rachel Weisz is excellent and she brings depth to the film, adding to its ever-present dramatic occurrences. You will find yourself invested in the outcome, and hopeful for the culprits to be held accountable. Not every ending is a happy one, which adds to the film's realism.

HEAR YE, HEAR YE....A TRUE STORY ABOUT LIFE AND AFTER-WAR TRAGEDIES.....A CLEAR PICTURE OF ''THE OTHER SIDE'' AND MILES AWAY FROM HUMANITY'S  PEACE AND LOVE AND GLORIOUS, HEROIC, AND FABULOUS MANHOOD.

THIS IS NO FAIRYTALKE.  IT IS A TOOL FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS TO USE TO TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE.
THIS MOVIE IS AN ALL-STAR PRESENTATION.  THE PERFORMERS PUT THEIR HEARTS AND SOULS INTO THIS PRESENTATION.
THANK YOU....THANK YOU....THANK YOU....

One criticism:  that line in the script when the mother tells her daughter, ""You have graduated high school.  You are an adult now.
You can do what you want to do.''  The daughter stopped and thought about it ...then ran out into the night into the arms of the traffictor.
I'm thinking it's a rare parent who makes a mistake like that.  Most parents would have been, ""Bring me one-o'clock again and you better be moving.""  Being grown is not about staying out late.  It's about getting your own place and paying your own rent.  Then something wonderful happens....you've taken your first '''adult''' steps.

This movie is the reason WHY a lot of parents do everything they can to move their child from their house to the college dorm.
Still.  Some tragic stories emerge from that plan to keep their daughter safe.

4888536,1,B005TC5AEA,"Here again. I will not be reviewing this in my normal method. It is obviously not for anyone under the age of 18, some even 25.

The 1 Star Rating is so people can find my review better. Read through.
The reason I say, no one under the age of 18, is because we are supposed to protect them from needing to see this. Their time will come when they must do the same and hopefully they were raised by good parents.

It is common knowledge that this movie is almost perfect and should be mandatory for every single man and woman in government to watch. The 1 Star Rating was click bait. Look past the movie and get to the heart of the true story. Yes, this movie displays brilliant and honest depictions of language barrier and men who should have all faced the death penalty. And those who can't understand it, well, you chose a different venture in life, but you cannot deduct star for lack of experience. Who cares about the production of the movie? Did you miss the whole freaking movie? Is someone that insensitive to life and should be evaluated? I have spent two years in South Korea, 4 months in Haiti, and 7 months in Afghanistan. My service time was 5 years Army Military Police (been awarded an AFSM, a Combat Action Badge, Army Commendation Medal, and a Valorous Unit Award, to just name several), I have a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice: Criminal Psychology from Liberty University, I am a Wall Street Journal Young Professional, Life Coach Certified and Accredited, an Amazon Author, a member of the Christian Association for Psychological Studies, and a non-profit board member. With that, I promise everyone, American U.S. Departments could care less about women, just as this movie shows. They allow the military personnel to dabble in Prostitution in Korea, day after day. They know it happens, thousands of people know it (everyone who has served in Korea, knows). Any paid services for male mental satisfaction from women, is legally prostitution. Where else does it happen, with U.S. money and DOD, DOT, DOE, etc. identification? Why do you think certain places put their businesses outside of military bases IN the United States? Drugs, sex trafficking, and legal business are the three largest options. Turning the other way, is not ""enforcing law"", it should be charged with 20 years in prison. The CIA is 10 years, minimum, ahead of the normal populace, in technology and warfare. Are we dense? Human Trafficking can be ended in 1 or 2 years, globally (there are more U.S. forces than trafficked women around the world). But, men pay to torture women and other men are so emotionally and psychologically lethargic, they say, ""It was a good movie. Most women want to be there and are not tortured at least twice a week. The end. I guess I'll watch the Transformers now, for a laugh, before I lay down to my bed with no worries and I never think about what women are being forced to do, right this very moment, as I can freely choose my next move. How many tears must be cried, by these women, every two days? When was the last time I cried? It was a family tragedy, not an endless array of heartless men who are addiction to violence and bleeding flesh."" And never think of what it feels like to LIVE EVERYDAY BEING SEXUALLY TORTURED. 4 million women can tell you. Another 5 million dead women can, in the span of what, 70 years?

Oh, well. Caring comes with action, not the ignorant ""innocent until a hidden camera shows the event, because neuropsychologists are not really good at knowing brain behavior and should not be trusted to detect when a man says something stupid to cover himself, from justice""...

Welcome to the world, hopefully you all only birth boys. One less thing you have worry the rest of your life about. Liberty mattered more than safety, back in the days when men had reason to fear justice and their ethical neighbor. Now, no one is scared of law.

The film very accurately depicts the true account of trafficking in women in Bosnia (BiH) and Kosovo. Women were moved from place to place for prostitution and general ""bar girl"" work. Some men both European and American as part of the IPTF facilitated the movement, incarceration and facilitation.

I spent a total of 45 months in the Balkans up and to the completion of the air war in Kosovo early June of 1999.

These ""crimes against humanity"" while working under the UN mandate as part of the IPTF Mission were minimized or dismissed which led to the woman depicted in the film's employment termination.  She did sue in the UK and was awarded money...how much..I cannot recall.

The contracting company hired by the US State Department for employment as an IPTF monitor was Dyncorp, now owned by the Cerberus Capital Management, LLC.  Dyncorp had a major portion of the Iraqi training mission and is responsible for a major portion of logistics in support of the mission in Afghanistan.

Hard hitting film

I know there are many of you out there who believe that these anti-UN tales are just so much Trump Admin driven propaganda to make him look good!  Well, the UN has been up to vileness and anti-productive behavior since before Trump was just another arrogant, blustering fool from the hotbed of arrogant blustering fools, NYC, who was massively wealthy from his construction business.

It is an account of the soul killing experience of Gen.

He himself became enlightened to how the UN worked while in that position and bears a lot of scars.

One of the frustrations there was that too many people (victims, smugglers, traffickers, workers, spoke WAY too much English (and good English) and much of the dialogue should have had to go through interpreters who can also be ""bought"" or intimidated.  This shows the nature of blatant corruption associated with the United Nations that has been going on since the beginning of the Cold War.  Personally I was shocked that she was not executed because it would have been so easy to do and the UN and the ""contracting company"" certainly would have no serious interest in genuine police work.  I suspect much was withheld from being portrayed due to the utterly complete depravity generally well told in this movie.  I doubt many could handle the harder hitting graphic truth of human trafficking.....  Anyone with a daughter between 15-30 should consider watching this movie with them.....not to scare them but to show them the possibilities of dealing with evil people....including relatives and relatives of friends.

Rachel Weisz is stellar as always, and she clearly chooses roles where she can play a noble character, which this woman certainly way.  However, the film itself was lacking.  First, it needed more light.  While making every scene nearly completely black did set a somber mood, it also interfered with the telling of the story because you simply couldn't see what was going on.  The scenery was also nearly absent.  Every scene was just a cement room, whether indoors or outdoors.  Also, the film felt unfinished, because we never got to see her reunite with her daughter, who was the reason she was doing that work in that first place.

4888665,4,B005TC5AEA,"I can't give this movie 5 stars because clicking on 5 stars said ""Loved It"". I didn't love it. I thought it was well done. I was angry and disgusted. It fortified my belief that the UN should be shut down. The level of apathy and complicity within the ranking diplomats and the field workers is truly despicable. I thought this film handled the subject very well. It was engaging enough to make me research the background of the story and learn more about the horror of sex trafficking. The violence is rather graphic but appropriate for the subject matter. There is nothing nice or easy about the crimes (rape and murder) associated with sex trafficking. Don't look for a nice wrap up where all the bad guys got theirs in the end. This is not fiction and the facts are not that satisfying.",1485043200,,790,4.493055555555555
4888666,5,B005TC5AEA,"This is an excellent movie, but it's beyond belief that people can treat others in such degrading ways. What's even worse is, in this case the United Nations was complicit in covering up Human Trafficking. This makes my blood boil. I wise I could find a group of good sold people to start a private task force and stop this kind of thing, anywhere and everywhere. The powers to be won't do anything BECAUSE THEY'RE INVOLVED up to their eyeballs.

4888767,4,B005TC5AEA,"A female police officer in New York.  She was asking for a transfer because of her second marriage break-up.  Instead, she got a new job assignment and she accepted a U.N. Peacekeeper position in the war-torn Bosnia.  In the war, more than 50% men died.  Many wicked men
offered help to this economically poor community over-populated with women.  These men involved local mobs, policeman, soldiers and U.N.
staff.  A total corruption in the real truth of human trafficking.
She as a chief of this unit found out this fact and promised to bring it to court.  As understood, she did not have almighty political connection.
Her loyal followers were only a few.  Nearly to the end of this movie, she herself was instantly fired as a sure way to keep the corruption alive.
What happened next?  Equipped with a final lead, she brought her findings all the way to London which supervised the Bosnia Operation.
The End.  What was the aftermath?  The screen briefly informed viewers of arresting those wicked.  She could not find a similar international
job since then.",1482105600,,1061,4.833333333333333

The fact that the corrupion of UN officials and their contractors was so deeply engrained is dusturbing, as it appears to have been treated like so many cover-ups, particularly during and after its being discovered. The acting and direction are stunning, and the absence of scenes to appeal to a prurient audience is very much appreciated by this viewer. My only complaint is that the subtitling for the hearing-impaired also blocks the subtitling that is embedded in the film when one of the film's several languages is spoken.

Accurately depicts what really goes on in war stricken countries and the ugly details that no one wants to face about global peace-keeping organizations and gov't contractors in war zones.  It also shows how whistleblowers are treated - everything from threats to being blacklisted and unable to find work.

Rachel was exceptional in this film.  I'm sure she was pained in her real life experience learning of these tragic and sadistic facts while preparing for this role.  Let it be known that governments and religions are complicit in the cover-ups of Human Trafficking.  This movie captures the soul of this ongoing and heinous crime estimated to include about 2.5 million people worldwide whom are mostly young girls.

Tell people about this.  Let others know when you suspect involvement or exploitation in the form of 'Businessman trips to the Far East' for example.  The girls are held as sex slaves for profit and though many will do this to other men's daughters, they would commit murder to protect their own.

This isn't the typical movie of a person who experiences trials and travails in exposing evil to the world, but finally the person triumphs and prevails.  If you google the lady and her present situation, she basically is still not allowed to work in international law enforcement.  So on one hand you just have this story about this evil evil trafficking of prostitutes, and on the other hand, in the real world, you have a woman who has been punished at somewhere near the severity of a disgruntled employee.

The good news is that this movie points out an extremely nasty situation which needs to be investigated to the hilt.

There were some disturbing images that really made me think about what it must be like for many trafficked females and males in this world.

Unfortunately people are still doing that because of how terrible it is. I'm so glad they made this engaging movie to help bring attention to such a horrible issue still going on today. This is what is posted about the film online in regards to the violent content...

In my opinion, the reason why they commit these crimes, is for the love of money, yes, money. The evidence is reported but nothing changes and it continue. Emotion is building (rage).

This is an uncomfortable but necessary tale of what has been going on throughout the many war ravaged nations and the aftermath that results in the exploitation of mostly young and pre-teen women in the sex trafficking industry. Sadly, many of our so called heroes participate in this disgrace and their superiors know full well what is going on in what is an ever growing world wide business. Not surprisingly, this film was not given the accolades or showing that it deserves. If you are reading this and other reviews that rightly recommend it be viewed, be forewarned.

4889566,4,B005TC5AEA,"After having watched this movie and then researched the real story, I was impressed by the story-telling and accuracy in parts. I do wish, however, that they had not embellished events in a story that really didn't need them.
Yet, this was a really solid movie about an issue that needs to be handled, especially since the UN was just caught making the same mistakes almost 20 years later.

Yet the ultimate result of the whistleblower's efforts was quickly abandoned as an afterthought just ahead of closing credits. Would have liked to see that developed.

Nevertheless, I select ""this story"" as the most harrowing of them all. Ironically, it is persuasive by not being overly graphic. But the discovery of the crime and the efforts of a lone crusader - a moral police woman - to try to stop this in Bosnia and protect the girls is truly gut wrenching.

Ms Weisz does an excellent job of portraying a sensitive, righteous soul who believes she has joined an organization to protect people after the war in Bosnia. But what she finds are the UN Contractors she works for involved in the trafficking of women in the most cruel and inhumane way.

I hate bullies and these evil men have made it an institution and unfortunately are never called to account. Meanwhile her character is jeered, and her life put into danger. Not for the easily depressed. The production itself is well done and conveys the dark and somber tone of the subject throughout.",1463443200,6,828,4.625850340136054

When we allow ourselves to become immune to the plight of the women portrayed in this film, when we ignore the fact that our government, and others, are allowing the perpetrators to, not only go unpunished, but to continue, I wonder what we are becoming as a race.  Is humanity doomed?  If we are no longer touched and moved to action by the knowledge that these things are happening, then maybe we are.  God help us all. I read that the original enactment of the punishment of one young girl had to be edited because during its initial showing a woman fainted, it makes me want to scream.

4889854,5,B005TC5AEA,"I'll say this right off the bat, if you do not have the stomach to watch a movie regarding human trafficking, then you won't be able to handle this movie. It's unfortunate that these atrocities happen throughout the world and even in the United States. This movie shows you just a glimpse of what human trafficking is life in one part of the world. This movie will show you that although the United States is against human trafficking, they'll turn a blind eye for an extra buck.

In terms of the movie, it is very graphic and at time very hard to watch. I'm a grown man, having served in the military and I found it difficult to watch at time, but I realized that if I wanted so see just a glimpse of what these girls go through, then I had to watch it. There's slight nudity and tons of swearing. I would not recommend this movie for children at all. If you're looking for your teenage daughter to see this, I would be very careful because it may be too much for her.

Overall, the movie was eye opening and something I would definitely recommend that people watch. The fact that this movie is based on actual events is both frightening and deeply saddening. If you're just looking for an action filled drama, then you'll definitely be entertained as this movie had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.",1463356800,13,1316,4.345528455284553

The film involves human trafficking and ghastly perversions perpetrated upon the victims of trafficking by men who make decent men ashamed to call themselves men.  It is very difficult to watch and may serve as a warning to parents who imagine because their children are 18 and considered adults that they have the wisdom that comes with age.

Working for food or shelter for ourselves is NOT helping the community, it is just saving our lives.
Almost all of us have smartphones, nice cars, living in nice apartments, cities and do NOT feel sorry, or help others. That is a shame, a total failure.
I do understand that we want to live a good life, but AT LEAST, we can do a little, and if we do, it will definitely help someone.
We do not have to spend a fortune, or put ourselves in poverty; we just need to do a little, whatever we can.

4890191,5,B005TC5AEA,"Rachel Weisz is one of the few stunning actresses who aren't getting by on looks alone.  She is a perfectionist and a master at the acting craft.  I am rarely disappointed by her acting renditions.  She carries Whistleblower single-handedly, delivering a soul-searching performance that is so gripping and suspenseful that she gives victims of sex trafficking a voice all over again.

At times hard to watch, the women in this movie do not hold back.  And Rachel is relentless in her search for a desperate girl named Raya to whom she made a promise that she may not be able to keep.

It is refreshing to see Monica Belluci. Her face-off with Weisz made me realise how much they resemble each other.  Jeanette Hain as Raya's grieving mother brings forth a performance that is heartbreaking and earnest.

A corrupt UN police officer shows up and his presences alone scares the sex workers. In yet another scene Rachel Weisz is glowered (Evil Eyed) at by male UN police officers. It takes place in the hallways of the UN headquarters. Subtle gang stalking at work. They are trying to freeze Rachel Weisz out of ""town."" Make her leave Sarajevo and Bosnia. Give up her job. (The corrupt UN police officers are really not that different from the leaders of the Interhamwe Militia in Hotel Rwanda, where the Interhamwe leader, George, also have women locked up and abused. The difference is the subtlety. The corrupt UN police officers are doing it in a hidden or covert way. George and his accomplices are doing it right out in the open. The chaotic circumstances covers their actions). One last scene worth mentioning in The Whistleblower is where Rachel Weisz is asking some male collegues questions at a cantine table.

One of the ending blurbs of the movie was the fact the US still uses private contractors like those depicted in the movie, in Iran and Afghanistan, and it brought to mind news stories in recent history concerning torture and abuse of ""prisoners of war.""  I was ashamed to be associated by country to those found guilty of these crimes, and this movie brought that same shame to the forefront of my mind.

The issue of human trafficking is difficult, at best, to realize and admit, but I think the directors and producers did a very good job of not getting bogged down in the ugly details.  The ethical issue is presented very well, and while it's hard to believe that one person could expose an entire ring of organized crime and effect change because of it, it does happen.

She gives a dramatic performance  in this story that exposes how money on a global level reduces the morality of corporations, government agencies, and programs designed to protect innocent victims of war torn countries.  The absolute evil that men and women will stoop to, the protection that is seen is toward the perpetrators of the crimes rather than for the victims.  To see young women captured, tortured, torn from their families and used to entertain such evil is a heartbreaking peek at reality at its very worst.  This story is a true depiction of actual events, and the results of the bravery of one women determined to expose this travesty. the way she was shunned and the lose of her job, the cost of the truth for standing up and doing the right thing is disturbing.

4890274,4,B005TC5AEA,"The Whistleblower was a surprising film based on real events.  Yes, it was a movie which, like many movies of real life events and circumstances, merged real-life circumstances into characters.  But it is a movie that also confronts issues of governmental and organization complicity in crimes against female children in post-war Bosnia.  Although governments (US, Britain, France) and international organizations (principally the United Nations) can claim that the intent of contracting services with private contractors was to support the redevelopment of Bosnia and to support Bosnians following the destructive war, the contractors in collusion with assigned government and organizational personnel allowed the human trafficking of young Bosnian girls for sex.  The story was based on the real life experiences of Kathryn Bolcovac, a Nebraska police woman who contracted with DynCorp International to support peace-keeping.  Her discovery of the complicity of the DynCorp contracted employees in the sex ring business for personal profit and gratification is depicted throughout the film.  Viewing the atrocities and horror of the unfolding circumstances,certainly is raises questions about the governmental oversight of contractors and policies that exclude contractors and/or employees from being prosecuted for crimes and acts committed in foreign nations.  It is a film that should be viewed by Senators, Congressmen and every member of their staffs in an effort to give understanding and to create policies to prevent these atrocities from recurring and to enable the prosecution of those contractors who enable the commitment of these crimes.",1392940800,,1652,5.773662551440329

Now she reverts to her police training...and in reality would be killed early on.  No further story. Her actions are unrealistic and would not be tolerated by any UN command.  She is off in left field on her own and would not survive.  It is so far out that you cannot get emotionally involved with the characters, any of them.

The gut wrenching stuff is what happens to the victims of the trafficking and infuriating too that the UN was so involved and enmeshed with the traffickers.

Not surprised by the corruption of the United Nations, but sad about America's involvement. We've lost our way as a nation of Truth and Justice, and of course we are starting to deal with the reality of the consequences.

It just dawned on me that the true story this movie is based on took place in 1999, just a year after Bill Clinton, President of the United States of America, was impeached for sexual indiscretion... must have made the sexual trafficking and exploitation of women all the more popular!",1388707200,,766,4.708955223880597

4890318,4,B005TC5AEA,"""The Whistleblower"" is by no means a great movie. It is still, however, well worth watching. Be advised that some of the scenes are shocking. Even though, as stated by both Rachel Weisz and director Larysa Kondracki, the sexual violence and events depicted were considerably toned down compared to the reality of what the young women depicted actually endured.

After watching this movie, I felt more angry than shocked. Angry that human trafficking and sexual slavery is so widespread. Shocked at the cruelty and brutality of it all.

When President George W. Bush took office in 2000, he made combating sexual slavery a priority.  Both within the US as well as abroad. Also in 2000, the US Congress passed The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act or TVPA. While Congress voted to renew the TVPA in 2004, 2006, and 2008 it did not do so in 2011.

Sexual trafficking, as well as other forms of human trafficking, isn't something that just happens in Eastern Europe. It happens every day in the US as well. The profits are immense, estimated as high as $32 billion annually worldwide. The victims are primarily young and defenseless women. It's not a problem that magically went away in 2011 when Congress failed to act. Shame on them, shame on us.",1388016000,,1261,4.824074074074074

4890331,5,B005TC5AEA,"Based on a true story, Whistleblower is a chilling film tracking the UN, US and Government Agencies involved in the sex trafficking rings in Bosnia during UN intervention in the late 90s. The film opens in Nebraska with Weisz as a divorced mother whose ex-husband has full custody of their daughter and is moving them to Georgia. Although Weisz is a hard working cop, shes unable to transfer to a department in Georgia where she can be closer to her daughter. A well paying opportunity comes up to work as a UN police officer and the movie then follows her to Bosnia where she fights tooth and nail to protect and get justice for the women being trafficked. Throughout the movie we see the religious and ethnic tensions in Bosnia (Sarajevo), the lack of investigations and arrests of domestic violence cases and more importantly the large and deep level of corruption from the majority of people who surround her. By the end of the movie we see that despite her detailed cases of each victim, the criminals have diplomatic immunity and are simply sent back home. With the large target on her back, Weiszs investigations are all shut down and shes fired; but this does not stop her from releasing all her files publicly to at least give these victims a voice.
As other viewers have warned, at times this is a hard movie to sit through as the content is often times horrific (even just to imagine). If you are able to watch any of the Dragon Tattoo movie collections then Im confident you could watch The Whistleblower. This movie really makes you think and leaves you in awe that such low life corruption could take place, much less in the UN or our government. Of the statistics at the end of the film, I feel the number of trafficked victims around the world (2.5 million) is most likely inaccurate and IMO low. I recommend watching this movie, the acting is good and it exposes the reality and the not so pretty side of life that with enough viewers could potentially change the course of these atrocities.",1384992000,2,2008,4.611731843575419

4890348,5,B005TC5AEA,"This is an excellent film about the deeply disturbing reality of sexual trafficking.  I had seen this film during its original theatrical release three years ago, and in watching it this time, on DVD (which arrived promptly and in perfect, spotless condition), I was again very much moved by this powerful depiction of Kathryn Bolkovac's tremendous and most courageous efforts to rescue women and girls brutally forced and trafficked into prostitution in post-war Bosnia.  In watching ""The Whistleblower"", I was sickened, disgusted, and angered to learn there was international collusion in the trafficking ring she uncovered and exposed to the world.  Although ""The Whistleblower"" is advertised as a dramatization, the scenes depicted in this movie are based on real events and experiences that actually happened, which makes it even more chilling.  This movie contains graphic depictions of real-life violence that actually occurred, so you would have to have a pretty strong stomach in order to watch.  Rachel Weisz is a gifted actress, and her portrayal of Kathryn Bolkovac is powerful, realistic, and inspiring.  This DVD contains a brief interview with Ms. Bolkovac; she was - and is - a courageous example of fighting against injustice and cruelty.",1381104000,2,1255,5.345177664974619

I would highly recommend this film.",1376524800,,322,4.35
4890357,4,B005TC5AEA,"The opening of this flick says it's ""inspired"" by true events so the viewer knows there is a liberal amount of license taken here. certainly this has to be done to make it film fit, but I'd bet the core of this is spot on.

Here's the scoop. Kathryn Bolkovak (Rachel Weisz) is an Arkansas cop who just lost custody of her daughter to her ex. She can't seem to get into higher paying cop work until she hears of a high paying position with the peace keeping forces in Bosnia. She signs on and gets a whiff of human sex trafficking that might involve peace keepers and those way high up in the chain. She starts to investigate and the doo-doo hits the fan.

I liked this a lot. Weisz's character is very human. She's driven in her job (so much so she's blown two marriages) but truly loves her daughter which is why she takes the gig. But she's not a hard case. She needs affection and sex as much as the next girl. The thought of human trafficking is a punch in the guts to her and she, naively, goes after it not even imagining where this could lead. Of course the guys in charge of the girls are total slimeballs. I wanted to dispense with the investigation and just put bullets in their heads. This is so remote from what the average American experiences in their life that it's hard to imagine people being so callous. The investigation has its fits and starts. She makes headway but the deck is stacked against her. The still lovely Vanessa Redgrave is on hand to lend help and a sympathetic ear. David Strathairn plays a key role as well. He's good but his part is rather small as is Monica Bellucci's. She barely exists here. There is a clever sleight of hand in the climax. It might be cheap but I liked it.

This is a story that needs to be told. The statistics at the end are staggering and one hopes this moving up the priority list. It's a steady flick with high production values. If you're at all into this sort of thing this should do you well.",1376092800,,1958,4.272237196765499

Its sobering not only in that its based on true events, but that certain law enforcement organizations we would think trustworthy would be involved in this darkest side of abuse of women. I'll leave it there to keep from spoiling the plot for you - it really is a good film but I rarely cry at films and this one got to me. I'll often watch movies I love more than once, and this was definitely important to see I think but i'll never watch it again.  So, YES I'd recommend it (especially if you're a Rachel Weisz fan as I am), but please use your judgement before letting your kids watch it. It is UGLY, it does not hold back.

It makes me sick to think my tax dollars have funded and continue to fund a corrupt system designed to protect the innocent and instead bring evil and betrayal.  The men responsible should by drawn and quartered with their heads on pikes to rot in the sun.  I wish I knew what I could do to bring these men who are still in high authority to justice.

It is quite disheartening to know how far this corruption goes and just how 'psychopathic' all of this is.  Thomas Sheridan, author of ""Puzzling People, the labyrinth of psychopaths"", has a term 'The psychopathic scum is rising to the top', well look no further for that truth.  This movie is proof.  How horrifically sad for humanity, we should truly be ashamed that the criminal element has become so blatant and 'immune' to being brought to justice.

How can this be if there are supposed 'mostly' good and caring people.

I sure hope there the is an awakening and an 'tipping' point soon so humanity decides as a whole to wake up and 'cut' this vine down before it is too late for all of us.  This 'desert of the real' truly looks like 'hell'.",1373846400,,1071,4.541666666666667

The problems are systemic in the organization and in the private contract companies as we see time and time again. In Iraq towards the end Blackwater was basically deploying borderline criminals and letting them roam around the country performing all kinds of war crimes. They've changed their name more times than I can list though, and they're still working huge contracts.

In this movie you can see how we failed the most vulnerable, people we were meant to protect. And this is hardly the only instance where the UN has been deeply involved in organized crime, profiting from the misery of others.

KB was remarkably brave and Rachel Weizscz (and the rest of the cast) tell the story well.

4890377,5,B005TC5AEA,"This movie is a very impacting film based on true events.  It is based on the story of a Nebraska police officer who becomes a U.N. Peacekeeper stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovinia after the war they had there.  She is originally scheduled for a six month term, but due to an early triumph successfully prosecuting a domestic violence case, she is asked to stay longer in the position of Head of Gender Affairs.  As such, she begins investigating a  human trafficking and prostitution ring.  The eerie part being that the clientele and operators of the ring are not necessarily the local Serbs and Croats, but some of the U.N. Diplomats and ""Peacekeepers"" as well.  With such high ups being involved, some of the U.N. officials try to stymie her investigation.  And she even gets fired.  It turns out the Democra company is based out of England and with some support she's able to collect evidence substantial enough to expose the atrocities to the BBC and file a whistleblower lawsuit.  The movie does an excellent job of bringing out the horrors of the sex trafficking trade and it shows how the impressionable young girls are often hoodwinked into the scheme by their own relatives.  My complaint is that the filmagraphy is very dark, to the point where it is hard to tell who is who at times.

I ask myself, how long can God endure such evil men and allow these girls to suffer.  I pray that justice would flow down from the heavens.

Ultimately, she gets fired for stirring things up and causing trouble.

The Whistleblower is one of those movies that moves you, that talks to your inner conscience and stirs your sense of justice. It makes you want to get up and do something. It makes you feel bad about yourself, that somehow you are complicit in this because you didn't do anything against it. It also gives voice to those voiceless thousands whose lives were shattered because of sex trafficking. It is a movie in which you see the human capacity for both evil and goods, in its extremes. It also made me wonder why I had not heard about this or read about this in the media at all. It is not possible to feel optimistic about the state of the world, about governments or international institutions' capacity for doing good in this world after watching this movie. It makes you think that these institutions are all corrupt, and that the corruption permeates the entire organization. It was mind boggling that some of the very people involved in sex trafficking also had diplomatic immunity or were simply sent home without any criminal investigation. This is not an easy to watch movie - I can't remember how many times I wished the protagonist would just kick the bad guys' asses here; but I also found it very rewarding.

If you are not in the mood to be bothered bothered by unpleasant realities, I suggest you avoid this. Otherwise, I am confident that you will find The Whistleblower to be a rewarding movie experience and 2 hours well-spent. 5 stars.",1354752000,,2088,4.765193370165746

This courageous Lady defied many of the 'higher ups' in the International Peace Keeping process; where she put her life on the line repeatidly to try to save girls and women enslaved in the sex trade in a war zone.

4890405,3,B005TC5AEA,"Alas, I would have been happier with a more action filled version of American lady cop Rachel Weisz tracking down East European  sex traffickers in Bosnia. The character played by Weisz was, alas, one dimensional (that's not her fault ... it's in the screen play).  The movie of an analogous genre, ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" directed and starring Angelina Jolie set the bar very high ... but because it was in both Bosnian and English, with English subtitles who besides me had seen it?

Improbably, the Weisz lady cop roams about the countryside surrounding post-war Sarajevo some times alone, and not speaking a word of the local language. Local thugs and killers (not to mention members of a corrupt police force) exploit, torture, and even murder young women sex slaves ... most often ""imported"" from the Ukraine and Russia. Soon enough, Weisz's character is hot on their trail .... and they know it. How can she be so lucky as to not have one of the thugs make her disappear or put a bomb under her jeep ... that she often races around the countryside in with apparent impunity. Weisz's confidante and ally played by David Strathairn, in a sense had a more realistic role as a United Nations bureaucrat trying to help Weisz expose the horror and corruption reaching to the highest levels in the occupying forces and local police.

I don't fault the actors, among my favorites, for how the story unfolds. But I do fault the screen writer(s) and director for releasing an unrealistic account of what was in fact a true story of an American lady cop who tried to bring humanity and order to a region of the world where both insiders and outsiders profit from human misery and violence.",1349308800,,1694,4.674496644295302
4890406,4,B005TC5AEA,"Rachel Weisz stars as Kathryn Bolkovac, a Lincoln Nebraska police officer. This is not the savvy Rachel Weisz role we are used to seeing. The beginning of the film tries to dummy down her character. Needing money she accepts a job in Bosnia as an observer, quickly moving up to a position of authority. She uncovers a sex trade scandal which involves the local police as well as her fellow co-workers and several international agencies.

Attempting to do the right thing is a challenge especially when the victims fear to cooperate.

This is not an exploitation film as the topic might suggest. There are no horrific graphic scenes and the nudity is on Polaroid photos. The script did not build the suspense, drama and excitement as one might expect. The actors were not as convincing as they should have been. Worth a view, but not owning.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity.",1349049600,,878,4.801324503311259
4890407,3,B005TC5AEA,"Rachel Weisz has become one of my favorite actresses these days with a smattering of terrific performances.  She doesn't disappoint here playing Kathy Bolkovac a real life Nebraska police officer.  Her personal life has been complicated by a recent divorce.  She has a teenage daughter but her ex has been given custody.  He lives in Georgia.  We don't get any back-story on why this unlikely arrangement was granted but the movie is based on real events.  Unable to get a transfer to be closer to her daughter, Bolkovac signs on for a 6 month gig in Bosnia as part of the police keeping force following the Bosnian civil war that ended in the mid-1990's.

When she arrives, she discovers that teenage girls are being used as sex slaves and trafficked to various bidders.  What is even more shocking is that the trade is supported by local police, UN peacekeepers including Americans and others.  While gathering evidence, Bolkovac is stymied by her superiors and is ultimately removed from the force.  This is a depressing and morally repugnant film involving brutal rapes and the revolting behavior of men charged with rebuilding the nation.  As an attractive lone wolf, Bolkovac's own safety is often exposed.

Unfortunately the events lead to an eventual exposure of the criminal activity but few, if any of the key players were ever brought to justice.  An underlying theme revolves around the fact that most of the American's were private contractors, immune from prosecution.  Director Larysa Kondracki's film is far from perfect.  It seems to move along in herky jerky fashion.  Supporting actors Vanessa Redgrave and David Strathhairn add some heft but make no mistake, this is Rachel Weisz's film.

The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The film is purposefully dark and grim as is the color palet, or lack of.  The picture is clear but with expected grain.  In some of the darkest scenes, detail is iffy but I suspect this was intended.  Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack is pretty straight forward with most of the dialog centered movie up front.  Surrounds are used mostly for background chatter and noisy scenes.  In one case I did have to raise the volume to understand a character who spoke in a strong Serbian accent.  Overall, both sound and picture are very good.",1348185600,,2320,4.88974358974359

4890409,5,B005TC5AEA,"Kathryn Bolkovac (Rachael Weisz) is having problems finding a new job. She works on the police department in Lincoln Nebraska and she wants to relocate to Georgia to be near her daughter. She is divorced twice and her ex-husband is taking the daughter with him when he moves because he has parental custody of her. Kathryn can't find a job in law enforcement in Georgia and doesn't have the money to just move and spend time looking for work. Her present boss recommends to her to join the United Nations Peace Keeping Force in Bosnia and make over $100,000, tax free, for 6 months' worth of work. She takes the job to earn money for her relocation.

She is thrown into a world that she doesn't recognize where racial, religious and ethnic hatred is rampant. Women are treated like second class citizens and she soon finds much worse. She finds a thriving human slavery trade for young girls and women who are treated like dogs and sold as sex toys to men for large sums of money. Worse than that the police are totally corrupt and the UN Peace Keeping Force is involved by taking bribes , helping transport women across the border and participating in the torture of the captured hostages.....

The movie is based on a true story and it is worth watching. It definitely is graphic and shocking so be warned. You will be shocked and frustrated as the storyline tells how the UN officers are one of the main reasons that the girls are brought into slavery in the area and that they have immunity for any criminal activity that they are involved in.

Kathryn's bravery and determination not to give up until the story is brought to light is amazing. The men involved play rough and use every method to intimidate her like they have their captive slaves. It is a horrific story that will make you mad as the people empowered to protect the civilians are the worst part of the problem after the war. Everyone from the top down lies and tries to cover up the horrendous things done by the UN Peace Keepers. (Americans included)

4890411,5,B005TC5AEA,"The UN, ILO, WTO, IFOR, etc. all these so-called ""international bodies"" are nothing but organized criminal syndicates created and directed by filthy politicians and dirty businessmen. Ever wondered why nothing ever gets done or no humanitarian funds get distributed properly when funds flow through their pipelines?

The next time you read or hear of yet another time-wasting UN Conference that leads nowhere, know that these occasions are nothing but organized whoring parties that go behind all those flashy smiles and CNN cameras. In the end, nothing ever gets done in the world and taxpayers money is wasted yet again, in shoring up luxurious, dirty, hidden lives. The CNN and BBC won't tell you all that!

This captivating movie peels off the facade of those so-called ""UN peace-keepers"", who are nothing but a mad bunch rapists, murderers and criminals. Then again, most men of the uniform are! That's why these men like to hide behind badges, guns and uniforms!

I pity the female victims of the war. In the absence of justice, they would best CURSE their attackers. In situations such as the ones portrayed in this movie, DEATH CURSES s pronounced by these victims of crime will unite both the Forces of Heaven and Hell to work as One to find and drag those criminals to Hell. No amount of fancy diplomatic immunity, badges, guns and uniforms will be able to protect these criminals then - no matter where these criminals hide in the world! There is no time, space or distance when one seeks justice through the Spirit World! In rare situations of death and victimization of innocents, the aggrieved parties will be heard in both the Halls of Heaven and that of Hell, whosoever the victims and/or their families wish to appeal to! In cases such as these, the devil will once again play the two-timing servant, a Hand of the Almighty and send forth his troops to attack those evil humans - will glee, and with God's directives! Read the Book of Job. As much as he is man's Adversary, Satan  ultimately works under the supreme command and Will of the Almighty.

(I was told of a case in near my area where a female victim who was raped and murdered came back from the dead and exacted justice by killing those who raped her in the same manner of how she herself died. This was a mysterious case that gave the local investigating cops the creeps!)

Rachel Weisz is a great actress and ought to be given an Oscar award for this movie! The message sure got through alright!

The acting is exceptional and the movie successful maintains a steady pace of suspense and drama, with moments of extreme intensity involving the abuse of women (the images are not very graphic but they are still quite disturbing).

However, I do have a gripe with the movie: it portrays women as weak and not very clever. In particular,

(not clever) the main character Kathryn repeatedly jeopardizes her investigation by carelessly tipping off the bad guys, from confronting the whole group at lunch near the beginning of her investigation to emailing the director her accusations without first securing or copying the evidence. She literally found a treasure-trove of irrefutable evidence (pictures, videos, documents) of her coworkers' participation, and yet she stores the evidence in the place where they all work without copying this evidence and sending it to her superiors or the media.

(weak) Kathryn's female boss provides encouragement but absolutely no help throughout the movie, seeming especially weak despite her position of power. Her other female superior repeatedly gives up efforts to help the victims because of bureaucratic red tape. Similarly, the only other female UN peacekeeper refuses to lend Kathryn her key to the building, whimpering ""I'm not like you"". The victims never once resist their attackers (although this makes sense -- their attackers have guns). Ultimately, Kathryn is the only female character in the movie with even a hint of strength.",1332892800,,1632,5.3671875
4890425,3,B005TC5AEA,"I've never been a big fan of message movies. It seems far too often the message gets lost in the whims of the director or actor involved and the real story is buried. But occasionally a movie comes along where the story being told, the facts beneath it all, are so strong that they ease their way into you brain and ferment there, taking hold and forcing you to witness what it was all about. THE WHISTLEBLOWER is one such movie.

It's 1999 and Rachel Weisz stars as Kathryn Bolkovac, a police woman with problems. Her ex-husband has sued for and won full custody of their daughter and is moving her to Georgia. Kathryn requested a transfer to the Georgia State Police but they don't have any openings at the moment and with a mortgage to worry about she can't just up and move. Then fate steps in and provides her with a chance to make great money for just 6 months work. That job is as a privately run security force connected to the United Nations forces working in Bosnia.

Kathryn takes the job thinking she'll just be doing regular police work in another country, helping folks in need and having her back watched by fellow officers. Her first taste of controversy arrives when she comes to the aid of a Muslim woman constantly beaten by her husband. The local police could care less since she's a Muslim. Through her knowledge of law and the with the help of a sympathetic officer, Kathryn gets justice for the woman, a first concerning Muslim women in the area. This comes to the notice of others at the United Nations.

Kathryn is offered a chance to work in the Human Rights commission and jumps at the chance. During one of her investigations she learns of a group of young girls who have been severely abused to the point of torture. In talking to them they lead her to investigate a local bar where she finds pictures of the girls being sexually and physically abused in the worst conditions possible. A room with dirty mattresses and chains to hold the girls is found with used condoms and needles strewn around. In checking the pictures she finds Kathryn discovers that various members of the private contractor peace force she joined are a part of this group as are members of the local police.

Kathryn takes this news to her supervisor and is asked to pursue the matter. She talks one of two girls into testifying about the abuse and the men who were involved. Called away, her ally in the force takes the girl to testify only to be ambushed and have her taken from him. Returned to the hole she was removed from, the young girl is tortured in front of the rest on hand as a way of showing them what will happen if they talk.

Kathryn continues to search for the young girl in hopes of finding her and honoring her promise to keep her safe. Seeing the girl's mother who arrived before she was taken only causes Kathryn more pain. With no one to help her, with all those around her viewing her as the enemy, she finds aid in the group she's worked for at the UN.  Can she save this young girl in time?

The end of the story in real life had so so results. The employees of the company involved in the story were removed from the area but not tried in court. An investigation into human trafficking was begun and the depth of the problem was unimaginable. But the costs involved were high. The career of Kathryn Bolkovac was ruined. The problem though slowed remains.

The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't pull punches. It wants you, the viewer, to realize just how bad the situation is. It wants you to see just how hopeless the lives of these girls become. And it wants you to know that there are people in this world possessed of an evil so overpowering that human life means nothing to them. In a world where we consider the disruption of cable in the middle of a game to be horrific, its hard to imagine a world like that depicted here. But perhaps with movies like this more people will be made aware.

Weisz does a tremendous job here pulling out both the naive ness of her character at first and then the realization that she may have taken on more than she could handle. The feeling of being helpless in a foreign land, of not knowing who you can trust, is on full display in her performance and she does it with ease. You will believe she is Kathryn Bolkovac. And you will realize that this problem is not one that will go away easily.",1332806400,26,4376,4.399258343634116

4890431,1,B005TC5AEA,"This movie is a good example of a bad exploitation film. The graphical depictions of violence were totally unnecessary. Great movie makers have learned that it is usually best to show less so that audiences will think more while amateur hacks leave nothing to the imagination of their viewers except the occasional need to imaginatively find something close at hand to use as a barf bag. All of these disgustingly repulsive scenes of physical torture and emotional abuse were included only to shock and nauseate us not to educate or enlighten us especially since they weren't condensed scenes but rather appeared to be intentionally prolonged as though to extend the sadistic torturing of the audience.

Some people might try and justify the inclusion of these grotesquely distasteful scenes by claiming that people need to see what is really going on in order to change things. I heartily disagree. Do I need to see a snuff film to know that murdering another human being is morally wrong? No. And if I did want to watch the lingering shadow of death stripping bodies of all signs of life, all I need to do is watch CNN's coverage of the atrocities going on in Syria (today is 3-12-12) where some homicidal maniac continues to ruthlessly slaughter innocent men, women and children who are the very citizens he has a sacred obligation as their leader to safeguard and protect! And this systematic destruction of blameless victims of mass homicide goes on day after day while the entire impotent world (including the impotent United Nations) stands by blindly twiddling their bureaucratic thumbs and counting up the murder-stained mountains of tear-stained corpses!

Didn't we learn anything from Auschwitz-Birkenau, Belzec, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor, and Treblinka where the incarnation of evil was allowed to thrive until it reached the magnitude that it did or will we construct a memorial one day for the Syrian death camps that were built while the world watched in silence and did nothing?!

What started out as a review for this movie wound up being a review of something else. I haven't forgotten the victims of sex slavery that this movie reminded me about (even though I don't approve of the tactics they used to get their point across). And if I was Rambo, I know what I would do about it.

But I'm not Rambo.",1331510400,13,2320,4.895674300254453
4890432,5,B005TC5AEA,"""The Whistleblower"" is one of those powerful movies that haunts the viewer long after the film has ended. It is also one of those movies that deals with a horrifying subject and not one I'm likely to watch again, if only because of the nature of the subject and the way it is portrayed in the movie. This is a movie that is based on actual events.

Rachel Weisz delivers a commanding performance as Kathryn Bolkovac, a Nebraska cop who takes up a job offer serving as a UN peacekeeper in post-war Bosnia. Kathryn is initially torn about her assignment because it means leaving her young daughter who lives with Kathryn's ex-husband. When she gets to Bosnia, she finds herself becoming gradually enmeshed in a sordid case, involving rampant corruption and cover-ups dealing with the trafficking of young girls in the underground sex trade. She tries to help two young trafficked victims who have managed to escape, but keeping them safe until they can testify proves almost impossible. Kathryn finds herself among the minority in trying to help these girls, as corruption is rampant and even the people at the highest levels refuse to take her allegations seriously.

There are some terribly violent scenes in this movie that is not for the faint of heart, involving the torture of young victims and also suggestive pictures alluding to indiscriminate abuse. These scenes were not gratuitous but relevant to portray the actual horrors suffered by these young innocents at the hands of their abusers, and attested to by the real-life experiences of these girls as recorded in their interviews (Bolkovac had managed to retrieve the files).

SPOILER ALERT
This is not a movie with a happy ending. It aims to expose and it does so credibly - that an organization that is highly respected such as the UN should cover up criminal activities perpetrated by some of its employees and independent contractors operating under its auspices is troubling and revolting. Justice is not really served in the end. The innocents suffer in silence, and none come to their aid. Kathryn tried and failed, but her courage has given her the strength to expose this crime and the people behind it. She is a true hero.

4890433,4,B005TC5AEA,"I think the low number of reviews here reflects on the nature of the film.  It's hard-hitting, grim, and pessimistic.  Some critics have complained that it gets bogged down in its pessimism, and offers too predictable a picture of evil corporatists exploiting a degraded country.

But I, for one, appreciated the low key nature of the film, and even the purposely, largely affectless performance of Rachel Weisz.  It is easy to contrast this movie with big-budget thrillers like ""Taken"" with Liam Neeson, and ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" with Rooney Mara.  In those two examples, corruption is vanquished by unbelievable, one-dimensional heroes endowed with superhuman abilities.

In ""The Whistleblower"", Rachel Weisz's character isn't a vehicle for moviegoers to vicariously enjoy punishing the baddies.  Her character is unglamorous, human, and restrained. ( What a relief to see a character that doesn't metamorphize into a fire-breathing, kick-boxing avenger.)  She merely observes, and tries to act within the limits of what is humanly possible.

Some people may also be frustrated that the good angels of the movie (David Strathairn and Vanessa Redgrave) flicker in and out, and offer limited encouragement.  The guys at the top of the ""bad guy"" ladder are, of course, too powerful to challenge and the epitome of intelligent evil. They, too, are given very limited screen-time and remain mysterious.  Here again, I thought the movie's restraint was effective.  There are no bombastic showdowns, and the nature of the web of evil that controls the trafficking operation is never fully revealed.  The movie does not attempt to be omniscient, but provides the partial understanding that is natural to the human condition.  Again, realistic.  However, the movie's failing may be the one-dimensionality of the bad guys, who seem to inhabit a cult of inhumanity that even goes beyond fascism.

Still, I liked it and will watch it again.",1331164800,2,1938,5.263843648208469

The starting scenes of a bar and pinball playing immediately alerted me to formula writing. From the movie portrayal of her behavior, language, thought processes and wavering strength of character it was hard to believe this person was ever in law enforcement. Then there was the 99% of the UN, military and security males all conspiring to, covering up or ignorant of female sex trafficking. Even the ending Dyncorp trial, which should have been the most researched and discussed by the writers and director, felt quickly rushed in as an after thought.

No one questions the scope of the problem but a few brief scenes of a few girls in a room with a soiled mattress and a pan for peeing and one girl shot didn't do justice to the immensity of the subject.

4890450,4,B005TC5AEA,"I've been a fan of Rachel Weicz since The Mummy films so when I saw the cover of the blu-ray box I decided to check it out.  I only vaguely remembered this film playing in theaters so I had little to go on.  The cover features Rachel in the leather jacket she wears throughout most of the film and she is holding what appears to be a pistol.  However if you are expecting Rachel as Dirty Harriet, you will be sadly disappointed.  I don't think there is one scene in the film where she is actually  holding the gun on the cover.  As a matter of fact, the film really has no action at all.
Rachel stars as Karen Bolkovic, a Nebraska police officer with money problems.  So she becomes part of a UN sponsored international police force stationed in Bosnia.  It is there that she discovers the sad fact of white slavery and human trafficking in girls for prostitution.  Furthermore she learns that the UN powers-that-be are well-aware of it and some of her fellow policemen are actually involved and profiting from it themselves.  The girls trapped in this horrible life are raped constantly and the film does not shy away from some difficult scenes.  The suspense in the film builds gradually until she is fired from her job and must obtain and smuggle out files indicating her superiors' knowledge of what has been going on.  The film comes to an abrupt but positive conclusion.
Weicz is great as usual (and looks good no matter what role she is playing.) Vanessa Redgrave plays a UN official sympathetic to Rachel's plight.  (At one point in the film, she states the UN was created to prevent another Auschwitz.  I thought this was amusing coming from the actress who blasted the ""Zionist Hoodlums"" at the Academy Award Show of 1976.)  David Straihern plays one of the few fellow cops Rachel can trust and Monica Bellucci looks great in her couple scenes as another UN official.
It seemed to me that there was much cut out of this film, but we will never know since there are no deleted scenes.  The editing seemed a bit confusing at times.  The only special feature was a short segment on the real Karen Bolkovic who, needless to say, looks nothing like Rachel Weicz.
This film is hard to take at times but is recommended if you want to be aware of a shocking and disgusting activity that is still thriving in parts of the world.",1327968000,2,2329,4.520286396181384

4890452,4,B005TC5AEA,"""The Whistleblower"" is a 2010 film that tells the story of Kathryn Bolkovac, a police woman from Nebraska who worked as a part of the 2100 member UN International Police Force in Bosnia in the 1990s. In 2001 Bolkovac was fired for reporting her fellow officers for their involvement in sex crimes and prostitution rackets, and she subsequently sued for wrongful termination and won. She co-authored a book about her experiences, and that book is the basis of this film.

The film stars Rachel Weisz as Bolkovac with Vanessa Redgrave and David Strathairn as her allies.

Weisz (1970) is the British born actress who won an Oscar for ""The Constant Gardener"" (2005) but is probably better known for her ""Mummy"" films with Brendan Fraser. She does a fine job in projecting her vulnerability beneath the determination to do the right thing.

Vanessa Redgrave (1937) puts in her usual good performance. Redgrave was nominated for an Oscar 6 times and won for ""Julia"" (1977). In addition she has 5 Emmy nominations and 2 wins.

David Strathairn (1949) puts in another convincing performance. He was nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA for his phenomenal performance as Edward R Murrow in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" (2005).

First time director Larysa Kondracki spent two years in Europe research sex trafficking in Eastern Europe along with the film's co-writer Ellis Kirwan. Unfortunately the film's pacing is not up to its acting, although she does manage to build suspense in several scenes.

The film won several film festival awards. Roger Ebert called it a ""relentless and frightening thriller"" and Rex Reed said ""Rachel Weisz delivers a powerhouse performance in the true-story conspiracy thriller."" But the Hollywood Reporter noted ""What's missing is a quickening pace and a heightening tension.""

The subject matter is certainly important, especially when you consider that the company at the core of the scandal, Dyn Corp, is still functioning and receives more than 96% of its $3 billion revenues from the US government. But as a film, it could benefit from more crisp direction.

4890453,5,B005TC5AEA,"Certainly the issue of sex slavery, human trafficking, and enforced prostitution has been raised before in film.  Nevertheless, I select ""this story"" as the most harrowing of them all. Ironically, it is persuasive by not being overly graphic.  But the discovery of the crime and the efforts of a lone crusader - a moral police woman  - to try to stop this in Bosnia and protect the girls is truly gut wrenching.  What sticks in my mind is how much corruption exists in all levels of local, foreign, and U.N. agencies.

This is not just a worthwhile movie, it is a necessary one. Unlike a few other reviewers, I did not find the pace slow; the scriptwriter took time to set the stage and let the facts flow naturally - making the movie an astonishingly tense thriller.  I have the highest regard for Rachel Weisz's performance - one of her best. Indeed all the performances are realistic and top notch.

How important is this film?  Consider that in Argentina...human trafficking was legal...until one mother fought the police, the legal system, and the country to change the laws while still looking for her daughter - who may still be alive but working in misery as a forced prostitute. Everything about this movie rings true to me.  Consider also that sex slavery is the second biggest illegal business in the world - yielding billions of dollars in profits every year at the expense of others' dignity.

I never felt that the director was exploiting the subject matter to show either sex or violence.  Instead the director focuses on the fear in the victims' eyes and body language when they are given the choice to testify against their aggressors...or not.

Some of her final scenes in the film are Oscar-worthy and underscore a number of sickening truths that have been developed throughout the script.

From the first few minutes, it's pretty clear that the story isn't going to have a happy ending and once you see what military contractors and UN officials were conspiring to achieve, it's enough to make you want to write letters to your elected representatives. I haven't read anything to indicate that the situation shown in this film is untrue and it paints an extremely shameful picture of what Westerns organizations were doing while supposedly protecting civilians.

4890458,5,B005TC5AEA,"THE WHISTLEBLOWER is a film that kicks you in the stomach and then continues to play out the worst possible truths that we'd rather not admit exist.  The theme of the film is Human Trafficking, and apparently there are about 2.5 million victims around the world today  - young people who are sold into sexual slavery for the financial gain of people from all areas of life, including our own government, the International Practices Task Force, and contracted companies supported by the US Government to rebuild who are  assigned to third world countries and countries besieged by or recovering from war, and in our own cities in this country. This film is based on a true story, a story written (and discussed in the bonus track on the DVD) by Kathryn Bolkovac who was transferred from her police job in Lincoln, Nebraska to Bosnia (with the promise of $100,000. and a six month term) to monitor the local Sarajevo police and advise them on proper police procedures. Bolkovac's story was written for the screen by Eilis Kirwan and director Larysa Kondracki who also directed the story with stinging reality.

Kathryn Bolkovac (Rachel Weisz) is a recently divorced mother of a young girl who has lost custody of her daughter because of her constant commitment to her job.  When she is offered a lot of money and an advancement if she will go to Bosnia on a special assignment she accepts, feeling that if she ha money she can return home to live close to her young daughter.  When she arrives in Sarajevo she is treated with distance from the colleagues with whom she will be working. Her first accomplishment is bringing to justice the abuse of a Muslim woman who has been constantly a victim of spousal abuse - something not considered a crime until Kathryn proves it in court. She soon discovers that there is a human trafficking problem in Bosnia where young girls are brought into the country, sold as sex slaves to tend to the needs and whims and cruel and often sadistic whims of the IPTF (International Practices Task Force) as well as the US and international soldiers assigned by the UN to cover the recovery of Bosnia.  She visits the bars where the girls are kept, finds evidence of physical violence and abuse in the filth of the atrocious living conditions the girls are subjected to, and begins her attempts to save the girls - particularly Raya (Roxana Condurache) and Luba (Paula Schramm) whom she promises to protect if they will testify about their conditions.  Kathryn seeks solace from a Dutch compatriot boyfriend Jan (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) and takes her case to the UN person in charge (Monica Bellucci)  who is a by-the-rules leader and cannot offer help to Kathryn.  Kathryn is contacted by Madeleine Rees (Vanessa Redgrave), the High Commissioner for Human Rights  who aids her in her plight and puts her in contact with Peter Ward (David Strathairn), in Internal Affairs chief of the UN complex.  Kathryn finally discovers that the perpetrators of the human trafficking are the very people with whom she works and she is ultimately fired from her position. But before she leaves she releases the documents she has created that prove the victims of human trafficking are under the direction and service of the employees of the UN - in many ways her dangerous mission has been accomplished and the Democra, a security contractor, is exposed.

Rachel Weisz brings a very human quality to her role, making her transformation into a heroine for the abused victims all the more credible.  Her performance is outstanding - and in the conversation with the real life Kathryn Bolkovac in the bonus feature with the film the manner in which Weisz succeeded in her role is all the more impressive.  This is a tough movie to watch, but it is a necessary statement to make the heinous crime of human trafficking more widely known and punished throughout the world.  Highly Recommended.

Kathryn Bolkovac (Rachel Weisz), a Nebraska cop, is a divorced mom who takes a job with a security contractor for big pay and a short tour in the Balkans.  She discovers that ethnic tensions have caused local cops to refuse to investigate domestic violence cases, particularly those involving Muslims.  She is promoted and put in charge of gender affairs by a U.N. official (Vanessa Redgrave), but is increasingly frustrated.  After building cases against sexual traffickers, she's told they enjoy diplomatic immunity.

Bolkovac is a lone crusader, persuading fearful women to testify against their abusers, bucking diplomatic hypocrisy, and dealing with rampant paranoia.  Ms. Weisz heads this topical political thriller, turning in a powerful performance, one of her best.  The movie underscores the collateral damage caused by politics and maintaining the delicate balance of world peace, though it's far more compelling as one strong woman's efforts to advocate for those without a voice.

If they resist in any way, they are tortured in such ways that are unspeakable.  The Bosnian men, on the whole, are crude, brutal, insensitive clods.

Kathy Bolkovac, a Nebraskan Police Officer, goes to Bosnia as a Peacekeeper and is confronted with the horrors of human trafficking which she desperately tries to do something about.  To compound the issue many of her fellow American Peacekeepers are involved in the sex trafficking and are receiving payoffs from the brothels, and are in cahoots with the corrupt police. And the U.N. refuses to do anything to protect these young women.

Ms. Bolkovac is summarily escorted out of Bosnia because of her investigation into the sex trafficking.  However, she does get to eventually report what she has learned to the BBC.  Yet, the sex trafficking still goes on in Bosnia.

This story is based on actual events.  Rachel Weisz as Kathy Bolkovac is outstanding.

I was on the edge of my seat watching the horrific events in this film.",1529712000,,1240,4.852380952380952
8486035,4,B005TC5AEA,"Very good movie. Well acted and good storytelling. However, I wish the synopsis had included the fact that the movie was about a human trafficking ring. I wasn't prepared for that, and my husband isn't a fan of rape scenes in movies. Had a known that, I likely would've passed on watching it when I did.",1529452800,,303,4.428571428571429
8486036,4,B005TC5AEA,"This was a good movie and I'm sure it did not depict the horrors these young women (and perhaps in some cases men) experience and go through. How brave Kathryn Bolkovac was (to try to help these women and to tell this story) under incredible odds. Rachel Weisz did a great job portraying Bolkovac and although her part was a small one, Vanessa Redgrave was awesome. Many of us are comfortable in our lives and for me, to see this movie (I also recently saw Trafficked but it was not as good as The Whistleblower) it's unfortunate that these illegal acts occur world wide. Kudos to Bolkovac and others like her!  Watch the movie......and others that deal with this crime.",1529193600,,670,4.583333333333333

8486039,5,B005TC5AEA,"Incredibly well made movie. Human trafficking is a sick problem that deserves more attention than this movie. The Whistleblower brought human trafficking to the surface with the gripping reality of what happens behind closed doors.
The movie shows trafficking of humans is truly like an iceburg, it barely touches the surface of what is going on all over the world in every state and country. It was a difficult movie to watch because of the sheer reality of the horrific crimes that throw away the lives of children and teens ~ human beings treated like garbage. A while ago I came across an article on the internet that showed human trafficking routes in my own state. There are a number of news reports of human trafficking even in CT. It's shocking. There should be a special taskforce just for these crimes. Makes you want to put chips in your children. Devastating! A must see movie.

Rachel Weisz is excellent, as always.

Movie is for mature audiences.",1528588800,,960,4.77710843373494
