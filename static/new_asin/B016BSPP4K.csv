7466187,4,B016BSPP4K,Sarah Silverman's acting was stellar!!!  The story itself is very real and very sad but all too common in homes across our country.,1447027200,4,131,4.695652173913044
7466188,5,B016BSPP4K,"I smile back is not a big movie. It reminds me of older independent movies like Betty Blue or Polyester in scope and scale. And it is not a happy movie. Its tone is definitely on the darker side.  Not unlike Thelma & Louise, one won't find many likable male characters here. I think the husband was meant to be more sympatheticbut I found him too boring to garner my sympathies.  As for the father and the Bruce Springsteen fan, well, youll just have to see it. I give it five stars for tackling uncomfortable subject matterthus not being chiefly commercially-driven, and for Sarah Silverman. Sarah Silverman is believable, very watchable, and willing to be seen in an unflattering light to further the story.",1447027200,3,709,4.709677419354839

7466190,5,B016BSPP4K,"Only complaint is the movie would have been better as a mini series. Sarah is amazing! Real convincing, but would have been better with more character development!",1446940800,,163,5.074074074074074
7466191,3,B016BSPP4K,"Our introduction to Sarah Silvermans character in Adam Salkys I Smile Back is a harsh one. Shes perched in the bathroom of her home half-naked, snorting cocaine off of the toilet seat as her children and husband play directly outside. We see her prepare a bathtub as she watches them through the window, pondering what has gone wrong. She doesnt dwell though, taking another line through her nose before submerging herself in the water.

Laney Brooks, this suburban housewife dealing with depression and a strong addiction to both alcohol and drugs, is a walking, impending disaster. However, on the surface, it seems that shes keeping things together. Her two children get to school on time every morning, and theres always food on the dinner table when her family arrives home. But what happens during the duration of her day is of interest. She finds herself cheating on her husband with a family friend (another drug addict whos married with kids), fueling her wrongdoing with the vodka and various pills she constantly downs. She tries to suppress the many things that make her unhappy - most of all her absent father - with these substances that allow her to momentarily block the anguish shes suffering from.

Sarah Silvermans terrific performance is painful to watch, yet captivating nonetheless. My issue with the film is not in her, but more her character and where she ends up at the end of all this. We as an audience, like Laney, are put through a lot (and want to see her pull through). But theres no payoff here, and the film ends on quite a dismal note. The movie is as despairing as she is, and leaves the viewer feeling cold. The bleak storytelling at play is much too hard to endure, and Silvermans first dramatic role is the only real thing to take away.",1446940800,13,1774,4.719354838709678

7466193,2,B016BSPP4K,"Sarah Silverman is fantastic and should garner consideration come awards season, but the rest of this movie didn't live up to her brilliant performance.",1446940800,,152,5.375
7466194,3,B016BSPP4K,"If movies were rated on acting alone, I Smile Back (ISB) would unquestionably get 5 stars. Alas, there is something off about the script here. ISB may have been penned with the soccer mom demographic in mind -- and for all I know, it will be a hit with that crowd. Laney Brooks (Sarah Silverman) buzzes around town in a mammoth Darth Vader SUV to meet up with her husband's friend for sex and drugs after dropping the kids off at school. Right off the bat, Laney isn't a character that you'll particularly care about; unfortunately, this doesn't much improve even when we learn that she suffers from some kind of mental illness and is spiraling out of control in part because she stopped taking her prescribed lithium. Laney is an addict, and the screenwriters enjoy clobbering you over the head until you can't forget it (as if the first minute of ISB doesn't tell you all you need to know).

PROs
 A tour de force from Sarah Silverman; this coming from someone who isn't all that familiar with her comedic work.
 At times ISB seemed a bit of a rollercoaster ride, which implies that I cared enough about the protagonist to feel something.
 There's no SHHE here (Standardized Hollywood Happy Ending).
  Inducing a pleasurable cringe, there's a too close for comfort scene where Laney compares marriage to prostitution (the scene involves Emma Ishta, star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stitchers/dp/B00Y1OX0OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stitchers</a>). There are a handful of other memorable moments.

CONs
 The screenwriters have Sarah Silverman on such a tight leash! Wasted potential since Silverman is obviously capable of blowing us away.
 It's not a story of the protagonist's struggle, it's just a catalog of some crappy events in the life of an upper middle class addict.
 Depression can make you say: ""What's the point of it all?"" ...that's also what you may be asking yourself about I Smile Back.",1446854400,3,1954,5.135646687697161

Although this movie was serious and heartbreaking-there was some funny parts to it lol. The ball drying part had me rolling-especially because she kept a straight face the entire time. On a serious note-I think people underestimate what childhood trauma can do to a person. Her non existent relationship with her dad pushed her to lead a double life-the mental disorders she was dealing with didn't make things any better.

7466206,5,B016BSPP4K,"WARNING SPOILERS:
As a man who despised Sarah Silverman's onscreen persona since I first ""met"" her, I was stunned by her acting ability - and beauty - in this film. Wow. Bitch can act! I hope SS reads this and can understand I saw that her performance as junkie, sex addict (slut?), alkie, Jew, narcissist, rich-housewife-with-typical-problems could have easily fallen into any of those ""ruts"". Not so. IMHO she glides above all those potentially distracting clich&eacute;s and personality flaws and just blows it outta the water with this portrayal of a girl, (yes, she didn't grow up completely) whom the viewer just wants to HUG and say ""You're tryin' your best, it'll be okay"", as her screen hubby does so many times. His part was so well-written - except, if he forgave and loved so thoroughly and repeatedly, why the hell would he give up on her after her genuine repeated attempts at redemption?
I have never read (or written) reviews with spoilers, but this picture left me no choice. Brava, SS, you have earned my respect as an actress. Thanks go out to the crew, too; I realize it's not just a one (wo)man-show, and the production was great. Totally believable and immersive - I did not even need to willingly suspend disbelief, haha. I know people like this! Thanks.",1496534400,,1277,4.782805429864253
7466207,5,B016BSPP4K,"Sarah Silverman nails this part.  This realistic portrayal of a young woman battling depression is very well-acted, scripted and directed.  Highly recommend.",1495411200,,157,6.090909090909091
7466208,4,B016BSPP4K,"Sarah Silverman does a very fine job in this film. It is certainly career transforming, but probably not an Oscar level performance. There is a lot of Truth in her portrayal of an upper middle class mother of two young children who is in the throes of addiction, depression and feelings of inadequacy.... l don't think it is accurate to say that she is ""battling"" these problems. The character seems resigned at times that she is somehow doomed. The movie may have been emotionally more effective if she had some hope, even an unrealistic self-deluded hope. All in all, a very good and even powerful movie.

There was a scene in the film where Silverman's character encounters a bartender who says he's from Minneapolis. She asks him: ""Dylan, Prince, or The Replacements?"" More of this kind of smart, aware, ""cool chick"" dialog would have given us some more insight into the character and demonstrated her creeping Suburban numbness.

I would be remiss not to mention that there is an excellent topless scene early in the film. It is not sexual, but it satisfied my curiosity. Sarah Siverman is beautiful woman I have always wondered if we would ever get a Jamie Lee Curtis ""Trading Places"" type scene from her.",1494028800,,1211,4.7894736842105265

7466226,1,B016BSPP4K,"It is difficult to characterize this well acted piece of trash.  The word ""tawdry"" falls far short.  This is a tale without redemption, the falling to ashes of a bitter woman consumed by addiction to her own vice, incapable of loving anything else but her vice.  In it there are no end of excuses, not the least of which is the clich of abandonment by a monochromatically worthless father.  But there is no ""smiling back.""  There is only the dog returning to its vomit, and the sow to its mire, and the burnt fool's bandaged finger wobbling back to the fire.  Still, if you are a masochist in desperate need of degradation, or a psychoanalyst confronted with a particularly vexing case of personality disorder, this might be just the film for you.",1484092800,5,747,4.621212121212121

I had heard a review of the movie, and was interested for a serious look into the life of a person dealing with mental health issues, substance abuse, etc.  I wish there were MORE movies that realistically portrayed these things.  Rather, it was just a snapshot of the havoc wrought in one woman's life and in her marriage by depression and addiction, without any real apparent thought given to explaining the HOW and WHY of her descent.  Sarah Silverman did an admirable job in the role, and was tragically and utterly believable.  Having heard the review ahead of time, I wasn't expecting a happy ending, so that's not the source of the disappointment.  It's just that we were dropped into her life with no knowledge of how she got to where she is, and two hours later, we were plucked out with no closure of any kind, and only a vague hint as to what her life might look like next week, next month, or next year.

7466250,5,B016BSPP4K,"Exceptional acting from Sarah Silverman. This movie really got to me. It's such an open honest portrayal of how it feels when you can't be your honest self with your family because truthfully they don't love your honest self, they only care about the pretend self.

Heartbreaking scenes with the father that I can SO TOTALLY relate to.
The basic question,
""Why didn't you call me?""
And she takes him to the mat,
""No. I mean the Thirty years before that.""
Yeah. It's hard and painful just like that.
And in rehab she tries to talk openly with her husband and he freaking shuts her down by calling the kids over. BAM. We're done. Reality time is over. Time and time again she tries to open up to him. And what does he do? He shuts her down. He doesn't want a wife, he wants a wind up Barbie doll who doesn't complain.

I think, the families of addicts need to watch this movie. They are the ones who won't relate. I felt so badly for the way this movie ended. I desperately wanted Sarah's character to just be loved back. She loved them all so much. Sometimes all a person needs is some real honest love.

Again the blame is always that ""they""-the addict--are the problem, ""they"" need to get the help. It couldn't possibly be the effed up environment and dysfunctional dynamics surrounding them?

 That Donny was a real treat. Such a piece of crap. I hope Sarah gets the Oscar for this. She put herself through a lot to make this movie a stunning piece of lasting film. Timeless and real to the core. Brave On You, Sarah!",1479686400,,1519,4.391459074733096

Surprising in that it's an indie movie that's not overly quirky and ""cute"", and that Sarah Silverman (known primarily as a cute but foul mouthed comic) can really act.  She's quite stunning in this movie.  You forget about Sarah's comic persona because she totally immerses herself in the role.  The rest of the cast is also excellent.  The man who portrays her husband, Josh Charles, stands out in a fine cast.  The film is also pretty bleak and sad, probably because addicts like Sarah's character live pretty bleak and sad lives.  It's essentially the ""well off woman who has everything but is depressed"" story, but it's very well done.  Some of the dialogue is a little dry and plain, but that's a small quip.  Overall, an excellent movie, with a great lead performance by Silverman.",1476489600,,824,4.787234042553192

The story was painfully realistic-ish, as I would imagine addicts might function, The ""daddy issues"" basis was very lean and not believable. There must have been more to the original story due to the severity of the deviant behavior of the main character.  The behavior itself was analogous to observed behavior exhibited by addicts I have had the pleasure to have had in the past.  And Miss Silverman has the right 'cleanish' look of a truly suffering addict, with the straight faced lying being the real challenge.

Too bad there was no end to the story.  I wanted closure, if there really is such a thing for those who care for addicts as partners.",1475971200,,768,4.8320610687022905

It's not the usual overstated mental illness -- this is close to spot-on, if you've ever known a real person with one of the more destructive forms of bipolar/personality disorders.  Usually, in movies, it's so overdramatic and corny.  This was so real; I can't forget it, except it would have been more relatable had the family not been so upper-upper middle class but trying to present itself as middle class.  There are class distinctions in America, unfortunately, and this movie kind of ignores the obvious wealth and high quality health care this woman receives -- although, again, her mental health care doesn't help much.

I felt her pain but did not understand why anyone thought 30 days of therapy was going to help her? I did not see anyone trying to curb her cocaine habit; where did she get it? From her married lover? In the end, I get the impression that no one can help a bipolar addict. It looks like she ran towards trouble just short of being murdered or killing herself.

The movie's just kind of a misery porn. Laney is a mentally ill woman (her illness isn't stated but its hinted at that she has bipolar disorder) who is trying her best to be a good wife and mother, but her illness causes her to seek solice in sex, drugs and alcohol. She's out of control, then she gets better, then she gets out of control again, tries to get better. The film is just kind of flat. You don't get to know the characters well, you don't really feel sympathy or anger at anyone. For a movie that's obviously trying to be really emotional I didn't really feel anything while watching it. The only time I ever had a reaction was at the teddy bear scene. Watch the movie and then you'll get what I mean. That was nasty.

Silverman's performance was honestly better than I expected, but that doesn't make up for the lack of story or bland writing. The little boy who played Eli was also great. That kid definitely has potential. Otherwise I was kind of let down though.",1472256000,,1193,4.345291479820628

It did not. I don't mind if a film's main character is unsympathetic and unlikeable, but it's not interesting for me to watch a privileged, upper middle class, white woman become so self-destructive. I felt the filmmaker missed an opportunity by not presenting more information about the main character's mental illness, which may have been the reason for her unhappiness. Or maybe it was the marriage? Maybe she was schizophrenic? Was she bi-polar? A sex addict? A character study should be more compelling, especially if that character isn't sympathetic and the viewer isn't given insight into what motivates the character's behavior and journey. I do enjoy challenging films, but unfortunately ""I Smile Back"" wasn't a compelling film. It's not very interesting for me to watch a person get high, get high, get high and behave in a self-destructive manner for most of the film.

I can't give it 5 stars because I personally think films, particularly drama, should teach us something and tell a complete story and I Smile Back does not achieve either.

We are so use to laughing at her and she turned us around in the first view minutes. Early on we learn that her character is an out of control train wreck and hauntingly hold our breath wathing the train rage out of control.

I guess I bought this on the strength of Sarah Silverman in the lead role, and enjoying what I've seen of her comedy.  Here she has a completely non-comedic role and that is a totally different experience.  It also gives you a new look at her acting ability.  In the depths of her pain, at times her gaunt-looking face and haunted eyes involuntarily remind me of her Jewish identity, as she looked as if she could have just been released out of a concentration camp.

But shes no concentration camp victim here.  She married an upper-middle-class husband, has a nice house in the suburbs, a new SUV to drive her children around, and a troubled childhood she cannot seem to escape.

Some viewers think shes bipolar because the script mentions that she is prescribed lithium.  But she is not depicted as bipolar.  Rather she appears more like a borderline personality struggling with substance dependence, frequent anger and depression, and compulsive dysfunctional behaviors.

Those who like serious but depressing movies will like this one.  I actually gave up part way through, as I just didn't feel the need for further self-punishment that day.  Definitely a serious work.",1467676800,3,1237,4.913043478260869

The supporting actors were great, but this movie left me very unsatisfied. I don't always need an ending that ties everything up in a neat bow, but what happened here?

Given that bias, I thought her portrayal of the selfish and self-destructive Laney, wife & mother of two was powerful.  Laney moved quickly past sympathetic to merely pathetic. I kept waiting for Sarah to break character and give the camera a snarky, sarcastic, aside.  It never came.  The movie ended with no resolution, no path forward. I don't expect a movie to end with a soft focus shot of a perfect family on a picnic blanket.  But, this film ended with ""Really, Crdit Roll?""",1466294400,,550,4.747368421052632

A few words to describe this movie: harsh, brutal, emotionally raw.  As we see Sarah's character having troubles right out of the gate, I thought this might be another movie wherein the husband can't leave fast enough - you know, where he is either the poor 'neglected husband victim' or he is actually the cause of the wife's problems. Neither here. This movie was intense...an emotional ride that is gut-wrenching, yet I was left wanting to know more. A frank, punch-in-the-face depiction of addiction and mental illness made real because she could be your neighbor.",1465689600,,771,4.796992481203008

It was an accurate grueling portrait of a woman's horrible , ongoing struggle with the legacy she was left and the one she can't help but leave behind in her wake during one period of her life. So real that it hurt to watch but her acting kept me glued to her performance. I don't think she said one true word, and doing so would have really freed her but she wallowed in her demons digging herself in deeper & deeper. Yes she had some serious reasons to have difficulty but she somehow thought it was her fault and her endless punishment that need to occur. Over & Over. Even when it clearly was repeating a cycle and harming others. A strange sort of ego centered view of her life. That was real to her. Her family was not. They weren't really essential to her view of herself. There was no connection with few exceptions. And that was fleeting.  Incredibly SAD. You may need to be in the ""right"" headspace to watch this.

The camera remains stubbornly fixed on her character's decline, no matter what extreme action she takes. The result is a relentless trek toward the inevitable that nevertheless retains narrative intrigue. Like Nurse Jackie, which I also love, without the humor or episodic pacing. We need more films like this that portray real life and believable women. Both are flawed, but worthy of sustained attention. I couldn't look away.

But this movie is not about funny things - it is about addiction, depression and dysfunction.  Her character is a suburban soccer mom who happens to like cocaine and risky sex with other moms'  husbands.  The only sympathetic characters in this story are the kids.  The subject of addiction and depression have been done many times before and the failure of this movie is not do to the acting talent, but to the storyline which is trite and flat.  If you want to see a gritty character study about addiction, find and watch ""Clean and Sober"" with Michael Keaton.  With all that said, I gave this movie three stars instead of two because Sarah does bring something unsaid to the part that resonated with me ever so slightly - she has this hollow, dead-eyed stare that demonstrated that there was nothing going on inside her character because THAT was how damaged her character had become.",1465344000,,996,4.722543352601156

7466793,5,B016BSPP4K,"I have been a fan of Sarah Silverman's comedy, understanding the complexity from where her humor comes from, and so it is no surprise she did so well in a drama. It is interesting film because it does not romanticize or judge the character's behavior, instead the audience is allowed full reign on what they ""see"", so that over all the perception is different for each person and sheds more light on their own biases or the things that make them uncomfortable. All of the character's responses were not only relatable but humanly appropriate to what each person needed. This creates the idea that it is up to us if we hate Elaine or if we root for her. That of course is for people who see things in a very black vs. white manner. In reality I think there is alot more grey area, so there are no real villains only people trying with different methods to cope, and everyone has taken some part in hurting each other through actions or lack of communication/avoidance. Elaine's family is a particularly extreme case going through the eye of the storm, but by the end I believe she understands she doesn't want to hurt her children with her issues and that despite maybe they not understanding and holding a grudge against her they wouldn't even if she stayed, so maybe barring them from trauma in absence like her own father might be the best answer even if it is the unthinkable choice.",1465257600,,1386,4.548

She grew up not knowing her father and somehow felt unworthy of her father's love because he never reached out to her. Now that she is older and wiser, the thoughts of not having a father to validate her existence leads her down the wrong paths--drugs, alcohol, etc.

She makes an attempt to try and reclaim her sense in her tumultuous pasts, but is never really healed.

This is a piece of art, and the filmmakers and Silverman have no obligation to you, the viewer, to be spot-on realistic. They are giving us an impression of these problems. Unfortunately, as art this film fails.

Basically, it's one clich after another. A pretty white woman who seemingly has everything in life can't deal with her abandonment issues and tries every dysfunctional behavior to erase her pain. Yawn.

What's most unforgivable, however, is the ending. *Spoiler alert* Following her worst bender yet, Silverman comes home, sees the disgust in her husband's eyes, and the walks out. Roll credits.

The filmmakers ask us to invest time getting to know these characters, but then literally close the door on US at the most important point in the movie. What??? I initially thought the Amazon player somehow skipped ahead to the credits.

But no. It's just actors and filmmakers who care more about gazing at their own navels than telling a great story.",1464134400,,1199,4.915841584158416

Sarah Silverman does an amazing job of acting in this movie.  If you expected her to be funny, well it isn't - this is a drama - and a very well acted intense disturbing drama which portrays an addict whose life has been spiraling out of control for some time.  There is some glimmer of hope for a while but that quickly fades away.  It is very sad.  It is sad that the people in her life seem to contribute to her sickness more than they are really helping.  It was like her husband was totally clueless.  Her visit with her father proved to be a huge mistake as everything began to fall apart badly after that.  In my mind she deserves an Oscar nomination for this movie.  It was just a hard movie for me to watch - it wasn't easy for me to watch this movie.  I wouldn't call it enjoyable.

7467063,4,B016BSPP4K,"An important movie. Excellent acting. So much of the review commentary on here is about addiction per se... But I saw the drugs and drinking as a minor issue because I've spent a lot of time around ""bi-polar types"" both in social service treatment settings and in ordinary life settings. Many of them exhibited Elaine-type behaviors over and over yet never drank or did drugs at all. I thought her father's revelations were very telling because he was close enough to Elaine's mother to understand deeply that she had crossed-wires in her brain (of course a crude layman's expression but nonetheless useful)... and he was also close enough to Elaine as a child to assess that she had the same genetic disposition. It was all too much for him to deal with, so he opted out, eventually to form a new family with different genes. Can't blame him. The evolution of the soul as it reincarnates into successive bodies and passes through various levels of experience is a fascinating topic. Some people can be helped a lot, some a little, and some hardly at all. I don't know about you, but I've often had to disengage from people to let their various karmas take their various courses...

At times the movie bordered on a fine edge of shocking/depressing. But I think that was the intent of the filmmaker. Some scenes are very graphic and adult in nature. Without giving any spoilers, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. Much like real life, no real resolution to life's problems.

Silverman shows actual acting ability, creating depth of character.

7467277,2,B016BSPP4K,"I liked seeing Sarah Silverman stretch into a dramatic role. I did think the film was a bit uneven regarding the cause and effect of her personal demise. The dialogue refers to her having problems in the past, talks about her going off her medication. Not much more detail after that. Did not really go into depth as to the issues with her father. Where is the anger? Displaced onto her family unfortunately. At the end she simply walks out of the door of the family home as her husband silently watches. Has he had enough? Has he given up on her? Where is she going? We can only guess what is going to happen to her and it probably will not be pretty. I though the kids were really good though.

Imagining as well as experiencing bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a mental illness characterized by periods of depression and periods of elevated mood, is one way of describing this movie. An elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy or irritable.

7467488,4,B016BSPP4K,"Why is it that women seem to suffer from this nothingness, nihilism? They seem to be told by society that their feelings are so extraordinary that they can't function as normal people. She has people around her, school matron, parking attendant, who are simply not nice. She let's it affect her. It doesn't have to. It doesn't have to turn her world upside down. Women let these slights affect them. They can't conform to normal society, be normal parents, etc. Men seem to be able to function well, even though their relationships are messed up. That is, they can function at work, or hide their feelings. Women can't do this as well, because their maternal instinct tells them they are different than men. If women are relationally off kilter, their lives are all topsy turvy. It's an interesting movie. But it's also sexist. She wants to act irresponsible like her father was with her. But women are supposed to be more responsible with their feelings, with their family than men are. She's not. So she takes it out on her family. It's an interesting study in women. But it's not very pretty. Of course, the script was written by women. How can a woman screw up her life without really trying?",1463270400,,1196,4.672985781990521
7467489,2,B016BSPP4K,"It seems like *good* and I stress 'good' comedians do very well in dramatic roles because I think comedy and drama are very deeply linked.  So even though I don't care about the subject matter, I gave this a chance because I thought there had to be something very redeeming in the script or with the character for Sarah Silverman to choose this film as her first venture into drama.  Imho, there's little to redeem this film, but I do have a semi serious theory as to why Sarah Silverman chose this role, which I'll share at the end.  Assuming of course I get published.  This is my third attempt.

The main thing I didn't care for was the nihilistic tone.  You knew right away there would be no happy ending.  So if you like existentialism (ie a philosophical and literary movement whose leaders all crawled up their own a-ses and died), the bleak tone may not bother you.  Some reviewers are trying to use this film as a 'teachable moment' about mental illness/addiction.  Imo, there's not much to learn here.  I ain't no expert in the mental health fields and I have no desire to drop my pants and measure the inches after my name like some people seem to be doing.  But I'll save you some time here.. some people can't be helped.  They won't take their lithium, they don't want or don't feel like they deserve to get better, and they don't seem to care how their behavior effects everyone around them.  It's a fact that with help 2/3 of all crazy people get better.  And without help, 2/3 of all crazy people get better.  I learned that interesting fact in an abnormal psych class I took.  Look, if you're at all aware of mental illness and/or addiction, you know this and you don't need to see it play out.  I honestly don't see the purpose behind making this film.  It'd be like making a movie about Alzheimers, but making it so bleak that instead of feeling sorry for the old people, you just feel like putting everyone over 70 in hospice- whether they have dementia or not!

Here's my theory about why Sarah Silverman chose this script.  She really, really wanted to show her uh, let me say body parts 'cuz the censors will hold up my review again, and she wanted to have intercourse in a nontraditional uh, let me say orifice and she wanted to uh, let me say jill off with a teddy bear-- my other phrasing was much better.  But she wanted to do those things in such a way that no guy could possibly be turned on by it.  Well, joke's on you, Sarah!  I was.  Big time!  But if you're not a sicko just watch from the 3:46 mark to the 4:05 and then bail on the film.  Spoiler-- They ain't floppin' around or nothing, but they're there.  Just sorta hanging.  Lifeless and unloved.  And lookin' a little too unspoiled for a woman  who supposibly had kids if ya ask me.",1463270400,,2771,4.365949119373777

7467537,1,B016BSPP4K,"CONTAINS  SPOILERS .......

Sarah Silverman is a married woman with two small children.  She is supposed to be taking Lithium, but she doesn't, and instead, she gets drunk, takes uppers and downers, smokes marijuana and does cocaine, has anal sex with the husband of a pregnant friend, masturbates with her child's teddy bear, and embarrasses her husband at parties.

There is no happy ending (and there was no happy beginning or middle either).  The ending is horrible.  Sarah has just been released from rehab, and she is supposed to go to a business event with her husband.  She does not show up for the event and embarrasses her husband.  She goes to a bar and gets drunk and high and then has sex with a stranger in the bar who beats her up.  She goes home and her husband sees her beaten face and has a pretty good idea where she has been, and they just look at each other blankly and do not speak and she walks out.  The end.",1463184000,3,932,4.39766081871345

She's also drinking heavily, snorting cocaine, taking addictive prescription drugs, and even maturbated with her little girl's teddy bear while she slept in her bed. She goes for treatment but soon relapses back to her addictions. She goes to bars and flirts as though she easily and perversely forgot her loving family.

The issue I have with this movie is that, as a person suffering from depression and CPTSD, struggling on a very low income with little assistance and no family, it's difficult for me to feel bad for a woman who has two amazing kids, Josh Charles as a husband, and a beautiful home in a nice neighborhood. I wanted to tell her to go ahead and go away and I'll take her life! I would trade her on a heartbeat. I get that one can't control their depression and often can't see how good things are, but I think my personal financial issues cause a great deal of that stress for me, and with them gone-Laney has no financial issues!- I'd be far less stressed or depressed.",1463011200,,713,4.211678832116788

Generally known for her comedic skills, her range, power, and intensity were both surprising and, simply put, astounding.
Based on this powerful performance, there is no doubt, that Silverman will be sought out for future dramatic roles, and with the right vehicle, the sky's the limit for this surprisingly talented actress.

7467876,5,B016BSPP4K,Sarah Silverman is a very powerful actress. You get a little spark of her humor during some of the emotional scenes.

Sarah Silverman was absolutely brilliant and I quite frankly had no idea she was such an amazing actress. I could not stop thinking about this movie and it literally kept me up half the night. I highly, highly recommend it--just don't watch it just before going to bed.

Also, to the reviewers who are giving this movie one star because it's too dark and depressing...life is not all flowers, rainbows and candy. If you don't want to see the darkness a lot of people have to face when dealing with addiction, then don't watch the movie.

She knows  the damage she is doing to herself and her family; yet, she cannot not fully overcome her addictions. Sarah Silverman can sometimes be a controversial personality. She proves in this movie that she is a serious actress. The viewer wonders how such a beautiful woman who seems to have it all can allow herself to lose it all. It is also a serious look at mental illness. If you are looking for a happy-ever-after ending, this is not your film.

What Silverman does best is mediate her natural wit with the character she plays. The screenplay is also quite well done, and some of the children's lines are the most deeply cutting.
Josh Charles, who plays her husband, is almost typecast as the worst kind of person, and part of that shines through here. It's difficult to feel sorry for him, and the attempts in the film to sympathize with him are rarely successful.

7467961,3,B016BSPP4K,"Someone said in an earlier review that this was an accurate portrayal of bipolar disorder. I grew up with a bipolar parent, and this looks nothing like the bipolar behavior that I witnessed. There is no evidence in the film of manic swings alternating with depressed phases. To me, the film is about drug abuse as a way of coping with emotional baggage leftover from childhood. The only thing that ties it to bipolar is the suggestion that she has stopped taking her meds, and a reference to lithium. If you are looking to understand bipolar disorder, I don't see this film as an accurate portrayal at all. What made me feel the saddest was her lack of self-esteem and the way she allowed herself to be used sexually. While promiscuity can be a symptom of bipolar disorder, it just didn't come across as a part of mental illness here.

The one scene where she enters various bedrooms in her house after a bender, was particularly raw and well done.

I'd ideally give it 3.5 stars. While I feel it was well done and realistic in general... I feel there were some holes in the plot and it felt a bit rushed.

7468096,4,B016BSPP4K,"Spoilers, sort o.

A good movie about addictions downward spiral of a person, that while not filthy rich is definitely upper middle class and living a lifestyle most would find enviable.

Sarah Silverman gives a nuanced performance that appropriately ranges from subtle to desperate and self destructive.  The only weak part of the movie for me was the husband played by Josh Charles.  Not that Josh Charles did a bad job; its just that his character could have stood a little more fleshing out.  I suspect some of his performance was edited out before the final cut.

Im disappointed by some of the one star reviews here not because those people didn't like it, but rather because the prevailing rational is that the story is too bleak.

First of all Ive seen much bleaker depictions of drug abuse such as Requiem for a Dream but thats beside the point.  How did we get to this place in America where every movie has to have an uplifting message and happy ending?

Drug addiction doesnt always have a happy ending and the deliberately ambiguous ending in a way mirrors the real lives of addicts and their love ones who live from one moment to the next not knowing whats going to happen.

Without bleak films to serve as a counterpoint to uplifting films, those uplifting films become meaningless.  This is especially true regarding a topic like addiction because a constant stream of positive films on that subject, with happy endings, diminishes the hell and actual dangers of addiction and serves to push the idea that you can always come back from the brink; the number of drug related deaths is proof of that.

If you want to sit through a film like this and be rewarded with some schmaltzy, shoe horned ending, watch the Lifetime network or a 70s era TV movie of the week.",1462579200,7,1778,4.645367412140575

Got on a good ""cocktail"" at last but there is Always ""bleed-through"" of manias & depressions. There is no cure. Not talk therapy (cognitive, behavioral, etc.) either.
The question I have about this film is: what do people do when they don't have a husband who makes tons of money? The psychiatric/rehab hospital is swank, elegant. It would be so much easier to recover in a single room with a comfy bed & good psychiatrist/nurses.
As it is, people like me go to overburdened clinics in big cities where you wait 4 months for an appointment. Try to hold it together when husband loses job after job (companies going bankrupt, etc.)

The actress portrays the shame and compulsion of addiction very well.  It's a difficult movie to watch because you are watching someone in a depression/addiction/hopeless cycle.  For some people there are no happy endings.  For others there are.  This isn't a movie about recovery.  It's more pre-recovery or lost in addiction/depression.  The emphasis is not on her time in rehab- that is barely touched upon.  This movie is about an out of control addiction.  The main character has so many of the realistic signs of active addiction.

I am only rating this 3/5 as it was a little too depressing for my tastes, but for acting ability and subject matter, I would rate it 5/5 for others that appreciate such a drama.  Based on her past comedic performances and my perceived personality of her, this seems like it would have been a disturbing role for her to play.  This is one of those roles that can get an actor out of their perceived comfort zone, and I think she did it very well.  Sarah portrays an unhappy wife/mother that spirals into self-destructive behaviors very quickly from the start of the film.

I kept waiting for some sort of a resolution, or a climax, or a plot twist... and just a wasteland of self-centeredness kept happening.

(If this is the best role he could get, he must bitterly regret having left the hit show...)(I kept thinking of him as married to this draggy woman, and that was why he was pursuing Alicia Florrick at the law firm... )
Sarah plays a depressed, unappreciative, lazy and self-absorbed female with no morals very well, who takes for granted her concerned, attentive, loving, exceedingly patient husband while largely ignoring their children to get high and have sex with a friend's husband.

Why? Several things. One, after going to Rehab for a month, she hasn't changed at all? Of course I know people who relapsed immediately after leaving, but still, I would have liked to have seem more of the process involved there which would explain WHY the character relapsed so quickly. For one, I would guess the Rehab counselor(s) did not address her Daddy issues at all, or if they did, they didn't do a very good job. For someone that was clearly as well-off as Laney, you'd think she and her husband could afford a better Rehab Center. I don't know, maybe I'm too close to this issue to judge this movie artistically rather than for the way it addressed the issue of addiction and mental health. I applaud all involved in this movie for addressing these complex issues, but I feel short-changed in that I gained little to no new insights into them.",1462320000,,1150,4.533653846153846

The writing was superb really showing the desperate loneliness and obsessive compulsive behavior of a woman caught in the throws of active drug/ alcohol addiction.

While I don't think the film was perfect, I think it was a good depiction of the battle so many face with depression/mental illness. And Sarah's performance was definitely stellar. I also highly recommend Melancholia with Kirsten Dunst if you are interested in this vein of film. The thing that makes me the most sad about both films/stories is that while there is definitely a physiological issue and or chemical imbalance going on, there is also the fact that both lead characters are surrounded by or have been damaged by some seriously horrible, asshole-ish people in their lives. Ugh. So what to do -- especially in real life? Ongoing therapy for past traumas seems a given, but do we have the strength to break away from the people who currently hurt us or torment us? Sometimes making a complete break with the jerks is easier said than done. Sigh. The human condition ...",1462060800,,927,4.693251533742331

And as far as the ending of the movie goes, I felt as though I should have used the time it took me to watch the movie, to work on my personal recovery or to try and find someone else to help.  The only reason I gave this movie three stars, I feel there was at least an attempt to show how tough recovery... TRUE RECOVERY, is extremely tough, at best. To strengthen and protect one's personal recovery... for me, this remains the hardest thing that I've ever done.

As a child of an alcoholic, this hit very close to home for me. When Laney goes to rehab, she is really trying to break away from her addition and focus on her family, but as many addicts do, she relapses. I found her husband's character a little bit puzzling, though. I'm not sure why he isn't angrier with her at the beginning of the movie when it's obvious that she's neglecting their children and having an affair.

She has a hard time with the side effects such as weight gain and goes off her meds. The movie does not say anything about there being much better medications with fewer side effects that now exist. Lithium does work but is a very old medication with bad side effects. That results in many bipolars going off there meds as soon as they are doing better and back into a real nightmare.

But if you've ever known anyone who just can't seem to get their act together or runs their life off in the ditch and you don't understand WHY they're doing it...it helps you understand just a little bit that it truly doesn't have to be logical or anything you can understand, that in fact they don't understand it either, but they just can't function as Normal.

Truth is, she should BE committed. Spare them all her acting out. Some really wonderful supporting actors involved here: Terry Kinney, Tom Sadoski, Chris Sarandon, in some not so remarkable roles.

She tries rehab and confronting her past in an effort to cure herself. This is not a happy movie, at all. Let me just open with that. Sarah Silverman delivers an Oscar worthy performance and the movie is worth watching just for that. The movie itself though tries to just force its subject down your throat and ends up becoming to messagey to have the impact it wants. That is a real problem because if they backed off on trying to show how bad things can get and just relied on Silvermans performance it would have had more of an impact.

I will definitely look forward to her next project in film if she takes on another dramatic, serious and complex character, but I hope that she chooses a better director/producer/screenwriter combo next time.
The subject of ""Addiction"" is so often stereo-typed and depicted in such an incorrect way medically, in Hollywood; addicts being portrayed as degenerates and horrible people with no willpower; rather than our brothers, sisters, spouses, neighbors, friends, etc.who are sick, have a medical illness, a disease; and are perhaps spiritually bankrupt and need treatment. I mean to say addiction is real and affects real people we know and love and rather than wrap a stigma around it, we should embrace it with more lovingkindness and educate the masses on positive ways to deal with addiction rather than replay the wreckage and war stories associated with the disease; this only propagates the confusion and associate more shame and guilt with the diseased addict.  Our sick fellow human beings and loved ones would have much better a chance at acceptance and recovery than isolation. That said, there are those addicts that will not ever seek to recover unless they hit a rock bottom, and others that are dying every minute. Nonetheless, Silverman did play this character well and did a good job portraying the addicted wife, mother, individual, and was able to tug on the viewer's heart to identify with the pain; so I'm betting her intentions were good in taking on and succeeding at this part, but the film makers screwed it up.

Because her character never makes any kind of an epiphany about life or herself, the film is an exercise in despair.  The big life lesson you get at the film's conclusion seems to be to never have anal sex in an alley.  The cast all do well in delivering their lines and creating characters; the trouble is in the lack of a strong script and plot points that matter.  There is no healing to be found in this film, just bleakness and a sense of horror that the woman in this film is both monster and victim.
