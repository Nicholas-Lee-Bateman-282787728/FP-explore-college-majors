1068698,5,6305778256,"Amazing performance by all the cast. The main female lead gives a glowing performance above all others, not only is the story compelling and enthraling, for a tv movie this is an outstanding example of how things  should be done. You can't go wrong with this one.",958780800,,263,4.595744680851064
1068699,1,6305778256,"The beginning of the movie is the only bright spot in this atrocious remake!  Once they start going into the earth, it looks cool, but once they get to that village, everything plummets downhill-- FAST!  The acting is  passible, but the music is so bad, I wanted to throw up!  The story is  equally bad, and the script wasn't a great achievement either.  Take my  advice and skip this one.  You'll be glad you did!",957830400,5,414,4.426666666666667
1068700,5,6305778256,"This is one of my favorite movies.  It has everything that you would expect.  And the girl in the movie is quite beautiful.  It's not her looks, although they are nice, it's her persona and the idea of her that is so  attractive.  The first five or six times that I watched it, I got chills  whenever I saw her...!  It's like when  the person you care for touches  your hand for the first time...  WOW ...  It's a beautiful feeling.
And  young Jonas Litton (Jeremy London) following his uncle into the earth is  searching himself and life, finding out who he is and how he fits into the  world.  Very innocent and personally nostalgic.
Treat Williams'  performance is amazing.  If you didn't know Treat was an actor you'd think  that they went out and found a professor and asked him to play the part of  Theodore Litton.  So convincing is his performance that its  scary..!
Although parts of this movie are kinda cheesy and the caves  underground are mysteriously lighter than they should be it is still a good  movie.
I recommend it to everyone who has a creative and imaginative  spirit.  It's a fun ride.",957312000,5,1108,4.50253807106599

The Best part of this movie is there is no SEX and Cursing (I think that is why people gave it  negative reviews.)
I am sick and tired of watching two actors get naked and jump in bed or actors cursing an swearing every other word.
I like watching this movie often, because you feel like you are going on an adventure and actors make it entertaining.",1394236800,,554,4.276190476190476

1068754,1,6305778256,My 9 year old son and I watched this movie this week. It started off great. We enjoyed the first part ... then they made it to the center of the earth where life was all about getting high and have sex with strangers. I would NOT recommend this movie for a child under teen years.,1390780800,,280,4.017857142857143

1068796,5,6305778256,This is a awesome movie. i saw three versions of this movie and i'd have to say this one was pretty good. i think it went into more detail than the others. the actors were pretty good. hallmark movies are pretty good in general. i have not seen a bad one yet. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1352073600,,315,3.9375
1068797,4,6305778256,"My wife and I were pleasantly surprised. We were afraid it would be a cheesy, low budget film with terrible special effects. We found it a well made production which really transported us to another interesting and exciting world with believable characters. It apparently put people off by its claim to be based on Verne's classic. It is, sort of, but if anything it owes a lot to Burroughs Pellucidar as well. One thing I liked is that the creatures live in an environment which could possibly support them. Something laughable in a recent film is a huge dinosaur and carnivorous plants in a landscape which doesn't look like you could find a rabbit. The lighting problem is somewhat explained but then, this is more science fantasy than hard core science fiction. We get a big dose of now discredited Darwinism which gives it an authentic 19th century atmosphere. I thought the lizard men were great, certainly after seeing so many costumed Gorillas in older films. All in all, a good four!",1339113600,2,992,4.773255813953488
1068798,3,6305778256,"I think we're at cross-purposes here. This movie should not be confused with or compared to the Jules Verne classic, which starred Pat Boone and other great actors. But, when you put a mini-series on DVD, you get the feel where they cut for commercials and cut for the next episode etc. This makes for a jumpy, quirky viewing experience. I just have fun with this movie, pure & simple. It's not a great work or anything resembling 'art'.....just a fun romp through a rather campy fare with some wonderful moments & characters, that sometimes don't even tie into the main plot!",1320624000,,576,4.6568627450980395
1068799,2,6305778256,"Any resemblance between this and the original Jules Verne classic is purely unintentional, an accident at best.  That they strayed from the source material is evident the moment this epic begins.  That they had no desire to lay claims to anything but Verne's title is also evident.  A cynic would push that suspicion one step further by stating the obvious; they hoped to cash in on Verne's book and its reputation.  Which makes this a cheat, fraud at the worst.  When certain expectations are offered but not given, purposely, that's the definition of a swindle.

All that aside, this is simply not a good feature; the title is the best thing about it.  The journey aspect was brief and then they became landlocked, embroiled in a get rich quick scheme (seven years in the making, something that was not explained in the story).

They should have named this movie something else so I wouldn't have bothered buying it.  Not a keeper.",1320192000,,933,4.745341614906832
1068800,2,6305778256,"This movie is not bad enough to be good and not good enough for a second viewing.  The acid test for many movies is ""do you care about the characters"".  I found myself wishing that the monsters at the Center of the Earth would eat Treat Williams and his co-stars quickly, to avoid a 3 hour slog full of wooden acting, stilted dialogue and primitive special effects.  I agree that the human-like lizard monsters were pretty cool, and the whole center of the earth environment was pretty cool.  Trim this puppy down to a solid 70 minutes and you might have had a cult classic - but alas, not a mini-series.  If you can buy a used copy for about the price of a video store rental, as I did, then it is still worth a purchase.  One thumb half way up is better than none.",1296172800,2,766,4.212328767123288

Amazon.com was kind enough to refund my money.
In the meantime I can my VHS copy away, I would like the DVD, but I don't want to get another bad copy.",1259971200,,294,3.6825396825396823

1068803,4,6305778256,"The classic Jules Verne novel, Journey to the Center of the Earth, is brought to life in this movie. It stars: Treat Williams, Jeremy London, Bryan Brown, Tushka Bergen and Hugh Keays-Byrne. Directed by George Miller, it tells the story of a man named Theo Lytton who, along with his nephew, is hired by Alice Hastings to search for her husband who's been lost for over 7 years. She, along with a man named MacNiff, join the party on their trek that leads them deep inside Earth and eventually to its' center. Given, Miller has taken alot of liberties with his telling of the classic story as opposed to the book but, overall, Journey is actually a pretty good movie. Clocking in at around 4 hours, this is a movie that doesn't disappoint. At least, it didn't disappoint me. I loved the movie. Normally, movies of this type are a real chore for me to get through but this one seemed more like a two hour movie than a four hour one because it was so good. I'll agree with another reviewer here that there are no academy performances and it isn't an oscar winning film. What it does, though, it does well.

I was lucky enough to get this movie along with another Jules Verne classic called The Mysterious Island in a two movie set in a bargain bin. For some strange reason, I ended up purchasing it and I'm glad I did. This Hallmark Entertainment movie is brilliant. You'll love it.",1226448000,4,1380,4.454545454545454

1068857,3,6305778256,"The achievements of animation in adapting this story in preceding years would continue to overshadow the resumption of live action versions in the 1980s and 1993.  In early 1996, executive producer Robert Halmi, Sr., whose Hallmark Entertainment was simultaneously making a new version of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA for CBS (which eventually formed the basis for a two-hour telefilm and a one-hour children's special the next year) announced a two-hour version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH for the Sci-Fi Channel, from a script by John Ireland.  In the wake of the commercial success of the USA Network's four-hour mini-series of MOBY DICK (1998), the project was switched to USA, the Sci-Fi Channel's parent company, and the two-hour telefilm was expanded to four hours (including commercials) with Thomas Baum enlarging Ireland's script.  Director George Miller, already attached to the project, was eager for the change, and produced with Connie Collins.  Shooting began in April 1999 in Australia and New Zealand on a $12 million budget, and the miniseries premiered five months later on September 14 and 15.

 The setting is given as 1868 and adapts the nationality and names of its protagonists to the cast.  Instead of the German Professor Otto Lidenbrock, the hero is the American name-alike Theodore Lytton.  As portrayed by 47-year-old Treat Williams, Lytton is as much an action hero as part of the world of science, thereby surmounting the unlikelihood of a man of his constitution suriving the expedition.  He studied with Darwin in the Galapagos, and is a rather dominating father-figure to his initially fearful young nephew, Jonas, who is indispensable to his uncle for having a facility for languages that Lytton lacks.

 Alice Hastings, a wealthy American mountaineer and member of the Carnegie family, hires Lytton to search for her husband, Casper.  Casper had climbed down in a remote part of New Zealand, the Ruapehu caverns, that descend deep inside the Earth and are rumored to be an area of monsters and mystery.  This new narrative strand is only one of several changes that incorporate aspects of another Verne novel, his 1867 epic, The Children of Captain Grant, much of which is set in Australia and New Zealand.  Just as Mary Grant is part of the trek looking for her father, which will end in her marriage, Alice is part of the expedition in search of her husband, which will eventually bring her a new spouse.

 Verne's phlegmatic Icelander Hans is replaced with the burly, kilt-wearing MacNiff.  He integrates the Scotsman MacNabbs and the underhanded Ayrton from The Children of Captain Grant, and is wily enough to steer the Lytton party through the dangers of a colonial rebellion and hostile Maoris.

 Unlike previous films of Journey to the Center of the Earth, the descent is in a tropical climate filled with vegetation. Wind blowing Alice's hair reveals a passage emerging on the shore of the underground sea, with the cavern roof supported by pillar-type columns of rocks, perhaps the most impressive visualization yet achieved. A shift of natural colors is used to convey an other-worldly impression, with a yellow sky and blue plants.

 On the shore, Jonas glimpses and follows Ralna, a remarkably agile, tattooed redhead, who leads them into a jungle were they encounter two new races.  There is a primitive but more physically developed humankind, together with a reptile race, Saurians, that has developed on a parallel path, with its own language, science, and urban centers in a world where human and dinosaur coexist.  Alice is abducted by the Saurians, and in the human village Lytton, Jonas, and MacNiff find Casper, living as their ruler, in a manner reminiscent of a cult leader or Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.

 While the subterranean world is offered as an example of a different outcome of Darwin's theories, the theme is insufficiently explored, and the second half of the miniseries is disappointing, the filmmaker's refusing to allow the journey itself to serve as the goal, as in the novel.

 Miller's version further demonstrates how films of Verne's novel and Conan Doyle's Lost World, itself inspired by the Frenchman's book, have become a source of shared inspiration for filmmakers.  Conan Doyle's novel was even more concerned with the rivalry of races of prehistoric man than the better-remembered perils provided by dinosaurs.  During the production of this version, two new films of The Lost World were made, one a pilot for a television series shot in New Zealand, so certainly the ideas from the Conan Doyle novel were very much ""in the air.""

 Casper dies on the return journey, and crossing the underground sea again, Jonas, Lytton, and Alice are abruptly sent to the surface by a vortex phenomenon.  Lytton and Alice decide to honeymoon in Iceland, and explore fresh caverns that may offer a more direct route to the center of the Earth (which has the curious effect of making the Verne novel seem like a sequel to this film adaptation).

 Jonas must recover from an unknown virus transmitted by Ralna, that leaves him with dreams of her and causes him to return to New Zealand and a life of adventure--clearly leaving the way open for a sequel.  The theme of Jonas's initiatory trajectory and his gradual emergence as a hero during the course of the journey remains from the novel, despite deviating from Verne's own romantic conclusion (which the Lytton-Alice nuptials render superfluous).",1210896000,16,5492,5.044296788482835

What surprises us most is human-like dinosaur as a result of ""parallel evolution"", which in itself is intriguing idea.

Verdict: Even being Jules Vernes novel fan the movies offer some surprises.

I didn't hold the cheesy computer animation against it, but once the second half of the DVD started, it was all over. The big mess with the natives slows the movie's already molasses-like momentum to the speed of earth's continental plates, as mentioned in the movie.

The original movie's effects--seen as cheesy by action movie fanatics of this generation--were very good for that time period. Given that this movie was finished in 1999 shows that the computer effects were done with the remaining minute amount of the movie's budget.

Again, I don't hold the computer animation and the poor background (you can tell it's crinkled up paper for rocks in some instances); however the drawn-out plot makes me want to pull my hair out (or simply leave the room).",1121472000,,1011,4.771428571428571

I feel strongly that this movie has a lot going for it, but to truly appreciate it, you have to begin with one thing in mind:  This is NOT the Jules Verne classic!  This movie is not an attempt to re-create the original story (or even the classic movie starring James Mason), so if you purchase or rent this movie believing that is what you're going to find- forget it.  It seems that the majority of reviewers are spending too much time trying to grade this movie against the original- their main dissapointment stemming from the fact that it is NOT the original.  I believe, that if viewed as a stand-alone sci-fi miniseries, this has a lot going for it:  A well-written story with interesting and well-balanced characters, stunning scenery and visual effects, a fine pacing, and interesting concepts.  The ""suarians"" are very interesting creatures, and are visually stunning in execution.

Hallmark once again you have taken a classic story that all ready had a great movie of it and you made a second rate copy. On it's best day it can't hold a candle to the 1959 version with James Mason and Pat Boone. I can only hope since another great movie, Mysterious Island, is finally coming out on DVD October 29th, that perhaps they will put the original Journey to the Center of the Earth on DVD as well soon.

Potentially enjoyable miniseries features a handful of awe-inspiring scenes, but is sunk by second-rate direction, terrible acting (Even from the typically reliable Williams) and writing, horrendous special effects, a grating musical score, and an uninteresting main conflict.

1068926,4,6305778256,"This adaption of Jules Verne's classic strays a lot but I found it rather enjoyable. I first saw it on TV when it was a two-parter and only caught the ending of the first part. I have always liked Treat Williams and the actor who plays the Scotsman, McNiff, whom I've seen in the Patrick Stewart version of Moby Dick.  I picked the video up at Hollywood video for a reasonable price and was amazed at how much I missed on TV. The best part, in my opinion, was the Boston bare-kuckle boxing match in the very beginning. I also liked the blue forest and the rival tribes. This movie, which is intended for youngsters, can be enjoyed by everyone. But a word to parents, though: some of the tribe's ritual dancing is a bit questionable for younger viewers. Overall a pleasant evening-at-home-with-the-kids film.",990835200,7,807,4.604166666666667
1068927,2,6305778256,"I quite enjoy Hallmark's tv series. They release remakes and adaptations of enjoyable fantasy movies and legends with a modern twist and great effects. Naturally I saw their stamp on this DVD and thought ""Great!"" Oh dear....what a shame.
This movie tries hard to be interesting and it is watchable, but only just. Explorers searching for a missing doctor make their way to the centre of the earth and get caught up in a conflict between two prehistoric races. There is almost nothing from Jules Verne's classic story here, as has been mentioned already, but I found even for a fan of fantasy this was much less than what I expected. I think it is fair to say that Hallmark relied on the cast and title to sell the movie rather than a decent script. It's lazy, uninspired and often very dull.",984182400,7,791,4.577464788732394

They're both named George Miller, but they are different people. One is from Australia and one is not. That is all.",970617600,,273,4.372549019607843
1068929,1,6305778256,"What the heck?  Why has Treat Williams been making such lousy movies?  And George Miller?  Is this the same George Miller who made the Mad Max movies?  I can't believe that the man who gave us ""The Road Warrior"" made  this embarrassing movie, too.  It seems to be true, though....
This is a  harmless enough movie, but prone to sentimentality, and very predictable  plot contrivances.  The villains are a breed of bipedal reptiles with huge  claws and frightening teeth who, when they jump our heroes, merely jump  them and try to wrestle them to the ground...they don't bite.  They don't  slash.  They wrestle. At one point, Treat Williams appears to kick off the  ""head"" of one of these beasts...or to knock off the headpiece of  the costume. (You don't see more than a few of these creatures at once,  although we are to believe there is a large society of them...clearly, the  producer did not have an adequate costume budget!)
I like camp, and there  is a certain campy element to this movie--intentional, I hope. The  subterranean tribe of humans who take our heroes, for instance, in are made  up of brutish, hairy, grunting men, and utter babes in two-piece bikinis.  They have wonderful midriffs. And they are not the least bit sexually  bashful.  What a break for our travellers! If this is deliberate camp, it's  played too straight really to work.
I dunno...rent it for the kids, I  guess. But don't incur any late fees with this one.  You'll be sorry.",963964800,2,1464,4.7063492063492065
1068930,1,6305778256,"A truly terrible film, not worth even the time it takes to read this review.  I can not but wonder why they would take a wonderful story like the Jules Verne novel and totaly ruin it ... There are very few things in  this film version that can be found in the novel, aside from the change of  location they change too much of the plot and in such a way as to make it  too rediculous to even laugh at.  The acting is mediocre at best, the  special effects are the same and the direction even worse along with the  terrible screenplay.  All in all, a waste of your money and worse, a waste  of your time.",962409600,6,602,4.033898305084746
1068931,1,6305778256,"I simply cannot believe the producers of this film had the nerve to call it JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH!  My family and I are purists when it comes to films based on classic literature and so needless to say when we  saw this video for sale we purchased it immediately sight unseen (a mistake  we will not likely repeat). Expecting a delightful adaptation of a fine  novel for the whole family we were horrified by the absurd handling of  Jules Verne's work (shame on Hallmark).
Aside from the poor acting and  shallow, one dimensional and unbelievably predictable characters you have  once again Hollywood's ridiculous predilection with taking the previous  century's works and turning them into politically correct pablum for the  superficial minds of the late twentieth century movie watcher.
Rebel  against the presupposition that the average viewer isn't interested in good  literature being accurately adapted for the screen.  Spare yourself this  piece and watch one of A&E's recent great productions or one of those  done by PBS or the BBC.  Let this film find its way to oblivion where it  belongs.",962236800,,1114,4.9728260869565215
1068932,1,6305778256,"UGHHH! How shall I begain? This movie is one of the worst versions of the story that I have ever seen!  Just how is this ""based on the novel by Jaules Virn""? What,because the title is the same? My problems with  this film? Shall I count the ways:
1. In the book,they're guide was  Icelandish. In this one,he's Scottish(!) with an accent so thick that half  the time it sounds like hes barking. Not only that but he fills every  stereotype of a scott,e.g Drinks alot,eats meat raw,is crude,wears a beard,  etc. I'm surpprized that he didn't wear a celt and play the bag  pipes.
2. In the book,no dinosaurs!  Sure there were sea serpents,giant  turtules,and mamoths.but not really any dinosaurs. In this  ""movie"",dinosaurs are just about as common as air. Including  dinosaurs in a story is good,but make them plusable. I don't fake-looking  computer animated dinosaurs would evole down there with out  change. Personaly I think  the dinosaurs looked more realistic as lizards  with horns and fins glued to them.
3. The computer-animated dinosaur the  crew kills is taken out with one shot. Right. And his comment afterwards is  ""I'm sorry,but all of my reserch tells me is these things are stricly  vegetarians"".I smirked at that immortal line.
4. When in the book do  dinosaurs evole into intelligent beings parelell to humans? Plus they are  ugly so they have got to be evil.
5. When in the book do they ever  encounter a human tribe that is white? The only thing that I can think of  is the giants which keep Mamoths as pets.
6. The producers sat down and  thought ""Now how to we make a redwood forest look like a jungle at the  center of the earth...I know! Let's spray paint it blue!
7. The love  interest:The native red-hair women has virtully no facal expression at all!  Thoughout the entire movie she just looks bug-eyed and her mouth hangs  open! And our hero is some how attracted to this zombie!
Just when you  think your head is going to explode,you find that it's over and then you  realize that this movie is in two parts! You are only half way though  it!
Good bye everyone! Spare your self pain,don't watch this movie!",961027200,3,2134,4.613333333333333
