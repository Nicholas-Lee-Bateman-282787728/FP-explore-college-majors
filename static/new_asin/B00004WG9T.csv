7925167,5,B00004WG9T,"This is a great place to start if you wish to find more out about this phenomenon known as Red Dwarf, however, if you have a DVD player I would spring for the set on DVD of which you can now find series I and II, plus a load full of extra goodies. If you still don't have a DVD player and are looking for a good excuse the Red Dwarf series on DVD is it.
The first episode ""Kryten"" - is the very first appearance of that beloved mechanoid, Kryten. Although the character is rather lame in this episode there are aspects of which are hilarious. The fact that Kryten's senility has propelled him into caring for three long-dead beautiful women in a Norman Bates-like manner is very funny.
The second installment is ""Better Than Life"" - one of my favorites where Rimmer dooms the entire crew to be eaten alive by fire ants with his neurotic persona.
The final episode in series 2, byte 1 is ""Thanks for the Memory"" a very interesting plot where the crew lose their memories and try to find out what went on and who exactly is Lisa Yates?",1048809600,2,1033,4.275510204081633

Kryten introduces the  4000 series mechanoid, albeit played by another actor with a terribly  irritating tendency to whine. Still, watching the Boyz from the Dwarf gussy  themselves up for their big dates is laugh out loud hysterical.
Better  Than Life is wickedly funny, and extremely disturbing considering the level  of computer gaming the future may hold for us. The crew find a virtual  reality game where all their fantasies come true (much like Star Trek's  holodeck). The problem is, they're playing this game with  Rimmer...
Thanks for the Memory is one of my favorites. Rimmer gets  plastered on his death day. The next morning, Lister and the Cat have  broken legs, there's remnants of an alien encounter, and who the heck is  Lisa Yates? Too bad they've all lost their memories.
Please, watch Red  Dwarf! It's fantastic!",967766400,7,1098,4.864864864864865
