7269232,5,B00YTSKJ9Q,Happy with purchase.,1447027200,,20,6.0
7269233,5,B00YTSKJ9Q,"Caillou and his imagination are back in a fun holiday DVD, which includes 13 family-friendly Halloween stories that are entertaining and imaginative. I also like that it continues with the creativity with family fun arts and crafts suggestions on the inside of the DVD package. I like that Caillou also faces real little kid problems such as in being afraid of the dark and monsters as in Caillou is Afraid of the Dark. Younger children and parents can relate to Caillou and I give this one 5 stars for its social, emotional and entertainment value. Caillou does teach real life lessons and is not just fun to watch. Ages recommended are 2-6.",1445385600,,642,4.741071428571429

7269235,5,B00YTSKJ9Q,"Still waiting for this to come in the mail, but the kids are super excited. My kids love ALL Caillou and it is hard to find the holiday episodes. Was so happy to see they finally put the fall/ halloween episode on one DVD. Some of the other ""winter"" dvd's are not all winter and that can be disappointing.",1442793600,,305,4.186440677966102
7269236,5,B00YTSKJ9Q,"My then 3 (when purchased) now 4 yr old really likes Caillou (moved on recently to other shows). Some people say he is super whiny, which he most definitely is, but that's why we teach our kids as their parents not to behave like that. He does teach other good lessons though. My child has learned quiet a bit from Caillou. But just like any shows they watch there will be good and bad from them. some things we may like as parents some we may not. So we take the good, and teach them what the bad are and how to properly act and behave.",1470441600,2,537,4.0754716981132075

7269245,3,B00YTSKJ9Q,"I don't know if mine was faulty or if I didn't read the description right, but this has a few episodes on the disc but after one episode ends, it repeats the same episode before moving on to the next. It didn't make sense to me.",1447718400,,228,3.9782608695652173

8719197,1,B00YTSKJ9Q,I love Caillou and so does my grandaughter but this dvd is scary. She cried at most of it. She was terrified by the bedtime monster. I don't understand why they put that on this video.,1476748800,,184,4.138888888888889
8719198,2,B00YTSKJ9Q,"Caillou is a favorite in our house. Mostly, because it is a wholesome and calm show for our LO to watch. Even though the price on this is low, I feel I need to let others know what they're buying. Episodes are only about 5 minutes long, before you hear the ending song after each one (gets a little old). Also, only the first TWO (5 min) episodes are about trick-or-treating. After that, there are some fall related and mildly spooky episodes. For some reason, episode 3 AND 7 on my disc had audio issues with popping noises blocking the sound. It appeared they were older episodes and even the colors were different. The technical issue is the reason for the 3 stars.",1474502400,3,668,4.439024390243903
