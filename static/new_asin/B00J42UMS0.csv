6332589,5,B00J42UMS0,we had a chance to watch the first DVD tonight.  the scenery was breathtaking.  Occasionally there were comments from park rangers or other individuals with knowledge of the area.  this information was to give the viewer a more in-depth appreciation of what they are about to see.,1415404800,13,280,4.914893617021277

Wow, what a neat idea! We first saw the canyon from the Colorado River on a float trip. What a difference from looking up to looking down.",1406851200,,307,4.310344827586207
6332593,5,B00J42UMS0,"Howdy;

Some have said that the title ""The Grand Canyon"" is false and I do agree to a point.  It would have been better is it was titled ""The Colorado Plateau"", but I will not lose any sleep over it.  And I don't feel any less of the series for it.  The way I look at it is I get seven national parks and several other sites on one disc.  You can't beat that even with a petrified stick.

The running time is 80 minutes.

6332594,2,B00J42UMS0,"I bought it to see the Grand Canyon.

But the bluray is about the Colorado Plateau and its National Parks.

Grand Canyon is just at the end and lasts only 9 minutes, half of which is an interview by a geologist.

What a disappointment for me who expected most of all to see wonderful landscapes of the Grand Canyon itself.

Don't waste your money by buying this bluray.

Sorry for my bad English.",1376352000,,396,4.36986301369863
6332595,4,B00J42UMS0,"This video covers the following US National Parks of the Colorado Plateau

Grand Canyon NP
Painted Desert/Petrified Desert NP
Arches NP
Canyonlands NP
Canyon De Chelly National Monument
Bryce NP
Zion NP
Mesa Verde NP
Lake Powell National Recreation Area

So most parks only have about 5 minutes of video.  But since I visited each, it was nice buying only 1 video to cover all of them.

The video mostly concentrates on the geology of the parks.  And there is a section covering the Colorado Plateau as a whole.  It is not a travel log like some other blu rays.

Overall, not bad.  But there were some disappointments which include:

1. Canyonlands is a beautiful park.  But instead of showing views of it, they talked about Indian petro graphs.
2. The best views in Bryce are from the Navajo trail.  But it did not include video from that location.
3. All the views from the Grand Canyon are from the south rim - none from the north rim.
4. The commentary from the geologist, park ranger and historian were nice.  But they should have showed views of the parks when they talked rather than showing the person.
5. The video had nice background music.  But it was stopped when the geologist or ranger or historian talked.

Overall, not bad and a good value for the price.  But if you want a video only of the Grand Canyon, then this one is not for you.",1373500800,2,1351,4.479508196721311
6332596,1,B00J42UMS0,"This movie is titled ""The Grand Canyon"".  I only paid $3.99 for a Bly-Ray version so had no expectation that this was a great video.  Based on its cheesiness the most I could have given it would have been 3 stars.  How did it end up with only 1-star?  Read on.

There is not much positive I can say about this video.  There is a belief that Blu-Ray videos are going to have fantastic picture quality.  Not so here.  It is grainy and has dancing pixels in most of the location footage (you can tell it's not the transfer or the DVD player because the interview scenes look fine).  Several times I had the impression it was shot with a cell phone camera.  The scripting is atrocious.  Here's an exaggerated example of his writing style:  ""The rocks are red. They are red because of sediment. Sediment that formed over millions of years.  Years that happened a long time ago.  A long time ago because it wasn't recent"".  After the first half-hour of listening to virtually every sentence begin with the last word of the previous sentence it was hard to take the video seriously without giggling at the amateurish writing (apparently the guy who made the video pretty much was a one-man-band).  The narrator has the emotion of a corpse and listening to his sibilant ssss's was like fingernails on a chalkboard.  I know this was low-budget but didn't anyone think of a simple breath filter in front of his microphone?

All of the above might have earned 3-stars for an ""average effort"" so why did I rate it only 1-star?  Because this video is NOT about the Grand Canyon and the video's maker claims it is.  Only about 7 minutes out of 1hr/20min program length is directly related to the Grand Canyon and of that maybe about 2-3 minutes of video (made up of little clips that are a few seconds each) is actually shot at the Grand Canyon and the rest of it is some guy rambling on-camera on about who-knows-what. The movie's remaining video footage?  Most of it was filmed up to 200 miles away in Utah and Colorado which looks nothing like the Grand Canyon (the video maker has an obvious fetish with ""The Colorado Plateau"" as it is mentioned dozens of times). I suspect the guy who filmed it didn't want to file for the permits and pay the fees to GCNPS so he shot some ""home movies"" pretending he was a tourist.

The title ""Grand Canyon"" is a complete misrepresentation.  If you are considering buying this video because you likely will never visit the Grand Canyon ... don't.  After watching it you will be hopelessly confused which scenery was shot at the Grand Canyon (hint: only 2-3 minutes of the entire show) and you'll hardly know what the Grand Canyon even looks like.  If you are thinking of buying this video as an educational tool for your children, parental guidance is suggested ... explain to them that they are watching a video about a huge area of Southern Utah, Southwest Colorado, Northwest New Mexico and the Northeast corner of Arizona.  That way they can learn a little (very little) about that area of the American Southwest. It would be misguided for you to tell them that all of those pretty scenes the video maker has lumped into a video titled ""Grand Canyon"" are in or even remotely near the Grand Canyon.

It is rare I am so disappointed I give any product only 1-star.  This one is it.",1373155200,11,3308,4.523569023569023
6332597,5,B00J42UMS0,I love these outdoors dvd's they are really good especially if you probably won't make it there kinda lets you feel like you are there,1372291200,,134,4.4
6332598,5,B00J42UMS0,"It is hard to add something to the beauty that your eyes are going to watch through this travel. I must say that all our senses will be part of the travel. Sometimes, mostly... you go to the unknown. Sometimes you don't recognize if you are in The Valley of the Fairs of Turkey or in the States! Unfortunately as the subtitles in English don't exist it is impossible for me understand technical vocabulary that if it would have been written I could have looked up in the dictionary. I have been at the States many times but now I understand that what I have seen is very little.

6332599,1,B00J42UMS0,"We spent six days rafting on the Grand Canyon this summer, and were excited to watch a video that might help us relive the experience. Based on the title and the blurb, you might think you were going to watch a video ABOUT THE GRAND CANYON. You would be mistaken.

A better title for this movie would be The Colorado Plateau. Now, if we had started watching the video knowing this, we might have enjoyed it more, but as it was, we kept wondering, when are they going to talk about the Grand Canyon????

The video itself discusses the history, geology, and parks of the entire Colorado Plateau: Bryce, Zion, Arches, Canyonland, Lake Powell, and etc. It spends very little time actually talking about and showing the Grand Canyon itself.

The video was OK, if a little cheesy. As I said above, if it's title were accurate, I might have enjoyed it more, but as it was, I spent the whole time wondering why I was wasting my time.",1356998400,9,925,4.461538461538462

We went to the Grand Canyon with a Geologist who showed us around similar to this DVD.  They show you around and the beauty shows how it really gathers the attention of tourists!  It's beautiful.  I felt like I was in the helicopter flying along with the photographer who did the beautiful photography.

6332604,3,B00J42UMS0,"This DVD was a disappointment because the label leads the viewer to the impression that the DVD is about the Grand Canyon.  In face, the Grand Canyon is only seen slightly in this video.  The video spends most of its time featuring the Colorado Plataeu, of which the Grand Canyon is a part of.  The video also spends time featuring other national parks in the immediate area like Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, etc.  Don't get me wrong, the vistas on this Blu-ray disc are spectacular.
