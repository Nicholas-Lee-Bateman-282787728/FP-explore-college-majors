8699548,4,B00SWFMBIY,"When called upon, Spencer Tracy can do tortured with the best of 'em. He's certainly a champion brooder in 1935's hard-boiled crime drama, THE MURDER MAN. Tracy plays alcoholic ace reporter Steve Grey who we first glimpse minutes into the film, asleep on a merry-go-round. The hard-charging editor of the New York Daily Star has deployed his minions who waste no time in tossing the various New York City bars and dives in search of the paper's golden-haired boy.

A woman had leapt off a ferry boat to her death. A womanizing investor (Lionel Atwill, predictably on a heel turn) is mysteriously gunned down near a shooting gallery. Naturally, a sitch like that requires the presence of Steve Grey, him what they call ""the Murder Man,"" seeing as how he covers all the murder stories. Probably still under the influence, nursing a raging migraine, tormented by undeclared inner demons, Steve Grey works the case, gets his headlines in. You could sense his heart isn't in it.

I'd never seen Virginia Bruce do better than when she played Mary Shannon in this film. Mary writes the Daily Star's advice column. More importantly, she's in love with Grey, even though she thinks it's a hopeless cause. Grey is simply too steeped into his personal hell. In 1935 James Stewart was still a few years away from stardom. I think MURDER MAN may even have been his first feature film. He lands a minor role as an obliging cub reporter nick-named ""Shorty.""

THE MURDER MAN combines elements of the police procedural with the newspaper drama. Those who soak in nostalgia will relish the bustle of the newspaper office. This was during an era in which them coppers willingly cooperated with the fourth estate, or at least old-school Hollywood cinema would lead you to believe it's so. Steve Grey, star journalist and devoted dipsomaniac, takes part in the police's murder investigation. He even drums up several leads.

The cast is solid, with a particular nod to Virginia Bruce. But THE MURDER MAN, riveting and bittersweet, rests squarely on Spencer Tracy's shoulders, and he delivers with a ferociously stark performance. You never doubt that he'll solve the mystery and corner the killer. But how did that shock reveal hit ya?",1457827200,,2214,4.896

8699550,5,B00SWFMBIY,"""The Murder Man"" was Spencer Tracy's  {ST} first movie for MGM. He signed a long term contract with Metro in 1935 after making 19 {mostly forgettable} films for Fox Pictures from 1930 -35 of  which only two {2} ""Twenty  Thousand Years at Sing Sing"" and ""The Power and the Glory"" {see my 4/30/2013 review} were worthy of his talents.  The signing of ST was one of the last coups of MGM production genius Irving Thalberg before his premature death in 1936 and  ST would with Metro's carefull handling and his own enormous talent become a superstar at MGM for the next 2 decades.

This film has the feel of an Warner  Brothers pre-code crime melodrama in its storyline, sharp / punchy dialogue and modest production values.and it fits ST personna perfectly. He plays a beligerent drunken  outspoken ""ace reporter"" {Steve Gray / SG}  who specializes in covering  and writing on high profile Homicide cases / trials  for a great metropolitan newspaper -  who as it turns out  he is not for ""Truth Justice and the American Way"" but uses his power and knowledge of criminal procedures to railroad an innocent man to the death house for a murder that he didn""t commit. The scenario  presents  the  unfortunate victim as a  liar,  cheat and  swindler, he is  certainly a  bad guy but is not guilty of  the murder. It  is for REVENGE for his wife's suicide that SG engineers his state sponsored death and even taunts him about knowing that he is innocent . How the murder plot  is discovered and unravels is  compelling and well written.

As usual MGM provided an outstanding supporting cast - Robert Barrat as the  newspaper editor constantly at loggerheads with SG, Virginia Bruce  as the adoring, long suffering  girlfriend and Lionel Atwill as the patient and dogged police inspector who  peels back the  deceptions Gray has placed in his path in order to solve the mystery. AND in two small but showy roles - a young Jimmy Stewart as a cub reporter and William Demarest  {as  usual} sharp, tart and gruff .

This is a really nice flick -  not the usual polished MGM product but with suspense, grit and a nice performance by Spencer Tracy and I give it a five star rating - recommended",1454889600,3,2179,4.6299212598425195
8699551,3,B00SWFMBIY,"The Murder Man is a newspaper/crime drama from 1935 starring Spencer Tracey. Newspaper based stories were popular beginning with The Front Page (1931) and including Dance Fool Dance (1931), It Happened One Night (1934), Front Page Woman (1935), Love on the Run (1936), and Libeled Lady (1936).

Spencer Tracey (1900-67) plays the reporter. He received 9 Oscar nominations and won twice  Captains Courageous (1937) and Boys Town (1938) - although personally I think Inherit the Wind (1960) and Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) were his best performances. This was Traceys first film for MGM, where he reigned for decades.

Pretty blond Virginia Bruce (1910-82) plays Traceys co-worker and love interest. She was popular in the 30s in films like Kongo (1932), Jane Eyre (1934), Shadow of Doubt (1934), and The Great Ziegfeld (1935). Bruce married silent screen star John Gilbert

Lionel Atwill (1885-1946) plays a police inspector. He was the king of the B horror films and best remembered as Inspector Krogh, the man with the wooden arm, who hunts down the monster in Son of Frankenstein (1939) while managing to get in a game of darts with Basil Rathbone.  Atwill appeared in 5 of the 8 Universal Frankenstein films, and also had time for Mark of the Vampire (1935) and House of Dracula (1945) as well as several Sherlock Holmes films, the best of which was The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939).

Robert Barrat (1889-1970) plays Traceys editor. Barrat appeared in more than 100 films and is best known as Chingachgook in Last of the Mohigans (1936). He had memorable roles in Captain Blood (1935), Mary of Scotland (1936), and Northwest Passage (1940). In 1945 he played General MacArthur in They Were Expendable.

Jimmy Stewart (1908-97) has a small part as a reporter in his second film. Also look for William Demarest (My 3 Sons), Fuzzy Knight (Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion)

Tim Whelan (1893-1957) is the writer-director. Hes best known for The Thief of Bagdad (1940) and for his films about England - The Sidewalks of London (1938) and Clouds Over Europe (1939).

As a film about the goings on at a newspaper, this film is not great. Citizen Kane (1941) and The Front Page (1931) are the best. Other better than average films that feature newspapers include All the Presidents Men (1976), Deadline USA (1952) , Sweet Smell of Success (1957), and Ace in the Hole (1951), and Meet John Doe (1941).

1935 was a good year for films. Mutiny on the Bounty and The Informer were box office and Oscar winners. Other top 10 grossing films included Gable and Harlow in China Seas, Flynn and de Havilland in Captain Blood, Shirley Temple in The Littlest Rebel and Curly Top, and Greta Garbo in Anna Karenina. Other notable films released that year included Alice Adams with Hepburn, The 39 Steps, The Bride of Frankenstein, David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities, Les Miserables, Top Hat, and A Night at the Opera. In Germany, Leni Riefenstahl released Triumph of the Will.

Overall the film is ok. Tracey does his usual good job, and the supporting cast does well. The direction is a little slow and the sets are much too limited.",1441238400,3,3131,4.855534709193246

8699553,4,B00SWFMBIY,"I thought this was a good movie.  I had never seen it before but had a feeling it would end the way it did, I just didn't figure out the why and how. As small a role that Jimmy Stewart had, didn't diminish his presence.  You can tell, he had a natural talent!",1432512000,6,259,3.8679245283018866
