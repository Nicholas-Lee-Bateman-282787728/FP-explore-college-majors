8344404,3,B001NRC624,"This movie is definitely not one of the best that I've seen plot-wise, but it's overall ""goofiness"" makes up for all of that. With such classic songs as ""You are my Samosa,"" ""Traffic Jam,"" and ""Rock Dancer,"" you'll find yourself singing these silly songs to yourself. Really, the movie's only redeeming quality is the wonderfully horrible soundtrack.

Just to give you an idea of the lyrics, here are some from ""Rock Dancer,"" the title track:

We are freelancers We are rock dancers Like Mickey Mouse I'm gonna bring down the house Like Donald Duck I don't give a Quack etc.

So if you're looking for a quality script, don't bother with Rock Dancer. But if you're looking for a ridiculous movie with goofy songs, then this is the movie for you.",1300752000,,744,4.66412213740458
