J.M. Brooks, you are correct: Mr. Dressup aired in the US (probably for places close enough to the border, or via satellite). I used to watch Mr. Dressup in the States. I got CBC (CBLT) on cable in NY (still do) and flash back to my childhood every now and then when, upon flipping stations, I sometimes see an episode on the air.

2156038,5,B0003PE4PY,"I loved Mr. Dressup as a kid .  I do have to disagree with the reviewer that said it never aired in America.  I'm not sure what station it was on, but I remember watching Mr. Dressup as a kid growing up in Michigan (maybe we were picking up a Canadian station, who knows, I was 4!).  At any rate, this was a wonderful show that I still remember fondly and will watch again with my children.",1138233600,,390,4.038961038961039
2156039,5,B0003PE4PY,"Here in Canada, he was bigger than Mr. Rogers!

Although his show never aired in the U.S

nor did it have the budget of Sesame Street,

Mr. Dressup was huge!

For more than 30 years- every Canadian child tuned in

to watch this warm and caring man-

sing, dance and draw.

Joined by Casey & his dog- the three would

always keep us entertained with songs, plays

and the numerous costumes which were kept

inside the famous ""Tickle Trunk""

The show ended its long run in 1994.",1117497600,,476,4.35632183908046

8036004,5,B0003PE4PY,My kids grew up watching this great show.  Now I had to get them for the next generation of our family.,1395619200,,103,3.9047619047619047
8036005,5,B0003PE4PY,"I watched Mr. Dressup as a child and was absolutely thrilled to find it on Amazon! I immediately bought it for my kids! They love it as much as I did growing up! The memories it brought back for me were amazing and the memories it will create for them hopefully will do the same! This show is educational and teaches many wonderful lessons. Mr. Dressup is a leaps and bounds better then the shows they have on TV now. It is so nice to be able to look away and know that my kids are watching an innocent, imaginative, colorful, violent free show! Everyone with children should purchase this!",1391126400,,590,4.372727272727273
8036006,5,B0003PE4PY,"I grew up in Seattle and watched Mr. Dressup on on KCLW for years. It was probably my favorite show during early to middle childhood. It was educational and imaginative entertainment, that made such an impression, I came looking for the program on DVD. So happy to see these available!",1382054400,,285,4.72

8036008,4,B0003PE4PY,"Touted on the back ""Mr. Dressup brightened CBC's morning schedule for an incredible 32 years""...yet the best CBC video can come up with is a 75 minute DVD? Sure, this is a welcome addition and release for any sentimental Canadian, yet CBC has yet to put out enough vintage product to learn that collectors would enjoy more footage and bonus features that most reissue companies are apparently capable of. Let's breathe a heavy sigh of relief that unlike the rest of many Canadian TV treasures, CBC didn't opt to simply wipe the tapes or discard them! Friendly Giant, BeachCombers, bring it on! Even MORE Mr. Dressup would be most welcome, but 75 minutes seems to be just a teaser.",1321833600,3,680,4.722689075630252
8036009,5,B0003PE4PY,"I'm almost 30 now, but I enjoyed Mr. Dressup and never missed it when I was a child. I would like to buy this DVD, so my children can enjoy him as I did. Like majority of the previous posters, I am from Michigan and Mr. Dressup was  shown in our area. His show really helped expand my imagination and basically took me into his world while I watched. I feel his show helped me become who I am today in the professional world. The show promoted creativity and I became a creative writer and skilled art designer. I am now a marketing manager in charge of creating brochures, advertising, and other promotional media. I feel Mr. Dressup helped me get to where I am today. Thank you Mr. Dressup. Thank you for educating me while keeping my attention with a very entertaining show. Rest in peace!!",1165190400,11,793,4.394557823129252
8036010,5,B0003PE4PY,"I'd wished for some time for Mr Dressup on DVD before I found it - I should have known, as the show was so beloved by so many.  I don't know about it airing on any US stations, but like others along the northern US border, I watched it every day on CBC throughout the '70s.  I don't know if that technically counts as ""airing in the US"".

Anyway, I consider myself very lucky to have been able to grow up watcing it, and have often been frustrated when other Americans have no idea who Mr Dressup (or Casey, or Finnegan, or Aligator Al, etc) is.  These DVDs have proven quite popular in the short time I've had them, so I'm looking for more copies to give as gifts.

Oh, yeah...all the kids I know love it too.",1154649600,,710,4.115942028985507
8036011,4,B0003PE4PY,"this is not episodes these are three tapes that stroll down memory lane and they last 70 minutes. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE GOOD. I grew up in grosse pointe MI  and watched them forever, now my kids can enjoy.. which they do and they are 8 and 6 They also enjoyed watching new zoo review. Is it possible the shows I watched in the 70s were more intelligent that what my kids can watch today??? yes. Which is why I have searched high and low for these DVDS they totally rock if you did not grow up with them you will love them. I watched and cried my way through he was like the dad I never had. YOU SHOULD GET THESE DVDS ! they do not cater to kids like the new shows do they do not imply kids are stupid. They really challenge thinking and imagination.",1143590400,,745,4.068027210884353
