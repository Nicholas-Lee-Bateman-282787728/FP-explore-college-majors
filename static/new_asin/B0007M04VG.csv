The ""Perry Mason"" novels were a form of mystery stories where the detective is a lawyer and the solution occurs in a courtroom. A real life court trial is not this dramatic. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers with new technology or medical-legal facts, and warned of swindles. The TV shows were simplified versions of the originals or were new stories. Some criticized the tactics of Perry Mason but they represented life before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. They record the styles and culture of the 1960s. The many character actors who look like ordinary people enrich these stories, their emotions are often portrayed by their facial expressions. The prices, automobiles, and monetary figures date these stories, like the familiarity with firearms.

""The Case of the Bigamous Spouse"" begins in a kitchen where Gwynn cooks breakfast for the Grimes, a married couple she is staying with. Gwynn sells children's encyclopedias and visits a home and sees a picture of the husband of Nell Grimes! Gwynn visits Perry Mason for advice. Paul Drake will investigate. Gwynn returns to the Gillette home, and sees a man by her car. Is someone trying to harm her? Gwynn finds Frank Gillette's body but doesn't report it. Lt. Anderson takes her in for questioning. There was a report about the death of an old hermit. Perry and Della investigate, and check fingerprints. They learn about a photograph of a man in an old magazine. [Note how they try to get than man's fingerprints.] The witnesses testify at the Preliminary Hearing. George Baxter tells about finding the body. Carl Jasper tells what he saw the previous night: Gwynn driving by. What is the significance of that picture? A defense witness tells about new facts. Perry calls Gwynn to the stand to get more information. Perry uses these facts to point to another suspect. The last scene ties up the loose ends. Perry explains how the meeting with Mrs. Gillette occurred.
This was adapted from an Erle Stanley Gardner novel; note the better plot and legal language (""best evidence""). I wonder if this story was inspired by a true crime?
