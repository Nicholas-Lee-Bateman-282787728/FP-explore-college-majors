I watched this film with a drunken friend and band mate of mine in '92, on VHS; it had a funny impact on me, I hated it so much I couldn't stop laughing at the screen.
Plot: S&M without the actual realism, so it's a statement of society? No. White slavery, and how it ruined women's lives? No. How a pervert and his demented friend, felt disrespected by a critic; while locking up naked women, and training them to torture and cannibalize? YES...
This is the real plot, and it comes off as comical, and realistic; although not one actor is to blame for the poor script, but the bad acting doesn't take away from this movie.
there is no sex. and no erotic scenes

In the twisted tradition of such gore classics as THE WIZARD OF GORE and THE FLESH AND BLOOD SHOW comes Joel M. Reed's BLOODSUCKING FREAKS, a ghoulish gross-out from start to finish. Reed serves up a delicious platter of cannibalized remains, with side dishes of indignity and poor taste. One victim has her brains sucked out through a straw, while another is disemboweled by naked cat-women who dance around with his penis in hand. The absurdity doesn't stop there, as Sardu sends his miniature assistant out to kidnap more women to sell in their white-slavery ring. Seamus O'Brien plays up the black comedy in an outrageously over-the-top performance as Master Sardu. A cult film, to be sure, BLOODSUCKING FREAKS will play well with gore crowds that revel in cheap sexploitation.

I saw this movie about 20 years ago, out of curiosity after the recommendation of a friend, and regret having seen it. If you derive entertainment or thrills from watching women being graphically raped, tortured and killed,for absolutely no reason at all, then you are the demograph this film was created for.

769309,2,6304045425,"""Bloodsucking Freaks"" is indeed as demented and campy as its reputation suggests, but I found it to be much more dark and disturbing than do most who have seen the film.  This has mainly to do with just what exactly it is that the evil Sardu (Seamus O'Brien) does to the young women he and his dwarf henchman Ralpus (Louis DeJesus) have kidnapped in order to participate in his sadomasochistic stage shows.  Simply put, he psychologically traumatizes them to the point that they are stripped of their humanity and turned into unthinking animals.  In my opinion, this is a fate truly worse than just torture or death.  Much like the state authorities in George Orwell's ""1984,"" Sardu doesn't just want to enslave and murder these women, he wants them to actually love him as he is doing it.  The fate of the kidnapped ballerina Natasha deNatalie (Viju Krem) is the worst of all, as he brainwashes her so that she herself will commit murder in his next production.  Can you think of anything more cruel and evil than forcing an innocent person to become a murderer?  Well, that is exactly what happens to poor Natasha in the film.  No matter how funny you find Sardu and Ralphus's antics to be, you simply can't deny the essential darkness and tragedy at the heart of ""Freaks'"" story.  As a humanist who values life and liberty, I simply could not watch this film, as I have done twice, and not consider its darker implications.",1331424000,,1426,4.649402390438247
769310,4,6304045425,"Believe it or not, a motion picture with such a grotesque title as ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" (but which had been filmed as ""Sardu, Master of the Screaming Virgins"", then retitled ""The Incredible Torture Show"" for its original theatrical run) is, essentially, a ballet film, although there are only really a few minutes (central and climactic ones, however) of the crazed, ballerina-topless, murderously sadistic moments of dancing. One of two kidnapped ballerinas, Natasha, after having been tortured and brainwashed, in order to avoid having her feet chainsawed off, like those of her celebrated colleague, becomes the sado-masochistic love-slave of Sardu, the ugly white slaver entrepreneur, among whose murderous accomplices is the sadistic black dwarf, Ralphus.

As the climax of a choreographed ballet routine, Natasha kicks to death a bound captive critic (for real, folks!) with repeatedly powerfully swinging dance motions of her vicious, long, muscular, Terpsichorean-trained trotters. This is the best moment of the film, indeed, its very core, even if the ballet dancing is less skillful than that of the likes of Dame Margot Fonteyn, Maria Tallchief, Alicia Alonso, or Karen Kain. As for the other female dancer in the story, the one whose feet the dwarf has sawn off, that victim is left lugubriously to drag her bleeding stumps, her body facedown, across a floor revoltingly grotty with filth and gore. The principal ballerina, Natasha, for her part, having become a willing minion of Sardu, slays her gorgeous sports-celebrity boyfriend, Tom, stealthily lobbing an axe into the back of his handsome head while Tom has been trying to rescue her -- and a detective, too -- from Sardu. Unbeknownst to Tom, Sardu had become Natasha's new master and lover. Then there also are the awaiting threats from Sardu's minions and from his now liberated crazed she-demon cannibalistic, naked female caged horde, whose vengeance brings the movie to a close in a collective frenzy of vindictively murderous, cannibalistic violence.

There is lots more that flogs, viciously tortures, cannibalises, guillotines, amputates, and brutalises variously and bloodily its way through the length of the film. ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" is tasteless, explicit, exploitative, and grotesque. In a word, this is one of the best movies of its kind, even compared to a non-dance film that recounts, abounding in sex,  voyeurism, sadistic torments, and, in its case, drugs too, a somewhat similarly memorable tale, ""The Sinful Dwarf"" (the original Scandanavian title of which is ""Dvaergen""), which features a far uglier and weirder Caucasian midget.

By obtaining ""the Collector's Edition Director's Cut"" DVD (the North American edition being Troma Team Video DVD-9830), including numerous bonus features, the viewer can savour this strange film even further than by watching it, in full (and, admittedly, in more or less comparable visual quality) on YouTube. The reader knows if such movies as the one here reviewed and another singled out in this review for brief comparison are the kind of cult films (of ""high camp"" sensibility) that he likes best, i.e. movies which are so bad that, in their perverse ways, they are good!",1326412800,,3202,5.347222222222222
769311,5,6304045425,Great cult classic.  A must have for the video collection.  Hard to find but you can find anything on Amazon!!!,1323043200,,111,4.5
769312,2,6304045425,"So, a friend of mine sent me this DVD, a film most of us have heard of but probably not seen. If you haven't, count yourself lucky. Not that I regret it, but then, I'm one of those guys who wants to see and own a copy of every film ever made just so I can have a complete library and film knowledge. Anyway, ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" is about a smalltime theater owner who puts on sadism shows in which he tortures, dismembers, and murders women while pretending it is all just an amazing act. There's not a ton of plot, but what there is goes like this. Sardu is the sadistic showman who believes himself a true artist, and his dwarf assistant, who is possibly more sick than he is, is Ralphus. Together, they do truly disturbing things to women they kidnap, as well as run a white slavery racket on the side. Well, I guess it's their theater deal that is done on the side. Anyway, the plot, well, Sardu wants to put on a really special show and impress this critic he has kidnapped, so he kidnaps a famous ballerina and tries to convince her to dance in his gore act. Meanwhile, her boyfriend gets a crooked cop to help him track her down. That stuff is a little interesting, but most of the screen time is spent on showing the most misogynistic stuff I've ever seen in my life. I'm not usually one who gets offended by movies. It's all in good fun. However, this one really pushes it. I'm not really a gorehound either, frankly, but it's all just so gratuitous here that that's what really bothers me. I honestly gotta say, unlike Eli Roth, who provides an obsessive commentary track, I really don't buy this as a great work of art and social commentary. It seems to purely be trying to shock the viewer with how low it will sink throughout. Not that there's anything wrong with that if you like shock shlock, but the misogyny actually gets to be a bit too much for me from the get go. I mean, I'm not going to file a complaint anywhere or anything, it's all fake and it's from the seventies, just saying that I found it unpleasant to watch. There were other aspects of the film that were entertaining, but the misogyny is center stage. I suppose you could say it is made up for with the wiener sandwich in the end, which, yes, is as gruesome as it sounds. On the bright side though, the acting is entertaining, and there's a lot of female nudity, ha, if you like 70's carpet (which I really don't, ha; the modern look has spoiled me).

The film gets a pretty cool DVD presentation here, despite the fact that the cover art has nothing to do with this flick, really. Released by Troma, there's a lot of Troma Studios focused bonus features. They are pretty entertaining in the Troma style, but they aren't really about this particular film. There's also a small still gallery of the fake-o cover art. But, more to the disc's credit, there is the thorough, fanatical audio-commentary from Roth, as well as an intro by Lloyd Kaufman of Troma, interviews with some of the actors, and the theatrical trailer. It's a fine DVD for fans of the film, though frankly, while I found a few things in it entertaining, I'm not going to go around recommending this one. The bulk of it was just not for me.",1313539200,,3190,4.379426644182125
769313,1,6304045425,"As an avid B-movie collector, I have known about ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" for years, and have spent those years consciously avoiding it. Recently I received is as a Christmas present and could no longer run from it, so I got it over with. It turns out that my apprehension was well-placed, though not for all the correct reasons. The Troma packaging features lots of extras, most of which are fairly bland and boring (especially the ""Interactive Tour of Troma"" and the ""Troma Public Service Announcements,"") but the only one I was actually interested in, the audio commentary by special effects guru Eli Roth, didn't work correctly on my copy. I was actually somewhat relieved, as I didn't truly wish to sit through the film a second time, even though the commentary would definitely have been the most interesting thing on the disc. The film was made by Joel M. Reed in 1975, and apparently there are no truly good copies of the print remaining, as the transfer is terrible, and the sound quality is very inconsistent. Looking for things to like about the film I could only think of one: Sardu's black cat is perfect in his role.

The plot concerns the amoral Sardu (Seamus O'Brien) and his diminutive and quite insane assistant Ralphus (Louis DeJesus) who run a ""theatre of the macabre,"" wherein his brainwashed, caged, white slavery victims are tortured and killed (""Our next trick...dismemberment!"") The show is off-off-off-off-Broadway, but still attracts an audience which includes a film critic Creasy Silo (Alan Dellay,) who is justifiably unimpressed with the show and pointedly refuses to review Sardu's show (much to his later regret.) Also in attendance are a football player and his ballerina girlfriend who find the show fascinating. While the special effects are of the extremely unbelievable variety (especially the ""ballet shoes"" scene) and the acting is reprehensibly bad (O'Brien makes William Shatner look positively nuanced, understated, and demure by comparison,) this is just a nasty film. Others have commented that it's a satire of popular culture (or any of several hundred other interpretations,) but in reality it's just a squalid little piece of trash designed to shock and disgust. For me it didn't trigger shock and disgust as much as it triggered boredom and annoyance.

Sardu and Ralphus capture the ballerina, Natasha D'Natalie (Viju Krem,) and immediately begin brainwashing and tormenting her, as she is to be the star of his next show that combines ballet and sadism; I will give Reed points for originality on that genre-breaking directorial direction. My favorite part of the movie (favorite being a relative term) was the ""musical torture"" scene where they try to break D'Natalie's spirit with some of the worst music this side of John Cage's experimental Harpsichord works. Unfortunately, these aren't the only foul notes in the film, as the soundtrack features wheezy synthesizer tones and annoyingly inappropriate ragtime piano music throughout. As the plot unfolds, we meet the worst cop ever, watch the worst backgammon game in history, see the most unlikely case of Stockholm syndrome ever captured on film, see a doctor have a drink (don't even ask about this one,) learn about white slavery, and conclude with the five most annoying minutes of movie stock ever shot.

Many have warned potential viewers away from this movie because of its violence and gruesomeness. I certainly don't dispute those objections, though they aren't my main objections. Better reasons to ignore this movie are due to the fact that it's terribly made, badly written, and features some of the worst acting I have ever seen, it's overtly sadistic, completely misogynistic, boringly repetitive (if you've seen one fake amputation, you've seen 'em all,) and is in the end utterly pointless. It's a strictly amoral affair that features plot developments that don't make any sense and don't collectively offer a theme, lesson, or moral to the story. In short, the best reason to avoid the film is that it offers nothing but badly-acted mayhem and poorly-executed gore.

Let's just call it what it is: worst Christmas present ever.",1299801600,6,4147,5.121122599704579
769314,5,6304045425,"I first heard of this film as a freshman in HS English class.
The teacher described a night of drinking and possibly 'smoking'
then seeing this film. She described the straw scene.

Within 2 years of graduation, my best friend called and said: ""We have to go to the midnight movie and see this: the title alone makes it worth it!""

We went. It was truly cheesy fun, and reached cult status in years to come. It precedes
many of the current attempts at gore, but does it with a Catskills sense of humor.

THE DVD

The over-the-top analysis of the movie with symbolism explored in depth, reminded me of attending film school, so much was made of minutia. The film is not for everyone, but then again, those who hate THIS movie, probably watch Jennifer Anniston or Disney pictures and enjoy them. I find those two latter categories more tortuous to watch.

The sad fact many of the actors died shorty after the movie was made, prevented a sequel. I'd enjoy a big name update, however.

A large crate is then opened and a pulley chain is attached to its mysterious content which is then slowly hoisted into view, .. . to reveal that it is a living human female,thoroughly nude and very voluptuously formed!!  Then the show transpires!!
The setting is the Theater Macabre in which the resplendant yet deranged Master Sardu waxes philosophically from the stage to the seedy looking spectators on ""Delving into our grossest fantasies far beyond erotica!!"" in introduction to literally threadbare ( in reference to both the stage and the ""performing"" subjects ) exhibitions ( ""Sheer drama!!"" as Sardu calls them ) in which numerous thoroughly nude, very voluptuously formed and prodigiously endowed women of all colors and castes ( accrued through an illicit global white slavery network to which he is pluged in and where the living human cargo is literally packaged & shipped in crates ) are tortured and mutilated in spectacular and divers fashion ( more on that anon ) - gleefully administered by Sardue's sadistic eyeball eating dwarf sidekick Ralphus ( who also tells gestapo and inquisition jokes ) and aided by a duo of beautiful whip-weilding henchwomen clad in scanty dominatrix costumes,one of leather and the other of fur!  Others, mentioned as ""untrainables"", are methodically turned into bestial cannibal women by being caged, starved for a protracted period and occasionally fed a diet of raw meat for the purpose of disposing of potential troublemakers ( including a crooked wisecracking sleazball police inspector who knows of his illicit backstage dealings and blackmails him for a cut of the profits ). Despite the felonious nature of his shows and means of accruing their featured ""performers"", the mad showman has insane aspirations of transcending the shadowy underground, to which he has long been relegated, and going  Broadway( !!!! ) with a projected extravaganza featuring, in staring roles, a famous ballerina abducted from New York's prestigious Lincoln Center of Performing Arts ( ""Ballerina Flips For Freakshow!!"" declares a featured headline ) and a pompous critic ( similarly shanghied from a museum while admiring a mounted piece of subjective painting ""Now I find this artist makes a very interesting statement!"" ) who'd taken a very disparaging view of Sardu's stagecraft ( ""HA!! I've seen better, YEARS ago, at the Grande Guignol in Paris!"" ) and in which the latter is literally kicked to death by the former!

Production values and acting quality are low, yet raw sick diseased imagination absolutely flourishes and abounds with a touch of truly demented humor!!  The carnage is HIGH, and virtually non-stop!! .. in such incesant abundance that the whole movie is like a virtual parade of torture and carnage by means most extensive and varied, . ..including flagellation, electrocution, exhaustion, dismemberment, force feeding, decapitation, even classical medievel methods like the rack and iron turniquit!!
SEE numerous naked, voluptuously formed and prodigiously endowed damnsels leashed, lashed, brained, crushed, sawed, beheaded,.. even used as furniture or as stakes in a casual game of backgamon!!  SEE teeth extracted, eyeballs plucked, ears chewd off, nipples clamped by electrodes, hearts riped out!!  THRILL as a  girl, clad in leotards and slippers, has her feet sawed off!! .. a nude woman is forced to serve as a dining table while hot candlewax melts on her!!.. a male victim is braind with a sledgehammer instantly upon which blood spews from his mouth like water from a whales blowhole and, for extra good measure, theres even a bit of gay necrophilia and a penis sandwich ( yes a penis sandwich!! It's the closing image in fact )!!!
Then there is the SHOWSTOPER!! .. The piece de resistance so to speak!! .. In which the most depraved character of all ( and thats saying a GREAT deal HERE ) shaves a womans head, while humming an opera tune, drills a hole in her barren dome, inserts a straw and ssssssssslllllllllluuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrpppppppppppp .. !!! Not only does this characters dissplay upstage everything else in this film but, more incredibly still, even manages to disgust both Sardu and Ralphus ( !!!! ), . .. so much so that they decide to feed the sicko supremo to the caged cannibal women!!
The acting is terrible!  But of course, as the said critic of the story so eloquently puts it, ""No true actor would submit to engage in such trash!""
  The special effects are also substandard ( with  the peculiar exception of the head drilling / brain slurping scene which is uncharacteristically well done and convincing. They obviously got a professional to work on THAT one ) - a defect which is magnified by the tasteless close-ups.  This film, you see,  insists on being tastelessly graphic in depicting it's featured gore, despite the shodiness the majority of it's effects,.. and this approach only has the effect of enhancing their phonyness, especially with respect to dismemberment scenes.  Thus graphic close-up shots of hands being sawed off or peg legs being dragged across floors reveal false wooden limbs with red-painted stumps!  But hey, it's the IDEA that really counts here! And the ideas really ARE sick and at times quite outlandish ( even to the point of cartoonishness ) .. and SICK is, after all, the name of the game here!
As for the humor, it's occasionaly funny.  There is, again, a kind of burlesque spirit throughout the entire film and an occasional funny line of dialogue,.. such as when two inspectors are sneaking around in the dark and one finds a severed head at which he is visibly aghast and the other cracks ""Whats the matter ? .. never get a little HEAD before ?"" ( almost reminiscent of those sick cartoons in the really old issues of National Lampoon magazine ). And Ralphus the dwarf, who by the way also serves as gourmet cook, seems to have the funniest lines in the film, such as when he states his recipe for tasty fried chicken,.. ""The secret is in coocking it alive!"", or when Sardu imparts the old theatrical expresion of encouragement ""Break a leg Ralphus!"" and he replies ""Who's master ?!"". Ultimately, this is little more than an extended sick joke in the form of a feature length motion picture, .. so approach it with a sick sense of humor and it should pay off.",1289174400,4,6486,5.000927643784786

Much of this is due to the  performance of  Seamus O'Brien, who, as Sardu, delivers the sometimes surreal dialog completely straight faced. It is a shame this actor was killed by a burglar in his house early in his carreer, as I believe he could have been as great as Christopher Lee. The interaction with his assistant Ralphus (played by Luis De Jesus, who later found his way in the Star Wars universe as Ewok in Return of the Jedi) is very light-hearted, especially during some gruesome scenes of extreme horror. The music score also adds to a strange atmosphere by using very light themes during the heaviest scenes and rather disturbing sounds during rather comedic scenes but especially by not always using this technique, so that the viewer is constantly disoriented.
The production value of the film is enhanced by director Joel M. Reed's ingenious ways lighting, use of darkness and thus suggesting much more than there is without distracting from the story and the characters, but actually managing to add to the films atmosphere not in spite of, but because the limited budget. I very much doubt if the same wonderful result could be achieved, even today, over thirty years later, with a limitless budget and all the CGI effects in the world.

One of the worst, and funniest characters is the dwarf who reminds me of the guy from Hall and Oats. One of the funniest parts is when he bonks a girl as she tries to escape from a box as he's busy preparing shipments of white slave girls. It's just stupid on so many levels.

One reviewer said, ""This movie will appeal to any B-movie buff who can tolerate the extreme sex and violence."" What extreme sex? What extreme violence? This movie may have been gory and over the top in 1976, but compared to todays films, x-rated films included, it's laughable. There really is nothing extreme about it. There's plenty of sicker material out there.

I found the movie interesting, if you can get past the stupidity. It is a comedy, simply because there is no way you can take it seriously. I liked Seamus O'Brien's performance as Sardu. He certainly knew to play his roll with  tongue in cheek. Most of the camera work was okay, and the lighting was good for the most part. Some of the interior shots reminded me of old Hammer films.

769402,4,6304045425,"If you're going to proclaim yourself a true fan of cult cinema, particularly of the darkest kind, you really don't have a choice: you have to watch Blood Sucking Freaks (aka The Incredible Torture Show).  Yes, it can be hard to stomach - but, fortunately, there is only the one ballet scene that gets in the way of all the torture, cannibalism, and recidivist horror going on.  It's really pretty amazing that there are so many of us sick and perverted enough to watch something like this, but even I am not sure I would ever want to peep into the mind of Joel M. Reed, the writer/director who  actually had this idea and convinced others to help him bring it to cinematic life.

Down Soho way, you'll find a little hole-in-the-wall theatre advertising Sardu's Theatre of the Macabre.  It's a pretty good racket for Sardu (Seamus O'Brien) and his diminutive henchman Ralphus (Luis De Jesus): they basically have a license to kidnap, torture, and eat helpless young women just by honing their craft in front of an audience and calling it ""theatre.""  For its part, the crowd actually seems to revel in the sadistic brutality it witnesses, which is sort of disturbing in and of itself.  Well, not all of Sardu's customers appreciate his unique form of entertainment.  Not believing what he is seeing to be real, one local critic (Alphonso DeNoble) decries everything he sees on stage and refuses to review the show - that's a decision he'll live (or not) to regret.  Two other members of that same audience are also destined to return to the theatre, a pro quarterback and his famous dancer girlfriend (Viju Krem).  Sardu wants to put on a unique macabre ballet, and so he kidnaps his leading lady and tries to dominate her into doing his bidding.  He uses a lot of visual aids in the process, all of them involving young women undergoing torturous amounts of pain.  Meanwhile, Mr. Quarterback soon learns that New York's Finest weren't very fine at all back in the 1970s.

Of course, the actual plot of the film is secondary to the smorgasbord of twisted, disturbing, just plain wrong things that Sardu and Ralphus do on an almost continual basis.  They use both emotional and extremely physical means to control their victims, and it's completely over the top and oftentimes quite disgusting.  It's so extreme, especially in the film's infamous ""doctor"" scene, that I wonder how in the world they actually secured a release for this film back in the mid-1970s.  (One thing they were not able to secure was an actual rating by the MPAA, thanks to protests from the group Women Against Pornography.)  If it were released in theatres today (where it would be hard pressed to get even an NC-17 rating), Blood Sucking Freaks would still be met with large-scale protests.  Even a simple game of backgammon becomes an exercise in sadistic torture in Sardu's world.

Of course, the film has lost some of its shock value over the years, largely because all of the gore is so obviously fake.  In terms of audacity (which is basically all the film has going for it), though, Blood Sucking Freaks is as powerful and shocking as ever.  That is why it remains such an infamous cult classic permanently ensconced on the short list of the most offensive movies ever made.  The scads of female nudity in this film hardly even register as the infamous Sardu takes his personal theatre of the macabre far beyond erotica.  It's as if all the acid ingested by the hippie culture of the 1960s resulted in one really bad mid-1970s trip full of sadomasochism, full frontal female nudity, disturbing acts of torture (racks, dismemberment, decapitation, etc.), and all-around misogyny.  Blood Sucking Freaks more than lives up to its reputation, and that is why I am giving it four stars (I can't in good conscience give such a bad movie the coveted five stars).  It's not a movie I want to watch again any time soon, and those who are faint of heart or weak of stomach would do well to steer clear of it altogether.",1193702400,,3989,4.705035971223022

The plot becomes more ""involving"" and ""elaborate"" when Creasy Silo (a critic of Sardu's theatre) and the ballerina Natasha DeNatalie is kidnapped. Natasha's boyfriend Tom Maverick hires a corrupt policeman, the half-mafioso Detective Tucci (""Capisce?""), to find Natasha. And the fates of these persons entwine....
(""SPOILERS"" END HERE)

Many people giving this movie a 1-star rating seems to be missing the point completely. The film is obviously trash, so why take it any seriously? This is exactly the mistake many make by criticizing the lousy acting, the total absence of a believable plot, the over-the-top fake gore and the mysagonistic torture scenes. No aspect whatsoever of the movie can be taken seriously; the acting is so parodical, the cinematography so clumsy, the plot so simple, the gore so amateurishly fake and the torture scenes so unconvincing it seems obvious to me that ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" was intended as a comedy. Indeed, this should surprise no one, since comedy usually is an important aspect of any trash film (just think of, for example, John Waters' ""Pink Flamingos"", another classic bad taste film). To me, even the torture scenes were hilarious, mostly because of their totally unconvincing nature, the hilarious dwarf Ralphus and the delightfully cheesy gore effects(except, perhaps, the scene where the doctor pulls a girl's teeth out and sucks some of her brains through a straw; she actually managed to feign anxiety and pain a tad). My point is that it's meaningless to take a movie so clearly without pretentions as this one seriosly.

Thus, it is crucial that one accepts the premises of this movie in order to enjoy it; namely, as a bad taste/trash/exploitation-comedy film where everything that is considered essential components of good cinema elsewhere (like convincing acting and plot, a complementary cast, effective cinematography etc.) is intentionally reversed, ignoring the norms usually held sacred in Hollywood productions. And if one first accepts those premises, the movie becomes utterly enjoyable. There isn't one scene where bad acting doesn't occur, the girls are so unconvincing that even exploitative torture becomes comical and the interaction of Ralphus (you got to love him - he is indispensable in putting in the crucial ""freak show""-aspect that makes ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" what it is) and his master Sardu is classic in its own right.

This has to be the funniest exploitation/horror-movie ever made, and perhaps one of the most graphic as far as comedies are concerned. I can't recall ever having laughed so much during a horror film (perhaps except from ""Bad Taste""). If you genuinely enjoy bad taste, graphic trash, exploitation, gory horror-comedies and over-the-top crappy acting in general (which some reviewers claim to do despite rejecting ""Bloodsucking Freaks""), there shouldn't be any reason why you shouldn't find ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" a feast of a putrid pudding.",1152144000,6,3876,5.391089108910891

Sickening, misgynistic and sleazy trash flick written and directed by Joel Reed and released by the infamous and popular independent studio known as Troma. This movie is guaranteed to make you feel nauseated, when it was released in 1975 in theaters even with an ""X"" rating it was protested as a woman hating piece of filfth as they could be right, the film has became a midnight cult favorite and made alot of people back then and still today sick. The gore is over the top like a woman getting her skull drilled and her brain sucked out through a straw by a mad cannibal doctor and there's full frontal female nudity, torture, cannibalism and S&M as well.

769492,1,6304045425,"Blood Sucking Freaks (Joel M. Reed, 1976)

There are some movies so monstrously awful that they become classics. Plan 9 from Outer Space is the obvious example. What baffles me, and has for as long as I've watched movies, is that some misguided fools seem to think these timeless examples of how not to make a film are wonderful, worthy of imitation. Unfortunately, Joel M. Reed, the writer and director of Blood Sucking Freaks, seems to have watched, and worshipped, all of them.

This insanely bad film focuses on Sardu (The Happy Hooker's Seamus O'Brien, who was murdered the year after this movie appeared), proprietor of an underground S&M club with a taste for murdering performers onstage and a lucrative side business in white slavery. The first half-hour or so of the film is straight exploitation; there's a good deal of full frontal nudity and buckets of fake blood. It seems someone belatedly realized the movie wouldn't get any distribution without a plot, though, and as an afterthought, they cooked one up-- Sardu wants to take his act to Broadway, and to do that, he needs two things: a big star and a good review. So he and his assistant Ralphus (the late-- he died of a heart attack at the age of thirty-six-- porn star and Ewok portrayer Luis deJesus) arrange to kidnap international ballet star Natasha d'Natalie (Viju Krem, who also met a rather untimely death-- a hunting accident in 1983, just as her softcore career was getting off the ground) and influential theater critic Creasy Silo (Alphonso DeNoble, who had recently appeared in Alice, Sweet Alice). Natasha's football-player boyfriend Tom (Niles McMaster, also of Alice, Sweet Alice) is understandably concerned, and teams up with an NYPD detective, John Tucci (When the Bough Breaks' Dan Fauci in his final screen role; he went into TV production after this), to find out what's happened to Natasha.

For all that, the plot is secondary. Or tertiary. Or some even smaller number. The movie is nothing more than a ninety-minute excuse for lots of the same full frontal nudity and buckets of blood from the first half-hour.  It's as if Joel M. Reed (who also wrote the script) simply thought of interesting ways to kill people, and then built a script that would showcase them, with everything else being completely unimportant.

Blood Sucking Freaks comes off as a horror comedy, but one that succeeds at neither goal; the jokes are incredibly dumb (though the movie does have a good deal of unintentional hilarity), and the ""horrific"" special effects are so obviously fake that nothing is raised in the viewer except a kind of charitable pity.

Even if you're a hardcore fan of Shriek of the Multilated, and want to see this to catch Jennifer Stock in one of her all-too-few movie roles, it's not worth it. *",1132704000,9,2790,4.850840336134453

769494,5,6304045425,"When it comes to B-movies, Bloodsucking Freaks is ranked right up there with the best of them. What more could you want from a film? It has sex, violence, lots of nudity, and a crazed afro-wearing midget. Don't let the title fool you though. This movie has nothing to do with vampires, in fact except for one great scene, there really isn't much bloodsucking at all. The scene I speak of is the 'doctor' and his 'operation'. A beautiful nude blonde is strapped to a chair. First the doc pulls all her teeth out with a pair of pliers (this is to ensure she doesn't bite). Then he shaves the top of her head, drills a hole through the center of her skull, inserts a tube and sucks out the blood and gray matter. Fascinating.

There are so many scenes in this movie it is difficult to describe them all. The spanking guillotine scene is a favorite of mine, espescially what the midget does with the head after he takes it out of the basket. The midget is one weird little dude, he has a craving for human eyes, always wins at backgammon (another great scene) and is a hell of a little cymbal player.

The plot for this flick is pretty simple. A weird dude operates an S&M torture show in New York. This is a front for his white slavery business. When he's not performing with his cast, he simply tortures whoever is available. He has a cage of cannibalistic wenches that he keeps locked up too. They are good for disposing of any unwanted snoops.

Even the cop who finally busts him gets eaten. There are no winners here, good guys and bad guys die alike. Well the cannibal women do get free and eat their master, so I guess that's good. The final scene before the 'THE END' pops up is hilarious. You'll never eat a hot dog again without thinking of 'Bloodsucking Freaks'.

They throw darts at women's rears. They kick women. They just torture and torture and torture naked women. And that's the entire story, give or take.
However, it's hard not to be entertained by this, wondering what kind of torture they will use next. Sardu is pretty funny, as is Ralphus. And I really liked the music.

He drones on endlessly about the ""genius"" of hack filmmaker Joel Reed. From listening to Roth talk, I have learned that this obscure sleazy exploitation film made by porn industry members in the `70s influenced the entire course of American culture. ""Boogie Nights"" and other `70s-era films are copying the wardrobe. The musical ""Stomp"" is a large-scale rip-off of a shot where a dwarf plays the cymbals (according to Roth they stole the ""choreography,"" which consists of marching in place while smashing cymbals together). When someone accidentally glances at the camera, Roth says that he's ""so confident in his performance that he's not afraid to address the camera."" A topless ballet dance is symbolic of the end of the Vietnam War. I am NOT exaggerating, folks; he actually says all this. I've only just scraped the surface of this bozo's pontificating. Listening to his commentary is like listening to a college film student drone on about the genius of people roller-skating down the street with buckets on their heads.

Many critics have claimed that it is plotless gore. I disaggree. Although it may not be complex, the plot is more coherent than many of todays releases..., well structured, and most importantly it works. The film also has the greatest ensemble of characters since ' Seinfeld '. Seamus O'Brian is fantastic as the poncy, yet maniacal Sardu. The makers of this film must have raided an off-off broadway shakespearian theatre company to aquire this thespian. Luis De'Jesus on the other hand is a terrible actor. He spends the entire movie either incredibly under-acting, or overacting( although incedentaly he later managed to land a role as an ewok extra in 'Return of the Jedi')like an idiot. Still , he is hilarious as Ralphus, and has the best lines in the movie.  The other character of note is Touchee the corrupt New York cop. The actor who plays him also plays a delivery man early in the film. BSF is also packed with enough violence , gore , and nudity to please any open-minded film fan.

Don't get me wrong, the gore is pretty durn outrageous, but to toss out the old cliche, ""It's all in good fun!""
One exceptional quality the film has is Reed's prolonged shots of the characters' expressions during torture sequences and the like, providing an almost emotional attachment to the film's many victims. And of course, the humor attached to such sequences makes it all the more sickly.

769896,5,6304045425,"This isn't your typical horror/gore movie.  It's definitely an acquired taste, and not everyone will like it.  It's clear why this film has become a cult classic.  Seamus O'Brien gives an amazingly solid performance, and  De Jesus does an amazing job with Ralphus.  I wouldn't recommend this to  the squemish, but if this fits your taste, it's a must have.",946425600,2,356,4.85
769897,5,6304045425,"Troma did right by buying the rights to this cult film.  The tongue in cheek campiness offsets the gruesome and anti-female violence.  The acting is subpar as expected however, Seamus O'Brien is a standout as the slightly  fey Master(it is unfortunate that his untimely murder after the release of  the film prevents a sequel). The wonderfully choreographed ballet/martial  arts sequence must not be missed for any avid dancer. Nor the scene  refering to the title of the film! The kidnap scene is a flash of  brilliance in makeup that even Tom Savini (Living Dead Movies) would envy.  In short, no reference to Ralphus, don't pass up an opportunity to see this  film! Remember to keep your key chain on the right!",945734400,14,714,4.8347107438016526
769898,1,6304045425,"There are two ways to describe this movie.  A marathon in woman-hating; that's the first and only decent way to describe this movie. Completely lacking any redeeming qualities; totally expliotive.  It contains no  statement of any kind; it is not even nihilistic.  One could argue the  ending makes it a moral tale, but that ignores the other 99% which idolizes  the two main actors frolicking in blood and lust.  Told from a completely  male viewpoint, if this movie were told the other way around, with women  exploiting men in such a way, you would probably never have heard of it.  As for the story of the kidnapped girl, it barely exists; her story is  overwhelmed with the spectacle of torture and gore.  The other way to  describe this movie is as an exercise in male perversion.  If you're a man  into necrophilia, blood, gore, torture, and sick humor, and you enjoy  watching naked women being sliced, diced, chopped, whipped, drilled, and  having their brains sucked out, then this is your kind of movie.  If you  like this movie, you might also like the movies the Nazis made in  Auschwitz.  You also might like to see a psychiatrist (psychiatrists are  fun people, they will understand).  I rate this movie a 1: worthy of one  watch (then just try to forget it).",932083200,5,1274,4.6863636363636365

I'm surprised that nobody cites the cruelest and most violently pornographic scene, where a woman is placed into in a guillotine, rope forced into her mouth, the rope connected to the guillotine blade that will drop on her if she screams.  Then the dwarf canes her naked bum from behind, until she...screams.  Head falls into basket;l dwarf picks it up and moans pleasurably as the severed head gives him ""head.""  No, I didn't believe it either.  It's a big, wild, wonderful world we live in.",1498608000,,592,4.653846153846154

7860274,4,6304045425,"I don't want to dig too deep into Bloodsucking Freaks' plot in full right now, but I'll say it's one of the most deplorable Horror-Exploitation films ever made in the mid 1970's. And I love it. But this remaster, the first time in Widescreen HD, is a lost opportunity for a proper video restoration, with many scratches, huge blemishes & film damage throughout the entire film.

Various other female sex slaves get electrocuted, dismembered, flogged, decapitated, and one woman has her bare butt used as a human dart board by Sardu and Ralphus. Probably the first and only time I've ever seen a friendly game of butt darts in a movie. This ones a keeper.",1442620800,,494,4.625
