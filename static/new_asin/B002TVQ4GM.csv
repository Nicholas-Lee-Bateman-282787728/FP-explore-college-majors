3986239,4,B002TVQ4GM,"Though it's very light on actual westerns, this is a must for Hill/Spencer fans as it's the only way to see many of these films letterboxed, uncut and in English. Plus the quality is better than usual for Videoasia, even if it's the usual ""4 movies per disc"" routine we're used to. NOBODY IS THE GREATEST (aka A GENIUS, TWO FRIENDS AND A DUPE, the onscreen title) is the full Euro cut in scope, and LITTLA RITA OF THE WEST is presented in its uncut European version, in scope, with all the musical numbers intact, and the English dub finally included (with the songs still in Italian, of course). Forget the overpriced, VHS-sourced garbage DVDs of these two titles released by ""Televista"" also for sale; this is definitely a better value. Also included are Bud Spencer's entertaining cop films, FLATFOOT, FLATFOOT IN HONG KONG, FLATFOOT ON THE NILE and FLATFOOT IN AFRICA, all letterboxed and in English (I'm assuming sourced from the Italian DVDs, which weren't English friendly). Then you get the Hill/Spencer team ups, ALL THE WAY BOYS (in scope but, like the Wham! disc, still the 90-minute reissue cut instead of the 105-minute one released on US tape), and I'M FOR THE HIPPOPOTAMUS in a widescreen version that, again, is more pleasing than the crud from Televista. Not bad at all for $17, and definitely cheaper than shelling out for the import discs of each title.",1267401600,25,1372,4.76890756302521
3986240,1,B002TVQ4GM,The cover of this set specifically shows the two stars in a western together.  There are no westerns with them together and 8 out of 10 of the movies are not westerns.  This set is garbage and not even worth the 15 bucks it costs for the 10 movies.,1267228800,2,248,4.040816326530612
8380695,5,B002TVQ4GM,Excellent service and product; great addition to the Hill/Spencer collection! will buy again!,1409011200,,93,6.230769230769231
8380696,4,B002TVQ4GM,"This set is a wonderful collection of Terence Hill's and Bud Spencer's classics. Some are them together and others their soloe films. The collection includes Nobody's the Greatest (a.k.a. A Genius two partners and a dupe.),Little Rita of the west,Renegade,All the way boy's and much more. It is the greatest set ever,filled with slapstick.",1333756800,,339,5.296296296296297
8380697,5,B002TVQ4GM,I love this movie pack it has a lot of funny parts that will keep you laughing for hours. Thanks,1301529600,,96,3.85
8380698,2,B002TVQ4GM,"This was not what I was expecting. It wasn't as funny as any of the westerns. Nobody is my name for example. Very disappointed, not with deliver or anything just the content of the video itself.",1297641600,,194,4.416666666666667
8380699,1,B002TVQ4GM,No westerns here - and poor quality. Also does not contain 10 films as advertised. How do folks get away with advertising things like this?,1293235200,,139,4.6
8380700,3,B002TVQ4GM,I got this a Christmas Gift and I haven't really watched it but It doesn't appear to be what I thought.  It doesn't look like it is a western.  I won't know for sure until Christmas but I am a little dissappointed with it.  It says Western but when I look at the back it looks like there are episodes that are not western.,1289865600,,322,4.0
8380701,5,B002TVQ4GM,"I have been a fan of these spaghetti westerns since I was a teen and when I found this pack for the price they were asking on Amazon.com, I could not pass it up. They still are a good watch on a Saturday movie night.",1282435200,,216,3.8222222222222224
8380702,2,B002TVQ4GM,"I grew up watching the various Trinity movies and was so excited when I saw This DVD set for sale.  Turns out that there are only 2 westerns out of the 10 movies on the DVD.  It may not be a big deal if you are a huge Bud Spencer and Terence Hill fan but to market this as a ""Spaghetti Western Bible"" and having the guys in their traditional western garb on the cover, gives you the idea that this is a DVD set of westerns when it's not.  I was very disappointed to only see two obscure westerns versus getting a nice collection of Trinity movies.",1278633600,3,547,4.046296296296297
8380703,5,B002TVQ4GM,"Hi, I do not know what you guy's are talking about! I loved the whole set, every one of them! They are so funny, and great to watch over, and over again! The quailty of the film is not that bad for the older movies what do you expect! The only trouble I had was how skinny some of the movies was! But, I loved them all, and it is a great set to watch! SO what if they where not all western's, they were great! I would Highly recommend people to buy this set!! I am a Trinity fan, and a western fan!! I really Loved the whole set!",1273708800,8,529,3.8181818181818183
8380704,4,B002TVQ4GM,"I agree with Nathaniel M. Thompson that this set is well worth the money. Just not as a ""Spaghetti Western Bible"". The prints are very, very good on all these films and certainly better than any releases by this company so far. Anybody expecting all Spaghetti Westerns will no doubt be disappointed but as a Hill/Spencer collection this is the best I've ever seen. And I've seen/bought a lot. I do wish they had included Spencer's ""It Can Be Done, Amigo"" in the same quality, but hey... I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the misleading title of this set.",1267833600,7,555,4.450980392156863
