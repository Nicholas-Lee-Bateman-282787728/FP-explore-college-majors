7203793,5,B00XZ1JO2Q,"I love Don Johnson. Nash Bridges is for me the best thing he ever did. While ""Miami Vice"" was great, ""Nash Bridges"" tops it. The humor is ever present with Cheech Marin, as Joe, Nash's side kick. They get into all kinds of adventures with back stories that are consistent through all six years. There's usually a shoot out. Nash drives a 1971 Barracuda. There are a lot of shots in the Cuda traveling to the crime scene. I thought the sixth season might not have held up as well and that's why it was canceled. Not so. It's great.",1456790400,4,530,4.31

7203798,5,B00XZ1JO2Q,The ONLY negative thing I have to say about this is they ended the show too soon. Another 5 or 6 seasons would have been great!,1453852800,,127,3.923076923076923

7203802,4,B00XZ1JO2Q,"Buying the Sixth Season completes the whole Seasons that i have bought and watched  so far of Nash Bridges. I have enjoyed all the six seasons very much. Looking back, it would have been great to have kept going with more shows,as i thought that more stories could have been told and more of the characters stories could have developed further as well. But i guess you've got to call it a day at some stage. The only minor problem i had watching the Sixth Season was the video quality was not as good as it could have been. I was picking up resolution lines that appeared randomly throughout the shows. This might have been due to the fact that the production is sold as an NTSC Region 1. My Dvd player is a multi region player, but runs on a PAL system. That well could have been the cause of the loss in video quality. Loose one star for that. Thanks to the actors and the production team, as the whole six seasons were very enjoyable and entertaining for me.",1471046400,,961,4.30939226519337

7203810,4,B00XZ1JO2Q,"The quality of the transfer is a little grainy.  All that aside, it's still Don Johnson and Cheech Marin solving crimes in San Francisco.  It was entertaining to watch them 15 years ago and it still is entertaining today.",1457568000,,221,4.641025641025641

8717103,1,B00XZ1JO2Q,"I give it a 1 star rating because I could not rate it zero. I'm sure the Sixth Season is probably good like the first five seasons were, but the Blu-ray disc I received would not play on my Blu-ray player. I had to send it back. So I'm still waiting to see the Sixth Season. I'll probably wait until I can just get it on a standard DVD.",1492387200,,336,3.8840579710144927
