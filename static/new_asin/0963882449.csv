7793713,5,0963882449,"We've been searching off and on for years for this! The animation is rather in the style of Terry Gilliam, and the wonderful script is delivered with impeccable timing, and in a unique way. We watch it often. Thank you Ms. Thomson, well done! Whether you love or hate opera, we think you'll love this.",1361232000,,301,4.490909090909091
7793714,4,0963882449,"This is a good resource for people who are new to opera and a good laugh for anyone!  It is especially helpful if you want to sound like you know a lot about opera without having to go to one.  Of course, after you watch,  you'll probably want to see them all!  A friend gave this video to me for  my birthday.  It makes a great gift!",950400000,7,334,3.91044776119403
