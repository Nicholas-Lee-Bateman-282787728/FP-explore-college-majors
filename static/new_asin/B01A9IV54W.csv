7595392,5,B01A9IV54W,"I have been a lover of Agatha Christie for as long as my addled brain can recall, with 'And Then There Were None' being my top pick for favorite mystery novel in the history of the genre. From the moment I learned about this adaptation, to the final throat-tighetning minutes of the last episode, my body was humming with excitement. In the past, I have seen only Ren&eacute; Clair's 1945 film of the same name, and none of the stage plays. There were a few films and TV episodes loosely based on this- Agatha Christie's most recognizable work, but they bear no merit here. Now, fans of Christie's classic 'locked-room' mystery have been gifted a faithful adaptation to drool over.

Keeping the 1930's time period, but gorgeously filmed with modern camerawork and style, the story here is of ten strangers invited to a secluded island mansion by their mysterious host(s). Upon their arrival, they are each accused of murder in one way or another. Eventually, one by one, they start to die. Cut off from the mainland, stranded with a killer(s), their numbers dwindling, the past for each begins to rear its ugly head.

This is probably one of the most fascinating whodunnits ever written/staged/produced, and -in keeping with the book's original bleak ending- one of the darkest. BBC1 has generated something truly exquisite. Watching the three, one-hour-long episodes of 'And Then There Were None' was like a dream; I honestly don't remember blinking once, or even taking a single breath throughout my binge-watching. It's that good. The suspense will keep you rapt, the mystery will keep you guessing, and the brilliant performances of a stellar cast will keep you wanting more.

When you find something you love, you want to share it with the world. That is why, as soon as the US releases its DVD version in April, I will be parading 'And Then There Were None' around to everyone I know; I will shout its greatness from every rooftop of every corner of the world until everyone knows my love of it.

My only question is: What are you waiting for?",1453766400,140,2049,4.779661016949152
7595393,5,B01A9IV54W,"By far the best adaption of Christie's book yet. It really can't get any better. Read the novel as a nine year old and it got me started on my love of mysteries. Have reread it several times over the years. Seen most of the movie adaptions. the first done in 1945 is the best of them until now. Dark bleak and haunting just like it should be. The cast is top notch. Enjoyed the back story's of all the victims, it even fleshed them out more than in the book, one change that might upset purists, but it suited the film well. Highly recommended.",1453680000,11,544,4.190476190476191
7595394,5,B01A9IV54W,"This is what the BBC is oft acclaimed for getting so right  a period drama adaptation and add to that the fact it is based on an Agatha Christie novel  - that is now too un PC to mention  it was been made before as Ten Little Indians in 1965 and that is worth checking out too.
Plot spoilers ahead
The plot is that eight people all receive invites appealing to them to join their host on an island off the Devon coast  Soldier Island. Once they all arrive they are greeted by a married couple from below stairs who are their servants. Then at an appointed time a record player starts to play and one by one they are all accused of murder as if being indicted in a court. Then the fun begins as their fates are dictated by the childrens rhyme of, in this case, the one by one disappearance of the ten little soldiers.

This has fantastic period detail and a fabulous art deco house that the fun is set in. The acting is all perfectly done in what is a masterpiece of casting. It is done in three one hour long episodes and it is all brilliantly addictive. Great fun, well made and perfectly executed (as indeed are a few cast members) this is one that is ridiculously easy to recommend.",1452902400,33,1185,4.225663716814159
7595395,5,B01A9IV54W,"Ten people are called to a remote island, with a luxurious mansion set on it. One by one, they are murdered for their past crimes-- and they have no idea who the one hunting them is.

That chilling premise is all there is of ""And Then There Were None,"" based on Agatha Christie's classic novel that completely subverted all ideas of what a murder mystery was like. There's no detectives. No innocent people. No clues. And the adaptation is a glorious piece of work with a top-notch cast, insidiously sinking the almost uniformly unsympathetic characters into a cold, clammy mire of paranoia and terror, before blindsiding the audience with (imagine that) Christie's original shocking ending.

The year is 1939, with World War II looming on the grey horizon. Eight strangers are called to the remote Soldier Island, including a former governess (Maeve Dermody), a callous soldier of fortune (Aidan Turner), an elderly judge (Charles Dance), an alcoholic doctor (Toby Stephens), and so on. Two servants -- who seem to have their own skeletons in the closet -- are already waiting in the mansion to serve them. All were summoned here for various reasons by the mysterious Mr. and Mrs. U. N. Owens (GET IT?), who are oddly absent during the first night's dinner...

... and we soon learn why, as a recorded message addresses them all, and lists the murders they have committed. Each one is a killer, ranging from vehicular manslaughter to the murder of African tribesman, from drowning a child to condemning an innocent man to death. And though some deny it, brief flashbacks reveal they are all guilty... and they have not been punished.

And almost immediately, people start dying in the same way as the ""Ten Little Soldier Boys"" poem, which is posted in every bedroom. With every death, one of the ten jade figurines on the table goes missing. With no way on or off the island, the rapidly-dwindling group realizes that one of them is the murderer -- and soon paranoia, suspicions and even madness begin to afflict them. Who is the person who is punishing them all, and can they figure out his or her identity before all of them are dead?

It's a very difficult thing to adapt a murder mystery which unfolds without the help of a detective, and which has a complete lack of ""good guys."" So it's a credit to the people who created this miniseries that they carried off one of Christie's most spellbindingly creepy stories, without bowdlerizing the story with some innocent characters or a less bleak finale. It has all the darkness, the nameless horror that is at the core of every Christie story, along with her knowledge of the evil in human hearts.

And the haunting, creeping paranoia of the story takes hold gradually, reflected in the way it's filmed. At first the island is sunny and lush, with a beautiful mansion; but as the story unfolds the light grows colder and dimmer, and the mansion seems full of shadows and distorted images. There are feverish coke parties, screaming arguments, and nightmarish visions of dead people awaiting the deaths of their killers. When things finally explode into violence, there's a haunting, numb quality to the scenes that follow.

And sprinkled throughout it are brief glimpses of the past, showing what these people did and why -- most of them are dedicated to Vera's story, but each one is shown at least briefly. The biggest problem? Blore's crimes (corruption, perjury and the condemnation of an innocent man) are inexplicably changed to beating a gay man to death for... no explained reason. Perhaps the original crime wasn't ""shocking"" enough, or they deemed it too complex to sum up in a ten-second flashback.

It also has a top-notch cast here, with nobody really turning in a bad performance. Dermody's Vera is apparently the main character (since her crime is given the most attention) and the story deteriorates as she does, turning from a respectable, well-groomed young woman into a wild-eyed, hallucinating mess. Your first instinct is to feel sorry for her, but gradually you see what a cold, selfish person she is. On the other hand, Turner gives an outstanding performance as an icily amoral man who feels no shame about killing over twenty people, yet is still the safest, sanest person the island.

As for the rest of the cast, Stephens does equally well as a doctor who scoffs at women's ""nerves,"" but quickly unravels under the threat of death; Dance is all grandfatherly concern and calm; and Burn Gorman, Richardson and Anna Maxwell Martin do good jobs as a crooked cop who realizes his errors too late, a cold-hearted religious fanatic, and a nervous maidservant. Only Sam Neill's guilt-ridden soldier elicits true sympathy, since his was a crime of passion, and he clearly feels real guilt and sorrow over it.

Despite a few questionable choices, ""And Then There Were None"" keeps the spirit and style of Christie's classic mystery alive, winding a damp, icy web around the viewer as it moves to the inevitable conclusion. Sublimely creepy and haunting.",1452124800,79,5022,4.876905041031653
7595396,2,B01A9IV54W,Not the best BBC production. I gave 2 stars because the actors were grade A.,1533513600,,76,4.133333333333334

7595399,4,B01A9IV54W,Too much foul language but overall I liked this retelling. I found the original black & white movie to be more scary but the endings are completely different. This one was more realistic.,1532390400,,187,4.696969696969697
7595400,1,B01A9IV54W,The book is iconic though dark with some shockingly deplorable characters.  But why does the adaptation have to have F bombs and sex scenes?  Yuck.,1532044800,,147,4.84
7595401,5,B01A9IV54W,Brilliant retelling of an old treasure. But you knew you would get a good show with this lineup of actors.,1531785600,,106,4.35
7595402,5,B01A9IV54W,"I loved this! It deviates from the book in some parts but I still think it really works - in all honesty books are not always best translated directly to tv/movies! The actors really bring the characters to life. The costumes, sets, and filming locations really transport the viewer. I definitely recommend this miniseries. Very well done!",1530403200,,339,4.964912280701754
7595403,4,B01A9IV54W,"I show this to my high school classroom after we read the book. It is a bit boring in places and the students seem to lose interest, but it's also fairly gory which keeps the kids interested. It is somewhat mature, we had to have parent permission to show it. There's two sex scenes we skipped over, so if you're a teacher like me, please keep that in mind. One more scene where there's some heavy petting. The deaths are pretty gory. Depending on your teaching style, this may not be the movie to show your kids.
As an adult that just loves the Agatha Christie novel, it's great. Clever and fairly accurate adaptation of the book. I really like the way they made changes, but gave homage to the novel. If you like the book, I'd definitely watch this. Also, I appreciate how hot Phillip Lombard was compared to my mundane imagination of him. He's shirtless in a scene. It's worth it.",1530403200,,883,4.423312883435583
7595404,2,B01A9IV54W,With such a talented cast this production was very disappointing. The characters are ill-defined and you get the sense that you are watching a mediocre television production from beginning to end. The house and the island had all the appearance of a cheaply made production so you would expect interesting dialogue and character development. There is neither. There is no sense of foreboding and the characters are shown to be guilty of their crimes from the start creating no sense of tension. Hard to believe but I think Charles Dance was the worst from beginning to end. And where did the gratuitous sex scene come in? In politically correct fashion the Butler is turned into a domestic abuser and the police officer has issues with homosexuality. Spare me... The production is based on Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. And it was based pretty poorly. The worse part of all was probably the display of the 10 figurines which were bizarre and seemingly pointless to say the least.,1529798400,,993,4.881656804733728

7595412,3,B01A9IV54W,"""And Then There Were None"" is a 2015 BBC adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1939 novel of the same name. It originally aired in three parts for a total running time of 3 hours. This is a dreary, flat, and unattractive adaptation by screenwriter Sarah Phelps and director Craig Viverios. It begins with a heavy, ominous score and grey, drab visuals before anything has happened, out of line with the mood of the characters at that point. The score and visuals are sullen throughout, leaving no opportunity for any change in mood once someone dies, or the characters realize that they are being hunted, or as they begin to fear one another out of desperation. These people must be terrified, yet the film can build no suspense.

Eight guests of Mr. and Mrs. Owen travel to Soldier Island, invited under different pretexts: Vera Claythorne (Maeve Dermody), a schoolteacher, has taken employment as Mrs. Owen's secretary for the summer. Justice Lawrence Wargrave (Charles Dance) expects to meet a friend. Young Tony Marston (Douglas Booth) thinks there is a party. General John McArthur (Sam Neill) is to be interviewed by Mr. Owen, a military historian. Philip Lombard (Aiden Turner) is a soldier of fortune hired to ""handle situations"". Religious spinster Emily Brent (Miranda Richardson) expects Mrs. Owen to contribute to ""the education of girls of the lower order"". Dr. Edward Armstrong (Toby Stevens) has been asked to care for Mrs. Owen. ""Davis"" (Burn Gorman) is not who is says he is.

The guests are attended by Mrs. Ethel (Anna Maxwell Martin) and Mr. Thomas Rogers (Noah Taylor), the housekeeper and butler. In each bedroom, there is posted a copy of the nursery rhyme ""Ten Little Indians."" After dinner the first evening, a voice from the gramophone accuses each guest of being guilty of murder. Shortly thereafter, they begin to die, one by one.

Ethel and Thomas Rogers are overacted to the point of the grotesque. Some histories have been changed from the book to make the ""murders"" of which the guests are accused less ambiguous and more brutal. In the book, the accused were beyond the reach of criminal law, guilty of wrongdoing that resulted in someone dying but not literally of murder, leaving the reader in a moral quandary. Once the General dies, I found the culprit to be obvious. I read the book long ago, but I recall thinking that it was not possible to guess the identity of the murderer from the clues provided. Of course, the characters do foolish things to advance the story, like go off alone with a killer on the loose. But this adaptation never manages to evoke any mood except gloomy.",1526601600,,2612,4.852017937219731
7595413,5,B01A9IV54W,"I really can't say enough positive things about this adaptation!

Everything was just spot on - the cast, scenery, script, costuming - everything!

I am an Agatha purist - I realize that some of her work must be adapted in order to ensure it conveys well into the medium of film. It was lightly done in this film. The last chapters of the book were adapted into the movie so well.

And- THANK GOODNESS - no Jane Marple! (Why do they keep taking every AC novel and making into a ""Marple murder""? Ugh!)",1526428800,,500,4.354838709677419

7595420,4,B01A9IV54W,"Just got done watching this, and I was impressed.  In particular, the three hour running time allows for plenty of time to breathe before each murder--perhaps too much time, as it takes a looong time for the first episode to gain any steam.  However, we also get a great deal of insight into most of the characters, with the exception of the early victims. With the exception of Lombard, we get to see the crimes in a visceral way that we never really do in the book, and thus these 10 become less sympathetic as the miniseries goes on.  In particular, Vera and Blore come across as particularly monstrous--although Blore has a moment of sympathy near the end.

It is also fascinating to watch the mental breakdown of the characters accelerate with each victim, which makes the final episode a near classic.  However, there is one off-putting plot change--the drug/alcohol bacchanal by the later survivors, followed by a sexual encounter between two of the major characters.  I understand the significance of both, and it makes sense in terms of the plot, but it was a bit jarring.",1523664000,,1081,4.754010695187166

7595460,2,B01A9IV54W,"This is the most faithful adaptation that Ive seen-in addition to being the first made for TV, a point that is made in the extras at least 3 times-but the dullest: slow motion, long static shots of brooding Byronic characters, lethargic and leaden pacing, and ineffective music with a harmonic rhythm in a timeframe usually reserved for geologic eras. IMHO, the worst was the pointless scenes added to flesh out the characters that only served to stretch the running time of the three episodes. The most egregious example is the penultimate scene where the killer and the last character alive have a pointless chat. In the book Agatha Christie has the murderer explain their  actions, the how and the why it was done.

I would say it's worth watching, but not as a Christie mystery. The people are snappish and snide without any humor or likability.

7595494,5,B01A9IV54W,"While the adaptation is not 100% true to the novel, I understand why most of the changes were made. It was impossible for many of the backstories to be kept true to the original without having to insert lengthy supplemental material to fully explain the situations. This is especially true of Blore's backstory, which was changed to him killing a homosexual man out of a hatred for their kind rather than him condemning an innocent man to jail after being persuaded by a gang to commit perjury. The latter would have been difficult to portray in a film as it would be necessary to insert scenes of Blore coming to terms with the gang and committing the actual perjury, both of which are not the easiest situations to understand without context. By changing the story, all that needed to be done was to insert a couple of slurs and phrases of hate speech in his dialogue for us to understand the situation. I understand why this upsets those who would rather see an adaptation that sticks strictly to the story, but we must remember that being a different medium, films must sometimes make changes in order to portray the story without detracting from the main message. Overall the tone is very dark and the paranoia is very clearly seen in the characters as they slowly devolve into baser creatures.

7595510,1,B01A9IV54W,"Of the many film versions of this story, some were entitled ""Ten Little Indians"" (TLI) and others were entitled ""And Then There Were None"" (ATTWN). I have seen four of them, those issued in 1945 (ATTWN) (given 4 stars by Leonard Maltin), 1966 (TLI) (2.5 stars), 1975 (TLI) (1.5 stars) and 1989 (TLI) *a BOMB). There are others which I have not seen, but of those four, the 1945 movie is the only one which, in my opinion, rates discussion. The ending was changed, together with scenes supporting that change, but in all other material respects it is true to the book and is an excellent version.
  The BBC version (ATTWN) was issued in 2015. Some comments in the DVD's ""extras"" were these: It was to ""recreate 'And Then There Were None' as it was written in the book."" ""I was incredibly shocked by its brutality and felt that when I came to adapt it, it would absolutely be set in that place...and it's going to be brutal...."" (Sarah Phelps, Screenwriter) By the way, Sarah Phelps said that she had never read any of Agatha Christie's stories or books prior to this adaptation. ""...the ending that is in this particular adaptation is the one that was in the original book. So we're not talking about deviation from the original story very much if at all."" (Mathew Prichard, Agatha Christie's grandson)
  Despite the above wording, there are too many serious defects and significant differences from the book, and this version is a disaster. It is a virtual slasher movie, a horrible, bloody massacre, with blood and gore everywhere. Although screenwriter Sarah Phelps said the book was ""brutal,"" the book's ""brutality"" was only in the fact that ten people were killed. The book had no description of brutal, violent and bloody killings. The brutality was only in the BBC version, and that with a vengeance.
  A ridiculous difference from the book was the change from the ten Indians to ten soldiers. The book poem involved Indians, and the island was named Indian Island. The BBC changed the island to Soldier Island and the poem had soldiers instead of Indians. Why?
  A certain amount of backstory was necessary and helpful, but the BBC version carried this much too far, especially with respect to Vera Claythorne, parts of whose backstory popped up over and over and over again, ad nauseum. Especially ridiculous was the scene in which, when she returned to the house after having shot Lombard, leaving her the only one left on the island, she was greeted by a vision of the little boy she was supposed to have killed, the killing that brought her to the island.
  Getting back to the violence, the Rogers couple's backstory was described in the book with Dr. Armstrong telling Lombard that Rogers had said that the woman had a cardiac problem and from time to time needed amyl nitrate. Death would result if this were withheld. To withhold it involved ""no positive action...just negation."" The BBC showed Rogers putting a pillow over the old woman and smothering her with great violence. In another instance, when Rogers was killed while ""chopping up sticks,"" the BBC film had him found lying in a massive pool of blood. There were so many other instances of blood and violence, too many to detail.
  After the judge was shot, leaving only four people alive, the four had a drunken, orgy-like party, something definitely not in the book. Also, the methods of many of the deaths were different in the BBC production from those in the book. Throughout the BBC production the potential victims were yelling and screaming at one another, just too much noise. How do all these differences from the book reconcile with Mathew Prichard's statement that ""...we're not talking about deviation from the original story very much if at all?""
  In the book, after the police found the bodies, an Epilogue told of a manuscript subsequently being sent to Scotland Yard by the master of a fishing trawler who found it in a bottle which the judge had thrown into the water before his death. This detailed all that had occurred. The BBC version did contain a sort of summary by Mr. Owen (the killer) as he witnessed Vera Claythorne hanging herself, and with her bargaining for her life, another stupid difference from the book.
  The piece de resistance is the Russian film version (TLI). (Please see my subsequent note below) I agree with those reviewers who said it is definitely a Russian film, but that does not detract from its quality. Charlton Heston played a Mexican in ""Touch of Evil."" Eli Wallach played a Mexican in ""The Magnificent Seven"" (magnificent). Mickey Rooney played a Japanese in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (hilarious). The Russian film has English subtitles which, although not always idiomatic, are always thoroughly understandable. The backstories in the Russian film were enough to explain the situations of the individuals and no more.
  This version stuck closely to the book in every material detail. In fact, a substantial amount of the dialogue was taken directly from the book. With the death for which the Rodgers couple was accused, there was no violent smothering with a pillow. It was described exactly as stated in the book: the withholding of amyl nitrate needed for a cardiac condition, ""no positive action just negation!""
  There were a few differences between the Russian film and the book, but none were material and none changed or detracted from the story. After the third death, the doctor and the judge teamed up to find the killer. There was an elaborate scene to this effect in the 1945 movie (ATTWN). There was an Epilogue in the book which summarized all of the action, i.e., the manuscript in the bottle. The Russian film provided this as a ""voice over"" by Mr. Owen after all had been killed. This included a flashback showing the teaming up of the doctor and the judge as mentioned above. This was not done by the BBC. There was just the quick statement by Mr. Owen as he witnessed Vera Claythorne's hanging.
  The Russian film was made in 1989 and does not have the picture quality of a Blu-ray film, but its quality is certainly good enough. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I strongly recommend it as the one to have.
  ADDENDUM - My comments with reference to the Russian version applied to the movie as I viewed it on YouTube. I subsequently purchased a DVD of what I thought was the same movie and was sorely disappointed. This DVD was the same performance with the same actors, directors, etc. as the YouTube movie, but the English subtitles were written by someone else, someone who knew very little about the English language. Even more important, the title was change from ""Ten Little Indians"" to ""Ten Little N...."" The poem was changed and the island became Negro Island. I found this extremely offensive and, if you look at the DVDs available on Amazon, you will see that there are two DVDs of this version and both are now unavailable. The fact that they are unavailable is the best part of that version. However, the version on YouTube is still my favorite for the reasons stated above.",1490832000,10,7038,4.77841845140033

7595516,4,B01A9IV54W,"AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is the best adaptation of Agatha Christie's famed mystery novel.  I, personally, like most, had preferred the black-and-white Rene Clair version (1945) of same title.  A T T W N was remade in 1966 and 1975, sometimes titled ""Ten Little Indians"" to lesser critical acclaim or fan fare.
I will not dwell on the plot on this one since the easy majority know it and if you don't this version of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE will probably be even better if (you) don't know the plot twists!  Very suspenseful stuff.

So, check this out for the quotient of gore to appease the more 'modern' day film fan as well as some f-bombs, although this takes place on 'Soldier Island' just as WW2 is about to break out.  But, I guess Brits talked like that in the late 1930's too?
Anyways, the popular actors/actress in AND THEN THERE WERE NONE are Sam Neil, Miranda Richardson (she does the 'elitist' British upper class thing very well...) and Charles Dance looking very old as Judge Wargrave.
All the actors (especially Maeve Dermody as Vera Claythorne and Aidan Turner as Philip Lombard) hold there own - and then some - as each character with some shady past event must deal with the truth about their current, no-place-to-go situation.
My only mild complaint about this well filmed mustery (looks NOTHING like a stage play, I was relieved to see) is the running time of 55 minute episodes on each of the 2 discs.  This should Not have been a movie closer to three hours long than two hours.
I, also, had a bit of a problem with the final ""dialogue"" considering the position another character was in!  Again, I don't want to say too much because the film makers did a good job of recreating Agatha Christie's novel and the time period, while adding some some nicely needed 'character study' information; and I certainly do not wish to give away any ""different"" references from/away from the novel.
Good 4 star production of classic mystery!

I first read this novel during the summer when I was in high school.  This became one of my personal favorite Christie books.  I've seen a number of film versions of this dark suspenseful murder mystery. I've watched the 1945 version with Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston and liked it because of the island setting and a cast of some brilliant character actors at the time. Watched the 60's version set on a mountain chateau with Hugh O' Brian, Shirley Eaton, and Fabian. I had mixed feelings about that version because of the actors who played the servants, the actress who played Ilona Bergen (a character who was not in the book) plus the 60's music and for some reason adding a fight scene and a sex scene between O'Brian and Eaton. The other two versions from the 70's and 80's I thought were both awful and redundant.
So when I heard they were doing a new three-part TV version and returning to the dark roots of the original tale I was excited.  Needless to say after watching this new version I was not disappointed.  The actors were all terrific.  I was particularly impressed with Charles Dance, Sam Neill, Douglas Booth, Miranda Richardson, Maeve Dermody, and Aidan Turner. The scenery was incredible, the music was haunting, grim, ominous, and wonderful.  This version beautifully captured the bleak, grim, and psychological torment these 10 doomed characters had to endure on this island of death and terror. Now granted they made some changes that weren't exactly in the book. After watching it a few more times I kind of understood why they did it. (SPOILERS) The scene where the four remaining characters indulged in alcohol and drugs was certainly not in the book however, in some of the original Christie books and stories drugs are featured and talked about. Also the talked-about scene with Lombard in a towel as their rooms were thoroughly searched was mentioned in the book. Now when it comes to the ending on TV I think they made it work well even though in the book's epilogue there's a lot of information and moments were important but because this was for TV  they had to rework it a bit so it didn't run too long. In conclusion, this was a great adaptation of the novel that explores the darker secrets people try to hide but in the end they will always come out. So to borrow a line from the new TV version ""I was fascinated.""  Charles Dance as Judge Wargrave",1483574400,,2457,4.645161290322581
7595541,5,B01A9IV54W,"4.5 stars. Terrific performances, terrific writing. Sustained suspense all the way through, and very psychological - scary stuff. My minor quibble was that there are a few occasions where it's hard to suspend disbelief about them going off on their own with a murderer stalking them, but this is a flaw shared by most horror/suspense films.

Nothing to do with quality of the movie, but did they seriously need to stick the ladies in the back on the artwork???? I get that Sam Neill and Charles Dance are very recognizable, and Aidan Turner is a hot property right now and is one of the protagonists. But MIranda Richardson doesn't rate a front-row spot? And Maeve Dermody -- a sort of afterthought there on the left side -- is the lead protagonist and spends more time on screen than anyone else.",1483574400,,797,4.692857142857143

There was no homophobe in the book nor a drug addict - and quite a few other changes. Many of the actors are simply miscast.

7595583,3,B01A9IV54W,"If you are a purist and prefer film adaptations to stick to the original text, this is NOT the version for you.  In the book, Anthony Marston is not a drug user and there is no homophobic murder by William Blore, no late-night drunken orgy, and no sex between Philip Lombard and Vera Claythorne.  Also, in the book, Vera hangs herself alone in her room and there is no final encounter between herself and Justice Wargrave--the method of his diabolical scheme is revealed in a postscript written by Wargrave himself.  Also, the heavy brooding music and dark tone that dominates the film from beginning to end is contrary to the steady but incremental erosion of ""normalcy"" and it undercuts the element of surprise that makes Agatha Christie's original story so captivating. This version has been ""modernized"" for viewers who MUST have their hefty dose of sex and grisly violence  (chalk one up to Hollywood!).  I was hoping to find a version that preserved the subtleties of Christie's plot and characterization, but I was very disappointed and a bit bored by the obviousness of this heavy-handed interpretation.",1476662400,10,1111,4.951612903225806

I enjoy Agatha Christe's works for their mixture of mystery, whimsy, and a slight edginess. This version has no whimsy and is so graphic and edgy that it is virtually a horror movie. If you are okay with that genre you will be okay with this movie.

If you are like me, you will find this to be dark, bloody, and very violent. It was so much so that I found myself not paying much attention to the whodunit aspect as much as when will the next ""jump scene"" happen.

7595599,4,B01A9IV54W,"Ten strangers meet on a Soldier Island to either meet with or work for U. N. Owen. He's hired a couple as house servants and a woman as secretary; the others are invited under various pretenses, all of which turn out to be false. Everyone except the host is present when an album is played after dinner. An ominous voice accuses all ten people of various murders for which none of them have been punished. One by one they die under mysterious circumstances, all following a nursery rhyme that has been framed and put in every room in the house: ""Ten little soldier boys went out to dine;/ one choked his little self and then there were nine...."" U. N. Owen is obviously ""unknown,"" so is there an eleventh person on the island killing them or is one of them the killer? It's 1939 and the island is private with only one boat coming and going, only it's not coming anymore. With no phone to signal the mainland for help, they are on their own, facing harsh and inevitable justice.

Agatha Christie's novel is a classic and possibly her best work (at least, it's my favorite). The characters are fascinating--sympathetic but obviously guilty. The least guilty are the first ones to go, building up the tension and the theme of vengeful justice as the story proceeds. The mystery is fascinating and the resolution highly satisfying.

This television adaptation is in three hour-long episodes. They are quite faithful to the book with some minor changes. The poem is ""Ten little soldier boys,"" a politically correct adaptation from the version I read in my youth, when it was ""Ten little Indians,"" though apparently the original name was even less PC. Apparently the current version of the published novel follows the ""soldier boy"" version. This change didn't really bother me but I did notice it. Another change was the characters occasionally dropping f-bombs, which was more surprising to me. And there's an odd scene when the last four people have a drinking and coke snorting party, presumably to relieve the tension of their immanent demises. I can see why the film makers put the scene in but it goes on too long and doesn't fit too well into the narrative.

The biggest change is a tonal shift. This adaptation is more of a psychological horror thriller. Most of the characters are haunted by their past misdeeds. In addition to flashbacks showing some of the homicides, there are scenes where the present-day characters see their victims on the island. The on-island scares go overboard once or twice but otherwise are great, adding to the tension and giving the show a very cinematic feel. But it looks more like a horror film than a whodunit.

The acting is top notch, what you would expect from a BBC production. The actors communicate their guilt, denial, fear, and suspicion with a realism that draws the viewers in. The period costumes and setting are also convincing.

Overall, this is a fine adaptation of Christie's book and definitely worth watching.",1474243200,,2964,4.7925636007827785

7595602,5,B01A9IV54W,"This adaptation of Agatha Christie's most popular novel is by far and away the best adaptation put to the screen. This is everything that the first screen adaptation (1945's ""And Then There Were None"") should have been. The cast is spectacular, with a particular hat-tip going to Charles Dance (better known as Tywin Lannister on ""Game of Thrones"") as Justice Wargrave. It was also interesting to see Sam Neill back on the screen. The cinematography is great, though it's fairly similar to a lot of themes seen on BBC-produced series. Nonetheless, the series captures the suspense and the mystery perfectly. I think the choice to do it as a miniseries, as opposed to a feature film, was an excellent choice as well. The series uses flashbacks appropriately, and really help to establish each character's nuances well and help us really get to know them, making the progression of events even more involving. The fact that we finally have an adaptation made in modern times, but still set in the original time period of the novel, is also a treat, given that many prior adaptations either (a) censored aspects of the novel or the crimes because they were too scandalous for the time, or (b) unnecessarily placed the action in the time period of the film's production. If I could give this ten stars, I would. If you're a fan of the novel or of Christie and haven't seen this adaptation, do it now.

Now for a bit of review that may contain spoilers.

I read the novel when I was in middle school, and it would serve as a catalyst for my love for mystery-thrillers. After reading the book, our class watched the 1945 public domain screen adaptation. While it was certainly a treat to see the book come to life, what boggled me was that the ending of the movie was so drastically different from the book, and the ending--resulting in the deaths of all at the hands of Wargrave--was what made the novel all that much more intriguing. I would later come to find that this ending--a very upbeat and humorous one where Vera and Philip survive the onslaught--was based off the stage version of the novel written by Christie after the success of the novel. While I respect that Christie wrote both versions, it was always so disappointing to see every screen adaptation using that happy-ish ending. This adaptation fills that gap that so desperately needed filling.",1473984000,,2356,4.7439024390243905

7595613,5,B01A9IV54W,"**No Spoilers in this part of the review**
I have to admit - the main reason why I wanted to watch this was because of the great actors and actresses who star in the mini series. I have never read any Agatha Christie novel, as I am not that much of a fan of murder/mystery books. Once I saw the trailer for this though, and read some of the non-spoiler reviews, I knew I needed to read the book. (Even though this isn't a review of the book, I just want to say I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it! I highly recommend reading the book! ) The way this is shot is fantastic. With the dark gloomy atmosphere on the island, a haunting reminder of the peril they are in, while the house and interior shots are light and refreshing, giving you the deceiving notion that it's safe. All of the actors and actresses did a phenomenal job of getting the personalities and little quirks down. You are left in such suspense the entire time! After it finished, I was left wanting more! I would highly suggest giving this a chance, especially if you enjoy mystery/detective type shows.

***SPOILERS***

The only complaints I have:
As I didn't read any of the spoilers or watch the play at all, I didn't realize that they had a separate plot line different from the book for Vera and Philip. I am not opposed to this change though, as I feel for TV it makes a bit more sense to add a love plot line for viewers. In that situation, with emotions flying and being on edge al the time, your feelings would be out of sorts so I do understand that this could be a feasible outcome. I also believed the chemistry for the actors, so that was nice not having to endure a forced attraction between two people who clearly have nothing there. I was also surprised at how the reveal of the killer came to be. I get that certain things need to be done in order to make it tie together for the TV and I think that Charles Dance gave an exceptional performance as the Judge. You get a better understanding of his disdain for dishonorable people and need for justice as he gives his monologue to Vera. However, I enjoyed having to put the pieces together myself when I read the book.",1472515200,,2169,4.300733496332518
7595614,5,B01A9IV54W,"Seriously one of the best versions of an Agatha Christie piece I have ever seen.  I have read this book more than 15 times-  this film interpretation is perfection.

I have the other two films based on this novel, but had never read it, so I thought this was my opportunity. Well after reading the book, surprise of surprises!!! I did not realize how watered down the other versions were until I finished the book. When I watched this DVD I was enthralled! I watched it all in one sitting, and the almost 3 hours flew by. The character developments were fascinating as the previous two outings did not delve into the full background of the 'guests'. I also loved seeing familiar actors/actresses from so many other British films. Miranda Richardson, Sam Neill, Anna Maxwell Martin (The Bletchley Circle), Charles Dance (Game of Thrones) are all stunning, and what a cast to gather together to make this a wonderful viewing experience. This is a much  more meatier production of the novel and is the most faithful to Agatha Christie's vision of the story. Excellent!!",1472083200,,999,4.77456647398844

7595620,1,B01A9IV54W,"Agatha Christie wrote a nifty puzzle; you could try to figure out the answer or just enjoy her skill at developing characters and raising questions.  The 1945 black-and-white movie (directed by Rene Clair) was clunky but was still within hailing distance of the original.  This current monstrosity is not only bloated, it manages to be both ugly and boring at the same time.  Way way too long, way way too much looming background music, grisly deaths and mechanical pretend sex scenes.  All the fun and interest gone, replaced by a weary script and direction.

The only good thing about this was the number of actors who at least got a paycheck.  (Looking at you, Sam Neill and Burn Gorman and Miranda Richardson.)

7595634,4,B01A9IV54W,"A remake of an old movie and according to those who run Agatha's estate empire (we meet them in the DVD extras), most people's favourite Agatha Christie novel. This is the first time it has been done as a TV show. There's only three episodes though and if you took out the coming up next week montage, opening and closing credits in between each, you'd have about two and a half hours, so not sure why they didn't just make this a long movie, as plenty go that long these days. As a TV show it might have worked better expanding the time in between each murder to one per episode and had more episodes. Like any remake you've got to wonder what the point is to some extent of remaking it. It's still set in 1939 England, where social class and thinking you're better if you do one thing for a job over someone else, is still embedded in how you interact with others. When I heard this was coming out and set on an island (the original was as well) I thought maybe it would be a modern day one, or even a tropical one, they'd wake up having been drugged and dumped there, or had won a holiday there or something. But it's the same as the older movie versions.

Still it's a good tale, where a ten people who have never met each other are persuaded to come to a mansion on an island that is only accessed by a boat from the English mainland. They are told by the two staff that their hosts are yet to arrive but to make themselves comfortable and come to dinner in a few hours. At dinner it is clear that some instantly don't like others, some think they are better than their company. Then a voice comes over the PA system telling each of them of everyone's else's escape from a crime they should be punished for. Some try and play down what they got away with, some deny it, one guy says of course he did that and the rest of them should just tell the truth like him. Soon one of them though is dead. The next morning so is another. There's a poem in each of their rooms called Ten Little Soldier Boys (in the original novel this was about Indians but I guess political correctness has made them soldiers for this TV adaptation), in that poem starts -

""Ten little Soldier Boys went out to dine,
One chocked his little self and then there were nine

Nine little Soldier Boys sat up late
One overslept himself and then there were eight""

The murders seem to be following the poem in method of killing, who will be next? Who is carrying out the poem's prophesy? Since there is no one else on the island, it's got to be one of them. Since the boat returned to the mainland, if it doesn't come back, the only way to escape death is to work out who the murderer is and stop them. The film cleverly doesn't divulge how the poem ends (although perhaps if you pressed pause you would be able to read it while it is hanging on a wall, and it is also shown underneath the DVD (region 4 version), on the inside back cover when you take it out of the case, so best not to read that until you've seen the film).

There's no Miss Marple or Poirot in this one, but will you solve who is the killer before you are shown who it is?

I liked the show itself but could have done without the coming up next episode thing most British shows do for some reason.",1470787200,,3239,4.166134185303514

7595643,5,B01A9IV54W,"Since I had already read the novel by Agatha Christie, seen the 1945 film version & been lucky enough to see this performed onstage last year, I thought at first blush that yet another film adaptation of this very well-tread material would be redundant. I took a look at the cast list and reconsidered. I'm so glad I did. If, like me, you thought you knew ""And Then There Were None"" as well as it was possible to, I say 'think again!' and take a gander at this 3-hour adaptation, in three parts, that was broadcast in the UK over the Christmas season last year. Because what says ""Peace on earth and good will to men"" than a juicy murder? Or in this case . . . 9 of them?

To recap briefly: Eight disparate people who are all strangers to one another are lured to a remote windswept island off the Devon coast, where a grand house sits in isolated splendor on this rock rising out of the ocean. Each had received an invitation, personally crafted for and addressed to them by their mysterious hosts, a Mr. U.N. Owen and his wife (initials also U.N.) No one can claim they actually recall meeting their hosts, but their hosts seem to know each one of them very well. Our attendees are invited to the island with offers of employment, money, reunions with mutual friends or just a grand house party weekend with some 'bright young things', depending on the personality/needs of each recipient. They all make their way to Soldier Island, where it soon becomes apparent that this house party is exceptionally odd. Their mysterious benefactors are absent; the only (strained) welcome the guests receive is from the vaguely sinister butler, Mr. Rogers, and his overworked and cowed Mrs. In each room of this vast house a plaque hangs with the ""Ten Little Soldier Boys"" rhyme. (Changed from Ms. Christie's original use of 'Ten Little Indians' as both poetic device and title. The poem and title were changed because the use of 'Indians' is considered racist these days.)

Ten little soldier boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were Nine.
Nine little soldier boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were Eight.
Eight little soldier boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were Seven.
Seven little soldier boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were Six.
Six little soldier boys playing with a hive; A bee stung one and then there were Five.
Five little soldier boys going in for law; One got into chancery and then there were Four.
Four little soldier boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were Three
Three little soldier boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were Two.
Two little soldier boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was One.
One little soldier boy left all alone; He went and hanged himself

And then there were None.

-Frank Green, 1879

******************

The first night, after a sumptuous dinner prepared by Mrs. Rogers, the guests are startled when a recorded voice charges them each with an indictment of murder, naming a person from their respective pasts they are responsible for killing. Each 'accused' protests his/her innocence of the charges . . but in fact, each has a secret that they have never told anyone--and Someone has apparently found them all out. Within minutes after the reading of the 'indictments', the first guest will fall victim to poison. Over the course of the next several days, as a storm ravages the island, cutting them off completely from any hope of rescue or help, the houseguests are picked off one by one for their crimes. Either a homicidal ghost is loose on the island--or one of their number is a murderer. In the books of the elusive killer, those whose crimes were the least heinous are picked off quickly, leaving those responsible for the most heinous killings in their executioner's eyes, alive longer to suffer the burden of increasing mental terror as the bodies pile up. A centerpiece of figurines representing the soldier boys on the dining table gets incrementally smaller with each death, keeping the sinister tally of the diminishing numbers left standing.

If you don't yet know how this all unfolds, I envy you, because you are in for a treat. But even if you are very familiar with this story, this is a moody and atmospheric retelling that adds new layers of psychological terror and insight into the murky pasts of each of our characters. We get to have access to their memories and nightmares and can determine for ourselves if they are indeed as guilty as charged.

Our house party is as follows . .check out this esteemed cast:

The Secretary: Maeve Dermody (a new face to me, she strongly resembles an Irish Emily Blunt)
The Doctor: Toby Stephens
The General: Sam Neill
The Adventurer: Aidan Turner
The Religious Bigot: Miranda Richardson
The Judge: Charles Dance
The Detective: Burn Gorman
The Careless Young Man: Douglas Booth
The Butler: Noah Taylor
The Cook: Anna Maxwell Martin

The locations, costumes and period mood are all fantastic but it never becomes precious, moving always relentlessly forward to the next 'execution'.  I call the increasingly-unsettling yet starkly beautiful production design a mix of 'Downton Abbey meets Turn of the Screw'.  This visually luxurious adaptation of Dame Agatha's most complex novel is worth the buy.  You will want to revisit this murderous island with the exceptional cast again and again.",1469059200,3,5486,4.768177028451001
7595644,4,B01A9IV54W,"When I first saw the ending of this TV series I actually shot up in my seat and cried ""WHAT?"" I was watching with my daughter, who had read the book shortly before and said, ""Mom, this is the ending in the book!"" I was thunderstruck, because I ""knew"" the ending from a favorite movie of mine, the 1945 B&W movie with Walter Huston,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/And-Then-There-Were-None/dp/B00005QBZL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">And Then There Were None</a>.

This TV version has not supplanted the 1945 movie in my affections, but it is very good 4.4 stars, rounded down to 4. It isn't 5 stars for me because it is a bit long-winded. I think they could have safely cut scenes without losing energy or tension.

And talk about tension! Even the title is chilling, and this is a brilliant plot. It starts in London, August 1939, when Miss Vera Claythorne is offered a job as personal secretary at an isolated house on Soldier Island, off the barren Devon coast. As Isaac Morris, of the Skilled Persons [Employment] Bureau tells Vera, ""Mrs. Owen is expecting a lot of guests.""

Miss Claythorne, the butler and his wife, and seven guests. That's ten people in all. Each person's room has a framed nursery rhyme on the wall, beginning,
""Ten little soldier boys went out to dine
One choked his little self and then there were nine.""
Ten people alone  and there is no Hollywood ending.

I really recommend Bonus Feature #3 on the BluRay/DVD. It's an interview with Sara Phelps, screenwriter. She is fascinating as she discusses the tone and underpinnings of Christie's story.

Agatha Christie's novel was first published in England in November 1939, using an objectionable word in the title and poem, taken from a British song. When the book came out in America a month later, the title was changed to ""And Then There Were None"" and the nursery rhyme was changed to ""Ten Little Indians"".  Current versions use ""Ten Little Soldier Boys."" The figurines in this TV series are kind of odd cubist soldiers.

This adaptation of ""And Then There Were None"" first aired in December 2015, in three episodes totaling 177 minutes. The BluRay/DVD presents the show in 16:9 widescreen and 5.1 surround sound. English SDH subtitles are available on the episodes and the first three Bonus Features.

Bonus Features. There is some repetition  of conversation snippets:
....1.  ""And Then There Was Something: The Making of 'And Then There Were None' "" (43 minutes) Eighteen cast and crew talk about the book, the script and Agatha Christie. Hilary Strong (CEO Agatha Christie Ltd) says, ""Our dream was to re-create 'And Then There Were None' as it was written.... In its time, [it] was a deeply scary book. It was terrifying.""
....2.  ""On Agatha Christie"" (20 minutes) Fifteen people talk about the author herself. Noah Taylor (who plays the butler) says, ""My favorite writer, Michel Houellebecq [pronounced WHELL beck], has absolutely nothing in common with Agatha Christie  their books couldn't be more different. but he ... mentions her in a lot of his novels and he rates her as his favorite writer.""
....3.  ""On Bringing 'And Then There Were None' to Life: with Sara Phelps"" (15 minutes) The screenwriter, Phelps, had never read an Agatha Christie mystery before taking this job. After reading ""And Then There Were None"", ""I was incredibly sort of shocked by its brutality, and felt that, when I came to adapt it, it would absolutely be set in that place. It would absolutely be on an island so that you can't see the mainland. You'd be absolutely alone, because I think that's what she's written the book about  that you're alone with the things you've done and judgement is coming and it's going to be brutal.""
I've made fun of generic ""Greek Tragedies"" in my day, but Phelps gives an example of their power and similarity to Agatha's book.
....4.  Photo Gallery (2 minutes)

TRIVA: Christie probably wrote the novel with Burgh Island in mind. It's an island off the coast of Devon (western end of England's southern coast) with an Art Deco hotel that was very swanky when the book was written.  The real hotel and island star in the David Suchet ""Poirot"" episode, ""Evil Under the Sun.""

""People don't just vanish. Not on an island this size.""

7595646,3,B01A9IV54W,"""And Then There Were None"" is one of Christies best known books, though I think ""The Murder of Rodger Ackroyd"" is both a better mystery and a better story, as well as being the book she is best known for and the one that first made her an international best seller. I think ""And Then There Were None"", while a clever puzzle, is not really a very good story, and it's missing many of the aspects of Christies writing that I most enjoy. Additionally, as another reviewer (Asja) has pointed out, the premise of the book was that the victims were guilty of wrongdoing, but not crimes reachable by the law. Therefor, the murderer decided to kill these guilty people in order to subject them to justice. This adaption changes that all around, and cheapens the premise of the story, by making most of these people actual, strait-up murderers. Also, the natures of some of the characters are changed (Dr. Armstrong in particular is a much more evil character in this adaption than he was in the book), significantly for no apparent reason. The cinematography is lovely, and the actors are brilliant, but the whole thing is deeply dark and depressing. In that sense, it keeps closer to source material, because ""And Then There Were None"" is unusual in the Christie cannon in that it has no humor, no attractive characters, and no mercy in it anywhere in its recounting of what happens on Indian Island (Soldier Island in the adaption). I have not actually watched the second episode, because after watching the first episode and reading about the second one, it strays even further from the book and is even more depressing.",1468713600,12,1615,4.710247349823321

My favorite Christie story and super hot Poldark!' No. I was completely wrong. I only finished it because I bought it. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. For starters, it was way too long. It felt like there were minutes of nothing but music and scenery. In general, I didn't like the choices made. I thought there were too many liberties taken with the story, like creepy apparitions, and a sex scenes. Plus the reveal at the end is better in the book than in the show. If you like Miss Marple, Poirot, etc, don't expect this to live up to those versions you're used to seeing. Sadly, this one was just bad.

7595655,1,B01A9IV54W,"I thought ""FINALLY , this might be the definitive version of this classic story"" one with Christie's original ending. The 1945 version was good but WAY too lighthearted and the 1965 version had some good moments here and there but it was ordinary.  This however is a disaster. The pacing is so slow it zaps any strength the story has. And the screenwriter doesn't know what she's doing. There is no tension running through this thing, it doesn't even bother with the most superficial bonding between the guests when they realize  they are in danger or deal with each character's suspicion. The violence is amped up, which is okay, but the sex between Lombard & Claythorne
that comes just when both should be suspicious of each other is misplaced. And what should a screenwriter do when the group is down to 4? Why they should throw caution to the wind and have a party, complete with cocaine snorting and grinding on the dance floor. Oh did I mention that it all takes place in 1939? Way, way too modern.  I wasn't around back then, but even I know Englishmen didn't walk around mixed company from the bathroom with a towel just an inch above the pubic hairline.  And when they finally get to the end where everything is revealed we get a final flashback in slooooooooow motion that goes on forever stopping whatever suspense that was starting to build. In it's favor it does have Christie's original ending and the book's epilogue is very well presented, but after nearly three hours of sluggishness, who cares. (There is a Russian version of this story that also keeps the original ending and is well done, but I really thought this would be the classic version).

What's worse is that the viewer is spellbound until near the very end when this ridiculous premise is revealed and then it's - you've got to be jacking me!
None of the characters are portrayed as being total morons so it leaves one to wonder if Ms. Christie was either suffering from dementia when she wrote the story or the screenwriter and director of this farce totally blew it.

7595719,5,B01A9IV54W,"Agatha Christie is an incredibly enjoyable author to read, and some of her books have been turned into truly memorable films.  So far on top of my Agatha Christie movie list was always Peter Ustinov's rendition of Hercule Poirot in Death on the Nile, and Margaret Rutherford's rendition of Ms. Marple in 4:50 from Paddington.  With this new release of Then There Were None, I think the two previously mentioned films may have to move to second and third place.  The screenwriter and director of Then There Were None realized that Agatha Christie with this book actually created the prototype for horror films such as Ridley Scott's Alien, or The Thing.  The concept is the same:  Place a group of people in a remote location from where there is no escape and kill them off one by one.  This version of Then There Were None may start out as your typical Agatha Christie movie, but once you go into part two it intensifies into an excellent thriller that is nothing like the usual fare of Agatha Christie films.

7595723,4,B01A9IV54W,"This is much closer to a horror film than the relatively lighthearted 1945 film version. I read the novel more than 20 years ago, but I don't remember it being as dark as this version. I was frequently reminded of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (which is fine for me, since I'm a fan of horror fiction). Others may be put off by it. None of the characters are at all likable or even sympathetic (except Vera and Wargrave at first, but they turn out to be just as bad as the others). The actors' performances are pretty good (Maeve Dermody is terrific), but the evil level of their characters has been raised enough that we are almost looking forward to their deaths.

In the 1945 version, the characters all had various quirky aspects that made them interesting and amusing. In this version, most of them are just pathetic and tiresome. The actors who play Armstrong and Wargrave just aren't as much fun to watch as Walter Huston and Barry Fitzgerald. In fact, Wargrave's character is kept in the background too much. He's too passive and detached from the others, which makes him seem suspicious if you are not already familiar with the story. I don't think the ending was handled as well as it could have been.

The cinematography by John Pardue is really stunning, as are the art direction and set design. The close attention to period details makes you want to pause and examine many scenes more closely. The whole thing really looks magnificent. I wish they had stuck a little more closely to the details of the book, and made the characters more sympathetic.",1463443200,14,1563,4.6389891696750905

7595727,5,B01A9IV54W,"Agatha Christie's creepy mystery - And Then There Was None is fantastic.  The book, originally published in November of 1939, possessed what would be considered today an offensive title.  When released in 1939 in the United States, the title was changed to ""And Then There Was None.""  Apparently, this is Christie's best-selling novel and considered her masterpiece. Her talent in mystery storytelling is unsurpassed.

Of course, this is one of those tales that has been adapted multiple times on stage, film, and television.  As usual, I am way behind the times having never read the book or seen any of the adaptations.  Perhaps this is what makes this particular version astound me because of the great production and a fantastic lineup of actors - Charles Dance, Toby Stephens, Burn Goldman, Aidan Turner, Miranda Richardson, Maeve Dermody, Sam Neill, and others. From the opening scenes of the story, the mystery and foreboding of what lies ahead is expertly unfolded. Instantly, if you are unfamiliar with the story, you are drawn into the tale like those drawn to an island to meet their fate -- you are hooked and can't escape.

The story is about a variety of individuals who are invited to Soldier Island under various pretenses. Each invitation is sufficiently enticing to bring the group together consisting of eight men and two females. They arrive at a remote island off the coast of Devon, where they eventually discover they are stranded and unable to leave. Perched on a hill is a mansion owned by the mysterious Mr. Owen who invited each of the guests.  However, upon their arrival, Mr. Owen is absent and apparently will not arrive until the following morning. To add to the oddity of the situation, in each room of the house, there is a nursery rhyme of Ten Little Indians is framed and hanging on the wall.

The guests settle into their rooms and meet for dinner.  After dessert, a gramophone plays and loud speakers blare throughout the house the crimes that these ten individuals have committed by overtly killing or accidentally causing the death of another. They have arrived at their location to pay their due since their actions were unpunishable in the court of law. Of course, everyone denies their culpability except for one character, Philip Lombard.

The story is played out in three episodes.  By the end of the first, three individuals have met their fate, which naturally panics the remaining guests. They begin to suspect each other or the mysterious Mr. Owen who they believe is hiding in the mansion. Sitting as a centerpiece upon the dining room table are ten figures in a circle. Each time a guest dies, one disappears, leaving the number remaining in the house.

I highly recommend this fantastic adaptation of a most intriguing story.  Agatha Christie is indeed the queen of mystery and crime. There are advantages in not having read the original work before seeing this version. I've seen some complaints it wasn't true to the book in the end. Nevertheless, it left a lasting impression upon my unsuspecting mind.",1463270400,7,3056,4.90873786407767

I love Agatha Christie!  Started reading her books when I was 17 yrs old in from the Library in between classes in College.  This is one of my favorites, besides Death in the Nile and Evil Under the Sun. I have watched other adaptation like another other changes the ending to a happy ending which I don't like. The ending is what makes it a one of a kind story.

Pros :
-  Very good actors
- Cinematography
- Movie is well done

Cons :
- I just hoped they stayed with the ending **Spoilers** about the killer writing everything in a letter in a bottle for someone to find
- Love scenes between Vera & Lombard - it's not needed in the story
- Wish they made the movie darker (that is what I imagine it to be based on the book) :)

7595729,5,B01A9IV54W,"This show is excellent!  I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie. And they captured everything she wrote in the book. When the pace was slow, the tension was unbearable. The dark house and bright island contrast were jarring - aiding the unbalance you felt watching the story unfold. Backstories were really well done. Guilt-ridden hallucinations drove the plot. It was far more a study of the ten descending into hell than a whodunit show.
It is perfectly cast. Turner was excellent as the lead in this cast - afraid yet fearless and seductively Irish. Dermody transformed throughout the three episodes: Haughty to haunted and desperate to deviant. Stephens was on the edge of mental collapse and lashed out at everyone.  Dance as the judge was warm yet aloof.  Gorman was hilarious in his reactions to Turner and the rest; his quick suspicions led the viewer down many false paths. Richardson was sanctimoninious and hateful. Martin and Taylor were creepy - just horror movie style creepy, from their first appearance greeting the guests.  Booth was young and pretty,  singleminded and narcissistic. Neill was fascinating as he lost his mind.

But this fresh look at the old story brings new life to what many consider Dame Christie's masterpiece tale.

When 10 individuals are invited for a mysterious gathering on desolate Soldier Island, the guests, who share nothing in common, are mystified but intrigued--why would anyone ask 10 strangers to take part in such an adventure? But the trip turns quickly from lark to grim reality, and the 10 wonder who will survive, and how. Miranda Richardson, Aiden Turner (we know him from Poldark) and the rest of the perfectly cast players bring new energy to the familiar story.

They round out the characters, give them depth and richness and makes you really feel it as they're killed off, one by one. You feel both glad that they're receiving their comeuppance but still oddly sorry for them receiving it in such a brutal way. For instance, I've seen Burn Gorman (Mr. Blore) in several things, but this is a genius performance for him, and when he starts talking about his allotment in Edmonton... even knowing what he's done, it's hard not to feel for him and his desire for ""simple things, good things"".

And Toby Stephens is always such a pleasure to watch. His Mr. Rochester will always be THE Mr. Rochester for me, and he does not disappoint in his portrayal of Dr. Armstrong, a man fast approaching the end of his mental rope. Charles Dance is excellent, imposing, cunning and austere as Justice Wargrave and brings the exact note of gravitas to the role. He is especially effective when he shows a strangely fond side to Miss Claythorne, for whom he has an almost fatherly affection. It's... disturbing and perfect.

It doesn't matter how well you know the story or characters, you must see this production.  It begins with a mystery, ten unacquainted people invited for a house party by a family they don't know, and for reasons that aren't very clear, and  in a house that is at the back of beyond.  At first everything is all elegance and wealth, and there is a bit of a party atmosphere to lull you into thinking this is all going to be normal.  Nothing is quite as it seems, and there are jarring notes in the conversations and actions of these people, as well as the two servants taking care of them.  When one by one the guests die, in gruesome unexplicable ways, the secrets begin to escape.  Bit by bit the horror, and fantastically awful truths that these people have hidden behind their social  facades seep out and come to the front.  What an amazing job these actors have done, playing these characters and letting their masks slip bit by bit until the viewer realizes who they really are.  With an air of hope, one wishes that a Miss Marple, or an Hercule Poirot will arrive and make sense out of this whole thing, but even that hope dies and doom strikes.  It is so good a production, I am hoping that this group will continue and do others.  Especially chilling is Miranda Richardson, whom audiences are more used to seeing as sympathetic and beautiful, and Aiden Turner whom we know as the new Poldark is gritty and grim, Toby Stephens makes one want to hit him.

And somehow the director/casting people/whoever ended up picking actors who looked almost exactly as I'd imagined them since I first read the book more than 20 years ago. Charles Dance is terrific as the cold, calculating Judge Wargrave; Maeve Dermody does a fine job playing the very smart and very tortured Vera Claythorne; and sexy Aidan Turner just about leaped out of my TV as the dangerous, remorseless Philip Lombard. The rest of the cast were all spot on in their portrayals of Soldier Island's varied guests/staff, too.

The only small thing is that I wasn't too fond of how the ending deviated slightly from the book's ending. Overall, however, I loved this movie. The acting/direction/cinematography are all top shelf.

It is thick with animosity and little intelligent dialogue. The trips down each character's past life made the story, at times, distracting, and, boring. Someone (the director, producer, actors?) were carried away by their zeal, leaving the audience with one of Agatha Christie's most famous novels being decimated into a future video game and strange film.

7595774,3,B01A9IV54W,"There are some stories so classic that each generations seems destined to remake them.  One of those is Agatha Christies masterpiece And Then There Were None.  The latest version of it was a miniseries released late last year by the BBC.  With almost three hours to tell the story, there is plenty of detail, but it overshadows the story at times.

For those unfamiliar with the story, it is set in 1939 and centers around 10 strangers who have been invited to a house on a remote island by a mysterious couple with the same initials - U. N. Owen.  After dinner, the 10 people are accused of having previously committed murder.  And then one of them drops dead.  The deaths continue, and they follow an old nursery rhyme.  Since they are trapped on the island, can they figure out who the killer is before all of them are murdered?

When done right, it is a creepy, engrossing story with an absolutely fantastic ending.  And I never tire of it.  While its been 20 years since I read the book (I listened to the audio version), Ive seen the play multiple times and watched an earlier movie version of it over the years.  Each time, Im mesmerized by the intricate plotting that takes place here.  Okay, so a few of the things only work out because of an author making them work out, but it is still a completely joy to watch unfold.

So, as you can imagine, I was looking forward to this new version.  It boasts an outstanding cast with the likes of Miranda Richardson, Sam Neill, Aidan Turner, and Anna Maxwell Martin to name but a few.  They all do amazing jobs bringing these characters to life once again.

And, as you can imagine from the earlier comment, I had no issue at all with the plot.  It is the same story I already know and love.  There are actually two endings to the story, both created by Agatha Christie herself.  Theres the ending of the book, and a slightly different ending she created for the play when it was produced a few years later.  Im not going to giveaway which one this has, Ill only say it is my favorite.

Likewise, the costumes are magnificent and the setting is lovely.

So what went so horribly wrong?  The need to expand the story to fill three hours just doesnt work here.  There are lots of shots that are supposed to add atmosphere and create suspense, but they just don't work.  Instead, they slow things down.  We do get flashbacks to the crimes the characters are accused to having committed, and that part actually works.  This is an important part of the story, and its always hard to make it work in a visual media, but I thought it worked brilliantly here.  Likewise, the ending, another tricky thing to handle, came off well.  But the atmosphere and suspense shots?  Pointless and boring.

Whats too bad is that, as the story progresses and the characters get (understandably) more and more paranoid, that doesnt translate to what we are seeing on the screen.  If theyd spent more time working on that and less time setting up the atmosphere shots early on before the characters know just how much danger they are in, it would have been much better.

Additionally, the additional time could have been used to help develop the characters so we care more when another one meets their untimely end.  A couple of the characters I was actually happy to see die (and thats fine in a murder mystery, too), but some I felt rather blah about.  Im not blaming the actors here, but instead blaming the writing and directing that spent more time on visuals over these important mechanics of character development.

7595776,5,B01A9IV54W,"Wow! What a great adaptation! This is by far the best of the bunch. I've only seen the 1945 version previously, I didn't bother with the others. This version uses the book's ending rather than the play's version. When Agatha Christie wrote the stage version, she changed the ending at the behest of the producers because they wanted a happy ending. The book's ending was considered too radical in 1945 for film. I agree! Christie wasn't only at the top of her game but also way ahead of her time when she wrote this. Though minor changes(such as changing the Nursery rhyme from ""ten little Indians"" to ""Ten little Soldiers"") don't bother me. It was for the most part faithful to the book. The fact that they retained the original time period and the ending makes this one well worth seeing.

Please note that the edition contained in these disks is the original BBC TV airing rather than the Lifetime airings. There are 3 one hour parts rather than two 90 minutes(without commercials)parts.

I'm not going to give away the ending-but lets just say that the last ten minutes is really radical!!",1461024000,13,1093,4.6875

7595781,5,B01A9IV54W,"Agatha Christies And Then There Were None.  This all-star BBC production, the first time the Agatha Christie novel, the most popular crime novel of all time, was adapted for television, was presented at Christmas time 2015 in the United Kingdom.  And it must have been the darkest Christmas Carol ever shown on British TV.  Recently it was shown on the Lifetime network in the United States, for which showing, it  must have  been slightly cleaned up, ( I didn't watch it then).But I imagine, in this very strong, dark film, at least the frequent f--- words must have been cut, and perhaps the scenes of people smoking.  The novel was adapted for TV by Sarah Phelps (THE CASUAL VACANCY, GREAT EXPECTATIONS, CORONATION STREET).  Phelps stuck closer to the novel itself than the preceding film adaptations, all of which were based on Christies adaptation of her novel to the stage, four years after shed written it, which added a bit of humor, and a happy Hollywood ending.  (Although to me theres nothing much wrong with the old Hollywood take, in black and white, of 1945, directed by acclaimed French director Rene Clair.  Which was also, itself, an all-star production, headed by Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, and Louis Hayward.  Aside from, of course, the fact that the movie refers to Ten Little Indians, no longer politically correct.  The earliest versions, as the Christie, referred to Ten Little N------, even less politically correct. Anyway, any would-be commentators, no commentary please on Louis Hayward: he was a childhood crush of mine, and Im well aware of his character and biography.)

Never mind, the TV adaptation  which had a lot more room to grow than any big screen film treatmentwas set in summer 1939, the year it was written. As the world teeters on the brink of World War II, (to begin  in just two weeks), eight strangers are lured to a weekend on beautiful isolated Soldier Island, off the coast of Devon, England. Among them are young secretary Vera Claythorne (Maeve Dermody, SERANGOON ROAD); callous mercenary soldier Philip Lombard (Aidan Turner, POLDARK, the Hobbit Trilogy); General John MacArthur (Sam Neill, JURASSIC PARK); spinster Emily Brent (Miranda Richardson, PARADES END, SLEEPY HOLLOW) and dying Judge Lawrence Wargrave (Charles Dance, GAME OF THRONES). A pair of married servants -- who seem to have their own skeleton in the closet -- are already there. With seemingly nothing in common, and no reason to be there, the guests wonder who their mysterious host may be. All were summoned there for various reasons by the mysterious Mr. and Mrs. U. N. Owens, who are absent during the first night's dinner. But the ominous reason for their visit soon becomes clear: by the end of the night, the first of the characters is dead.

The top-notch cast of this TV event of the year (The Guardian, UK) also includes Anna Maxwell Martin (THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE, P.D. JAMES DEATH COMES TO PEMBERLEY), Toby Stephens (BLACK SAILS), Burn Gorman (TURN: WASHINGTONS SPIES), Noah Taylor (PEAKY BLINDERS), and Douglas Booth (GREAT EXPECTATIONS). The characters come to realize they are alone on the remote island; they cant see the mainland, and it cant see them.  There is no murderer in this most unusual creation of Christies: all are murderers.  And there is no detective.  The characters are alone with their guilt; realize nothing and nobody is coming to save them.  WWII is just around the corner: all the characters have been influenced by World War I, in which most of the men have fought.  And the tension ratchets up as the characters realize, admit their guilt, become more and more frightened as the number of little statuettes representing soldiers in the dining room table centerpiece shrinks repeatedly. The question is who among them is picking them off one by one, as  people start dying in the same way as the ""Ten Little Soldier Boys"" poem posted in each bedroom.  The last inhabitants of Soldier Island, initially strangers all, take a tragic journey together:  each  burdened with an awful secret, each trying to maintain the veneer of British civilization even unto death.  Suspense mounts almost unbearably in this chilling production; for the viewer, as for the characters, there is no relief.  In author Christies many cozy mysteries, the villain is always exposed, order restored.  But here, Christie was determined to show the pitiless cruelty of blind justice.

The box set, which I received as a review copy, contains three episodes on two discs, running approximately 177 minutes.  It contains the complete British production.  In addition, there are subtitles, for who would want to miss a minute of this dialog. Also, a behind-the-scenes featurette (43 min.); a featurette about Agatha Christie (19 min.); an interview with writer Sarah Phelps (14 min.) and a photo gallery.  Beware, there is some profanity; it also contains graphic violence, disturbing images and sexual situations.  It  is also one of the most intense works of art you can imagine; suffused with emotion as fear grips its characters.  The soundtrack, punctuated by moaning seagulls, and the dreary palette of the island, and its beautiful 1930s-style  manor house, contribute greatly to the mood.

7595787,4,B01A9IV54W,"I saw this film recently, and I give it a high compliment - it made me go back and re-read Agatha's Christie's mystery novel of the same name.  The novel lived up to the high standard I remembered, and the film is worth viewing.

Production values are very high, the cinematography particularly is evocative of rising danger and fear.  I was impressed by the use of color in the film.  Images move from the bright and sunny to the pale and cold as the situation degenerates.  The house itself made me think of a mausoleum. It is an icy and still space.  I think the film shows in a most effective way the growing fear and paranoia of those trapped on the island.  In one scene towards the end of the film, those few remaining alive have a riotous, drunken night that perfectly expresses their desperation in the ever closing trap. It is beautifully done.  I also liked the flashbacks from the lives of the prisoners awaiting death.  The technique was used judiciously and well.  The actors were all competent, but there is no standout performer in the group.  Maybe in this kind of story that's a good thing.

One thing I did not appreciate about this film - none of the characters were likeable, even in the very beginning.  Something was off about all of them.  This oddness kept me from identifying with any of them and ultimately prevented me from having any real sympathy for them as the story unfolds.  Maybe this was the writer and director's intent, but I think it detracted from the story because the viewer is just not surprised as the past of each character is revealed.  In a very real sense - they receive justice.

As I watched the film, I tried to evaluate it in relation to the Rene Clair film of the same name made in the 1940""s [I think].  I happen to really like that version.  That film and this film are completely different, and I admit a certain partiality for the earlier film.  While it lacks the tension and drama of the new version and it utilizes the ""happy"" ending rather than the novel's true ending, it is nonetheless a fine film.

The current film takes itself very seriously.  There is lots of paranoia and lots of repressed guilt here, but absolutely no humor.  The Clair version is quite witty.  The butler, Rogers, for example, is a hoot, and Detective Blore [sp?] does his Jack Benny imitation all the way through the film.  Of course, this film also has the magnificent Barry Fitzgerald stealing every scene he is in, and a cast of British character actors who you feel at home with from the first glance.  They are weak, but not truly wicked.  I don't think either film is better than the other.  They are both very different and each is worth seeing.",1459382400,6,2690,4.50206611570248
7595788,3,B01A9IV54W,"This version has gotten a lot of really great reviews, but it struck me more as something I should think is great, which is not quite the same thing. It's very slick, with moody strings, a setting obviously designed to be visually striking, and loads of A-list talent, but it just didn't seem that compelling to me. I kept expecting to see something fresh or different that would justify investing the time and money into telling this story again, but it never seemed to come. An episodic show of longer length might have helped, with an episode for each murder, but there really wasn't time to get to know or care about the characters, much less who was killing them. The story that worked for Agatha Christie's original novel is a favorite, but it's been done in so many movies and television shows that it takes more than a slick version to hold my attention and deliver a wow factor.

7595795,4,B01A9IV54W,"I have been an avid Agatha Christie fan since I was very young and this title became my all time favorite of hers. This story has gone through three titles; the second and most popular when I first read it was Ten Little Indians. Later, as with the first title, it was seen to be not so politically correct and was changed to the current title of ""And Then There Were None"".

I have seen every cinematic adaption of this story and I can say, that by far, this beats every single one of them. While most adaptations bring to the screen the version written for the stage, this brings to the screen a version based on the book itself. In the end the two (stage vs. novel) are quite different. Many seem to confuse the stage version with the novel and this makes for different perspectives of this film. This (novel version) has always been an anticipated version for me to actually see on screen.

The stress, paranoia, suspicion and misdirection are strong and potent in this version and continues all the way to the very last second. I believe that each member of the cast was perfectly picked for each character and each actor brings to life the people that Agatha so carefully sculpted on the pages of her novel. While there is some artistic license to this version, it keeps in tune with the story and adds to it rather than subtracts from the story.

Audio is appropriate for a mystery/thriller while not over done, I did not find it underdone either. The strength of cinematic art is clearly seen in this movie and holds little to be asked for in the end.  Time period is obvious from the style of the house, costumes, and vehicles. There are lovely little things to look for in each scene, for instance a little noose in the window of Vera 's compartment on the train at the very beginning of the film.

The change of the rhyme from ""Ten Little Indians"" to ""Ten Little Soldiers"" seemed a little off-key, removing a strong undertone of prejudice in the psychology of the murderer towards the guest throughout the tale and is not true to that time period of English history. After all, I feel art is more important at times than what is politically correct. Also there is not a full recital of the rhyme for people who are less familiar to the ""poem"" which is, I feel, imperative to the coming events at the start of the film. So if you're not brushed up on the rhyme you might want to check out a copy of ""Ten Little Indians"" before watching the film. The ever so fundamental playing of the record and what is on it is hard to hear over the frantically spoken character dialogue. This scene is true to the book but does not translate well to film. It is not done like the stage version where each character remains silent so you can hear everything on the record. Some people will not like this and others will see it as being true to the situation (guilty people running around like maniacs to cover up the truth). There is also added gore and some added mild sex scenes to this version. For the first time ever, viewers get to see the perspective of the characters' pasts from a more vivid angle, while this is wonderful and interesting, this is added to the story. There are a couple deaths that differ somewhat from the book and leaves out an entire scene and element of the agreed upon suspicion of the guests; specially the first search of the house and all of its grounds. As stated there is artistic license with this version, so expect some other changes here and there. These are the reasons I took a star away.

However, all in all, this is the most intense, accurate and well translated version of this tale I have ever seen. Mind you none of  the movies are perfect renditions of either the stage version or the original version found in the novel. Artists do tend to change this or that and in the end there is always something missing.

To finish, I do encourage any avid Agatha Christie fan to add this goody to their collection and those who are interested in a good mystery to grab it up also.",1458259200,6,4015,4.416216216216216

7595802,4,B01A9IV54W,"Agatha Christies 1939 AND THEN THERE WERE NONE was a grim and influential shocker. Ten people are lured to an island where, cut off from outside assistance, they become prey to a serial killer bent on murdering each of them in accordance with a childrens nursery rhyme. The novel was so successful that Christie decided to adapt it to the stagebut in doing so she lightened the tone and altered the ending to provide a happy ending theatregoers would enjoy. The play had successful runs in both London and New York, and it remains a theatre favorite today.

IN 1945 it got the movie treatment in an adaption by director Rene Clair, who very specifically worked from the play instead of the novel, and who endowed the story with a great deal of malicious humor. It was popular enough to set audience expectations for decades to come. AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, also appearing under the title TEN LITTLE INDIANS, has received over twenty performance adaptations, and most of them have followed Clairs sense of humor and the plays conclusion.

The 2015 BBC production dispenses with the play and instead follows the novelalthough not exactly so. Fans will discover numerous differences the novel and the film, some in the history of the characters, some in the manner in which the murders are depicted. Some of the changes seem to have been made in order to offer scope for a level of violence that is more implied than openly rendered in the novel. On the whole the cast is extremely good, with Maeve Dermody and Toby Stephens standouts as Vera Claythorne and Dr. Armstrong.

On the other hand, I felt Miranda Richardsons Mrs. Brent was somewhat lacking and I thought Burn Gorman was distinctly miscast as Blore. The film also attempts to recreate the novels flashbacks by inserting them into the house itself, and the result is rather like Agatha Christie goes to see The Shining. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesntand on one of the latter occasions it leaves a gaping plot hole in its aftermath.

But what this production gets exactly right is what all other previous adaptations have, often deliberately, missed: the sense of isolation and an ever-constricting tension. This is not a family-friendly adaptation, not something that can be described as a cozy mystery. No, this is harsh, unrelenting, stark, and often downright nasty. And it is often brilliant. Strongly recommended.

7595803,2,B01A9IV54W,"I am going to preface this review with the the following: I was very much looking forward to the release of this movie after reading the comments on the BBC site. I ordered it, waiting for the Amazon release, and, then, it was aired on Lifetime. I recorded and watched the movie TWICE, a week apart. Afterward, I felt the same, only stronger. I was so disappointed, I cancelled my order and deleted the Lifetime recordings. I will NEVER watch this version again. The following is why...

I had read of the terrific scenery, casting and performances, and screen play had done this wonderful book, worthy. I was disappointed and I don't share that opinion, AT ALL.

First, the imagery is well done at some spots, however, it comes at the cost of character development and meaningful imagery, used to create the necessary foreboding to make this mystery the atmospheric piece it is supposed to be. None of the foreshadowing used in Agatha's novel is done effectively, rather wasted shots suck up valuable time, such as a prolonged shot of a seagull flying alone in the sky. Meanwhile, each character's development is left to guess. Even important background information is left out of the script, but i will pass on examples, so as not to spoil.

The scenes are rushed, jumping from interaction to interaction, and important parts of the mystery are passed upon with lightning speed. The dialogue is hardly audible, as well. The oh-so-important recording at the beginning is supposed to have dramatic importance and set context for the mystery - yet, you can't hear the recording well, nor do the words explain, as in Rene Clair's version nor, the novel itself. The murders, as well, are rushed through and not even aligned with the children's poem, for which the mystery and murders are based! It's supposed to be central to the entire story!!! Of course, the poem topic has been changed, so as to avoid any possible perceptions of racism (at cost to story, believe me). Oh, and of course, a couple of sex scenes (not graphic) had to be injected, so as to draw more interest from those that need that in order to comprehend there was an affair. The excessive flashbacks as a way of conveying the backstory of each individual, is nauseating. It is overdone and poorly tells the premise for each characters presence on the island. In some cases, is repetitive beyond belief and adds nothing to the story but confusion and boredom.

Last, the casting is only so-so. Some are excellent, but a central figure, Dr. Armstrong, was wooden and uninteresting. Det. Blore was unconvincing as the bumbling detective he is supposed to be. It seems he was so inarticulate, he could barely utter lines at all!  The Philip Lombard character is needed to carry the story line, but he fails miserably doing so.

Really, this entire production is a disappointment. Only a few actors are compelling (Vera Claythorne, Emily Brent, and the Rogers) at all. The rest were either horrible or a reflection of the production itself. Oh, and the island and house are worthy as well. Good choices were made there.

All in all, I cannot even fathom watching this again. How anyone could have given this a positive review is beyond me. It is painful!",1457913600,31,3217,4.775179856115108
7595804,3,B01A9IV54W,"It says on the page that came up on the computer screen that there are 3 movies in this set, but then it only talks about this one. Amazon does this every time, and you have to check the customer reviews to see if somebody mentions all of them. This time no one did. That's why I gave it only 3 stars.  What ELSE is on this DVD?",1457913600,3,328,3.823529411764706
7595805,5,B01A9IV54W,"My relationship with Agatha Christie  now a half-century old  began with And Then There Were None. Why not start with the best: the best classic mystery writer, the best of her novels. Oh, I have other favorite Christies, too, culled for a list of Poirots and Marples. But ATTWN stands apart from the rest both in its form and tone. To start with, there is no detective, no outsider investigating the strange goings-on in the modern house at the top of this isolated island. There is no trying to find a killer amidst a gathering of innocent suspects, for in this novel everyone is guilty! Everyone is a killer! The question is, which among them is bumping off the others, and why? And while the central mystery is wonderful, the truly great thing about this novel is the tragic journey the inhabitants of Soldier Island take. As a group of strangers, each burdened with a terrible secret, try to maintain the veneer of British civilization even as they die off one by one, the suspense mounts almost unbearably, and any reader who hopes for some sort of relief, for that sense of order restored in the conventional fashion of a classic murder mystery, may be unprepared for how far Christie is willing to go here to show the cruelty of blind justice.

A mere four years after the novel came out, Christie adapted it for the stage. She made a powerful decision, with which we modern readers may or may not agree. She concurred with the producers desire to give audiences a happy ending  two characters turn out to be innocent of any past crime and manage to foil the murderer and survive  and in so doing transformed this tale of mass murder into more of a mystery comedy. That tone was repeated in the fine film rendition of 1945, directed by Rene Clair. Most of the subsequent film versions stuck with this happy ending but lost the charm of Christies writing (or Dudley Nichols screenplay for the 1945 version.) Some characters were hopelessly miscast or changed to allow for stunt casting (Emily Brent and Anthony Marston suffered the worst indignities.) Violence was amplified, and sex was added. But the storyline generally followed Christies stage adaptation.

The novel has been adapted for television quite a few times: three times in the U.K., once in America, with other versions popping up in France, Germany, Lebanon, and Cuba. As far as I know, these adaptations stuck with the happy ending.

Only four times, to my understanding, has an attempt been made to present Christies novel as it was originally written. First, onstage in 1944 at the Dundee Repertory Theatre Company (by special permission from the author) and again in 2005, in a play by Kevin Elyot that was staged in gory splendor and died an ignominious death soon after it opened. In Russia, a film was made in 1987 that you can watch on You Tube. (There used to be a version with subtitles.) I found it very slow going, but it does have the original downbeat ending.

And now we have the latest version, the 4th British TV adaptation, this one by the BBC. It was presented at the end of 2015 in three one-hour installments and is scheduled to be shown in the U.S. this spring in two parts. I had the opportunity to watch the production ahead of time, and I am here to report that it is really quite marvelous in nearly every way.

To begin with, the production is bleak and beautiful, portraying the period exquisitely and the remote setting and the disintegration of civilization with artistic flair. The characters are deeply drawn, more so with those who survive the longest, as it should be, but each one is a beautifully portrayed gem. The script, by Sarah Phelps, makes fine use of the luxurious three hours of storytelling she has been given, highlighting the psychological torture of this event and providing flashbacks and hallucinations at key moments to expose the truth of each characters past or to torment the doomed guests. And there really is a sense of doom here, one that manages to transcend the episodic format of this presentation. Some have complained that it ran too long; I myself ate up every delicious minute of it!

The original ending of Christies novel is, to all intents and purposes, restored, but inquiring minds still want to know if the adaptation is faithful in all ways to the original. My answer is: Sort of, but thats fine with me! Phelps focuses much of her story on Vera, which is quite appropriate given her prominence throughout the novel. Her backstory is handed to us, bit by bit, through flashbacks and retains the original tale of Veras involvement with Cyril and Hugo Hamilton faithfully. Other characters are given different and, to my mind, darker motivations to explain their crimes, particularly Emily Brent, Justice Wargrave and Mr. Blore. More important, we see a much more severe societal breakdown as the deadly weekend progresses, most notably in a debauched scene where the remaining guests indulge in drink, drugs and sex to get through a particularly horrendous night. Nope, this scene is definitely not found in Christie, but it shows with great power how shredded the psyches of these survivors have become. The adaptation is incredibly faithful to the original where it counts, and I would venture to opine that it will go down as one of the best versions of the novel to be filmed.

If the BBC, which now owns the rights to all of Dame Agatha's stories, can work this sort of magic with future Christie works (and avoid the mess it made of its recent Partners in Crime series), then all of us Christie fans will surely benefit!",1454025600,110,5569,4.7309278350515465
