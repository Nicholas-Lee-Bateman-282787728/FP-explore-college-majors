5635047,2,B00BJC8OJ2,"I ordered this DVD to show the Crime and Punishment movie to my high school European Literature class as a demonstration of Russian Novel Literature (most of which is so long that I cannot assign any without deleting every other text for the semester).  The movie was ""Not Rated,"" as many literary movies and documentaries are, so I didn't think it would be inappropriate to show.  Was I wrong!  Within the first 20 minutes of the movie, Dostoyevsky's main character is bludgeoning a woman to death with an axe.  This is not your typical BBC Shakespearean violence.  This is R-rated gore.  We tried fast forwarding, but the protagonist kept having flashbacks!  I had to turn the movie off and find something else appropriate on Netflix streaming for the rest of the class period.  Beware!  While it would be OK for an adult audience or a typical Friday night flick, this isn't acceptable to show in a classroom.",1395705600,3,911,4.751592356687898
5635048,5,B00BJC8OJ2,My wife and I read the book a while back and wanted to see the movie. We both really liked the movie.,1395014400,,101,3.6363636363636362
5635049,3,B00BJC8OJ2,"I bought this to have a copy of 1984, which I rate 4 star.  I did not care for this version of Crime and Punishment, which I rate 2 star.  The TV version with John Hurt as Raskolnikof and Timothy West as the inspector was the best I've seen, which I would rate 5 star.",1393286400,10,268,3.8545454545454545
5635050,5,B00BJC8OJ2,I am a fan of John Hurt and finally took the time to watch these movies last week and I enjoyed both of them very much.,1392681600,,119,3.6153846153846154
5635051,5,B00BJC8OJ2,"Got this quick, good quality, very decent prices, and also glad to be able to find both of these films.",1388793600,,103,4.2
5635052,5,B00BJC8OJ2,"Not well known, these movies are rather different from each other in style and mood but well-made and engaging.  What joins them aside from Hurt's performances are similar themes of grim social conditions calling for character soul-searching.  1984 was Burton's last movie.",1383091200,5,273,5.476190476190476
5635053,4,B00BJC8OJ2,"I like and collect old classic movies and Crime and Punishment is definitely a must for my collection and for anybody else who hasn't seen it.

5635054,5,B00BJC8OJ2,"1984 holds many parallels to the world today. Hard to believe it was written so long ago as it is exactly what we are heading for in today's society. It is a perfect example of ""don't let this happen to us"".
Crime and Punishment was OK.",1375401600,8,236,4.1521739130434785
5635055,5,B00BJC8OJ2,I've wanted this for a while...so glad I got it,1482364800,,47,3.8
5635056,5,B00BJC8OJ2,"1984 is dark and uncomfortable, but captures the essence of Orwell's novel.  I liked Crime and Punishment as well, despite being set in post-Soviet Russia.  John Hurt is a fascinating Porfiry, the best since Edward Arnold in the 1930's. This film sticks to the Dostoyevsky masterpiece. In all, two of my favorite novels well done.",1479772800,3,330,4.9818181818181815

5635060,4,B00BJC8OJ2,1984 is a true classic of the future Big Brother. The Crime & Punishment not so....Bought only for 1984.,1453766400,,104,4.526315789473684
5635061,5,B00BJC8OJ2,Got this for the 1984 which i love. the other movie sucks. but all and all good thanks,1441152000,,86,3.8333333333333335
5635062,1,B00BJC8OJ2,"Don't waste one second  on this pos movie. I got around 20 minutes into Crime and Punishment and had to watch something else, it was that bad. The acting seemed scripted and rushed. It didn't flow because all the lines were on queue, just a horrible beginning if nothing else. On the other hand, 1984 alone was worth the price.",1441065600,,327,4.45
5635063,1,B00BJC8OJ2,"This review is with respect to Crime and Punishment only.  This version of Crime and Punishment is not the one with John Hurt as the main character, which was great.  This version is modernized crap - unwatchable.",1437782400,,213,4.72972972972973
5635064,5,B00BJC8OJ2,1984 is a pretty good film. It definitely shows what were living through now.,1434585600,,77,4.571428571428571
5635065,5,B00BJC8OJ2,"1984: When I first read the book, my imagination conjured up an audio visual experience exactly like this movie. All movies are adapted to fit a time frame and mostly screenwriters and directors must make tough choices what to leave out. I think they did well. The scene setting and art directors reconstruction of the dreary landscape background greatly contributes to very real acting, that you rarely find nowadays, to make this a must see.
Although the story reminds of the communist hierarchy of totalitarianism, as does  Orwells Animal Farm, the message of the book is emphasized in the movie which is very depressing and scary. If you pay close attention, we are already living in that era. With real world mind bending realities like North Korea, among other, already active for decades.  I wonder how Orwell would have portrayed the follow-up: 2020 for instance, as played out in the land of the free?",1428105600,8,910,4.902597402597403
5635066,5,B00BJC8OJ2,of course the movies are never the same as the books. and you can never pack in all the great things that you have in the book but this movie really does come close. John Hurt should have won an award for this movie. anyone who has never read the book definitely needs to see this movie especially considering we are living in these times right now! who knew when I read the book in high school the the content would actually happen in my lifetime. 30 years later here it is a little late but it's here nonetheless. this should be required reading for every single child or student in high school. I know it was in my high school. people need to educate themselves because the schools today are not going to do it. this is a great movie and in addition you get a bonus movie as well,1426291200,11,782,4.185430463576159

5635072,5,B00BJC8OJ2,"I exult the John Hurt performance in 1984.  No one else could have portrayed Winston Smith as well, not to mention look so bedraggled and worn down by society as Hurt did.  Probably drunk, Richard Burton gave a stellar performance as well.",1419033600,,239,4.666666666666667
5635073,5,B00BJC8OJ2,This version of G. Orwell's 1984 should be mandatory in every freshman's curriculum at high school level.  This rendition shows Orwell's point about how people are politically managed is particularly artful. A gripping movie on its own.,1418169600,3,236,5.378378378378378
5635074,5,B00BJC8OJ2,"What can I say? Two movies for the price of one. 1984 is a fine adaptation of the book I enjoy it immensely. Even if Crime & Punishment is a total clanker, this is worth the price.",1417910400,,180,3.891891891891892

5635079,5,B00BJC8OJ2,"Every time I watch 1984, I gain new perspectives and a new appreciation for George Orwell's masterpiece.  The critics weren't impressed of course as they felt it chopped too much and ended up with a plot line that progressed too slowly.  That is what makes this film so great and explains why those too incompetent to be film makers become critics.  1984 cuts through the fluff and developed the salient parts of the storyline.  They filmed in Eastman color and the developer processed the negative in a special way that made the visuals muted, drab and made Oceania made to appear even more ugly, and depressing than traditional B/W or color film cold achieve. Darn! Writing this has made me want to re-watch it again this evening which I will do without fail.

Crime & Punishment is well done ""second feature"" but cannot compete with 1984

Hope this rambling critique proves useful for prospective buyers, but it's almost time now for the main feature and gotta go..",1406678400,27,968,4.766467065868263

5635081,1,B00BJC8OJ2,"Not as good as BBC's 1977 production of Crime & Punishment (mini series).
That was top class with top notch actors like Timothy
West,Sian Philips and John
Hurt in his youth.
Wish this BBC mini series was made available for order again.",1402790400,6,235,4.619047619047619
5635082,4,B00BJC8OJ2,"Ahhh, John Hurt.  Will I ever see him in a role that I didn't enjoy?

1984 is a classic of course.  And the main reason I bought this.  Crime & Punishment meanwhile is thought-provoking (if strangely updated from what I can tell, though I haven't read the book so I can't say for sure) but Crispin Glover goes too over the top for my taste; I found it hard to take him seriously.  The rest of the cast is worth seeing however.

This set is very bare bones -- there are no bonus features of any kind for either film.  Still it's affordable and it's double the John Hurt for double the amazingness.",1399680000,3,596,4.221238938053097
5635083,5,B00BJC8OJ2,"I haven't watched 1984 yet but did watch Crime and Punishment (which is why I purchased this dvd in the first place).  Having read the book I wanted to see this version of the movie. Wow. I have to say that I have never seen a movie like this before. The main character does a staggeringly good job in his role. I really couldn't say that another actor would have done better. The plot too is unique (duh) but it's just surprising to see how novel the plot from this old book still remains given all the films that I have seen. The movie of course is philosophical and one will better appreciate the movie if they have at least a cursory knowledge of existentialism, Nietzsche, and D. Though this movie isn't a high-budget production, this almost makes it better as its an eccentric sort of film that almost has more liberty with less. This is such a peculiar movie that in the 5 different times I heard a swear word, the word had a completely different affect on me than they do in any other movie I have seen. At times the curse words seemed more powerful than normal. At other times it seemed the words weren't even good enough for the movie itself. I'll definitely re-watch this film. It's one of the few where you really get a sense for the psychological damage that can upon the mind of the damager. Finally, I will just note that due to the content and violence in one scene this film is for a mature audience.",1399248000,2,1417,4.347169811320755
5635084,1,B00BJC8OJ2,I thought this was the BBC Crime & Punishment miniseries starring John Hurt. Instead it's an appalling latter-day Americanisation. Don't bother...,1398902400,5,146,6.0
8569608,4,B00BJC8OJ2,"I bought this video mostly for 1984, however, I have always enjoyed John Hurt as an actor and there are very few movies he has starred in that I dislike.  1984 did not follow the book as it should have, however, it was a good movie.  John Hurt plays the part of the main character of Smith wonderfully, giving the feeling of despair, but acceptance of his world with just a touch of rebellion within his soul.  Don't watch the movie expecting it to be as good as the book, but just sit back and watch it on its own merit and take in the messages it is trying to convey!",1508284800,,569,4.108108108108108
