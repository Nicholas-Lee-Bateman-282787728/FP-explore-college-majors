8750008,5,B01BETPCDA,Steve Allen's humor is timeless.  He can make the most ordinary conversation funny.  When I ordered this I was really more interested in finding The Tonight Show when Steve Allen was the host.  But this one was good too.  I recommend it to any Steve Allen fan.,1468886400,2,260,4.468085106382978
