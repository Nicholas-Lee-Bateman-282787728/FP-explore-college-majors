5439635,5,B00AIZ2C58,"Awesome! 30 minutes of tough strength training! You can use light or heavy weight, lighter weights for a more cardio effect, heavier for more pure strength. Kelly does 5 rounds of each exercise! Yes! 5 rounds! 8 reps each round. You truly leave it all there when you're done! An awesome value for the price!",1447977600,6,307,4.6
5439636,4,B00AIZ2C58,"Good Video. This was my first experience with KCM. I enjoyed it, but I do wish she would've given a little breather in between sets.",1438214400,2,132,4.32

5439638,5,B00AIZ2C58,"For me, this DVD has been a sneaky hit.  When listing my absoute favorite workouts that I love, it probably wouldn't occur to me to include this DVD because I just don't FEEL that much love for it.  But, at the same time, you couldn't pry it out of my hands, if you tried.  That's because it's such a versatile DVD that gives so many options.  And, the workouts themselves are pleasant and effective; I enjoy them while I'm doing them.  In the end, it really is a favorite.  This DVD offers two main 30-minute workouts and a bunch of premixes, many of which I use regularly.  Some of her other 30-Minute to Fitness DVDs have premixes that I don't really use because they give options that don't conform to my workout preferences, but these are right up my alley.

This DVD includes her ""old crew"" of background exercisers, including Lauren who acted as modifier. The two main workouts are structured the same, just with different moves within that structure of sets of moves.  In each set, Kelly combines two upper body exercises for the same body part, alternating them for several sets; then she does a lower body move, and you can do it with whatever weight you wish; then she does a ""rest"" move, a standing abs exercise, although she does do a set of planks here and there.

Kelly recommends having three sets of dumbbells for these workouts (light, medium, and heavy). One of the things that I LOVE about these workouts is that you can make it into the KIND of workout you want - light weights for an endurance workout, heavier weights for a true strength workout, or something in between.  Of course, you can do as many reps as you want to make those choices happen.

Here are the premixes Kelly includes on the DVD.  Each includes a warm up and a cool down, which is nice given that the main workouts don't include the warm up (a separate item on the DVD main menu). Above, I talked about how Kelly does standing abs work as a ""rest"" after the moves for legs.  Some of these premixes given options for what that rest can be.  I use the ones with cardio rests to turn these workouts into an AWT (aerobic weight training) option.

*Workout One with Cardio Rests (37:18)
*Workout Two with Cardio Rests (39:38)
*Workout One with No Rests (30:04)
*Workout Two with No Rests (32:49)
*Workout One - No Legs (27:09)
*Workout Two - No Legs (27:50)
*All Legs and Core (34:55)
*Cardio and Legs (37:13)
*Cardio and Upper Body (56:15)
*Core and Yoga (21:51)

In the end, I really value this DVD and the options it gives.  It would be a great ""desert island"" workout because it gives so many options.",1431475200,8,2593,4.480851063829787
5439639,5,B00AIZ2C58,"This is my 2nd Kelly Coffey-Meyer DVD, and I'm not disappointed.  I also have been using her 30-Minutes to Fitness-Weights DVD, which I find to be a very effective workout routine.  I also like that these are only 30 minutes in duration which is enough time to reap benefits, but not so long as to make you think you don't have the time to do the workout.",1425254400,4,355,4.2835820895522385
5439640,5,B00AIZ2C58,"I have bought three sets of her workouts and love every one!!

I have always worked out regularly but Kelly and crew give me an intensity I was not achieving with other workouts.

I put on muscle in the first month even after lifting weights with other DVD workouts for years.

I do a different workout every other day and never get bored. I like her and her staffs' bios on her website, makes me feel I am working out with those I know.",1394236800,5,437,4.178571428571429
5439641,5,B00AIZ2C58,"I love Kelly!  Sh.e is my favorite instructor.  After having her Bootcamp DVD, I got this one and she never disapoints!  I love how she has different mixes you can do when you are short of time.  I am waiting for her to come out with more videos!",1386633600,,246,4.0625
8552397,5,B00AIZ2C58,"Kelly's workouts are just the best!  You can't go wrong with any of her workouts.  Challenging yet doable, fun, easy to follow and designed to help people remain functional and healthy.  This is one of her earlier workouts that I did not have.  As usual I was not disappointed.  The 10-minute yoga bonus is great and works for a quick stretch and/or cool down after her other workouts.

I have been doing home workouts for a very long time and Kelly's are my primary workouts.  Every penny, every effort has paid off for me in health, fitness and feeling good.  I look forward to working out with Kelly every day.",1530316800,,613,4.509090909090909
8552398,5,B00AIZ2C58,"This is my fourth Kelly Coffey-Meyer workout video. I really love having the premix options so I can make these workouts last a whole week, or even longer, in my workout rotation without repeating the same thing. The variety in times from 20 minutes to 60 minutes is great too.  This one includes a yoga/stretch choice that I haven't tried yet but on days when I'm not feeling up to a full-fledged workout this is a great option.

Workouts 1 and 2 are circuits of weighted upper body then lower body toning with core ""rests"" between circuits. My favorites in the premixes are workouts 1 and 2 with cardio ""rests"" in lieu of the core. They're a little longer (37 and 39 minutes respectively), but I like to get a little sweatier.

My only complaint is the weird ""music"" background.  I have another of her workouts that gives the option of turning the music off.  This one should have that option.",1513209600,,895,4.53416149068323
8552399,5,B00AIZ2C58,I have at least 6 of Kelly's dvd's and love them all.,1512432000,,53,3.5
8552400,5,B00AIZ2C58,I enjoy these workouts and think they're effective.,1498521600,,51,5.5
8552401,5,B00AIZ2C58,"I really liked this dvd. It was easy to follow and worked all parts of the body in 30 minutes or if you prefer, you can do both workouts equally an hour.",1490054400,2,153,3.8125
8552402,4,B00AIZ2C58,"Love her teaching style. Sometimes she moves a little too quickly when moving onto the next exercise, but I'll appreciate that as I get more comfortable with the tape.",1489449600,,167,4.793103448275862
8552403,5,B00AIZ2C58,"I've been alternating the 2 workouts on this dvd and I have finally gotten rid of my back fat! Just noticed it 2day while trying on a top with a low cut back. The exercises work upper & lower body evenly, which is hard to find. Many workouts focus more on upper body.",1488240000,2,267,4.056603773584905
8552404,5,B00AIZ2C58,"This is my first Kelly Coffey-Meyer video and I am very pleased.  I can't compare it to her other videos obvoiusly but I am happy with this.  I like that the work outs are ~30 minutes and she combines cardio AND strength building. This fits nicely into my workout schedule, I will be buying more from her.",1485043200,2,305,4.333333333333333
8552405,5,B00AIZ2C58,"Nothing more to say then she is true to her word.  I had never tried any of her DVD'S before and this is brutal, but does the job. Count on using heavy weights, breaking a good sweat and you get an awesome workout. Since there is no real warm up I do a half hour of cardio before doing this as I need to warm up my muscles before jumping into weight lifting.",1481068800,,358,3.904109589041096
8552406,5,B00AIZ2C58,"My husband and I work out every morning before work. I discovered Kelly's DVDs 6 months ago and love her style! I enjoy that she is exercising the entire routine. She encourages you to keep pushing,  stresses proper form and has a infectious personality!",1478995200,3,254,4.7727272727272725
