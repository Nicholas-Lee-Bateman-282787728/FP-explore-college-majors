1234627,4,B00000JMPB,"i object to the characterization of monty python as funny. it is well known that this whole ""comedy troupe"" act is just a front for the  international smuggling of little pink pussycats, one called chris and the  other one not. and the so called ""rumors"" of cannabilism by  myself and the other reviewers of this dvd are just that, rumors.

1234628,4,B00000JMPB,"While Monty Python's Flying Circus is defiently one of the funniest comedy troupes to come out of the 20th Century, and this set is well worth buying, I would warn those of you who aren't die-hard fans that, of the four DVD  sets out right now, this one is probably the least funny.  The Pythoners  were apparently rushed as they wrapped up their first season of shows (some  of these episodes were recorded only a week before airing!), and the humor  in these DVDs, particularly the last three episodes, on DVD 4--are far from  prime Python.
Still, there's ""Upperclass Twit of the Year"" and  ""Albatross"" and enough others to make it worthwhile!",949276800,6,645,4.705357142857143
1234629,5,B00000JMPB,"As someone who once wrote a ten-page paper in college about the Pythons, I'm not going to go into such great lengths in this small review.  Such a task has already been achieved in Kim ""Howard"" Johnson's two  excellent books, among many others.  Suffice it to say that...THIS MAY BE  THE SINGLE FUNNIEST SKETCH-COMEDY SHOW EVER.  This is NOT an exaggeration.  If you can get beyond the obviously ""British"" aspects of the show  (remember that this was produced from 1969 to 1975, in the most Anglo-Saxon  of all nations), you will discover an unending goldmine of comedy,  guaranteed.",946944000,,583,4.86734693877551

And, the Dead Parrot? All of these skits and more can be found on this 2 cd set. If you like the obscurity that is Python, then this is the set to purchase.
 The one segment I did not like was aliens turning into Scotsmen. That went on far too long.",1080259200,6,424,4.3544303797468356
1234651,5,B00000JMPB,"This, the second half of the first season, is I think the best period of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus."" A vast majority of the best sketches are here (""Lumberjack Song,"" ""Dead Parrot,"" ""Upperclass Twit of the Year,"" ""Albatross,"" ""Pet Conversions,"" and ""Hell's Grannies), along with what I think are the two single best episodes. Episode 8 (""Full Frontal Nudity"") and Episode 9 (""The Ant, an Introduction"").
The DVD set looks slightly better than the videos released in 1989 by Paramount. The filmed, location sequences look pretty grainy, but that's how they've always looked. With every episode, there is an opprotunity to jump straight to the sketches, or to read a tidbit.
On the extras front, there's a clip from ""Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,"" scenes from other TV episodes, biographies, Pythonisms, a weblink, trivia games, and the always excellent Gilliamnations art gallery.",1046390400,5,894,5.215277777777778
1234652,5,B00000JMPB,"I got this because I'd been having a need to see the North Minehead by-elections (sp?), and the candidacy of Mr.  Hilter with his map
of Stalingrad and his friend Ron Vibbentrop.  The dead Parrot sketch
is also featured, as is the two mafiosi telling Col. Graham Chapman
""It's a nice army base you've got here.""  And there is the classic
of the blanc-manges who are turning everyone into Scotsman.  (Angus
Pogorny what do ya mean?  He was ne'er so much a man as he was a
blanc-mange.)  Apparently the Lumberjack song is on this set too, but
I haven't gotten around to it yet.  Though I have been humming it for
several days.",1025568000,,624,4.421052631578948

1234654,5,B00000JMPB,"This past Christmas I was blessed to recieve the wonderful ""Monty Python's Flying Circus Set 2""... This is the set to start out with for beginning Python fans. It includes some of the best sketches that the Pythons have ever shot out. Although it's a little ""Border line"" sometimes (If you're more the conservative type like me) it tends to make up for it drastically with hours of hilarious twits and British humor. It's raw enough to keep away from younger viewers (I'd rate this film PG-13) but safe enough (if you've got your finger on the fast forward button) to show to some younger crowds. After I saw this set I've become positively entranced in Monty Python's zany humor. I plan on buying all of the sets of videos in the VERY near future. I think it's the best $... you'll spend.
So I HIGHLY recommend it to ANYONE with a sense of humor.
Yours Faithfully,

1234655,5,B00000JMPB,"The chaps must have been particularly inspired by the muses during the latter half of the first season of the Flying Circus, which makes up the material for these two DVD's.  (Episodes 7-13)  Almost all of my favourite sketches are on these discs, including Blancmanges Playing Tennis, North Minehead Byelection (with ""Mr. Hilter""), Buying a Bed, and, of course, the definitive Dead Parrot Sketch.  There is really very little else to say about the material except that if you've never seen Monty Python in its original form, this is the disc to buy, and if you're a fan and can only afford to buy this collection one at a time (like me), this is the one to start off with.
The quality is very good - the sound is much clearer than I ever heard on those PBS marathons.  Although the discs were produced by A&E, they are the full episodes as they were meant to be seen (""full frontal nudity"" and all), not the hatchet jobs they broadcast on their network.  Of great use is the subtitle feature - the laugh track is so overbearing it's next to impossible to hear some lines, which the subtitles can rescue for you.  Also, if you're not used to British slang, this should help you out as well.
The extra features are not great.  Mostly they are clips from other episodes - basically little teasers to get you to buy more episodes, I think (and also ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" versions).  There are little production tidbits (in the form of text) about each episode, usually explaining the origin of one of the sketches.  All-in-all, don't buy the DVD for the extras, buy it for the quality of the video and audio, and the subtitles, if you think they would be useful.",997488000,23,1666,4.526666666666666

7912621,5,B00000JMPB,"The scene where Eric Idle whines ""Oh, you're no fun anymore!"" is a deceptive one.

If anything, these guys are even more fun than before. The second half of Monty Python's Flying Circus's first season is even more polished and mad than the first, continuing the tradition of short skits focused on complete insanity.

In these episodes, we have: a serial-killer barber; lecherous art critics; an unfortunate man who tries to eat a cathedral, tunnel to Java and jump the English channel; Ken Shabby, every girl's dad's nightmare; thuggish old ladies; bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla; camel-spotting; and prime ministers falling through the earth's crust.

The longest and most bizarre skit is one where people mysteriously start turning into Scotsmen and streaming north of the border. Soon ""Scotland will be choked with SCOTSMEN,"" and England is pretty much abandoned. The culprits: tennis-playing, human-devouring blancmanges from the galaxy of Andromeda.

And, of course, the stuff that has become comedy legend: the scene where John Cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store (""It's a stiff! Bereft of

life, it rests in peace!""), and the Lumberjack Song (""I cut down trees. I skip and jump/I like to press wild flowers/I put on women's clothing/And hang around

in bars..."").

Of course, no mere description can do justice to the comic brilliance of these  dozens of skits. These five Brits (and one American, who did the little cartoons) created some of the most unabashed, naughty, nasty, and just plain weird comedy ever, which still influences everything from Saturday Night Live to author Jasper Fforde.

And all of this by men who often dress up as the world's most unattractive girls, with only a tiny budget and minimal cast. The 70s production values are omnipresent, and they are decidedly unpolitically correct. But in a weird way, these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise -- the writing and acting are pure, raw, unrefined comedy.

Probably the most memorable actors here are Cleese and Idle. Cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone, as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice. And Eric Idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe mountain climber, while Michael Palin does a brilliant job as people who are timid or insane.

By this point, the Monty Python guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of comic brilliance. In other words, it's funny and should be watched.",1129766400,8,2515,4.978520286396181
