As a result, when I heard about the existence of this CD, I was eager to own it and share it with my grandchildren who didn't know his work. What I didn't know was that this was a series of evenings from his variety show and like all variety shows, it was uneaven in quality. I loved the segments starring Danny Kaye. I was boredf by the singers.",1415491200,2,415,4.2
6565604,5,B00MA158LS,"Our family has always loved Danny Kaye.  He was the consummate entertainer!  We've only watched the first disc so far and look forward to enjoying disc 2 this evening.  Kaye not only captivated audiences with his many faces, but could charm you with his tenderness and warmth while either singing a love song, or just relating a story.
If you're looking for a fun and truly enjoyable evening, treat yourself to ""The Danny Kaye Show.""
You won't be sorry!

6565605,5,B00MA158LS,"THE DANNY KAYE SHOW is great and has a firm place in classic TV comedy/variety between YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS and THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW.

And it is Burnett Show that bears such a close kinship with the Kaye show, both of which were taped at Television City at CBS in Hollywood, likely on the same stage. Kaye's show ended just as Burnett's began. And both featured Harvey Korman.

So much of this is priceless treasure: Rod Serling sending up his own TWILIGHT ZONE series, which was on the air at the time; Art Carney is top form playing comedy against Kaye--as does the underappreciated Alan Young--creating a chemistry not found anywhere else.

Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Michele Lee, Nana Mouskori, John Gary and more. These are both revered names and also names that should be celebrated today. You'll see why.

And you get more of the purest form of Danny Kaye's talent, a quality never fully realized on the movie screen. It's simply Kaye sitting down and speaking to the home and studio audience as if each were an individual to him. The elegance of his hand gestures, the intent eye contact, the melodious voice. Like the image of Hans Christian Andersen he portrayed, Kaye was more than anything a true storyteller.

You'll also want to look into the other two fine Kaye DVD collections:
Christmas with Danny Kaye
The Best of Danny Kaye - The Television Years

6565606,1,B00MA158LS,"It is always amazing how a company will opt to license a rare and classic property such as The Danny Kaye Show, offer complete shows, and tackle the myriad of difficult music and legal clearances required, only to wind up trashing the end product.

The Danny Kaye Show was produced on 2-inch videotape, which offers a brilliant ""live"" look. Whether it was out of brute ignorance/incompetence or a conscious decision, MVD Visual has encoded this great source material to destroy the intended ""live"" look of the show and replace it with a jittery, contrast-removed film look reminiscent of 1950's kinescopes. Those who are prone to epileptic seizures are advised to avert their eyes during fast-moving dance numbers and jerky, sputtering credit rolls.

What a slap in the face to the ever-dwindling group of industry veterans who work so hard to restore long-defunct 2"" quad tape and preserve our broadcast history with the best possible quality, only to have their work ruined by the likes of MVD Visual.

This dud had all the potential of being one of 2014's gems.

UPDATE:  I have also discovered an authoring error as well as improper encoding. There is an incorrect track break on Disc 1. After the first show ends, the second episode begins for several minutes then stops and returns you to the main menu. If you select the second show from the menu, it begins part-way into the show.",1412812800,51,1388,4.839662447257384
6565607,5,B00MA158LS,"There's a story behind these DVDs. Danny endured bipolar disorder.  During his low period, he demanded that all copies of his show be destroyed. His friends knew that eventually he would realize what he did, and it would destroy him. So the writers issued a lawsuit, claiming that the shows were also their work, and Danny couldn't destroy them. A judge ruled with the writers.",1412121600,15,377,4.8
6565608,5,B00MA158LS,"Just found this description on-line!!!!!!!!

Danny Kaye was at the height of his popularity when The Danny Kaye Show debuted on CBS in the fall of 1963. A pair of Broadway hits Lady In the Dark and Lets Face It and a succession of classic films including The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The Inspector General, Knock on Wood, Up In Arms, The Court Jester, Hans Christian Andersen, and White Christmas made Danny Kaye one of the biggest stars in show business. His international humanitarian work for UNICEF, and sold out concerts at places like the London Palladium and the Palace Theater in New York helped make Danny Kaye a worldwide sensation. He won the Emmy Award for best variety performer in 1964, and the show was honored with three more Emmys, including outstanding variety series. The Danny Kaye Show was the perfect showcase for its stars unequaled range of talents. In this collection of six uncut episodes available now for the first time - Danny sings with Ella Fitzgerald, Nana Mouskouri and Harry Belafonte. He sings and dances with Liza Minnelli and Gene Kelly, and deftly clowns his way through comedy sketches with Art Carney, Rod Serling, Jackie Cooper, and a certain perennially 39-year old legend of comedy, who makes an unannounced cameo appearance. Also featured in this collection are Michelle Lee, Buddy Greco, John Gary, Joe & Eddie, Lovelady Powell and Alan Young. Series regulars include Harvey Korman, Jamie Farr, Joyce Van Patten and orchestra leader Paul Weston. Among the numerous gems found in The Best of the Danny Kaye Show: Danny conducting the Television City Philharmonic, a spoof of The Twilight Zone with Rod Serling, and performances of Danny Kaye classics Pavlova written by Dannys wife Sylvia Fine and originally seen in the film The Kid From Brooklyn, and Ballin the Jack from On the Riviera. Dannys other numbers include, You Make Me Feel So Young, Pennies From Heaven, and a rollicking duet with Harry Belafonte on Hava Nagila. Whether experiencing the joy that is Danny Kaye for the first time, or revisiting his extraordinary gifts, viewers of all ages will find the irresistible and legendary entertainer at the top of his game on The Best of the Danny Kaye Show.",1409702400,34,2213,4.9171122994652405

6565614,5,B00MA158LS,"I have absolutely no complaints about this collection! The only part that was wrong with it was there was not enough! I could have had another five discs and it wouldn't have been enough! Such an amazing program and a real slice of history! Really hoping for a volume 2, 3, 4, 5... I must buy for any Danny Kaye fan, classic television fan,or anyone just looking for a good time. This is what television should be! In addition to the people mentioned on the case there are also appearances from Jack Benny and Alan Young!
(An interesting side note. In the episode with Rod Serling, the story portrayed has to do with Shangri La and is a takeoff on Lost Horizon. Year's later In an episode of the new Twilight Zone (1980s,) Danny Kaye would play a character who was carrying a mystical object that he was passing on, he compared it to the passing on of shangri-la to the character played by Ronald Colman in Lost Horizon. Interesting that in the continuation of the show Rod created that he should mention a story that Rod Serling did a parody of with him on his show. that is a great episode! Possibly the best of the new Twilight Zone, YouTube it ""paladin of the Lost hour"")",1423008000,2,1175,4.419354838709677

6565616,3,B00MA158LS,"Let me start by saying I do admire the multi talented Danny Kaye.  However, if these 6 shows represent the very best of this series then it must have been a fairly poor show.  Surprisingly, this show lasted 4 seasons when the legendary Judy Garland Show that premiered in the same year only lasted a single season.  Judy's shows still look fresh and make riveting viewing 50 years later as compared with these episodes.  Even with the guests represented here the shows looked dated and are hard to watch.  I bought this set for the shows with Ella and Liza and even those two legends are far from their respective best here.  Video quality is variable and is not as good as we have come to expect from this vintage of TV shows on DVD.  For Danny Kaye fans only.",1421280000,3,761,4.392857142857143
6565617,4,B00MA158LS,"THE DANNY KAYE SHOW, which aired on CBS-TV from 1963 to 1967, was one of my favorite variety shows when I was growing up.

The two DVDs feature six uncut episodes. Disc 1, in black and white, features guest stars Jackie Cooper, Jack Benny (in a brief cameo), a very young Michele Lee, Gene Kelly, Art Carney, The Clinger Sisters, Lovelady Powell, Joe & Eddie, and others. Disc 2, in color, features Harry Belafonte, a young Liza Minnelli, Nana Mouskouri, Ella Fitzgerald, Buddy Greco, Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66, Alan Young (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mister-Ed/dp/B00NALHK8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mister Ed</a>), and more. The last episode, with Ella, Greco, and Brasil '66, is the best one of the six.

Series regulars included Joyce Van Patten (Dick's younger sister), Jamie Farr (of M*A*S*H fame), Harvey Korman, who moved to THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW without missing a beat when the Kaye show was cancelled in 1967, The Tony Charmoli Dancers, and Paul Weston And His Orchestra.

Whether Dana Kaye will make more volumes available depends on the sales of this one.

8671079,5,B00MA158LS,"Danny Kaye was an amazingly talented man, but hard to classify. He could dance, sing just about any sort of music, do various characters in various ethnic accents, sing tongue twisting songs, mimic other famous people, clown around and do manic comedy; I can't even list all the things he could do. His movies were good, some even great, but he shone in front of a live audience. Unfortunately, those live shows were not recorded for the most part. But he found a new media where he could connect with an audience, and that was live TV.

This 2 cd set has 6 full length ""The Danny Kaye Show"" segments as seen on TV in the 1960s. (Half are in b/w; half colour.) I grew up watching him on Wednesday nights at 9:00. It was a variety show with music, dancing, famous guest stars and my favourite, the skits and sketches. These dvd's took me back and I appreciate the shows even more than I did then. I hope at some time they will bring out the whole set of shows from those several years in the mid 60s. Not everything holds up well after that much time, but a lot of it does. This was a wonderful trip through memory lane for me.",1531612800,,1126,4.261682242990654
8671080,5,B00MA158LS,"It was my grandmother that gave me the gift of stage, television, and movies. She taught me to appreciate every detail of shows from story, script, lighting, and of course, acting.  At the top of her list of gentile and lovable entertainers was Danny Kaye.  These shows are much too telling of a generation long past to be critical of film quality.  Sit and journey back to a world of entertainment that only the great Danny Kaye could give...enjoy!",1508889600,,449,4.658227848101266
8671081,4,B00MA158LS,"I'm very biased in Danny's favor, so I enjoyed these shows.  Disk 1, in B&W, features Gene Kelly, then Jackie Cooper, both from 1963; and Art Carney from 1964.  Disk 2, in color, features Harry Belafonte (1965), Ella Fitzgerald and Buddy Greco (1966) and Liza Minnelli (1966). Two stand out to me:  the episode with Art Carney, where two veteran hams try to outdo each other in some funny sketches; and the one with Harry Belafonte. Kaye and Belafonte obviously had fun together.  Also check out the recipe Danny gives Gene Kelly to dance to.

I don't think these are absolutely ""the best"" of the Danny Kaye show, as the title advertises. ...  Liza Minnelli?  Really?  She was a kid at the time.  What about guest stars Lucille Ball, Satchmo and so on? But those two, and others, are on another volume of episodes from the Danny Kaye Show.

8671085,5,B00MA158LS,"While it is true that the transfer to DVD might not be great, it's what we have, and it absolutely doesn't matter.

Danny Kaye took his wacky movie performances right off the screen and into this show with bits that varied in quality from OK to brilliant. Guest stars were some of the great entertainers of the day, always still fun to watch.

A few of the bits are a bit topical ... for example in the first show presented, there are some baseball sketches that send up popular musical of the early 60s (My Fair Lady and West Side Story, for example). If you're at all familiar with the musicals, they're hilarious. If you are not, you won't get these sketches at all.

We watched a lot of variety shows in the 60s, but I didn't really become a Danny Kaye fan until many years later (just too young at the time), and so I never saw any of these shows when they aired. Both my wife and I are true Danny Kaye fans (she was before I was), and are greatly enjoying these DVDs.
