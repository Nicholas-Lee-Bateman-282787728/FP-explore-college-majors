2807263,5,B000P1YN9S,"Having done another workout from this series ( Circuit ) I just couldn't wait for the Amazon release and ordered it from another internet shop. I expected a great exercise routine and I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.
It is a creative, fun but at the same time tough workout ( warm-up, 6 different routines and cool-down ). Michelle Dozois is encouraging and cheerful without sounding silly. I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser & got a great workout, but it is easy for beginners or intermediates ( or if you have bad knees ) to modify. What I find especially motivating about the whole series is that the women in the background are not fitness models, they are 'normal' people who improved their figure doing this routines. GREAT DVD!",1194220800,14,752,4.704545454545454
2807264,2,B000P1YN9S,This workout video is too easy and boring.  I ended up giving it away.,1287014400,,70,4.0
2807265,1,B000P1YN9S,I can't tell you how annoying I found this DVD to be. Jumping around in ridiculous patterns that make no sense. I was not happy with this one at all.,1274745600,,149,4.0
2807266,4,B000P1YN9S,"I bought this video as part of Michelle Dozois' Your Body Breakthru complete 3-DVD set about a year ago.  I tried the sculpting and circuit DVDs in that set, and loved them both.  Then I tried the 30-minute express workout of this DVD, and I fumbled and stumbled my way through it--the moves were hard for me to follow, and I can honestly say I absolutely hated every minute of it because I was so frustrated.  At the time, I had zero experience with this type of workout (ones that involved dance steps, fast-paced moves, and workouts using the ""add-on"" approach to the moves).  I promptly put this DVD away, resolving never to do it again.

Since then, I have done a lot of workouts by The Firm and other Michelle Dozois workouts (The Ultimate Workout & the 10-Minute Solution Carb Burner), and have gained some (not a lot!) of coordination and experience with these types of workouts.  So, this morning, when searching for a cardio workout to do, I saw this one on my workout DVD shelf and decided to give it a second chance, doing the full 50-minute workout this time.  I am SO glad I did; this time around, my experience with it was much better.

Here's the breakdown:

THE GOOD:

1) This is a nonstop workout!  Michelle keeps you moving the entire time.  I was drenched in sweat at the end of the 50 minutes.  It will get your heart rate up if you really push.  Advanced exercisers may find this workout a little easy; however, since I added power and jumping to some of the moves, my heart rate was up for pretty much 40 of the 50 minutes.  I was still learning some of the moves, so I expect, after I've done this a few times and learned the routine, it will get more intense.
2) There are a lot of moves packed into this workout--a lot of variety, and I never got bored (I was too busy paying attention!).  The time flew by, and I did have fun with some of the ""funkier"" dance moves.
3) There are real women working out along with her.  I really like that in a workout DVD--it's inspiring.
4) The express option (now that I can actually keep up with the moves) will be nice on days when I can't work out for an hour.  Instead of 6 cardio circuits, it consists of 3 circuits with the warm up and cool down.
5) Michelle is very motivating--she is very perky and happy, but in a good way, not in an annoying way.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:

1) I am sure that others have had my experience with the very fast-paced moves in this workout.  If you're new to this type of workout, just have patience--eventually, you will get the coordination to do this; it just takes time. However, it would have been nice to have leveled workouts on here (one for beginners, one for more advanced exercisers).
2) Some of the moves were, in my opinion, a little overly complicated.  The warm-up would be especially intimidating to a newbie--like it was to me a year ago!  Even though this time I had much more success with the moves, do you need to pack so much into each cardio circuit?  I felt the workout could have been just as effective with simpler, powerful moves--such as more plyometric moves. (Michelle's cardio workout on her Ultimate Workout DVD does do this--has simple powerful moves that really work you for 30 minutes.)  I modified some of the moves to make them more intense and less complicated.
3) The cool-down was a little short (and, to be honest, the last thing I wanted to do in the cool down was. . . more complicated dance moves!), and didn't include enough stretches.  I stretched out more on my own after the workout.

Overall, it's a good 50-minute cardio workout; the good outweighs the bad.  I will definitely be putting this into my rotation of workouts.  If you have some coordination and experience, this is a good intermediate cardio workout (and it seems like it's hard to find a pure cardio workout these days).  If you have no experience with ""add-on"" type of workouts where they have a series of moves that repeat and get more intense, and you get easily frustrated, this probably isn't the workout for you; you may want to start with Michelle's 10-Minute Solution Carb Burner workout.  It has simpler combos of moves that are easier to pick up for a beginner, and you'll still get a good workout.",1274486400,,4216,4.4576271186440675
2807267,5,B000P1YN9S,THIS IS A NON STOP AEROBIC WORKOUT.  IT IS TOUGH AS SHE KEEPS YOU GOING FROM ONE MOVE TO THE NEXT.  THERE ARE OTHERS IN THE VIDEO THAT WORK AT A LOWER INTENSITY IF YOU NEED TO START OUT SLOWER.  I DO ADVANCED WORKOUTS AND FOUND THIS TO BE A CHALLENGE.  YOU WILL BE SWEATING WITH A SOLID HEART RATE THROUGHOUT THE WORKOUT.,1268870400,,321,4.0476190476190474
2807268,3,B000P1YN9S,"I've done this workout three times so far and am still struggling to learn the steps.  This workout is fast paced from start to finish.  I do work up a sweat and feel I am gradually learning the movements, but because the steps are changing so  frequently you don't get a chance to perfect them.  It would be helpful to have a section where the steps are paced out slowly for beginners.  I have had dance and aerobic classes in the past, but this was challenging to keep up with the steps.  It's a great workout, but difficult to follow.  There is not a lot of motivation to come back and do it again.",1248739200,,601,4.219298245614035
2807269,3,B000P1YN9S,"I guess I liked this video, but not enough.  It just had a sort of blah impression.  I wasn't thrilled with the music and the lighting really bothered me because it made the studio look dark and old-fashioned.

That said it was a good workout, especially the first half or so.  After that I felt like I wasn't working as hard, I don't know if this is because I tired and let my intensity drop or because the sections actually got easier.  Eitherway, I did feel like I had gotten workout by the end.

The way the video is set up is that, at least in the full workout (there's also an express workout), there are I think 5 sections.  In each one the dancing works by doing a move and then maybe building on it (more intense, adding arms, etc.) and then doing another move to build a sequence.  I liked this except that it was hard to remember what each move was and Michelle does not cue them vocally very well so I felt I was a bit behind.  Also she refers to them by their official name (like a footballer, or the pony) and if you don't know what that is it's hard to follow because she doesn't explain much and the camera angles do not always enable you to see exactly how the dancers feet are moving.

Overall, I felt worked out by this video but when I think about doing it again I don't feel any motivation.  Honestly, if I could I would return it because I need videos that make me want to workout.",1246492800,2,1403,4.159259259259259
2807270,5,B000P1YN9S,"This a great all cardio workout. I love the fact that I can do the whole workout if I have time (about 50 min.), Or if I am in a hurry I can do the 30 min. express workout. It is divided into segments so you can customize it yourself if you want to. Michelle is an excellent instructer with great cuing. Very easy to follow but definatly challenging. There is someone doing a low impact version who actually keeps it low impact and does not forget what she is doing like on some other workouts. I can really recomend this dvd.",1232496000,,526,4.166666666666667
2807271,5,B000P1YN9S,"This is a great cardio workout. There is an express workout and a full workout. The full workout is 51 minutes long, and I actually enjoyed every minute of it - YAY! Michelle's cardio segments included some new moves I hadn't encountered along with unique twists on standard cardio moves. While the new moves and unique twists are what make this workout enjoyable, it will be a bit awkward at first - so be patient =)

This workout is great for all exercise levels, as it offers modifications for beginners. You will work up a good sweat so keep some water nearby! If you are looking for an all cardio workout, this is one you shouldn't pass up.  Highly recommended!!",1223164800,,667,4.55
2807272,5,B000P1YN9S,"Michelle Dozois is an excellent instructor.  She's very outgoing, friendly and cues well.  She's not over the top and she's motivating which is essential if you want to stick to using dvd's like these to get fit.
In this workout, there are six complete cardio intervals that each use very different moves.  All of them start out slow and then work up to a burst where it's all out.  I find the moves very easy to follow along with because they aren't too dancy or difficult to do.  There are the pony steps, lunges and kickboxing to name a few so they are probably all familiar.  It's geared for intermediates and I could see how advanced exercisers may not find this challenging enough.  I'm between intermediate and advanced and I find this easy to do, yet it's enough to keep my heart rate up from start to finish.
Michelle is a great cuer; you always know what's coming up next and I really enjoy this workout.  I highly recommend it if you want interval training and as long as you aren't a complete beginner or extreme advanced exerciser.  I love this.",1209945600,11,1058,4.49738219895288
2807273,3,B000P1YN9S,"I really like Michelle, but was disappointed by this one.  I had a hard time working up a sweat and found little opportunity to up the intensity to make the workout more difficult.  I only consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser.  I think this is a great cardio choice for beginners or low/intermediates.

I will say that I had lots of fun with it.  The moves were creative and very enjoyable.  I really wasn't bored.  I just happen to know of some much better, more intesnse workouts to fit in to just under an hour.",1207958400,9,525,4.40625
2807274,5,B000P1YN9S,"This is my favorite cardio workout for many reasons. I've tried a lot of other cardio only workouts from various instructors and they have never gotten my heart rate up and kept it there- this one does! Even if you're just doing the lower impact/modified moves, this one will make you sweat! Not for the faint of heart on a slow day either. Her cueing is great and while she could better explain a few of her steps (kick and fall back, box step), her moves are fresh and fun and it keeps you interested. The last segment is difficult to do on carpet. Short segments, lots of variety and an enthusastic instructor plus normal sized women (not the size 2 buff women you see in most dvd's) make this workout a keeper.",1207008000,6,714,4.37593984962406
2807275,5,B000P1YN9S,"I thoroughly enjoy this DVD.  The workout consists of a warm-up, 6 cardio segments, and a cool-down.  All of the segments are short, which makes the workout fly by.  The moves are simplistic, but fun.  Even though the movements are easy, I still raised my heart rate significantly.  The choreography involves ""big"" arm movements, which help raise the intensity.  High-impact and low-impact versions are presented, and 1 dancer sticks with the low-impact versions throughout the workout.  This DVD is perfect for days when you don't feel like complicated choreography, but still want a good cardio workout.
Michelle is encouraging, without being annoying, a fault that plagues so many group excercise leaders.  Michelle has 4 women dancing with her;  three of the women have very fit body types, and 1 woman has a ""normal"" body type that many women using this DVD would identify with.
This DVD has become one of my favorites and I plan to purchase more DVDs from this series.",1206748800,7,974,4.962962962962963
2807276,2,B000P1YN9S,"Too many awkward ""dance like"" moves for someone with two left feet.  The cueing could be better.  The music is fair.",1204675200,4,116,4.476190476190476
2807277,5,B000P1YN9S,"The qualities of this video are the pacing; the real participants following the instructor, the variation of movements/steps, variety of moves, and the advanced notice of movement changes.

Good Pacing
Michelle Dozois is an excellent instructor because she breaks down steps for the viewer to build up to the full move. She also lets the viewer know ahead of time what is going to happen and which side it will be on, so that the viewer can move effortlessly into the moves as they come up. The pacing during segments and the length of the segments seems just about right for attention spans.

Excellent Direction from Instructor
I also appreciate that she gives ""stage direction"" for the viewer, so that even though the individuals on the screen are moving right, the movement is identified as my left.

The video is broken down into segments from which the viewer may choose between or do all in one go. The entire workout is about 50 minutes, but there is an express version of one half hour to use in a time crunch.

The entire body is used, the heart rate is kept up, and there is enough variety to keep me interested. Moves are changed frequently enough and are complicated enough that I do not get bored.

Real-Life Participants on Screen
I like that there are real women, with more realistic body types than in most videos, following Dozois, including a participant showing a modified lower-impact version of the moves.

Enjoyable
The video is fun to do. (And I honestly do not say that lightly. I hate to exercise.) Some of the moves actually make me laugh, and the people actually seem to be enjoying the workout and each other, as opposed to most videos I have used where the interaction seems false and forced. (The on-screen participants are members of Dozois's fitness club and have their success stories available to watch on the DVD.)

The DVD is well shot with an attractive set. I can always see what is going on and don't get cutaway shots that leave me stranded in the middle of a move.

My Two Cents
The best part for me about anything from Michelle Dozois, and this is purely personal preference, is I enjoy listening to her. That is a huge factor for me because I find most aerobics instrutors terribly annoying and/or inane.

Don't get me wrong, Michelle Dozois is cute and perky and still very much an aerobics trainer (and has a seemingly impossible perfect body), but she comes across as intelligent and regards her participants and the viewer as intelligent as well. I find that refreshing.",1203379200,7,2518,4.678733031674208
2807278,5,B000P1YN9S,"I have tried a lot of videos, and most of those offering cardio either don't get the heart rate up for long enough, or they are too confusing with bad cuing and constantly changing moves that don't repeat enough for me to actually get them right before moving on to the next step.

This video does a much better job with a lot of repeating of steps before adding on new ones.  I felt like I got a pretty good workout even with my very first time with the video.  Now that the moves are familiar, I can get my heart rate up consistently and feel like I've actually had a cardio workout.  I do give extra energy to my moves to help make sure that's happening.  There is also good cuing for lighter versions of the moves if necessary.

I use other videos for extra strength training though.  I recommend the weight portion and floorwork segment of Karen Voight's ""Half and Half"" DVD as a good supplement to this cardio workout from Michelle Dozois.",1203033600,,945,4.365714285714286
2807279,5,B000P1YN9S,"I really wanted a DVD that was long, challenging and pure cardio.  It is a pretty intense workout and some of the moves, like kicks with a lunge back, are a little faster than I liked.  A few of the steps are a complicated and it was definitely a challenge and really fun. Michelle is good at motivating people, without being fake or over the top.  There aren't very many stretches in the cool down, so I added my own at the end.  By the time I was done I was dripping in sweat, and I felt like I got a really good workout. This is definitely a keeper!

I wouldn't recommend this for an absolute beginner, even though there was a low impact version.  People easily frusterated if they don't get the steps right away should probably avoid this DVD too.  I like the challenge and the focus it takes to keep up and follow along. It holds my attention and I will keep coming back to this DVD.",1202342400,,888,4.188235294117647

2807282,4,B000P1YN9S,"Rockin' Body Cario Jam is part of Michelle Dozois' Your Body Breakthru series, which also includes two other workouts, one strength and one circuit. The circuit workout was the first one I tried, and I loved it, as it combined short, fun cardio segments with toning intervals which included both dumbbells and band work. While I didn't like this workout quite as much--some of the cardio moves were a bit ""fussy"" to me, requiring a bit of a learning curve--overall, it's still a fun and intense cardio workout. The DVD Main Menu offers the following options: Full Workout, Express Workout, Chapters, Testimonials, More on Your Body Breakthru, Michelle's personal message, and Contact. The Full Workout is 51 minutes and consists of a warm-up, six cardio intervals, and a cool-down, while the Express Workout provides a shorter (30 minutes) version of this. No equipment is needed for this workout.

The 5-minute aerobic warm-up consists of simple choreography, gradually adding more movement and concluding with about 30 seconds of dynamic stretching. Each cardio chapter is about 6-7 minutes long. As she does in the circuit workout, Michelle gradually builds on the moves, starting with footwork, then adding arm movements, and also incorporating some higher impact here and there (one of the four background exercisers always shows low-impact modifications). She alternates right and left lead, moving through each choreographed series a total of four times. The exercise are quite similar in feel to the cardio moves on the circuit workout: they tend to be more athletic, with lots of knee lifts plus some kicks and punches, but there are also a few more dancey moves as well. As with the warm-up, the 5.5 minute cool-down is choreographed, gradually reducing the heart rate and then ending with about 1.5 minutes of stretching. The Express workout includes the warm-up, Cardio chapters 1, 3, and 5, and the cool-down.

All of Michelle's background exercisers in the Body Breakthru series are from her classes, and their stories are featured in the testimonials section. They are quite inspiring, as is Michelle's ""personal message,"" which details her struggles as the mother of an autistic son (the DVD case indicates that it is ""Promoting Autism Awareness""). I consider myself to be an advanced intermediate exerciser, and I found this workout to be suitably challenging; although modifications are offered, I think that beginning exercisers might have trouble keeping up with Michelle's fast pace here. Similarly, the choreography of this workout is a little more complicated than in Michelle's circuit workout, which might leave some users a bit frustrated, especially since Michelle's cueing sometimes falls a little late. Overall, however, I think that this is a solid cardio workout for intermediates and above, and I give it a final rating of 4 1/2 stars.",1198972800,22,2867,5.203463203463204

Its lead by Michelle Dozois, and she has a modifier showing all of the low impact moves. It comes off as a touch dancey, which doesnt bother me in general, but the moves seem a little stiff on this crowd if that makes sense. I recognized Juzy (sp?) from the Peak Fit DVDs, and I was disappointed to realize that she has been fit this whole time, and it had nothing to do with the Peak Fit program. On a purely aesthetic note, this is one drab workout. I don't typically notice things like this, but the outfits are all in earth tones and the lighting is sort of dim, but they could have been going for warm lighting, and then the background or surrounding space is also in those earth tones so it has a very clay pot feel to me. I guess I like a little more brightness when Im working out, but I never really noticed before this.
