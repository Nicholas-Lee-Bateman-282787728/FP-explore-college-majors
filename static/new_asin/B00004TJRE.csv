7922667,5,B00004TJRE,"I obtained this movie because of its dramatic true-to-life portrayal of the Muslim Culture in countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  The movie producer Nouri Bouzid who is a native from that part of the world, has provided this Movie, ""Man of Ashes"" in the DVD that enables anyone to grasp the contradicting cultural practices in such a nation there like Tunisia.  In some of those cultures, Women are kept at home to take care of the household, have several children, and serve their husband.  Night life is characterized by a night out with the boys.  One of the religious beliefs in those cultures is the Messiah will be born of a man not a woman.  In the public, although sexual contact by men with boys is discouraged, nevertheless it is practiced even to the extent of molestation but not Bacha Bazi (boy play - a form of prostitution).  In this movie, Hachemi and his best friend Farfat shared a childhood secret - although apprentices to a Carpenter who trained them, Ameur the Carpenter molested both of them.  Anonymous alleyway graffiti challenges the manliness of Hachemi's best friend Farfat.  Farfat makes plans to run away into Tunis.  Hachemi is anxious about how all of this will overshadow his approaching marriage and the ceremony.  There is a superb benefit for the viewer because the producer himself who hales from that part of the world provides a movie of great insight to the cultural contradictions in that society.  This is an excellent addition to my collection about foreign cultures.",1453939200,2,1534,4.861538461538461

7922669,3,B00004TJRE,I agree with Ghandi that it took a lot of courage to make this film dealing with two sexually taboo social issues like homosexuality and child rape.  The groom-to-be is an introspective young beauty while his pal is a flaming over-the-top/hot-to-trot drama queen who should have been given the opportunity to explore his homosexual cravings at the bachelor wedding party.  Sadly the quick sex tease between Farfat and the other erotic male dancer in that scene ends in violence and death.,1260921600,,488,5.012345679012346
7922670,3,B00004TJRE,"Please bear in mind this is a 1986 movie made in a Islamic country, dealing with child abuse in a totally macho-oriented culture.  That alone makes it daring.  At the same time, it exposes how sexuality, for this culture, is community-oriented; that is, young people marry because their families determine it is time for them to do so, whether they want to or not. In fact, the role of females in preserving tradition--whether as mothers or prostitutes--is quite overbearing.  What gets lost?
The possibility of a homoerotic relationship between the two protagonists--Hachemi and Farfat--whose unspoken feelings for each other are at the same time the force  gluing  the plot elements together, and the hidden, undeveloped subtext.  The ending is predictable in this cultural context: marriage for one, escape for the other, and revenge for both.  But it does not satisfy Western sensibilities.",1249948800,2,894,5.253521126760563

7922672,2,B00004TJRE,Appalling and boring. Lame and pointless. Nothing more deserves to be said about this pathetic movie.  I give two stars only for the cultural interest about Tunisian lifestyle. Period!,1132704000,4,184,5.344827586206897
7922673,4,B00004TJRE,"MAN OF ASHES / Tunisia 1986 (4 STARS)
14 December 2003: It isn't everyday that one comes across a film from Tunisia, but one that so deftly treats a sensitive subject and so adroitly displays all the element of subtle film-making is a greater rarety.  Man of Ashes is indeed a brazen effort for Nouri Bouzid, who needs to be applauded for so bravely confronting a sensitive subject within an Islamic society, while proudly presenting to the world intricate and ceremonious details about his culture.
* Mise-en-scene: I enjoyed the ceremonious and culturally exquisite staging of the wedding. I found several parallels that could be drawn between Tunisian culture and others that I am familiar with, and it was gratifying for me to note the bonds that unify us across culture and geography.
* I would have liked to see more of a progression in the relationship between father and son, which very quickly degenerated into as shouting match and then stayed. It would have been interesting to explore the father's motivations and understand his shouting within that context.
* I had mixed feelings about the figure behavior of the two leads because of their excesses in both directions. I personally thought that the protagonist over-did the withdrawal through trauma and his friend was way over the top with his expression of grief. But then these reactions are culture specific and who can pass judgment on the various ways in which people are prone to behaving in adverse circumstances.
* I also thought that the friend's not going all the way and exploring his homosexual side was a missed opportunity.
* The cinematography was surprisingly polished and subtle, and showed an acute sensibility both in the use of camera lenses which were used with great panache to alternate between objective narration and psychologically subjective exploration through tight close-ups, and in the choice of color palette which was diffused and earthy, yet rich with the texture and hues of Tunisian culture.",1072915200,28,1992,5.036363636363636
7922674,4,B00004TJRE,"From Nouri Bouzid comes this tale of a man soon to marry struggling with childhood memories of sexual involvement with his mentor. His best friend, who shares the same experiences, deals with his past in asocial ways. Our hero becomes depressed and fears he will not be able to perform as a man with his bride. Flashbacks fill us in about the exact nature of the trauma and place the boys at about ten years of age. Think of a mix between Nattlek and The Boys of St. Vincent. A Cannes winner.",973728000,17,492,4.358695652173913
