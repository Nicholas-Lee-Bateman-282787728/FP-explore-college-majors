7453274,1,B015XC88UI,"The plot: two young women are taking a road trip in a fast car while wearing mini skirts and boots. They drive fast and get extremely angry often, and drink lots of beer. A trucker doesn't like it when they pass him, and the rest of the movie is spent driving in and out of danger at high speeds. This happens on a road with no towns, houses, or crossroads for an entire 24-hour period. In case you're wondering, yes, it is a wholesale ripoff of Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"", only prettier and much less intelligent.

This film has been vastly misunderstood by people who expect the lead roles to be played by human beings. Not so here. The leading role is played by the control panel of a shiny red Ford Mustang. The range of emotion is complete: the wild swings of the tachometer, the steady plodding of the speedometer between 120 and 140, the beautifully scripted role of the gas gauge (a speaking part!), and the check engine light, which makes a dramatic appearance late in the film. The co-star is the grill of a semi truck, which is played with competent menace. I never found myself doubting its metallic motivation.

The human co-stars play minor roles. There are two mensa society members, young women who apparently have Tourrette's Syndrome and chronic rage issues. They are able to identify the truck driver who is harassing them on the strength of similar shoes alone, and then bravely smack a sandwich out of his hand in a diner. Shockingly, they are mistaken. There is some yelling and a bit of hysteria. I personally have no objection to profanity, but seriously, for the sake of variety, find another adjective! For some reason, these women are repeatedly surprised to see the semi truck on the lonely stretch of road from which no other roads diverge. They let it get ahead of them while lunching, and then can't BELIEVE they have caught up with it after driving at 140 mph down the road.

What happens to each of these characters is 100% unsurprising. But ***SPOILER***, you will be surprised and delighted at the resilience and determination of the lead actor (Mr. Mustang), who remains not only undented, but unscratched after being rear ended several times by a semi truck. This car has a future. The humans in this film, not so much.",1459555200,4,2255,4.660804020100502
7453275,1,B015XC88UI,"The best casting in the film was the red Torino Squire because it gave the only believable and solid performance in the film. Having owned one, I can attest it broke down a lot and spent a lot of time on the back of a tow truck. Mustang was completely miscast, however. There's no way it couldn't outrun that tow truck. Most of the movie looked as though it were only going 40 mph. So, do yourself a favor and skip this frustrating, poorly edited and executed film and watch DUEL (1971) by Steven Spielberg instead (which Wrecker copies various scenes from almost verbatim). So much to say . . . but not worth the effort.",1458172800,,621,4.362068965517241

7453279,2,B015XC88UI,"Two young women traveling from Washington to Palm Springs take a back road called ""Devil's Pass"" and unfortunately that was all I needed to know. We end up with a cat and mouse game with a wreaker hauling a Ford wagon vs a Mustang on winding roads. This lasts just about the entire film except for the lunch break. I was hoping for something fun like another ""Wolf Creek"" where the driver of the bad guy vehicle has some personality, an improvement on the genre. Nope.

8734851,4,B015XC88UI,"RELEASED IN 2015 (2017 in the USA) and written & directed by Micheal Bafaro, ""Wrecker"" is a road/thriller with elements of horror about two young women traveling through the Cascades who are targeted by a malevolent semi tow truck driver.

People give this movie the lowest of ratings just because its a remake of the Spielberg classic from 1971, albeit with obvious changes. The plot and a few scenes are taken almost verbatim from Duel (e.g. the trucker deceptively waving the girls to pass and the diner sequence) while some scenes are similar, but different (e.g. the cliff scene) and some are totally new (e.g. the cop sequence).

Thankfully, the movie has the same realistic tone as Duel without venturing into the cartoonish implausibilities of the Joy Ride flicks, especially the two over-the-top sequels. The BC locations (standing in for Washington) are magnificent; needless to say, great cinematography. I liked the way the girls aren't always babbling back-and-forth; there are several long quiet stretches, just like in real-life traveling.

Anna Hutchison is winsome as the main protagonist, but a little on the play-it-safe side, which ties into the distressing climax.  Andrea Whitburn plays the somewhat wild child and looks great (I KNEW what happened to her; its kinda obvious). Interestingly, the aging waitress (Jennifer Koenig) has a superior figure to both of em.

While Wrecker loses points for being unoriginal and a couple of awkwardly edited scenes, it should be appreciated by fans of Duel, Joy Ride (2001) and Breakdown (1997).

THE FILM RUNS 83 minutes and was shot in the Kamloops area of British Columbia, Canada.

8734855,3,B015XC88UI,"I watched this on Netflix it was on my list, didn't rent or buy. Not bad, it's like a ""Joyride"" female version thriller. What do people expect, it's a low-budget thriller. It had twists and turns and made me guessing what will happen next. I never saw ""Duel"", but may have to since it's good rating. I saw a person's review of ""one body count"" total in this movie?? How is that?? If you notice the beginning of the movie you have to assume the couple is you know what, since the demented is towing their station wagon vehicle throughout the movie. Next, the police officer was demolished when he pulled over Emily, and then Leslie who was found in the trunk which you can guess!! How was there a body count of one in this movie??? Not every thriller will have 5 or more deaths. The first ""Joyride"" 2001 movie the main characters survived. The other two Joyride movies involved few more gruesome deaths. At least one of the character's survived the deadly cat and mouse game. It's a what would you do in that situation movie. Moral of the story don't aggravate truck drivers!  Overall I felt it deserved a 3 out of 5.",1488240000,,1116,4.41747572815534
8734856,1,B015XC88UI,"Incredibly boring with a body count of one.

The movie has little to no action and just consists of two girls driving, arguing and then, on occasion, being menaced by an ""evil"" truck.

And I say ""menace"" because, when the evil truck is actually on-screen, it really doesn't do anything but harass the girls (honk its horn, drive up close, etcetera) and then depart. Rinse/repeat.",1466121600,2,379,4.815384615384615
