8123074,5,B000FII2AM,"I'm almost ""speechless"" as I try to describe this amazing DVD of ""The Georgia Mass Choir"" The introduction was given as various old songs put together for our encouragement!  Old Songs, etc. such as these need to be forever ""Present"" because, on a Down, Pity Party, Troublesome day, this DVD needs to be pulled out immediately! There is nothing old about the songs which I heard and the various Choirs and Soloist, were unbelievable!  Believe me, God's message through the many Songs which I  heard ""The Georgia Mass Choir Singers, can be a blessing any day!",1408406400,,558,4.791666666666667
