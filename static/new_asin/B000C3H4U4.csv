8187205,5,B000C3H4U4,The BEST title that Sub Rosa Studios has ever made !,1509148800,,52,3.8181818181818183
8187206,5,B000C3H4U4,This is not to be taken seriously... If you like comedy with horror then you'll dig this.  There are two sequels already out and they are just as funny... Grab a six pack and follow WIllie on his messed up killing spree.,1218931200,,220,4.238095238095238
8187207,5,B000C3H4U4,"Dead Body Man is probably the most sickest, twisted, dark comedy I have ever seen. The 4th Floor guys pull out all the stops and push the envelope as far as they can. It's one of those flims that you cannot take seriously. Eddie Benevich (Willie, the film's anti-hero) shines in the role..and you don't know wether you should hate him or feel bad for him. It's a really clever indie film gem that shouldn't be overlooked. Pick this up to tide yourself over till the much anticipated sequel, Dead Body Man 2 : Seperation Anxiety is released! Essential viewing!!!",1160611200,,561,4.62
8187208,5,B000C3H4U4,This movie was cRaZy in a good way. There was definetely a method behind it's madness. It was a unique story with some hilarious scenes. My favorite was the group session. Having a group of serial killers gathered together to talk about their problems definetley gets you thinking. Keep up the good work 4th Floor!,1142294400,,314,4.7272727272727275
8187209,1,B000C3H4U4,"Dead Body Man is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Period. Bad acting, total lack of plot and endless torture of women (the director obviously has trouble with females), makes this a total mess and a waste of time. It's not funny, witty or remotely enjoyable and feels like a fetish film masquerading as horror. And what's up with that Freddy Krueger sweater guys? Cmon! If you like movies that have a budget of the price of the videotape it was filmed on or have a thing for ninth grade dialog and teen boy fantasies of rape and torture, than this is the movie for you. the content is not offensive but the execution of it is. Pure crap.",1139270400,,643,4.322314049586777
8187210,5,B000C3H4U4,"Horror movies being my favorite genre, dark comedies follow right after. Mainstream flicks lack the guts that indy flicks like Dead Body Man offer up. I don't mean just plain blood and gore guts, but I mean content guts. This flick takes dark comedy/horror to whole new level thats not afraid to throw punches at just about anything. This movie succeeds by interweaving a complex tale of psychological angst while painting a canvas of richly textured characters that will not only disturb you, but make you land on your a#* laughing and questioning your own sanity at finding the subject matter funny. That's the beauty of this flick. It doesn't take itself seriously, yet it's magnificently designed to entertain the hell out you and doesn't worry about who it might offend.",1135641600,,775,4.923664122137405
8187211,5,B000C3H4U4,"If your tired of the same boring horror flick and want something exciting and new...

then this is the movie for you!

Dead Body Man offers a refreshing twist in Horror!!! The movie keeps you wanting more...on the edge of the couch dying to see what is going to happen next....let's just say it involved  group meetings, chickens, as well as ho's and selling meat!!

I can only hope the demented 4th Floor Pictures is going to offer a sequel!!! This movie is GREAT!!",1134259200,,466,4.511904761904762
8187212,5,B000C3H4U4,"A great movie that was sick, funny, and enjoyable at the same time.  You will laugh your ass off and at the same time be grossed out.  I loved the storyline, the script, and the actors.  No doubt overall a great movie!  Get a copy and check it out for yourself.",1133308800,2,261,4.0588235294117645
8187213,5,B000C3H4U4,"This is one of those b-movies that are truely worth getting.  The damn thing is so funny, I couldn't stop laughing.  If you like TROMA movies, then you'll like this crazy flick.  To be honest its 10 times better then a TROMA movie.  So, order your copy today and laugh your ass off.",1133222400,2,282,4.264150943396227
