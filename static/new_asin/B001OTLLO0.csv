8331453,5,B001OTLLO0,"I love trains. very educational. video was in great condition. well packaged. although I love train videos, I can find better things to do than sitting at the computer having to write a feedback.  I rate3d this video a 5 star and that should be sufficient enough.",1386892800,,263,4.595744680851064
