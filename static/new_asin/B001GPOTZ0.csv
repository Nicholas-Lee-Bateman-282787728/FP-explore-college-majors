8306579,5,B001GPOTZ0,"I have replicated Mrs. Kennedy's White House wardrobe in a diminutive scale. I researched hundreds of books, photographs and magazines for details on each costume. I ordered this DVD and got some great close-ups of her costumes worn in India and Pakistan. It was in color and I was thrilled. It also brought back wonderful childhood memories of the Camelot years in the 1960's. Great piece of history for a modest price!",1283731200,4,420,4.847222222222222
