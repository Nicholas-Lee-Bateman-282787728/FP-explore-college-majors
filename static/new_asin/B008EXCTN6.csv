8527197,4,B008EXCTN6,"I would really like to give this three stars, because the audio quality is uneven, and production, it could have been filmed entirely on an iPhone. The plus side is that you get to meet some very amazing artists across genres, where the musician lives on the road, and the road is relentless. This is a story of courage, and some who have played their cards will, Chris Smither being a prime example, have enjoyed a lifetime in the life as a recording artist, with and without labels. I discovered many artists with whom I was not familiar, and am now intrigued to discover more. Fundamentally, long on talent and story line, but short on production.",1435795200,,650,4.612068965517241
8527198,3,B008EXCTN6,"I liked the idea behind the film more than the film itself.  As a huge fan of many of the performers featured, I was excited to watch it, but in the end I wish it had just been a Peter Case doc.  His parts were the most satisfying and the rest of the artists (though I dug them) seemed like filler.  In the end this movie wasn't bad, especially if you like most of the artists in the film, but it lacks the artistic cohesion of a film like Heartworn Highways, which covers the same territory (little known singer-songwriters) but 30 years earlier.",1370995200,,547,4.29126213592233
8527199,5,B008EXCTN6,"If you like singer so g writer stories, this is for you. Got acquainted to some new ones via this disk",1368316800,,102,3.9047619047619047
8527200,5,B008EXCTN6,"Nearly 10 years in the making, Tom Weber's Troubadour Blues takes us on a journey about journeys. The road for these talented singer-songwriters is not a glamorous plane-hopping trip with thousands of expectant fans at every stop. For these artists, it's a drive, usually in a truck or van from town to town, playing for sometimes 50, 100, maybe more but not too many more. And that's part of what makes it so much fun. The kind of music performed by these talented folks is amplified (and not just literally) by the small venues they frequent where it might be swallowed up if they were playing at your local arena. You may not recognize all the names featured but you'll probably become a fan after seeing this film as it provides an intimate glimpse of them, both onstage and off, playing their songs, talking about songcraft, the road and most of all giving you an idea of what it's like to sing the Troubadour Blues.",1367798400,2,921,4.587878787878788
8527201,5,B008EXCTN6,"Not everyone is a superstar in the music business, but the troubadours featured in Troubadour Blues represent an important segment of America's ongoing musical heritage, and an important part of America itself. Tom Weber's film is a passionate work that should be viewed by anyone interested in the lives of musical storytellers. Highly recommended.",1358121600,,349,5.481481481481482
