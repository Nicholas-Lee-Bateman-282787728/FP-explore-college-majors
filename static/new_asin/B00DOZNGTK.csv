5838860,4,B00DOZNGTK,"I'm going to provide some details since there aren't any here. Scores are from that movie site. ;)

Catacombs - 1988 - 4.4/10 - A demon has been trapped in a monastery for 400 years, now a girl has gone there to study and accidently unleashes it.

Cellar Dweller - 1988 - 4.5/10 - A cartoonist's creation comes to life and kills him and now a new cartoonist revives the old drawing, bring back the monster.

Contamination. 7 (AKA Creepers) - 1993 - 2.0/10 - Radioactive trees attack a small town.

The Dungeonmaster (AKA Ragewar) - 1984 - 3.1/10 - A demonic wizard challenges a computer programmer to a battle of sorcery vs. technology and the programmer's girlfriend is the prize.

As far as I can tell, these movies are pretty much unreleased elsewhere and this is a good price for 4 not-so-gemlike flicks for those of us who dig our trash horror. I've seen them, they are trash, but fun. I could not find any specs but at this price we can pretty much assume full screen transfers. There will be 2 discs, 2 movies per disc, hopefully single-sided. I preordered, hope this gives all of you some good info.",1373846400,34,1107,4.487562189054726

5838862,5,B00DOZNGTK,"I can't completely recall the movie ""Catacombs"", but I do remember that it was one weird and wonderful, twisted and blasphemous little terror nugget. I have been waiting with great anticipation for it's DVD release, and hopefully rediscovery and appreciation, for a long time now. Several years ago when I met producer Charles Band, this was the one movie I asked about.

I have never seen these other movies, but they all have the potential of ooey, gooey, gory delight from the 1980's video archives. The images on the DVD are certainly provocative.",1373414400,9,551,4.924731182795699

5838921,4,B00DOZNGTK,"This is a decent collection of B horror movies with an 80's feel in a nice 4-pack for a reasonable price.

1. Cellar Dweller - If you like Tales from the Crypt type horror stories with a dash of humor you will enjoy this one.  The visuals are clean and the actors amusing enough to follow with interest through the whole movie. The monster is sufficiently creepy but the comedy throughout puts a damper on any sense of ""horror.""

2. Dungeonmaster / Ragewar - Neither title is particularly suitable for this fantasy flick which is like a low-budget Tron mixed with an even lower budget Time Bandits. That said, the movie is actually quite entertaining once you get past the title, and is a heavy dose of nostalgia if you enjoy 80's vintage computers and 80's hair bands.

3. Catacombs - Slow moving and with a very thin story, this movie works only because a few of the monks in the movie have interesting character quirks and the scenery.

4. Contamination. 7 - Probably the most stock ""horror"" movie in the whole set if you are looking for that sort of thing, but nothing particularly special.",1447200000,,1094,4.561224489795919

5838940,5,B00DOZNGTK,"What we have here are 4 films, 2 on 2, 1-sided discs. 3 of which are 'classic' films released by Empire Pictures. The other film is hardly even a cult classic (more on that later). I'll begin with 1988's Cellar Dweller...

CELLAR DWELLER (1988)

Plot: A comic artist dies in a fire, after his art comes to life. Years later the deceased comic writer/artist's house is turned into an artist's colony. A woman shows up to the place, to begin re-vamping her idol's comic book series. Soon enough her creations become a reality...

My Thoughts: Cellar Dweller is essentially a love letter to Charles Band and Empire Pictures in general. Throughout the film various posters for other Empire films can be seen, Re-Animator (1985), Troll (1986), Ghost Town (1988), etc. The film falls in the same vein of movies like Pumpkinhead, The Unnamable (which still needs a dvd release), and Rawhead Rex. It's essentially about a large demon-esque creature which runs amok. The creature design is fairly cool, the beast is identical to the Cat-Ghoulie from Ghoulies. There's also quite a bit of gore. The score is perfect and the film musters up some atmosphere as well as mood. The effects aren't that bad either. The performances from Yvonne Decarlo, Debrah Farantino, Brian Robbins, Jeffrey Combs, and Vince Edwards are fairly decent. Everyone else is relatively bad or clunky. The dialogue isn't too bad and the story is unique although it was later utilized in the Tales from the Crypt episode Korman's Kalamity. However, there's very little character depth although Robbins' and Debrah's characters are still likeable. Yvonne hams it up a bit, making for a fun villain. The film is short (1 hour and 18 minutes) and full of campy-fun.

FUN FACTS: Jeffrey Combs only has a cameo. John Carl Buechler directed the film and is a special effects wizard who worked on various films with various people including Roger Corman. He worked on other Empire films including Troll, From Beyond, and Terrorvision. Don Mancini wrote the film and he worked on all six Child's Play films.

THE DVD:
Cellar Dweller is paired with 1985's Dungeonmaster. Unfortunately it contains no special features.

Video: A fairly good transfer free of grain or other blemishes. However because it was straight-to-video at the start of the film a couple ripples are noticeable. Other than that it's absolutely fine, they go away quickly.

Audio: Glorious and crystal clear.

My rating: The Film: 3.5/5 stars Disc: 1.5/5 stars

Next up is...

DUNGEONMASTER (1985) AKA RAGEWAR

Plot: An brilliant young man's (Paul) girlfriend (Gwen) is captured by an evil wizard (Mestema; Richard Moll) who forces him to play a game consisting of 7 segments.
Segment #1 Stone Canyon Giant: Paul must face off against a giant statue.
Thoughts: The stop motion is fantastic and the segment is directed and written by David Allen (Laserblast, Day Time Ended). It's a fun but short trial.

Segment #2 Demons of the Dead: Paul battles undead knights controlled by an evil creature named Ratspit.
Thoughts: The makeup is ghastly but terrific. Ratspit is actually a Troll puppet from 1986's Troll. This trial was made by John Carl Buechler. This one's also fast paced and entertaining while being atmospheric yet tense. Although the dialogue is dreadful.

Segment #3 Heavy Metal: The awesome band W.A.S.P. holds Gwen hostage while Paul tries to save her.
Thoughts: I love W.A.S.P. the segment has a little bit of suspense and is fairly entertaining. It was directed by Charles Band!

Segment #4 Ice Gallery: Paul and Gwen wind up in a wax museum full of notorious figures from history including Jack the Ripper, the Wolfman, the Mummy, and Albert Einstein!?
Thoughts: This one is pretty entertaining and really cool. The makeup is awesome.

Segment #5 Slasher: In under an hour, Paul must stop a psycho from killing Gwen.
Thoughts: While it's an interesting plot, it's the weakest and dullest segment.

Segment #6 Cave Beast: Paul faces off against a rock throwing creature.
Thoughts: This is the shortest segment and it's fairly weak but amusing due to the monster.

Segment #7 Desert Pursuit: Paul is in a car race with some Road Warrior rejects.
Thoughts: While fairly amusing, this segment is also quite dull.

Final Thoughts: The film has its ups and downs. It begins well but the later segments decrease in fun and quality. Richard Moll gives a great performance while everyone else is pretty hit or miss. It's a mixed bag as the Mestema parts are good along with the first 4 segments. The last two segments aren't too bad but aren't that interesting either. Slasher is by far the worst segment and can be skipped or laughed at. The score is good, the effects are good, but everything else is uneven. The film is overall a fun campy good time.

FUN FACTS: I've got nothing.

THE DVD:
Dungeonmaster is paired with Cellar Dweller and its trailer is included.

Video: Really good and clear with only a tiny bit of grain.

Audio: Terrific

My Rating: As a whole the film: 3.3/5  Individual- Trial #1: 5/5, Trial #2: 4/5, Trial #3: 3/5, Trial #4: 4.5/5, Trial #5: 1.2/5, Trial #6: 2.5/5, Trial #7: 2/5. Disc: 2/5

Okay...

CATACOMBS (1988)

Plot: A monastery holding a demonic secret is re-opened by a priest and a schoolteacher.

My Thoughts: This was directed by David Schmoeller, who I like very much. He's made quite a few favorites of mine including 1979's Tourist Trap and 1986's Crawlspace. The film is actually not that bad although it suffers from uneven pacing and a few poor performances. Overall it's a decent effort with a good score and decent makeup.

Fun Facts: David has a cameo and co-wrote under a pseudonym. The statue sequence cost $5,000. Over the course of filming, the script was rewritten numerous times.

THE DVD:
Catacombs is paired with Contamination. 7 and has a commentary track.

Video: Great with no blemishes or grain.

Audio: Stellar.

My Rating: Film: 4/5 Disc: 3/5

OH MY GOD!...

CONTAMINATION.7 (1993)

Plot: Radiation turns plants into killers!

My Thoughts: This is a movie about killer plants, how could it have gone so horribly wrong!? First off it's directed by Joe D'Amato, one of my favorite Italian horror filmmakers. He brought us the classic Anthropophagous (1980) and the awesome Beyond the Darkness (1979). But then again he also made Troll 2! This movie was also advertised as Troll 3! When Joe cares, his films are decent but when he doesn't-they suck. At least Troll 2 is hilariously bad, this is just ugh. The performances are atrocious, the effects aren't too bad (sometimes), the score sucks, the writing is awful, and the pacing is dreadful. This film is extremely dull and boring. Its got a little gore but it isn't enough to sustain the rest of the film. This movie should be forgotten. I tried to sit through it, twice! I first saw it on cable a couple years ago and couldn't finish it. I gave it a second chance and regretted sitting through it again. It really doesn't belong in this set or in any set but it does-sadly.

Fun Facts: NONE!

THE DVD:
Paired with Catacombs with no extra features.

Video: Not too bad, although it doesn't matter because this film sucks.

Audio: Decent.

My Rating: Film: (my first negative) -1.5/5 Disc: 1/5

OVERALL THOUGHTS: This is not a bad set by any means. Dungeonmaster, Cellar Dweller, and Catacombs are well worth the purchase and it's nice to see them all finally get a DVD release. However Contamination. 7 should be avoided, I love Shout Factory but Jesus there are much better b-movies that deserved the spot instead of Contamination. 7. All in all it's highly recommended.

I had dweller and catacombs before this came out.

I always knew catacombs as CURSE 4, as the copy I had was titled that.

Unfortunately Cellar Dwellars picture still looks like its from the cellar.

My old bootleg dvd is the SAME  exact picture, shame.

And too bad good ol Jeff is in the movie for like 1 minute only.

I totally reccomend this release because its SO cheap!, and has 4 good

Or ""decent"" horror shlock to enjoy on a rainy day with a beer and spliff.

I won't tell you the plot for all these films, grab this release and enjoy.

Contamination 7 film so dark couldn't tell much about it, except tree roots were killing people because of nuclear waste.  Bar far, not what expected.  3 Stars only because of 2 movies I enjoyed.  I do not for the life of me understand HOW anyone can record something that dark and actually offer it for sale - at ANY price.  $3.00 would be too much.

5839010,5,B00DOZNGTK,"I bought this mainly for Cellar Dweller, which I've been waiting forever to come out on DVD.

But for fans of eighties horror, I feel safe in saying this is a 'must have.'",1390348800,9,325,4.344262295081967
5839031,1,B00DOZNGTK,"Maybe one star is unfair, because I like the packaging and the deal (for 5 bucks, c'mon), but these films are really bad in a very bad way! ""Cellar Dweller"" is the most ignorant movie I've seen in ages, and I usually like the crap when it's layered over the quality. But really, this is a silly story! Not that ""The Dungeonmaster"" is much better, because it's very dark and disturbing and very late 80's. It does have the nudity that so many guys are commenting about here, but to me that didn't make it worth the purchase alone, geez! ""Contamination .7"" is the most interesting film conceptually, but it too is pretty much inept. Lastly, there is ""The Catacombs,"" a weird film that features some bizarre imagery set in the underground world of a monastery. It's not any more ridiculous than any other title here, but it's filled with cheap shocks and no heart--and I can't forgive it!
Overall, I love the Scream/SHOUT DVDs, and I missed these weird titles back when the VHS tapes first emerged from the gates of Hell. But man, if you are looking for tolerable movies...go elsewhere. This is really pathetic. I am sorry if I offended the lovers of these films, but I have to tell it like it is.",1389225600,5,1194,4.506912442396313
5839032,3,B00DOZNGTK,"I really only bought this set for Dungeonmaster starring the great Richard Moll.  I remember loving this film in my childhood.  I was really let down by the other films in this collection.

Dungeonmaster:  Ahhh, a childhood favorite as I said.  Sadly it had been 20+ years since I'd last seen it, and it has not aged well.  Basically Richard Moll is the ""Dungeonmaster"" and he kidnaps the hero's gf unless he can pass 7 tests (each test has a different director).  Some of the sequences were hit and miss, and I was saddened by the recycling of the vehicles from Metalstorm: the Destruction of Jared Syn.  3 out of 5.

Cellar Dweller:  A long lost John Buechler film.  Somehow I was expecting better.  What I got was a lame rubber monster that we never fully see and a storyline about he kills people in comic strips that magically appear on the heroine's desk.  2 out 5.

Contamination .7:  Wow.  This movie was bad.  Yawntastically bad!!!!!!  The acting was HORRIBLE!!!!!  Not so bad it's good, just horrible.  Basically a movie about killer roots.  1 out of 5.

Catacombs:  A by the numbers demon story taking place in a monastery.  The only thing I can say about it was the acting was above average.  3 out of 5.",1389225600,,1216,4.493087557603687
