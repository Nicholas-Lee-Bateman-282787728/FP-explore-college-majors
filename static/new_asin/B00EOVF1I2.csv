5931842,5,B00EOVF1I2,"I enjoyed it.  The documentary follows several dancers over the course of the summer ballet intensive program.  You get to see clips of classes, interviews with the girls, insight from staff, silly shenenigans in the dorms, and finally, what happens to each of the girls in the end.",1445126400,,282,4.854166666666667

5931846,1,B00EOVF1I2,This item is not playable on a computer or other electronic device. Only an actual DVD player connected to a TV. That would've been handy to know.,1427328000,4,146,4.444444444444445
5931847,4,B00EOVF1I2,"This is another in the fine series of dance-relared documentaries from First Run Features.  While the central story follows nine young girls - ages 11 to 14 - who are attending the four week ""Summer Camp"" at Canada's Royal Winnipeg Ballet - after being chosen from 7,000 candidates to join the 70 students to try out for a year of professional dance education - it is less about competition (as most documentaries are) then whether they are interested after they see the hard work needed. The girls are not competitive, they are there to learn and do their best. Because of this, the viewer is less interested in seeing who is accepted and who isn't then watch these young girls interact with each other in an away-from-home atmosphere. Like all documentaries, the director did not know how it would end when she started the project, which was partly funded by  Manitoba and Canadian film tax credits.

I was surprised - and a bit disappointed - that only girls were followed and interviewed for this film. There were quite a few boys in the class and it would have been interesting to hear their thoughts - at a young age - on a future in the art of ballet. (Interestingly FRF will be releasing a new DVD early in 2014 titled ""To dance Like a Man"" about two boys competing for a ballet role in Havana, Cuba.)

There are interviews with the girls away from their parents - and there is a cultural mix of nationalities - and the parents themselves. I think this film would be most useful to any family that has a girl - or boy - who is starting ballet or dance class at an early age. This film gives a pretty go picture of what to expect.

The 80 minute film comes with no bonus features except previews of other dance films in the FRF catalog.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5931849,4,B00EOVF1I2,"Interesting seeing such young dancers competing for a place in a ballet summer school.
Obviously a huge commitment financially for their parents and for the youngsters to be away from home in a big city for the first time.
I wouldn't watch it again, but I was glad to have the opportunity to learn what goes on.
It would be nice to know how many of the dancers continue into the profession.",1485129600,,390,4.430555555555555

5931856,1,B00EOVF1I2,"I'm surprised no one's commented that a young girl was told her feet are put on wrong, her hips don't work right and her neck is too short. I guess body shaming is the norm in dance. I lost so much respect for this discipline when I saw that segment. I couldn't even finish the program.",1483747200,2,286,4.125
5931857,4,B00EOVF1I2,I loved this documentary. It gave me a real understanding of what people go through to learn and perfect this art and get ahead. It really delved into the individual situations and had me rooting for them all to succeed.,1483401600,,220,4.525

5931860,5,B00EOVF1I2,"I was once a ballerina as a child, but got bored and quit. Something I always regretted. I say this to preface why I am obsessed with movies about dance, in particular ballet.

I absolutely loved this movie. More over, I enjoyed the passion the teachers used while teaching the craft with words of encouragement. So refreshing! (Compared to ""Dance Moms""). It's a little heartbreaking to watch the ones that did not get the news they were hoping for. It was also interesting to watch the parent's reactions and actions. (Which ones want the child to choose for themselves - which ones are wanting their children to fulfill the regrets of the adults.)

I liked the juxtaposition of how the girls could be so serious in technique class one moment, concentrating to look like perfect professional ballerinas, to the next moments where they are giggling, gossiping, and pigging out on candy reminding you, these are truly just little girls.

The viewer is reminded towards the end how cruel the ballet world can be when one student is rejected for her body not being ""built"" correctly... (as if she really had a choice as to how long of a neck she would be born with?). But you cannot blame the movie for the standards that exist in the world of dance.

If you truly love the world of dance, I think you will enjoy this film.",1482364800,5,1320,4.604255319148936
