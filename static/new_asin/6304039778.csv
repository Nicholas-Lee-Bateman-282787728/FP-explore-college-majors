763884,1,6304039778,This movie was pure garbage.  I enjoyed the first movie and thought part 2 would be a cool sequel.  Boy was I wrong!  Everything about this movie ...!,1013472000,5,150,4.285714285714286
763885,1,6304039778,"Not only is this movie a bad sequel, its a bad movie. Worse that Highlander 2, worse than Plan Nine from Outer Space, worse than (dare i say it?) Battle Field Earth. This is unquestionably the epitome of bad movie. I mean there are some movies that are so bad their good, but this movie is so bad it just bad. And yes its that bad. The first Lawnmower Man was an excellent movie with potental. The movie had a intesting plot that questioned ethics and morality. It was a sort of modern Frankenstin. Lawnmower Man 2 (Jobe's war or Beyond Cyberspace) is the exact opposite of the first. Its almost a spoof of the fist move. This movie should be in the comedy section because there is absolutly no way you could take this movie seriously at all. Jobe, who was a cyber-god at the climax of the first film has been downsized to a mad computer hacker in a wheelchair who for some reason wants to enslave everyone in cyberspace. At the end of the first movie, Jobe's body was destroyed and he became a computer entity. He escaped onto the internet and caused every phone in the world to ring to show the world his power. It was a cliffhager ending! Really intense! What was next? How would he be stopped now? Lawnmower 2 changed the ending of the first movie by making Jobe for some dumb reason go back to his body and become dumb again. The acting is horrible (especially Patrick Bergin) and in the end Jobe becomes his old dumb self and all is forgiven. An why is Peter only a few years older in the far future? Matt Frewer is no Jeff Fehey. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!",988070400,15,1557,4.299319727891157
763886,3,6304039778,"This film has nothing to do with King's universe. It is pure science fiction and action. It is only the dark side of virtual reality. It shows how, when virtual reality gets in the hands of businessmen and of a now completely crazy Jobe, only looking for power and revenge, it is the most dangerous invention in the world, because it would give to only one person complete power over the whole world and everyone.

It fails, only because Jobe is more powerful than the businessman, and because Jobe only wants to regenerate humanity by destroying its materiality and turn it into pure spirituality by making them cross forever from real reality into virtual reality where he, Jobe, would be the new Messiah.

The film does not have a moral really because it does not have an ethical core but only action and indicidual interests. It shows though a certain future for a certain younger generation : these young escapees from the world will live on the fringe and in the margin of the world, exploiting all its technical possibilities but only surviving like so many free bloodsuckers on the body of society.

This marginalization of a section of the younger generation is already underway and is the result of a world where you can only integrate, that is to say assimilate and become obedient subjects, or a world where you have to rebel and hence step outside.

Our modern world less and less accepts rebels in its heart and shrine. To be free you have to rebel and hence become a parasite or a dead corpse. As Camus used to say : we rebel therefore we are. And this is the lesson of this second film. A beautiful lesson about our inhumane world.

That aside I really saw nothing wrong with this movie at all! It simply picks up exactly where the first one left off with amazing results! I enjoyed this movie's simplicity,special-effects,action scenes(ie the 4 teenage kids riding on bikes with guns attached shooting at the bad guys and of course the sword fight between Patrick Bergin and Matt Frewer which was the most awesome one ever filmed next to the Star Wars Light Saber fights of course) and simply that I can see this sort of thing with cyber business all over the world actually happening! Now I know that we already can do that online but this is different. It was also cool to see the actor from another science fiction film ""Lathe of Heaven"" playing slimy businessman Jonathan Walker!

764005,4,6304039778,"Dr. Bejamin Trace creates a brilliant device which allows unhindered access to all sources of electronic information: banks, hospitals, etc. When he questions their motives, the corporation that funded his research take him to court and claim the device as their own. Since Trace -- the only man who can make it work -- takes off to who-knows-where, the corporation pulls a crippled Jobe from the wreckage of the first movie and offer him a job.

Several years down the road, Jobe's secret work has lead to a future that's advanced on the surface, but hides a sad underbelly of poverty and unemployment. Jobe's nearly cracked the networking device, but needs to find Trace for the last crucial bits, so he contacts his old friend Pete, who's cruising the streets with a gang of homeless hackers. Pete's overjoyed that Jobe is alive and tracks the nomadic Trace down in a desert home free of modern convenience, only to learn that Jobe has plans of his own for the networking device. Plans that go far beyond the sharing or stealing of information.

First off, this film is cheap. It was made on a nonexistent budget and skipped out of the theaters before people even knew it existed. But, that aside, it works.

The sets and costumes brilliantly portray a Blade Runner-style future clearly divided between the haves and have-nots. The casting is perfect, from Patrick Bergan's portrayal of Trace as a man shoved around so long he finally ran away from the world, to Eli Pouget as Jobe's doctor who falls for her patient's seeming innocence. But the rowdy gang of kids steal the show. Heck, even Frewer, who I normally don't enjoy, does a decent job.

Farhad Mann deserves credit for a well constructed story with plenty of twists and turns that moves at a perfect pace. And more credit for bringing that script to life on such a meager budget.

There's really only two problems I have with the film.

First, Jobe doesn't gel with the original movie. Frewer's portrayal is of an anarchistic goof along the lines of Batman's Joker, whereas Fahey played him as a twisted Buddha who opperates on a mental level beyond those around him. The performance works, though, if you just approach it as a different character.

Secondly, the VR scenes with actors in front of blue screen suffer when compared to the dated but beautiful cgi of the original. They still look fairly good, superimposing the actors over sprawling cybernetic vistas, but I guess I just miss the gimmick from the first one.

I like this movie. I know many out there don't, but I do. It's a rare sequel that tries to take the story off in a new direction.",1147046400,2,2617,4.698689956331878
764006,1,6304039778,"...I truly enjoyed the first Lawnmower Man film, it was imaginative and had a plot that really drew you into the movie, and the ending left your spine tingling (the birth-cry of Jobe, all the phones in the world ringing...), so you can imagine how I was excited to watch the sequel in '96...

If you've seen this film, you can also imagine my disappointment, as what could have been a truly great film was turned into the most worthless garbage sequel ever produced!

It has almost nothing to do with the original film, and all of a sudden, we are living in the ""world of the future"" which featured the kid from the first Lawnmower Man film, who is only a few years older - how'd that happen?

I thought sequels had hit a new low with the gosh-awful Highlander 2 (planet Geist, anyone?), but Lawnmower Man 2 has truly surpassed it by leaps and bounds.

Not only the worst movie ever made, but as the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons would say, ""Worst. Sequel. Ever."".",1119916800,4,967,4.415730337078652
764007,3,6304039778,"Matt Frewer who plays Jobe in this lamebrained sequel got his start on the trendsetting ABC TV series, MAX HEADROOM.  While critically acclaimed, the series died a quick death; this must be Frewer's revenge.  He takes over the role initiated by Jeff Fahey in the original, and there are times when his manic performance almost makes it work, but overall, I think I would have preferred Fahey back in the role.  In the original, at the end of the film, Fahey's body had pretty much disintegrated and we assumed he achieved his goal given the telephone ending.  However, the sequel opens with Jobe's body being found in the rubble.  Since we've moved into the age of teen oriented movies, the film gives us a ragtag squad of computer geeks, headed up by Austin O'Brien, the only original cast member who returns in his role of a now more mature Peter.  Still don't understand how Peter could consider Jobe a friend, after what he did in the first movie, and this penchant to make Jobe more a victim undermines the success of this film.  Overworked Patrick Bergin, who has never impressed me with any of his performances, has no action hero presence; Ely Pouget (who portrayed Maggie Evans in NBC'S disastrous Dark Shadows remake) is the only performer who seems to occupy her character.  The saving grace is the wonderful special effects which continued to elevate this film as it did the original.

First off, the acting was horrible.  The only actor in this movie that was in part 1 was Peter (Jobes little friend).  The first movie had a mysterious and low budget feel to it, which I love, and part 2 has a fluffy and hollywood feel to it, which I absolutely loath.  Also, The connection between part 1 and part 2 was very weak.  What's up with the telephone rings?  That was a great idea, why didn't they keep that?!

7859510,1,6304039778,"Note: This review was initially written before I'd seen the 1992 movie ""The Lawnmower Man"" which this 'sequel' tries to follow...
(PLEASE SEE THE ADDENDUM LIST BELOW)

I want to make one thing perfectly clear before I start this review: I have never seen the original 1992 Pierce Brosnan/Jeff Fahey film the entire way through. That isn't because I don't want to, but simply because I've never gotten around to seeing it in its entirety. I caught part of the original movie on Cinemax or HBO or something about ten years ago but something kept coming up and I only saw bits and pieces of it. This would probably prompt you to ask: ""Then why are you writing a review of the critically scathed sequel to a movie you've only seen the last twenty minutes of?"" The answer might surprise you, but it's because I'm a ""Max Headroom"" fan, and when I saw the trailer for this movie recently, I took note that Matt Frewer (the titular ""Max Headroom"" himself, also Moloch in ""Watchmen"" and all around great actor from Canada) was in this cyberpunk movie playing a similar character to Max, I said: ""Alright, I'll watch it, why not?"" So I got a copy of the DVD and here we are.

Virtually everyone on this page has given this movie one or two stars out of five, citing it as a terrible film, a terrible sequel, a terribly made piece of so and so. Again, I've never really put my full attention to the first movie, and from what I understand the first movie is revered by the cyberpunk community as a classic for being the first of its kind and that it was really something special, again, that's cool, I get it. But I watched ""Lawnmower Man 2"" only knowing bits of the end of the original ""Lawnmower Man"" and basing this entire experience around my enjoyment of the 1987 sci-fi soap opera ""Max Headroom."" So, as long as we're all clear that I've never seen ""The Lawnmower Man"" (Part 1) then you should be able to understand where I'm coming from with this review.

""Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War,"" AKA ""Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace"" (I'm not sure why some people call it that as no prints of it I've ever seen use the second subtitle.) begins a few minutes after the ending of the first film. The simple Lawnmower Man, Jobe, is rescued from the debris of the laboratory or... whatever (didn't see the first movie, I don't know what it is) and is put through physical rehabilitation by a corporation who hopes to repair his mind and body with virtual reality. The opening scenes are pretty good, but there's a major off-set to them in that they're shown completely inside a completely square box frame-- I was watching the widescreen version of the movie and the DVD does have the option to watch the 4:3 ""pan and scan"" version, but this extremely extended ""flashback"" is contained entirely in a small box frame. This is annoying, but thankfully brief as once the exposition is over, it goes to a full 2:40:1 ratio. Max, I mean Jobe, is reconstructed enough after the cataclysmic events that cripple him and becomes a new pet project of a corporation called ""Virtual Light"" run by Jonathan Walker who wants him to build something called ""The Chyron Chip."" Jonathan Walker is a well liked and reputable businessman in this world, but if you're watching the movie, he'd might as well have a Nazi swastika stamped on his forehead because it's painfully obvious that he's the embodiment of evil.

We then cut to ""Los Angeles: THE FUTURE,"" where we meet the movie's only other returning character from the first film, Peter, who is now grown up and living in a furnished railcar in an abandoned subway tunnel deep beneath the gritty streets of LA where he and his friends enjoy hacking into cyberspace to play games. They all hack in at once and proceed to fly around through the air like in ""Peter Pan"" (probably hence the character's name) and titter girlishly at how splendid everything is in cyberspace. Then there's a cyber explosion and Peter and company get on Troncycles and zip around what looks like a recreation of the Vietnam War when who should appear, but Jobe! Peter doesn't recognize Jobe at first, because in the previous movie he was played by Duke from ""Psycho 3,"" and in this one he's played by M-M-M-Max Headroom, so Jobe uses the magic of cyberspace to materialize a big lawnmower in front of him and then Peter recognizes him. Jobe explains that the cyber-scape is dying and he needs help from someone named Doctor Benjamin Trace, and that if Trace will come visit Jobe he'll help him build the Chyron Chip.

Meanwhile Jobe in the physical world is working at the Virtual Light Institute, where Jonathan Walker gives some government suits a tour of the place in order to get federal funding for their efforts which are, as they put it, something along the lines of: ""building a cyber-scape in cyberspace and bringing the entire world online."" Are you sensing a pattern, here? Cyber, cyber, cyber, everything in the future is cyber. Okay, again, that's fine, we press on. Jobe is helping the VL build this cyber-scape, but he's also very depressed in the real world, as his legs were ripped off by whatever happened at the end of the first movie and he tells a scientist that ""this is her world,"" and that ""my world is... in there."" Referring to cyberspace, again. He also seems to have a god complex which, believe me, builds over the course of the movie and culminates in a big way. In the 'real world' he's a simple quadriplegic, but in cyberspace he is a god and his overall intentions seem to cast in shadows.

Peter goes to find Doctor Benjamin Trace, who is living as something of a hermit away from the high tech squalor in a nice cottage in an oasis in the desert outside LA. Trace is Native American, and at first I was a bit worried they were going to pull the old ""Magic Indian"" card, make him a sort of stereotypical Native who speaks broken English and casts weird spells but this movie, in an oddly pleasant twist portrays Doctor Benjamin Trace as a withdrawn, well read man who has neo-luddite views and prefers the simplicity of connecting with the quietness of a world without computers who happens to be Native American but is extremely in touch with his culture and proud heritage, yet he does not spend the entire movie (or any of it, for that matter) discussing the ""spirit of the buffalo"" or any other sort of harmful Native American stereotypes you'd expect in a movie with the so-called ""Magic Indian"" ('The Lone Ranger' comes to mind.).

Doctor Trace reluctantly agrees to come with Peter to meet Max-- I mean Jobe, who has, for all intents and purposes become Max Headroom. He's silly, goofy, he swims around cyberspace making pop-culture references and acts like a generally lovable loon. Until he flies into a homicidal rage and tries to kill everyone when Doctor Trace refuses to help him understand the Chyron Chip's ""Egypt"" protocol and sends a speeding subway car into the abandoned tunnels headed straight for Peter and company's home. But Doctor Trace saves the day with his hacking skills and thwarts the twistedly eccentric Jobe's plans-- for now.

I could go on synopsizing the plot, but I think you get the drift. I actually took twelve pages of notes while watching this movie, so forgive the wordiness of this review. But, if you're one of the three people in the world looking to buy a copy of ""Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War"" then you're probably still reading this, which is good because now we're gonna get weird.

This movie is good for all the wrong reasons. The plot is terrible, yes. The acting is awful with the exception of Matt Frewer who seems to be the only person invested in their role, in fact, Frewer seems to be having a lot of fun with the role while everyone else in the movie trudges through it like they have gastroenteritis and a bad inner ear infection and the script is so nonsensical that I actually got lost several times watching this choppily edited movie that has really great effects for 1996 but suffers from a bad case of meddling executives and budgetary issues.

This movie is a warning, not to the people of today as much of the people of 1996. Someone, somewhere in a studio back in the mid 90s saw the internet boom going on and said ""Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not going to end, well."" Now, look at us today: We're all glued to our smart-phones and tablets, laptops, computers, anything that connects us to the internet-- to cyberspace. This movie features all the ugly materialism of today in a metaphoric time capsule that shows how the the things we now have are actually just part of a much larger system of control. For instance, in the movie there's a scene where the bad guy, Jonathan Walker tells Jobe that every idiot in cyberspace is giving him their private information, whether they know it or not, they're just giving it to him. He's using it to exploit them, maybe expose embarrassing secrets or overthrow people he doesn't like all because they just mindlessly gave him everything by signing a contract. We do the exact same thing, today, FaceBook, Twitter, whatever-- everybody everywhere complains about privacy rights on the internet when they're freely handing their rights to Mark Zuckerberg or the people who run Google or the Twitter people and what's worse is unlike in the movie, people in today's world do it deliberately and with a smile.

At first, I thought this was just a coincidence, but I've watched the movie five times, now and it becomes increasingly and painfully more clear upon each viewing that this movie is a cry from the halcyon days of simplicity telling us that we need to stop going so fast because we've turned technology into a religion, just like how Jobe becomes the savior of cyberspace and claims that by following him the material world will fade away and only cyberspace will remain-- it's already happened and we let it happen. Now, whether or not the writer of the film meant this intentionally or subconsciously is up for debate. I'm not saying he was sitting at his word processor, twiddling his mustache and adjusting his top hat planning on taking over the world, I think it was a lot more simple than that-- I think whoever wrote this movie saw what the internet was becoming, had a passing thought about how it might make humanity dumber or even destroy us all and kind of unknowingly built his movie around it.

I mean, the devices they use to enter cyberspace in this film are headsets called ""EyePhones."" I'm not making that up. If you don't believe me, go watch the film, they call the devices used to enter cyberspace ""EyePhones."" This movie came in 1996, the same year Steve Jobs got back into Apple Inc. and became the CEO and about ten years later came the ""iPhone,"" which we use to access the internet-- there's a good chance you're reading this review on an iPhone. Yeah. How does that feel? Now, I don't know if Steve Jobs saw this movie and that settled somewhere in his brain and years later he'd revolutionize the way we talk on the phone, but I do think it's eerily prophetic.

Take for example how Jobe's behavior is so erratic and eccentric. He swims around cyberspace, humming the theme from ""Jaws"" making funny jokes one minute, then slightly more offensive jokes, then he starts cussing people out when he doesn't get his way and chooses to get angry instead of use his seemingly infinite intellect to delineate his problem. This is very much the way we all behave online, our avatars, our usernames, even me in this review, I'm being biased, I'm writing from a stance that's emotionally heated. But Jobe is the nth degree, he's the worst of the worst, he's like the kind of person who swings a baseball bat at a mailbox drunkenly from the window of his car at four o'clock in the morning on a Thursday just because he can. He's a kid with a plaything and he's getting too big for his britches and this is very much reflected in our post ""Wild West"" internet world. People get carried away online, arguing with each other for hours in comment sections about things completely unrelated to the original subject much the way this review has gone.  I'm no angel, but I'm certainly not a complete fool.

And that is why I give ""Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War"" five out five stars. It elicited an emotional reaction out of me to write this extended review crying out hopelessly to people who have no idea that they've already become one with cyberspace and that they're truly lost. It makes me sad that this movie didn't do better at the box office because if it had, I might not be sitting here at all right now, having to write about what a cautionary tale it was and how nobody listened.

Final thoughts: The movie has excellent special effects, both practical and CGI but suffers from choppy editing that was apparently made against director Farhad Mann's will and with the exception of the always excellent Matt Frewer, the acting is terrible and rushed as is the writing and ultimately the direction. The DVD has nothing on it except a theatrical trailer, the ability to watch the movie with subtitles on for those hard of hearing and some obsolete DVDROM-Online stuff that I couldn't access. So, pick it up, I implore you. It's still a better movie than ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.""

UPDATE: July 3, 2014 - Addendum 1

I have now seen the original 1992 Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey movie ""The Lawnmower Man,"" the DVD of which I found at a flea market and instead of writing an extended review of that movie, I figured I'd just make a quick note of my thoughts on that film and the contrast between it and its 'sequel.' The original movie, ""The Lawnmower Man"" is a modern classic, it's a far superior film to ""Jobe's War,"" and a far superior film to many films of the era in general. I'm not sure how they came up with the plot of ""Jobe's War"" after the events of the finale of the first film tied everything so neatly together making the events of this ""sequel"" impossible.

The only reason I'm going to retain the five star rating is in hopes that by encouraging people to see this misguided 'sequel' that they may redirect their attention to the original ""Lawnmower Man,"" which is, as I've stated, a modern classic and probably the first film of its kind-- ""The Lawnmower Man"" presented several themes layered in metaphors and allegories, wrapped in enigmatic storytelling and masterful direction which makes it probably the best movie of 1992. This 1996 sequel is heavily misguided and a missed opportunity at something that could have been great. But if you can't get Jeff Fahey to reprise his role then you've got a serious problem with your script and need to reexamine your priorities. Honestly, now that I've seen the original ""Lawnmower Man,"" it's become number two on my top ten list of favorite movies and this, THIS, I'm no longer sure what to make of this ""Jobe's War"" fiasco.

UPDATE: November 7, 2014 - Addendum 2

As stated in the first addendum, I've now seen ""The Lawnmower Man"" and in accordance with this film's title, subject matter and affiliations with that far superior film, I can say that ""Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War"" (or ""Beyond Cyberspace,"" whichever title this movie is going by...) is not only one of the worst sci-fi movies ever, but possibly one of the worst movies ever in general. They couldn't even get Jeff Fahey back to reprise his role, and while I do like Matt Frewer a lot, I'm surprised he agreed to this film which completely ignores the ending of the original movie.

I can say without any doubt in my mind that not only is this a bad sequel, but it can't even be considered canonical to the first film. It takes place in ""the future"" and yet the only returning actor's character, Peter, has aged about five years, where the technology in the film has gone up by about three hundred years (by 90s standards). They make a pitiful attempt to allude this film to whimsy, incorporating elements from ""Peter Pan"" which come off as annoying rather than cute and where there was room for potential the filmmakers instead filled the movie with poor attempts at making a mainstream sequel to a fantastic sci-fi film and failed so badly that the only person in the movie with any fame today is still reduced to minor character roles.

""Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War"" is so bad that it ruined the careers of everyone involved with the exception maybe of Matt Frewer, it is a film that not only shouldn't exist, but can't exist within the canon of the original film. The director of this movie was once a reputable commercial director, but is now forever condemned to have ""Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace"" on his resume and I wouldn't hire him to direct a commercial for local car insurance. The only way to watch this movie is if you're so extremely inebriated that you find it amusing, or put it on your TV when you want guests at a party to leave.

So in conclusion, the moral here is that if you live long enough, chances are someone is going to say the word ""cyberspace"" in your presence, that is in the context of say: ""What about that whole 'cyberspace incident?'"" To which you should always reply with: ""Oh, please. Can't we just get 'Beyond Cyberspace?'""",1402876800,,17174,4.608567691301504
