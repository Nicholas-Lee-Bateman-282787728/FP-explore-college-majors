2830690,1,B000Q66Q10,"Musical performances in this documentary can be rated from decent to excellent. However, their mapping to the different periods of Rachmaninoff's life is often meaningless. The worst parts are the visuals of modern Russia, that look like mockery of Rachmaninoff's love to his motherland.",1205539200,9,287,5.545454545454546
2830691,5,B000Q66Q10,"This is a very nicely produced story of Rachmaninoff's life and work, with charming home-movie footage and period pictures. It really brought home Rachmaninoff's musical genius and also his sadness because he could not return to his beloved homeland. The musical pieces are played and sung by excellent artists who understand and convey the beauty of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Romantic style.",1204416000,9,388,5.483333333333333

2830693,5,B000Q66Q10,"This video reviews the life and music Rachmaninoff. It is touchingly and movingly done, interspersing first-rate performances of the music with extraordinary film clips of Rachmaninoff at home. Anyone who loves this music must see this magnificently done documentary.",1194307200,39,267,5.871794871794871
2830694,5,B000Q66Q10,"This film by Tony Palmer shows performances of Rachmaninoff's works by Valery Gergiev and others. It includes scenes of a Rachmaninoff museum, and places where he lived in Russia. It recounts historical events, his travels and concert tours, and interviews with some of his grandchildren. Best of all it shows many home movie segments where Rachmaninoff is cavorting, smiling, and showing an intimate and surprisingly lighthearted side. Sir John Gielgud gives voice to Rachmaninoff's letters and reminiscences about his life. I don't see how anyone could watch this wonderful film, and not come away loving Rachmaninoff more than ever.",1193097600,54,635,5.424242424242424
2830695,5,B000Q66Q10,"This is an interesting story about the Life of Rachmaninoff.  It does drag a bit at times but on the whole it is worth several viewings.  The music is wonderful and beautifully played by top artists.  If you love Rachmaninoff, this is a vital addition to your collection.",1190764800,6,271,4.604166666666667
2830696,5,B000Q66Q10,"I saw this film in a commercial-ridden broadcast on the Ovation Channel and enjoyed it, so I expect the commercial-free DVD to be even more attractive.  I'm not always a fan of Tony Palmer's bio-pics--like all biographers these days and as his title suggests, he portrays his celebrity subjects as exploited victims, no matter how successful, acclaimed, privileged, and controlling they really were.  Here, though, ""sorrow"" emerges not from villainous parents, impresarios, lovers, capitalists, or fascists, but from the composer's life as a victim of history.  Specifically, crushing critical hostility toward his early works and then, just as he settled in as a renowned master composer, the Bolshevik revolution and permanent exile from his beloved homeland.  This story is told compellingly and quite objectively, with stirring musical examples and without melodramatic re-enactments.  No sign either, thank goodness, of snooty modernist musicologists denouncing Rachmaninoff's music as ""kitsch.""  Some of the photography of the Russian countryside with its birch forests is stunning.  I didn't expect that consummate non-Russian John Gielgud to serve well as the voice(-over) of Rachmaninoff, but he turns out to be ideal and very droll, capturing the composer's dourness, frustration with bustling Western society, and nostalgia for the old country and the ancestral estates.  Music-lovers and Rachmaninoff-lovers, you ought to see this film.",1186617600,121,1448,5.733644859813084
2830750,5,B000Q66Q10,I have performed and taught Rachmaninoff compositions for all of my life; so this film was especially meaningful to see the places where he lived and composed.

2830753,1,B000Q66Q10,"There are so many romantic and inspiring stories about Rachmaninoff; his love for his cousin that continued for many years despite the Russian Orthodox Church's refusal to allow them to marry and their eventual and enduring marriage, his nervous breakdown and the therapy that resulted in his most famous work the 2nd Piano Concerto (my favorite piece of music).  But this film picked one rumored, short term sordid affair and blew it all out of proportion and missed the whole essence of his life.  It wasn't enjoyable, enlightening, or informative.  I was so disappointed.",1429747200,6,574,5.085106382978723

2830783,5,B000Q66Q10,This was a very interesting movie about the life of just about the greatest composer that ever lived.  His life was most sad and his music portrays that sadness.,1377302400,,161,4.551724137931035

2830785,5,B000Q66Q10,"A Harvest of Sorrow tells the difficult but privillaged life of one of our greatest composers,Rachmaninoff.  He was a true Russian at heartand chose the music of simple people to writehis themes.  Mostly piano music to be played sometimes with full symphany.  His music to me, moves your feelings to the top of the register.  Some of his pieces are very hard to play while others are very simple to follow in singing or playing one type of instrument.  I enjoyed this film very much and the music is a bonus for all to enjoy.  I reccomend this film to all types of people who like Russian music.",1364774400,,595,4.462962962962963
2830786,3,B000Q66Q10,"Interesting bio of Rachmaninoff. Loved the music, of course. Too much focus on the symphony conductor, but the black and white stills, with Sir Gielgud's narration were wonderful.",1364169600,,179,5.428571428571429

2830788,5,B000Q66Q10,"If you're a big fan of Rachmaninoff's music and the country of Russia, you'll love this dvd video.  It was surprising how young a man he was when he composed some of our favorite music.  Seeing Moscow and St. Petersburg filmed in the early 1900's was impressive.  You'll also hear how
he and his family fled by train, north to the border in the dead of winter and traveled by cart and sled to Sweden to avoid the revolution.
His emigration to America explains his extensive schedule as a concert pianist in order to earn a living. This dvd was sent to me from Sweden by way of the U.K. to Maryland - a modern miracle of Amazon on the internet and expeditious postal service.  The movie is extremely well done.  Is it a MUST SEE, CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT item?  NO, not really.  BUT, it's still great and I plan to view it many times again as the years go by.  I have a similar one about the life of Russian pianist S. Richter and I feel the same way.  If you love the piano and the music of Rachmaninoff, you'll never regret having purchased the Harvest of Sorrow (Sergei's sorrow at having to leave his home country during the revolution.) The movie also inspired me to visit his grave in Valhalla, New York. I'm a big fan. Some day I may go there.",1353024000,,1246,4.268085106382979
2830789,4,B000Q66Q10,"I enjoyed the film a lot. The history of one of music's top icons in history. Too bad there were no complete pieces of Rachmaninoff's music, which would have made the DVD a lot more enjoyable. And the DVD lasts 102 minutes,  so I suppose there is room for more music.
On the negative side, the voice of Sr. John Gielgud, while appealing, is not adequate, it is not christal clear as to stand out from behind the music and other scene sounds. Sorry.",1351814400,,448,4.333333333333333
2830820,5,B000Q66Q10,"Tony Palmer is a master at the medium of mucsic documentaries.  I learned a lot about Rachmaninoff as man and musician from this film. The combination of the music, images, and historical footage makes this documentary outstanding.  My only criticism is that I wish he had provided a translation for segments of the film.  Other than that, I love this film, and will be purchasing more of Tony Palmer's works.",1337644800,,409,4.814285714285714
2830821,5,B000Q66Q10,Absolutely fabulous film on one of the greatest Russian pianist/musicians of the 20th century. I am now going to use it as the center piece for a two-week class I am teaching at Principia College in the summer of 2012.  Highly recommend!,1322438400,,237,4.642857142857143
2830822,3,B000Q66Q10,"At the end of this film the credits display, ""Rachmaninoff's Letters and Other Reminiscences Spoken by Sir John Gielgud."" This is an ambiguous statement that implies that the reminiscences are Rachmaninoff's, which they are not. Sir John follows a carefully-wrought script which holds the narrative together quite well, but like many documentaries, it is a combination of truth and fantasy. Many of the remarks sound like things the composer MIGHT have said, or perhaps WOULD have said. But there were (for example) two separate mentions of the composer's relationship with Anna Lodashenskaya, which explained frankly who she was and her role in the First Symphony. The symphony's dedication was simply to ""A.L."" and the composer, to my knowledge, never spoke to anyone about this for the rest of his life and certainly never revealed the meaning behind this dedication. He buried this episode from his early years completely, only referring to it in a mysterious and entirely musical fashion, as a direct quote of the symphony's main theme, which he inserted--disguised no less--at the end of the first movement of his Symphonic Dances, which was significantly the LAST work of his life. There is no question about the impact that this young woman had on the composer, but the entire story was discovered by biographers long after the composer's death. To imply that these words of explanation came from the composer's mouth is a gross misrepresentation. The film is very well done, but viewers should know that much of the narrative material is fiction; some is undoubtedly fact and quotation from letters, but there is absolutely no way to tell which is which.",1318291200,18,1663,5.095238095238095
2830823,5,B000Q66Q10,excellent story about a great pianist/composer. Best classical music for the 20 century. Russian music at its best ever. Pictures and history were well done in this video.,1315526400,,171,5.142857142857143

2830825,3,B000Q66Q10,"The voice of Sir John Gielgud alone made this DVD worthwhile for my money - plus some fascinating raw footage of this 6ft. 'scowl' and a few of the piano shots.  But I was sorry that a man of Tony Palmer's caliber should bow to Hollywood-style gimmicks. The grotesque close-ups of Gergiev were particularly irritating and did a disservice to this great conductor. Why not a view from a few feet away for Heavan's sake, which would have much more effectively enhanced the drama of his interpretation. And the passe 1930's gimmick of soft-focussing the orchestra, bathing them in fuzzy light - hello! Maybe this is what film producers think today's public still wants, maybe it is! Ironically, in Rachmaninoff's own view of America: 'It is all about money.'",1259798400,10,755,4.852713178294573
2830826,5,B000Q66Q10,"This documentary is invaluable for the insights into Rachmaninoff the composer and family man offered by the home movies of the Rachmaninoff family, period shots and clips of places where Rachmaninoff lived or was otherwise engaged, the comments and insights of Valery Gergiev and his obvious affinity for the music as evidenced by generous samples of his performances.

Besides Gergiev, we are treated to some superb playing by the likes of Mikhail Pletnev, Alexander Toradze, Valentina Igoshina, the singing of Dmitry Hvorostovsky and others.

Somehow missing is any mention of Rachmaninoff's sojourn in Dresden, that beautiful city, capital of the Kingdom of Saxony that was senselessly (and arguably, criminally) incinerated by the RAF in 1945. Rachmaninoff and his family lived there for 3 years in a rented house on Sidonienstrasse, from the end of 1906 through 1909. He moved to the beautiful Saxon capital to allow himself time and space to work without interruption, and also because of its proximity to Leipzig and its musical life. He much admired the Gewandhaus and its conductor, Arthur Nikisch, whose Tchaikovsky 6th Rachmaninoff described as ""... a work of genius. One cannot go beyond this"". In Dresden, where he admired the opera, he composed such important works as the Piano Sonata no. 1, the gorgeous 2nd Symphony, the opera Mona Vanna (alas, never finished), some important piano transcriptions and others.

Some may find the breaking, whispery, raspy voice of Sir John Gielgud too distracting, even annoying. I was reminded of Robert Frost's poem ""An Old Man's Winter Night"". Maybe Rachmaninoff sounded that way in the last days of his life due to terminal illness and the finality of the realization that he was never going to see his beloved Russia again. Some may even approve of Gielgud's doom and gloom approach to speaking for Rachmaninoff. But he was not ""6 foot 2 of Russian gloom"", as Stravinsky once described him. This is evident from the footage presented and from the vivid testimony of his surviving relatives like that of Sofia Satina, his niece, seen towards the end of this documentary.

He once saw a performance of Franz Lehar's ""The Merry Widow"" and declared it ""a work of genius"" and that it made him ""laugh like a fool"". Likewise he laughed silly at Jewish and Armenian jokes. I think that there is a natural inclination in certain societies, particularly a society centered on slick entertainment and trivial pursuits, to commingle the concepts of seriousness with gloom. Rachmaninoff was a serious person, not necessarily a gloomy one.

Sofia Satina also mentions the fascination that church bells held for Rachmaninoff, whose sounds can be spotted in many of his compositions. As a child, he would go to listen to the church bells in the city of Novgorod, near his family home.

True, there is an element of gloom in some of his music like in the ""Isle of the Dead"", but Rachmaninoff has always been misunderstood (even underrated), especially by music critics. In the 60's and 70's I read more than a few music reviews that were dismissive of his music, presumably for being too musical (i.e., not modern). This one, from the 50's is typical:

<<Technically he was highly gifted, but also severely limited. His music is well constructed and effective, but monotonous in texture, which consists in essence mainly of artificial and gushing tunes accompanied by a variety of figures derived from arpeggios. The enormous popular success some few of Rachmaninoff's works had in his lifetime is not likely to last, and musicians never regarded it with much favor. Eric Blom (ed.) Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. (London: Macmillan, 1954) vol. 7, p. 27.>>

That is when I learned never to listen to music critics again.

Maybe these days when noise and cacophony pass for art and music, the melodies of Rachmaninoff may be an incongruity or anachronism. At the end of this documentary, Gergiev reminds us of the important contributions to music made by Serge Rachmaninoff with his piano playing and his melodic output and reminds us that it is not easy to create such long melodic lines, some as long as one minute, that manage also to hold the listener's interest and how these resolve into new melodies like doors that open to new wonders. Like in the Hermitage museum, I would add.

If you cannot stand the voice of Gielgud, then turn down the volume when he speaks, but this documentary is a must for all lovers of the music of Serge Rachmaninoff.",1239926400,23,4511,4.9629139072847686

2830828,4,B000Q66Q10,"I agree with the person giving the DVD a one star rating and talking about mockery of the ""motherland"". While the performances are good and I WOULD buy this DVD again, the footage of modern-day Russia is very misplaced and does not add, rather detracts from one trying to get a sense of Rachmaninoff's Russia and I feel should have been left out. Footage of Rachmaninoff himself however has been extremely interesting to see.

I did not find the narration to be very informative. In conclusion, while the historical footage and the performances are excellent, modern-day Russia footage and narrative are disappointing and left me with a feeling that something was missing. I would've liked to learn more historical facts from Rachmaninoff's life, rather than just reading of his letters/diary, which are not always revealing. That's not to say they are uninteresting, just don't create a full enough picture.",1215648000,10,908,5.093959731543624
2830829,5,B000Q66Q10,"The Harvest of Sorrow is such a compelling DVD, that I have had guests over to watch it on several occasions. All of them have enjoyed it, and have remarked on its quality.
  The dialogue mostly follows Rachmaninoff's own letters. Family pictures and news footage give authenticity. Sir John Gielgud actually becomes the older Rachmaninoff as he narrates. The best part of the DVD, though, is the way the music is handled.
  There is no slipshod insertion of themes to grab the listener's attention (without actually getting into the music) as one might expect. The works are performed, if not in their entirity, in longer sections, and correspond to the filming. Gergiev and the other musicians speak to the hearts of listeners.
  One cannot help but appreciate the historical background covered in the composer's lifespan -- late 19th century to 1943. This DVD is perfect for the person who appreciates accuracy and artistic ability in filming. It is also a tribute to a great composer, and a great man.
