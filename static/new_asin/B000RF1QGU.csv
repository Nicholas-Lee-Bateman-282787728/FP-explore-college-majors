8200271,5,B000RF1QGU,"A superb, tricky little documentary that has its say with economy, clarity, and even a little suspense.  Saying more about the narrative of the film would spoil the viewer's surprise and pleasure, so I'll withhold details: I'll only say that it's both inventive and insightful.  I recommend it highly.",1462147200,,301,5.122448979591836
