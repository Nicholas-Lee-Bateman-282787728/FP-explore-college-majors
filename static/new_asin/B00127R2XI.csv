3080335,3,B00127R2XI,"This is going to be one confused review.

There are things I really liked about this series, and things I really hated. Overall, not a completely horrible way to spend your time, but I'll have to leave a lot of the comparative stuff to folks more in the know than me. (Specifically the shows this show is said to steal from.)

Likes:

Vivid, saturated colors
Fairly well integrated use of 3D and 2D animation
Complex scripting

Dislikes:

Dumb stereotypes GALORE
Bait and switch plot points

A whole lot happens in these 13 episodes. And I admit, sometimes it made very little sense. I know too the plot is similar to another, better known, series.

The ham-fisted English actors (who sound like 1990's Saturday Morning action cartoon) and the at times wrong-headed English dialogue make this a ""Japanese Language Only"" title.

The homoerotic elements are WAY over the top in the English. The voice work of the ""bad"" guys in the Japanese language track didn't suffer from broad, almost slapstick stereotypes.

Like all series, the final episode had lots of reveal, and I have to say I didn't really appreciate or care too much about the resolution of the story arc. I'll give you an idea of what you have to look forward to:

A animalistic male lead who speaks perfect Japanese/English, but has the social skills of a baboon (even running around on all fours and sniffing out everything from hurt feelings to laser beams). Oddly, none of the other folks in his initial group of friends show any of these odd traits, pointing to weak writing.

A female lead who is shrill, childish, and more than a little incestuous.

Her oh-so-pretty (and even in the Japanese over-the-top) brother. Who is as pompous as he is talented.

Assorted stereotypes -- the ""wise"" commander who in this guise seems to do little but spout plot points and drivel; the asexual female commander; the pompous blowhard of a administrative leader; the self-described 'bad luck charm' of the elementals who seems to feel better about herself only when it serves the plotline, only to have her slip back into her funk as soon as things settle down; and two pre-teens who seem mostly to be there for comic relief.

I could bore you with the overall plot, something about a battle that took place 12,000 years ago between Shadow Angels and who knows what. You've got angels, vampires, and Gods. All battling out for the few remaining humans (who are either living their lives as normal, or living in refugee camps, or trapped inside these strange flying soul suckers (that grab bodies too) depending on the mood of the writers at that given instance. The city nearby is either destroyed, or full of folks.

The lack of continuity is one of the more debilitating aspects of the show. The other is the leering sexuality. Virtually all the characters appear naked during the 'Aquarion' transformation sequences -- because obviously forming a giant fighting robot is the exact same thing as having sex. But it is worse than that, at times the show pays way too much attention to the pre-teen girl's underwear and what's barely contained by them.

The rather obvious crush of this girl on her sempei is downplayed, where the situation between one of the Angels and one of the male elementals is anything but. But this too is played for the squirm factor.

The extras are alright, mostly consisting of obvious promotional items that would have aired on Japanese TV. I learned more about the plot in thirty seconds of one of the talks than I got from watching the actual show.

But all this is mote if you really need your anime buzz, and this is the only think in your DVD player.

If you find something else, or could at least explain what the heck is going on (and why I should care) let me know.",1208131200,,3757,4.691019786910198
3080336,4,B00127R2XI,"Typically I prefer the american science fiction animation compared to the japanese ones.

This was is an exception - I really enjoyed watching this anime series - the story line is that there is a Aquaron (a super 'Transformer') which has woken up after 12000 years of slumber and we have all kinds of elements trying to control it.

Animation quality is superb - a mix of classical animation with digital animation.  The only aspect of the anime which I do not like is the dialogues - which at sometimes seems very distorted/broken - I am not sure if it is because of the translation or  if it was originally intended to be like that.",1208044800,,635,4.495652173913044
3080337,5,B00127R2XI,"This is a great series with a very compelling storyline. The ""Legendary Mechanical Angel Aquarion"" is very reminiscent of Voltron, but the space/futuristic setting gives it a fresh twist.  This is an excellent example of well-done science fiction anime.  With reincarnation, advanced technology and aliens all coming together in the mix.  A lot of time is spent developing relationships between characters and the action scenes are pretty amazing. The background for the story is revealed a little slowly and the first few episodes are a bit confusing, but it is cleared up before you make it to disc 2.  The animation itself is top notch and quite beautiful.  The characters are appealing to look at and the voice cast does a good job.

However, I would not recommend this show for children.  There are some sexual overtones, particularly when the characters are ""merging"" during battle. The only thing that bothered me about the show is the implied incestuous relationship between Silvia and Sirius (sister and brother). However, this didn't ruin my overall enjoyment of the show.  This series is very similar to Evangalion, but I'm hoping the ending will not turn out to be as philosophical.

I can't wait for volume 2 of this series and I really wish I could find a release date for it somewhere!",1208044800,2,1300,4.926605504587156
3080428,4,B00127R2XI,"Sousei no Aquarion is a giant robot show, but creator Shoji Kawamori has labored to make it as novel and original as possible. Like the venerable ""Getta Robo,"" there are three smaller ships that make up the robot, and the order in which they combine determines the powers of the completed machine, with three variants possible. However, in this case, the abilities of the pilots also provide additional powers to Aquarion Mars, Luna, and Sol.

It's a fun series, and there are a few good belly-laugh moments right around the middle of the series, before the tone shifts into a more serious tone. The music is quite good, and the quality is high throughout. There are also a few bonus features, such as tv-length featurettes concerning the production of the show, and one commentary track by the American voice actors. All in all, a good show, and a great value at this price, as the same DVDs in Japan have two episodes per disc, and go for about $30 each volume.",1235952000,,963,4.631578947368421
3080429,5,B00127R2XI,"Long ago, I was a Jazz snob who realized that popular music was also full of great music, and eventually, after listening to a lot of bad music and some good, I found artists that I really love--so now I'm a popular music, R&B fan and have almost completely stopped listening to Jazz.

I am also a big film fan, and somewhat of an anime fan but only of the greats like Miyazaki. And since I lived in Japan for many years I thought I should check out some of the less aclaimed anime as well.

If you have a mild interest in Japanese popular anime, this is a good place to start.  It's also a good series for people who are trying to learn the language and want to get the sound of it in your ears.

For language learners I recommend watching it with subtitles or with English voiceover the first time, then watching it again and again in Japanese with or without subtitles.  This method really helped me gain fluency years ago, before I lived in Japan, and the spoken Japanese on this video is clear and plain enough that you should be able to pick up a lot of common phrasing from it.  I found that when I already understood what was being said, listening to the Japanese and picking up some of the language was a lot easier (Same goes for watching the news or a live action film).

BOTTOM LINE: A good series for those who are mildly interested in anime, popular Japanese culture, and language learners.",1234915200,2,1404,4.315589353612167
3080430,4,B00127R2XI,"Filled with twists and turns, Aquarion does its best to tell a fun story that touches audiences emotionally. While unlikely to convert a wave of fans that need to see more, the twenty six episodes of this series don't feel like wasted time either. While it will rarely be described as `great', it remains a mech anime worth watching once.",1231977600,2,338,4.65
3080431,2,B00127R2XI,"Aquarion is ok as it goes, but not really what I want from anime. The animation is good quality and I guess some younger viewers would find the story entertaining, but it's not too original, though. There have been other movies with the same plotlines.
The problem for me with Aquarion is that it's for younger audiences. What I'm looking for in anime is mature, sophisticated, intellectual philosophical themes with cool graphics and being willing to be sexually explicit (but non-gratuitous) if it's appropriate.
I'm sick of the entertainment industry knuckling under to the establishment censors who want to keep compelling art from the market. What we need is a production company and distributors who are willing to put out really cutting edge, sharp stories and content and be willing to ignore the heat from the religious and conservative wackos when it blows up.
Blood+ Plus is an example of anime that I love, but even that doesn't satisfy my craving for the explicitly erotic. I'm still waiting for what I really want, and I'm sick of society repressing really cool stuff.",1230681600,,1082,4.950549450549451
3080432,5,B00127R2XI,"to a very interesting Anime series.  Aquarion is based on an ancient legend of a great hero/robot called Aquarion.  The story starts with various candidates that are vying to fly the famed hero and only a certain number will make it in.  Also depending on which 3 heroes for Aquarion a different formation or type of the robot will form.  Its also interesting because the people's emotions tie into it heavily as far as the overall power and function of the robot.

One candidate named Apollo is one that starts out as a rough and tough kid in an area that has decimated by an ancient and very powerful foe.  He, his friend and a few other people are staying alive just barely.  When the foe makes another attack on the already devastated city, i won't tell a whole lot more.  It will ruin things for those interested.

The story itself is pretty involved between the various characters.  It also has its moments of comedy and fun mixed in between.  Overall, Aquarion is an intersting anime series mixed with robots, powerful humans and enemies and a solid story that should keep all who chose to watch interested and leaves things open for the 2nd part of Season 1.",1223942400,2,1166,4.5576923076923075
3080433,2,B00127R2XI,"I am a Shoji Kawamori fan and an adult swim geek, and admit that this was not as killah I'd wanted. Beautiful work that sure didn't rock me to continue.

Extras on the third disc were, sorry to admit, no big deal.

Overall, the same old same old: Teenaged mechs and ancient monsters that are back to rule the world, so the good kids suit up and... Wait, Didn't Bill Murray do that in GHOSTBUSTERS?",1219363200,,397,4.28
3080434,3,B00127R2XI,"Aquarion or Genesis of Aquarion is the product of Shji Kawamori, the man who created Vision of Escaflowne as well as much of the Macross series.  Aquarion is yet another giant Mecha series that ran for 26 episodes on TV Tokyo in 2005.  This boxed set presents the first half of the season, 13 episodes on three DVDs.  Aquarion combines traditional 2D aniamtion with 3D animation taking over during the mecha battles.  The look is seamlessly rendered and simply dazzling.  The battles between the giant war machines are the highlight of each episode.

Aquarion has drawn unflattering comparisons to Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Certainly the themes and plots are similar, perhaps a bit too similar:  Global Cataclysms, using teenagers piloting Mecha to battle beings known as Angels... Kawamori certainly won't win many points for originality but this sort of copying of plots goes on all the time in Anime and Aquarion can stand on its own.

The ""Great Catastrophe"" has killed two-thirds of the world's population and awakened the Shadow Angels from a 12,000 year hibernation.  The Shadow Angels subsist on the life force of human beings called prana.  The Shadow Angels harvest the prana by capturing humans with giant machines guarded by mecha known as Cherubim.  To combat the Shadow Angels, the organization called Deava recruits special teenagers known as Elements or Element users.  They are trained to pilot three advanced warcraft known as Vectors.  The three Vectors can then merge together to form Aquarion.  Aquarion has several different forms it can take on with each Vector becoming the lead depending upon what form they merge into.

The Elements are a diverse lot.  There is the snobbish and elitist Sirius and his younger sister Silvia; there is soccer star Pierre; friendly but bad luck-prone Reika; and Apollo, the orphaned, feral-like young man whose incredible abilities astound his fellow trainees.  Apollo may, or may not be, the reincarnation of the great hero Apollonius, also known as Solar Wing, who helped defeat the Shadow Angels thousands of years ago but is still loved by Toma, the leader of the Shadow Angels.

Each episode has the same basic outline.  The first half has the students generally training with Deava commander General Fudou or the other commanders.  This is the time we get to explore the personalities of the main characters.  Silvia is the reincarnation of Celiane, Apollonius' lover many millennia ago and this leads to all out verbal and physical battles between she and Apollo.  She cannot believe that he is truly her reincarnated lover.  This constant bickering does become tiresome after a few episodes and thankfully other characters are explored in depth as well.

The second half of each episode has three of the team responding to a threat from the Cherubim soldiers and merging to become Aquarion.  While merging, the three members all experience what can only be described as a sexual orgasm of pleasure.  This is a bit weird and one would think HIGHLY distracting in the midst of a battle.

Aquarion's visuals are stunning!  The mech battles are earth-shattering and the 3D animation brings it all right into the viewer's lap.  In almost each episode Aquarion has to find a new way to defeat the Cherubim as the enemy mechs are constantly adapting to Aquarion's attacks.

Aquarion is enjoyable although the familiar pattern of each episode can get boring after a while and you can't wait until the next mecha fight begins.

3080435,4,B00127R2XI,"I've always been a sucker for post-apocalyptic tales.  The Mad Max franchise was fun, and a good case in point of the world gone badly wrong.  AQUARION starts out with this theme, brings in the fan-favorite idea of coming robot sections into a bigger, giant robot with different forms/functions, and layers in lots of action.

Considerable thought has gone into the apocalyptic world as well.  The Great Catastrophe brought about the end of the world, and brought back the Shadow Angels, a kind of vampiric winged race that sucks the life force out of the victims.  It's creepy stuff with a great backstory and good visuals.",1219276800,,624,4.849056603773585
3080436,5,B00127R2XI,"Aquarion is a very fun anime.  The characters are interesting and slightly unpredictable, which is good.  The action sequences get a little repetitive for me, but they are still pretty good quality and generally enjoyable. THe art is very pretty. One of the reasons I like it is that it does not seem to be written with only 14 year old boys in mind.

The whole DVD series is of a very high quality and include a good English and Japanese language track and subtitles.  The picture quality and sound quality are very good.  The packaging is also nice.  I hate spending money on things that seem like they will fall apart.

Overall, a very good anime and a very good product.",1217894400,,674,4.475409836065574
3080437,3,B00127R2XI,I wasn't sure what to expect from this. Its decent quality but formulaic. Very formulaic.  The series tries to get by on looks but without innovation why bother.,1216252800,,161,4.75
3080468,4,B00127R2XI,"While the characters were a little difficult to like, the beginning and ending are a little muddled and chaotic and the story wasn't the best I've seen; the series managed to keep me entertained enough that I would watch the second season if it were released here. And really, with my track history with this genre I'd say that's pretty high praise. Recommended.",1214092800,,362,4.761904761904762
3080469,3,B00127R2XI,"Although I am not an anime fan I had once watched an anime series created by Shoji Kawamori which led me to order this set as Kawamori has also created this series. However, this was not at all interesting for me - very confusing story line and many characters but not one could hold my interest. Transforming robots are really not my cup of tea!

Maybe it gets better towards the latter part of the series but I will never find out as I could not watch it past the first 3 episodes.",1213833600,,483,4.193548387096774
3080470,4,B00127R2XI,"Awakened after 12,000 years, creatures known as Shadow Angels are harvesting humans for their life energy on a post-apocalyptic Earth of the near future. An organization called Deava is humanity's only chance for survival as it recruits and trains young pilots to fly its Vector planes, which, in the right hands, can be combined to form the super robot Aquarion. But special individuals are needed for such a job, and one who seems sent right out of ancient prophecy is a half-wild street boy named Apollo, much to the chagrin of the other recruits. His most contrary new friend is the beautiful Princess Silvia, who is sure her older brother Sirius is the true hero of legend they have all been waiting for. Through the course of the first 13 episodes which make up this 3 disc DVD set, we follow the recruiting of young Apollo, discover the secrets of his past, and watch as the characters' personalities and relationships are revealed and develop. There are also some cool CGI mecha fights that are well blended with the traditionally animated characters.

Now, you're probably thinking that the last thing the world needs is another Anime about giant robots piloted by sassy teens. Well, you could view Aquarion as just another of those, a total copycat of things that came before, or you could view it as the culmination of the dream. Sort of an ultimate Anime giant robot show. Though I'm not as well-versed in previous big robot shows as I should be, I'd wager this one has some of the best visuals ever. And, while it doesn't have the gorgeous Asuka Langley, it certainly has its share of Anime hotties (which is the main reason I dabble, very lightly, in Anime). This one also has some unique qualities that probably make it not so appropriate for the youngest viewers. For example, Silvia is pretty much in love with her brother, and I'm not exaggerating at all. They've been led to believe they are reincarnated lovers, and she is all for the idea. Besides that, when the young pilots combine their ships to form the Aquarion robot, they do something called ""merging"" which is meant to be some sort of spiritual connection but produces a pleasure that is unquestionably implied to be orgasmic. In fact, there's one whole episode that plays specifically on the comparison.

Overall, the show grows on you with each episode as you become more and more involved in the characters and the story, and as it feels less about the robot fights and more about the people. Though, one can only imagine where it is going without having seen it already. This set is a good start. Whether or not the show continues to be good I have yet to find out. I'm interested in seeing more though. This set comes with some nice extras. You get inserts, including a really cool plastic card, and on disc 3 there is an interview with the director, a Q&A with the director and voice actors from the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2005, 4 informative clips about the machines of the film, textless versions of the opening and closing songs, and a bunch of Anime trailers. Written and directed by the renowned Shoji Kawamori and presented with dubbed or original language audio and English subtitle option, I do recommend this to anyone looking for a giant robot anime with an interesting story and satisfying visuals.",1213833600,,3302,4.730902777777778
3080471,3,B00127R2XI,"I cannot say that I really liked this series, the premise was interesting, although the production often seems to get confused, inevitably leading to the viewer's confusion (might have benefited from reading Vogler's The Writers Journey). Each episode seems very formula in nature, at least for the first two disks, in that the team must master a new skill or aspect of their teamwork to defeat the latest beast of the Shadow Angels, and while they always reach the point of mastery and defeat the beast, they always seem to fail to save any of the innocents.

Much of the series confusion lies in the plethora of main characters, at last count I had it somewhere over twelve, and while half can be relegated to supporting characters, that still leaves about a half dozen to vie for the viewer's attention. Add to that the confused sexuality of early to late teens with pseudo-incestuous sibling devotion, homosexual undertones, heterosexual overtones and weak innuendo, and you have a fairly baffling stew (by the way, the nudity cited in the TV-MA rating is all Barbie doll nudity, nothing most 5 year olds have already seen). Throw in the typical mysticism of anime, techno or not, and the viewer can easily go into overload.

On the positive side the visuals, if you can get past the characters, are very appealing, as is the sound track. If anything keeps you watching it is the animation; at widescreen on my 52"" screen with the 5.1 surround sound, I was enjoying the ride, even while my subconscious was puking over the items noted previously.

Bottom line, there are better series out there, if given the choice I would have reset the clock and passed on this experience in favor of others. This is a middle of the road anime series in my opinion. P-)",1212796800,,1759,4.723127035830619
3080472,4,B00127R2XI,"But being exceedingly Japanese is not a bad thing necessarily.  :)  I do have to question, however, whether a western audience would appreciate it, though.

Japan loves giant robots.  That is no secret.  They also love teamwork, romance, woven plots that extend across hundreds of shows...

Here, we see something of a synthesis between Evangelion and Escaflowne, but beyond that, we see culture stretching all the way back to Japan's first giant robot animes.

It is a little difficult to explain succinctly, the amount of ""Japanese-ness"" (or at least pop-robot-anime-Japanese-ness) present here.  Just because you like Evangelion does not mean you'll like this!  Even if you liked Escaflowne, you might not.

One thing I can promise you, however, is that if you're interested in Japanese culture, and interested in seeing what they see, and are a scholar like myself, you will enjoy it, at least, from that perspective.

All the social motifs of friendship and teamwork--everything from this to, say, kendo, which is where it first became practice to shout the title of your ""attack"" as you executed it.

This is a peculiar form of entertainment from our perspective.  If you're willing to accept that, and experience it, I welcome you to.  It is also somewhat of a commitment, a rather long series.

So caveat, emptor.  Read all the reviews (not just mine!) and think before you hop in.

As far as the animation, it's excellent; the character designs are fun, the dialogue (in Japanese at least!) well written and recorded (there were a few lines I found especially captivating and poetic, which I paraphrase--""Time and distance are products born from an uncertain heart"").

After the first few episodes, actually before the first episode even concluded, I was almost certain it would receive a five-star score.  Its particular culture, however, and all that comes with it, as well as the somewhat plodding nature of the story, reduce the rating for me.  Others might be even more critical.  I have not perused other criticism written on the show.",1211328000,2,2050,5.023738872403561
3080473,2,B00127R2XI,"I started watching this show a couple weeks ago, excited with the idea that this was coming from the creators of Macross; from the very beginning I thought this was nothing but a copy of Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE). As a fan of the Evangelion series, it was obvious to me that many of the ideas presented in Aquarion were copied directly from NGEvangelion. I then decided I'd give Aquarion a chance and watch it over as this could have been only a first impression thing.

Wrong.

The story pretends to be original but truth is, a lot of the ideas presented in it are carbon copied from Evangelion, just to list a few examples I can think of right now:

1. Both stories are consequence of a ""Great Catastrophe"" (called ""Second Impact"" in NGE)
2. The title itself, ""Genesis of Aquarion"" (vs. ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"")
3. Aquarion has to fight against the ""Dark Angels"" (called simply ""Angels"" in NGE)
4. In both series an element/pilot has to synchronize with the mechas.
5. Both have a mysterious character in charge of the operations of a secret organization, in Aquarion, Commander Gen Fudou will even strike the same poses as Gendo Ikari in NGE.
6. Aquarion uses a lot of the symbology also used in NGE (for instance the ""Tree of Sephirot"" also known as the ""Tree of life"")

With all these facts if you watched NGE you pretty much know what to expect from ""Aquarion"". The story isn't really that compelling and I am not interested at all in seeing how this ends. Characters need serious development; it is hard to believe that these brats are humanity's last hope of survival. There are 2 characters (Silvia and Sirius) who are brother and sister and the little girl is deeply in love with her brother as she is convinced he is her true love reincarnated from a past life; main characters are fighting against each other all the time and there are also a lot of suggested sexual experiences every time some characters merge with each other when transforming into Aquarion.

The animation is excellent and the mecha designs are great, the Angels are also very well designed and the battles are fun to watch (though it is a little bit annoying that every time Aquarion has to take another form you have to watch the whole merging process again). The episodes are presented in anamorphic widescreen which looks great, dubbed in japanese and english with english subtitles.

I would only recommend this if you are a fan of mecha anime and have not seen NGEvangelion.",1211241600,2,2468,4.662068965517242
3080474,1,B00127R2XI,"My daughter and I planned to enjoy this anime series. Unfortunately, I fell asleep, and she was so confused and disgusted that she stopped watching. Why are people passing through walls? Why are there so many characters? Why do the characters go into some kind of sexual experience every time the do that Power Rangers unite to form a big robot thing?

I like anime, but I could not get into this show.  It just didn't grab me enough to hold my interest and want to continue watching the show.  Not that it was a few hours of my life I wish I could get back, it wasn't that bad, it just wasn't that good.

But if you like anime, I'd suggest at least giving it a shot.  There were others who seemed to like it... I just didn't happen to be one of them.",1210809600,,644,3.877862595419847
3080476,3,B00127R2XI,"Stop me if any of this seems new to you.  Earth is under attack by an enormously powerful alien enemy, seemingly stepped out of the pages of our ancient beliefs.  Fortuitously it turns out that Man has faced and beaten this enemy before, with the help of love motivated defectors and superior technology, and even more fortuitously it seems that the technology has recently been recovered and that reincarnations and/or descendants of the original heroes are available to do it again.  Thus, the fate of the Earth rests on the shoulders of a tiny handful of specially talented but also prideful, lustful, selfish, and angst-ridden teenagers of widely differing backgrounds who must learn, quite often the hard way, to put aside their differences under the guidance of a stern, weirdly behaving teacher, with the assistance of another whose blindness allows him/her to see things we can't, in order to master their highly advanced vehicles, in particular when they are transformed/merged together into a giant robot which must defeat these highly advanced enemies...

by punching, kicking, sword wielding, or arrow shooting.

Anybody try to stop me?  I didn't think so.  Aquarion is Derivative with a capital 'D'.

Now being derivative isn't automatically bad, but it does pose special challenges not faced by earlier creators, before the trail bravely blazed through the wilderness became a double-decker twelve-lane super-highway.  You've got to give your potential audience SOMETHING a bit different.  So far as I can tell from the first half of the first season, Aquarion does not, the minor differences I picked up on being calculated more to annoy than to attract.  Our chip-on-the-shoulder loner of a teenage main character (aren't they ALL chip-on-the-shoulder loners?) in this case turns out to be almost feral, given to scrambling on all fours, sniffing like a dog, catching and eating small animals raw, and biting people who sufficiently annoy him.  He and his ""destined true love"" find each other mutually repulsive (don't they ALWAYS find each other mutually repulsive?), but a large part of her reason in this case is because she is creepily fixated on her brother.  Finally there is a LOT of emphasis on how merging ""feels so good"", in obviously sexual ways.  The interviews with the director on the third disk reveal part of the problem: he spent well over a year getting the mecha right.  Would that he had spent as much time on the story and the characters.

In sum this is a split review.  If you are new to anime, if you find the idea of merging/transforming giant robots intriguing, give it 4 stars for the high quality and proven talent.  If the idea of one more combination of teenage angst and giant mecha makes you want to hurl, give it 2 stars.",1209859200,3,2770,4.946004319654428
3080477,3,B00127R2XI,"Created by Shoji Kawamori who was behind such classic anime series as Macross, Escaflowne, ""Aquarion"" has a interesting premise and is entertaining but borrows signficantly from other Anime shows including Kawamori's own previous creations.

When the Great Catastrophoe treatens to engulf the remains of Earth's population a race called the Shadow Angels awaken and pick off the remains of humanity. Our only defense are a group of humans who fly mecha (Vectors)called the Elementals. The discovery of Apollo a young man living in isolation who manages to use one of the Vectors when a pilot is injured to fight off the evil human hungry Shadow Angels gives hope to the Elementals. They believe he might be savior they've been foretold about a reincarnation of the Solar Wing who will help bring their struggle to an end and victory.

The series lacks the spark, depth and creativity of Kawamori other series and while the show is nice to look at with often visual stunning designs, the stories and characterizations are often lacking in depth and detail. The main characters are pretty shallow without much development which I found a bit disappointing as well. The first two discs were more a chore to sit through than a join while the third disc hinted at some potential by develing into what happened 12,000 years ago that forced the Shadow Angels into hibernation.

What saves ""Aquarion"" from the junk heap of derivative Anime is the beautifully rendered backgrounds and character designs. By the third disc of this series (it runs 26 episodes and half of those episodes are available on this the first set of the show)""Aquarion"" perks up and Animae fans may find just enough meat to keep them interested in gobbling up this series.

The show itself looks marvelous with bright, bold colors that postiviely pop. Audio is extremely active as well with a nice use of the surround speakers particularly during action scenes. Presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio it looks quite nice on widescreen TV sets without the black bars being too large if you want to watch it on a standard set that has a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. I should note that the first set I was sent wouldn't play in any of my players. The shows would start but the images would quickly dissolve into pixels going through fits and starts throughout the episode and randomly skipping around. Luckily, I was able to obtain a alternate first disc that didn't have constant pixelation and jam up my DVD player.

The extras are all located on the third disc of the set. We get a brief interview (about 5 minutes) with creator Kawamori, a 20 minute Q&A session from the Toyko Anime Fair where Kawamori and the voice talent discuss the series and four short featurettes that focus on the themes of the series. Finally FUNmation includes a cool looking pencil board within the case that your kids will enjoy almost as much as the series itself (when you aren't explaining it to them).

Overall, ""Aquarion"" was initially disappointing to me. While the premise was solid it wasn't as well developed as I had hoped relying on cliches of the genre and elements of other Kawamori created series to carry the first two discs. By the third disc, however, things perked up because we got to examine the past of the world we were thrown into in the very first episode. Personally, I'd like to see this developed further but I am unsure of how far this has been taken because I haven't seen the last 13 episodes of the first season.",1209168000,6,3475,4.7545605306799334
3080498,2,B00127R2XI,"""Aquarion"" is a strange, strange show to have to review.  Here is a new show from anime master Shoji Kawamori, who created the very popular series ""The Vision of Escaflowne.""  Escaflowne is a classic.  Not only is it considered by many to be one of the best animes ever created, I consider it to be one of the greatest SHOWS to ever air!  Since then though, old Kawamori has been struggling to find his high again.  ""Earth Girl Arjuna"" and ""Spring and Chaos"" were fine shows, but they still fell short of greatness.  Well, if ""Aquarion"" is any indication then Kawamori has a long, LONG way to go before capturing our attention again, as the only thing worth noting in this show is how unbelievably average it is.

""Aquarion"" revolves around Apollo, a homeless boy who acts like a dog and seems to have bad canine habits.  He is recruited by a government organization to pilot a three piece mecha of some sort, because he might be a reincarnated savor.  It takes three people to pilot the mecha, so Apollo is usually accompanied by two characters named Silvia and Sirius, a brother and sister who have a questionable relationship with each other.  And there are a couple of bad guys, who's motivations are murky for most of the show, and...you know, I'll just stop here; I can tell I've already lost you.  To say that the show is a mess would be kind.  As it stands the show is unforgivably boring.

For everything that happens, nothing seems to get accomplished.  The first ten episodes are dull and trite, as the characters seem to make no progress except in annoying the viewer more and more with each episode.  For the most part these characters are very unlikable, with their plights being understandable, but far from sympathetic.  Near the last four episodes on this set the show starts to hint that a change for the better is on the way, and the show does improve a tad bit at this point.  Overall though it comes in too late, and many viewers, I suspect, will have given up at the series before they reach this point.  The best thing about the show is the music, composed by fan favorite Yoko Kanno.

Now then, with that out of the way ""Aquarion"" is a significant release for the anime community.  Funimation has made it well known that they plan to slowly move away from single disk releases and start releasing season sets.  While we've seen these sets with ""Dragon Ball Z"" and other Funimation shows, this is the first actual release to receive a boxset without a prior release.  Judging from this release alone, I can safely say this is the right direction to take the anime business.  For $49.99 fans can get thirteen episodes of ""Aquarion,"" and in the next few months they can finish the series with the second box set.  It's cheap, it's collectible, and it gives fans a chance to sample a good portion of the show for a fair price.

This release also insures that shows get finished faster, which is something most people would agree is a good thing.  Heck, this show would have been KILLED if not for the boxset release!  The show is not good, but half the show is bought now.  I think everyone agrees they'd rather spend $50 for thirteen episodes before finding out it's a turkey over $30 for four episodes to find the same thing.  Plus the last few episodes are good enough, maybe getting the second season won't be a bad idea.  And remember folks: Shopping around can result in finding this set for even less (like around $35).",1208995200,2,3446,4.538087520259319
3080499,3,B00127R2XI,"Anime has a lot of cliches, and mecha anime has even more than its fair share. Especially if you include, you know, metaphysical stuff along with the giant killer robots.

And at first glance, ""Aquarion"" seems to have all those cliches and more, despite the stunningly lovely animation. Fortunately Shoji Kawamori's series starts hitting its stride after five or six episodes. At that point, the pomposity is replaced with a sly sense of humor that spoofs its own cliches, peppered with some decent characters and a bittersweet edge.

12,000 years ago, the Earth was invaded by the arrogant Shadow Angels, who abducted hundreds of people to drain their life force. But they were defeated by the Shadow Angel Apollonius (also called Solar Wing) and his human lover Celiane, in the enormous three-part mecha Aquarion. Now the Shadow Angels have returned. To defend the Earth, Aquarion is being piloted by a bunch of Element Users working for a special defense unit.

Then two element users -- including Celiane's reincarnation, spoiled princess Silvia -- come across a strange, feral street boy named Apollo. Not only is Apollo shockingly powerful, but he pilots the Aquarion as he always knew how -- yup, he's the reincarnation of Apollonius. Silvia is appalled by the idea that her long-lost soulmate is this rough, dirty boy, and Apollo is only coming along to rescue his abducted friend.

And as they battle the Shadow Angels, this motley little team of element users learns some weird lessons -- the benefits of fighting barefoot, dangers of dreams, corruption of jealousy, their ""first times,"" finding Apollo in a booby-trapped labyrinth, and overcoming their own fears even if they blow stuff up in the process. But then a familiar face returns -- Apollonius' ex-lover Touma, who still feels betrayed by Solar Wing jilting him for Celiane 12,000 years ago. And now he wants to reclaim Apollo -- or kill him.

The first several episodes of ""Aquarion"" are not very engaging -- they speed by too fast, don't really make you care about the characters, and basically consist of the same pattern: Apollo does something feral and/or stupid during training, Silvia and/or Sirius are disgusted, the Cherubim attack, but Our Heroes (including Apollo) save the day and learn a valuable lesson in the process.

All that, and the typical anime cliches too like the accidental kiss, the mystical soulmates who initially hate each other, and the big stompy robots. We even have some totally random elements, like the blind handicapped vampire girl.

But something happens about five or six episodes into ""Aquarion"" -- suddenly the series gains a sense of humor. It still has an overarcing storyline, and it's a rather cheesy one -- but Kawamori seems to become secure enough to let the story unfold gradually, and with a sly sense of spoofery instead of pompous seriousness. And some of the more bittersweet moments, such as Apollo reminiscing about his life with Baron, are quite nicely done.

But at that point, we've got intentionally silly attack names (""Unlucky Bottom Attack!""), comical deus ex machinae (Our Heroes are saved by a cry of ""DINNER!""), piroetting alien mecha, lots of pseudomystical stuff, Silvia knocking herself unconscious, and a Yoda-like commander who exists solely to teach the heroes Important Life Lessons and spout cryptic sayings. And I must admit, those orgasmic mecha merges are pretty funny.

The characters are something of a mixed bag, though. Kawamori spends too much time emphasizing that Apollo is a feral wild-card, so we don't get to see enough of his loyalty and kindness. He's far more endearing when he's being goofy (gobbling Silvia's ice cream before she can react), or working his butt off to save his friends. And Silvia is pretty much a brat to everyone, except the brother she has a bizarre incestuous crush on.

The supporting characters end up being much more interesting, partly because they seem so much more real. We've got the loyal, flirty athlete Pierre, the painfully unlucky Reika, and a handful of newbies who are still learning the ropes. And there's Silvia's brother Sirius, whose confidence and self-image are being slowly destroyed by Apollo's presence.

It's worth noting that the animation for ""Aquarion"" is utterly gorgeous. While it has a few things like swelling fists and little puffy cartoon faces, most of it is hyperrealistic, and infused with colour, light and exquisite shots of flowers, bejewelled books, and half-ruined buildings with a Grecian theme.

""Aquarion"" takes a long, long time to get off the ground. But once the satire kicks in, this mecha series becomes a gorgeous, fluffy brand of brain-candy.",1208649600,2,4674,5.06371911573472

3080501,4,B00127R2XI,"My 12 year old daughter is the anime buff so here is her review:

The animation was really good and the beginning and ending songs were great. The anime movie Aquarion is good for people who really like anime, action, and angel-like things.
But for the first episode it didn't really get into the characters much. In the beginning an orphan (I think he was an orphan) named Apollo and his friends were robbing a storage house for food and these robots came. Later two people came for Apollo. Well, I'm not going to get that much into it you'll have to watch it yourself but I thought it was really good. I only watch movies twice if I really, really like them and I think I will watch this one over a few times.",1208390400,,711,4.266666666666667
3080502,3,B00127R2XI,"I'll be upfront about it - I've never watched anime before ""Aquarion."" It's not that I have anything at all against it, I just never got into it.

Having watched this series, I'm a little confused. Who is this stuff targeted to?  Older audiences, certainly - as there are sexual themes that aren't suited for children (in my opinion, of course, I do realize there are parents that don't give a rat's act what their kids watch).  Now, I don't have a problem with mature content - but the voice acting in this series smacks of kiddie entertainment.  Again, I have no clue if this is consistant with anime in general.  But regardless, while watching ""Aquarion"" I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching something made for children - but too violent and sexual in nature for that age group to watch.  Let me put it this way, I probably would've loved this when I was 12.

Please know that I am not disparaging anime in general.  I realized all too clearly as I watched this that I was completely out of my element.  I didn't particularly like it, but I was impressed by the visuals and didn't mind watching one episode at a time.  Really it was just kind of weird and a little hard to follow.  I consulted my sister, who is a fairly big anime viewer, and sight-unseen she wrote this show off as a rip-off of other (supposedly better) anime shows.  Keep in mind, she hasn't watched this.  I just thought it was interesting to point out, because I don't follow the genre and wouldn't know if this was totally revolutionary or a tired rehash of other shows.

Oddly, at least with my DVDs, when you select the option of watching by episode (rather than 'play all'), the DVD still segues right into the next episode after one ends.  Sure, I can go back the menu - but I've seen this before occassionally and find it irritating.

Also, inside the box is a piece of see-through plastic with some artwork on it.  What the heck am I supposed to do with that??",1208390400,2,1953,4.42577030812325
3080503,3,B00127R2XI,"Fans of mecha-themed anime looking here for the next great series may be somewhat disappointed with what 'Aquarion' has to offer.  Coming from a great pedigree (created by Shoji Kawamori, who was involved with 'Escaflowne' and 'Macross' amongst others) the show initially seems to have plenty of promise but within the first 2 episodes fans of the genre will be slightly off-put by the derivative storyline and characters.  Which is really quite a shame because storyline aside 'Aquarion' is a very handsome series with terrific mech design and sprinkled throughout with some truly beautiful background art.

As for packaging goes, Funimation has done a great job in putting together a well-designed set with each of the 3 discs housed in their own wonderfully illustrated slimpack cases.  A transparent pencil board is also nicely included and packed within the slipcase.  As expected ample extras are also included (all on disc 3).  They include:

+Clean, opening and ending segments
+6 minute interview with Shoji Kawamori
+18 minute fan Q&A session with Kawamori and voice cast
+4 shorts examining the themes of the show

Video and Audio quality are also consistently excellent throughout.  The English voice track is also done very well and encoded in 5.1 Dolby.  Sadly, the superb Japanese track is only available in 2.0 Stereo.",1208390400,,1334,5.162790697674419
3080504,3,B00127R2XI,"Throughout all the reviews you will see over and over again the comparison to Neon Genesis Evangelion. This isn't just a passing similarity. There are a bunch of major plot points that come right out of NGE:

- World wide catastrophe that decimated the earth
- Aliens called Angels invading and trying to take over the world
- A Mysterious government agency that is defending the earth from the Angels
- Humans using alien technology that they found but don't quite understand to fight back
- Young pilots with personal problems using the alien technology/giant robots
- A Mysterious project leader that seems to have ulterior motives that no one can figure out.

These similarities alone do not make Aquarion good or bad but they do raise the bar. For me they were distracting and I had to get past them to take in Aquarion as it's own anime. I wasn't as gripped or intrigued as I was when I watched NGE. A lot of anime (especially Japanese ones) can take quite a few episodes to hit their stride. There can my mysteries and plot lines that take many episodes to resolve so maybe this will happen here.

Overall, this anime seems to be targeted more towards the action packed anime audience. It feigns depth but it's really not all that deep. It's fun to watch, but doesn't seem destined to become a classic.",1208390400,,1309,4.585470085470085

The storyline and the character development is what makes this a very engaging and interesting anime. The teammates have complex backgrounds and relationships and it is interesting seeing them develop their abilities. Some of the elements remember their past lives and so that adds a dimension of interest, particularly when there's a potential for reuniting past romantic partners.

3080507,3,B00127R2XI,"I've been a fan of Anime for a number of years now but generally prefer more detailed and/or feature-length productions. And watching Aquarion reminded me of exactly why that is. The plot, as many of the reviewers have mentioned, is a fairly recycled one, with elements from other series like Voltron and Neon Genesis Evangelion. I have nothing against recycled concepts though...not if they are well-done and bring something new and interesting. But that just was not the case here. What I found most unsettling about this series was the rather strong religious overtones (from an enemy called the ""Angels"" to the mecha robots requiring three (a trinity) of pilots to combine, the main character being a reincarnation of some ""messiah"" character, etc.) juxtaposed against some fairly unheroic and unpleasant characters. Perhaps there is more character growth in the future episodes. But taking just this Part 1 on its own merits, this group just seems to be constantly fighting and bickering and it's hard to enjoy a show when you don't really feel like you have some ""good guys"" to root for. The ""possession"" of the central character Apollo I found eerily creepy in a lot of ways, there just didn't seem to be enough back story and explanation of it for it to truly stand up on its own and make much sense. And that seemed to be the case for a lot of what is going on in these episodes. I do think the serial nature of this is where things tend to fall apart. Not that you can't have good anime series, you certainly can. But it seems like it keeps trying to squeeze in all these character lines while still fitting in a big fight sequence in each episode and the character back-story and development suffers as a result, leaving the watcher often confused and somewhat unfulfilled.

Having said all that, the animation here is top-notch and quite a treat to watch just for the technical nature of it. The soundtrack/music is also very well done. I appreciate the well-done packaging of the box set (takes up minimal space compared to some other hefty box sets) and really dedicated anime fans will probably appreciate owning this regardless of the flaws. If you are new to anime though, I'd suggest passing on this, and looking at other, better shows.",1208304000,2,2254,4.75
3314832,3,B00127R2XI,"This is going to be one confused review.

There are things I really liked about this series, and things I really hated. Overall, not a completely horrible way to spend your time, but I'll have to leave a lot of the comparative stuff to folks more in the know than me. (Specifically the shows this show is said to steal from.)

Likes:

Vivid, saturated colors
Fairly well integrated use of 3D and 2D animation
Complex scripting

Dislikes:

Dumb stereotypes GALORE
Bait and switch plot points

A whole lot happens in these 13 episodes. And I admit, sometimes it made very little sense. I know too the plot is similar to another, better known, series.

The ham-fisted English actors (who sound like 1990's Saturday Morning action cartoon) and the at times wrong-headed English dialogue make this a ""Japanese Language Only"" title.

The homoerotic elements are WAY over the top in the English. The voice work of the ""bad"" guys in the Japanese language track didn't suffer from broad, almost slapstick stereotypes.

Like all series, the final episode had lots of reveal, and I have to say I didn't really appreciate or care too much about the resolution of the story arc. I'll give you an idea of what you have to look forward to:

A animalistic male lead who speaks perfect Japanese/English, but has the social skills of a baboon (even running around on all fours and sniffing out everything from hurt feelings to laser beams). Oddly, none of the other folks in his initial group of friends show any of these odd traits, pointing to weak writing.

A female lead who is shrill, childish, and more than a little incestuous.

Her oh-so-pretty (and even in the Japanese over-the-top) brother. Who is as pompous as he is talented.

Assorted stereotypes -- the ""wise"" commander who in this guise seems to do little but spout plot points and drivel; the asexual female commander; the pompous blowhard of a administrative leader; the self-described 'bad luck charm' of the elementals who seems to feel better about herself only when it serves the plotline, only to have her slip back into her funk as soon as things settle down; and two pre-teens who seem mostly to be there for comic relief.

I could bore you with the overall plot, something about a battle that took place 12,000 years ago between Shadow Angels and who knows what. You've got angels, vampires, and Gods. All battling out for the few remaining humans (who are either living their lives as normal, or living in refugee camps, or trapped inside these strange flying soul suckers (that grab bodies too) depending on the mood of the writers at that given instance. The city nearby is either destroyed, or full of folks.

The lack of continuity is one of the more debilitating aspects of the show. The other is the leering sexuality. Virtually all the characters appear naked during the 'Aquarion' transformation sequences -- because obviously forming a giant fighting robot is the exact same thing as having sex. But it is worse than that, at times the show pays way too much attention to the pre-teen girl's underwear and what's barely contained by them.

The rather obvious crush of this girl on her sempei is downplayed, where the situation between one of the Angels and one of the male elementals is anything but. But this too is played for the squirm factor.

The extras are alright, mostly consisting of obvious promotional items that would have aired on Japanese TV. I learned more about the plot in thirty seconds of one of the talks than I got from watching the actual show.

But all this is mote if you really need your anime buzz, and this is the only think in your DVD player.

If you find something else, or could at least explain what the heck is going on (and why I should care) let me know.",1208131200,,3757,4.691019786910198
3314833,4,B00127R2XI,"Typically I prefer the american science fiction animation compared to the japanese ones.

This was is an exception - I really enjoyed watching this anime series - the story line is that there is a Aquaron (a super 'Transformer') which has woken up after 12000 years of slumber and we have all kinds of elements trying to control it.

Animation quality is superb - a mix of classical animation with digital animation.  The only aspect of the anime which I do not like is the dialogues - which at sometimes seems very distorted/broken - I am not sure if it is because of the translation or  if it was originally intended to be like that.",1208044800,,635,4.495652173913044
3314834,5,B00127R2XI,"This is a great series with a very compelling storyline. The ""Legendary Mechanical Angel Aquarion"" is very reminiscent of Voltron, but the space/futuristic setting gives it a fresh twist.  This is an excellent example of well-done science fiction anime.  With reincarnation, advanced technology and aliens all coming together in the mix.  A lot of time is spent developing relationships between characters and the action scenes are pretty amazing. The background for the story is revealed a little slowly and the first few episodes are a bit confusing, but it is cleared up before you make it to disc 2.  The animation itself is top notch and quite beautiful.  The characters are appealing to look at and the voice cast does a good job.

However, I would not recommend this show for children.  There are some sexual overtones, particularly when the characters are ""merging"" during battle. The only thing that bothered me about the show is the implied incestuous relationship between Silvia and Sirius (sister and brother). However, this didn't ruin my overall enjoyment of the show.  This series is very similar to Evangalion, but I'm hoping the ending will not turn out to be as philosophical.

However, in this case, the abilities of the pilots also provide additional powers to Aquarion Mars, Luna, and Sol.

It's a fun series, and there are a few good belly-laugh moments right around the middle of the series, before the tone shifts into a more serious tone. The music is quite good, and the quality is high throughout. There are also a few bonus features, such as tv-length featurettes concerning the production of the show, and one commentary track by the American voice actors.

3314926,5,B00127R2XI,"Long ago, I was a Jazz snob who realized that popular music was also full of great music, and eventually, after listening to a lot of bad music and some good, I found artists that I really love--so now I'm a popular music, R&B fan and have almost completely stopped listening to Jazz.

I am also a big film fan, and somewhat of an anime fan but only of the greats like Miyazaki. And since I lived in Japan for many years I thought I should check out some of the less aclaimed anime as well.

If you have a mild interest in Japanese popular anime, this is a good place to start.  It's also a good series for people who are trying to learn the language and want to get the sound of it in your ears.

For language learners I recommend watching it with subtitles or with English voiceover the first time, then watching it again and again in Japanese with or without subtitles.  This method really helped me gain fluency years ago, before I lived in Japan, and the spoken Japanese on this video is clear and plain enough that you should be able to pick up a lot of common phrasing from it.  I found that when I already understood what was being said, listening to the Japanese and picking up some of the language was a lot easier (Same goes for watching the news or a live action film).

The problem for me with Aquarion is that it's for younger audiences. What I'm looking for in anime is mature, sophisticated, intellectual philosophical themes with cool graphics and being willing to be sexually explicit (but non-gratuitous) if it's appropriate.
I'm sick of the entertainment industry knuckling under to the establishment censors who want to keep compelling art from the market. What we need is a production company and distributors who are willing to put out really cutting edge, sharp stories and content and be willing to ignore the heat from the religious and conservative wackos when it blows up.
Blood+ Plus is an example of anime that I love, but even that doesn't satisfy my craving for the explicitly erotic. I'm still waiting for what I really want, and I'm sick of society repressing really cool stuff.",1230681600,,1082,4.950549450549451
3314929,5,B00127R2XI,"to a very interesting Anime series.  Aquarion is based on an ancient legend of a great hero/robot called Aquarion.  The story starts with various candidates that are vying to fly the famed hero and only a certain number will make it in.  Also depending on which 3 heroes for Aquarion a different formation or type of the robot will form.  Its also interesting because the people's emotions tie into it heavily as far as the overall power and function of the robot.

One candidate named Apollo is one that starts out as a rough and tough kid in an area that has decimated by an ancient and very powerful foe.  He, his friend and a few other people are staying alive just barely.  When the foe makes another attack on the already devastated city, i won't tell a whole lot more.  It will ruin things for those interested.

The story itself is pretty involved between the various characters.  It also has its moments of comedy and fun mixed in between.  Overall, Aquarion is an intersting anime series mixed with robots, powerful humans and enemies and a solid story that should keep all who chose to watch interested and leaves things open for the 2nd part of Season 1.",1223942400,2,1166,4.5576923076923075

Extras on the third disc were, sorry to admit, no big deal.

Overall, the same old same old: Teenaged mechs and ancient monsters that are back to rule the world, so the good kids suit up and... Wait, Didn't Bill Murray do that in GHOSTBUSTERS?",1219363200,,397,4.28
3314931,3,B00127R2XI,"Aquarion or Genesis of Aquarion is the product of Shji Kawamori, the man who created Vision of Escaflowne as well as much of the Macross series.  Aquarion is yet another giant Mecha series that ran for 26 episodes on TV Tokyo in 2005.  This boxed set presents the first half of the season, 13 episodes on three DVDs.  Aquarion combines traditional 2D aniamtion with 3D animation taking over during the mecha battles.  The look is seamlessly rendered and simply dazzling.  The battles between the giant war machines are the highlight of each episode.

Aquarion has drawn unflattering comparisons to Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Certainly the themes and plots are similar, perhaps a bit too similar:  Global Cataclysms, using teenagers piloting Mecha to battle beings known as Angels... Kawamori certainly won't win many points for originality but this sort of copying of plots goes on all the time in Anime and Aquarion can stand on its own.

The ""Great Catastrophe"" has killed two-thirds of the world's population and awakened the Shadow Angels from a 12,000 year hibernation.  The Shadow Angels subsist on the life force of human beings called prana.  The Shadow Angels harvest the prana by capturing humans with giant machines guarded by mecha known as Cherubim.  To combat the Shadow Angels, the organization called Deava recruits special teenagers known as Elements or Element users.  They are trained to pilot three advanced warcraft known as Vectors.  The three Vectors can then merge together to form Aquarion.  Aquarion has several different forms it can take on with each Vector becoming the lead depending upon what form they merge into.

The Elements are a diverse lot.  There is the snobbish and elitist Sirius and his younger sister Silvia; there is soccer star Pierre; friendly but bad luck-prone Reika; and Apollo, the orphaned, feral-like young man whose incredible abilities astound his fellow trainees.  Apollo may, or may not be, the reincarnation of the great hero Apollonius, also known as Solar Wing, who helped defeat the Shadow Angels thousands of years ago but is still loved by Toma, the leader of the Shadow Angels.

Each episode has the same basic outline.  The first half has the students generally training with Deava commander General Fudou or the other commanders.  This is the time we get to explore the personalities of the main characters.  Silvia is the reincarnation of Celiane, Apollonius' lover many millennia ago and this leads to all out verbal and physical battles between she and Apollo.  She cannot believe that he is truly her reincarnated lover.  This constant bickering does become tiresome after a few episodes and thankfully other characters are explored in depth as well.

The second half of each episode has three of the team responding to a threat from the Cherubim soldiers and merging to become Aquarion.  While merging, the three members all experience what can only be described as a sexual orgasm of pleasure.  This is a bit weird and one would think HIGHLY distracting in the midst of a battle.

Aquarion's visuals are stunning!  The mech battles are earth-shattering and the 3D animation brings it all right into the viewer's lap.  In almost each episode Aquarion has to find a new way to defeat the Cherubim as the enemy mechs are constantly adapting to Aquarion's attacks.

Aquarion is enjoyable although the familiar pattern of each episode can get boring after a while and you can't wait until the next mecha fight begins.

AQUARION starts out with this theme, brings in the fan-favorite idea of coming robot sections into a bigger, giant robot with different forms/functions, and layers in lots of action.

Considerable thought has gone into the apocalyptic world as well.  The Great Catastrophe brought about the end of the world, and brought back the Shadow Angels, a kind of vampiric winged race that sucks the life force out of the victims.  It's creepy stuff with a great backstory and good visuals.",1219276800,,624,4.849056603773585

The action sequences get a little repetitive for me, but they are still pretty good quality and generally enjoyable. THe art is very pretty. One of the reasons I like it is that it does not seem to be written with only 14 year old boys in mind.

The whole DVD series is of a very high quality and include a good English and Japanese language track and subtitles.  The picture quality and sound quality are very good.  The packaging is also nice.  I hate spending money on things that seem like they will fall apart.

3314967,4,B00127R2XI,"Awakened after 12,000 years, creatures known as Shadow Angels are harvesting humans for their life energy on a post-apocalyptic Earth of the near future. An organization called Deava is humanity's only chance for survival as it recruits and trains young pilots to fly its Vector planes, which, in the right hands, can be combined to form the super robot Aquarion. But special individuals are needed for such a job, and one who seems sent right out of ancient prophecy is a half-wild street boy named Apollo, much to the chagrin of the other recruits. His most contrary new friend is the beautiful Princess Silvia, who is sure her older brother Sirius is the true hero of legend they have all been waiting for. Through the course of the first 13 episodes which make up this 3 disc DVD set, we follow the recruiting of young Apollo, discover the secrets of his past, and watch as the characters' personalities and relationships are revealed and develop. There are also some cool CGI mecha fights that are well blended with the traditionally animated characters.

Now, you're probably thinking that the last thing the world needs is another Anime about giant robots piloted by sassy teens. Well, you could view Aquarion as just another of those, a total copycat of things that came before, or you could view it as the culmination of the dream. Sort of an ultimate Anime giant robot show. Though I'm not as well-versed in previous big robot shows as I should be, I'd wager this one has some of the best visuals ever. And, while it doesn't have the gorgeous Asuka Langley, it certainly has its share of Anime hotties (which is the main reason I dabble, very lightly, in Anime). This one also has some unique qualities that probably make it not so appropriate for the youngest viewers. For example, Silvia is pretty much in love with her brother, and I'm not exaggerating at all. They've been led to believe they are reincarnated lovers, and she is all for the idea. Besides that, when the young pilots combine their ships to form the Aquarion robot, they do something called ""merging"" which is meant to be some sort of spiritual connection but produces a pleasure that is unquestionably implied to be orgasmic. In fact, there's one whole episode that plays specifically on the comparison.

Overall, the show grows on you with each episode as you become more and more involved in the characters and the story, and as it feels less about the robot fights and more about the people. Though, one can only imagine where it is going without having seen it already. This set is a good start. Whether or not the show continues to be good I have yet to find out. I'm interested in seeing more though. This set comes with some nice extras. You get inserts, including a really cool plastic card, and on disc 3 there is an interview with the director, a Q&A with the director and voice actors from the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2005, 4 informative clips about the machines of the film, textless versions of the opening and closing songs, and a bunch of Anime trailers. Written and directed by the renowned Shoji Kawamori and presented with dubbed or original language audio and English subtitle option, I do recommend this to anyone looking for a giant robot anime with an interesting story and satisfying visuals.",1213833600,,3302,4.730902777777778
3314968,3,B00127R2XI,"I cannot say that I really liked this series, the premise was interesting, although the production often seems to get confused, inevitably leading to the viewer's confusion (might have benefited from reading Vogler's The Writers Journey). Each episode seems very formula in nature, at least for the first two disks, in that the team must master a new skill or aspect of their teamwork to defeat the latest beast of the Shadow Angels, and while they always reach the point of mastery and defeat the beast, they always seem to fail to save any of the innocents.

Much of the series confusion lies in the plethora of main characters, at last count I had it somewhere over twelve, and while half can be relegated to supporting characters, that still leaves about a half dozen to vie for the viewer's attention. Add to that the confused sexuality of early to late teens with pseudo-incestuous sibling devotion, homosexual undertones, heterosexual overtones and weak innuendo, and you have a fairly baffling stew (by the way, the nudity cited in the TV-MA rating is all Barbie doll nudity, nothing most 5 year olds have already seen). Throw in the typical mysticism of anime, techno or not, and the viewer can easily go into overload.

On the positive side the visuals, if you can get past the characters, are very appealing, as is the sound track. If anything keeps you watching it is the animation; at widescreen on my 52"" screen with the 5.1 surround sound, I was enjoying the ride, even while my subconscious was puking over the items noted previously.

Bottom line, there are better series out there, if given the choice I would have reset the clock and passed on this experience in favor of others. This is a middle of the road anime series in my opinion. P-)",1212796800,,1759,4.723127035830619
3314969,4,B00127R2XI,"But being exceedingly Japanese is not a bad thing necessarily.  :)  I do have to question, however, whether a western audience would appreciate it, though.

Japan loves giant robots.  That is no secret.  They also love teamwork, romance, woven plots that extend across hundreds of shows...

Here, we see something of a synthesis between Evangelion and Escaflowne, but beyond that, we see culture stretching all the way back to Japan's first giant robot animes.

It is a little difficult to explain succinctly, the amount of ""Japanese-ness"" (or at least pop-robot-anime-Japanese-ness) present here.  Just because you like Evangelion does not mean you'll like this!  Even if you liked Escaflowne, you might not.

One thing I can promise you, however, is that if you're interested in Japanese culture, and interested in seeing what they see, and are a scholar like myself, you will enjoy it, at least, from that perspective.

All the social motifs of friendship and teamwork--everything from this to, say, kendo, which is where it first became practice to shout the title of your ""attack"" as you executed it.

This is a peculiar form of entertainment from our perspective.  If you're willing to accept that, and experience it, I welcome you to.  It is also somewhat of a commitment, a rather long series.

So caveat, emptor.  Read all the reviews (not just mine!) and think before you hop in.

As far as the animation, it's excellent; the character designs are fun, the dialogue (in Japanese at least!) well written and recorded (there were a few lines I found especially captivating and poetic, which I paraphrase--""Time and distance are products born from an uncertain heart"").

After the first few episodes, actually before the first episode even concluded, I was almost certain it would receive a five-star score.  Its particular culture, however, and all that comes with it, as well as the somewhat plodding nature of the story, reduce the rating for me.  Others might be even more critical.  I have not perused other criticism written on the show.",1211328000,2,2050,5.023738872403561
3314970,2,B00127R2XI,"I started watching this show a couple weeks ago, excited with the idea that this was coming from the creators of Macross; from the very beginning I thought this was nothing but a copy of Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE). As a fan of the Evangelion series, it was obvious to me that many of the ideas presented in Aquarion were copied directly from NGEvangelion. I then decided I'd give Aquarion a chance and watch it over as this could have been only a first impression thing.

Wrong.

The story pretends to be original but truth is, a lot of the ideas presented in it are carbon copied from Evangelion, just to list a few examples I can think of right now:

1. Both stories are consequence of a ""Great Catastrophe"" (called ""Second Impact"" in NGE)
2. The title itself, ""Genesis of Aquarion"" (vs. ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"")
3. Aquarion has to fight against the ""Dark Angels"" (called simply ""Angels"" in NGE)
4. In both series an element/pilot has to synchronize with the mechas.
5. Both have a mysterious character in charge of the operations of a secret organization, in Aquarion, Commander Gen Fudou will even strike the same poses as Gendo Ikari in NGE.
6. Aquarion uses a lot of the symbology also used in NGE (for instance the ""Tree of Sephirot"" also known as the ""Tree of life"")

With all these facts if you watched NGE you pretty much know what to expect from ""Aquarion"". The story isn't really that compelling and I am not interested at all in seeing how this ends. Characters need serious development; it is hard to believe that these brats are humanity's last hope of survival. There are 2 characters (Silvia and Sirius) who are brother and sister and the little girl is deeply in love with her brother as she is convinced he is her true love reincarnated from a past life; main characters are fighting against each other all the time and there are also a lot of suggested sexual experiences every time some characters merge with each other when transforming into Aquarion.

The animation is excellent and the mecha designs are great, the Angels are also very well designed and the battles are fun to watch (though it is a little bit annoying that every time Aquarion has to take another form you have to watch the whole merging process again). The episodes are presented in anamorphic widescreen which looks great, dubbed in japanese and english with english subtitles.

I would only recommend this if you are a fan of mecha anime and have not seen NGEvangelion.",1211241600,2,2468,4.662068965517242

3314973,3,B00127R2XI,"Stop me if any of this seems new to you.  Earth is under attack by an enormously powerful alien enemy, seemingly stepped out of the pages of our ancient beliefs.  Fortuitously it turns out that Man has faced and beaten this enemy before, with the help of love motivated defectors and superior technology, and even more fortuitously it seems that the technology has recently been recovered and that reincarnations and/or descendants of the original heroes are available to do it again.  Thus, the fate of the Earth rests on the shoulders of a tiny handful of specially talented but also prideful, lustful, selfish, and angst-ridden teenagers of widely differing backgrounds who must learn, quite often the hard way, to put aside their differences under the guidance of a stern, weirdly behaving teacher, with the assistance of another whose blindness allows him/her to see things we can't, in order to master their highly advanced vehicles, in particular when they are transformed/merged together into a giant robot which must defeat these highly advanced enemies...

by punching, kicking, sword wielding, or arrow shooting.

Anybody try to stop me?  I didn't think so.  Aquarion is Derivative with a capital 'D'.

Now being derivative isn't automatically bad, but it does pose special challenges not faced by earlier creators, before the trail bravely blazed through the wilderness became a double-decker twelve-lane super-highway.  You've got to give your potential audience SOMETHING a bit different.  So far as I can tell from the first half of the first season, Aquarion does not, the minor differences I picked up on being calculated more to annoy than to attract.  Our chip-on-the-shoulder loner of a teenage main character (aren't they ALL chip-on-the-shoulder loners?) in this case turns out to be almost feral, given to scrambling on all fours, sniffing like a dog, catching and eating small animals raw, and biting people who sufficiently annoy him.  He and his ""destined true love"" find each other mutually repulsive (don't they ALWAYS find each other mutually repulsive?), but a large part of her reason in this case is because she is creepily fixated on her brother.  Finally there is a LOT of emphasis on how merging ""feels so good"", in obviously sexual ways.  The interviews with the director on the third disk reveal part of the problem: he spent well over a year getting the mecha right.  Would that he had spent as much time on the story and the characters.

In sum this is a split review.  If you are new to anime, if you find the idea of merging/transforming giant robots intriguing, give it 4 stars for the high quality and proven talent.  If the idea of one more combination of teenage angst and giant mecha makes you want to hurl, give it 2 stars.",1209859200,3,2770,4.946004319654428
3314974,3,B00127R2XI,"Created by Shoji Kawamori who was behind such classic anime series as Macross, Escaflowne, ""Aquarion"" has a interesting premise and is entertaining but borrows signficantly from other Anime shows including Kawamori's own previous creations.

When the Great Catastrophoe treatens to engulf the remains of Earth's population a race called the Shadow Angels awaken and pick off the remains of humanity. Our only defense are a group of humans who fly mecha (Vectors)called the Elementals. The discovery of Apollo a young man living in isolation who manages to use one of the Vectors when a pilot is injured to fight off the evil human hungry Shadow Angels gives hope to the Elementals. They believe he might be savior they've been foretold about a reincarnation of the Solar Wing who will help bring their struggle to an end and victory.

The series lacks the spark, depth and creativity of Kawamori other series and while the show is nice to look at with often visual stunning designs, the stories and characterizations are often lacking in depth and detail. The main characters are pretty shallow without much development which I found a bit disappointing as well. The first two discs were more a chore to sit through than a join while the third disc hinted at some potential by develing into what happened 12,000 years ago that forced the Shadow Angels into hibernation.

What saves ""Aquarion"" from the junk heap of derivative Anime is the beautifully rendered backgrounds and character designs. By the third disc of this series (it runs 26 episodes and half of those episodes are available on this the first set of the show)""Aquarion"" perks up and Animae fans may find just enough meat to keep them interested in gobbling up this series.

The show itself looks marvelous with bright, bold colors that postiviely pop. Audio is extremely active as well with a nice use of the surround speakers particularly during action scenes. Presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio it looks quite nice on widescreen TV sets without the black bars being too large if you want to watch it on a standard set that has a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. I should note that the first set I was sent wouldn't play in any of my players. The shows would start but the images would quickly dissolve into pixels going through fits and starts throughout the episode and randomly skipping around. Luckily, I was able to obtain a alternate first disc that didn't have constant pixelation and jam up my DVD player.

The extras are all located on the third disc of the set. We get a brief interview (about 5 minutes) with creator Kawamori, a 20 minute Q&A session from the Toyko Anime Fair where Kawamori and the voice talent discuss the series and four short featurettes that focus on the themes of the series. Finally FUNmation includes a cool looking pencil board within the case that your kids will enjoy almost as much as the series itself (when you aren't explaining it to them).

Overall, ""Aquarion"" was initially disappointing to me. While the premise was solid it wasn't as well developed as I had hoped relying on cliches of the genre and elements of other Kawamori created series to carry the first two discs. By the third disc, however, things perked up because we got to examine the past of the world we were thrown into in the very first episode. Personally, I'd like to see this developed further but I am unsure of how far this has been taken because I haven't seen the last 13 episodes of the first season.",1209168000,6,3475,4.7545605306799334
3314995,2,B00127R2XI,"""Aquarion"" is a strange, strange show to have to review.  Here is a new show from anime master Shoji Kawamori, who created the very popular series ""The Vision of Escaflowne.""  Escaflowne is a classic.  Not only is it considered by many to be one of the best animes ever created, I consider it to be one of the greatest SHOWS to ever air!  Since then though, old Kawamori has been struggling to find his high again.  ""Earth Girl Arjuna"" and ""Spring and Chaos"" were fine shows, but they still fell short of greatness.  Well, if ""Aquarion"" is any indication then Kawamori has a long, LONG way to go before capturing our attention again, as the only thing worth noting in this show is how unbelievably average it is.

""Aquarion"" revolves around Apollo, a homeless boy who acts like a dog and seems to have bad canine habits.  He is recruited by a government organization to pilot a three piece mecha of some sort, because he might be a reincarnated savor.  It takes three people to pilot the mecha, so Apollo is usually accompanied by two characters named Silvia and Sirius, a brother and sister who have a questionable relationship with each other.  And there are a couple of bad guys, who's motivations are murky for most of the show, and...you know, I'll just stop here; I can tell I've already lost you.  To say that the show is a mess would be kind.  As it stands the show is unforgivably boring.

For everything that happens, nothing seems to get accomplished.  The first ten episodes are dull and trite, as the characters seem to make no progress except in annoying the viewer more and more with each episode.  For the most part these characters are very unlikable, with their plights being understandable, but far from sympathetic.  Near the last four episodes on this set the show starts to hint that a change for the better is on the way, and the show does improve a tad bit at this point.  Overall though it comes in too late, and many viewers, I suspect, will have given up at the series before they reach this point.  The best thing about the show is the music, composed by fan favorite Yoko Kanno.

Now then, with that out of the way ""Aquarion"" is a significant release for the anime community.  Funimation has made it well known that they plan to slowly move away from single disk releases and start releasing season sets.  While we've seen these sets with ""Dragon Ball Z"" and other Funimation shows, this is the first actual release to receive a boxset without a prior release.  Judging from this release alone, I can safely say this is the right direction to take the anime business.  For $49.99 fans can get thirteen episodes of ""Aquarion,"" and in the next few months they can finish the series with the second box set.  It's cheap, it's collectible, and it gives fans a chance to sample a good portion of the show for a fair price.

This release also insures that shows get finished faster, which is something most people would agree is a good thing.  Heck, this show would have been KILLED if not for the boxset release!  The show is not good, but half the show is bought now.  I think everyone agrees they'd rather spend $50 for thirteen episodes before finding out it's a turkey over $30 for four episodes to find the same thing.  Plus the last few episodes are good enough, maybe getting the second season won't be a bad idea.  And remember folks: Shopping around can result in finding this set for even less (like around $35).",1208995200,2,3446,4.538087520259319
3314996,3,B00127R2XI,"Anime has a lot of cliches, and mecha anime has even more than its fair share. Especially if you include, you know, metaphysical stuff along with the giant killer robots.

And at first glance, ""Aquarion"" seems to have all those cliches and more, despite the stunningly lovely animation. Fortunately Shoji Kawamori's series starts hitting its stride after five or six episodes. At that point, the pomposity is replaced with a sly sense of humor that spoofs its own cliches, peppered with some decent characters and a bittersweet edge.

12,000 years ago, the Earth was invaded by the arrogant Shadow Angels, who abducted hundreds of people to drain their life force. But they were defeated by the Shadow Angel Apollonius (also called Solar Wing) and his human lover Celiane, in the enormous three-part mecha Aquarion. Now the Shadow Angels have returned. To defend the Earth, Aquarion is being piloted by a bunch of Element Users working for a special defense unit.

Then two element users -- including Celiane's reincarnation, spoiled princess Silvia -- come across a strange, feral street boy named Apollo. Not only is Apollo shockingly powerful, but he pilots the Aquarion as he always knew how -- yup, he's the reincarnation of Apollonius. Silvia is appalled by the idea that her long-lost soulmate is this rough, dirty boy, and Apollo is only coming along to rescue his abducted friend.

And as they battle the Shadow Angels, this motley little team of element users learns some weird lessons -- the benefits of fighting barefoot, dangers of dreams, corruption of jealousy, their ""first times,"" finding Apollo in a booby-trapped labyrinth, and overcoming their own fears even if they blow stuff up in the process. But then a familiar face returns -- Apollonius' ex-lover Touma, who still feels betrayed by Solar Wing jilting him for Celiane 12,000 years ago. And now he wants to reclaim Apollo -- or kill him.

The first several episodes of ""Aquarion"" are not very engaging -- they speed by too fast, don't really make you care about the characters, and basically consist of the same pattern: Apollo does something feral and/or stupid during training, Silvia and/or Sirius are disgusted, the Cherubim attack, but Our Heroes (including Apollo) save the day and learn a valuable lesson in the process.

All that, and the typical anime cliches too like the accidental kiss, the mystical soulmates who initially hate each other, and the big stompy robots. We even have some totally random elements, like the blind handicapped vampire girl.

But something happens about five or six episodes into ""Aquarion"" -- suddenly the series gains a sense of humor. It still has an overarcing storyline, and it's a rather cheesy one -- but Kawamori seems to become secure enough to let the story unfold gradually, and with a sly sense of spoofery instead of pompous seriousness. And some of the more bittersweet moments, such as Apollo reminiscing about his life with Baron, are quite nicely done.

But at that point, we've got intentionally silly attack names (""Unlucky Bottom Attack!""), comical deus ex machinae (Our Heroes are saved by a cry of ""DINNER!""), piroetting alien mecha, lots of pseudomystical stuff, Silvia knocking herself unconscious, and a Yoda-like commander who exists solely to teach the heroes Important Life Lessons and spout cryptic sayings. And I must admit, those orgasmic mecha merges are pretty funny.

The characters are something of a mixed bag, though. Kawamori spends too much time emphasizing that Apollo is a feral wild-card, so we don't get to see enough of his loyalty and kindness. He's far more endearing when he's being goofy (gobbling Silvia's ice cream before she can react), or working his butt off to save his friends. And Silvia is pretty much a brat to everyone, except the brother she has a bizarre incestuous crush on.

The supporting characters end up being much more interesting, partly because they seem so much more real. We've got the loyal, flirty athlete Pierre, the painfully unlucky Reika, and a handful of newbies who are still learning the ropes. And there's Silvia's brother Sirius, whose confidence and self-image are being slowly destroyed by Apollo's presence.

It's worth noting that the animation for ""Aquarion"" is utterly gorgeous. While it has a few things like swelling fists and little puffy cartoon faces, most of it is hyperrealistic, and infused with colour, light and exquisite shots of flowers, bejewelled books, and half-ruined buildings with a Grecian theme.

""Aquarion"" takes a long, long time to get off the ground. But once the satire kicks in, this mecha series becomes a gorgeous, fluffy brand of brain-candy.",1208649600,2,4674,5.06371911573472

3314998,4,B00127R2XI,"My 12 year old daughter is the anime buff so here is her review:

The animation was really good and the beginning and ending songs were great. The anime movie Aquarion is good for people who really like anime, action, and angel-like things.
But for the first episode it didn't really get into the characters much. In the beginning an orphan (I think he was an orphan) named Apollo and his friends were robbing a storage house for food and these robots came. Later two people came for Apollo. Well, I'm not going to get that much into it you'll have to watch it yourself but I thought it was really good. I only watch movies twice if I really, really like them and I think I will watch this one over a few times.",1208390400,,711,4.266666666666667
3314999,3,B00127R2XI,"I'll be upfront about it - I've never watched anime before ""Aquarion."" It's not that I have anything at all against it, I just never got into it.

Having watched this series, I'm a little confused. Who is this stuff targeted to?  Older audiences, certainly - as there are sexual themes that aren't suited for children (in my opinion, of course, I do realize there are parents that don't give a rat's act what their kids watch).  Now, I don't have a problem with mature content - but the voice acting in this series smacks of kiddie entertainment.  Again, I have no clue if this is consistant with anime in general.  But regardless, while watching ""Aquarion"" I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching something made for children - but too violent and sexual in nature for that age group to watch.  Let me put it this way, I probably would've loved this when I was 12.

Please know that I am not disparaging anime in general.  I realized all too clearly as I watched this that I was completely out of my element.  I didn't particularly like it, but I was impressed by the visuals and didn't mind watching one episode at a time.  Really it was just kind of weird and a little hard to follow.  I consulted my sister, who is a fairly big anime viewer, and sight-unseen she wrote this show off as a rip-off of other (supposedly better) anime shows.  Keep in mind, she hasn't watched this.  I just thought it was interesting to point out, because I don't follow the genre and wouldn't know if this was totally revolutionary or a tired rehash of other shows.

Oddly, at least with my DVDs, when you select the option of watching by episode (rather than 'play all'), the DVD still segues right into the next episode after one ends.  Sure, I can go back the menu - but I've seen this before occassionally and find it irritating.

Also, inside the box is a piece of see-through plastic with some artwork on it.  What the heck am I supposed to do with that??",1208390400,2,1953,4.42577030812325
3315000,3,B00127R2XI,"Fans of mecha-themed anime looking here for the next great series may be somewhat disappointed with what 'Aquarion' has to offer.  Coming from a great pedigree (created by Shoji Kawamori, who was involved with 'Escaflowne' and 'Macross' amongst others) the show initially seems to have plenty of promise but within the first 2 episodes fans of the genre will be slightly off-put by the derivative storyline and characters.  Which is really quite a shame because storyline aside 'Aquarion' is a very handsome series with terrific mech design and sprinkled throughout with some truly beautiful background art.

As for packaging goes, Funimation has done a great job in putting together a well-designed set with each of the 3 discs housed in their own wonderfully illustrated slimpack cases.  A transparent pencil board is also nicely included and packed within the slipcase.  As expected ample extras are also included (all on disc 3).  They include:

+Clean, opening and ending segments
+6 minute interview with Shoji Kawamori
+18 minute fan Q&A session with Kawamori and voice cast
+4 shorts examining the themes of the show

Video and Audio quality are also consistently excellent throughout.  The English voice track is also done very well and encoded in 5.1 Dolby.  Sadly, the superb Japanese track is only available in 2.0 Stereo.",1208390400,,1334,5.162790697674419
3315001,3,B00127R2XI,"Throughout all the reviews you will see over and over again the comparison to Neon Genesis Evangelion. This isn't just a passing similarity. There are a bunch of major plot points that come right out of NGE:

- World wide catastrophe that decimated the earth
- Aliens called Angels invading and trying to take over the world
- A Mysterious government agency that is defending the earth from the Angels
- Humans using alien technology that they found but don't quite understand to fight back
- Young pilots with personal problems using the alien technology/giant robots
- A Mysterious project leader that seems to have ulterior motives that no one can figure out.

These similarities alone do not make Aquarion good or bad but they do raise the bar. For me they were distracting and I had to get past them to take in Aquarion as it's own anime. I wasn't as gripped or intrigued as I was when I watched NGE. A lot of anime (especially Japanese ones) can take quite a few episodes to hit their stride. There can my mysteries and plot lines that take many episodes to resolve so maybe this will happen here.

Overall, this anime seems to be targeted more towards the action packed anime audience. It feigns depth but it's really not all that deep. It's fun to watch, but doesn't seem destined to become a classic.",1208390400,,1309,4.585470085470085

The action revolves around the use of sophisticated machines that are controlled by gifted young pilots called Elements who can fight the Shadow Angels. When they work together as a team of three they can defeat the shadow angels cherubim which also manifest as giant fighting machines (kind of like transformers)

The storyline and the character development is what makes this a very engaging and interesting anime. The teammates have complex backgrounds and relationships and it is interesting seeing them develop their abilities. Some of the elements remember their past lives and so that adds a dimension of interest, particularly when there's a potential for reuniting past romantic partners. My husband, son and I watched this series together and we all really liked it.

My son said "" I think it was a great anime and I really enjoyed watching it. It's a very action filled series and it's got a great storyline.""

3315004,3,B00127R2XI,"I've been a fan of Anime for a number of years now but generally prefer more detailed and/or feature-length productions. And watching Aquarion reminded me of exactly why that is. The plot, as many of the reviewers have mentioned, is a fairly recycled one, with elements from other series like Voltron and Neon Genesis Evangelion. I have nothing against recycled concepts though...not if they are well-done and bring something new and interesting. But that just was not the case here. What I found most unsettling about this series was the rather strong religious overtones (from an enemy called the ""Angels"" to the mecha robots requiring three (a trinity) of pilots to combine, the main character being a reincarnation of some ""messiah"" character, etc.) juxtaposed against some fairly unheroic and unpleasant characters. Perhaps there is more character growth in the future episodes. But taking just this Part 1 on its own merits, this group just seems to be constantly fighting and bickering and it's hard to enjoy a show when you don't really feel like you have some ""good guys"" to root for. The ""possession"" of the central character Apollo I found eerily creepy in a lot of ways, there just didn't seem to be enough back story and explanation of it for it to truly stand up on its own and make much sense. And that seemed to be the case for a lot of what is going on in these episodes. I do think the serial nature of this is where things tend to fall apart. Not that you can't have good anime series, you certainly can. But it seems like it keeps trying to squeeze in all these character lines while still fitting in a big fight sequence in each episode and the character back-story and development suffers as a result, leaving the watcher often confused and somewhat unfulfilled.

Having said all that, the animation here is top-notch and quite a treat to watch just for the technical nature of it. The soundtrack/music is also very well done. I appreciate the well-done packaging of the box set (takes up minimal space compared to some other hefty box sets) and really dedicated anime fans will probably appreciate owning this regardless of the flaws. If you are new to anime though, I'd suggest passing on this, and looking at other, better shows.",1208304000,2,2254,4.75

8244619,4,B00127R2XI,"If you're purchasing the second half of Aquarion that means you've probably finished the first, and if that's the case you might be wondering how they are going to wrap up the show in only thirteen remaining episodes.  Don't fear that the show has been rushed, they pack a lot of the humor that you're accustomed to in with the plot and manage to end the series very well.

Aquarion never was a series stingy on production value, and you do not have to worry that the aspects of the show aside from the story will become rushed either.  It is still a series without a badly drawn episode, there is no jarring change to the art (minus an episode where that is the intention) or the quality of the music.  They put the same amount of care in blending the CG with traditional animation that you found in the first half of Aquarion.

If you've made it this far in the series you surely understand that Aquarion is taking some of the things we as anime fans love the most about the different genres and trying to make it new.  They also blend in the things that we may find annoying, and in true Aquarion style they blow everything out of proportion to make the entire anime sparkle with the sort of ""in your face"" attitude that this series should be appreciated for.  That may not be your cup of tea; if you're looking for something wholly original (if that is truly possible) - Aquarion won't provide that.  What it will offer you is the running gags, over the top characters, sumptuous art, minor fan-service and seemingly misplaced sound effects you've become accustomed to over your journey through different anime.

The creators managed to wrap the series up very well, they carefully push the plot forward building on the characters you have grown to know throughout the first half of Aquarion.  It should be noted that you may not learn all that you wanted to about the Shadow Angels as individuals, but that is perhaps the best way to handle them in Aquarion.  They are meant to be mysterious, but we learn enough about them to begin to understand their motivations and emotions, which may have seemed Spartan or overly cryptic during the first half.  We also learn more about our favorite characters beyond their personal idiosyncrasies, which is often amusing and at times touching.  While it may be hard - upon reaching the last episode - to fully appreciate the ending of the show with time it does seem to be the best way to wrap up the series.

While the finale of Aquarion isn't the very best ending, it does a good job of tidying up the loose ends you may have felt were floating through the series.  It isn't necessarily a satisfying conclusion, but it is a completion, a continuance, and it leaves the viewer with room to extrapolate their own meaning.  I don't personally think that's terrible.

This is another slim pack, but the discs include heavy extras from text-less songs and music video, to several episodes with commentary.  If you're looking for the printed media extras you found in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aquarion-Season-1-Part-1/dp/B00127R2XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aquarion: Season 1, Part 1</a>&nbsp;you may be momentarily disappointed.  I know that I was, until I sat back and wondered what more they could have put in to the second half to satisfy me when they provided so much with the first.  The actual digital extras should be enough to satisfy.  As with the first half of the show I cannot testify as to the quality of the dub, I don't personally care for them and so never watched it in anything other than Japanese with English subtitles.

Overall it's a solid series that will appeal to those who want to relive the shows of our youth or the early days of our anime exploration.  The beauty of the series is that for all of the shows it cribs from it manages to do things differently enough to be called: Aquarion, and not part 2, 3, or 4 of another series.",1298073600,,3953,4.713662790697675
8244620,5,B00127R2XI,"Aquarion is a wonderful anime.  As of writing this review you can now purchase the full series in one box set which is far more economical than purchasing the series in two parts however if you liked Aquarion the price difference will not compare to what you get when you buy it in two parts.  There is more art both on the box and in the box when you purchase in two pieces which is a redeeming factor for fans.  The quality of both the subtitled original and the dubbed version is wonderful and I am not personally a fan of dubs.  Either way you choose to watch Aquarion you are going to have a good experience.

The art is well done and the theme songs are both well chosen, you aren't going to run into the series and be turned off by the soundtrack - everything blends together well.  You won't find scenes where characters are suddenly not drawn properly, there was no haste or cutting of corners in this production and it's very clear from the outset that this is a quality series.

Aquarion is not going to be for everyone.  I found that older anime fans that have grown up watching mecha (or younger anime fans that enjoy the genre) are going to relate to Aquarion and find the beauty of this series.  It is not original; it's homage, a mash up of all the funny, amusing, beautiful, and distinct parts of many different series.  This makes it wonderful to watch.  It can evoke your memories of Voltron, remind you of X, Macross (also by the same director), Robotech (another derivative piece of great merit), and even Evangelion.  It can be a serious show (the very pretense of the series is of great severity) and a comedic masterpiece.  The humor to be found in the joining of the three smaller ships to make Aquarion Mars, Sol, and Luna - the characters have an orgasm every time it's ""good"" - and the conversations between characters because of this is great and a small part of the comedy.

The star-crossed lovers theme is done a hundred times, and while Aquarion doesn't do it any better this isn't a series that is trying to.  I didn't go into this series looking for it to be something new and innovative, and I didn't come out of it feeling that way.  It's just beautiful to listen to, to see, and to remember which the power of this series is: the ability of Aquarion to bring back your fondest memories of anime long past.  It is by no means a show that takes itself seriously and right when you think it might be something crazy and off the wall happens to remind you that it's humor.  There is action in the show and the battles are well done, there is that level of gravity to it.  It's well thought out and well planned, and really if you look at Aquarion for what it appears to be trying to achieve it did a fantastic job.

Characters are well defined, even if their back story isn't all that it possibly could be.  Through the series and part one in particular we learn more about the past lives of the characters and their current incarnation.  There is a very clear foreshadowing of what is to come in Aquarion.  So for those who want to reminisce on many anime at once and even more to experience all the little things that made multiple series great presented in one go this is a must purchase.  For those who want to experience something that has many different threads woven together; the serious, the humorous, the battles and the mayhem, this is also a must purchase.  Aquarion is what the mecha genre needs: a good jab in the ribs.",1279065600,3,3467,4.388106416275431
8244621,5,B00127R2XI,"i love the series of Aquarion, i watched the whole thing online, and just had to buy it all. The starts out a little confusing, but as time goes buy you get to know and really like certain characters. My favorite has to be the developing relationship between silvia, and apolla, two of the main characters, if you don't like the first episode as much, give it more of a chance, because the comedy and mystery come into play in later episodes. if you like star-crossed lovers, then you will like aspects of this anime.",1264809600,,517,4.4526315789473685
8244622,3,B00127R2XI,"A decent show, but nothing to set it apart.

Aquarion takes place 11 years after a great disaster destroys most of Earth. Along with the destruction came beings called Shadow Angels who have been asleep for thousands of years, and begin to harvest humans and extract their life force. Ordinary human weapons are ineffective against the Shadow Angels, that's where the organization called Deava comes in creating machines to fight against the Dark Angels called Vectors. The Vectors can also combine to form a giant robot. The story takes off years later and follows Apollo who might be a reborn hero from thousands of years ago.

I'm going to begin with the things I didn't like about the show than to the things I did like.

1. This show just seemed to blend RahXephon, Eureka Seven and Evangelion together and this is what came out. I know the creators of this series were trying to tell a story, it just didn't work, it just didn't make much sense. This was the part that brought down the series for me, maybe if I hadn't seen the shows above I might have enjoyed it more.

2. The other thing that I didn't like was the soundtrack which didn't add anything to the series.

Onto the good.

1. The best part of the series were the characters. I'll focus mainly on Apollo who was a great main character. He was enjoyable to watch and you will just plain like him. You will like him more as the series goes on and watch him develop. There were other good characters in Silvia, Hong Lihua who I found very interesting, Pierre, and the rest. Each brought something to the series.

2. The other thing that I liked was the animation done by I think Satelight, I could be wrong. Anyway I thought it was very good, and added to the series.

Overall a decent series that recycles themes from other disaster anime.",1240704000,2,1805,4.4984709480122325
8244623,4,B00127R2XI,"With titles such as Macross Plus and Escaflowne to his credit, it really comes as no surprise that mere mention of the name Shoji Kawamori stirs up excitement in mecha anime lovers such as myself.  His latest creation, Aquarion, is the culmination of lessons learned from his previous endeavors coupled to the charm of a simpler time in animation.  The plot, while not overly complex nor edited to appear more complicated than necessary, combines just the right elements of solid story telling to make Aquarion unique among a rich field of competitors.

The story's pretty straight forward: A Great Catastrophe has left the world in ruin and an ancient race of alien beings called the Shadow Angels have taken advantage of the weakened state of humanity to begin their assault on the planet (after 12,000 years of laying low).  Earth's last hope and greatest defense against the threat comes in the form of the Mechanical Angel Aquarion.  For those rolling their eyes at the fact that this story has been seemingly told again and again, take heart in the fact that this isn't just another cookie cutter giant robot show.  In fact some of the nuances that make Aquarion unique among its competition can truly be called influential enough to spawn legions of imitators for years to come.

About the best way to describe the program would be to compare it to the shows it most closely emulates:  Take the heavy mythological elements of RahXephon, combine them with the level of fun that made early 1980s giant robot shows so magical (think Vehicle Voltron) and finally top it all off with the victimized human element of The Matrix for good measure.  If none of these comparisons strike a chord with your ability to decide whether or not Aquarion is right for you, read on.  I'll break the show down on its own merit throughout this review.  If however you are in fact familiar with the above analogies, there need not be another word said to influence your decision:  This is giant robot action meets Atlantian mythology all done up in the crisp animation standards of today.  In that regard it's worth the nostalgic undertones alone.

Perhaps the show's greatest contribution to the entire genre is the robot Aquarion itself.  Sure the concept of three ultra-capable jet fighters (in this case called Vectors) combining to form a massive butt-whipping mecha is nothing new, the idea that the end result is completely dictated by the personalities of the three pilots involved certainly is.  Known here as Elements, the individuals charged with the task of saving all of humanity one wild mechanized fistfight at a time play a far deeper role than simply glorified fighter pilots.  Indeed this series makes interesting use of the concept of a person's aura as, depending on the combination of the three Elements involved in the conjunction, the Aquarion itself can basically take on limitless forms.  Sorry Voltron, a single character isn't delegated the role of ""forming the head"" here but rather the position is up for grabs among the three Elements chosen to go out and do battle.  Depending on which one snags the responsibility, Aquarion unites into a unique mode with special abilities including everything from archery, to the leg dexterity of a pro soccer player, to a punch with near endless reach.

Even cooler is that each Aquarion configuration has its own name, color motif and unique look.  Part of the fun, especially early on, is determining each build's strengths and weaknesses.  Aquarion literally becomes the personification of the ""head"" character's personality.

Villains in the show are standard fair aliens; humanoid beings bent on global conquest with a slightly ""classic mythological"" depth about them which is nice as it offers a unique contrast to the often-times bubbly nature of the cast of teenage good guys.

Perhaps the depth of the enemy is greatest realized in the 7th episode of the show, Knight of the Crimson Rose.  Here the viewer is treated to a bit of art (poetry to be exact) and the consequence that negative emotion can inflict.  The Shadow Angles capitalize on the arrogance and confidence of Aqaurion's pilots, literally forcing them to find strength through their weakness and fear.

About the oddest element this series brings to the genre would have to be the combination sequence itself.  Since, as stated above, Aquarion interlocks not only mentally and physically but energetically as well, the show goes to great measures to illustrate the almost orgasmic sensation the pilots experience as they merge both with one another and the machine as well.  While undeniably unique, it is a gimmick that is perhaps taken a bit far throughout the course of the 26 episodes.  Especially since juvenile sexual references often pop up here and there with younger inexperienced pilots looking for what basically boils down to a sex-ed conversation from their superiors.  However, I should note for sensitive viewers and concerned parents alike that the references are never pornographic or off color.  The Mature rating that the show carries is certainly on the conservative side of the spectrum as really there is little here in the way of explicit violence, language, and so on.

Packaging of Aquarion is a bit of a mixed bag.  On the one hand this is a Funimation Entertainment release which, in case you aren't familiar, means the property is treated like a piece of fine art.  The box, jacket, and disc art is simply top notch all the way.  I often go on record as saying that with many companies you are simply buying dvds, with Funimation, you are immersing yourself in the total experience.  Aquarion is no exception to this trend (although I will say that the inclusion of books as was the case with Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid would have been absolutely clutch).  Even still, the set is spaced out across five thin pack discs and includes a pair of 5x7 pencil boards that are every bit as gorgeous as is the show itself.  The trouble is that Funimation has yet to release a single boxed set of the series, instead forcing viewers to purchase two volumes; the first of which contains 13-episodes across three discs and the second with the final 13-episodes spaced across two discs.  Cost for both volumes is just about the same as ADV Films' single-box release of RahXephon (which is also a 26 episode series). Hence obviously pricing isn't an issue so much as it's simply inconvenient for buyers to have to track down two sets rather than one.

But I digress, back to the meat and potatoes of the show itself; the animation is spot-on throughout the entire series with a lush color pallet and spectacular textures.  I mentioned the occasional depth displayed by the aliens but the intelligence behind their attacks pales in comparison to the mecha battles themselves.  Releasing giant machines called Cherubims to the planet's surface, it is these skeletal-inspired beauties that Aquarion finds himself clashing with time and time again.  In all honesty whatever shortcomings the plot suffers from (occasional tangents that do little to advance the overall prose) are more than made up for by the beautiful battle sequences.  The battles maintain their status as spectacles to behold right on through to the end. The subdue Shadow Angel designs and sharp lines make for an awesome counterpoint to Aquarion's fluid curves and brighter color pallet.

Finally the series boasts a beautiful, moving musical score by Yoko Kanno.  Think Escaflowne here with soaring orchestral pieces often infused with dramatic vocals.

In all, some criticize Aquarion for its inability to match the psychological depth of comparative shows such as RahXephon and Evangelion but I suspect that Shoji Kawamori's plan was to avoid falling into the pitfalls that plague such shows by resetting the proverbial clock on what makes good robot anime great.  As such he makes it a very deliberate point to counteract the darker moments of the prose with an energetic and likeable main cast, creepy enemies with a bright, larger than life giant robot defender; splashes of light for every shadow.

Aqaurion is an enjoyable self-sustained series that does far better when judged on its own merits rather than it does by comparing it to similar entries.  This is all made even better by the fact that it was released by Funimation- which means its loaded with extras and the attention to detail is without rival.",1239408000,,8432,4.94889992902768
