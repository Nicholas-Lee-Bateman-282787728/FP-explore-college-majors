8032773,1,B0002VERTM,"This DVD series is so disappointed. I could not believe my eyes when I put this piece of garbage in my DVD player. It's a very annoying DVD. It's almost $30 and it's only 26 minutes.

They try to make the subject funny, but with only 26 minutes of run time there is not much teaching just comedy. The beginning is very annoying, you can't skip it and there is no menu.

It looks like a DVD my grandma would create and she is 85 years old. Horrible, horrible DVD.

The only good thing....I'll get back to you when I find one.",1184630400,3,524,4.117647058823529
