7881875,5,6305071306,"One of my all time best loved movie. It is worth getting, so I can watch it over and over again. It is a hard to find title but worth it.
It is very funny and with good stars in it. A new twist to robot and human interaction.",1294012800,,225,3.6122448979591835
7881876,5,6305071306,I can't believe how much they did with such a small budget.  A ton of fun!  Especially recommended for fans of Jerry Doyle.,1012780800,2,123,4.304347826086956
7881877,1,6305071306,"Whooo! I don't know what movie that first guy was seeing- maybe he got a directors cut or something-but this was bad. I mean especially bad.
