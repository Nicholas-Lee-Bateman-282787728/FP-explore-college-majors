8240253,5,B001140SDI,"I have been practicing Wai Lana Yoga for over 20 years. I started with her TV series when I was still in China. After I came to the US, I was so pleasantly surprised to find her Yoga DVDs readily available here.  I have her Hello Fitness tripack, and then Fun Challenge Tripack.  I am not particularly flexible, and each pregnancy made me stop praciting for close to a year. But after some time of recovery, I can follow typically about 90% of the Hello Fitness and 60-70% of the Fun Challenge moves. I swim 1km and run 4-5 miles regularly, but every time I practice Wai Lana's Yoga, I can feel it in my joints and muscles the next day (in the good way).

Compare to other Yoga or Pilate DVDs, I love the fact that Wai Lana's Yoga is absolutely relaxing and strengthening at the same time. Her moves are slow, yet allow you to adjust the intensity to as demanding as your body can take. Some people don't like her makeup, but I think her makeup is quite modest and I love her facial expression. She always look quite calm, which remind me to maintain my inner peace.  This is perhaps what other DVDs are missing.

I heard she travels through the world to film her DVDs, and this shows: There are different scenes (ocean, mountain, etc).  In addition, she wears Yoga practice outfits designed by herself. None of her outfits is tight-fitting or binding. Quite the contrary: They seems to be made of pure cotton and are all quite loose-fitting. You hardly even see her skin except for those filmed at tropical area.  Sometimes I wish she sells some of her Yoga outfits rather than natural snacks, although I am quite comfortable practicing her Yoga in pajamas, any time of the day!

If I have to limit the number of DVDs I can keep at home, her Yoga DVDs will be the last I give up.

I only wish there will be video streaming available, so I can follow her Yoga on my smartphone.",1387929600,3,1877,4.370689655172414
