6817795,3,B00PLYU5PU,"This animated feature borrows on the famous stories of carrier pigeons used by the allies during WWI to convey messages and intelligence.  This should have been a rich history to draw on for a great story.  The film has decent animation and voice acting, but perhaps lacks the substance to take it one or two levels higher.  No doubt there are enough antics and story to entertain young children, so I am not saying the movie is awful.  The movie has a terrific moral and overall I give it positive marks.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Tourbillion is a young carrier pigeon growing up on a farm with other pigeons and many animals.  WWI is on, but has not effected them that much yet.  One day, it is announced their little farm will be turned into a training center for pigeons going to the front to aid in the cause by conveying messages.  It is a ragtag group of the old and goofy, but little Tourbillion is determined to play his part, despite his age and small stature.  Together with his cast of motley friends, the fate of soldiers will lie on their small shoulders.  They will have to endure a barrage from enemy soldiers, planes, and a squadron of evil birds of prey led by the infamous Red Falcon.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  As I said, the voice acting is reasonably good.  However, it lacks the greatness and substance that endears the characters to viewers on a deeper level.  There are a few songs in the show, but I can't say I even found them catchy.  I would definitely not bill it as a good musical cartoon, but those songs were few and far between.  I did like the yodeling geese and actually enjoyed them more than most parts of the show.  If you just want something to pop in and entertain the kids, this might do the trick.  I am sure there will still be fans because everyone has different tastes.  I suggest a rental for anyone who is curious.  I don't suggest a blind purchase.",1422921600,6,1888,4.414492753623189
