5339824,5,B009IDGMMK,"If you like football, are sensitive to tragedy, and fond of human spirit, I think you will like it.
It's not exactly about football in the end, often about gritty struggle of survival and about either listening to the call of the wild, or not.",1406764800,,243,4.4222222222222225
5339825,5,B009IDGMMK,"I was surprised to find such mediocre ratings of this film on Rotten Tomatoes, where many of the professional critics disparage the film for some of its cinematic cliches and hard to believe plot twists. Had I not lived in Venezuela for 5 years, I might have agreed with them, but sadly, the violence in this film is a pretty accurate reflection of life in the barrios of Venezuela, especially Caracas. The film, full of references that Venezuelan audiences would get, also relates themes such as honor, love of family, and vigilante justice which are very much the essence of Venezuelan culture. I'm also not a particularly huge fan of 'futbol', but the soccer scenes in this film are quite enticing.  That is not to say that non-Venezuelans would not appreciate this film - if you can look beyond some of the melodramatic coincidences and empathize with the current experiences of people trying to make a living in places like Catia, I think you will also find this a very poignant and powerful film about the trade-offs between sacrificing on behalf of loved ones who died versus sacrificing for those loved ones still alive.",1398297600,4,1128,4.814432989690721
5339826,5,B009IDGMMK,"The beginning of the film, the find of an abandoned infant, is as emotionally striking as the ending of the film; and through the story it weaves through the many times told scenes of the tough, brutal, and lawless lives of poor communities throughout Latin America and other parts of the world, yet told with a different nuance, naturalness and vividness which makes the viewing interesting. The film's acting, cinematography, and staging is remarkable; and, since it is centered around soccer, it provides a very close insight about the passion of the game, in very well choreographed scenes and shots, of film and of the ball, and presents it as it is, one of the only routes out of the characters predicament. But the movie is not about soccer, it is about human character, its vicissitudes, and its redeeming aspects from within our humanity.",1381017600,2,847,4.888888888888889
5339827,4,B009IDGMMK,"Nice film of two brothers who play football to get out of their poor life in Venezuela. Really moved pictures, for ones who like films with brotherhood.

Everyone who looks for a film for a film night with the brother - perfect!",1373932800,,320,4.440677966101695
5339828,3,B009IDGMMK,"One of those movies that gets your interest at the beginning, but then sort of drags in the middle. I started watching it and shut it off half way through as it lost my attention in the middle of the movie. I was glad I finished it the following night as the ending was a bittersweet surprise.",1365292800,,293,4.157894736842105

8541802,5,B009IDGMMK,"Raised in Europe, I am much more fond of soccer that American football.  I saw this DVD at my local library and since I love foreign movies, I was drawn to see a film from Venezuela that had a story about soccer as a subtly weaving story of a movie.  In most poor countries, sports is a sure way to gain financial security.  Unable to secure education, it is sure way to avoid misery of poverty that looms over large majority of people.

So the story begins when one day a young woman and her toddler son come across abandoned baby left in a pile of garbage.  Young woman is without husband and poor and surely cannot afford to raise another child, but her heart goes out to a crying infant who she and her son Julio  adoringly call ""Gato"" (Cat) because he was crying like a kitten when they found him abandoned.  16 years later, two boys are raised as brothers and they both call the woman Mother since she raised them both with everything she's got.  While Julio is big boy, strong with abundance of girlfriends and large group of friends, Daniel (Gato) is quiet, gentle, skinny kid with kind of gentle kindness that is rare to find.  Boys love to spend time together, they play soccer at the local club and have a kind of bond that even biological brothers do not have.  Julio is protective of his little brother and Daniel, living quietly in a shadow of his big brother is thinking of ways they can overcome their poverty and make their mother proud.

One day, tragedy strikes and it is only days before boys are preparing for tryout to play soccer a the national team.  Tryouts and potential pick for the team would be their way out of ghetto in which they were raised.  While Julio is consumed with rage, grief and rebellion, Daniel is pouring his heart and soul into getting them picked for the soccer team.  And that is when story starts to unfold.  Daniel's little body is full of love for his adopted family.  He will do everything to preserve the only people in his life he can call family and at the same time he wants honorable and decent life for all of them.  His kindness is so overwhelming when one day he accepts to go to the abortion clinic with a girl he likes when she asks him to be her escort when she goes to a clinic to have an abortion although he was never her boyfriend and managed kiss her only once.  It is ironic that a boy who was abandoned in a pile of garbage would accompany her to a clinic for such reason and as they wait their turn to see a doctor, he gently talks her out of procedure.  It is uncanny when one day when he runs into her, she tells hi she told her parents about being pregnant and she decided to keep a baby and see what happens.  She tells him her only regret is that Daniel is not the father.

That is the core of him.  Daniel is good, pure, gentle, decent, honest - he has a soul of an angel.  So one day when he is told that he has nothing left but soccer - Daniel is devastated.  The life he always wanted with people he always wanted to be surrounded with is ripped away with him with one single statement.  And it is at that point that the end of the film is the explosion of emotions that left me crying for days end.  This story and actors who played it out so beautifully, broke my heart.  After the movie was over, I was left feeling devastated - that is how power the film was.

There is a part of the film when boys coach teaches them very valuable lesson.  During important soccer game during half time, boys are demoralized because the opposing team is leading 2:0.  Anyone who knows soccer, it seems impossible to reverse the game.  But their coach tells them that life is full of defeats and disappointments that creep up when we least expect it.  The only way to beat it is to remember every day that one has imagine that the game just started and the score is 0:0.  Only with such attitude, once can make a difference in the life - the own and lives of others.

Must see movie.  Even the people who do not like subtitles will not regret watching this film.  It is  film not just about soccer, but about friendship, loyalty, family, love, human condition and so much more.",1435017600,,4144,4.266666666666667
