2683254,1,B000K7LOJY,I ordered two DVDs by this dancer.  One locked up entirely so that it could not be played.  The other played a bit but skipped and froze as well.  Very poor quality DVDs and amateurish content.  A waste of money!,1241395200,2,212,4.225
2683255,5,B000K7LOJY,"Great instructions. execises she includes are very helpful. This is great for beginers(like me), but she actually takes you through two choreographies, so would be a good thing to have if you just want a new routine! FUN!!!",1231027200,4,223,4.894736842105263
2683256,5,B000K7LOJY,"I have always loved watching Flamenco!  Now I'm learning it!  I have been stomping, snapping and twirling around the house for two days now! I love that the background is white, completely, so that you can see all of her movement.  She teaches a beautiful, passionate dance in a manner that will give you confidence to start dancing right away.  Her mantons (shawls) are some of the most beautiful I have seen!  If you have always wanted to Flamenco, get this DVD and get started!",1216771200,9,480,4.6
2683257,5,B000K7LOJY,"I purchased this DVD with the intent to learn basic Flamenco as well as get a little exercise.  I am also a Spanish teacher and I've always loved Flamenco, the dance of the Spanish gypsies.

Puela Lunaris is a wonderful teacher.  She wears dark clothing and is contrasted by a pure white background.  You can see her very clearly.  She slowly explains everything you are doing, giving lots of details.  She wasn't vague and demonstrated exactly what you were supposed to be doing, which I believe would lessen the chance of injury.

I felt that I was the only student and that I was personally getting a lesson from her.  I was so impressed that I can't wait to buy the Sevillanas DVD.",1198108800,21,685,4.512195121951219
2683258,5,B000K7LOJY,"I've been performing and teaching both classical Spanish and Flamenco dance for over 20 years and purchased this DVD as one can't have enough background or reference.

This is a good DVD for a beginning student and I can recommend it with confidence.  But it's also great for the experienced dancer--Puela shares her knowledge beautifully and how can an experienced dancer not enjoy and appreciate how Puela shares generously what she knows and feels.

This is not the flamenco you see in Spain today, and Puela comments on this in her ""welcome""; but it shows the base of what we do, and sometimes it's sad that women may forget these graceful elements that are the heart of flamenco as they lean toward the more masculine expression.

Good job, Puela!",1193184000,24,752,4.8062015503875966
2683259,5,B000K7LOJY,"Campanilleros -Flamenco

This lady is an amazing, elegant dancer and a great instructor. Her calm and positive demeanor is drawing and the passion for her dance comes forth. I must admit when I began the program I was only curious.

The first segment teaches the very pure and feminine form of flamenco which a woman can dance alone, even barefooted.

Seven detailed combinations; beautiful choreography, almost sultry, with heavy concentration on hand rolls, arm movement and strict posture; the important elements in posture to allow for proper movement of torso and legs. Beautiful turns and tips on the ""quebrada"" similar to barrel turns. This program is full of substantial information that can be incorporated beautifully into the fusions of many dances, particularly helpful in my belly dance.

The second segment teaches the dance with the shawl or as referred by Peulla, "" Manton de Manila."" Proper hand positioning for manipulation of the ""manton,""  or shawl which is a beautiful, long, fringed-silk embroidered square  folded into a triangle. A woman wears this shawl over her shoulders and uses it as a dance prop. Nine beautiful combinations, that  take you step by step into Puella's exciting journey into basic flamenco steps to emphasize the beauty of dancing with a shawl.

 As for me, my curiosity paid off. I stand before a mirror practicing with my own ""Manton de Manila!"" Gratzie Puella!",1171065600,35,1408,5.11353711790393

8154574,1,B000K7LOJY,This particular video does not teach Flamenco.  It teaches the use of a veil and some soft step movements while swirling the veil around.  Don't even bother buying the flamenco shoes--not needed.,1494806400,,195,5.0625

8154577,2,B000K7LOJY,"Whilst the teacher may be very knowledgeable, I didn't feel that this DVD was put together for beginners wanting to learn Flamenco. The was no review of steps to music, no repetition or drilling or break down of combinations. Would have been better if she was facing a mirror and the camera filmed her reflection as you have enough trouble trying to keep up yet alone reverse what she is doing. I bought both of her DVDs and I feel the same about both.  I think she is a performer and not a teacher - she needs someone to dissect what she is trying to teach and translate this into a format that is user friendly for people wanting to learn Flamenco.",1409702400,,650,4.327868852459017
8154578,4,B000K7LOJY,"Great for arm work and basic moves, but doesn't concentrate on footwork like I expected. Two dances are taught. She is barefoot in the first, and the second concentrates on shawl work.",1405987200,,184,4.78125
8154579,5,B000K7LOJY,"Beautiful  instruction, and easy to replay the areas you want to work on. Easy to follow, and aspire to dance this well.  Puela is a beautiful dancer.",1400716800,,150,4.518518518518518
8154580,1,B000K7LOJY,"I bought this as a way to practice some of my flamenco work. I should be teaching her. Wow, this was some of the worst technique I have ever seen in  flamenco dancer with her waving of the arms, or whatever it was. Hope she dances better than she teaches.",1355702400,,255,4.1
8154581,5,B000K7LOJY,"I enjoy all of her DVD's. She explains the steps clearly and simply. Makes it easy for us to follow. She is
a very good dancer and has a charming personality. I recommend it for those that are wanting to
expand their skills in Flamenco Dance.",1345507200,2,242,4.282608695652174
8154582,4,B000K7LOJY,"After learning the ""Gypsy Tangos"" choreography on one of Puela Lunaris' other DVDs, I was really looking forward to learning one of her Campanilleros choreographies, especially the first one. While the choreography itself is good, trying to learn it is more difficult in this DVD than the other one. The reason is 3-fold: 1) her fluid sense of timing is even more apparent in this DVD than the other. At one point, she even says the music is in 3/4 time when it is not. The time actually switches between 12/8 and 3/4, and the section where she makes that statement actually has a feel of 4 beats per measure rather than 3. What Lunaris does well is hit the accents at the end of the musical phrases, but her timing within each phrase is difficult to pin down. 2) The view of the instruction & performance is from the front only. While the white background is nice, it is difficult to watch and do simultaneously. A mirror image or view from the rear would be helpful. 3) There is no ""performance"" version of the choreography (as there is on her ""Gypsy Tangos"" DVD), so you only have one complete dance to study (and as I said, her timing on that is ""iffy"" at best). On the other hand, the moves are interesting and flow nicely from one to the other (if you can get past the timing issue), the price is great, and you can download the music for just $1.",1247961600,5,1353,4.373015873015873
