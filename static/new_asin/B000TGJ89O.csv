2898468,5,B000TGJ89O,"I decided to watch this film on a night when I was tired and unhappy. In about 5 minutes I was laughing out loud. I want to watch it again with friends....and yet again with whomever I can rope into the living room! John's humor is a great gift and his irreverence for the constraints of middle class morality and religion, refreshing.",1203033600,7,335,4.419354838709677
2898469,4,B000TGJ89O,"I enjoyed the JOHN WATERS: THIS FILTHY WORLD dvd. Part story telling--part stand-up comedy, Waters discuses the inspiration behind his movies, his relationship with cast members Divine and Edith Massey(among others), and why he got into film making in the first place.

Funny, intelligent, and off-the-wall John Waters is as colorful as his movies and he'll keep you entertained for the 86 minutes he's on stage.

For special features there's a lengthy Q&A with the audience.",1200441600,9,475,5.2368421052631575
2898470,5,B000TGJ89O,"I've loved John Waters and his work since the '70s, especially PINK FLAMINGOS and FEMALE TROUBLE, and this self-portrait video sounds great, but who approved the horrible painting on the DVD box?  It makes Waters looks like Dr. Sardonicus!  Good lord!",1197158400,5,251,5.097560975609756
2898471,5,B000TGJ89O,For Waters fans this is a must-see! For comedy fans this is a must-see! If you are not familiar with Waters this is a must-see. The man shoots from the hippest hip and is ON the entire time. He speaks from experience so the nutty fun just rolls out with snap and ease. A uniquely entertaining video self-portrait!,1196553600,12,313,4.413793103448276
2898472,5,B000TGJ89O,"John Waters has always been a hero of mine. In a world that's addicted to spin and drowning in BS laden rhetoric, his is one of the few genuine voices left that isn't afraid to tell Those Who Make The Rules where to go. If your familiarity with his work begins and ends with the most recent version of Hairspray (...which wasn't bad, I have to admit), This Filthy World will provide an excellent, and refreshingly honest, introduction to what motivates and inspires this creative legend. On the other hand, if you've seen Pink Flamingos more than a few times and aren't more than a few steps away from your beloved, dog-eared, copy of Crackpot,  it's still worth getting, if for no other reason than to watch him work the room and be himself.",1196208000,11,742,4.537313432835821
2898473,5,B000TGJ89O,I don't know why really but when I see a really good John Waters film I think it's the best thing ever. This film gives me the same feelings and it's just him talking or answering questions from the ultra-hip film student crowd in NYC.,1195776000,4,235,4.2444444444444445
2898494,5,B000TGJ89O,This was purchased as a Christm gift.  It arrived very quickly and the recipient was very surprised and delighted with it.,1357084800,,122,4.809523809523809
2898495,5,B000TGJ89O,A gift for my daughter...she loved it.  At least I think she loved it...she hasn't said otherwise.  I take that as a good sign.,1354924800,,127,4.25
2898496,5,B000TGJ89O,I first saw this when I woke up one night after forgetting to turn off the TV.  I was laughing and ended up watching until the end.  It's a great insight into his world and many celebrities that are much bigger now.,1339977600,2,215,4.095238095238095

2898498,5,B000TGJ89O,"If you like John Waters, you'll enjoy this documentary. It is simply him telling stories from his life. It is not nearly as ""tasteless"" as some of John's own movies. But it is great nonetheless!",1308700800,,194,4.571428571428571
2898499,5,B000TGJ89O,"If you are easily offended, don't watch John Waters: This Filthy World. If, on the other hand, you revel in delightful offensiveness, do not miss John Waters: This Filthy World. The stories about his parents, neighbors, fellow actors and more kept me hanging on his every word.

The first time I saw a John Waters' film, I turned to my friend and stated, ""I don't know who this guy is, but I can tell you he went to Catholic school."" Well, as it turns out, I was absolutely correct. His reaction to the Church's comments about him just about made me choke with laughter.

Everything about John Waters is just so genuine that you can't help but like him.",1300579200,4,653,4.4789915966386555

2898501,5,B000TGJ89O,"hysterical and fascinating!
this made me rent Polyester and Pink Flamingos
(both of which i completely love!)
i'd put This Filthy World up there with Delirious and Dressed to Kill,
because my friends and I will be quoting it for years.",1265846400,,235,4.7560975609756095
2898502,5,B000TGJ89O,"I've always been a fan of John Waters.  He was indie before it was cool, and always had a sense of humor that I found hilarious.  You can sense it in his movies across the years.  Now that he's much older and wiser and his career has come full circle of being a misfit to that of being a ""filth elder"" (as he says), we can look back with him on his life story and find inspiration and delight in creating our own filthy things.

I've had the privilage of seeing John Waters live in his theater tours a few years ago.  He is just as funny and entertaining then as he is now.  He has the whole audience in stitches, telling his tales of how weird people really are.  He tells the tales of his film inspirations, meeting his friends that would star in his indie to his mainstream movies, and encountering the myriad of oddities that have inspired him to create all that he has created.

A word of criticism?  In the question and answer period, the audience doesn't ask the funniest possible questions.  Then again, there was no control over that factor.  Waters is not filthy, he produces witty and clever commentary on celebrities, trends and all the things in between.  I was remembering the funniest thing I think I have ever heard him say, when the last question of the night was when someone shouted ""Who's the filthiest person alive?!"".  Without pausing for a moment, he said ""Michael Jackson! Thank you, good night!"" and left the house roaring.",1218499200,5,1448,4.480916030534351
2898503,5,B000TGJ89O,"John Waters has been honing his monologue on college campuses and other low-key circuits for years, and with the release of The Filthy World on DVD, you, too, can view the pencil-mustached director in your living room.  The DVD has over 70 minutes of material filmed in New York's Harry De Jur Playhouse on a stage featuring both a gigantic flower arrangement and a pile of trash.  Waters delivers a charmingly bizarre performance which touches on his childhood (he has a great relationship with his Catholic parents), his cinematic inspirations, his films and frequent collaborators (including Divine, Traci Lords, and Johnny Depp), and his own personal philosophies.

The performance is never foul and always engaging, full of humorous vignettes.  Waters tells us about his father's reaction to one of his early films:  ""It was pretty funny.  But I hope to never see it again.""  He explains that even Divine had limits:  ""The first time he met Richard Simmons, he felt homophobic.""  Waters himself also has limits.  ""A drug that makes you love everyone?"" Waters says of Ecstasy. ""Sounds like hell to me.""  This DVD is sure to delight long-time fans as well as inspire some new ones to explore the extensive John Waters film catalog.",1203206400,33,1234,4.970731707317073
8209143,5,B000TGJ89O,He's a genius. I don't only like this DVD because I attended the event and am featured in the Q&A. Get into the marvelous mind of John Waters!,1500854400,,142,4.107142857142857

8209146,5,B000TGJ89O,John Waters is a national treasure. His take on being a successful American is a tribute to his creativity and genius. Being different and successful is the American Dream.,1424995200,,172,4.9655172413793105
8209147,5,B000TGJ89O,I never seem to get tired of this DVD. John Waters has some brilliant insight into culture. He has an unusual view of the world and he shares it well here. A must have for John Waters fans.,1421020800,,189,4.0
8209148,5,B000TGJ89O,I saw him in person in Seattle and this DVD shows him as he lectures across America.  I am a big fan of John Waters.,1408924800,,116,3.64

8209150,4,B000TGJ89O,"Except for ""Serial Mom"", I'm not a John Water's fan. I do not think ""Pink Flamingos"" was the landmark film that everyone believes it to be. It was nothing more then a degenerate home film with transvestites, orifices, gays and fecal consumption. John Waters and his entourage engage in a lifestyle that I find deplorable. But I liked ""Serial Mom"" so much that I gave ""John Waters: This Filthy World"" a view and was completely surprised. It was very entertaining due to John Waters' almost ""innocent"" charm. I thought it was going to be a one man rant on stage about gay rights. But actually, it was a fun and informative monologue about a filmmaker's life, experience and dealings with people and situations throughout his career. What I liked about it was the natural, calm, homespun presentation. There seemed to be no real political agendas or issues he was trying to push. He's not trying to promote his lifestyle or judge anyone else. Waters is an appealing on stage story teller, weaving a mixture of Hollywood gossip, personal insight and humor in this one man show. Worth a view whether you are a fan or not.",1401580800,5,1116,4.698979591836735
8209151,5,B000TGJ89O,"If anyone desires to know John Waters as a director, complete with a glimpse into his life growing up in Baltimore, this is indeed your best bet. John's desire to surprise vs shock people and have them confront their blind devotion to conventionality is discussed in this one-man show with humor, wit, and blazing intellect. He will have you squirming and laughing at the same time, but you will come away from the experience definitely knowing the true measure of the man. In addition, the extras on the DVD include an at-home interview where you'll meet Bill, his ""son,"" as well as a question and answer period following his performance. A must-have for any John Waters fan!",1386979200,4,676,4.786324786324786
