2861477,1,B000R7I48Q,"I played this video and only the introduction worked.  I received 2 videos and neither one worked.  This video, NFL Greatest Follies is a flop, a follie-less follies of a video.  That's right, a football follies video filled with no football, no football players, no footage.  And watch out!  If you don't stop the video, the introduction will play over and over again.  What great Fun!  So if you want to play a video for your children or in home pet, see how many times they will watch the introduction play over and over again before they become disinterested.  Good job Amazon, for assuring great product quality.  d.t.",1250640000,,623,4.694444444444445
2861478,4,B000R7I48Q,"I'd score slightly higher than the other rater, but the liner notes on this DVD do suck.  You get no clue as to what's inside, and so you may be disappointed if you buy one, on faith, off the shelf.  Anyway, here's the deal with Volume #3.  There's two full-length follies programs, produced by NFL Films.  There's no bonus material.

1.  Legends of the Follies
  (title is a take off on ""Legends of the Fall"")
2.  Follies: The Next Generation

Both films are 21st Century versions of the popular and long-running Follies series, which began in the late 1960s.  If you're a Football Follies fan, you'll enjoy.  I am, and I do.  But I wish there were bonus material, like another edition of ""Lost Treasures"" series, included on other recent NFL Films DVDs.",1217030400,4,755,4.586466165413534
2861479,1,B000R7I48Q,"This DVD is boring.  I bought it hoping for some cool bloopers.  No luck.  Also, do not purchase it if you plan to watch it with children.  There is inappropriate language.  Even though the words are bleeped out; it doesn't take a lot to figure out what they are saying.",1201046400,12,270,4.32

8199352,1,B000R7I48Q,I ordered for a football-themed work function.  The guys like it.  The women thought it was pretty stupid.  Glad I only paid a buck.,1373760000,,132,4.416666666666667

8199354,5,B000R7I48Q,"If you think the players in the NFL are always perfect, think again.  This video and the others in the series show the lighter side of a rough game.",1354060800,,148,4.103448275862069
8199355,3,B000R7I48Q,"There's more than just stumbles and falls on this video (like a story about a super fan with disgusting 15 yr old food in the back of a breaking down Pinto), but still another fun video in the series.  My young boys get a kick out of watching them, but especially enjoy the first two in the Greatest Follies Series which has more bloopers and less ""stories"".",1262908800,,358,4.343283582089552
