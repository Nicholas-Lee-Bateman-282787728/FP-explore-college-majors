8206218,5,B000SPGMRW,"The DVD by Brenda Lee: Coming on Strong was taken from this VHS & if you have the chance, get the DVD because the VHS will lose sound & picture quality over the years. This show was great as usual as Brenda is a very talented singer. I've been a fan of hers since the Red Foley's Ozark Jubilee T.V. shows and when she came out with Sweet Nothin's I was very excited for her as she finally got the attention of the other teenagers that didn't know her, due to her record label (Decca) (even though most of her songs were R & R) of not giving her national promotions & radio play. She did have many hits in the 50's but not on the R & R radio stations.  This video was in perfect shape but when I purchased it, I didn't know that it was available under another title (on DVD). Not the seller's fault.  +JMJ+",1325548800,2,805,4.056603773584905
