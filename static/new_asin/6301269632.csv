I was so excited when I saw this, I bought 3!  You know, just in case!  One of the funniest and most ridiculous films EVER mad!  Everyone needs a copy!",1418515200,2,326,4.111111111111111

7811172,5,6301269632,"Off beat golan-globus film. Entertaining in its own light. I purchased this thinking it was related to the 88-89 sci fi series
HARD TIME ON PLANET EARTH.
although it wasnt,it still belongs in the cult classic status of other late 80s-early 90s low budget hits. This probably aired on USA up all night around that period.
Adam West really shines in this one.
A must add to your video collection
Definently deserves a DVD release.",1258243200,2,428,4.72
7811173,5,6301269632,"Adam West is a hoot!  Darrin Star's (Sex In The City) best writing sparkles under Charlie Matthau's (Walter's son) knowing direction.  A witty, funny, and charming film that was made for no money, and is a treasure waiting to be discovered.",1030752000,4,240,4.829268292682927
7811174,3,6301269632,"Doin' time is a funny and moving story of one teenager's attempts to fit in not only with his peers- but with the universe.  Along the way he gets a lot of advise and meets new and interesting friends(?)such as Adam West.  This is Charles Matthau's directorial debut, and he artfully leads the characters and audience in a dance of maybes and might-have-beens all the way to the end.  Humor abounds as everyday occurences are seen through a boy who just may be doing time on planet Earth.",986774400,4,488,4.5227272727272725
