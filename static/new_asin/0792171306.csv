137123,4,0792171306,I love this movie!  Nick Nolte and Mac Davis had me cracking up the entire movie.  I always thought athletes never touched drugs when I saw this as a little boy but now that I'm older and wiser I know that athletes  and drugs are definitely a reality.  This movie lifted up the pretty face  of the NFL and showed the ugliness inside.  I encourage any high school or  college coach to show this to their teams for the simple reason that the  NFL is not all power and glory.,952560000,2,472,4.166666666666667

137190,5,0792171306,"NORTH DALLAS FORTY (1979) is often compared to SEMI-TOUGH (1977) because they both take place in the late Seventies among similar Dallas-area pro football teams and rely on considerable star power in their casting.  However, they are really quite different:  SEMI-TOUGH is a romantic triangle in which the two males (Burt Reynolds, Kris Kristofferson) just happen to play pro ball and have their eyes on the ball-club owner's daughter (Jill Clayburgh) and even at that, most of the humor comes from send-ups of various contemporary therapies such as EST and Rolfing.  NORTH DALLAS FORTY is about the sport of pro football and the difficult physical and psychological demands it makes on its players, especially the leads played by Nick Nolte and singer Mac Davis.  It is much less of a satire and much more of a complaint about how the players are used for the owners' purpose, especially Nolte's character, who is not averse to taking pain-deadening shots to keep playing but is (spoiler) unwittingly used as a role model for a fellow player, who will not.  Of the two, my preference is for NORTH DALLAS FORTY because, despite its disco-era hair and dancing, it is less diminished by topical concerns.  Nolte is at the peak of his physical beauty and close to his peak in acting prowess (he had not yet made DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS); Mac Davis, as his buddy, is a good comedic foil; and the supporting cast includes such standouts as Charles Durning, G.D. Spradling, Dabney Coleman and the late John ""Tooz"" Matuszak.  The price for this no-frills DVD makes it very attractive.  Based on the best-selling novel by the late Peter Gent.",1463184000,,1640,4.853046594982079

137206,2,0792171306,"North Dallas Forty is a lot like reading a really bad break up note. The guy who wrote the book played for the Cowboys but had ambitions as a great writer. Unfortunately, he had a bitterness that seems to have soaked up most of his talent and then had a movie made by people of a similar mindset.

Ted Kotcheff films run on bitterness and Nick Nolte was so bitter about being told how handsome he was that he's spent a lifetime trying to live it down culminating in a hilarious mug shot. Combine those 2 bitter guys with a writer who is bitter and you get a bitter movie that can't even stop to have any fun. In fact, you can see the seeds of a better film in there but impressively the film constantly chooses to undermine it by focusing on the most bitter parts of the story with a fierce tunnel vision. It'd be fine too except surprisingly the film deviates from the original book and gives you a moment that is completely unearned in the wake of everything that came before it.

For his part, Nolte nails it. He's great. I called him bitter earlier but he's nuanced and intelligent in his acting. He doesn't present a single focused jerk who thinks the world is out to get him. He plays against the writing on the page whether he meant to or not and gives us a better character than what could've been. He's the reason why this has 2 stars and frankly Nolte will almost always add at least 2 stars to any review.

Basically, the movie isn't near as smart as it thinks. I could let it slide if it weren't for the fact there's more there. It just never is capitalized on due to the small mindedness of the director and writer.",1453852800,,1628,4.262135922330097

137231,3,0792171306,"Released in 1979, North Dallas Forty stars Nick Nolte and Mac Davis as receiver and quarterback for the fictitious North Dallas Bulls professional football team. G.D. Spradlin excellently plays the austere coach who won't tolerate lone wolfs on his team. Charles Durning plays his assistant and Steve Forrest & Dabney Coleman the wealthy owners of the team. Marshall Colt plays the young up-and-coming secondary quarterback whos also devoutly Christian and eventually soiled by other members of the team. Various NFL players are on hand, such as Bo Svenson and John Matuszak.

The film plays like a docudrama and attempts to show the grim reality of professional football and what it takes to be a champion team. Its more of an adult drama than a sports movie and therefore lacks the typical sports movie formula. The plot revolves around the team members preparing for a big divisional championship with the fictitious Chicago Marauders, which takes place in the third act, but the game footage is limited to the last two minutes of the game. After this, theres still 20 minutes left where Noltes character is confronted by the office big wigs. They have evidence that he was regularly smoking weed in his off-time, which of course was illegal back then. He responds by understandably pointing out that the team docs keep pumping all kinds of drugs into the players on a regular basis so they can play despite pretty serious injuries. Whats that compared to smoking a little pot? Its a good scene and effectively shows the idiocy and hypocrisy of the accusations. John Matuszak, who plays O. W. Shaddock, ironically died a mere ten years after this movie was released at the young age of 38 due to an accidental overdose of propoxyphene, a pain-reliever that is now outlawed in the USA and Europe. According to the managerial staff in the movie its okay to take these kinds of drugs, but by golly you better not be caught smoking a joint! (Dont get me wrong here; Im not into marijuana, but if it trips your trigger whats that to me?).

The female cast is limited to fairly small roles by Dayle Haddon (Charlotte) and Savannah Smith Boucher (Joanna), both good-lookin but rather plain and neither curvy enough for my tastes. Being a football movie youd expect some cheerleader sequences or something. Nope, nada. Needless to say, weak job on the female front.

BOTTOM LINE: This is an okay adult drama about the grim realities of professional football, as well as the perks. The story is moderately interesting but never full-on compelling. Moreover, the characters aren't all that interesting, although Spradlin shines as the coach and Noltes good as the cynical and burning out protagonist.

The film runs 119 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, CA.

137283,3,0792171306,"Nick Nolte stars in this brutally honest entertainment about one man*s rebellion against the bureaucratic, manipulative world of professional football.
  Based on the popular novel by former Dallas Cowboy Peter Gent, NORTH DALLAS FORTY depicts Nolte as an aging ballplayer who, through a woman he meets(Dayle Haddon), is drawn away from the masculine, violent world in which he has lived so long.
  In doing so, he finds himself at odds with the team*s managment.
  The excitement, humor and drama of NORTH DALLAS FORTY is heightened by its meticulous attention to the details of a football player*s private and public life and its authenticity on the playing field.

137287,5,0792171306,"Right up there with ""Bull Durham"" or ""Slapshot"", this movie is hilarious, but it's also down and dirty. Based on the book by Peter Gent, the viewer gets to see what really goes on behind the closed doors of the NFL, specifically the Cowboys, in the 70s. And I gotta tell ya, it really is remarkable how relevant this flick still is. For the most part, it could have been made today. I was thinking as I watched: ""Well any NFL player who saw this movie back in the day sure wouldn't have been in the dark as far as what they were getting into.""

Nick Nolte is perfect for this role, and Mac Davis is a freakin' riot. The coaches, the higher-ups, everyone is spot-on. It seems like the character Ogre from ""Revenge of the Nerds"" was inspired by the characters Joe Bob and O.W. from this flick.

137376,5,0792171306,"Nick Nolte, Mac Davis and G.D. Spradlin are absolutely fantastic in this outstanding film about the business of professional NFL football.  This is not a football film--it is a film about the big business of football.  Phil Elliot (Nolte) is an aging wide receiver with the mythical North Dallas Bulls (obviously modeled on the Dallas Cowboys.)  He is essentially rebelling against the cold-hearted businesslike approach of the team coach (G.D. Spradlin in one of his many great roles!).  ""None of you is as good as this computer!"" screams the coach ungratefully when Elliot deviates from the computerized play and scores the game winning touchdown.  The team owner admonishes Nolte with one of the greatest lines in any film: ""...seeing through the game is not the same thing as winning the game.""

This is a truly great movie.  The combination of humor (""lying can be really good for a relationship...!) and the cold-blooded ruthlessness of the team owners and coaches gives this film a gritty authenticity that is difficult to describe.  Nolte, Spradlin, and Davis are particularly excellent, but the supporting cast is equally good and propel this film into the ranks of the all-time greats.

I have read the book upon which this film is based, and it is good enough, but the screenplay here did things for the story that give it far more dimension than in the novel; a reversal of the usual state of affairs.  This one is not to be missed.  Not by anyone.  Highly recommended.",1265500800,2,1481,4.88

Aware of his position in a fundamentally corrupt system that demands everything of the players, then discards them when they are used up, he nevertheless puts up with it for the sake of the thrill he gets on the football field every Sunday and the joy of doing what comes naturally to him.

If you're looking for an uplifting sports film with a rousing last minute win against overwhelming odds, look elsewhere.  This movie is an expose of pro football as big business in which the players are expendable commodities.  There is scarcely any game footage in the film until the very end, and even then it subverts sports movie conventions.  Unfortunately, the love story in the film is unconvincing, even though it is intended to serve as a dramatic foil to the dishonesty and manipulation Elliot faces in his professional life.  It's not surprising that Dayle Haddon didn't go on to much of a film career following this performance.  However, it is surprising that singer Mac Davis didn't make more of a splash on the big screen, since he is so good here.",1226188800,,1239,4.682027649769585
137388,5,0792171306,"This might be considered the perfect teammate for ""The Longest Yard"" but it stands on its' own. A big reason for that is the startling performance of singwriter-singer Mac Davis. He got his character *down* - not too deep of a dude, but deep enough to step to Nolte at the end and say that he knew that his buddy was under surveillance and that suspension was next. He proved to be a buddy on the field but not ""off the field"".
The athletes must work with those who they dislike and distrust. As in any occupation involving more than one individual.
Nolte is no road scholar but is a little older, wiser, roadweary enought to be tired of the detached powers-that-be and their strategy meetings with tired motivational techniques and condescention. Not exactly tired of illegal substances to keep on keel, however. He meets a somewhat enigmatic, free spirit at a typical brawling, baudy pre-big game bash - I'm not clear on how she knew about it or why she would want to attend. She is the absolute perfect balance to all the rough dudes he has to live and perform with and her peaceful demeanor starts to work on him. In the end, shell-shocked over his own decision to chuck-it, he turns to her for...regrouping. Davis will continue playing football - and have no Love in his Life. Nolte will do the converse.
The writing, directing, and cutting here is of a very high order, the attention to detail amazing. I am no fan of this sport but I had no desire to break it up in quarters - the picture flows.
Other performances of note are by Charles Durning, the old-timer trying to keep the young guys focysed and the front office smiling. But he doesn't seem to buy his own exhortations, and he delivers some interesting facial expressions to support that. Dayle Hadden is the understated counterpart to all the riotous action, perhaps a tad too refined and mannered - though that was the '70s. Today she would have been portrayed as the exasperated divorcee who has had it with immature men and masculinity in general.
Some nicely low-lit Love scenes provide peaceful interlude to the mayhem coming in the next frame.",1201996800,2,2115,4.627659574468085

To his credit, Kotcheff isn't heavy-handed in his approach, leavening the film with plenty of wit and warmth. Nolte is superb playing the aching, rebellious Phil, while singer Davis exhibits natural acting chops as Max. Sterling support comes from Steve Forrest and Dabney Coleman (as owners), G.D. Spradlin and Charles Durning (as coaches), and Bo Svenson (hilarious as an unhinged defensive player on the Dallas team).",1183507200,,691,5.528301886792453
137390,5,0792171306,"NORTH DALLAS FORTY is based on the semi-autobiographical book written by Michigan State's own Pete Gent.  Gent played basketball @ MSU and went on to play Tight End for Tom Landry's Cowboys in the 1960s.  The coach of the team in the movie is obviously a caricature of Landry in the way that he calls guys out in film sessions and mixes football with religion, computers, psychology and philosophy (not to mention some mind-games to boot!).

The crux of the film details what it's like to be an aging player in football.  Once players get north of 30 they become much more dependent on shots and pain pills and have to watch their skills erode with each passing season.  The movie depicts the devastating toll that football takes on even the most athletic bodies.

Nick Nolte plays a wide receiver who finds himself in just such a circumstance.  He is fighting for his pro football life while younger players are trying to push him out of the league to make a place for themselves.  He also is in the middle of politics being played out on multiple levels over who gets to play.

While this is a sports movie, we hardly get to see any ""game"" action at all.  This is not a bad thing, just different.  The basis of the movie centers around the ""behind the scenes"" issues of a pro football team.

If you like sports movies (especially football) you'll likely enjoy this one.  Just so you know it's bound to not be as uplifting and cathartic as most sports films tend to be.",1168560000,,1470,4.481203007518797
137391,4,0792171306,"I'm not a particularly big sports fan so I am not qualified to rate the football sequences of this film but by impression is that there is nothing wonderful about them. That's fine because they are beside the point. They are just an incidental part of the story. The real story is of the aging athletes.

Nick Nolte plays the receiver of the Dallas football team. He was great in his day and still has the talent but a life on the field has severely battered his body. He's having a hard time keeping up and, for the first time in his career, he is not a starter. That slot goes to some younger talent. He's at the age where his body and his love interest insist that he should retire. The problem is that he genuinely loves the game.

He has other problems as well. Most of the team are spoiled rotten and act little better than spoiled children. The team owner and the team coach are difficult to work for; they demand sacrifice of their players but are two faced and willing to permanently see them hurt in order to further other goals such as bringing along a newer player. Having your girlfriend catch the eye of the owner's brother is also something that tends to put a damper on either your professional career or your love life.

This was presented as a comedy and there are some light moments where the players are acting badly. They are, after all, getting paid millions to play a game. It is really about the human decisions, though. It is about making tough, personal choices and being willing to live with the consequences. It is about being willing to give up that which is important.",1141257600,2,1598,4.428571428571429

Really enjoy this film (the book was good to). It was nice to find this on DVD. no real extras but it is a really good film with some nice performanaces). It was one of the first US football films I ever saw and it has remained a favourite ever since",1140739200,,254,3.8846153846153846
137393,4,0792171306,"This is an unsparing, unsentimental look at pro football in which the players are alternately brutes, and slaves to management.  Coaches shamelessly manipulate the players and then discard them the moment injury strikes; the players are drugged up in order to coax them onto the field, while at the same time the unpopular players are ensnared by drug charges in order to trap them at contract renegotiation time.

""North Dallas Forty"" is probably one of my favorite sports movies, and definitely my favorite football movie.  That's because of its defiant outsider approach -- ""Ball Four"", the baseball book that made Peter Gent's football novel possible, only ever wound up a lame sitcom; ""North Dallas Forty"" goes all the way.  Even though the movie is based on the Dallas Cowboys of the 1960s, the instantly dated 1970s' filmmaking technique remains timeless (even if it's from the same director who made ""Weekend at Bernie's"", which is timeless for very different reasons).

Part of the movie's continuing appeal remains its cast.  Nick Nolte is a brilliant lead, as the rebellious but honest-to-a-fault North Dallas wide receiver Phil Elliott.  Phil tells it like it is and sees management for what they are, but doesn't realize he's being cheated out of his career until the third or fourth time he's been double-crossed by owners, coaches and friends alike.

Playing a riff on Dandy Don Meredith, country singer/songwriter Mac Davis plays sly quarterback Seth Maxwell.  The rest of the football team is filled out with several ex-NFL players.  John Matuszak's second acting career was launched by this movie, and Bo Svenson's football career should have been launched by this movie.  The coaches, Charles Durning (as a cliche-spouting offensive coordinator) and the great G.D. Spradlin (playing a thinly veiled Tom Landry) both dominate their scenes.  And yes, that's Dabney Coleman as an oil man and part owner who delivers one of the movie's best lines (""Do you speak Canadian?"").

Dayle Haddon looks great as Phil's love interest, but otherwise gets overshadowed by the rest of the cast.  She seems so disinterested in Phil throughout the movie that I was convinced their relationship wouldn't make it another week after the story ended.

Kotcheff directs his football scenes with an interesting approach that could never be duplicated today: there's not a single wide shot of a packed house, not a single closeup of a spectator in North Dallas face paint and a Maxwell jersey.  Gone are the excesses of modern TV football coverage, and the only product endorsement I could spot was for xylocaine.  Most of the early football action is shown in mute flashbacks, and the climactic game against Chicago is not joined until after the two-minute warning.  Even with such minimal football, however, Kotcheff's action is so muddy, bloody and cruel that you can imagine the final game sequence was cued up in L.T.'s VCR the fateful Monday night he tangled with Joe Theismann's leg.

Always worth watching every late January, ""North Dallas Forty"" is one of those films you hope is never going to be remade, because the original has everything you need in a football movie.",1138579200,14,3174,5.057581573896353

137395,5,0792171306,"Fine sleeper film, very much a reflection of iconoclast 1970's. Seldom has corruptive nature of professional sports been on more vivid display than here. Pro football (and others?) comes across as supremely exploitative of players, with millionaire owners collecting the reflected glory. Sure, money is good as is lure of easy women, and adulation is hard to resist, but cost comes high as battered and bruised Nick Nolte finally figures out. Emphasis throughout is on obvious physical toll, but inner toll proves equally devastating. Team quarterback Mac Davis's sly character and coaching staff's slimy ploys illustrate that inner rot in sometimes subtle fashion. Davis's understated performance provides memorable glimpse of intelligent man trapped by own weaknesses. Also one of Nick Nolte's most natural performances in both a brilliant and unorthodox career. His Phil Elliot may not be as clever as Davis, but the love of the game is truer, helping him finally see through the clouds of hype. But where oh where was director Kotcheff when beleagured non-actress Dale Haddon so clearly needed help. Her one and only expression, paralyzed fear, almost brings down the entire film. Was the casting of this ex-Playboy playmate Hugh Hefner's price for  assistance with the production? Thanks Peter Gent for the gutsy expose' and Frank Yablans for bringing it to the screen intact. (After all those Monday evenings on tv, who could ever think of Tom Landry, Don Meredith or straight-laced Roger Staubach the same way again.) (Then too, fans might check out 1949's ""Easy Living"", a less caustic but also revealing film on the earlier days of pro football.) All in all, the screenplay of North Dallas is one of the best from the period -- humorous, savvy, and richly ironic -- the final boardroom scene arguably among the most compelling of any on sports. It's also one of the best arguments for getting athletics out of  all those cathedrals of cult worship and back into neighborhood sandlots where they belong.",1120262400,4,2011,5.128048780487805

This film is ABOUT football... not a football film.  It's about the players in a time when the league was still young and, I dare say, corrupted by the use of pain killers and alochol.  It was the hey dey of the Cowboys, the Raiders and the Steelers and football players were treated like Rock Stars.

It's the film ""Any Given Sunday"" wanted to be.  But failed miserably at even being a cheap imitation.

If you loved 1970's films and 1970's football, this film is a must see.",1106784000,26,814,4.220779220779221
137417,4,0792171306,"Mr Kotcheff, Canadian, is able to cast his objective but sympathetic eye over a range of topics and the humans involved in them,  and provide us with some insights whilst telling a story with panache and a great deal of skill, even if he touches all the typical emotional cues listed in Drama 101.  One of his master works about the darker side of the Australian outback WAKE IN FRIGHT, thought lost for ever, has recently been discovered in a rubbish tip.  His FIRST BLOOD gave a comic book slant to Agent Orange and the pyschosis of a Viet Vet and NORTH DALLAS FORTY reveals professional football as a pretty dispiriting business with the players tools to be used at the pleasure of the businessmen.  If it is the case that the American Empire began its slide as it sank into the Vietnam War, some of the reasons might be found in NORTH DALLAS FORTY which is pretty savage in its depiction of materialism - the tv sinking inthe swimming pool, the hunger guests have for the electronic toys (rubbish) stacked on a table; the black/white divide simmering beneath the relationships between players; the hypocrisy, the myth of competitiveness and its alleged blessings; Business which runs the game just as it runs the war(Haliburton). Nick Nolte is a confused player who loves the game but cannot understand the world. His battered body symbolizes a battered spirit.  The answer is love.  Mr Nolte, as Phil Elliot, grid iron star with magic catching hands, does not take the final  pass in the street from a fellow player. With his collar undone, and the ball at his feet, he's out of the game and back into life.  Personally, I find football, grid iron, (but not soccer)  a stupid and violent game and this is confirmed by the backstage, dressing room, scenes.  Mr Kotcheff tells a great story but.",1099612800,3,1798,4.67936507936508
137418,4,0792171306,"This film made in 1978 is a behind the scenes look at the world of professional football that remains sadly pertinent to the NFL today making the meshing of the business world and athletes a sport of its own.

Nick Nolte plays an aging and aching receiver who has the heart to play the game of football but lacks the ability to have his mind controlled by the people who run the game. Nolte is excellent as he winches and moans throughout the film waiting for his chance to play but being continuously undermined by a corrupt coaching staff and the owners of his team. Mack Davis plays the handsome Texan quarterback who cares little about the mind control and more about having a good time. Charles Durning is the Maalox drinking assistant coach who adds some comedic relief to the story, along with Bo Svenson who plays a psychotic linebacker with nothing but ""kill"" in his heart. Dabney Coleman and Steve Forest are the evil business brothers who treat their players like machines tossing them out whenever necessary without a thought. Finally G.D. Spradlin does an excellent job as the head coach without much of a soul but with plenty of insight.

The story shows a world filled with parties, adultery, corruption and drugs as it engulfs the football players searching to fulfill their dreams of stardom and self-importance. One hit can end it all and one badly placed step can change their world. In order to succeed and have a long career in the game drugs are used to keep the aging body going. While on the outside a toke of marijuana ends the game (shades of Ricky Williams here!). Somehow it just doesn't make any sense. The film is a great classic if you love football but the actual game scenes are high school football at best. And politics......aren't they everywhere? Watch for the stirring speech from an athlete's heart delivered by the late great John Matuszak.",1093478400,5,1880,4.693939393939394
137419,4,0792171306,"Taken from Pete Gent's book about life with the Dallas Cowboys of the Don Meredith era, this movie (a quarter century later) is still the only film that deals with much of the reality of professional football in America. Other movies have been funnier (""The Longest Yard""), others have used more Hollywood fantasy to make their point (""Any Given Sunday""), but none other than George Plimpton's ""Paper Lion"" have any accuracy.

 Not only is ""North Dallas Forty"" accurate, it is accurate in the extreme. It shows players taking shots in their joints in order to play in the game. It shows the way management treats players like meat, like yesterday's newspaper. It shows the way players eschew teamwork to look out for themselves, their statistics and their salaries. In a very Hollywood way, this movie uses big stars but makes a valid point about pro football in a way no film ever has.

 I went to Pete Gent's school, Michigan State University, where I lived in an athletic or ""jock"" dorm. I knew football players at MSU including a couple that went on to become pros and all-pro in the NFL. I'll never forget the day I showed up for my test in freshman Natural Science when I had a little chat with the two football players in my class, one of whom went on to become an all-American and all-pro in the NFL and blocked for O.J. Simpson.

 ""We were at the professor's house last night going over the test,"" one of them told me moments before the test was passed out. That was one of my first real-life lessons in how college athletes are different from the rest of us. When the ""North Dallas Forty"" version of college football is made, maybe that scene will be included.

 Until then, you have this film to help you understand how the NFL really works and what it's employees go through during their careers, which average 4.3 years.",1090972800,11,1833,4.584097859327217
137420,5,0792171306,"NORTH DALLAS FORTY is not just a sports film, it's an indictment of corporate America that was the forerunner of the ""Greed is good"" films of the 1980's.  One of the nicest acting surprises of 1979 was Mac Davis as Seth Maxwell, the consumate huckster who fails in his quest to save his friend, Phil Elliott from his own pre determined gridiron destiny.  As Elliott, Nick Nolte, gives 1 of his 3 best performances and he and Davis play perfectly off each other.  This film is a winner.  All that was missing was NFL Films ""Voice of God"" John Facenda, with the play by play.",1072137600,5,573,4.428571428571429
137421,4,0792171306,"An NFL wide receiver (Nolte) who purportedly has ""the best hands in football"" has been benched and is being used as a substitute.  It's not for lack of ability or effort but because of his ""attitude"".  He's been a starter for years and it's hard to take (""I'll die on the bench"").  He needs to ""give 'em what they want"" and ""you had better learn to play the game, and I don't just mean the game of football"".  Advice from his buddy Seth Maxwell (Mac Davis), who's the team's quarterback and a ""star"", is good advice, but Elliot (Nolte)doesn't seem to have it in him to follow it.  Catching a winning TD pass from Maxwell in the closing seconds isn't enough.  The play was a ""fluke"", as summed up by their head coach B.A. (G.D. Spradlin) while analyzing the game film the following week.  The week after the game is what the show is about.  The meetings, practices, workouts and various extra curricular activities, all leading up to the next game in Chicago.  Charles Durning plays an assistant coach who is a constant bother to the players while he drinks bottles of Maalox.  Bo Svenson (Joe Bob) and John Matuszak (O.W.) play excellent supporting roles along with many other actors.  If you grew up thinking professional athletes were the salt of the earth this show may very well make you reconsider.",1054771200,7,1303,4.597402597402597
137422,5,0792171306,"Nick Nolte does a supurb job as a veteran wide receiver playing for a top team in the NFL during the late 60's or early 70's.  The fact that he is an individual in a team sport makes this story even more exciting.  Although he has come to the time in his career when medical science and tons of pain killers are a necessary daily diet in order to lace up the old cleets one more time for the team, he does not shirk his responsibilities or take the easy road when it comes to performing his job.  Mack Davis turns in a creditable acting job as Seth the veteran QB of the team that has his way even when he is wrong.  Now if you think that this movie is all about football you will miss the true meaning and emotion of the entire event.  In the midst of a savage and hostile working environment a person can still be true to self amidst the greedy management side of a very tough sport.  I hope that this whets your appetite to get this movie.  There are memorable moments in and out of the locker room.  The tell all book written by Peter Gent was more than an eye opener back a few decades ago and this rendition of the book does it justice in every way.  Once you start watching this movie you will not want to turn it off!  If you are a fan of football reality, you will want this movie.  Oh, by the way, the author Peter Gent played professional football for the Dallas Cowboys back in the 60's I believe.  That is what makes this movie so creditable and Peter does not hold back anything.  Enjoy!!  By the way I think that this movie is rated ""R"" for brief nudity, language, and violence.",1054252800,7,1593,4.12987012987013
137423,5,0792171306,"If you like pro football, you'll love this film. Especially, if you remember the old Dallas Cowboys.  The movie's ""fictional"" team, the Bulls, are suppose to be the the Dallas Cowboys.  The coach is suppose to be Landry, the quarterback (Mac Davis) is suppose to be Don Meredith, etc.  Of course, any resemblance is ""purely coincidental"".  Yeah, right.
The point of the movie is how the players are manipulated/motivated to win.  Receiver Elliot, played by Nick Nolte, is a veteran nearing the twilight of his career.  He loves the game, but also sees the human toll. Mac Davis understands and doesn't care. He realizes that it's just a job.
I asked a co-worker who used to play for Green Bay about that time, if the movie was accurate.  He said it was mild compared to the real thing.  This is what football was like when roughing the quarterback wasn't illegal, it was expected.  Everyone always knew football was business and not just a game, but someone forgot to tell the players.  When they realize it, it's too late. See this movie.  You won't be disappointed!",1041897600,7,1067,4.713513513513513
137424,4,0792171306,"Very effective film of the sports world.  Nolte is terrific, even if the romance is a little cliche and unbelievable.  Very talky, and not much action on the field, but gives an excellent counterbalance to the usual ""feel good"" sports films I've grown tired of.
DvD picture is superb.  Audio starts a bit shaky (with music and background noise overpowering dialouge) but eventually evens out.",1008720000,3,392,5.0
137425,4,0792171306,"This movie really blew the lid off a lot of the shenanigans that go on in professional sports.  I'm sure that many were upset with the portrayal of athletes as drunken, pill popping idiots but that was probably a reality back then.  This movie precedes Any Given Sunday by two decades and still hits harder in its revelation of football's seamy side.  Nick Nolte is superb as Phil Elliott.  Mac Davis also gives a fine performance.  The scenes of athletes being shot up with painkillers to play is intense.  The laissez faire attitude of coaches and team owners is probably more realistic than the NFL would care to admit.  I love the scene when Nolte gets suspended for smoking marijuana and his response is that the team is injecting harder drugs into him each Sunday just so he can play.  That kind of mirrors the insanity and stupidity of the NFL drug testing policies even today.  Football is an American institution but indeed there is a dark side.  This movie does a fine job of pointing that out.",970617600,27,1004,4.589887640449438
