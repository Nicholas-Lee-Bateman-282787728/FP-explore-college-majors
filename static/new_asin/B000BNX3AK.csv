2430588,5,B000BNX3AK,I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas although she didn't wait that long...she watched it in the middle of July and loved it.,1279584000,,136,4.708333333333333
2430589,5,B000BNX3AK,"any movie that do not put me to sleep in the first 15 min.is a good movie,it help mt attention all the way through the movie from beginning to the end,great movie.",1222214400,,163,4.125
2430590,1,B000BNX3AK,This was too long and I think could have and should have been shortened. It was not one of disney's  better animated movies I've seen. For example the journey to find the new king jesus is entirely too long .Cut that long jouney out and give us a break. Don't buy it,1206316800,,266,4.115384615384615
2430591,1,B000BNX3AK,"How bad can an animated movie be? Let me count the ways. First of all, the best art work in the movie is on the cover of the box. It's all downhill inside. Secondly, the story is a hash of magicians, wolves, dragon, scorpion, slaves, etc., and 'let's all be friends and play nice' morality. Whoever produced, directed, and wrote this mess needs to 'examine their priorities', as Ron Weasley would tell them. Baby Jesus turns out to be a bright light, the angel is a poor rip-off of the genie from Aladdin, David's slingshot kills the dragon (oops! spoiler! but you aren't really going to watch this, are you?) and Herod (who probably was a monster in his own right with no help from sorcery whatsoever)is a spoiled brat. Do not e-mail me for a free copy. For the first time I have thrown away a movie that I paid full price for. I think it might actually be bad for children to watch so I won't pass it on.",1196121600,13,906,4.304093567251462
2430592,3,B000BNX3AK,I had hoped for a better story but this fel short of the reviews I had read.  I was pleased with the service but disappointed in the product.,1169078400,,141,4.035714285714286
2430593,1,B000BNX3AK,"Make no mistake; this movie is not biblical or even about Jesus.

In this make believe world there is dark and light magic.  The magi explain how light magic fights against dark magic and how they have been chosen to find the magical gifts for God.  The wise men go on an enchanted journey to find the secret City of Salt where the treasures have been hidden.  All the while Herod and his evil sorcerer (who turns into different creatures) try to stop the great wise men heroes.  Once the wise men find the City of Salt and answer a couple riddles using their virtues of Courage, Humility, and Love they are given gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  After defeating Herod and the sorcerer, who turns into a dragon, they briefly mention that they take the gifts to Jesus, but never show the manger scene or anything of the nature.

This story is being told to a young boy by a shopkeeper / bartender and finishes the story by telling him that if you believe in the 3 wise men, they will bring your presents on the day of the 3 Wise Men.

If you would like a free copy of this movie, email me. I will give you mine unless I have already destroyed it.  This story is blasphemous on so many levels, not just because they changed the story, but because they substituted anti-Christian values into positive roles.  No self-respecting Christian story includes using magic to fight evil or changes the meaning of the birth of Jesus.  I just cannot figure out how a Christian singer such as Jaci Velasquez would be a voice of one of the characters.

This movie is a cross between Aladdin, Harry Potter, and Jason and the Argonauts.",1166918400,44,1618,4.465986394557823
2430594,5,B000BNX3AK,I love it!!!!,1441324800,,13,3.6666666666666665
2430595,5,B000BNX3AK,Love this movie,1424390400,,15,4.333333333333333
2430596,1,B000BNX3AK,The kids didn't enjoy it.,1421712000,,25,4.2
2430597,1,B000BNX3AK,I wish I had read the reviews before wasting my money.  At this time this is all I can say.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS if you want the real biblical story.,1391644800,4,150,3.806451612903226
2430598,1,B000BNX3AK,Was hoping this video would discuss the birth of our Lord and how it related to the the three wise men. Turned out to be a disney junk film.  don't buy it. save your money and tell your kids the story with a free book from the library. they'll enjoy it more.,1362096000,,258,3.9615384615384617
2430599,3,B000BNX3AK,"If you have young kids, I would not recommend this movie.
Otherwise, it is another approach to the wise men story, that might lead to read the Bible with your kids. Which is a good thing then!",1349740800,2,192,4.216216216216216
2430600,4,B000BNX3AK,Este DVD de los tres reyes magos me encanta. La voz de Jose Luis Rodriguez es inconparable y muy divertido. Me encanta.,1324944000,,119,4.454545454545454
2430601,1,B000BNX3AK,This dvd does not have anyting to do with the story of the Three Kings. I bought for my daughter so she can keep her traditions and it was a total fiasco. It is an adventure kind of film and even some of the scenes are not even appropiated for kids under 7. If you are looking for the real Three Kings story this definitely not it,1295049600,4,330,3.9402985074626864
2430602,2,B000BNX3AK,"Let me tell you what I liked about this movie first of all:  1st,  it has a bilingual soundtrack and options for subtitles in English if you choose the Spanish language track.  2nd, it has some good voice actors and animation  better than many cartoons I have seen. 3rd, it is about the only kid's movie to address the Jan. 5th holiday I know of, which really is a BIG deal in other parts of the world, and in more places in the USA than you might imagine!  I think it's a wonderful tradition and should be encouraged.  The downside? 1st, this movie  certainly doesn't maintain the Biblical story,(who knew the Wise Men got so much help from a hunky soldier and warrior babe?) 2nd, another viewer was correct; Jesus is often lost in the action of the story; most of the plot has to do with getting magical gifts to take to Jesus.  3rd,  and most importantly,  it substitutes magic and monsters for the very real dangers the Magi probably had to overcome; it's a shame the makers of this film didn't trust the power of the story they had all along. My recommendation?  Watch it with your kids and discuss it with them, both for it's fun points and to make sure they understand the story it is based on (not just the dragon and evil wizard).",1294185600,4,1239,4.366812227074236
2430603,1,B000BNX3AK,"This movie is very dark.  Please note that it is ""not rated.""  It is NOT even close to a ""G"" movie, and it is closer to a ""PG13"" with all of the dark magic and imagery.  It has nothing to do with the true story of the Wise Men.",1293062400,2,227,3.5918367346938775

8089573,1,B000BNX3AK,Arrived quickly and in good condition. Aside from that a waste of money!  I was looking for the real story of the magi to show in Spanish class. This was a toal waste of time and money. Shame on me I should have read the reviews first!,1510963200,,235,4.0

8089579,4,B000BNX3AK,"I saw this film with my 5 years old daughter and she was disappointed that baby Jesus was not at the end of the story, but she liked it nevertheless.  When I asked her what she liked the most about it, she said, The gift at the end.  They gave him a friend.  She was referring when the modern urban kid gets his present and like the original gifts of the wise men, it was more about love and friendship than commercial value.  This is more like a road trip story in which the 3 Wise Men became wiser by their friendship.

Now, the film is not perfect, but it is not bad either and you can use it with your children as an introduction for some themes.

The movie begins with a sad and bitter child that did not get anything for Christmas and steals a star from a public Christmas tree and hides in cafeteria that was about to close.  The clerk who seems to know him tells him that he must return the star and that he still can get a present because it is January the 5th and Christmas is not over yet and asks him if he wants to hear the story.  The boy says that he would if it has action and beautiful girls.

That is the key.  This version of the Wise Men is targeted to this kids generation that expects something similar to a movie based on Harry Potter and Star Wars.  So this version is not from the Bible, it was something made up by the clerk (who is the voice of the writer) to keep the childs attention.

Now the handsome warrior named Tobias and the sexy rebel named Sarah are versions of Tobias and Sarah from the book of Tobit (or Tobias) who fought together against a demon.  Parents could use the fictional characters as reference for talking about the Biblical ones.

About light versus darkness, it is not that wrong either.

Before Jesus, there was no Christianity and the Wise Men were not from Israel, so they were not Jewish.  Then, who were they?  We could guess they were very educated people, they studied the stars and they were very open minded to believe the existence of a pure light that represents all the good things in the universe and inside peoples heart.

I told to my daughter, the Wise Men were followers of the light and when they met Jesus, they realized he was the true light of love.

The message of Jesus is for everybody, and that is what the Wise Men represent, that Jesus welcomes any person from any culture or race.

Another reason I like this film is because it is not about Santa.  Do not get me wrong, I am not a Santas hater, but in any version of a story of the Wise Men, books or movie, Jesus is mentioned or appeared in a way or the other, something that you do not see in a film about Santa when Christmas would disappear if Santa does not deliver the gifts on time.",1452124800,2,2721,4.194230769230769
