8484213,5,B005REJNBG,"John Montgomery is one of the least known but most significant aviation pioneers.  Credited as the first person to create a craft capable of carrying a human in controlled flight, John Montgomery built and flew a series of gliders twenty years before the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk.  This movie is a dramatization of Montgomery's life and highlights several of his innovations. Most of us remember Glen Ford playing forty or fifty year old characters.  It's amazing to see him here in his mid twenties.  Great Film; fascinating story, good acting and a classic movie.",1417478400,2,575,4.958333333333333
8484214,5,B005REJNBG,"Right up there with ""Edison the Man"" and ""Alexander Graham Bell"", this movie displays the courage of a young inventor during all those eary and trying days of developement.  Also, like ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" and ""Marie Curie"", there are well-played scenes of later years in Montgomery's life.
  Hard to find, but well worth the catch!  Emotional and adventurous, ""Gallant Journey"" should be added to the middle-school curriculum nation-wide",1398124800,2,446,5.328571428571428
8484215,5,B005REJNBG,"I can't believe I lived an entire lifetime only hearing of the Wright Brothers contribution to flight.  This movie opened my eyes.  I'm sick there are no copies to buy.  It is a really fine example of what the film industry captured, so many years ago.",1367193600,4,252,4.434782608695652
