4993465,4,B006JN87W0,"The SyFy Channel has been doing ""reimaginings"" of classic public-domain books for the past few years, such as ""Tin Man"" or ""Alice."" But ""Neverland"" is a little different. Rather than reimagining the tale of Peter Pan, this miniseries presents the story of how a street urchin became the flying boy who never grows up, and the beginning of his war with Captain Hook.

In 1906, the fallen arisocrat James ""Jimmy"" Hook (Rhys Ifans) has collected a gang of young boys who steal things for him, lead by the impish Peter Pan (Charlie Rowe). But when Jimmy and the gang vanish, Peter must use a mysterious black orb to travel into a wholly alien world -- Neverland. In this world, there are silver faeries, a pirate ship, and a lost tribe of Indians.

The pirate captain Elizabeth Bonny (Anna Friel) quickly fascinates Jimmy, especially when she reveals that the fairies have magical dust that allows flight. Peter is horrified by his father figure's betrayal, especially when the pirates kill one of the boys. His only goal is to get back to London, and the only way he knows how is to seek out a hooded man who appears in his dreams with the black orb.

With the help of Aaya (aka Tiger Lily) (Q'orianka Kilcher), Peter ventures into a strange lost city, where he discovers the truth about Neverland. But when the pirates attack and capture the boys and Aaya, Peter must use his newfound powers to save them and defeat Captain Hook...

J.M. Barrie didn't really go into the background of Peter Pan in his original novel -- Peter Pan just sort of EXISTED, like a nature sprite or some forgotten deity. But ""Neverland"" does do a decent job trying to spin up a backstory for Peter and Captain Hook -- it tries to explain the battle between Hook and Peter, what Neverland is, and how pirates and Indians got to it.

And there is a really whimsical, fantastical air to the story -- silver faeries, fallen comets, eight-legged crocodiles, an orb, and a vast city made of woven trees.. The giant white CGI trees are kind of goofy, though.

But the movie also uses its length to establish the bond between Peter and Hook, which is a genuine connection of father/son love and trust that is corrupted by greed and cruelty. Rowe reminds me of a younger, more expressive Daniel Radcliffe, and Ifans is absolutely brilliant as a complex man who is both cruel and kind, compassionate and utterly ruthless.

And it has a solid cast, with Anna Friel as a cold-heart swashbuckler, Bob Hoskins as Smee, and a bunch of pretty talented kids as the Lost Boys. The one problem is Kilcher, who is so wooden you could saw her into logs, but she's balanced out by a more realistic, well-rounded depiction of the Indians (""Dinner."" ""You're going to eat us?"" ""Why, do you taste good?"") as shown by Raoul Trujillo and George Aguilar.

""Neverland"" is a pretty decent what-if tale about the origins of Peter Pan, which does a fairly good job at explaining Neverland without robbing it of magic. Not the best classic-based miniseries, but a good one.",1332547200,24,3014,4.652255639097745
4993466,4,B006JN87W0,While this is not quite has good as hook it is an intresting new take on peter pan i will recommend this movie to anyone who likes good stories and for people who liked pirates of the caribbian. This is the second time that hollywood has done something new with peter pan hook was the first one to do something new with peter pan and now this is the second. Just to let everyone know peter does fly in this movie.,1332374400,3,413,4.111111111111111
4993467,5,B006JN87W0,"I absolutely loved this mini-series!  I wish I had old-school-recorded it on VHS from the TV because I just want to watch it over and over.  I'm a big fan of all the Peter Pan stories and interpretations out there (Hook being one of my main favourites).  This mini-series just tied everything together.  Now with this prequel to Peter Pan, all the classic story movie interpretations, and Hook as a sequel, I will be forever entertained with the neverending stories from Neverland.",1327795200,4,481,4.829268292682927
4993468,5,B006JN87W0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this ""prequel"" to Peter Pan. I also enjoyed ""Tin Man."" ""Alice"" didn't excite me as much! I think my FAVE was ""The Lost Room."" Whether it's Sci-Fi or SyFy, I think they come out with some good, imaginative mini-series. Some are better than others but, isn't that true in most any case.....music, movies, etc.? Anyways, the point is.....I enjoyed this one very much!",1325721600,2,385,4.848484848484849
4993469,5,B006JN87W0,"I was excited to see the new mini-series, Neverland.  It was a wonderful movie and I thought the actors were wonderful!!  I agree with one of the posters, that the flying could have been done a bit better, but when you think about it, he was just learning to fly and I believe anyone would be awkward.  I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD, so I can own it and watch it again and again!!  Well, done!",1324857600,6,403,4.063291139240507
4993470,5,B006JN87W0,First I want to say I loved Neverland...  Not too sure what the other reviewer was talking about like this could ever compared to the other miniseries like Battlestar and Farscape.  For one its not supposed too be anything like them.  Your supposed to use your imagination and relive it thru a kids eye.  If you haven't seen it you really need to makes me wish I was a kid again believeing I could fly,1323993600,6,401,4.306666666666667

It covers all the details, even elaborating on where Neverland is!  It originally aired on SyFy as a mini-series; I remember watching it and loving it!
Although the graphics aren't the greatest, being that it likely had a budget, overall I really loved the story and the approach to the origins of Peter.
Totally recommend watching it.",1513814400,9,488,4.809523809523809

4993552,3,B006JN87W0,"Main actor hams up story to extent you'll probably be bored with him  before too far into movie. Seems repetitious in places - probably could have shaved off about hour from movie and you wouldn't miss a thing. There are several other movies along similar story line that pull of capers in smoother style. ""Cutthroat Island""  would be classic comparison movie. This ones okay - but be prepared to be a little bored as the plot thickens.
Some people might go for 4***  others maybe a 2**. I think a 3***  is about right in middle being fair to over all quality of the special effects included in the flick. It's not at a full 'R'  rating status but most parents may find some of content not suitable depending on quality of training they wish to provide for their children. It's not a ""Bad"" movie it just doesn't have all that much to keep you from saying I've seen better before.",1497744000,,879,4.434782608695652

It does add a scientific explanation for how the characters get to neverlabd that's believable and adds to the story, the myth, the legend that is peternal pan. This story is more of an origin story of how Peter Pan and captain hook came to be that fits in with the other Peter Pan stories out there.

4993617,4,B006JN87W0,"The strengths of this miniseries were the acting and the script. It was a very well put together story, and the actors really took that script to make the story something very good, unique and yet still true to the story of Peter Pan. They took J Barry's masterpiece, and added depth, meat, and for a story to do that means that it has to make sense. It totally does. This story sets out with the endeavor to fill in all the missing wholes in the story, and they very much so accomplished that goal.

The only thing that I saw was lacking was the production. It was low budget. The special effects were decent, and if I was watching this 10 years ago it would be much worse a quality. But I don't think the lack of production took too much away from the story telling. This story should have gone to a bigger screen with a bigger production budget. It was a great script, the actors executed it well, and it should be seen by more people besides those who have the Sci-Fi channel. It limits too much even who would hear about it.",1441152000,,1029,4.25

4993621,3,B006JN87W0,"""Journey Back to Where It All Began""
This is the tagline for the 2011 two-part TV series, ""Neverland"". The two parts total 169 minutes. This is a prequel to the classic Peter Pan story,  imaginatively showing us how Peter and the Lost Boys got to Neverland. How Hook and the pirates and an Indian tribe got there. Why they never age. How Hook lost his hand (hint, it was not by croc). How Peter can fly. And how Peter can move back and forth between our world and Neverland.

""Neverland"" is meant to give us a realistic version of the story (albeit one with sci-fi elements). I watched Part 1 with family members and could not get anyone to continue onto Part 2 with me. The pace is stultifying. Rhys Ifans, as Jimmy Hook, too often speaks in a monotone that puts you to sleep. Or wonder if he was asleep. Bob Hoskins reprises his role as the pirate Smee (the 1st time was in Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"", 1991), but this time he's tired.

There are some good things about ""Neverland"". Charlie Rowe, who plays Peter, is fresh and energetic. The scenery in some parts of Neverland is exceptional. The twisted trees of the iceland are amazing - made me want to go there. But it wasn't enough to pull the series out of the morass of its plodding plot.

The DVD/BluRay sets are 1-disc each. The show is presented in widescreen and English subtitles are available. Both DVD and BluRay  include 6 Special Features. The commentary track, I thought, improves on the TV series.
1. Commentary by Nick Willing (writer/director). This is a solid commentary track. Willing talks a lot about the decisions he had to make while filming, and what effects he was going for. He tends to speak in a monotone and there are parts where he is silent for a bit. If he had been joined by a 2nd person for the commentary, it may have been more lively. Still, I enjoyed the additional information Willing tells.
For example, except for the Captain's cabin (which is a set), the scenes on the pirate ship were shot on a real deck. The cast and crew traveled to Genoa, Italy, where ""The Neptune"" is in permanent dock, now a tourist attraction. The Neptune was built by Roman Polanski for his 1986 film, ""Pirates"". It cost $9,000,000 to build at the time and looks authentic, though it has steel plating below the waterline.
Willing thought of ""Neverland"" as a movie, not a TV show. But ""one of the unfortunate aspects of making one of these grand television epics is that we have very little time, when we're filming, to explore and experiment. I have to shoot 5 to 6 minutes of screen time a day. In a regular feature film, a director might get 30 seconds or less to shoot in a day.""
2. ""The Story Behind the Story: Cast Interviews"" (16 minutes) Rhys Ifans (plays Jimmy Hook), Anna Friel (plays Elizabeth Bonny), Charlie Rowe and Bob Hoskins talk about making the series. Ifans says with a grin, ""I never grew up having 'Peter Pan' read to me. I'm a Welshman. We've got far better stories to tell.""
3. ""Green Screen to Scene"" (4 minutes) Most locations in the movie were shot with green screen. For four locations, you are shown the rehearsal/shooting of a scene in front of the green screen, side by side with the finished movie after digital effects were added. This gives you a good idea of how hard the actors had to act to pretend they were on a cliff edge, for example. The scenes shown are:
....The Alchemist's Orb
....Discovering Dr. Fludd (his name is also spelled Flood elsewhere in Special Features)
....Chases by Pirates
....Battle on Bull Island
4. ""Journey Into Neverland: Art Gallery"" Click through 85 illustrations:
....48 storyboards
....23 digital backgrounds
....2 Tinkerbell concepts
....4 character costume designs
....8 concepts for the 10-legged crocs
5. ""Neverland: Access All Areas"" (23 minutes) This looks like it was a promotional TV Special. Follow the actors and crew as they shoot ""Neverland"". Commentators include Nick Willing, Charlie Rowe, Lee Wilson (special effects supervisor), Ann Friel, Charles Dance (plays Fludd), Raoul Trujillo (plays Holy Man), Q'Orianka Kilcher (plays Aaya, Holy Man's daughter, replacing Tiger Lily in the original story), Lorn MacDonald (plays Fox, one of the Lost Boys), Rhys Ifan and Cas Anvar (plays Starkey, a pirate).
Rowe relates that flying in a harness was pretty painful.

The acting is great, especially Charlie Rowe as the boy who never grows up ad scenery is breathtaking. Really, the only downside is the ending; once the adventures end, we end up at the beginning or the original tale with Peter missing his shadow and no sequel on site. Yes, we all know how the story goes but it would've been nice to see it with this cast after seeing how well they were all cast.

4993725,5,B006JN87W0,"I love fairy tales that are realistic and dark, yet have happy endings.  This one is one of the best that I have ever seen.  The cast is
superb, sets very atmospheric  with lots of nasties including piratess Bonnie, based on a real woman pirate.  I liked the twist
with the globe device that allowed people to move from present day to Neverland.  In the book, Neverland is located in the Atlantic
Ocean but this makes it more spooky and surreal.  I understand the people who made this movie also made ALICE and TIN MAN.
They like high cliffs, towering trees and other vertically challenged heights; I particularly liked the Tree City.  London is well done
visually and must have not been a pleasant place for poor kids to live.  When I was in London in the late 1970s I made it a point
to visit the famous Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens.  I have an original (or nearly original) book PETER AND WENDY that
my Mom used to read to me when I was little.  Its falling apart but I treasure it and keep it in my rather extensive private library.
  James Hook is marvelously played as the villainous caretaker who will eventually become Captain Hook.  While most pre-sequals
suffer a bit from fore-knowledge by the viewers of what is going to happen later, this film really shines, in my opinion, as having
enough new imaginative stories to make it really worth while owning and watching.  May the Lost boys live forever.

This isn't the most well made, well thought out movie/ mini series. Some of the stuff made me squinch, others bored me.
However, it does explain how things came to be in Neverland. (I have found other theories better, but hey, it's an interesting concept)
But my favorite part was the ending because it just made me very excited and pulled everything together.

Bottomline:  I wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for it. I haven't watching it since. But I do remember the ending.

4993729,4,B006JN87W0,"Neverland makes a good effort in telling a story of what happen before the Barrie Story.  But the problem is that the story seems to be made up as they went along.  There is no forethought really in matching it to Barrie's story. It would have gone along well with the Peter Pan(2003) film if not for a big problem with the story in that there is no difference in time when Neverland occurs 1906 and when Wendy shows up.  Barrie in fact wrote about Wendy and Peter in 1904.  This is a major problem if this is to be a prequel.  Even if you go by when the novel was written there is only a 5 year difference.  For this story to work generations would have to go by in order for the myths of Peter to develop, that Wendy would known of.",1376265600,,734,4.0625

4993753,3,B006JN87W0,"Mr. Ifans' performance in ""Neverland"" is about as subtle as a flying cow flop, which is the main problem with an otherwise rather interesting movie. ""Neverland"" attempts to lay the groundwork for the better-known stories of the escapades of Peter Pan, and it works effectively on this level.  But if we're supposed to view Hook as a fairly decent chap who in the course of this movie becomes a monster, forget it.  He's a jerk from the moment he steps onto the screen, unredeemable even though a case is presented for the torments of his life that took him to the ""Fagan-like"" role he's living when we meet him.

The beloved Disney version of the Peter Pan story is no more accurate to the original text than ""Neverland"", but since there was genuine potential here to illuminate the backstory, it's a shame this movie doesn't really deliver.  It's an attractive production, with predictably good performances, especially by the children; but by the halfway point, I was getting bored.

Hook's the key character in this movie; I wish he'd been better drawn and that Mr. Ifans had delivered one of his more multi-dimensional typical performances.  Do we love him or hate him?  Do we care?  Booyah.",1354147200,4,1195,4.795121951219512

4993757,5,B006JN87W0,"Disney was the first major institution to popularize fairy tales and children literature in the visual medium.  Disney's classic movies like Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty established the fairy tale genre as a cash cow if done properly.  Then in the 1980's came Hallmark, which in turn made miniseries based on famous fairy tales and children's literature.  Hallmark's miniseries were often the best on television with highlights such as Merlin, Arabian Nights and Gulliver's Travels.  But with the spread of satellite television, the standard of quality has passed to the SyFy channel, formerly SciFi.  Starting with Tin Man, which put Zooey Deschanel on the Hollywood map, then followed by Alice, we now have Neverland.  I have seen over a dozen incarnations of the Peter Pan story, and admit that this is probably the best one yet.  Going further back in character development than previous Peter Pan movies, Syfy has created a series built on interwoven plot lines, multiple main characters, and probably the most believable origin story of Hook I have encountered.  Overall, quite entertaining to watch.",1350172800,,1120,5.252808988764045
4993758,4,B006JN87W0,"Its an after the fact prequel Syfy put out about what made Peter Pan become to boy we know him as(keep in mind this is not written by JM Barrey.  Its a version where Peter and James Hook were friends and partners in crime (literally). James wanted an orb but Peter didn't know why. Peter broke into a building so that James could find what he was looking for and it turns out (I'm not telling you much) that it is a transmitter to Neverland. A place on the other side of the solar system where there are fairies and pirates and indians have come from earth.  In Neverland they don't age. Tiger Lily is apparently over 100 years old.  Its how Hook and Pan went from being friends to the rivals we all know them as.
Its not written by JM Barrie but inspired by his story like so many others.
Everytime I see the guy who plays Hook I think about the character he played in Notting Hill and him standing at the door with his underwear wedged up his butt but other than that lol its a really good story.",1346025600,,998,4.160621761658031
4993759,5,B006JN87W0,"I don't typically like when a prequal is made to a classic, well-known story. They usually distort the original charm, adding too many unrealistic and damaging side stories. But surprisingly, I did not feel this way after watching Neverland. The license taken did not seem to distort the orignal story overly much. Of course though, in typical fashion, they followed the modern formula: a mysterious magic object that everyone wants to pocess, mutant giant animals, ""politically-correct"" female leads, a sensuous story-line between characters, and of course, the dependably-always-there ""believe in yourself"" moment. Overall though, made exceptionally well (although the use of green screen was in a few scenes painfully obvious - but when 98% of a movie involves green screen, some slack can be given) and a truly engaging story. The characters were all casted magnificently.

There is some story-line errors. It doesn't make sense that a ""magic orb"" is what transports people to and from Neverland, yet in the book, Peter, Wendy, John, & Michael can fly to the ""Second star to the right, straight on til morning."" Especially as the magic orb is destroyed. How does Peter then get back to earth in order to hear Wendy's stories at the nursery window? It is also mentioned at the very end how Peter has lost his shadow - by that story time-line, Wendy and the boys should come immediately at the end of this movie. But according to the book, Peter and the Lost Boys had already had many different adventures on Neverland, had been there for awhile, and Peter had been sneaking to hear bedtime stories from Wendy for some time. Not a big issue, but still a discrepency, nonetheless.

A few content advisories though:

Hook and the female pirate captain are obviously sleeping together. She gives him a major come-on by strandling his lap, following by a passionate kiss. They are seen in her cabin in positions very indicatory of having sex together; she is seen naked from the back, waist up. She wears very low cut blouses throughout the entire movie, and all of her legs are seen as she reclines in a very seductive position on her bed. She is also seen beginning to disrobe, and alot of leg is seen as she steps into a pool of water. There is alot of sexual implications when they talk to each other.

Of course, there is fighting, but there's not too much blood shown really or even the actual inflicting of the wounds received. You see Hook lose his hand. There is some language but if I recall correctly, not overly much.

There are giant multi-legged crocodiles that wait bellow the ship for any unlucky plank-walkers; one pirate is thrown down to them, you see the waters swirl and the beasts fighting, but the body isn't seen. (Strangly though, when the Lost Boys end up in the exact same watery locations later, there are no crocodiles...convenient! Hmmmm.) The crodiles would be very scary for young children.

I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was very well-done, and even as an adult, enjoyed the several hour mini-series very much.",1345507200,4,3053,4.827915869980879

4993768,4,B006JN87W0,"""Neverland"" is a surprisingly charming story which speculates the origins of ""Peter Pan"".  SyFy is hardly known for quality original filmsn as most feature nuclear induced mutants, which makes ""Neverland"" all the more surprising. It speculates Peter as a kind of Oliver Twist and his lost boys as a gang of pick-pockets and thieves in 19th century London led by their Fagin-esque pimp Jimmy(Rhys Ifans) to assist in his re-insertion into London's high society. Charlie Rowe (The Golden Compass) agrees to a big score which involves stealing a crystal orb, which eventually teleports all to the Neverland where the story truly takes shape.  ""Neverland"" is done with surprising pannache, aided by a superb cast...Ifans is perfectly menacing as Hook.  Rowe is charming as Peter, and the film even features Keira Knightley as the voice of Tinkerbell.  The special effects are dazzling, even though not photo-realistic, and they add to the magic.

4993852,3,B006JN87W0,"Have you ever wondered how the pirates came to be in Neverland? Or where Peter first came from? Or the origins of the lost boys? Until now, we were forced to use our imagination to explain these mysteries.

There are worse places to be in London than on the streets in a gang of urchins, and Peter (Charlie Rowe) enjoys playing the leader of a ragtag bunch of pickpockets and petty thieves. Working from the rooftops directing his boys with the use of a flute and reporting to their protector, Jimmy (Rhys Ifans), at night, he has a pretty decent life. There's just one hitch in it -- he wants to be taken seriously. Jimmy has been hired to pull of a major job in a jewelry store and at the last minute decides not to use the boys, but Peter isn't about to let that stop him. He breaks in and discovers more than he bargained for, since the man who hired Jimmy isn't after your usual market-fare wares; he wants an orb responsible for transporting a pirate ship into another world. None of them are aware of the danger and when Jimmy taps the orb, fascinated with the shimmering world in its depths, he and the rest of Peter's friends wind up in Neverland.

Once there, the boys land aboard the pirate ship and the younger children are turned over to Smee (Bob Hoskins) to clean the decks, while the infamous pirate vixen Elizabeth (Anna Friel) takes a shine to Jimmy -- so much so that she shares a few secrets with him, including her desire to bottle fairy dust and figure out how to use it. Meanwhile, back in London Peter finagles the secret of the orb out of the man who was going to buy it (Charles Dance) but his trip into Neverland throws him into the midst of an Indian tribe. What follows are the origins of the classic story as we discover how each character came to Neverland, how Peter befriends Tinkerbell (voiced by Keira Knightley), when and where he and Captain Hook became enemies, and so forth. The result is a lavish four hour miniseries that fares about as well as most things from the SyFy channel -- wonderful ideas with an execution that sometimes isn't quite up to par, but you have to give them credit for sheer imagination.

The cleverness involved here is what works best, winding in elements of Dickens and other classic writers in our initial introduction to familiar figures and then throwing them into the midst of a wondrous place of undiscovered secrets. The history between Captain Hook and Peter is a touching one and the characterization is strong, but it was really the first half that won me over -- traversing the streets of London in a perfect throwback to Oliver Twist, we get to enjoy a bit of a period drama and good old fashioned thieving and sword fighting before we get into the nuances of piracy and the fairy realm. Of course, the acting ranges from wonderful to stilted and awkward; it helps that they have such a solid British adult cast and the boys are not bad, but from time to time everyone delivers a particularly excruciating line, the Indian princess more often than the rest. I loved the costuming and detail of the ship and for the most part the script carries along at a decent pace without too much lagging. It does become a tad absurd in its last twenty minutes, and some have complained about the abrupt, cheeky ending, but I quite liked it.

While there were moments when the bad special effects made me wince, I thought it was a unique and clever twist on a very old story. The characters are marvelous even if they are a tad bit predictable, and it does a good job of explaining some of the unanswered questions in Peter Pan.",1332892800,13,3592,4.462709284627093
4993853,1,B006JN87W0,"I should have read up on it a bit more.  Had no idea this wasn't a ""regular"" movie, but a ""made for TV mini-series"".  It shows once you start watching...totally low budget and obviously made for TV.  That being said, I've seen some great made for TV mini-series and have a few.  This one is garbage and almost unwatchable.  Don't know how it has this many stars...must be from people employed to review it positively.

4993854,4,B006JN87W0,"This is a fairly decent prequel to ""Peter Pan."" The two part film spends a good amount of time in London before they go off to Neverland. The movie has adventure and comedy. It is an excellent tween film and for the young at heart. The CG background looks like something from an RPG. The plot reminded me of Avatar, but then what doesn't now a days.

I do have some complaints. What was with the Slim Shady hair-do on Tinker Bell and why don't her lips move when she talks? Q'orianka Kilcher as Aaya left much to be desired. According to the film, they are in a different galaxy at the center of the universe, but they can still see Orion, 3 stars in our galaxy. This is simply impossible. If you are going to write sc-fi fantasy, why include unimportant details that are so wrong?

The movie sets up for a sequel as Hook doesn't yet have his hook. Passable film for family night. Some violence and killing. Big Spider and croc. Naked back on Anna Friel with some innuendos. PG stuff.",1332633600,,984,4.342391304347826
4993855,5,B006JN87W0,"Neverland is as brilliant as it is magical with beautiful imagery and fantastic acting.  I truly enjoyed this prequel to the classic fairy tale.

If you ever wondered how Peter Pan ended up in Neverland in the first place and what happened to him before he met Wendy, this movie has all the answers. Peter was a foster child to none other than, James Hook.  He and his friends (the lost boys) were theives who would do jobs for Hook in exchange for a roof over their heads, food on the table and clothes on their backs. One job in particular led them to the orb that magically transported all of them, with the exception of Peter, into Neverland.  Peter soon follows them to Neverland on a quest to save his friends.  There he befriends a tribe of Indians who help him, he rescues his friends from the pirates who have captured them and he meets Tinker Belle who saves his life.  He soon discovers who Hook really is and to what extent he would go to get what he wants from Peter.

Overall, I thorougly enjoyed this fun and fantasic tale.  This prequel was an exciting and engaging adventure and the perfect addition to a beloved classic.  The ending leaves it open for a sequel and I sure would love to see Syfy's take on the classic when Peter meets Wendy.",1332633600,8,1258,4.387931034482759

8499477,1,B006JN87W0,"A DIY collage of sequences stolen from popular movies stitched into a mindless story that promises a lot more than it delivers. NOTE: Putting women in positions of power does not mean that power is changed, challenged, or questioned. Gender  B.S. aside, this film reinforces the belief that bullies win.  As if winning is even the point. What a pathetically stupid waste of energy to produce a film like this when we must learn how to collaborate and share resources on this precious planet.

8499478,2,B006JN87W0,"sorry, but this was pretty boring.  I didn't like the characters or the many plot holes such as... crocs.  they conveniently stay away from canoes, submerged children, splashing oars and mayhem but hone in on a tiny bit o meat in an instant or watch for dispatched pirates. How bout why hundreds year old children still act like.. .children.  I could go on but won't as there were many beautiful bits of the movie as well, mainly the lush gorgeous landscapes and environments, the fairies cgi, the ship, costumes and etc.

I found the lead actor for Peter boring and obnoxious.  In fact, he was a nightmare and his actions doomed so many to death, over and over.  It was annoying.  the last line of the film where Peter declares ""This is OUR land!"" right in front of the Indians who were there before them was cringe inducing.",1529280000,,826,4.54054054054054
