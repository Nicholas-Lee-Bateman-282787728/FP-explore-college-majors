8551095,1,B00AFQSZ8S,"Four young girls go to the city to party. They are chased, beaten, and tortured by three males...because they can. The film is shot at night, so most of the scenes are dark. In one scene the three males harass a prostitute in the city, the next scene she is in the middle of the dark woods getting stabbed by guys running by her, who can apparently see in the dark while she can't.

The girls drink heavily, but have all their wits about them. There is a ridiculous slow motion torture scene. I haven't figured out what that was about. It is beating up women just for the sake of beating up women, although the guys seemed to be into necrophilia, which we almost got to see. Not recommended. Go find something with David Hess.

Parental Guide: f-bombs, near rape. Brief dismembered torso nudity?",1390435200,,795,4.475862068965517
8551096,1,B00AFQSZ8S,"Now, I'm all for a good ""slasher"" film, even if the content occasionally crosses the line in terms of being graphic and bloody. But when there is basically no story, just innocent young women being dragged into the woods and butchered, shot, slashed, and disembowled, it really becomes just pointless.

The story is a tired one, especially if you have seen ""Surviving the Game."" Basically these guys in a van kidnap young women and set them free in the woods and hunt them, slaughtering them after they catch them of course. There is absolutely no development with the characters, just an ongoing onslaught of senseless torture. The DVD cover compares the movie favorably to ""Last House on the Left"" but the storyline does not even come close. On the front of the DVD, however, it does read ""they should have stayed at home.""

Well, the actors and writers of the script should have stayed at home, anyways.",1364688000,3,906,4.764331210191083
8551097,1,B00AFQSZ8S,"I thought this movie would be okay.  As always, I am sometimes fooled by the artwork on the box cover.  This time I was really tricked.  This movie was stupid and absolutely terrible.  My one word is :  DON'T.  I would not rent or (absolutely not) buy this.",1360972800,5,257,4.25
