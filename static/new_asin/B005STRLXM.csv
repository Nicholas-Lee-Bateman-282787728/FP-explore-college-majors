4887147,5,B005STRLXM,"Here I should note that I enjoyed the movie, but it would have been better had it been more factual. One example is that the Second Seminole War was begun when an unscrupulous slave trader captured Osceola's favorite wife to make her a slave, and Osceola retaliated by burning down Fort King. Osceola was in fact betrayed under a flag of truce, but he was not killed by a competing chief at Fort King, which had been razed. He had been sent to Fort Moultrie in South Carolina, and he died of either malaria or yellow fever. On the other hand, the movie did get it right about his name being Billy Powell, and he was of mixed European and Creek Indian ancestry. Also, we should note that Seminole means breakaway or runaway, and the tribe was composed of a mixture of Creeks, Cherokees, and runaway slaves.

Also, while not directly related to the movie, I will make a point, and this seems to be lost on Hollywood. The two most expensive Indian wars, in terms of blood and treasure, were fought in the Southeastern US, and they were the two Seminole and the Creek wars, respectively. Often this pitted whites and Indians that were friends against each other, and no matter which side it entailed, there was great remorse when a friend was killed in battle. Unfortunately, they were caught up in the throes of each's way of life trying to preserve itself.

4887149,5,B005STRLXM,As a Florida native I had never seen or heard of this movie. I got it and was very pleased with it. It was very entertaining and informational about the Seminole Indian Chief Osceola that I didn't know. I enjoyed the movie very much and recommend it strongly for those that like history movies.,1327017600,7,294,4.462962962962963
4887150,4,B005STRLXM,"This was the first DVD from Brazil that I ordered and I am very happy I did. The picture is very sharp, the sound is quite adequate and color is great. They had an original techniclor print for a master and the colors are very rich. The audio is in english, and the Portugese subtitles easily removed. The DVD also contains the original trailer. You don't need an all region player. This film has never been released here in the United States.

Recent West Point graduate Lance Caldwell (Rock Hudson) is sent to Florida, his home, to help Major Degan (Richard Carlson) forceably remove the Seminoles lead by Chief Osceola from the ancient home land. They don't want to go and are resisting. Caldwell grew up with the Seminoles and knows they are not warlike and offers to try to talk to them. Degan tells him the time for talk is over and he is mounting an expedition to attack them.

Caldwell also renews his relationship with Rever Muldoon (Barbara Hale) whom he loves and also wants to find out what happened to his best friend John Powell (Anthony Quinn). Both had been accepted to West Point and John whould have been the first Indian accepted to the Academy but on the day they were to leave John didn't show up and disappeared.

Degan's expedition ends in a disaster. Only Degan and two other men escape. Caldwell is captured. Caldwell learns that Osceola is his friend John and John and Revere are in love. Osceola still wants peace and is tricked by Degan into coming to Fort Lincoln where he is immediately imprisoned and beaten.

This is a good solid western directed by Budd Boetticher with a great cast: Rock Hudson, Anthony Quinn, Barbara Hale, Richard Carlson, Lee Marvin and Hugh O'Brian. It also has some tough violent action and like many westerns from the 1950's a more adult plot and characters. My only complaint is that the movie deserved a bigger budget.",1302825600,5,1877,4.627627627627628

4887152,4,B005STRLXM,"Good outdoor western but don't buy the Vault Series version. Now available on an 8 western pressed version for $6.00. Both Universal and Columbia are pulling this stunt. You buy a DVD-R for too much money and then they release the titles on more reasonably priced collections. How about charging $10 in the first place. Collectors should quit paying inflated prices. After all, the companies are saving money with these pressed to order discs. It's time they pass the savings onto their customers.",1436313600,,497,5.0

4887154,5,B005STRLXM,"Wonderful early Hudson movie made while he was an up and coming contract player. Many years ago when AMC was strictly a commercial free movie channel they showed so many Hudson and Tony Curtis movies that were made when both actors were contract players on their way to stardom. More of these types of movies made by all studios, should be released on DVD",1422662400,,355,4.5625

4887159,4,B005STRLXM,"Terrific old fashion western from Universal. Rick Hudson is very good and Anthony Quinn's versatility is always amazing. He can play anything. It's an excellent print and an exciting western, the kind Universal used to crank out in the 1950's.",1379980800,,243,5.1

One in a series of movies of the early Fifties to take a pro-Indian stance. Color is vivid and the ratio is accurately  full-frame. Good entertainment.",1358121600,6,310,4.849056603773585

8485505,5,B005STRLXM,"In the era of low budget potboiler Westerns, this 1953 film stands the test of time.  It is, of course, not a proper Western at all: a frontier film set in Florida, recounting the United States' Army undeclared ""conflict"" with the Seminole nation under its warchief Osceola (Anthony Quinn).  Unlike many of its contemporaries this film strived for authenticity down to the American army uniforms and Seminole costumes and warpaint.  Also remarkable is this movie's appearance in the heart of McCarthyism, a veiled critique of US policies by a backward glance at the historical record.  It's more the story of the US and its military than the Seminoles and Osceola.  In the forced marches through the ""jungle"" (the word is even used in the film) we see an uncanny, prophetic foretaste of the US experience in Vietnam, down to an attempted ""My Lai"" foiled by crafty Red warriors.  When the prototypical ""liberal traitor"" Lance Caldwell (Rock Hudson) accuses commanding Major Degan (Richard Carlson) of having lost his sense of ""honor and decency"" we can only further marvel at the prescience of scriptwriter  Charles K. Peck; and his success at avoiding the blacklist by this telling criticism of American attitudes toward ""foreign nations"" at the height of cold war smugness. No doubt Lt. Caldwell's almost-sealed fate before a firing squad was a chilling reminder of that world outside the theater, with its loyalty oaths and Senate committees. The Major's betrayal of Osceola's trusting search for peace before an intransigent, self-righteous American military presence still rings true to many around the globe.",1485907200,,1613,5.180769230769231
8485506,4,B005STRLXM,"A pretty good not factual film about two young men and a young woman. The two men like the woman. One man goes off to West Point. The other, whose mother was an Indian, goes to join his tribe. The first graduates as a second lieutenant and the second becomes an Indian Chief who wants peace with the whites. The first is assigned as a second command to a Major who hates Indians and is determined to destroy the Seminole tribe, but he wants to bring about peace.
The major sends word to the chief that he can come to the fort and will not be harmed. The major said he wants peace, but this is a lie. The chief is beaten and imprisoned.
The chief is killed while in captivity and the second lieutenant is on trial for the murder of the soldier guarding him. He has no evidence to prove his innocence.",1482278400,,799,4.194805194805195
