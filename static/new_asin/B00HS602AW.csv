8635362,4,B00HS602AW,"I like working out with Cindy Whitmarsh.  She has a good personality- encouraging and motivating, so I was happy that she has come out with some new dvds.  In this dvd there were several different exercises that I hadn't seen before, and that kept my interest up.  I also liked that each exercise is repeated just enough to work your muscles but not enough to be boring.  Another thing I liked is that when she does an exercise that works one side of your body, she then goes on to an exercise that is neutral, before repeating that first exercise on the other side of the body.  It gives you kind of a little break in boredom and muscle work.

This dvd consists of two 20 minutes workouts - one is cardio and the other one is sculpting and stretching.  It would have been a 5 star for me, except that I felt the workouts were somewhat rushed, and would have flowed better if lengthened to 30 minutes each.  This was especially true of the cardio workout - there is NO warm-up and little cool-down. Cindy Whitmarsh is such a high-level trainer, I thought she would have known better.  So,  I would recommend doing the sculpting workout first, to get yourself warmed up, and then go on to the cardio.  This is, if your time schedule  permits.  Otherwise, be sure you warm up on your own before doing the cardio workout by itself.  So, having said all that, I really do like both of the workout routines.  All in all, I'm glad I have added this DVD my collection.",1421020800,5,1461,4.379182156133829
