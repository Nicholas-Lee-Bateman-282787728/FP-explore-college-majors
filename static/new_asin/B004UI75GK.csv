8441552,1,B004UI75GK,Below average lessons. No real explanation of what is being taught. Just watch a guy sitting at the drum set play a beat and then it gives you a time to practice along. Not worth the money. Better off watching lessons on YouTube.,1430265600,,229,4.348837209302325
8441553,1,B004UI75GK,"This video claims to be an intermediate level but it is definitely for beginners.  That, and all these drum fills they claim will help you broaden your creativity sound the same.  Total trash.  Wished I never bought it.",1395273600,,219,4.7105263157894735
