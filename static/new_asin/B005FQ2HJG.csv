4684362,5,B005FQ2HJG,"I have loved the band ever since CTA came out, but I was reminded of just how brilliant they were and are while watching Larry David's classic comedy 'Clear History'. Not only does the soundtrack contain some Chicago classics, but some of the band, including Robert, make a hilarious cameo appearance when the band play a concert at Martha's Vineyard.

This concert is excellent and contains every Chicago favorite that you could possibly be looking for. 25 or 6 to 4 (referring to the time in the morning it was written), Saturday In The Park, Beginnings, I'm A Man, Hard To Say I'm Sorry... you name it..

The band, half of which are original members, deliver big time in this performance and the quality is full-on across the board.

A very satisfying experience.",1388448000,7,766,4.7443609022556394

collection.  It also contains three of Chicago's best hits since they formed in 1967.  This DVD also contains

I have replaced this twice and both copies didn't have any audio files.  Not going to try again.  I will order the Chicago - Earth Wind and Fire Live at the Greek.
