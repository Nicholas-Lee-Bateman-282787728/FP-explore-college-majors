7952189,3,B00005RFPP,"Not a bad glimpse at NFL 2000 and the Baltimore-NYG SB XXXV.  It doesn't quite live up to it's title, though, as the on-line editorial review suggests.  While the camera-work and the interactive features and the great audio make for an ""entertaining-enough"" hour, I was hoping for an inside look at the NFL.  What I got was a very glamorous version of ""NFL Presents.""  I was hoping to spend more time in the locker room, on the practice field, in meetings, watching film, and in the huddle.  Yes, Peyton Manning broke down ONE play --- but if you are a serious football fan and want to learn things about the NFL game that you don't know already, then this DVD is not for you.  Unless you just can't stand the off-season like me!  If you are a casual fan or, hey, maybe you're trying to get your spouse interested in the game, then this might be a keeper.  High on quality, Low on the INSIDER angle.",1012867200,13,899,4.373493975903615
