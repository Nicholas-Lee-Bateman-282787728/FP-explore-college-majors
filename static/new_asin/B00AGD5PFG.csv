8551350,5,B00AGD5PFG,"Besides being very fun and refreshing to watch, I've learned a lot from the places featured. There's a lot more to do and enjoy in northern Mexico that I had no idea was there, also some great restaurants and hidden treasures that I want to try now.
Though I didn't buy from Amazon, it's nice to know they carry it now. There's a second season on PBS too.",1359072000,,355,4.235294117647059
