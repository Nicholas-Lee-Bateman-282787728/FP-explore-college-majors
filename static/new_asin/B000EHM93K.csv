8109714,5,B000EHM93K,"The movie Radio Inside is a real tear jerker. There is a love triagle between two brothers,and a woman. The movie shows how the two brothers deal with guilt,and pain,at the loss of their father. One brother seeks work far away from the pain. The other meets the pain head on. I enjoyed this movie very much,and highly recommend this flic...The movie is an import. You will need a multi-region,mutizone zone dvd.player that outputs to ntsc...The movie is {region two{,and won't play on standard dvd players...Thank you Stewart L.",1140566400,,528,4.943820224719101
