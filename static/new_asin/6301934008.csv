When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.

That being said, I'd recommend getting the newer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fraggle-Rock-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B002LYD2LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fraggle Rock: Complete Series Collection</a>&nbsp;DVD set.

7817856,5,6301934008,"This is an episode of Fraggle Rock, a TV show made by the Jim Henson company starring a group of Muppet characters called Fraggles who live in underground caves and like to sing.

  In ""Marooned,"" Boober and Red Fraggle are trapped in a tiny space after a cave-in. Red is usually a very spunky, cheerful Fraggle, and Boober is notoriously negative, the Eeyore of Fraggle Rock, if you will. They never really understood each other, but now that they are facing death, they forget about their differences and learn a lot about each other.

  A particularly moving moment is when, with the ceiling slowly coming down on them, Red turns to Boober and asks, ""What do you think it's like to die?""
  Boober can only answer, ""I don't know. I don't think anybody does.""

  This episode of Fraggle Rock diverges from the normal, happy, joyful mood of the others to explore the idea of our own mortality in a surprisingly blunt yet wonderfully delicate way.

  This episode has some amazing writing and great perfomances from Dave Goelz and Karen Prell as Boober and Red. They brought tears to my eyes. An excellent production. Five stars.",1126310400,,1128,4.717948717948718
