8058845,1,B0009ACZMW,"This was so poorly made, they should give them away for free.  I'd return if I could, but it is an opened DVD.  VERY VERY disappointed. Should have paid more attention to other reviews.  DO NOT BUY!",1471996800,,198,4.297297297297297
8058846,5,B0009ACZMW,"A wonderful, uplifting film about peoples' experiences with life beyond this earth.  A real testimony to the soul that gives meaning to our existence.",1388361600,,150,5.25
8058847,5,B0009ACZMW,"I ordered the book here on Amazon about 4 years ago.  I'm a retired RN and have had people tell me after they were brought back to life different stories over the 30 some years I was a nurse.  I didn't think a lot about it then with the stress of trying to revive a dead body etc.  After retiring I've had time to do the research.  We are energy, souls.  I no longer want to be buried when I die I insist on just being cremated.  This book explains Life and death better than any I've read.  The movie is even better.",1380931200,3,517,3.9611650485436893
8058848,3,B0009ACZMW,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, then very disappointed after seeing it. I am a believer in the soul's journey and afterlife and I thought that I would learn more and get new a perspective. Instead, I saw some very strange people, giving their personal beliefs which were nothing that I have not heard before on the subject. Some of the people looked strangely out of this world. Why am I not surprised?",1195516800,,420,4.5394736842105265
8058849,5,B0009ACZMW,"I was like the previous reviewer.  I had rented it and after watching it the first time, purchased it before I had even returned the rental!  I loved the content, it gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies beyond our human experience.  How lovely to know that there is a life we can barely imagine, waiting to be returned to.  And I didn't learn this fact from the video, I have been studying this subject for many years and already believe, no I KNOW, that there is more that lies beyond this brief stay on Earth.

This video illustrates it so beautifully with people who have had a glimpse into that wonderful place that is our true Home.  People who are dying yet unafraid as they are being shown what is yet to come.  My own Mother saw her Mother as she died.  She came to take her Home.  There is no specific religion addressed here, only the fact that there is more to life than living and dying.  And that it is something to be totally unafraid of.  In fact physical death is only the beginning of something great; it is a step in the evolution of our souls.",1145577600,19,1075,4.246305418719212
8058850,5,B0009ACZMW,"I had the completely opposite reaction to this film from the last reviewer.  I viewed the film as a rental (in fact, twice in one week, which is very rare for me) and appreciated it so much that I am now buying it.

This film is a series of people's personal accounts of their real life experiences, not a presentation of a single philosophy or point of view.  Each person is telling a story of an experience they've had where they have felt closer to something or someone that could be called the soul or spirit, the divine, God, Jesus, a higher power, a different dimension, clear light, or however each person chose to express themselves.  I found the film to have no particular prejudice or religious leanings, as we hear from Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, atheists, a very broad spectrum of religious or spiritual beliefs.  In fact, one of my favorite aspects of the film is that it provides such a diverse range of perspectives rather than trying to steer us towards some particular belief system.

I couldn't even say that it espouses a firm belief in reincarnation.  Some of the stories implied this belief, but not all, again representing a cross section of beliefs.  For example, the primary storytellers about Pre-Birth experiences of the soul were a couple who were so devoutly Christian that the mother describes how she is visited by Jesus who answers her prayers by stopping a miscarriage and escorting her unborn child, who has been reluctant to come onto this earth and be born.

What particularly attracted me to the film is that it looked at the entire cycle of life and how individuals have experienced this at each stage: before birth, during their lives, at death, and after death.  I have seen and enjoyed several films about Near Death experiences, particularly those by Dr. Raymond Moody, one of the leading researchers in Near Death experiences.  But this is the first film I have encountered that looks at the whole cycle of life and death.

I am an avid film buff, viewing 5-7 films a week.  Most of them are spiritually oriented, or at least inspirational or educational enough that I feel enriched after watching them, rather than simply entertained (although it's great if I am also entertained in the process of being inspired or educated).  So I am quite discriminating about what I consider to be a good film, especially one good enough to buy rather than just rent.  And I found this filmmaking to be very well done, with a well-edited blend of these individuals or couples telling their stories, beautiful artwork, an excellent soundtrack, and even some very funny moments.  Jean Houston is so funny in telling her stories she could be a stand-up comedian, which is what her father wanted her to be anyway (it's part of her hilarious stories).  The music was so good, that I'm also hunting for music by the two soundtrack musicians.  There are some well known people telling their stories (Jean Houston, Joan Borysenko, Ram Das, H.H. The Dalai Lama, etc.) as well as many of us more ""common folk.""

So I highly recommend this film to people who really want to explore the possibility of experiencing the soul.  But I do think it wise to rent any film first, including this one, to see if you like it enough to buy it.  If you can't find it at your video store, Netflix has it.  If you're not a Netflix member, you can get a free trial for a couple of weeks and make this one of your selections.  Then if you do like it, I think it would be worthy addition to your spiritual film libray.",1138060800,37,3529,4.638263665594855
8058851,1,B0009ACZMW,"While the concept of this film is entirely interesting to viewers in search of enlightenment especially when it regards birth, death and transition, it sadly fails in quality.

Eliot Jay Rosen hosts this badly filmed documentary in an attempt to show how a soul arrives, leaves and spends one's time on earth. The concept is fascinating and essential to someone on their death bed in my opinion. But the script is haphazard at best with glimpses into the life of a few people dying of cancer, and others who have had life after death experiences. But unfortunately I felt some of the interviewees seemed rather spooky and cultish in their descriptions. Because of this anyone not open to the concept of enlightenment will probably be completely turned off to the idea if they watch this film. For anyone versed on the ideas expressed within this film it is basic at best and just sort of an overview of the theory. The quality of the film is really horrible as if done by amateurs so I found myself being distracted by the film rather than the notion.

Rent it.....the purchase isn't worth the experience.",1126742400,15,1105,4.72020725388601
