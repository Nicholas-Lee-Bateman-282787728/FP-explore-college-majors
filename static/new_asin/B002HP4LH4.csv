3934324,5,B002HP4LH4,One of the best movies I have seen come out of Thailand.  A story of the boundary between love and friendship.  The film is also about family and what it takes to hold family together after loss.  I hope the Director's Cut will be released in the future.  A beautiful film that will last with you long after you finish.  I can't say enough good things about this multilayered film.  Wonderful.,1250208000,6,393,4.464788732394366
3934325,5,B002HP4LH4,"This is an excellent movie.
The actors especially Mario Maurer are so cute and loveable.

The story is a little long-winded but the acting is good, and the story line is very touching.

Must see, if you like gay teen love stories.",1248220800,13,230,4.4523809523809526
3934326,3,B002HP4LH4,"Make no mistake.  The Love of Siam is definitely an excellent movie.  But I would be keep an eye on the current run time listed.  Yeah, it isn't released yet, so it's subject to change.  But 150 minutes is the run time of the Theatrical release.  The Director's Cut's run time is 172 minutes.  Normally, when a movie has a Directors Cut, the extra scenes are often just exposition that serves little purpose.  But in this movie's case, I can safely say that the extra scenes that are put back into the movie definitely tie up some loose ends that originally left some people scratching their heads when they saw the theatrical version.  Just something to keep an eye on, especially considering there is another version of the movie that is fairly international-friendly (though it has its own list of problems including sometimes dismal English for subtitles, and the need to manually correct the incorrect aspect ratio).  And I can already definitively say that alternative has all the original supplementary materials of the Thai release, and then some.",1248048000,24,1055,4.882022471910112

3934338,5,B002HP4LH4,"A very excellent film, fascinating for the glimpses into modern Thailand, but also a wonderful and touching depiction of love and how difficult it can be. At the center are two young men (Tong and Mew, seniors in high school), who share a tender kiss and subsequently have to decide what to do about the feelings they have for one another. Meanwhile, love is challenged everywhere around them: their girlfriends and potential girlfriends are unhappy and in pain, and Tong's family approaches the breaking point after the disappearance of his older sister. The film is very deeply felt, and often harrowing in its depiction of how painful it can be to love someone with all your heart.

It took Asia by storm when it came out and was notable for being the first sympathetic portrayal of gay characters in Thai cinema. It also launched the careers of its two young stars.",1400544000,,869,4.754966887417218
3934339,5,B002HP4LH4,"Best thai movie I've seen.  Great production.  Go there every year and love the people.
The tenderness and family loyalty are typical.  I get geared up every time it see it.  Still.",1386633600,3,181,4.5625
3934340,5,B002HP4LH4,"Truly a beautiful story about love and all the themes of love.
These themes include love between two childhood best friends, the love of a family, the love between a grandmother and her grandson, the love between a father and daughter, unrequited love from a crush, falling out of love, and even gay love that is shunned by society.
The film represents many different forms of love; including the joy of love and the opposite end of the spectrum: the pain of love.
However throughout the movie, the one type of love that outshines the others is the love between two childhood friends that are forced to separate, however are reunited again by fate.
Many may say that the ending of the film was quite painful and depressing to watch, however let me tell you this before you watch the whole movie from beginning to end....
There is one important line within the film that truly makes the viewer think about what really happens in the end of this story and that line is: As long as you love, you'll still have hope. - Mew
So before you have you heart broken by the end of this film , please remember that true love will always find it's way and that Tong and Mew are a one true pairing.",1385251200,3,1183,4.406392694063927
3934341,5,B002HP4LH4,"I watched this over and over again if you don't mind subtitle. It was a story about childhood friends who had experienced difficulties in life, but no matter what, the whole thought is love and care for each other.",1358380800,,214,4.512820512820513
3934342,4,B002HP4LH4,"I lived in Bangkok for 2 years in the 1970's. From the movie Love of Siam, I can see how things have changed. This film concerns a group of very affluent Thai families, their daily lives and loves, and illustrates how far Thailand has come in the past 40 years since I was there. There is now a substantial middle class and upwardly mobile elite.
The film attempts of portray several relationships that are complex and interesting, and does a good job in their portrayal. One scenario concerning the primary husband and wife and their two children is done quite well. The daughter disappears never to be heard from again and the son unwittingly has to become the man of the family with a dominating, neurotic Mother and alcoholic Father.
The son really has alot of sexual identity confusion to deal with. On the one hand, he has a very demanding rigid, childish, neurotic girlfriend to contend with, much like his Mother, and on the other hand, a very talented, nice male friend, who hopes to be his boyfriend.  He is guilted by his Mother's needs to be the man she needs him to be when he begins to develop feelings for his male friend.
Several other stories of people who interact with each other in various roles throughout the film and done quite nicely and by the end of the film, has resolved many of the issues that they have had to deal with throughout the film.
I would recommend this film highly for someone interested in modern Thai society and for teenagers in particularly who want to see how teenager deal with adolescence in another culture.",1337904000,4,1556,4.597122302158273
3934343,5,B002HP4LH4,"This is a wonderfully romantic, tearful, happy, love and friendship movie with great music and the greatest happy end of all times. Maybe you would like ""Love of Siam"" to be more open gay, but that would destroy its sweet-and-sour quality. If you haven't seen it, order it quickly! If in doubt watch the trailer on youtube first.",1333929600,5,329,4.689655172413793
3934344,5,B002HP4LH4,"This movie is beautiful. While long, it does a great job of making that connection between you and the characters. The first twenty minutes is just that: making that connection, while providing a tender background to the rest of the story. The rest of the movie flows beautifully, and the end is satisfying, but leaves you aching on the inside.

Love of Siam is now one of my favorite movies.",1332460800,4,392,4.6
3934345,5,B002HP4LH4,"I have watched this movie every day for the past 2 weeks and will watch it again tonight.  IT'S INCREDIBLE!  The director of this movie is a genius.

The innocence of Mew and Tong will touch your heart over and over.  Don't be fooled by the picture on the DVD. It's not the typical boy-meets-boy romance.  That would be boring.  Instead, it's rich with so many other activities that are going on with everyone else in the movie and how they are all tied together.

Every time I watch this movie, I see deeper levels of meanings in it.  After watching it last night, I couldn't sleep after watching it, it left me with such an incredible feeling that I didn't want to fall asleep.  So I stayed up and enjoyed the feelings this movie gave me.

Of all the gay movies I have seen that deal with romance, THIS IS THE BEST!  This isn't phoney.  This is the real deal.  I hope you'll experience this too.

So PLEASE get this video!  You'll thank me and all the other reviewers that you did.",1325289600,6,983,4.295081967213115
3934346,5,B002HP4LH4,"Once Flaubert wrote that '""To deny the existence of sad feelings just because they are sad, is as to deny the sun just because it is not noon"". This is certainly a thought worth keeping while watching Love of Siam.
This romantic film explores in a touching narrative different forms of love. The main story devolpes without definitions or expectations, in a form of feeling and experiencing love that ends in a unexpected but yet beautiful ending. I strongly recommend this movie, well narrated, well interpreted and touching.",1316908800,3,526,4.988636363636363
3934347,5,B002HP4LH4,"I gave this movie 5 stars because I thought it was an amazing movie. It is definitely worth the price listed. The characters in the movie are great and the actors who played them did an amazing job as well.

This movie deals with family values and culture combining a un-ideal relationship. Mew and Tong have love for each other but will this relationship last???  This movie deals with young adults and finding oneself. Being young myself I related to the movie which I liked. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the ending. It was bitter sweet and wished things could have turned out different. But overall it was a good movie and totally reccomend it.",1309824000,3,667,4.55
3934348,5,B002HP4LH4,Not your typical high school gay movie. It is well acted and very interesting. Would recommend it to anyone that is into stuff like this.,1305072000,3,137,4.52
3934349,2,B002HP4LH4,"Yeah, I get it. If you're gay, there's no happy ending. That seems to be the message at the heart of most dramas centered around same-gender attractions. I won't list any spoilers, but I found the end of this film not worth the long, convoluted journey it takes getting there. Despite a promising start, Tong (Mario Maurer)is a doof whose frustrating indecision made me want to scream. The layers of dysfunctional family drama adds a lot of dialogue and confusion, but there's no real message, no real sense of overcoming. I was looking for a twist, a turning point, but the movie just crawls on down the same, worn rut, dragging your heart along with it to no fulfilling resolution.

Films (and books as well) like this do little more than wag a finger at gays and say, ""See, that's what your life is going to be - suffering."" The fact that there is no gay hustler character and the film doesn't end with a suicide is a step in the right direction, but to me, it's a small consolation. This film twists the heart, but in the end, leaves you depressed and unfulfilled.",1285286400,12,1068,4.505154639175258
3934350,4,B002HP4LH4,"The movie is well written, well acted, and a tear jerker.  It is amazing that these young people are so talented.  The music score, actually sang by the actor, is great.
This movie is a tear jerker and you may not agree with the ending, but life seldom ends the way you want.  That only happens in a Disney movie.  I saw this movie through a movie rental and had to buy it after seeing it.  It is in Thai with English subtitles.  The first time I watched the movie I spent a lot of time reading the subtitles.  But the second time I watched.  I was able to really get into the movie even more now knowing what they where saying.  This wonderful movie is really a great love story.  Hope you enjoyed it, as much as I did.",1278633600,4,720,4.078571428571428
3934351,5,B002HP4LH4,"I bought this DVD weeks ago, but didn't watch it until a few days ago.  I bought the DVD because I had read good things about the movie previously and had chalked it up to something to watch one day when I didn't have anything else to do.  Well, having watched it now, I can officially label this my latest ""crush"" film.  ""Crush"" films are those films that I enjoy so much that I go back and watch 'em again the next day.... and I replay favorite scenes again and again, almost to the point of knowing exactly what the characters are going to say before they say it....and where I go on the internet and look for reviews and interviews and....well, you get the picture.

This film is wonderful.  I'm not going to claim that I liked everything that happened in the story, but the movie, overall, is one of the sweetest, tenderest and most touching portrayals of teenage/first love that I've seen on film.  There is a real innocence that comes across from the two actors, and although it is true that there is much more in the movie than their love story, the relationship of Mew and Tong is the center, and purpose, of the whole movie.

Some have claimed that the film is too long.  I disagree. I never even noticed the time.  And now I am going to try and find a copy of the Director's cut, which is longer than the version on this DVD, and which also contains deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage and all of the other goodies that I have come to love about DVD's.

I recommend this movie.",1268179200,14,1494,4.32258064516129
3934352,2,B002HP4LH4,"This budding romance is a bit...slow.  I was a bit disappointed with the story line but then again, I find it quite difficult for Asians to do a well coming out or coming of age story.  This is my opinion.  I would reccomend that you save your money and not view it.",1265068800,3,266,4.076923076923077
3934353,5,B002HP4LH4,"**** ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR ****

  i don't know where this director got the 4 young men for the parts of MEW and TONG,  but this is one the best acted films i have seen.
  the young men a excellent actors.  they should be extra proud to be able to carry this story line.
 Also, whom ever picked the music for this film has a excellent ear.  i have
watched this film twice, 1st for the great acting / story,  and 2nd to listen to
the music.  all the music fits each scene with a BANG.

3934354,5,B002HP4LH4,"This is my favorite film ever. The story is very moving. I saw it twice in the theater when it was released in Thailand. I still cry when I watch it.

The acting is a bit spotty, especially early on. Mario got a lot of attention, but as far as I am concerned Pitch (Mew) is the real star of this film. His acting is extremely natural and you believe him at every love-struck second. The other character that I found extremely heroic is Ying.

The film has a great soundtrack as well. And I always love seeing Bangkok on film.

I love the fact that this is not a ""Hollywood"" movie.

Get your hands on the Director's Cut if you can. It clocks in at another 15 or 20 minutes longer but the scenes that have been cut for this version go a long way to explaining a number of things that don't quite make sense.",1256256000,7,805,4.10828025477707

3934356,5,B002HP4LH4,"I just watched this in the local cinema
Wat can I say?
Simply a beautiful wonderful movie
A simple love story about love in all its forms, gay, straight, family, friends etc.
The cast is uniformly good especially the 2 leads.
You really do feel and root for them.

What do you do when u love someone and it is not reciprocated?
Do you want that someone to be happy?
What if the love u have for someone is forbidden?
Or if your love for someone lost is stiffling and killing you?

Brilliant music & songs even though I do not understand Thai that doesn't mean you cannot appreciate the lovely songs in this movie.
The young cast is uniformly good looking especially the actor acting as Tong.
He is just stunning!
Sure, it might be a bit draggy at times but definitely worth sitting thru.
Highly recommended!",1250380800,10,806,4.4391891891891895
