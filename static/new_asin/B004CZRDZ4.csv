8424584,2,B004CZRDZ4,"Is the central character of this rather tedious drama the repressed Phillip (played by ""West Side Story's"" Richard Beymer) or the obsequious houseguest Walter (Maximillian Schell, Oscar-winning star of ""Judgement at Nuremberg"")? Or is it Rosalind Russell's Louise, the overbearing matriarch? Perhaps her coarse, resentful husband Stanley? (British actor Jack Hawkins) Who are we supposed to be rooting for? Worried about? Phillip offers a clue filled with foreboding, right from the start: ""We're not a family,"" he tells Walter, his little sister's music tutor. ""We're a tribe of cannibals. We eat people.""
As the film progresses my sympathies swing back and forth from Walter to Louise to Phillip and back again. Louise is so desperately unhappy in her marriage to her resentful, working-class husband it's not difficult to understand her growing attraction to the yourhful, handsome Walter, who is so exotically European and so eager to please his wealthy benefactress.
Then there's Phillip, the ""sensitive"" son whose ""sensitive"" nature--you begin to feel you could play a drinking game with the word--is a continuing disappointment to his gruff, manly father. Phillip's unrequited attraction to Walter brings out the worst in him, as his veiled insinuations and spiteful accusations mirror his mother's shattered delusions.
The climax, which I didn't see coming but probably should have, leads to a wrap-up ending that is as dishonest as it is unconvincing. But then this is a 1961 mainstream studio release attempting ""daring"" subject matter--what could we expect?",1518998400,,1568,5.483471074380165

I could go on at length about the inadequate direction and ineffective acting, but will only mention one
moment that exemplifies the film's failure: Rosalind Russell, for no reason, walks into a record store
and there, in the distance, is the easily identifiable cover to the soundtrack album of AUNTIE MAME!",1471651200,,402,5.014925373134329

8424588,4,B004CZRDZ4,"I am somewhat surprised at the plethora of poor reviews on this gem of a movie.  Sure, it has its moments, but it is most definitely better than the crap one may find on television or the movie theater in today's world.  Ms. Russell is wonderful in this movie, as well as Maximilian.  I find myself able to hang to the story line, even though at times it seems to be over acted and filled with sugary fluff.  I recommend this movie to any Russell or early sixties movie fan.",1417737600,3,474,4.233333333333333
8424589,1,B004CZRDZ4,"Shown recently on TCM and seen for the first time by me, Daniel Mann's film version of Peter Shaffer's two-act family drama ""Five Finger Excercise"" is a clinical example of how a screen transition can do almost everything wrong. The setting has been changed from an English country home to a California getaway, and the characters have consequently been altered to seem more American. For instance, the son's name has been changed from Clive to Phillip and there are no references to Monte Carlo. Opening scenes are much too light, the sparkly music score and the kid sister's bouncy personality preparing the viewer for all the solemnity of a sitcom. The acting doesn't help what should be a sobering mood. Rosalind Russell is the overbearing mother, but whereas on the stage Jessica Tandy made Louise an intimidating matriarch, Russell makes her simply irritating, the type of hostess who could kill a cocktail party in ten minutes. Granted, she's a poseuse who gets ""Electra"" mixed up with ""Oedipus Rex"", but Russell handles all this with fluttery gestures and a nonchalant voice, very much like an ignorant version of Auntie Mame. The result is we can't take her drive very seriously. The urbane Jack Hawkins (who, oddly enough, was once married to Jessica Tandy) is woefully miscast and overacts as a coarse businessman, sarcastic to his wife and unsympathetic to his son. And poor Richard Beymer: he has all the stilted screen presence of a Ken doll, not at all involved in the scenes with other characters. As a gentle live-in tutor dealing with this impossible family, Maximilian Schell tries hard to be convincingly charming, though one gets a little weary of his Old World grinning and bowing. The screen play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett (Shaffer must have been appalled) becomes increasingly melodramatic, motives increasingly unclear. Near the end of the story the young daughter goes too far into the surf and becomes hostile and hysterical when the tutor rescues her, the whole episode causing unnecessary confusion. And when Louise becomes physically attracted to the tutor, the somewhat competitive attitude towards her son is vague because the boy's latent homosexuality has been eliminated from the script. Mann ends all this with a scene straight out of soap opera, the family members all smiling and tactile, the paternal oaf laden down with books, making sure the audience understands that as the world turns life can be beautiful, even at the expense of serious and honest drama.",1332460800,8,2512,5.055421686746988
