7900306,5,7885142655,"When it comes to twisted subject matter, the Japanese win hands down. Lots of these weird movies are truly bizarre with names like ""Big Tit Zombie"" and ""Tokyo Gore Police"", while others deal with more serious but equally bizarre and taboo subjects like Battle Royale. I doubt INCITE MILL will gain the notoriety of Battle Royale, but its an interesting, entertaining, and well done film nevertheless with a ""who's who"" of Japanese star actors. The plot is simple: Ten people who agree to take the same lucrative ""job"" find themselves locked in an underground complex and forced to play a murder game for seven days. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot, and you end up wondering ""what would I do"" when you watch this film. Very enjoyable, and not likely to get major distribution outside of Japan. This is a very well made DVD, with a nice picture and sound. It will play in any USA player.",1304121600,4,901,4.567901234567901
