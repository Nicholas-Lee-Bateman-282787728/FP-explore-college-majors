8268413,2,B00186DF16,"I purchased this DVD along with level 2 and have owned many RHM lessons in the past (Rob Arnold, Alexi series, Rusty series). I did not carefully consider how basic level 1 would be and I have been playing bass for 10+ years. The DVD covers exceptionally basic concepts such as ""Parts of the Bass"" and how to hold the bass. It coves very basic scales like the major and minor. I gave the DVD its fair chance and watched it continuously without pausing.

The instructor has a wide variety of bass guitars he uses which I found entertaining. He frequently uses effects which are never explained.

There is some good information for an absolute beginner in the DVD, however at times I could see that same beginner very confused because of the use of the effects and the intermittent diversions from the lesson between parts.",1418774400,,821,4.616438356164384
