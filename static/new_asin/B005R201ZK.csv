8484005,4,B005R201ZK,"I have had the pleasure of seeing this cute little film once and would love to own it.  It is a good  example of the earliest films of Hollywood's delightful Golden Age. Future super screen idol, Tyrone Power had a small role in the movie, and I do believe this was his first appearance on film.  I have heard rumors that it will soon be available on DVD in the USA!!",1369958400,2,367,4.140845070422535
