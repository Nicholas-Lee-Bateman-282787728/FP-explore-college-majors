8421094,1,B001L4L9JK,"This video was not at all useful for me as a teacher.  I wanted to have some kind of video with actual people treating actual animals (interacting).  Most of the video is of one woman, who, however well-intentioned, talked too much and too long.
She also looks as if she's just had a bout with a severe illness.  Her clothing is far too big for someone her size.  She looks ill.

If she is, I am sympathetic.  However, I feel I wasted my money.  The video was intended to supplement a chapter my students are reading called "":Ou r Dogs are Watching Us.""  It is an interesting chapter explaining how dogs have become so observant of humans, that they respond to us more intuitively than previously thought.  I'd like to send this back!",1382486400,3,734,4.458646616541353
