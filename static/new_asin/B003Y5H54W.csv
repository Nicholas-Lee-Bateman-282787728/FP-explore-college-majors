4219730,2,B003Y5H54W,"Let me get this out of the way: I'm mid-30's, married, and watch the Twilight movies as a guilty pleasure even though they are tragically reduced from the books.  So Red Riding Hood, having the same director as the original Twilight movie, looked to have potential for similar entertainment.  I was wrong.  This movie is outright hokey and awkward.  The characters walk around a lot with no purpose, and the dialogue was embarrassing to watch at times.  The actors (aside from Amanda Seyfried) seemed very uncomfortable and disjointed from their roles - like people trying to present something they didn't study enough - no confidence and not convincing at all.  It felt very watered down.

I wanted to like it and kept trying, but the story line was weak and the special effects were bad (like 1980's bad).  The only good part was that the identity of the werewolf remained a mystery and was not obvious at all.

This is such an imitation Twilight in so many ways - too bad it didn't work!  I know it's an alluring trailer and that you'll probably watch it anyway, but I bet a lot of you will be back to write your own similar, disappointed reviews.  As for taking another look... no thanks.  One time was enough.",1300233600,3,1214,4.595348837209302

4219732,4,B003Y5H54W,"2011's ""Red Riding Hood"" is a Grimm's fairy tale reset as a suspenseful monster saga for modern teenagers.  It features a good ensemble cast, atmospheric sets and music, and a love story wrapped around a murder mystery.

The story opens in a medieval village, nestled in an almost mythical mountain landscape surrounded by dark snowy forests.  The village has been haunted for generations by a werewolf, who is held at bay by sacrifices of livestock.  A young woman named Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) faces a more pressing personal dilemma.  She is betrothed to the well-off but dull Henry, but holds her heart for poor but handsome chum Peter.

The abrupt murder of Valerie's sister by the werewolf changes everything.  The villagers hunt the werewolf, and come back with a head.  To their sorrow, they will find they are mistaken, a fact pointed out by Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), a ruthless priest who hunts werewolves with a group of commando-like warriors.

The plot cleverly hands out all kinds of clues and suspects; it would be a sharp-eyed viewer who picks out the killer in advance.  Valerie herself is a suspect, and faces some terrible choices on the way to a thrilling conclusion.  Recommended.",1299974400,,1206,4.9502487562189055
4219733,5,B003Y5H54W,"As someone who is enchanted by myth and fairytale for what it tells us about how we see ourselves I thoroughly enjoyed this visual adaptation of a classic story. I felt that it managed to remain true to the original themes of the Riding Hood tales and was pleased with the heroine's final destiny. Although it may bear a certain striking resemblance to the Twilight movies it certainly provides us with a much more complex and, quite frankly, courageous female lead. If you are looking for excitement, action, and terror then this is not the movie for you. However, if you are able to appreciate the nuance of the original tale in this striking visual format I would highly recommend it.",1299888000,15,687,4.68595041322314
4219734,5,B003Y5H54W,"I just came back from the theater and I loved it! Cinematography, sets, all fantastic.  Storyline unique in that it blends the traditional fairytale, a few elements from the earlier and wonderful ""The Company of Wolves"", and brings it to a more mature audience with a twist. Who done it? Who is the big bad wolf?  The movie is fast paced, intricate, cleverly drawing on relationships both new and old, thwarted love, etc. all in a picturesque Grimm-like village and cottages that you are just dying to live in!  Well, if you stay in this neighbourhood, that might be arranged! Far from predictable you will be finding yourself switching gears over a dozen times trying to figure it out. And the ending?  My what sharp teeth you have!  Enjoy as I did!  A must see for any fan of fairytales and fantasy movies, or if you are a fan of Tim Burton, for it isn't too far from his style!  Now I can't wait for the DVD and hope a soundtrack comes. I love the music from the festival!",1299888000,90,975,4.41340782122905
4219735,5,B003Y5H54W,"I love, love, loved this movie!!!! It is amazing, fun, and tragically beautiful. All the actors were perfectly casted. You have to watch this movie.",1299888000,2,148,4.96
4219736,1,B003Y5H54W,"Teenage girl + sexy brooding might-be-a-monster + forbidden romance = dear Lord, it's a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B003ZKBELG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>&nbsp;knockoff.

And let's not delude ourselves that ""Red Riding Hood"" is anything but that. Catherine Hardwicke (director of the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B003ZKBELG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>&nbsp;film) runs over very familiar territory in this disastrously dull, tepidly acted borefest, which seems to just be an excuse to show us yet more gel-haired, pouting teenagers longing after each other. It's even duller than it sounds.

Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) lives in a small village in... somewhere where they sacrifice livestock to a giant ravenous wolf. It's not explained very well. She is planning to escape an arranged marriage to the staggeringly dull Henry (Max Irons) by eloping with her staggeringly dull Edward-Cullen-haired lover Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). You know, standard love triangle stuff.

But then the wolf comes to the town and starts killing people, including Valerie's sister. According to wolf-hunter (Gary Oldman), it's not a wolf but a werewolf. Even worse, the werewolf has some kind of connection to Valerie -- meaning that it's probably someone she loves. So who is the werewolf, and does anyone in the audience actually care?

Don't worry, Team Jacob -- ""Red Riding Hood"" is all about the hot maybe-werewolf guy taking center stage. Catherine Hardwicke tosses aside the possibilities of a ""dark"" psychosexual retelling of a fairy tale, mainly so she can try to reel in all the screeching hormone-addled tweenagers who rushed to see her last gothic romance.

The problem is, ""Twilight"" was boring. And ""Red Riding Hood"" is even duller.  The only competent part of the story is the plot twist involving the werewolf.

The rest of the time we're treated to pallid romantic melodrama is almost as bloodless as the CGI wolf attacks. The dialogue is ghastly (""It is time to put on your HARLOT'S ROBES!""), and the there are some staggeringly weird scenes that add absolutely nothing to the story, such as a giant metal ELEPHANT, or the medieval rave. Then again, the picturesque village looks like the love child of a RenFaire and a Medieval Times restaurant, so maybe the rave isn't too surprising.

I'll admit it: Seyfried's clear face and big wide eyes are perfect (in theory), but Hardwicke seems less interested in having her act than in having her pose dramatically as if she's in a magazine shoot. Her two paramours are so dull that they're virtually interchangeable, except for Fernandez's gelled-up hair.

And Gary Oldman is so hammy you could put him between two slices of rye -- his ""evil inquisitor"" role is so over-the-top that I kept expecting him to poke Seyfried with the soft cushions and scream, ""Confess! Confess! CONFESS!""

""Red Riding Hood"" is basically Hardwicke's attempt to snag ""Twilight's"" teenybopper fanbase, but she only succeeds in making a movie even more passionless and dull than that one.",1299801600,8,3150,5.6265822784810124
4219737,2,B003Y5H54W,"Has it become increasingly difficult to write an ending? Have writers suddenly forgotten that the climax is the high point of a story? Or is Hollywood getting lazy? Red Riding Hood is probably the most frustrating and unsatisfying movie I've been to, and the above reason is just one of many. While it certainly isn't bad, I haven't finished feeling so let down since Haneke's ""The White Ribbon"".

Of course, Hardwicke is a director who is willing take big risks. She did so with Twilight, which was a huge smash with teens everywhere. And she does have a good eye for a shot, and several scenes here show. If had to recommend the movie for one thing alone, it would be for the visuals. The look of the film has a gorgeous, lush and colourful palette that made this film worth seeing on the big screen.

The film's biggest problem aside from being anti-climatic is that the plot is just... a mangled mess. It reads like a really bad fanfiction. If you thought Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland was bad... .wait till you get a load of this movie. We have several plot points that come in and suddenly are left do die, one of which includes Father Solomon played by Gary Oldman, who is made to be a crazy bastard type character, and we don't see anything to prove it. To top it all off, it's rife with clichs, like the obligatory love triangle, the whodunit, damned protagonist.

The actors are a mixed bag. Seyfried does a good job here and has plenty of emotion in her performance. She has plenty of cheesy lines but she does a good job for what she has to work with. Gary Oldman was also great, but that was expected as he always shines with every performance. On the downside, Shiloh Fernandez gives one of the worst performances ever here. He spends the whole movie looking like he wants to punch someone and reads his lines like he's reading them off a paper. And Virginia Madsen just awful here as well, and is over-acting Billy Burke.

In short Red Riding Hood is a film that has plenty of promise, but sadly doesn't live up to it. It isn't a bad film by any means, but you are most likely to leave disappointed.",1299715200,3,2117,4.434447300771208
4219738,3,B003Y5H54W,"Here's the math:

An old-fashioned romance + Werewolves = Red Riding Hood (2011)?

Doesn't seem add up in my book.

If I didn't know better, I'd swear this was a re-tooled ""The Howling (remember that movie?)""

Ultimately predicable.  No mystery here.

Don't get me wrong, I really like the cast - an excellent group.  Their efforts would have been better

spent in another endeavor.

What's next?  Goldilocks? (I hope not...)

Another time-honored fairy tail corrupted by Hollywood.

Frankly, I prefer the Warner Brother animated cartoon starring Bugs Bunny...but that's just me...

I rate Red Riding Hood...3 stars.",1299369600,2,616,5.22680412371134

4220534,2,B003Y5H54W,"I am not saying that this filmed sucked because it didn't but quite frankly it didn't get me going. The most exciting thing I can say about it is ""the cape was pretty"". So brilliant and crimson and flowing and against the snow and dark forest (which by the way ""rocked"").

Sadly though there was no real gut-wrenching suspense and no hard action. The scenes were almost impotent and ""so what"". I did however like the fact that it kept me guessing about the wolf. Who was it? The whole time I was thinking the mother or later the grandmother but then (oh this is all spoiler sh*t so don't read it.if that type stuff bothers you.) Then to find out who the wolf was just seemed so satisfying. It was the films only saving grace. Quiet frankly I would have love to seen more sexual tension and graphic violence. After all it is a werewolf film. Those b*tches are sloppy eaters, people! No they had to tone it down for the kiddies. This was basically a love story on a censored dime store wave of ""why the f*ck make this d*mn film if nothing real is gonna come from the experience""

I would have had better things to say about this film but I could not find much. Here is what I thought was great about the film. The actors did great jobs bringing these characters to life. The cinematography was epic and beautifully shot. The houses in the village made me actually want to go out into the deep dark forest and build a short stilted cottage to live in till the end of time. Oh and the two rival lovers of Red were both pleasing to the eye. Just too bad they didn't show the goods. That is all I am saying!",1438646400,,1601,4.245901639344262

4220807,1,B003Y5H54W,"I wanted to enjoy this movie, because I adore Amanda Seyfried, and Gary Oldham is also great, but not in this movie... The movie is dark, which would seem good, but the set is basically just a shadow, and a village that resembles the Alamo. Besides that, this village is more like a dorm room, filled with 17 and 18 year olds dressed up to look pretty, and stand in dramatic poses, while uttering very little of substance.. This is supposed to be a poor village, but everyone is beautifully dressed and looking like heartthrobs, not the bedraggled peasants they are supposed to be, which makes the whole thing seem utterly disingenuous. I had not realized, at the time I bought this, that this was by some of the Twilight people, but it makes sense when we see the heavy handed attempts to shove morality down our throats. The plot does not make much sense, except as clumsy allegory, and the presentation of said plot does not fit with the visuals (see my earlier comment).

I am sure 10 year old girls CAN be entertained by this, but it would be far better to expose those 10 year old girls to movies that more effectively teach them to think for themselves, than to be lectured about how evil old men are... I was barely able to finish this movie.",1416960000,4,1250,4.458515283842795

As always Gary Oldman sinks his teeth into his role and is far more interesting to watch than any other actor in the film, but the movie is at its best when Solomon and Valerie are on screen. The antagonist chemistry between the two made me wish there were more scenes with just the two of them and far fewer scenes of Valerie and her two dull suitors. If you're an Oldman or Seyfried fan this movie is for you.",1406073600,,653,4.495798319327731

4221031,4,B003Y5H54W,"As a purist of medieval history, I was prepared to be horrified by this film (and I don't mean in a good way), after seeing mixed reviews. I have to admit that the first 20 minutes or so was an adjustment, for that reason. The era is undefined (I laughed at the log cabins, the women constantly carrying baskets, fishing net hanging on the wall). I couldn't figure out whether it was just lazy filmmaking - lack of research. But then I realized it is intentional. The era is intentionally vague. Everything is vague, in order to lead you into a beautiful dreamland. And beautiful it is. The set is stunning. The acting is superb (check out that stellar cast list!).  The film is experimental, campy on purpose, and a blast.  Amanda Seyfried is breathtakingly beautiful, as always, and up to the script, as always. Gary Oldman is great, as is Julie Christie.  Lucas Haas nearly stole the show. And sexy up-and-comer Max Irons is terribly dashing in the role and swoonworthy - he played the part straight, with great earnestness, and has you believing every cell in his body is honorable and true.

I felt transported from beginning to end. I think that to assume it was trying to be a contemporary horror film, an adult film a la Twilight, or anything other than it is, is a mistake; it is intentionally simple as a story (with a neat twist), not because the filmmakers are catering to a pubescent audience, but because they wanted to retain the basic feel of a fairy tale, despite adult overtones in theme. As a piece of film art, it is brave and never less than interesting. The filmmakers understand the magic of a fairy tale at its core: the charm of the story is that the romance is sweet and simple, while the wolf is a symbol of terror; the juxtaposition is what creates the fairy tale flavor - it's what kept us listening wide-eyed as kids. I think this was a grand experiment. As a professional novelist, I appreciate innovation and daring, and I think that is what was present here.

Someone else commented that the adult themes were closer to the foundation of the original tale. I actually wrote a paper at university about the metaphorical meanings, historically speaking, in common fairy tales. People in earlier centuries looked for and more readily understood, metaphors in morality tales, while in the modern era we are conditioned to read things as literal. Red Riding Hood is traditionally a metaphor for the dangers of rape. Young girls wandering too far from home (the woods - where anything can be lurking, including men), encountering strangers. Disobedience, nonconformity, and independence in young women leading to disaster. It was originally intended as a warning tale. (""Red"" symbolizes lust, daring, independence, and evil, as well as blood.)",1405641600,7,2770,4.774530271398747

In fact, they all seem to stand in all of him not able to deliver a line worthy of his acting.

The saddest part of the film was their celebration after believing they had killed the Wolf. The director try to make it like a rave scene. Every actor looked silly. Stupid. He put some flaming poi-poi balls in there, which were poorly done. If he thought this would make the younger generations flock to this film, I fear he was wrong. My 25 year old daughter laughed.

4221222,5,B003Y5H54W,"I feel like this film didn't get the credit it was deserved - especially in the line of werewolf films. It takes the genre and gives it a nice hard twist. It isn't boggled down with senseless gore, but rather lightened with brilliant insight to lycanthropic lore and tradition, with nice spins and twists. The mystery element is also nice and it isn't one of those that is so easily figured out, either - it keeps you thinking until the end. I won't fill this with spoilers, but, as a fan (a mainly disappointed fan as of late) of werewolf films, this was a breath of welcomed icy fresh air! It's a must see - brilliant 'wolf portrayal and brilliant acting to boot. Very well done.",1392508800,,681,4.412698412698413

4221477,2,B003Y5H54W,"Inspired by a famous fairy tale, Catherine Hardwickes Red Riding Hood follows the story of Valerie (Amanda Seyfried), a young woman living in a medieval village haunted by a werewolf. An allusion to the tale of Little Red Riding Hood is, however, rendered pointless because of the uninteresting heroine and even more uninteresting (and confusing) story that goes on and on without knowing where it is going.

Valerie has a childhood friend Peter. Peter and Valerie love each other and decide to run away from the dull community they live in, when a tragic death happens. Hunting begins.

The film feels rushed. Things happen too quickly, without letting us know the characters. It seems filmmakers do not know what they are trying to make. As a horror or thriller, Red Riding Hood is not very thrilling; as a romance it is not very romantic.

Only Gary Oldman as Father Solmon determined to hunt down the werewolf seems to know what kind of film he is in. He refuses to take the film too seriously, as his almost over-the-top performance shows. Oldmans character and his story about his wife and two daughters is more interesting than the entire film, an empty retelling of a classic fairy tale.",1383609600,,1195,4.79126213592233

4221638,4,B003Y5H54W,"I am surprised. I thought this was going to be another cheesy romantic werewolf flick. But Red Riding Hood IS actually a good movie. Red Riding Hood is not just a fairy tale. The movie is surprisingly thrilling and actually suspenseful. Amanda Seyfried(who has very beautiful eyes) plays the title character Valerie. Supporting cast includes Gary Oldman, Billy Burke, Max Irons, and Virginia Madsen. The Supporting cast and Amanda Seyfried all did a good job. The Storyline is not quite like the story and honestly it really helps the movie. Its more of who is who rather than the ""My what large teeth you have'' lines and The End"". This movie goes really deep into the mythos, which makes it very enjoyable and great to watch.
Make no mistake, Red Riding Hood is not the best movie I have seen, but it is one of the better films adapted from a fairy tale that I have seen. So in short, Red Riding Hood gets:

Filled with fast action and you have to watch it very carefully.  Had some great effects too!  Amanda Seyfried is at her best in this one of a kind movie.  Yes, they sneak in the fairy tale portion but it is only a minute, if that.  Since it takes place during medieval times, makes me wonder if that fairy tale was told back then.
A wolf that terrorizes a small village and the people go after it, kill it, only to find others and cannot figure out where all these wolves are coming from and why they are attacking them.

If anything I didn't like it was the fact that nearly the whole movie takes place under the cover of darkness, even Twilight had scenes shot during the daytime, this a teenager type genre movie and it clearly shows from the audience it's appealing to as well as the movie being rated PG-13.

4221891,3,B003Y5H54W,"Make no mistake about it - the intended audience for this film is the younger teenaged crowd - though with themes that glorified promiscuity and betraying your parents for a boyfriend, I'm not entirely sure how well suited it would be for most adolescents. That aside, there were occasions when 'Red Riding Hood' did attempt to rise above the teen romance (or rather, lust) genre. Coming from someone who was both on the fence about watching it and unimpressed with the opening, I have to admit there were many redeeming qualities within. This was not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, and yet, it was not nearly so bad as some reviews here have suggested.

The Cons:

- Both male leads. I refer to them as Donnie Brasco and Elvis.

- The dialogue was sometimes fair, occasionally good, but usually corny. In one scene, Donnie Brasco steps up and says ""We can't give her to the wolf. That's human sacrifice."" Yes, thank you, Captian Obvious. But I really don't think 17th century villagers being picked off by a werewolf with a grudge did much stepping onto the 21st century politically correct soapbox. Instances such as that, and the classic referral to the other villagers ""judging"" her, made me feel like I was in high school again.

- The stupidities, such as running water flowing from a well in the dead of winter, and pretty boys/girls flouncing about with naked arms and collars open halfway to their naval in the same weather.

- The overall theme. While the ending was satisfying, it was also redundant. (!!!Minor Spoilers Ahoy!!!) Valerie kills one werewolf only to hook up with another. And who that first werewolf was makes me lament for the priorities of your average teenager.

The Pros:

- The mystery element, which was not overly obvious and did keep the viewer suspicious of everyone and constantly doubting their own conclusions.

- Very well paced. The storyline flowed, and every scene was important to the plot.

- It wasn't a traditional horror movie, but the stunning visuals, which were mostly not comprised of computer imagery, only contributed to the creepy atmosphere. It was eerie, and something of a light thriller/mystery with werewolf lore thrown in.

- The werewolf. After watching practically every werewolf movie under the sun, and ALWAYS being disappointed, this, in all honesty, was the lycanthrope I have been waiting all these years to see. I don't want to spoil it by giving too much away, but it was wolflike without too closely resembling a normal wolf, though not overdone with the CGI. It was actually frightening for its believability factor.

So, if you're like me and are constantly on the prowl for a good late night werewolf flick to sink your teeth into (apologies for the puns), this is certainly not great cinema, but was very entertaining and definitely worth a watch.",1360454400,10,2834,4.8347107438016526

The acting was decent, especially Julie Christie and Gary Oldman.  It is an escapist film best watched on a grey, rainy day.

4222009,3,B003Y5H54W,"When watching ""Red Riding Hood,"" the 2011 teen-angst horror fantasy, I couldn't help but remember those snow globes so popular around Christmas time. Shake it and a raging blizzard swirls around a miniature cabin. The isolated, Medieval community in ""Red Riding Hood"" is comprised of similar gingerbread homes covered by a stylish dusting of snow. Obviously an extraordinary set, domestic melodramas are accented by breath-taking helicopter shots of forbidding mountains due north of Vancouver. This is a world of daydream imagination, and director Catherine Hardwicke's long-time roots as a set designer on such films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanilla-Sky/dp/B000ICII5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanilla Sky</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tombstone/dp/B003SI84D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tombstone</a>&nbsp;are readily apparent.

There's a fine line one has to walk when forging such fantasy, and ""Red Riding Hood"" stumbles on the trail too often. It's clear this is a variation of rural Europe, the land of Germanic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grimm-s-Fairy-Tales/dp/1480270253/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grimm's Fairy Tales</a>&nbsp;(""Little Red Riding Hood"" also has roots in 17th century French folklore), and yet characters speak with San Fernando Valley accents. There's even a huge iron elephant used for torturous confessions, a peculiar device said in the film to be borrowed from ""The Romans."" Okay, but the Romans were an actual historic civilization. If Hardwicke is attempting to create a fantastic middle earth, perhaps one should not reference reality? The entire film suffers haphazard missteps, eroding the creative vision filmmakers were hoping to achieve.

The Little Red Riding Hood of this film is not so little. In fact, she's teenage beauty Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) bouncing between advances of a couple of hunks. Her heart belongs to Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), a woodcutter rebel who dresses in black. But she's been promised to Henry (Max Irons), a son of wealth whose father, I don't know, sells wood? The snow globe village, as isolated as Dracula's castle, suffers from monthly appearances of a werewolf on nights of the full moon. Villagers provide an animal sacrifice, usually an unlucky pig chained to a stump, so the canine menace avoids residents.

After years of uneasy co-existence, the werewolf unexpectedly kills Valerie's sister, and a warrior priest is invited to town to flush out the menace. Yes, this priest is played by Gary Oldman, a cloak-wearing variation of Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins, replete with bodyguards adorned in crossbows. Oldman has a grand time in one of the film's highlights, possessing all the subtlety of Vincent Price. Oh yes, suspicious residents are thrown into the already-mentioned elephant to garner werewolf confessions. There shall be no spoilers, suffice to say absolutely everyone is a suspect, including Valerie's mother (Virginia Madsen), father (Billy Burke), grandmother (Julie Christie) and the coifed hunks vying for her heart.

Oddly, I felt a sense of depression when watching Christie deliver ridiculous lines while baking cookies in her isolated cabin. There was a time when she was our greatest living actress, a mesmerizing talent in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Petulia/dp/B0070DY26I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Petulia</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McCabe-Mrs-Miller/dp/B003Y3U8OS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McCabe & Mrs. Miller</a>&nbsp;and ""Heaven Can Wait."" A remnant of an incredible golden age in film, she's now reduced to playing hippie grandma in a teen flick. Oh well, life's a long and winding road with unforeseen turns.

At one time, Hardwicke was a promising talent who burst upon the scene with insightful and courageous films detailing America's youth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thirteen/dp/B000I9VZHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thirteen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lords-of-Dogtown/dp/B000I9VXR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lords of Dogtown</a>). And then she directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001T5D6LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>, making saddle bags of money for all involved. ""Red Riding Hood,"" with teens in love, werewolves, spiked trees and a nice Goth tune here and there, is an attempt to recreate that box office success. I think America's bored youth will like it, but the story is plot heavy and obsessively derivative, with too busy elements barely held together by balls of twine. I can't imagine how anyone could keep from laughing.

There's some great shots of Valerie, with flowing red cape hiking along dangerous snowy mountain tops. I also loved the town's pagan festival where dancers tip-toed through fire while splashing mugs of beer, a raging celebration that would make  Lord Summerisle of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wicker-Man-1973/dp/B002QCD2OG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wicker Man (1973)</a>&nbsp;proud.

My big question is--along with probably most people who have sat through this-is what in the hell is with that big, freaking metal elephant?  Who came up with such an absurd idea in the first place?  And the whole werewolf bit?  It's just all so incredibly STUPID and worse, badly scripted.  This flick almost makes the whole Twilight movie thing seem good and that's just scary.  The director would have done well to sit down and study Snow White and the Huntsman to see how to take an old story and breath new life into it.

4222334,4,B003Y5H54W,"Amanda Seyfried is definitely one of the current ""IT"" girls of Hollywood; there's just something about her and those big, wide saucer eyes that's alluring and captivating.  She plays Valerie, a daughter of one of the local woodcutters, in a far off out-of-the-way village up in the mountains that is beset by some werewolf monster who is killing some nasty deeds.  And, as the film suggests early on, the werewolf might just be grandma!  But as the film unfolds both as a who-dun-it as well as a guess who the were-person really is thriller, we are allowed to uncover more and more clues and more and more potential persons become suspected of being the were-person.  Snaggly-toothed actor Gary Oldman is the impetus of this widening of suspicions as he comes to the sleepy village on the hunt for this sinister monster; he is perhaps all too familiar with it himself.  He certainly isn't all that he's cracked up to be...

And so the story goes until toward the end when we get copious amounts of on-screen werewolfage and wonder why it has such an intense interest in our heroine.  The actors may be playing their parts too earnestly or overintently at times but this isn't masquerading as some great theatrical moment.  Take it for what it is.  There are some twists and turns that play out well though we've been there and done that.

Valerie's fate is inexorably tied to the Werewolf in a way she never could have guessed. This makes her a suspect and the bait to trap the monster.

This is a pretty good gothic fairytale. The setting, costumes and atmosphere are excellent. It is more of a mystery movie than you would think by just hearing the title and reading a synopsis. At times it moves kinda slow, but delivers at the end. I do like that the ending isn't predictable. As I said before, this film moves a little slow.

This leads the townsfolk to bring in a BBW hunter, and ultimately uncover the mystery behind the person who changes at full moon.

The positives for this film mostly relate to non-acting aspects.  The set, prop, and costume design are stellar.  The cinematography is at times stunning, with sweeping, snowy landscapes and crystal-clear reflective lakes to entice viewers.  The story is a little lame, even if it is an update to a classic.

4222433,3,B003Y5H54W,"The movie opened with an absolutely stunning, establishing shot, taking us over mountains and forests; down into a remote village...........where we landed with a sad little thud.
We were hardly in that village a few minutes when things began to go awry.  Obviously, like a lot of movies, they blew their entire budget on art direction and the casting of Julie Christie (as elegant as ever), and that canned ham Gary Oldman.  Whatever was leftover was sparsely spread among lesser considerations.
This movie stopped working the moment the dialog started.  Scenes were abrupt, founding explanations were blurted in random fashion; emotions were either muted or overblown, not matching the sequences.  Everything felt out of sync and curiously detached from what they were trying to present.  It didn't help that the lead character Valerie (Amanda Seyfried), came across as a Changeling, someone not indicative of that village, that time period, the known universe.  For the longest time she was the odd one out, until the evil whatsit (Gary Oldman) showed up, stealing the position of the village anomaly.  His abbreviated pomp entrance and that bloviated speech about the difference between a wolf and a werewolf felt forced and out of place (he managed to produce a performance that was both overdone and half-baked; no small feat!).  And as it happened, he brought along the perfect visual aid to demonstrate just what went wrong with this movie.  He made a grand show of introducing a giant doodad in a box that was almost instantly dismissed.  Why impose an elaborate prop into a scene when the simple explanation that went with it was dispensed quickly, making the need for this ornate apparatus irrelevant and redundant.  This was the problem throughout; things didn't really mesh, just a lot of stray pieces slapped together and called a movie.  It was like watching all these cogs spinning recklessly, trying to gain purchase, but the opposing gaps wouldn't accept their teeth.  Everything was at cross-purposes.  In the end, while this movie was certainly lovely to behold, it was ultimately vacuous and not a little silly (I'm almost certain dirty dancing wasn't done in that century).",1347753600,,2195,5.094972067039106
4222483,4,B003Y5H54W,"If ever there was a film to be seen in the Blu-Ray format, its this one Director Christine Hardwicke's 'RED RIDING HOOD', a wonderful tribute to the original dark story line before the Brothers Grimm cleaned it up.  You have read all these reviews but its important to state that this alternate cut works much better than the theatrical one.  After Peter is bitten by the werewolf at the climax, the theatrical print cuts to Valerie and Peter burying the body in a nearby lake.  In the alternate cut, there is a nice erotic love scene between them and then comes the burial.  After Peter leaves the town, we hear Valerie's voice narration letting us know the time exposition of the town and characters and again the cuts differ.  In the original ending, we see Valerie exiting her grandmothers house in full red robe regalia stooping to pick flowers and looking up to see Peter in werewolf form gazing at her as she gives him a Mona Lisa like smile before it fades to the credits.  The alternate is much better, we see Valerie approach her grandmothers house and as she turns we see her carrying a baby which is obviously Peter's procured after the excised erotic romp on the red cape.  Peter in werewolf form appears and Valerie with child smiles back at him as the credits emerge.  Within the atmosphere and feel of the film, this cut works much better and obviously the test audience that voted on the other cut must have have been asleep most of the time. The werewolf scenes are very impressive even though they are CGI generated. The extras are also bountiful as Warner Bros. releases it in a nice 2.35 transfer with unbelievable sound and many featurettes including rehearsals and screen tests of the main actors.  Although critics were not very kind to it, the film deserves to be in every horror fans collection because its a great werewolf movie and Director Hardwicke who gave us the saccharine ridden 'TWILIGHT'-2009 has emerged as a filmmaker that should be watched in the years to come.",1347062400,,2000,4.659090909090909

No passion...no expressions...no change in tone of voice through the entire movie.

Not blaming her for the total failure of the movie, though.  There was so much to blame. The script was awful...deadly dull dialog, boring plot, very little suspense, hard to follow.  There were too many cliches especially the fact that the ""good guy"", the Priest, ended up being evil and killing more folks than the werewolf did. I get so tired of people who serve God being portrayed as evil. Boring!

I could hardly make it through to the end. The love story had no chemistry or draw at all...couldn't care less which boy she ended up with.

The film builds-up suspense as to the identity of the werewolf and I wasn't able to figure it out. But, once the explanation is given, it all makes sense. If you pay close attention you might be able to figure it out.

As my title blurb points out, this is a spectacularly good-looking film with awesome photography, locations, sets and actors. Wide-eyed Amanda Seyfried is perfect as the protagonist.

4222492,4,B003Y5H54W,"As soon as I saw the trailer to ""Red Riding Hood"" (2011) I wanted to see it. This is basically a werewolf mystery with elements of the children's tale. What sets it apart from other werewolf mysteries, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howling-V-The-Rebirth-VHS/dp/6301576152/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howling V - The Rebirth [VHS</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beast-Must-Die/dp/B0007VY558/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beast Must Die</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beast-of-Bray-Road/dp/B003ABZGQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beast of Bray Road</a>, is that ""Red Riding Hood"" is set in medieval Europe, possibly France near the border of Germany (the writer of the fairy tale, Charles Perrault, was a Frenchman).

Even people who don't like this film acknowledge the outstanding cinematography, locations, costumes and medieval sets (shot in British Columbia). But some grumble about it being a ""Twilight"" imitation or that the story's boring, etc. Although I'm sure the incredible success of the Twilight films contributed to the production of ""Red Riding Hood"" it's vastly different in tone simply by the fact that it takes place in 1300s Europe. As for the story being boring, it might not be the most compelling screenplay ever written but I was intrigued by the werewolf mystery and the film nicely created suspense concerning who might be the werewolf.

Speaking of which, there are no less than seven suspects and I wasn't able to correctly guess, even though I pinned it down to a possible three or four. When the werewolf is finally revealed and the explanation given it all made perfect sense and there are a handful of solid clues for sleuths. Excellent job on this front.

I was also impressed by a couple of original elements that ""Red Riding Hood"" brought to the table of werewolf lore. I can't share them here because I don't want to give anything away.

As far as cast goes, you have heavyweights like Gary Oldman and Julie Christie, as well as Billy Burke, Virginia Madsen and Amanda Seyfried. Amanda is great for the titular role with her big beautiful eyes.

There are a couple of quality Goth songs on the soundtrack, including ""The Wolf"" by Fever Ray, which makes the relatively long celebration sequence in the village a highlight.

FINAL WORD: More than anything else, ""Red Riding Hood"" struck me as a modern-day Hammer film. If you appreciate Hammer films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Curse-of-the-Werewolf/dp/B002RPR6TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Curse of the Werewolf</a>,"" as well as movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village-Widescreen-Vista-Series/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)</a>"" and the three mentioned above, don't miss out on ""Red Riding Hood.""

4222534,4,B003Y5H54W,"The first breathless moments of this re-imagining of the classic faerie tale throw you into a beautiful vista with haunting music. The sets and costumes are simply amazing, and the doe-eyed Amanda Seyfried is equally enchanting. Not all the actors fit well with these elements, mostly the lead males seem a bit awkward or forced. But it isn't enough to ruin the story. Gary Oldman again demands the viewer's attentions, as he always does, as a monster-slayer known as Father Solomon come to save Valerie's village from the Wolf. And the Red cloak almost seems as a character of its own - one wonders how many times it gets snagged during production...

The BD presentation gives us a veritable basket of goodies: an alternate ending, which I prefer over the theatrical; a pic-in-pic commentary (only for the theatrical cut, boo); a gag reel (where everyone except Seyfried gets their costumes to snag on something), additional scenes, two music videos, a very short composite of the Wolf in its various iterations of creation, and an even shorter version of the film - summed up in a mere 73 seconds.

There's enough here to mark the making of a truly remarkable film. For some I know, there was disappointment but I think such reviews are a bit more harsh than the film deserves. While not a frightening or creepy movie, it is a good film and a solid retelling of one of the most famous of faeries tales made for a new generation.

The casting is reasonable, although Billy Burke and Gary Oldman aren't given much to do and the supporting cast is a bit weak - but the love triangle in the center of the film works well enough.  The biggest problem is that the movie's plot feels like it needed a significantly bigger budget or more time in the editing room to make it more cohesive and flow better.

First 4 minutes.. Basically nothing was told and then.. 10 years later. Wonderful. Don't you think that was a little too fast to move from past to present?
Who put a wax into that guy's hair?
Too many black people serving as guards among white men at that time is just wrong.
With guards there was a storyteller. Did he forget ink somewhere? And he could pretend like he was writing a little better.
Even with this unnecessary love story it's still better than ''Twilight''.
Instead of the Riding Red Hood actress, they could use someone less known. I just simply dislike their choice, I dislike her. She isn't the right actress for that role.
Same goes for the guy with wax in the hair.
It's all right that story of the Red Riding Hood was twisted, and there was this father Solomon, but love out of the way. It was unnecessary. The movie could be so much better if something else took it's place. Show me an exciting story, not this: ''I love you, I love you not'' melodrama. I welcome any other remake or another twist on Red Riding Hood. Why? Because they could be just as bad or actually a good movie would be created.
''Don't you want me''? Ah, seriously? GTFO! Nowadays a good horror movie must include a sex scene or two. This movie is so cool, I've seen an almost a sex scene. Eh, no. Nothing new to see here. Waste of precious time that could be used on something else.
Hey there is this big bad wolf in front of you, woman. Show me some real fear. Forget that it's animated and put your fake strong will to somewhere else. Of course then it was predictable. Guards were near and then like in other movies the beast had to run away and the ''princess'' was saved. Eh, nothing new in here.

What I liked:
Atmosphere the movie gave away: was close to pleasant. I liked the set, falling snow and forest gave it a lot of beauty. The visual effects are beautiful.
Overall the movie was still good despite many things which I didn't like. I think I will watch it again. It's not as bad as it turned out to be.",1333756800,,2060,4.309278350515464

4222541,4,B003Y5H54W,"Fairy tales have captured our imaginations for generations. This reimagining of a classic fairy tale will appeal to older audiences but I would not recommend it to younger ones.

Everything about Valarie (Amanda Seyfried) has always set her apart from the rest of the villagers. Promised in marriage to the respectable Henry (Max Irons), her heart yearns instead for a local woodcutter, Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), who returns her affections and asks her to run away with him into the mountains. Their plans are thwarted when the bell is rung, signifying that a wolf has slain one of the villagers. For over twenty years they have lived in fear, bartering for their lives by sacrificing up their best livestock in exchange for the wolf not entering the village. But now Valarie's sister has been slain, devastating her parents (Billy Burke, Virginia Madsen) and Grandmother (Julie Christie). The men of the community are angry enough to go out and hunt down the beast, led by the resident blacksmith (Michael Shanks), but the village reverend pleads with them to await the arrival of a priest with experience in hunting wolves.

Rather than heed his advice, the men take up their swords and torches and go into the wilds. Disaster transpires as a result and confusion, suspicion, and betrayal enter the village at the arrival of Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), who informs them their legends are a lie. The wolf does not live in the distant mountains but among them, a human with the ability to transform....

Adapting a fairy tale for the big screen is tricky and many films have tried it, but few can find that delicate balance between the underlining romanticism and horror of the original. This succeeds, at least in the sense that it is both engaging and interesting. Visually, it is stunning, full of haunting woods and a soft, often warm color scheme (in spite of it being winter). The costuming is striking but never overwhelms the actors, all of whom are adequate and in some instances very good. Oldman in particular seems to be enjoying this role, and Christie is quite ominous as the strange and slightly sinister Grandmother. The romantic triangle is a tad contrived but most of the rest of the script is good, if not intentionally misleading as it takes us in different directions with the intention of obscuring who the werewolf really is. It does a masterful job and while some of the plot twists are predictable, I appreciated that the two young men vying for Valarie's attention avoid most of the usual stereotypes.

One cannot recommend this too easily because it does approach a fairy tale with a more mature, sensual outlook and at times the acting is painfully wooden, but I really enjoyed it. From beginning to end it was beautiful to look at and held my attention. It may not be for everyone but if you love fantasy and fairy tales stories as I do, if nothing else it will be a diverting way to spend a couple of hours.",1332892800,,2939,4.768172888015717
4222542,3,B003Y5H54W,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

This new take on the children's story wisely preserves the period (though not specified time) frame of the tale. The acting, from Ms. Seyfried down to Mr. Oldman, is very good. However, I think the story needed more development, not only to flesh out the relationship between Valerie and Lucie, Valerie's relationships with Peter, Henry & Claude, but also to further establish Roxanne's relationship with Claude (which I thought was given too little screen time). A minor annoyance: a song that sounds like rock plays during a scene. So basically, I think the movie needed more development, not only in the relationship aspect, but also showing how the people of Daggerhorn went about their daily lives and how the wolf came to be a terror to the village, and that it should have been longer, like 2/1/2 hours. There's also a nice homage to the original tale late in the film. The sensual scenes were really not neccessary, and it could have been easily implied rather than shown. Rated PG-13, but could have been rated PG.",1332892800,2,1071,4.789189189189189

I love the atmosphere of the movie. The small village has a very cozy, intimate feeling about it. I want to live there!  :)

This movie won't appeal to everyone by any means. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't pretend to be some pretentious, hoity toity film for movie snobs. It is what it is, and that's what I like about it.

So, regarding the movie. Personally I give it 5 stars because I like the atmosphere and I love the soundtrack.

Regarding the disc, I hate it. I give it 0 stars simply for the fact that every time you put the disc in and hit play, you are forced to watch the same movie trailer. (Yes - you can skip it, but even so, a disc I purchase should not force me to watch movie trailers. Think about it. I still have DVD's from 10+ years ago. I assume I will still have this blu-ray 5 to 10 years from now. I don't want to watch the same stupid movie trailer for the next 10 years!)

Even worse, blu-ray technology pretty much sucks. It's an utter failure in my opinion. (Streaming is the future.)

The biggest gripe I have with this disc (and others like it) is that you can't resume! If you need to turn the movie off and go do something (or go to bed), when you hit play the following day, the disc starts over at the beginning. (And yes - it plays the movie trailer all over again.)

I find this kind of thing completely infuriating. With all this advanced technology we have, you'd think that something as basic as remembering where I stopped the movie wouldn't be an issue. I'd be willing to bet the DVD doesn't have this kind of idiotic problem.",1332806400,,1828,4.217765042979942
4222573,5,B003Y5H54W,"This is a stylish horror story, a who-done-it mystery, and a young love romance combined.  Dark, gothic, and visually gorgeous in parts, it's an entertaining movie that carries you along and keeps you guessing.

Amanda Seyfried grows ever more beautiful in her movies, coming a long way from her dim-wit over-rouged Karen in ""Mean Girls"" in this leading role.

Shiloh Fernandez does a good job, looking very much like a younger, less crazy Joaquin Phoenix.  Max Irons (the son of Jeremy Irons) is another teen heart throb in the making.

Also interesting to see on screen again are Julie Christie and Virgina Madsen, screen beauties in their younger years, playing a hippie grandmother and philandering mother.

Lukas Haas, the little boy from ""Witness"" is in this movie, all growed up, as a naive Father Auguste.  He had a small part in ""Inception"" also.

Gary Oldman was great, as always, playing the role of Father Solomon.

The music adds to this movie, very new age and pretty.  I got the soundtrack afterwards.

It's not the usual movie treatment of the Middle Ages. I was glad they finally ditched the standard fake British accents and went with American accents for once.  After all, people didn't speak with either modern British or American accents in the Middle Ages.

Father Solomon's African and Asian soldiers add to the effect that this is very much a modern fantasy tale - like a graphic novel, a re-telling of ancient times as seen through a parallel universe.

All the negative reviews of this movie miss the fantasy and graphic novel style of this movie, miss the fact that this is not the usual gross-out teen horror movie, but very much a warm and gentle romance between two young and attractive leads.

I liked this movie a lot, enough to get the Blu-ray and DVD combo after renting it.

The Blu-ray has a good number of extras not in the DVD, including an alternate ending (shorter and more abrupt than the theatrical cut), a gag reel of bloopers, a few deleted scenes, and several ""making of"" shorts about the actors, music, and film making.

The best two extras for fans of this movie are the music video of the song ""Crystal Visions"" (shot as an extended version of the future love affair seen in glimpses at the end of the movie) and a Picture-in Picture commentary track with Director Catherine Hardwicke, Amanda Seyfried, Shiloh Fermandez, and Max Irons talking about the movie.  One brief exchange:

Amanda Seyfried: ""Do you ever think when you watch me, that it's quite possible for my eyeballs to fall out?""
Max Irons: ""Best question ever.""
Catherine Hardwicke: ""You do have pretty amazingly large eyes"".
Amanda Seyfried: ""Sometime it makes me want to just close them"".",1330819200,,2701,4.807359307359308

4222577,3,B003Y5H54W,"I'd love to say that in person to the beautiful Amanda Seyfried who has tremendous blue peepers. She plays the girl in the long red cape in this reimagining of the old children's fairy tale.

Seyfried always has the ability to improve the quality of whatever film she's in, and RED RIDING HOOD is no exception. This film draws so heavily on the TWILIGHT franchise that it might as well BE an installment of TWILIGHT, (""TWILIGHT: THE ANCIENT BEGINNING"") but despite the derivative nature of the film (with its teenage love triangle and werewolf), RED RIDING HOOD does shine with its own dark light.

Much of it is due to the set design and cinematography. Its fairy tale-cum nightmare universe is filled with a forest of trees spouting sharp spikes. The architecture of RED RIDING HOOD's village likewise is festooned with spikes. The village is in a remote valley surrounded by sharp-peaked mountains, somewhere, presumably in the Europe of the Dark Ages. It is winter, cold and dark. The villagers practice a kind of Christianity-tinged paganism. Belief in werewolves, witches and magic is universal. When a long-gone werewolf reappears, the villagers hunt it and kill A large wolf. The wolf-slaying brings on an orgiastic rite of drunkenness, lewd dancing, sex, and the immolation of a Burning Man figure.

In the midst of all this revelry, the mysterious Father Solomon appears (Gary Oldman in appropriately evil form) telling the villagers that what they have killed is merely a wolf and not a werewolf. A Fearless Werewolf Hunter, Fr. Solomon is also a zealot who killed his own wife for being a lycanthrope---a human able to assume the form of a wolf. Like most Inquisitors, he takes far too much enjoyment in torturing the villagers, one of which, he asserts, is the werewolf. What follows is a literal witch-hunt as the frightened villagers turn on each other to avoid Fr. Solomon's diabolical torture machines.

Enter Red Riding Hood. The pretty village girl, Valerie by name, was given her moniker because she wears a long red cape made for her by her kindly but eccentric Grandma (Julie Christie) who lives far outside the village walls. What isn't generally known is that Valerie can speak with the werewolf. When Fr. Solomon discovers this (through torture, of course) he sets Valerie out as a Judas Goat to lure the wolf who wants to claim Valerie for its own.

While there isn't much overt sexuality in RED RIDING HOOD, there is a tremendous amount of sexual symbolism. The blonde Seyfried is dressed in lavender with her red cape flowing behind her. Set against the whiteness of the snows, it suggests---practically screams---the end of innocence. ""Put on your harlot's robe!"" Fr. Solomon orders as he leaves her as bait for the werewolf.

Likewise, the lavender underdress is matched by Fr. Solomon's violet robes: They both share a secret knowledge. Even Seyfried's relationship to the werewolf is rife with sexual symbolism: the lycanthrope, whether as human or wolf, wants to possess her, not kill her.

Films often reflect the time in which they were made, and RED RIDING HOOD certainly does. The xenophobia of the villagers and their consuming fear are hallmarks of our own time. The obsession with innocence, purity, and values has become an increasingly intense---and frightening---element in our society, where we are revisiting issues as mundane as contraception.

In the end, though, it is Amanda Seyfried with her quiet talent, who manages, yet again, to imbue this film with more quality than it would otherwise have.",1329091200,2,3546,4.988155668358714
4222578,1,B003Y5H54W,"They really had the opportunity to do something creative with this tale. Instead they catered to the Twilight crowd...and not very well at that. The acting, aside from Gary Oldman's contribution, was seriously difficult to endure. The background music sounded cheaply edited and just cheap in general. The wolves could have been amazing but instead were only semi-interesting, staying pretty much shrouded in darkness throughout,  which hinted to me that shortcuts were being taken in their overall construction. I had high hopes for this movie but it turned out to be a sloggy endurance test with no reward.",1328659200,,608,5.204081632653061
4222579,5,B003Y5H54W,"This film is much closer to the 1984 movie ""Company of wolves"" (based on Angela Carter short stories) than to the original Charles Perrault tale - and like the former, it is definitely NOT for children. I am also almost certain that Catherine Hardwicke was at least a little inspired by the wonderful commercial for Chanel 5, made in 1999 and featuring Estella Warren as Red Riding Hood and the wolf as himself.

Both me and my wife we liked this movie very much. Ok, granted, this is not an immortal masterpiece, but we both spend a nice cinema moment and this movie has many qualities, which I will try to describe below. MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD.

First, we liked the cast. Amanda Seyfried is excellent as Valerie, a young girl who reached the time to be married and gets from her grandmother a red cape as wedding gift. The name Red Riding Hood is never used in the movie, everybody calls her just Valerie - but we of course know better... Amanda Seyfried wears this red cape with a great grace and the effect (especially for the male public) is quite pleasant. It is even more pronounced when the snow falls.

Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons give a good performance as two young village men, wild, bold and violent Peter and shy, peaceful and more sophisticated Henry, who both want to marry Valerie. Those two rivals and sworn enemies both have their good and bad points and with the time Valerie will have more and more trouble to choose between them.

Virginia Madsen plays Valerie's mother - her character, although secondary, is quite important for the plot so pay good attention to everything she says. Julie Christie is Valerie's grandmother, who lives in a house deep in the forest, away from the village - and she is (obviously) even more important to the story.

Michael Hogan (who is well remembered for his role in ""Battlestar Galactica"") plays village's reeve, a fearless no-nonsense man, who trusts his faithful silver dagger and is not afraid of the wolf.

Gary Oldman plays an inquisitor, Father Solomon, whose body and soul were once so terribly hurt by a werewolf, that he devoted his life to destroy those monsters. As usual for Gary Oldman's characters, Father Solomon is barking mad and definitely not a good person but he is clever and quite consequent and credible in his fanatism.

A special mention goes to Billy Burke, who plays the small role of Valerie's father, a burned out, heavily drinking wood cutter, used and worn out by the hardships of life and constant struggle with poverty.

And finally there are Shauna Kain, Carmen Lavigne and Kacey Rohl as Roxanne, Rose and Prudence, Valerie's best friends and young Cole Heppel, as Claude (Roxanne's brother), a retarded village boy. Those characters, although minor in the beginning of the movie, also have some important role to play.

The second very strong point of this movie is the scenography. The views of the mountains and the forest in this film are amazing. The village is extremely well designed, as are the costumes of the villagers and the soldiers who came with Father Solomon. This movie is visually very pleasant.

The third good point is the plot, which is not stupid at all. The main mystery is very skilfully kept until the end. And the ending itself is a very good one - especially for anybody who red Angela Carter's short stories about wolves, werewolves and Red Riding Hood.

The fourth good point is the Wolf, who has absolutely nothing to do with the cute and cuddly werewolves from Twilight saga. That Wolf came to our world from the darkest layers of hell and is as evil as it is powerful and cunning. And it has absolutely no heart, no remorse and no soul.

But the best thing in this movie is the general atmosphere, which is frequently quite erotic, when in the same time there is absolutely no sex and no nudity. Somehow, the simple presence of a flock of nubile girls and young men who court them and the always present menace of a half human Beast which enjoys preying on young females is enough to generate the very special mood of this Red Riding Hood. Amanda Seyfried, her blond hair and her red cape contrasting with the virginal white snow certainly contribute a lot to this atmosphere. However this movie is much more subtle than ""Company of wolves"", in which at one moment Red Riding Hood gets all naked and joins the wolf pack...

There are some violent moments in this film, but here also it is much less brutal than ""Company of wolves"".

So all in all I can't really give less than five stars, because I really spend a good moment watching ""Red Riding Hood"" and I will certainly look forward for the next Catherine Hardwicke movie.",1328572800,,4653,4.658536585365853

This film draws strongly from a wintry atmosphere, and the chills crawl as the snow gently falls and caresses the wilderness medieval setting. Gary Oldman puts in a great performance as a religious werewolf hunter of sorts. (Reminds me of Van Helsing). However, this movie rolls out with less action, but builds more on mystery and romance.

Pros

- Strong suspense. A werewolf is living within their midst.
- Good Cinematography. Nice selection of scenes.
- Nice costumes and set designs

Cons

- Gothic romance seems a little overdone. Love triangle lacks chemistry
- Storyline seems a bit nave when the villagers proceed to celebrate, in spite of being given substantial information that the werewolf is still alive. (seems to be a bit like Beowulf)

The story begins in a mountainous area in winter. A young girl carries a bucket down the lane to fetch a pail of water, but is distracted by a young boy. ""You do it."" Ten years pass. Peter's axe is taken away as a tease. A girl is promised to a rich man. What is the alternative? They hear the alarm - ""the wolf""! Her sister Lucy is the victim. [Note the black clotted blood.] Those hay stacks seem to be too close together. We hear about an arranged marriage. Can they hire a man to kill the wolf? A poor woodcutter wants to marry Valerie, but her mother has other plans. The villages decide to hunt down and kill the werewolf. [They wear no hats in the cold and possess no spears or other weapons.] Valerie is given a red riding hood by her grandmother. The men search in the dark using torches. They split up. There is a scream in the dark. Later the men kill a wolf, but have a casualty. Valerie learns a secret about life in a small village.

A coach with armed men arrive to kill the big bad wolf. The hunter tells about killing a werewolf; when dead it returns to its human form! The significance of a ""blood moon"" is explained to the villagers, and where the lair of the werewolf is! The villagers celebrate that night. [Is there a clue to the identity of the werewolf?] A conflict attracts attention. Later Valerie and Peter meet in private. The celebration is ended by the arrival of a big black wolf that attacks the villagers and gets away. ""I warned you!"" The wolf speaks to Valerie and asks her to go away with him. The morning light reveals more victims. ""Look for the signs."" Everyone's homes will be searched, the innocent have nothing to fear. [No Fourth Amendment.] There is danger from a live victim of the werewolf. Peter wants to leave the village with Valerie. Valerie's mother was clawed by the werewolf. Henry breaks their engagement. A boy is found in hiding, what does he know? Can they make him talk? Can his sister save him? Valerie is accused of being a witch. Does she know a name?

The people are told to go home. Can Valerie be saved? Will she be punished for her good looks? Can the witch escape? The big black wolf shows up again to kill and threaten the villagers. Another survivor of the attack is given his due. Later Valerie has a nightmare that involves a relative. The next morning the villagers go to hunt the werewolf. Valerie goes to visit her grandmother in the woods and finds a big surprise! ""Then it all made sense."" The mystery is revealed at last. ""It's a gift."" There is another surprise to end the story. ""I'm so sorry."" A man is given a proper burial. ""I'll wait for you."" The villagers still lived in fear. Valerie moved into the forest, she no longer feared a werewolf.

This is one example of what could have been a good movie damaged by a poor story. It is funny to have white stuff on the ground while people are not dressed for cold weather (no breath showing). It seems like a 45 minute story padded out to a full-length movie. You can compare it to the much better 1941 ""The Wolfman"". Some years ago I read an article on werewolves. Two professors researched the old legends and found they followed an outbreak of rabies. A man bitten by a rabid wolf turns into a rabid creature who attacks other people. They must be destroyed by a bullet to prevent their blood from infecting their slayers.creature who attacks other people.

4222649,4,B003Y5H54W,"The story is well known, and yes, while the director of this film is the same as the first TWILIGHT movie, and the atmosphere may be similar, the comparisons should stop at that point. I do not believe this is intended for the ""teen or 'tween"" set as described in the narrative about the film.  The love story is nowhere near the same as the Twilight series, and the werewolf does not sparkle, and is not attractive in its appearance as opposed to say, Taylor Lautner.  What this movie does do, is create a wonderful atmosphere, to tell a fabled fairytale with a devilish twist.  Oldman is superb; but so is Billy Burke as our damsel in distress' father. Burke gives a captivity performance, much the same as he does in all the Twilight movies...each time he is on the screen, he steals the scene.  Not to mention him in the general review is a travesty. The acting is well supported by the cast, and gives credible and believable performance in their rolls. The lead character, our damsel, could have gone the way of Bella in Twilight and just be annoying...she is not. She adds a depth and believability to the roll, and her love not just for her one true love, but also her affection becomes evident for her selected would be husband. Yes, Oldman is sinister, and he plays sinister all too well, but you even have pathos for his character as more about his past is revealed. Julie Christie gives a very memorable performance as the grandmother...you know ""what big teeth you have, etc.""  All the roles in this film could have been played over the top, and yet each actor stops short so that the film is believable and not a cliche. If only Hardwick had done the same with Twilight #1, perhaps it could have been truer to the book, and not filled with teen angst.  This is an outstanding horror movie, worth owning and watching.

4222692,4,B003Y5H54W,"Red Riding Hood is a pretty good horror flick with only a few things preventing it from being perfect.

Those who compare this film to the Twilight series are in fact correct- the overdramatic acting, the sense of mystery and fairy tale, and the presentation is spot-on 100% identical.

This film is basically what you THINK it's about in relation to the popular childrens book story. A big bad wolf occasionally (depending on the moon) comes out and kills people.

Alright so that's not exactly how the story book went, haha. But this IS a horror movie so some adjustments had to be made.

Red Riding Hood is a BEAUTIFUL young woman who is stuck in a tricky situation between which two guys she'd like to marry. Actually it's more like she prefers one guy, but the other guy is hand-picked and recommended by her family, so... you'll see what happens.

I LOVE how frightening the wolf looks in the movie. He attacks at lightning speed, he's extremely agile, he looks WAY more intimidating compared to a regular wolf, and even the storyline about how the villagers believed they killed the wolf only to be completely taken by surprise is another winning element to this great movie.

Speaking of surprises, it's up to you to guess who exactly is the big bad wolf. It turns out it's actually a person in disguise. I'm not patting myself on the back, but I had it figured out since the beginning based on a certain demeanor. That's all I'm saying so as not to spoil anything!

My only complaint is the ending. It's not bad, but the ending loses the horror aspect and focuses more on sentimental storytelling. You'll see what I mean. Not a bad way to conclude a pretty interesting storyline though, so I won't complain.

Overall, some would argue this isn't really a horror because it's only actually scary SOME of the time, and there's not really much in the way of atmosphere either (well... other than a few instances) but I don't know, it made me feel pretty terrified.",1324425600,,1970,4.6085714285714285

It exists on many levels: You have this enchanted village, with the lighting on Seyfried making her appear more an other-worldly delight from-a-fable than a normal young girl. Her sister found murdered by the wolf they all thought they had an understanding with, the Dagelhornians decide to kill the beast, raising all kinds of issues in the process. A special werewolf hunter (Gary Oldman), arrives to take control over everybody's life in order to kill the beast. Hero/deliverer quickly becomes tyrant-in-Dagelhorn amidst the love interest of the monied suitor vs. the true love of the woodsman for Amanda's hand. The fact that the ""wealthy"" suitor is a kind of blacksmith lends a touching morality tale: The bracelet he gives her is a simple tin-looking trinket, yet it is admired as something the poorer woodsman admits, ""I could never give you anything like that."" I thought it was an interesting take on 'marrying-for-money' theme when in Dagelhorn money doesn't get u very much aside from some ego-juice. Also, contrary to template, the monied suitor is actually an OK guy himself. The suspense starts when we - along with the Dagelhornians - and can they party! - have to understand the werewolf returns to his human form after he emerges in GREAT SPECIAL FX - so he cud be anyone. This is a fascinating turn, because we are subjected to constant hints and clues, along with outrageous camera ""plots"" in which the camera shows us Point-of-Views indicating the actions of certain characters; not all having ultimate relevance. So the viewer gets to play detective, keeping some clues, throwing out others. Keeping in mind this is a FABLE that is playing out themes of Loyalty, Love, Commitment, Fear, and also LOGIC. So you have to balance Logic with the obvious ""suspension of disbelief"" that plays mightily in werewolf-fables. How Amanda-as-Witch winds up solving the whole werewolf issue is pretty creative, and at the end I'm left wondering if a sequel wouldn't be fun with Seyfriend getting a little Wolfie herself. :)",1321747200,2,2180,4.9427792915531334

I originally bought this for my teenage daughter, but I liked it too.",1318982400,,381,4.305555555555555
4222748,3,B003Y5H54W,"Red Riding Hood is a sort of reimagining of the old Little Red Riding Hood fairytale, however the story stray so much from the original story that this can not be called a fairytale movie. The story revolves around a young woman named Valerie who is in a love triangle having to choose between the blacksmith her parents want her to marry and the man she loves Peter. Now as it would have it Valerie's village have been plagued to a werewolf for generations, when the beast finally kill a young girl in the village, Valerie's sister, people have had enough and call in a Inquisitor like monster hunter to slay the beast.

Now good things about this movie is the beautiful visuals, allot of details have been put into the characters and the costumes. The locations are breathtaking and even the computer graphics werewolf looks ok. Other good things about this movie are the characters, they are actually likable, the main character is a typical maiden in distress, but she is the kind of person you want to see rescued, both the love interests are decent, even the villain is interesting. Yes these characters are cookie cutter but at least the cookies have been given some nice paint.

The bad things about this movie is that is is a jumble, it can not decide if it want to be a fantasy film, a dark witch hunter tale or a romance film and it juggle those three aspects very poorly so that we have a start which is almost completely romance and then we have  a full on Inquisition film and then we have fantasy and so on, as a result it feels like the director could not decide what sort of movie she wanted to make and we end up with a sort of Frankenstein mix of a film which feels very confusing. This movie is also quite bland, you will see allot of pretty teenagers staring deeply into the darkness lamenting their love life, which get boring after a while.

Many people do not want to give this movie a chance. They see that the same people worked on this as on Twilight and they assume it is the same movie, just set in the middle ages. Now to be fair this is a teenage romance with supernatural elements, if you are looking for a horror movie you will not find it here, the relationships between the characters are more important here than the monster, and in fact you do not see the werewolf on screen that often, this can be seen as a good thing though as this movie is more about the paranoia over who the werewolf is and whatever or not love can survive such paranoia than it is a monster movie. That being said, while there are some similarities this is not dark ages Twilight. If romance is not for you at all then off course you will not like this movie, but if you like a bit of paranormal romance then this might be just up your alley.

I enjoyed Red Riding Hood, the movie kept my attention all though the runtime. This is however a flawed movie, it have some issues and is not for everyone, but if the supernatural, love affairs and maidens in pretty dresses in distress are your thing then I do recommend this movie, at least give it a rent to give it a chance.",1318291200,2,3082,4.334488734835356
4222749,2,B003Y5H54W,Red Riding Hood starring Amanda Seyfried just left me bored and confused. It's hard to believe that this film is produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Catherine Hardwicke. I found no redeeming quality about this movie. Seyfried is a beautiful girl but this is definitely her worst peformance by far! She is so wooden as the title character and Gary Oldman just overdoes it.

I happen to like peoples different takes on tales and myths, because that's what they are and you can make of them what you will. It is always nice to get another version or people get bored with the old ones. We all have our versions of what we think a werewolf, witch, god, vampire, or monster should be and act, but if it does not come to old standards it is shunned, however old standards are just that..old, something new and entertaining is not always bad and should be at least given its props for effort.

This was good, as the movie itself would not have generated the fan feedback to drive large ticket sales.  The movie delivers what the trailer portrays.  There is the girl caught between two guys.  There is the werewolf hunter, and a grandmother with some talent, along with various other village women whose morals span from good to bad.

4222811,2,B003Y5H54W,"Hmm... this movie was really quite awful... yet, as a total, unabashed paranormal romance junkie, I found myself a little bit... fascinated as it went on. And I think I know why: I have never seen a movie get SOOOO much RIGHT, all to wind up sabotaging the good stuff with what it got so very, VERY wrong. I wound up so detached, I felt like a true, objective movie critic. I didn't really FEEL anything, but I was able to analyze it as an artist, an entertainer and a writer. Almost like stepping outside of yourself and watching a movie through another person's eyes.

I think if you just LOVE dark paranormal romance - can't get enough of it, and are highly addicted to the genre - you may like this enough to be satisfied like a junk food junkie regretting your latest Cheetos binge. I personally was not satisfied even to that degree... but for what it's worth, here's what I noted to be right, wrong and somewhere in-between:

-The historical setting was a nice change of scenery for a YA paranormal romance, but ruined by everyone speaking in too contemporary a fashion.

-The heroine was strong in theory, but I barely even remember what she looked like. And by the way, did the name Valerie even exist in medieval-ish times? Not bloody likely.

-Billy Burke, aka ""Charlie"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Saga/dp/B001UV4XFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Saga</a>&nbsp;is a terrific actor, but his character was written so... so... silly. As a matter of fact, this cast was quite impressive: you've got Gary Oldman, Julie Christie, Virginia Madsen... and not a one of them could do a damn thing to make their characters remotely sane or likable. They were all just so... goofy... and not in a fun way. Just... over the top and bizarre and unsympathetic.

The one thing about this movie that had no redeeming qualities whatsoever was the horrific music [soundtrack and score]. ""They"" were trying to go for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plunkett-Macleane/dp/6305746605/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plunkett & Macleane</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Knight-s-Tale/dp/B00000F4ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Knight's Tale</a>&nbsp;aesthetic: contemporary music in a historical setting. Perfectly done in those two movies. In this? It just felt like I was constantly being shouted at, or like my head was shoved into a huge, metal mixing bowl while the animal-costumed villagers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wicker-Man/dp/B00005KHJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wicker Man</a>&nbsp;merrily gong-banged it with meat mallets.

The only true ""win"" in this movie was actor Shiloh Fernandez as ""Peter."" [Yes, like the fable, ""Peter and the Wolf."" Hint or red herring? Such clever writers, eh? Tee-hee!] I fell in love with this actor in the epic mind-frak of an indie zombie film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadgirl/dp/B002EOVXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadgirl</a>. [Which, by the way, I do NOT recommend at ALL for horror movie light-weights]. Shiloh is like a mix of Joaquin Phoenix [pre-crazy] and Johnny Depp. Need I say more? I just hope this movie hasn't ruined his career!

Finally, ""The Hood"" did deliver at least a few of the trailer's promises: the cinematography, costumes, locations and sets were almost as drool-worthy as the dark hero. Unfortunately, all the physical beauty in the world could not save this beast. Had&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Riding-Hood/dp/B003Y5H556/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Riding Hood</a>&nbsp;been YA-soap-opera-campy, I would at least have had a little fun.

4222870,3,B003Y5H54W,"I didn't know what to expect from this film. I'd read so many bad reviews before seeing it that I knew it couldn't live up to the bad press. I knew that it was directed by Catherine Hardwicke who made the first TWILIGHT movie, a film my wife loves and I find okay. This would be her first film since and her chance to show that her contributions were part of what made that film such a hit. Unfortunately I think it was more of a hit due to the popularity of the books and the hormones of young girls and older women who long for romance that made the film popular.

The film takes place in a small medieval village in Europe. Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) is the second daughter of woodcutter Cesaire (Billy Burke) and his wife Suzette (Virginia Madsen). Even though she is the second child, she has been betrothed to Henry (Max Irons), the son of the village blacksmith. Unfortunately for her she's in love with Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), an orphaned young man she's known since childhood who is a woodcutter like her father. But her mother wants her to marry up so Henry it is.

Problems begin when Valerie's sister is killed by a werewolf. The town is in an uproar and sets out to take matters into their own hands. They've fed the wolf for years with the best of their flocks and now the truce has been broken. While Father Auguste (Lukas Haas) sends word to the church to send help, the rest of the men head to the caves.

Henry's father is killed by the werewolf but they still find their prey. Taking home the head of the wolf, they plan a big party to celebrate. But beforehand help arrives in the form of Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), a famous werewolf hunter whose own wife was killed by one of the beasts. Father Solomon advises them to refrain from the celebration since he claims the head on a stick is that of a wolf and not the werewolf. Of course they ignore him and sure as the full moon rises, the werewolf strikes.

Warned that a bite from the werewolf during the blood moon will result in someone becoming a werewolf themselves, when one of Solomon's men is bitten Solomon must kill him in front of his brother. Is it just me or is this pretty obvious set up for something to come down the line?

The hunt for the werewolf continues through the film and the list of suspects range from both of the young men Valerie is in love with to quite possibly her grandmother (Julie Christie). When all is finally revealed it is somewhat of a surprise but not a great revelation based on clues we saw earlier. Instead it's just tah dah, here is who the werewolf is and why and why the werewolf has done what it has done.

The film looks pretty, I'll give it that, but there are just a few things that feel wrong about it. The first thing I noticed is that the costumes seemed more in line with an Uwe Boll film than a realistic depiction. Everyone seemed to be wearing new clean clothes. Kind of odd for a small village. Unless the village is named Fruit de Loom. The whole set up of the romance reeked of the TWILIGHT experience with two young men in love with the same woman and vying for her hand. When you toss in the term werewolf and it feels even more like that film.

As with another film I wrote about this week, THE LINCOLN LAWYER, this film isn't quite terrible. It is a pleasant diversion from everyday life but it isn't a great movie and won't be one that I feel most people will want to watch again and again. It's just light entertainment that some will enjoy and others will tolerate. Horror fans will just be disappointed. But if you're looking for something to pass the time, this one isn't all that bad.",1313366400,,3628,4.3343151693667155

4222952,3,B003Y5H54W,"The trailer tries really hard to make this look like Twilight meets Little Red Riding Hood. They crammed every romantic scene into the preview. It's quite misleading, and not at all what I was hoping for. I'm glad I didn't see this prior to watching, or I wouldn't have rented it. It wasn't great, but it certainly wasn't as lame as the preview.

While beautiful to look at, the script is lackluster at best. The story attempts to squeeze in much of the original, famous, Brother's Grimm version of the tale, but it just doesn't gel with the added plot concerning romance, family secrets, witches and werewolves.

Amanda Seyfried makes the best of a dull role, but Gary Oldman's over-the-top performance ruins every scene in which he appears - which, unfortunately, takes up more than half of the film. If I weren't a sucker for dark fairy tales, I would give this film a paltry two star rating. Alas, I did find some enjoyment in the story's mysterious elements, and the cinematography was breathtaking at times.

I think girly tweens are most likely the best audience for this film, and considering the lack of profanity, the comparatively non-gruesome violence, and no nudity make out session, this is a film adults can let the well-adjusted, modern, twelve and up set watch with nary a worry.

The comparisons to the Twilight franchise are silly. Valerie (Little Red Riding Hood) shows common sense when it comes to boys and the dangers they may represent, and is willing to sacrifice herself in order to protect her family and friends, quite unlike Bella and her sparkly, stalker, vampire boyfriend. Red Riding Hood is hardly a feminist statement piece, but it is refreshing to watch a fantasy film, aimed at tweens, whose leading lady doesn't discard her moral compass once a cute boy shows up.

Other than the visual aspect, I can also say (on a positive note) that the movie was obviously geared toward a younger crowd and other than a few make out scenes with some physical contact, the movie seemed suitable as far as gore and fear factor.

People, in whatever time period the movie is based in, would not look so clean, neat or done up. There is no grittiness to the film -it looked like they were on sets thru the whole movie -very poor filming.

The dialogue: well I can't write what I would really say because Amazon would kick it back, but the dialogue in this movie is cheesy with a capital ""C"". There is no point, no menace, no heart, no pulling you in.

The language is modern English set in this time period -beyond retarded, with no accents (except Oldman's). It's like they're all speaking in perfect modern English, too clean, wearing nice clothes while 'fearing' a werewolf"" -oooooh, yaaawwn... Even bad accents would have been preferable.

The acting is atrocious -hands down. The word ""wooden"" is given an unjust definition when describing the acting in this movie. You know those awful movies that are on the SyFy channel? They have better acting than this piece of trash. This movie, pardon the awkward comparison, is like porn for teenage girls -hence the ""Twilight"" comparison (which I've never seen but have a younger sister who has). I half expected them to whip out an iphone & start texting or check their Facebook page, while waiting for their speaking part during the many pointless conversations.

There is nothing redeeming about this movie other than Amanda Seyfried looks cute while she's not doing anything. An utter waste of time and money -luckily I rented it so I only wasted a few bucks. If you buy this, you're dedicated (or a teenage girl)! Catherine Hardwicke, who is the director, should be ashamed of making such tripe...

4222957,4,B003Y5H54W,"This movie is targeted more towards young adults. You can tell by the modern-day language and the Twilight-esque cinematography, but that is probably due mostly to the fact that the films have the same director. I think the characters should have had accents or at the very least they should've spoken proper English, but, again, tweens were the main target for this flick. They probably won't care much about those kinds of little details with sexy Peter and Henry vying for Valerie's affections. Sex-crazed teeny boppers drool over a good, hot love triangle, but I have to admit that I certainly enjoy that, too. Aside from the steamy stuff, I did like the mystery of the wolf. I thought I had him/her figured out, but my guesses were incorrect. That made me happy, because I am tired of predictable movies these days. Hollywood needs more original ideas. This movie is far from being totally original, but I appreciate its good twist on a classic.

On another note, I love Gary Oldman, and I think he is always a great addition to any film no matter what role he plays. He does quirky, weird characters very well. I think his part as the priest was extinguished a little quickly, and I was hoping to see him through to the end (even though he was kind of a bad guy). So that was a little disappointing.

In this version she lives in a village that's been plagued by a wolf for a couple generations.  The look of the town is rather pleasant even though it look completely fake.

It's rare to find a movie these days that has no dialogue at all, and by that I mean not a single word is spoken that is not necessary to push the plot painfully along.  Now I know a lot of people will disagree with my view on this movie and that's fine.

4223112,2,B003Y5H54W,"When your entire plot hinges on a single instance that happened in the midst of a forest a decade ago, and may or may not have been witnessed by the person who needs to have seen it, you should really rethink your story. Too bad the makers of ""Red Riding Hood"" didn't think of that.
A werewolf take on the fairytale has the potential to be very interesting. As it was, the central mystery in this film was executed well, and was intriguing. Unfortunately, the characters were rigid and lifeless; the romantic conflict was tepid and forced; and the story segments were obvious and uninspired. Far too often, this film felt like a brief overview of character-types or personality types rather than people; we didn't get to know the people, we only saw that they behaved, rather unconvincingly, in some way. This was true for most characters - including the two male love interests, both of whom came across as fill-ins for character types rather than actual characters - as well as most of the human interactions. What we saw of Red Riding Hood and Peter's romance seemed an effort to convince us by how cutsie they were that they were in love. Character development, too, followed in this vein of showing rather than becoming. The boys pouted; Red Riding Hood's eyes widened; the witch hunter glared; etc. Perhaps the best actors were the supporting actors, the villagers and the witch hunter's companions, who seemed to be rather than just pretend to be who they were.
Factor in that the mysterious identity hinges on (spoiler) someone witnessing the death of a rabbit a decade ago (end spoiler), and we really reach the final nail in the coffin of this film's potential. There's a lot of could have, should have, possibly would have about this movie...unfortunately, there is little right that was done with the film.

There is a little layering of the story as there may have been another secret romance.

Seems that our hooded heroine can communicate with the wolf which does not bode well of her future.
Will she go quietly or be eaten herself. Could be we are in for a big surprise.

The movie was not brilliant but watchable. There was a wolf, a riding hood, and big teeth. There are a few scuffed and missing body parts as part of the story; however no excessive gore.

Catherine Hardwicke (who directed ""Twlight"") puts a new spin of the classic fairy tale of Red Riding Hood. In a remote village named Daggerhorn there is a deal between the villagers and a werewolf, present a sacrifice and they are spared. Now after so many years the wolf has broken this truce by killing the older sister of Valerie (Amanda Seyfried, ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Jennifer's Body""). Her mother (Virginia Madsen ""Sideways"") has set her up to be wed to a man of wealth but Valerie loves another. After a group attempts to hunt down the beast, a hunter (Gary Oldman, ""The Fifth Element"") warns everyone the beast is someone in the village and that it takes human form. As the body count rises it becomes obvious that the wolf wants Valerie who seems to have an odd connection with the beast, and it will kill to get her.

The movie is a very different take on the Red Riding Hood story, it has a cool setting, the acting is decent by some and passable by everyone else. It is kinda obvious who the wolf is from early on and especially when Valerie comes face to face with the it, its even more blatantly obvious. This doesn't take away from the movie being entertaining and cool visually, but its just very predictable which is a notch against it. That aside it is worth watching, some will love it, some will hate it, and more will find it like I found it. Like the headline says, ""Its unique but flawed, but it does have good parts and they outweigh the bad."" **1/2 out of 4 stars.",1310947200,2,1503,4.442028985507246

She has seemingly carefree childhood and adulthood until one day her own sister is killed by a wolf.  The entire village is outraged and the hunt begins where everyone is a suspect about being a warewolf.

This is a typical movie geared towards teenagers and young adults.  There is a love plot (or better yet a love triangle), a priest (fantastic Gary Oldman) determined to hunt down the beast that affected his personal life and typical baccanalian celebration so loved by people who lived in the middle ages.  There is a subtle exploration of young love, sexuality, incest and parental control.

I loved the scenes with pictures of nature and forest.  And the girl in a red riding hood of bright red color definitely fits well into this story.  I enjoyed the storytelling and the movie, but I also found it to be not too memorable.",1310515200,,973,4.643274853801169

1. Leading character has red cape (and a basket)
2. There's a wolf
3. There's a woodcutter
4. There are woods
5. There's a Grandmother who lives in the woods.

Closer to ""The Village"" by M. Night Shyamalan than the ""Twilight"" movies, and without the plot twists, the movie focuses more on love triangles and Amanda Seyfried's face - ""My, what big eyes you have!""

In a nutshell:

1. Girl loves boy, boy loves girl
2. Girl is promised to another boy with rich family
3. Elopement plans are made
4. Wolf spoils plans
5. Wild wolf-hunt ensues where everyone is a suspect
6. Wolf shows true colours
7. Girl loves boy, boy loves girl

While the female characters are solid and well cast, the men disappoint big time. Gary Oldman tanks as a theatrically hammy witch hunter with weird fingernails and burly bodyguards, and when your leading men look wimpy compared to Robert Pattinson's ""Edward"" and Taylor Lautner's ""Jacob"" you should know you have a problem.

Dramatic lighting, costumes and settings lend to the supposed ""horror"" theme, but the true horror is that the movie just doesn't work.

RRH is not the worst movie you will ever see.  The village our heroine lives in is indeed fairytale-like, albeit somewhat weird in its construction.  There werewolf itself is pretty fierce, but regrettably only appears a couple of times in the movie, as anymore would probably spoil the not-so-big reveal at the end of the film.  It is a shame the director/writer didn't dwell more on the actual mythology of the werewolf as some really interesting and tense moments could have been mined.

The trailers looked intriguing and I thought the retelling of Little Red Riding Hood might lead to a good plot. Unfortunately, I found the tale to be below average. The accusations that this is simply another Twilight movie I cannot substantiate. I have never seen the Twilight movies although I have been told about thenm. From what I've heard they took liberties with the vampire myth that does not necessarily happen in Red Riding Hood. However, if you are expecting Howling type transformations--forget about it. There are no special-effect scnes like that, in fact, the werewolf simply looks lik, well--e a wolf.

I was surprised that Gary Oldman took this role. I would also like to know how much they paid him to do so. He has had far better roles than this that I can't believe he lowered himself to do such a sub-par film. His talents so go beyond a film like this. The sets have a Tim Burton look to them, but not quite as over-the-top. The actors are fair, but then again this wasn't meant to be a drama but a thriller, although, I was never really ""thrilled."" There is a sub-plot which misleads you as to who the werewolf really is, Unfortunately, by the time we find out, we don't care anymore than you really care about how the movie ends.

Be that as it may, it is probably worth a watch, but don't expect any surprises. They had an opportunity to do something really good with this but the writing simply falls short. This could have been a dark, brooding, even haunting film that could have made you jump out of your skin, but it is little more than eye candy and I only say that because of the sets.

There would be a lot less divorce and cheating if people were more loyal in this country.

4223832,4,B003Y5H54W,"The youngster Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) lives in the edge of a dark forest in the small village of Daggerhorn. Valerie uses to break the rules and is in love with the lumberjack Peter (Shiloh Fernandez); however, her mother Suzette (Virginia Madsen) has promised her to the wealthy Henry Lazar (Max Irons).

The villagers have a pact with the wolves, offering pigs and other animals to them in the full moons. When Valerie's older sister Lucie (Alexandria Maillot), who has a crush on Henry, is slaughtered by a wolf, the villagers decide to chase the animal in its lair. However, Henry's father is killed by the wolf, but the animal is murdered and decapitated by The Reeve (Michael Hogan). But when the werewolf hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) arrives in the village, he advises that the werewolf is one of the locals. Now the dwellers have to face another threat.

""Red Riding Hood"" is a combination of Little Red Riding Hood and The Crucible and the result is uneven, with good and bad points, but anyway this film is underrated on Amazon. The best this film can offer is certainly the wonderful cinematography. The story and screenplay open the possibility of suspecting of several villagers of being the werewolf but the real one. The poor side is the acting of the histrionic Gary Oldman; the wooden Shiloh Fernandez; and Amanda Seyfried that keeps the same expression of the face along the film. But the film is not as bad as the critics write.

4223934,5,B003Y5H54W,"I must admit I wasn't expecting much from this retelling of the classic fairy tale.  After all, its director is Catherine Hardwicke, she of the TWILIGHT atrocity.  And it surely will only appeal to lovestruck teenage girls.
Lo and behold, RED RIDING HOOD is a sumptuous well crafted mystery with gorgeous settings and camera work.  It's surprisingly good and far superior to the TWILIGHT franchise.
Wisely eschewing ""LITTLE"" in its title, the movie throws several red herrings in revealing the werewolf's identity.....and I didn't see it coming.
Hardwick also avoids the expected gimmicky transformation and gives us instead a huge vicious wolf.  She also manages to use the classic WHAT BIG -----lines in clever fashion.  The wintry landscape is beautiful in showcasing the vividness of the cape and in framing Grandma's deceptively inviting cottage.
Amanda Seyfried is good as the innocent Valerie and Shiloh Fernandez/Max Irons suitable as her suitors.  But its the seasoned vets who steal the movie.  Oscar winner Julie Christie still radiantly beautiful as Grandma; Oscar nominees Gary Oldman's eccentric werewolf hunter and Virginia Madsen's lusty mother of our heroine; and underrated Billy Burke as the tortured father.

4223994,4,B003Y5H54W,"Perhaps my experience with this film benefited from low expectations. After having seen reviews that clustered somewhere between ""eh"" and ""so-so,"" I was surprised to find myself enjoying it. It may even be a rare movie that works better on a home screen than in the theater. (It was released opposite ""Battle: Los Angeles"" which is definitely a big screen movie.) ""Red Riding Hood"" is no blockbuster, but if you're a person who unapologetically enjoys the sort of movie typically shown on the Syfy or Chiller channels, you'll probably like this, too - and the production values are 10 times better than the usual stuff there. Amanda Seyfried is as good a pick for the title part as is possible, and the rest of the casting is solid, too.

As for the central werewolf mystery, I've heard a few complaints (boasts?) to the effect of ""I saw it coming."" Well, I didn't exactly. To be sure, it's a logical suspect, but only one of a bunch. It's supposed to be a logical suspect. Fans of mysteries consider it cheating when an author offers no proper clues (amid red herrings); they hate it when, in the final chapter, the killer turns out to be some obscure person with no previously disclosed motive. The film works fine on this level.

All in all, this is a moody and interesting take on an old tale of a young woman and a big bad wolf.",1308528000,,1333,4.526970954356846
4223995,3,B003Y5H54W,"First things first.  I must address some accusations regarding this film that I just don't understand. What's with the comparisons to Twilight?  I found this film to have nothing in common with any of the Twilight films, and yes I've actually seen, well mostly, the Twilight films.  The only two things I could find was the romantic male lead had similar Edward-gel hair, and the director is Catherine Hardwicke(lest we forget she also directed the great films 13 and Lords of Dogtown) the director of the first Twilight film.  Yeah, otherwise, there's no real love triangle, no vampires, not set in modern times, it's got more of a horror movie and fairy tale vibe, and the focus on the story isn't the romance.  The romance is a side story to the impending doom and family dramas that surround Amanda Seyfried's character.  It's not there guys.  I know you think you're being clever, but you're not.  Secondly, there are a ton of comparisons to Neil Jordan's film In The Company of Wolves. Again, not really much in common.  Jordan's film was more surreal and visceral and had no real narrative.  It also only had one segment out of three that focused on the latter part of the classic Red Riding Hood fairy tale.  The both reference the fairy tale, but that's about it.  They're not similar in tone, story or style.  Again, by saying these things doesn't make you clever.....sorry.

Okay, this movie has one major problem as far as what it merits.  It misses a great chance to update a fairy tale and make the original story's themes more modern or switch them.  It could've easily been about virgining sexuality and rebellion.  Instead we get no themes.  This is a straight whodunit with a werewolf in the center.  That's it.  No deep themes.  No real point beyond lite fluffy entertainment.  This is a real bummer.  I just keep asking myself, ""why is this thing called Red Riding Hood""?  It references elements of the story, but that's it.  It's a completely different story.  It borrows from well known versions of the story and little known ones, but it only gives them lip service and doesn't really make them modern or relevant to a new generation.  It has no spin on the meaning of the story.  Why bother make this movie, why bother call it Red Riding Hood?  Like the review title states, a real missed opportunity.

Now I'm not narrow minded, so I'm aware that this would be boring and simplistic to be a straight retelling of the fairy tale.  Which version would you pick?  The version where Red Riding Hood takes out the wolf herself, showing she can take care of herself, or the one where she is saved by a heroic woodsman giving her a second chance and allowing her to atone for her willful 'female' ways?  Yeah, this story was an aural experience and was only written down later.  Sorry folks, Brothers Grimm didn't event these stories, just like the monks weren't the real authors of Beowulf.  You can tell it anyway you want.  But this story doesn't tell it any way.  It's about an un-named village in an un-named universe that has made a peace treaty with a werewolf.  One day Amanda Seyfried's sister is murdered and the hunt is on for the werewolf.  Seyfriend is being married off to the local rich kid, who she doesn't love or care about, but she is in love with a logger who is dashing but as about as wooden as the trees he chops.  A local Holy man calls in Gary Oldman, expert in the occult-killing werewolves and witches, to slay the beast.  We get scenes of the wrong beast killed. Werewolf attacks.  Seyfriend being accused of being a witch.  Skeletons from characters' pasts coming back to haunt them.  Crazy crusader oppressing those he has been sent to protect.  An unrequited romance that has no sizzle.  And finally the werewolf's identity revealed, surprising but not earth shaking, and outcome of the romance.  That's it.  Not Red Riding Hood.

A better title for this film would've been Blood Moon, as the wolf's powers of transformation and created cursed is based on the three days the moon is blood red.  Why is Seyfriend given the red hood?  What is the point?  It's not symbolic of anything and it just seems shoehorned into the story for no real reason.  Why is there a dream sequence where she has a very famous interchange with her grandmother-""Grandma, what big eyes you have""?  It all seems out of place.  Why not say something with the material.  Werewolves have an inherant primal theme regarding letting the wild side out of ones personality.  Why not do somthing with this.  This is instead a bug hunt with a werewolf at the center.

The acting from Seyfried and Oldman are fine.  Seyfriend is a real original presence on the screen these days.  She holds the movie fine.  Oldman hams it up but keeps it roped in just enough to keep us from laughing.  He becomes a villain of sorts towards the end of the second act.  That's another thing, there's only about three werewolf attacks in the film.  Even the third act has our main werewolf appearing only in human form.  There's some stuff in here about Red Riding Hood being a witch due to her mental connection to the wolf, but it's really just there to muddle the plot, which as far as I could tell, was about finding and unmasking a werewolf.  The rest of the cast is forgettable.  Max Lions rich boy suitor barely registers.  He is written as a wet blanket.  At the end of the film there are explanations of him becoming the protector of the village and the leader of a werewolf hunt, but there's no build up or investment in this, so it barely matters.  The woodsman is wood, wood, WOODEN.  This guy is a decent looking but he has no chemistry with Seyfried, he isn't written very well, and he's not a good enough or charismatic enough actor to pull off wood lines or listless interaction.  Virginia Madsen is in this thing too....but wasted.

Now the effects and set designs are amazing.  The set design here, mostly practical, are the best I've seen since Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow.  The werewolf is more of a large black wolf, and made totally of CGI.  It looks okay most of the time.  CGI animals still havea  tendancy to movie too fast through the screen make it more obvious that they are animated.  Looking at this film with the sound off would be okay it's so well shot and designed.  Also, I really liked the score and soundtrack.  It's modern sounding but not too much that it be distracting.  Considering this story takes place in a nondescript time period in a made up time and place, it really doesn't bother me that no one has an accent, people speak and act modern, and all looks a little too clean.  It's a fairy tale looking world without a fairy tale being told.  Okay.........

The film is fine while on.  The love stuff is uninspired as written and performed.  The story is no allegory, but rather a straight monster movie with a whodunit in the mix.  It's nothing special but fluffy eye candy that you may love or just forget.  The people who hate it seem to have some vendetta against Twilight.  Although, I wonder why they talk so much about or even watch things like this or Twilight if they hate them so much.  Why not do something, you know, more productinve or that make you happy?  Then, what would they do on the internet all day?

Blu ray looks beautiful to match the photography.  The special features are negligable.  The alternate ending actually makes more sense than the theatrical cut.  There's some added PG-13 steamy sex, and a final reveal in the final moments that really don't matter that much if you think about it.  But since the extended cut makes more sense in the edit(theatrical version has a montage of the never shown sex scene that is very confusing) actually showing the love making it's a better ending.  That's all.  The only other feature I was interested in was one about the making of the werewolf.  It's not a featurette.  It's a montage of wire frame CGI werewolves, some onset doubles with music playng in the background for about three minutes.  Some interviews with conceptual artists would've been nice.  Lame.

1) a hokey ending. They could have been more imaginative.

2) non-white characters in a classic, medieval European setting. Please, if there's anything worse than a blatantly racist film, it's one where they try too hard to place non-white characters where everyone with a brain knows they wouldn't be - don't insult the audience. I understand the importance of ""inclusion"", but this was just plain stupid.

3) the romantic male lead's hair was way too modern and trendy. Where - tell me EXACTLY where - did he find the hair gel for that ""do"" of his?!? Was there a magical hair gel pond? Were there magical hair gel elves in the forest?

4224001,1,B003Y5H54W,"I gotta say as werewolf stories go, this is the lamest attempt I've ever witnessed. This remote village in the middle of no where (looks like the Bavarian Alps) looks less like a medieval story land and more like a full page ad from a fashion magazine. Where did this small village get all its hair stylist and mousse!
Its the middle of the 'hardest winter' they've ever known, they're living in log huts on the edge of a dark forest where dwells a ravenous werewolf, there is no inside plumbing, the only hot water they have is boiled in small kettles over a wood fire, but some how the entire village is squeaky clean and neatly pressed.
This movie tried too hard to tie all the disparate mythologies from Brothers Grim into a neat little package and make them palatable for all the Stephenie Meyer fans and it failed terribly.
The acting (except for Gary Oldman) was terrible. The lighting was monotonous. The script writing was poor and the musical score was painfully annoying.

4224023,2,B003Y5H54W,"It seems the current obsession with vampires and werewolves is so omnipresent that it even invades fairy tales. The original children's story is described as this: 'The earliest known printed version was known as Le Petit Chaperon Rouge and had its origins in 17th century French folklore. It was included in the collection Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose (Histoires et contes du temps pass, avec des moralits. Contes de ma mre l'Oye), in 1697, by Charles Perrault. As the title implies, this version is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault. The story had as its subject an ""attractive, well-bred young lady"", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for the Red Riding Hood. The latter ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.'

Now take that old tale and replace the wolf with a werewolf (this is not the first time in world literature that this has been done!) and presto, RED RIDING HOOD appears as Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) who since childhood has been in love with the poor woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) but Valerie's parents (Virginia Madsen and Billly Burke) have other plans: marry Valerie to the wealthy (but oh so good hearted) Henry (Max Irons),a factor that sets up a love triangle for the film.  Valerie's sister is found dead, the victim of a werewolf who has the reputation for killing all members of the family once he has a victim.  The village is terrified and arms against the werewolf.  Valerie seeks solace from her grandmother (Julie Christie) and with Peter.  A charlatan arrives in the village - Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) - to choreograph the end of the werewolf: he is assisted by a little crew of soldiers and by the local priest Father Auguste (Lukas Haas).  The werewolf strikes again and from there on out it is a wild chase to discover the daylight identity of the werewolf who only takes on the form of the beastie when the moon is full and red. To say more would be labeled spoilers and the story is so simple minded that no further help is needed.

The story was written in this format by David Johnson and directed by the queen of vampire and werewolves Catherine Hardwicke (the Twilight series). The producer of this film is Leonardo DiCaprio which may explain why so many good actors were drawn to this insipid little disaster of a film. By now even the appetites of the teen audience for these stories is pretty saturated and this film did not succeed in drawing a big audience.  The cast does the best with what they are given (Max Irons gives evidence of a true find but the talents of Christie, Oldman, Burke, and Madsen are frittered away.

4224031,3,B003Y5H54W,"A young woman, growing up in a small town where everybody seems to think they know what's best for her, is just becoming aware of her own sexuality and knows that something more is out there.  It turns out, there is something more out there, but it's a bit scary, and if she goes out on her own she might get hurt.

That's the basic scenario that the original fairy tale is designed to address - and in some ways the moral remains timelessly relevant - that while it's understandable that a young woman would be curious what lies out there in the woods, there's a real risk that what she'll find is the big bad wolf (whether he comes in sheep's clothing as the ""nice"" guy who makes promises but abandons her when she gets pregnant, or whether he's the even more dangerous type who never bothers to pretend being nice).

This modern version - directed by Catherine Hardwicke from the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B003ZKBELG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>&nbsp;film - tweaks the original story, but stays true to its basic structure (even as it tweaks the moral of the story slightly to suggest that while the danger is real, empowered young women can still find a way to become independent and find love).  What's clear from this film is that she's not all that interested in creating timeless tales that transcend the demands of the teen audience she hopes will follow her from Twilight.  The young crush, the goth sensibilities, the daddy issues, the dark romance, are all tailor-made for today's teenagers.  I guess that's fine - but it meant that while my daughters liked this I really couldn't connect as I sometimes can with films of this sort.  I couldn't connect with the Twilight films either.

I will say that Hardwicke has a very keen eye for visual composition - and does create the aura of a fairy tale here.  She really knows what to do with a red cape.  I'm impressed that she seems to manage much of the look of the film, as she did in Twilight, in camera, by the way she and her team shoot and light scenes and through the costumes, rather than through digital enhancement (although I'm sure they spent quite a bit of time on digital postprocessing).

For all the bad rap this film got from those who really wanted it to go much darker or bigger (they should try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Company-of-Wolves/dp/B00006G8H3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Company of Wolves</a>, which I consider to be a better and more timeless version than this one, that's also quite scary) - this wasn't a bad retelling of the original story.

This is obviously an ADAPTATION of the Red Riding Hood story, a far fetching, albeit quite interesting take on the story.  You have a grandmother, a wolf, red riding hood, etc.  That's about where the similarity ends.

Catherine Hardwicke is known for her colorful, contrasting shots of cinematography and in certain places during the film she didn't disappoint.  What was hard to accept was the bad acting and incongruous script.  Valerie (Red) lost her sister to the Wolf and it was like no great emotion.  A small, blip of a mourning scene then it was life as usual.  Now perhaps it was bad editing and the raw emotions of losing her sister (this includes the parents, mind you) was left on the cutting room floor, but the acting seemed disconnected from what the characters were supposed to be feeling.  No depth, really bad flow.  Too bad.

Gary Oldham was great, as he really always is and maybe that showed up the rest of the cast.  But it just fell flat.  You never bought into the story or the characters so it made the movie SLOOOOOWWWWWW.

Many comparisons to Twilight I have read here.  The only connection is she directed that movie as well.  Will have to say her filming style comes through and thats the only reference you can make as these plots are dissimilar.

All in all, rent don't buy.  And be prepared for lackluster acting and a mediocre script.  Visually quite appealing but not sure you want to invest for just that.",1308096000,,1622,4.581881533101045

4224075,4,B003Y5H54W,"I have never had this chance before in disliking a movie for so many reasons, but then publicly giving it a high rating - so here goes.

The story follows a character called Red Riding Hood that has a completely different plot than I have ever read or heard before, including werewolves, guys with Twilight hairdos, and hundreds of anachronisms depending on which era the filmmakers were actually trying to obtain. I feel it is fair regarding the hatred felt for this movie because of all the Twilightisms - this from the same person who directed Twilight also spun her wares on Red's story. With that comes all of the horrible acting, bad writing, incredibly fake stage sets containing no elements of external reality (snow that never melts, no breath is ever visible, echoes in open air, no skylines, etc) and a ""provocative"" ending.

But aside from all of that, the entire product is thorough and worthy. The picture quality has some outstanding references, mostly surrounding the color and line clarity of her red cloak, but the opening sequence of aerial vistas made the beginning trick you into thinking the whole film will be beautiful. The DTS is adequate but surrounds you mostly with the score and one or two of the wolf attacks. The supplements are a few stars in themselves:

* Each menu selection is given a pic frame once selected that shows a time stamp and further description of what the feature is - wish all BDs did this.
* Deleted scenes, 4 @ 4:18 minutes. There is only one reminiscent of the dream theme that should have stayed in, but glad the rest were cut.
* Gag reel, 2:37 minutes. Not too funny, but showed they were having fun making this mess.
* Music Videos, 2 @ 5:27 minutes. The closing song and the party song - the party/dance song video is actually better than the movie.
* Secrets behind the Cloak, PiP at an almost 40% screen fill during film. Hardwicke and cast give their insights intermittently, more interesting than the film and it actually screens better.
* Reinvention of the tale, 5:25 minutes. The history behind the real story and how they came to the conclusion this film was actually a good idea.
* Men of RRH, 3:18 minutes. Barf. All the girls get to say how enamored they are with each guy actor and how cute they are.
* Music score, 10:59 minutes. Thorough depiction of how the music score came to be - worth it for the fans of the music.
* Wolf CGI, 46 seconds. Skip this at all costs, shows the stand-ins and rough CGI.
* Casting tapes, 3 @ 7:24 minutes. More painful than the movie.
* Rehearsals, 3 @ 5:52 minutes. Shows the dance sequence prep, boring.
* Red Riding Hood in 73 seconds. Fast forwards the movie for you with several stops as to see apparently the important shots - whatever.
* DVD of the film.
*Alternate ""provocative"" ending. I should have read the back of the case first - as it was rated PG-13 also. Spoilers: they have PG-13 lust and make a wolf baby...oooh wow. Roughly 90 seconds of alternate footage and snow love.

I suppose my biggest issue is I made the mistake of screening this at the local high school graduation night not having seen it yet - and literally hundreds of teens commented on how bad the movie was. They all complained it looked like Twilight and the story was horrible. If you can't keep the target audience happy this film is in trouble.

Not being a fan of the ""Twilight"" movies (this movie is directed by Catherine Hardwicke, who directed the first ""Twilight"") I just could not get into this movie. I will admit though that being a huge Gary Oldman fan I really liked his character, being so brutal helped me enjoy it a little.  This is totally geared toward the ""Twilight"" crowd.

The women too are so packed with makeup I was waiting for the Avon lady to show up at any moment. (Perhaps Dianne Wiest from Edward Scissorhands?)

The dialogue is so supremely awful at times you have to hope director Catherine Hardwicke was aiming to make this film as much like a fairy tale as possible. If I remember right, old-time fables are not known for their witty banter. But saying that, Hardwicke failed to commit fully to the fairy tale theme. She's got the imagery down, but the themes cockeyed. This movie tries to be unique, yet stays within the boundaries of a Hollywood blockbuster. As a viewer, you feel like you're watching something that could be great, but somehow misses the mark because it quickly drags the story to fall within your expectations again.

4224125,3,B003Y5H54W,"RED RIDING HOOD is a re-imagining of the classic fairytale. The problem is that they've turned it into a soft-core teen romance, and since I haven't been a teen for 2 or 3 decades, I found the love scenes disturbing. Can you say, ""Peeping Tom?"" I knew that you could!

So be aware that RED RIDING HOOD is a period teen romance with supernatural creatures, none of whom sparkle. Beyond that, it's mildly entertaining with okay performances by Gary Oldman and Julie Christie. They're only okay, which is a shame, but the movie isn't about them. Neither is it about Lukas Haas (didn't he die of an overdose of Pop-Rocks in Vietnam?) who has an odd part to play. All of the acting is serviceable but there's nothing exciting about it. Again, it's all about the teens and even though they're pretty, they're nothing to write home about.

Oh, I forgot to mention the plot of RED RIDING HOOD. Here goes: A teeny-weenie medieval village is terrorized by a werewolf. Gary Oldman is a sort of Grand Inquisitor cum Van Helsing who arrives to save the day. Madcap mayhem (and teen love) ensue.

I gave RED RIDING HOOD a 3 because I recognize that I am not the target demographic. If you're a veteran of more than 25 summers, you might want to steer clear of this one. Peeping Toms, on the other hand...",1306713600,17,1290,4.504273504273504

4224127,1,B003Y5H54W,"Red Riding Hood is an exercise in endurance because it is so laughably bad. And this review comes from a guy who tends to find redeeming quality in movies that get poor reviews. Almost everyone I knew- teen and adult alike- who saw the movie didn't like it very much. My wife and I still had our hopes up for this movie, realizing in the end it was probably a film geared toward young girls but entertaining, nonetheless.

However, there is very little to redeem Red Riding Hood. Other than some gorgeous shots of the landscapes and panoramic views of the village where the ""story"" takes place, this is truly terrible movie.

Looking to make this movie a blind buy on Bluray? Some words of caution: First off, ""Red Riding Hood"" is geared toward 13-14 year old girls... and not just any 13-14 girl, but very dumb 13-14 year old girls. Thankfully, most youngsters are too smart for this movie, which is why it was such a collasal box office flop. In other words, this movie insults the intelligence of your average 13 year old girl... adults need not even bother. There's nothing in the movie young (or older) males would like. This is a chick flick that couldn't find success with its target audience... or anyone else for that matter.

I'm being too harsh, you say? Allow me to explain, for those of you who are fortunate enough to have not not seen this movie and wondering whether it's worth a $20 blind buy on Bluray.

The most painful thing about watching this movie is the acting: modern day young actors portraying 19th century villagers... You never for one moment actually feel swept away to another time or another place. For example, there is a scene where the villagers are celebating, and Red Riding Hood and some others are actually dirty dancing!! In real life, no young girl back then would publically grind her pelvis like a pole dancer in a Puritan village! If so, imagine the community uproar! In other words, no sense of realism whatsoever.

At least they didn't attempt to talk in fake British accents- none of them could have pulled it off and it would have made the viewing experience all the more painful to endure.
Let's take a moment and zoom into the village where the bulk of the movie takes place. No time period is given, but made to feel like some time in the 1700's, perhaps early 1800's. However, the paper-thin characters all act as though they are transplanted from modern California. At least they didn't attempt to talk in fake British accents- none of them could have pulled it off and it would have made the viewing experience all the more painful to endure.

We have three main characters: Red Riding Hood, who is upset because she has to marry someone she doesn't want, a young attractive guy who is the noble ""good boy."" She's in love with the village ""bad boy."" Why? Because he's a hunk, of course! He also skulks around and acts angry at the world. Why is he angry at the word? Because he's a bad boy, or course! Duh! Oh, and he's a hunk... with lots of hair gel. That's the extent of the character development in this movie. He looks like a 21st century Elvis who squints like Clint Eastwood, wears too much hair gel, dresses in very fashionable black threads (particularly for a Puritan village) and seems about as much from the 1800's as George Jetson (albiet a young, hunky George Jetson). Oh, and he can't act.

Oh, and there's a big bad wolf who is killing people. The wolf can talk to Red Riding Hood- which was an interesting premise that was never developed upon. The story is too interested in the horrifically cliche'd ""love triangle""... will Red Riding Hood get to have sex with the bad boy??? Will she have to give it up to the noble nice guy who is cute but too nice to consider sleeping with??? Does anyone older than 13 even care?

Then there's the big mystery... who is the big bad wolf? Many people are made the suspect, and sadly when all is revealed it ends laughably bad.

SPOILER AHEAD: DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW IT ENDS

The ending is the most laughable part of this god-awful movie. After all the suspects are given to us, the real werewolf is Red Riding Hood's own father. To make a long story short, ""Elvis"" (and his perfectly gelled hair) comes to her rescue, and they butcher her father with no remorse. However, Elvis is accidentally bitten, which means he will now be a werewolf. They have sex, she's heart broken that he must leave the village so no one finds out. I mean, let's slaughter the hell out of dear old Dad for being a werewolf, then screw the hell out of hunky hair gel boy for being the same damn thing dad was slaughtered for in the first place. If only dear old dad was a hunky bad boy with lots of hair gel..
The two big messages of this ""deeply profound"" mess of a movie:
  1) nice boys should get respect, but bad boys should get laid.
  2) dads are easily expendable- kill the worthless SOB, bury him at sea, then get impregnated by the bad boy (it's the right the thing to do, you know).

END OF SPOILERS

4224300,4,B003Y5H54W,"In concept, Red Riding Hood, and TV shows like CSI have one thing in common: one can not stiff the villain through logic. Shows like CSI can successfully turn out hours of entertainment simply because of the increased use of technology in criminology. They fascinate the audience for thirty minutes, do a couple of interviews, and a DNA sample, and we get our killer. The technology not only simplifies the police's pursuit, but the storytelling that could have been intricate. Identifying the villain in Red Riding Hood is not dissimilar, and seemingly impossible considering the countless choices thrown at out during the film.

Red Riding Hood is a folk tale, and as such has received treatment from countless literary and dramatic figures. The character's age also shifts from rendition. In some she's young, and in others, like this, she's well passed puberty, and chasing after a childhood friend. The village has been at peace with the werewolf for years offering him sacrifices every month, and he this hefty bargain has kept the villagers safe for some time. Eventually, the wolf strikes, and kills a villager.  Sickened with his disobedience, the villagers hunt down a wolf, eventually finding out that they have simply slain a regular grey wolf. Eventually, a witch hunter, Father Solomom, is called to hunt the werewolf, whom the villagers believe for a time happens to be their common grey wolf. Father Solomon , exceeding at creating controversy, makes the villagers doubt their sons, daughters, parents, friends, and neighbors. The fear escalates, and the village must put an end to the beast before the fear creates a widespread version of the Salem Witch Trails.

Amanda Seyfried is THE reason to see this film. It is not a phenomenal performance from her, but she is able to keep this film alive with her acting and beauty. Certain actors like Seyfried, and the virtuoso Meryl Streep,  can make a mediocre film appear likeable without outright sex or nudity-which this film does not contain. Someone like Megan Fox can kiss boys, girls, be surrounded by transformers, and her beauty shines through, but not her acting. Thankfully, the filmmakers knew that they are not dealing with a date film, so they did not inject an overt amount of sexuality in this film. The importance of this is that in that case, it would more familiar a story than it already does. Besides Seyfried, and possibly Julie Christie, every other performance pales in comparison. Basically because the two mentioned characters, every other character only observes the incidents-besides the main love interests-without saying anything worth mentioning. Even the versatile Gary Oldman gives an over-the-top performance, but not an entirely memorable one.

The identity of the werewolf is a mystery that most not deeply be pondered. There are no overt clues that one can grasp at, and name the person. If someone can, he or she must be a genius, and should immediately start writing mystery, because I only found slight clues about the werewolf's identity. This is a film that unfolds, and one needs to just enjoy the way nearly most of the supporting characters are accused, and not forgiven until the conclusion. The film does not want to engage our minds, but our hearts, It wants to tear at our heartbeats, making us fear for Valerie, and the people who are accused and tortured for having communication with or being the werewolf based on speculations.

At the core of it, this film is not very memorable.  It reaches a conclusion without offending reason or its own narrative thread. It succeeds brilliantly at building tension between the characters, but when the werewolf must be revealed, it does not shock. Sure, it DOES surprise, but with a few narrative changes I could have successfully made anyone else the werewolf. The final incident of the film would have made excellent fodder for a sequel, but Director Catherine Hardwicke decides to patch up the film quickly. The film does not suffer because of this, but it could have become intersting if the filmmaker had dared a little more.

I must admit that this was a fun film, whenever and wherever it's set. It's a must for Amanda Seyfried fan's who will be happy to know that she is maturing into a wonderful actress, possessing the same qualities that made and continues to make Meryl Streep a star. Even though it may not be entirely memorable, it benefits from a solid screenplay that, if nothing else, makes this a solid, enjoyable movie.",1303689600,4,4493,4.949602122015915
4224301,5,B003Y5H54W,"This re-imagining of the centuries-old fairy tale ""Little Red Cap"" opens with a lush and beautiful flight over a mountainous medieval landscape dotted with castles, mills and vast forests. The camera finally descends to show us a picturesque village plucked from a storybook, quickly introducing us to the film's heroine Valerie and her handsome suitor Peter. The lovers' happiness is quickly shattered with the discovery of a body - Valerie's sister, slain by ""The Wolf"" which has long stalked their tiny village. Despite the dreamy, rich visuals, Red Riding Hood's first act feels rushed, sacrificing character and narrative flow to reach the first inevitable encounter with the `Big Bad Wolf'. In some ways the decision pays off however, because it is here the film finds its stride. The stormy love story and romantic rivalries which weave through the film are nothing new, and we never doubt which brooding hunk our heroine will choose. This all takes a backseat however to the dual growing menace of the hungry werewolf and the equally fanatical priest who arrives to destroy the beast. Soon it becomes clear that the werewolf has a special interest in Valerie, which leads the village to brand her as a witch. The zealous werewolf-hunter decides to use her as bait, leading to a final encounter with the beast.

Red Riding Hood is something of a mixed bag, with an engaging story marred by occasionally hackneyed dialogue and bland performances. Even-so, the film somehow manages to rise above its shortcomings, leading to a climax which is both exciting and unexpected. While I may be biased, the true selling point for this was the werewolf itself - A gigantic, four-footed, black beast which talks, schemes, and seems somehow less villainous than the cruel inquisitor who arrives to slay him. The resolution of Red Riding Hood's `whodunnit' mystery may be a bit bizarre, but it's final moments offer a sort-of twisted `happy ending' that sent me home with a big smile on my face.",1302393600,9,1989,4.990963855421687
4224302,4,B003Y5H54W,"May contain plot spoilers.

Two guys compete for the attention of a young female. The movie is a who-dun-it as we have to figure out who is the werewolf as clues lead us in opposite directions. Red Riding Hood's sister is killed by a werewolf after 20 years of peace. The villagers then go to the cave of the wolf, kill a regular wolf and think they got the werewolf. A man is killed in the attack. Now this is where the plot twists. We find out early on that Red's sister was only her half sister and the man who was killed hunting the wolf was really her father. Red is in love with Peter, the poor woodcutter who reminds me too much of Twilight's Edward. Red is supposed to marry Henry, the blacksmith who happens to be the son of the man who was killed as well as Red's sister's half-brother. Red's sister was in love with Henry, but never knew he was her half-brother, and neither did Red's daddy. Got all that? Because I sure didn't.

Gary Oldman shows up as the professional werewolf killer with a silver sword blessed by the Pope. He conducts a ""witch hunt"" in order to flush out the werewolf. The scene I liked best was the celebration of the death of the wolf. The music could best be described as pagan rave music. It was played with ancient instruments with off setting drums. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. It was a mystery, love story, and werewolf movie wrapped into one. The major down side was the mediocre acting of Peter and Henry, the two suitors.

This is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on an old story. If your looking for originality don't look here. If you are looking for a film to escape that is what this film is.

""I don't know. I've been down this path before...""

""Come with me.""

""What will make your movie different? Most movies look good during the trailers because they show all of the best bits. But few are able to deliver on that promise. Very few.""

""thornhill, come with me. Follow me to this little village I have created for the film. It could be an old German village. It could be in Eastern Europe. It could be in old Russia. It could be many things. This is the beauty of my little village; because the film is based on a fairy tale, I can and will keep things fairly enigmatic.""

""But that is part of the problem. If you are creating a fictional world, it needs to look real. Your village looks like a set.""

""Most films are made on sets... Won't you come with me?""

""Yes, but...""

""Come with me. My film is good. You will enjoy it.""

""...Most films are adequately able to disguise the sets. They pay a lot of money to make everything look as real as possible. You paid a lot of money to make everything look like a set. Your fable needs a distinctive time and place to ground it in reality, to make it seem believable and real.""

""Come with me...""

""Just because you are adapting a fairytale does not mean your screenplay has license to be subpar. I understand you are adapting something...""

""Won't you come with me? Take my hand. I will lead you away from the sorry state of the multiplex....""

""...That was probably 10 or 20 pages originally into a film that runs about 100 minutes, creating a lot of story to fill, a lot of dialogue to create. But if you don't have the ideas to create a feature-length story, don't do it. Simply repeating phrases or ideas over and over again does not create suspense. You need to create characters and let them grow throughout the course of the story.""

""Are you thornhill?""

""It seems like your screenwriter David Johnson (""Orphan"", the upcoming sequel to ""Clash of the Titans"" (Don't get me started on that one)) becomes bored and simply can't be bothered to come up with any new ideas. Did he have a quota of pages to fill? Even ideas and situations are repeated. I can see the value in repeating a small number of these, for instance, showing us how Reverend Solomon's (Gary Oldman) Trojan Elephant works. And then putting one of the lovers in the contraption should create considerable suspense. But somehow, somewhere, the suspense is lost and even this moment falls flat.""

""Are you thornhill?

""Are you thornhill?""

""I understand why you were chosen to helm this film. You made the first ""Twilight"" film and helped to create a franchise. But does your interpretation of ""Red Riding Hood"" have to seem like a sequel to the uber-popular Vampire saga? You even have three brooding, fairly attractive young people at the center of the story.""

""Come with me. Are you thornhill?""

""But the number one priority for you should have been to find better actors. Amanda Seyfried (HBO's ""Big Love"", ""Mamma Mia"") is okay, but she spends a maddening amount of time staring into other people's eyes. During her initial confrontation with the wolf, she realizes he has human eyes, so she spends the rest of the film staring into other people's eyes trying to identify the wolf. This and the constant utterances of ""Are you the wolf?"" help create a thin, but extremely overwrought tale. It is actually quite a feat to create a story that is both thin and overwrought. Kudos to you and Mr. Reynolds.""

""Are you thornhill?

""Come with me.""

""The two young men, Seyfried's suitors, are both good looking, but such obvious stand-ins for Robert Pattison and Taylor Lautner it becomes frustrating. The attempts to copy the ""Twilight"" formula are blatant and continue throughout. The most frustrating thing?  Shiloh Fernandez and  Max Irons make Pattinson and Lautner look like Laurence Olivier. They are simply two of the worst actors I have seen in some time. At one point, they confront each other on a transom surrounding the village square. This moment is, by no means, unique because they confront each other many times. During this particular confrontation Irons stops Fernandez. Fernandez turns abruptly and says, almost shouting ""I'm not the wolf"". He darts his eyes back and forth and repeats the line, this time at barely a whisper. ""I'm not the wolf.""""

""Are you thornhill? Come with me...""

""Catherine, you should stick with small, independent films. These projects allow you to concentrate on the actors and their performances. When you don't have the distractions of a big budget film, this is where your strengths lie. ""thirteen"" was really good. Exactly the type of film you should make. But when you took the reigns of ""Twilight"" I fear your career was changed for ever. You became the director of a huge hit and I'm not sure you will be able to go back. Or if you even want to. These big budget films are too much for you. The acting in ""Twilight"" is okay, but I'm not sure how or what you added to the success of this film. I think my cat could've directed ""Twilight"" and it still would have made a gazillion dollars. But because of that success, and the studios eagerness to repeat it, you were brought in to ""Twilight""-ize ""Red Riding Hood"". Bravo. ""Twilight""-ize it you did. What this film really needs is the hand of someone like Tim Burton or Terry Gilliam.""

""You must come with me. I promise you an escape.

""Are you thornhill?""

""And the acting in ""Riding Hood"" is universally bad. Or just bland. Julie Christie plays Grandma and a few of her lines brought laughter from the audience when they weren't supposed to. Billy Burke (Bella's dad in ""Twilight"") plays Papa. Now that's a stretch. Papa's big scene involves him throwing up in the middle of the town square. Virginia Madsen is Mama and her story seems pulled out of a soap opera with acting to match. Both performances are problematic. Lukas Haas plays the village priest, a scared, cowardly man who eagerly awaits the arrival of his elder, the Reverend Solomon (Oldman). Oldman's performance is the only one with any energy. Usually, I am the first to loathe a film which contains actors using a bunch of fake accents, but ""Riding Hood"" is just the opposite problem. The film is set in a fictional village in the 16th Century (?) yet everyone sounds like they are from California.""

""Come with me, thornhill. I promise you this film will be good...""

""You can't make that promise, Catherine. Because ""Red Riding Hood"" is a big, hot mess.

The last half of the movie seemed that the actors redeemed themselves; however, the wolf was hilariously computery looking and looked more like an old Nintendo graphic rather than something from a 2011 werewolf movie.

4224307,3,B003Y5H54W,"This ""Red Riding Hood"" reminds us that, back when these stories originated, they captured real and adult fears. We have our own fears today, including the witch-hunt that adds tension to much of the movie - a complex set of tensions that touches each person differently. Themes of secrecy and betrayal, parental ambition, and divided affection also contribute their part to this mix.

So, when all these very workable parts add together, is the total so much less than the sum of the parts? I'm not sure. The divided loyalties lack urgency, the surprise near the end comes seemingly from nowhere, with no dramatic buildup, and the demise of the witch-hunter seems a bit too pat. The movie flows well and uses imagery with good effect. Despite its Twilight overtones, the script just never gave much to care about. I enjoyed this well enough, as commodity entertainment, but won't be hunting it down again.

4224308,1,B003Y5H54W,"In 1984, director Neil Jordan directed The Company of Wolves, an adult take on the classic fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood. The film was released to critical raves and became a cult classic. Art-house audiences around the world embraced this metaphorical fantasy of sexual awakening, which was also an effective horror film, featuring an extremely creepy performance from Angela Lansbury as The Grandmother. Sarah Patterson was breathtaking in the lead role as Rosaleen, also known as Red Riding Hood. Her performance was subtle and utterly convincing. These wonderful performances against the ethereal setting and rich symbolism of Neil Jordan's script made for an intellectually stimulating, albeit horrifying and, dare I say it, fun time at the cinema. It is now 2011, and modern audiences are not as lucky. No, they have Red Riding Hood, Catherine Hardwicke's latest Twilight rip-off.

Everything about Red Riding Hood screams Twilight from the dizzying opening credits onward. The setting is a bit different, and there are a few awkward references to familiar elements of the fairy tale, but make no mistake - this is as formulaic a film as you are ever going to see this year. It concerns a teenage girl named Valerie, played by Amanda Seyfried, who is in love with a boy. This does not matter to her mother - played by Virginia Madsen, in a thankless role - who insists that her daughter marry the richest boy in the village, in hopes that the young girl will lead a privileged life.  Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce Peter and Henry, the first cousins of Jacob and Edward. Poor Peter decides that he will run away with Valerie regardless of her mother's wishes, but his plans are thwarted as a result of the man-eating wolf that keeps terrorizing the small town. Added to that, Rich Boy Henry keeps popping into the picture, trying to win over the young girl's heart. As per usual in this particular type of situation, she becomes torn between the two men - and then one dark night, the wolf appears to her and begins to speak. You read that correctly. Wolfie informs her that he will come to collect her in a matter of days, and that she had better be prepared. Of course, Valerie is freaked out, and her peers begin to doubt her sanity. As she begins to count down the minutes before Wolfie's inevitable return, she confides in her two boy toys for help. Meanwhile, the village idiot recruits a creepy Gary Oldman - who is some sort of lycanthropy expert - to ward off the werewolf with the aid of his silver fingernails and an unnecessarily large metal elephant. If it sounds pathetic, that's because it is. In case you are wondering, there is a Grandmother character, compliments of Julie Christie. She is the only interesting character in the entire film, the only reason being that her performance borders on extreme camp.  By the time the third act of the film rolls around, you will have guessed who the Wolfie is, and you will not be surprised. You just may roll your eyes in disgust as I did.

Catherine Hardwicke is a capable director when she has a good script to work with. Anyone who has seen Thirteen or The Nativity Story knows this. However, she is also a sucker for angst-ridden, teeny-bopper soap operas, hence her involvement in this film. Neil Jordan's The Company of Wolves is obviously the better film, and one that I highly recommend. If you are smart, you will add that film to your Netflix queue, and skip Red Riding Hood altogether.

The performances are uniformly terrible, and there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to be found here.",1300320000,6,3583,4.763285024154589
4224309,5,B003Y5H54W,"Red Riding Hood is a re-imagining of the fairy tale. The film is very atmospheric in creating a medieval village, and the sense of doom is palpable. The lead character, Valerie is in love with an orphaned woodcutter named Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) but it has been arranged that she will marry the far richer Henry (Max Irons) who is a blacksmith.  The only problem is that the village is terrorized by a werewolf and has been for more than a generation offering up a sacrifice when the moon is full. When the werewolf kills Valerie's sister, the village is galvanized into hunting down the creature.

Into this mix comes a werewolf hunter named Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) who is ruthless in his methods to find and destroy the werewolf.  There are limitless possibilities as to who the werewolf could be and Solomon becomes more of a curse to the village than the werewolf does.  The filmmakers created a great look for the village and the film was well cast. Gary Oldman is perfect as Solomon, and it is refreshing to see him play a villain again. Amanda Seyfried is nicely cast as the lead character as are her love interests.  Virginia Madsen was also excellent as Valerie's mother, who has her own dark secret. It was also good to see Julie Christie in a film as Valerie's somewhat sinister grandmother.

The movie teeters toward a B-movie romance (one wonders if Valerie will suddenly declare her love for Henry as he proves himself very noble-hearted) but the mystery and horror of the werewolf kept my interest in the story.  Although Red Riding Hood may seem like ""Twilight for werewolves,"" I liked the story and the overall feel of mystery. Red Riding Hood is a film that I would like to see again maybe only for the marvelous visual realization of the village, grandma's, lonely but cozy cottage and the over-the-top performance of Gary Oldman.",1300233600,138,1855,4.724458204334366
