2697081,5,B000KRNKOG,I loved this DVD!  I was looking for something that was challenging that I could do at home.  I'm sold on Jeanette Jenkins!  She's easy to follow & very knowledgable.,1230422400,3,166,4.466666666666667
2697082,5,B000KRNKOG,"Great workout, Not at all boring and Jeannette keeps me moving and she is also humorous. I have lost 13 lbs so far and loving it.",1206316800,2,129,4.0
2697083,5,B000KRNKOG,"This is one of the best ab workouts I have done.  It's only 20 minutes long, but covers all areas of the abdominals as opposed to just one area. Jeanette is very knowledgeable & thorough.  I highly recommend it for an intense at home ab workout.",1200268800,6,245,4.304347826086956
2697084,5,B000KRNKOG,"I bought this video in a set of 5 videos. The workout is 20 minutes long and is only ab work. Its a great video for anyone looking to get that six pack. Jeanette is a great instructor, she makes you work until you feel the burn. Would recommend to anyone.",1198540800,7,255,4.019607843137255

This is a great dvd to work on your abs.  A good hard workout. You will definitely feel this one. I get bored with long exercise sessions but this one is short and to the point. Very well made. I would recommend this because of the price and short effective workout.",1197331200,4,437,6.406779661016949
2697086,5,B000KRNKOG,"This ab series is perfect.  It is short and thorough.  There are different exercises that provide a complete abdominal workout.  And, it can be done by ""regular people"".  Some exercises may be more challenging, but everyone can do them.",1191456000,7,236,4.9743589743589745
2697087,5,B000KRNKOG,"I'm always on the hunt for ab routines. At $7.00, I couldn't pass this one up. Jeanette's personality is very likable. She's knows what she's talking about. It's a great ""add on"" dvd to any routine, clocking in at 20 minutes.",1188864000,2,225,4.512195121951219
2697088,5,B000KRNKOG,"This yoga workout actually makes you sweat, which is great because so many other yoga DVDs are way too slow and involve too much explaining and talking. This one gets right into it and is challenging.",1180483200,8,200,4.583333333333333
2697089,5,B000KRNKOG,This is my 3rd video of Jeanette Jenkins so I knew what to expect. She always gives a great workout. I love how she will give you another option if you aren't as advance. Also the price was good.,1460505600,,195,4.0256410256410255
2697090,2,B000KRNKOG,When I think power yoga I think Vinyasa and balancing including arm balancing poses. This video is very beginner friendly - not much to offer for someone wanting a quick moving workout with advanced poses.,1448668800,,205,4.885714285714286
2697091,2,B000KRNKOG,It is difficult to rate this item - primarily because my DVDs seemed defective. Everyone talks about being able to customize their segments but my dvd only allowed me to watch it straight through. To be honest. I found this dvd quite boring. The warm up was too long - and boring. The overall pace of the dvd was too slow. I like a faster pace - power yoga'ish and this fell short.,1447372800,,381,4.232876712328767
2697092,4,B000KRNKOG,"Super hard to keep up in the beginning but i'm getting there, I just gotta keep at it!!",1444176000,,87,3.888888888888889

2697096,5,B000KRNKOG,Great workout.  Doesn't injure you,1439164800,,34,5.8
2697097,5,B000KRNKOG,This is one of my favorite,1434585600,,26,3.5
2697098,5,B000KRNKOG,"I feel brand new each time I follow the routines on this DVD! A must-have for any and everyone, whether you're brand new to yoga, a long-time practitioner/ instructor, or just looking for a great way to get started on your fitness journey.",1433203200,,239,4.5813953488372094
2697099,5,B000KRNKOG,"Very challenging workout for the core.  I only need to do this twice per week to see results, love it!",1427068800,,102,4.1
2697100,4,B000KRNKOG,"Really good, focused work out - not too long, but long enough to make a serious difference.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because the menu says ""Abs workout 1"" and ""Abs workout 2"", but there's really only one.  The production of the whole thing seems rather cheap, but i'm still glad I got it & I do recommend it to anyone who wants some abs focus in their fitness routine.",1419897600,,371,4.211267605633803
2697101,5,B000KRNKOG,"This is a great video, and I expect my abs to show once I start eating better. #ilovejeanette",1407369600,,93,4.222222222222222
2697102,4,B000KRNKOG,She holds her poses a little too long for me but it's a great workout,1404345600,,69,3.6666666666666665
2697103,3,B000KRNKOG,"Jeanette is obviously very knowledgeable about yoga, and if it were not for the starts and stops (of the dvd's setup) this would be a great workout! However, as it is (there is no 'play all' feature) you do a 5-minute section, then it goes back to the menu for your to pick the next segment, then maybe you choose a 7-minute section, and then it takes you back to the menu. I want a flowing yoga practice, not a start and stop one...If you don't mind that, though, it would be a great workout! I did the sections and I was definitely feeling some heat.",1402444800,,552,4.216981132075472
2697104,5,B000KRNKOG,This was my first time doing yoga and I caught on pretty fast. The setting is nice and Jeanette does a great job with instructing. I think I've out grown this one already so its time to upgrade to her power yoga dvd.,1395705600,,216,4.046511627906977
2697105,4,B000KRNKOG,Works your whole core well. I do the whole thing as I think its silly to break it into parts.,1374451200,,93,3.7
2697106,5,B000KRNKOG,"I love JJ & all her videos!  This yoga video is fantastic for people who want to get a great yoga workout, but aren't into a lot of the mysticism that many yoga videos come with (funky music, lots of chanting, harnessing your chi, etc.). Its just a great workout and is fantastic for beginners and beyond!",1374105600,,305,4.350877192982456
2697107,5,B000KRNKOG,"I have never practiced yoga with Jenette Jenkins, but I really do enjoy both her personal presentation as well as the asana sequencing. For me, it's also challenging. However, it's broken up into segments if I wanted to do it that way.
I was pleasantly surprised that Jenette also brings you into the ""mindset"" of yoga practice. She suggests that you focus on an intention, for example, and brings you make to the commitment and focus of that attention later in the sequence.
I follow Adrienne and Wai Lana on WUSF, the University of Florida's public radio station, and this builds upon that material.",1372032000,,601,4.788461538461538
2697108,5,B000KRNKOG,I am a huge fan of Jeanette Jenkins' fitness workouts and this one doesnt disappoint. If you like power yoga and familiar with the flow sequence - this DVD has all the right flow movements you get attending a power class with Jeanette's amazing teaching style. Moderate to high intensity workout that will leave you sweating!,1369612800,,325,4.821428571428571
2697109,5,B000KRNKOG,"I have recently discovered Jeanette Jenkins DVDs and she is awesome!  She kicks your butt every time, this yoga dvd is no exception!  This is not just a stretch everything out yoga workout, you still feel amazing when you're done but you get a serious workout with this!",1369267200,,270,4.604166666666667
2697110,4,B000KRNKOG,"This is a very good dvd, most of the yoga I can keep up with, this is a great dvd to get you started.  I did not realize it was Power yoga, so if you are a beginner it will take a while to keep up with the workout.  But I like how you can pick and choose which parts to do.  I do this one twice a week.",1369094400,2,302,3.347826086956522
2697111,5,B000KRNKOG,"This dvd really worked for me, it was kind of expensive, but I like Ms. Jenkins. So to me she was worth it! In all, I own three of her
dvds and I like them all.",1363910400,,160,3.4722222222222223
2697112,5,B000KRNKOG,I love this workout. My VHS tape was worn out so this is really an upgrade.  The workout is challenging but it can be done daily or at a minimum every other day.  Jeannette Jenkins comes across as a very nice person and makes it very easy to follow her workout.,1361232000,,261,4.098039215686274
2697113,5,B000KRNKOG,"It's one of the few DVDs that flows beautifully, keeps my mind engaged and I finish feeling stress free but also I feel like I got a really good workout.",1360540800,,153,4.133333333333334
2697114,5,B000KRNKOG,"I love this dvd it is great, she is clear with her instructions, she is very knowledgeable and she makes u feel like u have worked hard.  the only thing is she should spend more time doing stretches. But apart from that I recommend her dvds to everyone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-Trainer-AB-Blast/dp/B000KX0COQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood Trainer / AB Blast</a>",1360022400,,428,6.781818181818182
2697115,5,B000KRNKOG,"So I'm really glad that this DVD has 6 segments, because I've never been able to do them all at once. I usually just start at the power flow sequence and go from there as that's a challenging enough of a workout for me. She also adds a few poses that are a little less typical, challenging, but not too challenging which keeps my interest up. She offers modifications for beginners, intermediate and advanced which I really like. If you are a beginner, I would make sure you have a yoga block handy for this one.",1355788800,,512,4.34375
2697116,4,B000KRNKOG,"This is my first dvd with Jeanette Jenkins as the instructor.  I have many yoga dvd's, Sarah Ivanhoe, Brian Kest, Alan Finger, Tara Stiles, Rodney Yee and Shiva Rea.  What I enjoy is that each instructor brings their own style and own favorite poses, so each is different.  I found Jeanette to be motivating but never over the top.  She knows when to let the silence be there.  Her set is soft, with clouds and orange banners the color of a sunset, with wood floors.  Understated and calming.  Though this does say Beginner to Advanced I would not have felt comfortable as a beginner with this dvd.  You need to learn the basics and factor in some modifications, and though she does instruct a few variations, some of the poses were challenging and there was little variation.  For that I would recommend that this not be your very first yoga experience.

The dvd is broken into 6 segments, Introduction (2 min.), Breathing/Warm-up & Intention (5 min.), Vinyasa flows (13 min.), Power Flows (45 min.), Floor Work (14 min.), Plough/Shoulder stance & final relaxation (7 min.).  You can do the whole program for 84 minutes or break out by chapter.  One thing I did not care for was that if you do break down the chapters the segments ends awkwardly/abruptly.  I would have liked to see a yoga matrix style where you could pick the chapters you wanted and it would flow smoothly from one to the next.  This way you finish one chapter, then have to go back and choose another.

Overall, the instruction was excellent, the cuing of both the moves and the breathing was helpful as were the recommendations of how to do the more advanced positions.  On the more beginner side, it appeared that the girl that was to be showing those modifications seem to need to be prodded to use the block and though a strap was available I didn't see any moves where it was actually used.  The music was flute/drum and was nicely done, though I felt in some portions seemed to drown her out a little.

I would definitely look at purchasing this and felt it gave me a good workout with classic poses such as chair, down dog, dolphin, half-moon, plough, warrior 1, 2 & 3, triangle and several others.  A great all over toning and conditioning work-out.",1350777600,8,2228,4.58080808080808
2697117,5,B000KRNKOG,"This is one of the best, MOST challenging yoga DVDs I've seen and I love it!  I have been training for several years and never viewed yoga as a ""real"" workout.  After having two-level, low-back fusion surgery almost two years ago, my doctor turned me on to yoga.  I thought it would be okay until I could get back to doing real workouts (running, weights, sports, etc).  I was amazed how my body responded to yoga and discovered it was indeed a great workout.  I've been a fan since!

I have a vast library (over 50) yoga dvds with a number of different instructors, my favorites being P-90X yoga, Bob Harper's Yoga for the Warrior, MTV Power Yoga, Iron Yoga...  Jeannette Jenkins is my new favorite - she kicks my butt!",1342742400,,720,4.450381679389313
2697118,5,B000KRNKOG,"This DVD is amazing! I swear I can tell the difference the very next day! Jeanette is really good at explaining each move, and doesn't go too fast. I have used this in combination with her other videos and have gotten great results! I highly recommend it. You don't need a yoga strap though and you only need one yoga block, but you don't have to have either one really.",1334275200,4,370,4.3
2697119,5,B000KRNKOG,"I was looking for a DVD I could do at home on my off days from practicing power vinyasa at a studio. Minus the heat endured at the studio, I found this DVD to be just as challenging. The fast paced vinyasas and flow of the workout are phenomenal! This DVD is definitely the next best thing to a real power yoga class and you will be sore the next day.",1327622400,,351,3.9577464788732395
2697120,5,B000KRNKOG,"This Power Yoga DVD includes three separate workouts that focus on stamina, strength and flexibility.  The workout is challenging and I recommend it highly.",1319155200,6,156,5.5
2697121,5,B000KRNKOG,"I bought this thinking it would be a stepping stone to the P90X yoga that had been giving me fits.  I think this might even be harder than the P90X yoga!  It's a really good workout though so I tough it out.  It's 84 minutes if you do the entire workout, but it's divided into sections if you just want to do one or two.  The sections are warm up, vinyasa flows, power flows, floor work (including two sets of 50 bicycle crunches), inverted poses, and a final relaxation.  I take a couple breaks here and there, and sometimes I have to come out of a pose, but I improve every time I do the workout.  I feel invigorated afterwards.  This workout, the P90X yoga, and Kristin McGee's power yoga have really made me love yoga and made me appreciate yoga's ability to improve balance, flexibility, and endurance.",1311206400,20,807,4.412162162162162
2697122,5,B000KRNKOG,"I just did this yoga video yesterday and really enjoyed it.

It has a simple outdoor setting and Jeanette Jenkins and a male and a female fellow exerciser.  The instructions are done live rather than via voiceover.

You start out with a brief description of breathing then the standing poses or vinyasas.  This section is about 33 minutes.  Then there are 2 more sections before the final relaxation.  (This is not including the warm up because I was short on time).  The last 2 sections include the ab section which includes boat pose and criss cross and is really short and the last section before relaxation is the hip openers which was about 11 minutes.  It was really easy on the joints.

This is easier than her other more recent power yoga video that was just released.  The hardest poses here for me in this video were the standing splits and the pushups which are just basically regular pushups.

There is not new age chanting or music much in this video.  It is more athletic style cuing without the sanskrit names.

Poses that are missing in this video: tree, crow, camel, bow, pigeon, pose of the dancer, and yoga squat that I recall.

Overall you can not beat this video and the workout you get for the price.  And Jeanette Jenkins as an instructor is very good!  I recommend!!!",1297900800,6,1291,4.572052401746725
2697123,3,B000KRNKOG,"I liked that she explain it nice and slow, but it is difficult for a beginner like myself.  I think this dvd should be for someone that did it before.  After the first 10 minutes I was worn out.  I think it will take a couple of trys to complete the dvd, I will keep trying until I master it.",1296000000,,292,3.8333333333333335
2697124,5,B000KRNKOG,"My wife is doing this review.
I really like this DVD.  I have been doing some beginner 20 minute Rodney Yee yoga that I really like since I am a beginner to yoga.  This DVD is something I will have to work up to.  It flows great and is a great challenge. It makes me sweat, strengthen and stretch muscles I didn't know I had. She is really good at explaining each move and breathing. Really gives me something to work at and I think it would be challenging for any level. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great yoga workout.",1295827200,,534,4.115384615384615
2697125,5,B000KRNKOG,"I love this power yoga workout, it is challenging which I appreciate so I don't get bored. I have already done this video 4 times and I learn something new each time. I really enjoy how Jeanette goes through the movements slowly so I have time to follow, yet it is still very challenging. Her verbal direction is good which allows me to follow without having to continually watch the TV screen. I really love the music . When I am done I feel energized but peaceful at the same time. My body feels like it was challenged and I get an excellent full body stretch .  This Yoga DVD is a great buy.

2697126,4,B000KRNKOG,I do this dvd about once a week as part of my abs workout. I do it on the mornings when I do not use my stability ball or kettlebell. Overall I would say the dvd is rated a five on a difficulity scale of ten.,1287014400,,208,3.5434782608695654
2697127,5,B000KRNKOG,"I love exercise and fitness but hate AB exercises because that is where I need the most work and the workouts are usually too difficult and hard on my back.  This video was surprisingly fun to do as well as made me feel like I really worked up a sweat to work my abs.  I love the end of the workout where she does reverse stretches to counteract all the ab work.  She is a great instructor, to the point and easy to watch.  I will order more of her DVD's!",1281830400,2,455,3.967032967032967

This is great for a early morning stress free start or bedtime routine. It works your entire body easily! I'm telling you a day later my entire body was sore! But with anything it's about the amount of effort you put in! Focus on form and controlled movements and breathing and this will definitely benefit you!,1483747200,,504,4.372340425531915
8158939,5,B000KRNKOG,"This is by FAR my favorite yoga work out and favorite workout DVD. You get an incredible workout by holding several poses for a considerable amount of time, and then moving quickly through several poses. If I don't do this video for just a couple weeks (and still do many other workouts) I'll be sore for a couple days (which is great!). I REALLY wish she would do another yoga DVD!!!!!
Other highlights: she's not annoying; the music isn't annoying; she doesn't try to be perfect; you don't have to do the entire DVD - there are several segments.",1483401600,2,547,4.5353535353535355
