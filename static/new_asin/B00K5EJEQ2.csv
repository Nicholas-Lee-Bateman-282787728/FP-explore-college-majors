8655984,5,B00K5EJEQ2,"I used part of this (as another reviewer did) for an activity at my daughter's 8th birthday party.  It worked out well.  They loved it.  And though it may seem cheesy (as the other reviewer said), it was fairly realistic.  I grew up in Hawaii and I know that the people there really are into ""the aloha spirit"", which is so emphasized in the video.  The video portrays and teaches six hula dances.  For one of them, you need extra materials which you likely don't have, but there are plenty that you don't need anything else. The children in the video are 6-9 years old.",1473552000,4,570,4.380952380952381
8655985,4,B00K5EJEQ2,To me the instructor sounded corny. I used a portion of the video as an activity at a birthday party for a 7 year old girl. She and her friends seemed to enjoy it.,1433289600,,163,3.823529411764706
