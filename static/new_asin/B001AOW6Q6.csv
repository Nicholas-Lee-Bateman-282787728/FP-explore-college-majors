8278447,5,B001AOW6Q6,"KINDAR THE INVULNERABLE (1965) stars Mark Forest as the title character. As a newborn, Kindar is the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, in which he shall be the indestructible savior of his people, in the city of Utor. Uh-oh! The baby is kidnapped! This is all very disturbing, as everyone involved, whether good or eeevil, is all-too eager to prove the infant's invulnerability, by trying to plunge a dagger into him! Bad parenting all the way around! Fast-forward to a chuckling, adult Kindar, still wearing some sort of diaper, smashing and stomping people for fun and relaxation! Having been raised by the devilish Seymuth, Kindar is being trained as a warrior and inheritor of his ""father's"" traveling tribe of desert marauders. Trading in the diaper for some trousers, Kindar finds that his superhuman-ness comes in quite handy in battle. Enter the beautiful, captive Utor-ian princess Nefer, given to Kindar by Seymuth. Romance soon blooms. Also, Seymuth's woman, Kira (Rosalba Neri- LADY FRANKENSTEIN, THE FRENCH SEX MURDERS, THE DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT) has had her eye on Kindar, and is jealous. Now, she's up to no good! Plus, Kindar must face his own, equally huge brother, in a fight to the death! The sand really flies, as these two smash and bang into each other like a couple of enchanted oak trees! Fortunately, Kindar is merciful. Will he discover his true identity, before Symuth leads him to destroy Utor? Will he be able to resist Kira's aggressive advances? Will he ever tire of cracking people's heads together? Let us hope...",1500163200,,1548,5.003875968992248

8278450,4,B001AOW6Q6,"One of the better ones. I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed this sword and sandal movie. Not exactly what you would expect. More like Hercules in the desert, but the story is good, the dubbing better than average, and the acting is decent. One big lesson to be learned here-- don't bring a camel to a horse fight. And those curved scimitars are lousy for all out fighting. Mark Forest is a pleasant enough actor. Well worth the watch",1470614400,2,441,4.45679012345679
