8540719,5,B009ES7DDQ,"David Gilmour is not very prolific in regards to releasing his solo work. A handful of albums and a few DVD's over the years. That being said, when he does release something, it is really something ! This double-disk DVD set features Mr. Gilmour playing solo material as well as some Pink Floyd favorites. While he has an outstanding band and allows them all plenty of room, it is his guitar that is prominent, and boy-oh-boy does he strut his stuff !! Watch this and you will know why many call him the best guitar player in rock.
Disk one is comprised of two sets from Royal Albert Hall. Disk two is some additional Royal Albert Hall material, as well as other works from various locations and some behind-the-scenes stuff. The late Richard Wright is featured on a version of Comfortably Numb on the second disk, and is one of the many highlights. The solo in Comfortably Numb has been called the best guitar solo in rock history, and Gilmour proves it by absolutely crushes this one.
