8482121,1,B000WC8C38,"Sonya is a nice and talented coach, but this DVD is a waste of time.  1/3 of the DVD is stretching that you can find anywhere. Then there is a very short drills section.  And rest of the DVD is some dudes talking to you about random opinions.  This is not a good skating DVD, this is an appendix section.  Don't waste your time.",1438732800,,328,4.078125
