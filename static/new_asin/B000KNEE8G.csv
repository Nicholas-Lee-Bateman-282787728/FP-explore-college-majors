8158335,2,B000KNEE8G,"I agree with the other reviewer when they said there's not much info on this DVD. It doesn't even show how to fire the clay with a torch (which most people do), only a kiln. It shows beautiful jewelry on the cover which is very deceiving because the DVD doesn't include instructions on how to make these pieces!
Complete waste of money.",1318636800,3,336,4.435483870967742
8158336,2,B000KNEE8G,I get almost as much info free from youtube or browsing free articles. I suppose it is great for someone that knows nothing yet. I was disappointed.,1276214400,2,148,4.518518518518518
