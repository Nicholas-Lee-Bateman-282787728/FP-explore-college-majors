8090186,1,B000BOH9AY,"Invader Zim is a fantastic cartoon series about a hapless alien doing his bumbling best to conquer Earth. Unbeknownst to Zim, he was sent here by his leaders to get him out of the way of their real invasion, Operation: Impending Doom 2 (Zim single-handedly spoiled Impending Doom 1). He's accompanied by a loopily-unhinged, defective robot named GIR, who is by far the most hilarious character in the series. Zim goes undercover as a human boy, and is suspected only by his classmate, Dib, a conspiracy nutjob dismissed by everyone (even other conspiracy nutjobs, lol). Suffice it to say, mayhem ensues, but the Earth remains unconquered.

Sadly, this series was cancelled by Nickelodeon before its time (the quirky humor isn't exactly what you'd expect from them, anyway). It's one of the most creative, entertaining and hysterical cartoons I've ever seen, and remains fall-off-your-chair funny, even with repeat viewings, which is probably why the cult of Zim continues to grow...

HOWEVER: Despite what the product description says, this set is NOT a boxed set! It's nothing more than the 3 individual volumes wrapped together in plain cellophane. If you're looking for the complete series, but want something less expensive than the slightly pricey (but-worth-it-if-you're-a-Zim-fanatic) House Box Complete Set, save your dough and buy Volumes 1/2/3 separately- you'll get the exact same material as this Invader Zim 3-Pack ""boxed set"" for substantially less money.",1134345600,30,1469,5.327586206896552
