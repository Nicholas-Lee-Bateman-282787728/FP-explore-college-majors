2052327,5,B00020HCBI,great box set but f you really want it go to highlander web site and buy it for 39.95 a set all 6 for 240.00 plus the box to put them in for only $1.00,1105315200,4,151,3.342857142857143
2052328,3,B00020HCBI,"THIS IS THE LAST AND FINAL SEASON OF HIGLANDER THE SERIES.  AT THE START IN CONCLUDES MACLEODS BATTLE WITH THE ZOROASTRIAN DEMON AHRIMAN.  BUT THEN IT TOOK A WHOPPING FALL AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ADRIAN PAUL SHOULD HAVE HAD HIS NAME ON THE GUEST STAR LIST.  IN FACT HE DOESN'T EVEN APPEAR IN 2 EPISODES.  IT WAS CLEARLY EVIDENT WHAT THE DUMB PRODUCERS OF HIGHLANDER WERE TRYING TO DO.  WITH THE SUCCESSFUL MARKETING ON THE FEMALE ACTION HEROINE-""XENA THE WARRIOR PRINCESS"" THE PRODUCERS AUDITIONED 5 MEDIOCRE FEMALE IMMORTALS THAT COULD REPLACE ADRIAN PAUL SINCE THIS WAS CLEARLY THE FINAL SEASON OF HIGHLADER.  ALL OF THEM HOWEVER, FAILED MISERABLY(THE WORST BEING CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN OF ""BAYLON 5"" STARDOM & SANDRA HESS) AND STAINED THE HIGHLADER FRANCHISE THAT I DONT THINK IT WILL EVER BE ABLE TO RECOVER. THE PRODUCERS ARE TRULY TO BLAME FOR THIS OUTRAEOUS SEASON THAT WE RECEIVED.  ALL OF THE NEW FEMALE LEADS HAD NO KIND OF SWORDSMANSHIP EXPERTISE, CAME NO WHERE CLOSE TO ADRIAN PLAUL'S MARTIAL ARTS ABILITY AND SWORDSMANSHIP AND ACTED ATROCIAOUSLY.  ON THE PLUS SIDE WE DO GET A FEW GOOD EPISODES WHERE MACLEOD TAKES UP HIS KATANA AND BATTLES THE FORCES OF DARKNESS

EPISODS:

AVATAR

ARMAGEDDON

SINS OF THE FATHER

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY

BLACK TOWER

INDISCRETIONS

TO BE

NOT TO BE

ARE SOME OF THE GOOD EPISODES YOU GET.  AGAIN, THIS SEASON CONSISTED OF ONLY 13 EPISODES.  IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT JUST TO COMPLETE YOUR HIGHLANDER COLLECTION THEN I RECOMMEND IT.  BUT THATS ALL IT CLEARLY STANDS OUT AS.  A BRAVE ATTEMPT BY THE PRODUCERS TO CREATE A SPINOFF TV. SERIES THAT FAILS MISERABLY.",1103932800,2,1595,4.808118081180812
2052329,3,B00020HCBI,"Although this season provides a nice ending to the series in the form of the two-part final episode - which is really a sort of It's a Wonderfull life-like reflection of the entire series, by and large this season was used as a ""proving ground"" for the female lead character they were looking for to headline the series ""The Raven"".

So a good number of the episodes in this half-season were taken up focusing on various other immortals.  Not that that was such a bad thing as by-and-large I think they were decent episodes, but Duncan really isn't in them much, if at all.  In fact, in the extras on the DVDs that's one of the things mentioned frequently - that Adrian Paul wasn't as available this season as he had been before - that he wanted to bring the series to a close for whatever reason, etc.

All that being said, this is still a somewhat important season in the series as Duncan comes to terms with his actions in previous seasons - the killing by his own hands - and the character goes through an important transition.  For that reason alone, you might want to consider this season.  Even still, when standing this season up against seasons 2,3 and 4, this one pales in comparison.",1100822400,45,1194,4.47926267281106

It seemed rushed and in too much of a hurry to tie up lose ends. I LOVE the series and star Adrian Paul but it needed a more dignified end. Still not quite sure if he lived or died in the end but he went on to make more Highlander movies. Just a bit disappointed that the last season of such a great tv show would feel so incomplete.

2052378,2,B00020HCBI,"This last season was extremely different from any other season.  Okay so as a female, I do prefer Adrian Paul and some of the episodes did not have him in them at all. I think they should have either stopped with season 5 or continued the theme that they had started in the previous seasons, depicting the life of the ""Highlander, Duncan MacLeod"" not other immortals only.  The story line for the final couple episodes were very forced. As with the ending of Season 5 if you just want to finish the series it is something to watch (kind of like getting 3/4 of the way through a book and forcing yourself to finish).",1394755200,,615,4.385964912280702

What I really like about this season is they dedicate an hour each to of lots of new immortals

I was surprised to see that there were some without the main character Duncan Macleod, however it did give you the opportunity to see the beginings of some of the other key charcters.. Thanks for the entertainment..",1231545600,,340,4.573770491803279
2052417,3,B00020HCBI,"This season was really not necessary! They should have extended season five to include the first and last two episodes of this season. These were the only episodes relevent to the Highlander story. The first two episodes conclude the story that ended season five with Duncan fighting the demon Ariman and killing Ritchie in the process. The last two episodes were the series finale. The rest of the episodes focus on various new characters and their stories. Duncan MacCleod was barely in any of them and only played minor roles. There were one or two episodes that he wasn't even in! It seems to me that the producers were introducing new characters in search of a spin-off, which ended up being the ill-fated Highlander The Raven. Although Amanda was a great character, she couldn't carry an entire series. Still, it's worth having this season to complete your collection and the episodes that focus on other characters are entertaining nontheless.",1208995200,2,950,4.981132075471698
2052418,3,B00020HCBI,"Season 6 of Highlander was easily the weakest of the seasons BUT it does have its moments.

Let me say that the first two episodes ""Avatar"" and ""Armaggedon"" did not fit the Highlander world at all though I can respect what they were trying to do. Have the immortal scottsman Duncan Macleod face off with the ULTIMATE immortal Arimon (aka Satan to me).

As a man who was brought up in a Christian home, that part of me could appreciate what it was trying to do. Have Duncan defeat the ultimate evil but how without using his usual weapons (his military experience, martial arts, his famous dragon-head Katana sword)? As a Highlander fan, it just didn't fit into this world at all. I know its science-fiction but its Sci-Fi that's grounded in reality. This one went more to the left than usual.

As for the rest of the season, most of the episodes were average at best though I did like ""Unusual Suspects"" (a comedy episode with Roger Daltry) and the one where its just Methos and Joe Dawson in an episode.

The reason to get this season at all is the final two episodes called ""To Be..."" and ""Or Not To Be"". They, at least, let Highlander: The Series end on a high note. Otherwise, its pretty much a ""casting call"" for female actors for the eventual spin-off Highlander: The Raven. I've never seen it so I won't comment on it but most slam it as bad!

Back to this season, it isn't a total waste of money but I wouldn't pay no more than $30 for it! Anything past that is robbery for this season!",1200614400,3,1494,4.379061371841155

But some of the female leads, who were in fact auditioning for the spin-off, were quite beautiful and also had fun stories. I guess I wish we had seen more of Amanda in this season still playing off Duncan.
Overall, I deduct for the season being too little about the traditional characters, even though apart from that the stories were better than average for TV.",1193356800,,580,4.481132075471698

And being too an autoracing buff, for me it was a positive surprise that they had included the feature of ""La carrera Panamericana"", Adrian Paul is not a great driver but it was interesting to watch how a team is readied for a race and it was exciting to follow the teams thru all Mexico.

The quality of the Highlander DVD box sets is a delight through all six releases. Season Six is no exception and contains the same unique special features and great video transfer as the rest. My one major turn off that, unfortunately, seems to be an industry standard is the folding package that takes up the whole coffee table. It doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the series or the special features which were enough in the first two seasons two make me buy the rest, at a premium for my impatience, from the official site ([...]  The entire series is now packaged in a box set and priced low enough for anyone to own.  Truthfully, it is comparable to one season of Star Trek The Next Generation and has fewer flaws throughout than the first two seasons of that show.

Actually, season 6 is just plain short. With only 13 episodes, and even fewer with Duncan in it I find myself loving it much more now that I have it on DVD. When it originally aired I was confused as to why it had so little of it's lead character, but now I understand that they were looking for a spin-off character. Although none of those spin-off ideas worked it is still fun to watch these episodes. Also, the series finale is absolutely amazing! It brings back all of the favorite characters, and it really made me stop and think, `hum, I wonder what that would have been like'.

Episodes 1 & 2:  The first two episodes could be considered concluding chapters of Season five's finale.

In the middle of season six we get an entire episode of Roger Daltrey and Adrian Paul in a comedic period piece.

Episode 11:  A wonderful episode centering on Joe and Methos sure to delight the fans who yearn for more screen time for this duo.

Episodes 12 & 13: The final two episodes:  To Be and Not To Be provide an opportunity for most of the stars of the series one last reunion.

The Bad:

Episodes 3 thru 10:  Unbeknownst to fans (or at least most of us) at the time, Season six was being utilized in large part as a spin-off proving ground for what would later become The Raven.  This would not be under the heading of ""bad"" had they used these episodes to showcase the wonderful Elizabeth Gracen as Amanda.  Unfortunately what we have here are several episodes with few, if any, appearances by series regulars, and storylines that involve actresses at one time thought be contenders for Gracen's role in The Raven.

The Bizarre:

Fans of the underdogs celebrate!  But wait!  Not yet!  At long last fan favorites Elizabeth Gracen and Peter Wingfield are included in the opening credits.  But sadly, that's about all you will see of them until episodes 11-13 of the 13 episodes in season six!  I had hoped that in the bonus material of this final season we would learn why this happened.  Alas, there was no mention of this oddity.  There was also no mention about what led to Elizabeth Gracen being cast as The Raven and why they wasted all the mid-season episodes on guest stars.  Perhaps that will be explained in The Raven on DVD?

The Bottom Line:

It's a half-good, half-bad season mainly due to the lack of series regulars in the middle of the season.  I think the missed opportunity here was failing to utilize Byrnes, Gracen and Wingfield in episodes that went to unknown guest stars.  If you already own the first five seasons, you owe it to yourself to complete your collection and revisit the lore of Highlander's final season.  Here's hoping for a new Highlander movie starring all of our favorite series regulars!",1114473600,11,2152,4.6094986807387865
2052430,5,B00020HCBI,"The first two episodes, ""Avatar"" and ""Armageddon"" were integral to the plot as they pretty much presented the ""ending"" to Highlander.  In ""Armageddon,"" MacLeod's rivalry was intensified.  Moreover, with the help of Father Beaufort and Joe Dawson, MacLeod begins to find a crack in Evil's armor.  However, they soon learn that anyone who helps the Champion becomes fair game for the demon.  This was one of my favorite episodes from the final Season because the characters had to struggle with guilt as they came to face their own demons.  The highlighted scene belonged to MacLeod's wrestles with Ahriman in the final battle.  For the remaining episodes, the writers presented glimpses of how MacLeod's friends and lovers would have been without him.
Although Season 6 offered fewer episodes, the bonus video interviews with various behind-the-scenes were such special treats.  In addition, several episodes have audio and video commentaries that allow the viewers to get a better understand of the show's plot and production.

2052431,5,B00020HCBI,"There are alot of series out there that were great and you got to grow with the characters. Highlander was one of the greatest. You started off with the movies then went on to the tv sereis which besides Highlander 1 and Endgame, was what made highlander so famous and so great. To watch Duncan go from just a normal immortal to the greatest of all immortals and to have his character grow is what made the series so fundamental. I was sadden to see the last season because I knew that it was going to end. Season 6 had a lot of great points to it and alot of points that i didn't like becuase there were episodes that did not contain the characters that everyone grew to love. Although it has some upsets it was still a great and immotional season. Highlander is still the best out there and can't wait to see if there is going to be any more.",1114128000,2,844,4.184049079754601
2052442,5,B00020HCBI,"Season six of Highlander the series was a short, but sweet 12 episodes. This season is also a little short on my favorite Immortal, Duncan MacLeod. There are four episodes, `Sins of the Father', `Patient Number 7', `Justice', and `Two Hearts', where the powers that be tested the water for a female lead spin-off (which was eventually the Immortal Amanda as the Raven) also, there are a few episodes with just a little bit of Duncan, or a mention that Duncan is in London while Methos and Joe take the lead (not that I think this is a bad thing). There is also an appearance of the Immortal Huge Fitzcairn (Roger Daltrey) in this season, and as usual he steals the show with his great comedic timing!

These episodes, with the exception of the before mentioned details, are very well written and the acting is great. I really have enjoyed re-watching these episodes (as I'd only seen them once before). The extras are very entertaining to me; I really enjoy getting to see the behind the scene stuff and I love to hear what the stars and production people have to say about working on episodes that I enjoy so much.

All in all I think this is a perfect DVD box set, it's a great one to own, and I recommend it for anyone who likes a good action/sci-fi/comedy/drama type flick!",1113955200,,1277,4.5
2052443,4,B00020HCBI,"While I have to agree with the other reviews that this is not your typical Highlander season, the chance to see Claudia Christian as an immortal worthy of her own series is enough to make this season well worth picking up!

And for those not overly fond of the price, do as I did and surf over to the Legendary Heroes website where you can get the season at a much lower price.

While the bonus features may not equal those of previous season in the eyes of others they do have a tremendous amount packed into a season with half as many episodes as most...

As a completionist there was never any question for me of whether or not season 6 would sit alongside seasons 1-5.  However, looking to the strengths of the season, rather that the weaknesses has me eagerly awaiting my season 6 arriving in the mail.  (And as I've said before, the Claudia Christian ep alone is enough to make this season worthwhile for me.)",1113868800,,1984,5.058461538461539
2052444,2,B00020HCBI,"If this set had cost $29.99 and contained only three or four discs, I wouldn't feel nearly as cheated.  The commentaries introducing the episodes were repetitive and mainly lamented the scarcity of Adrian Paul.  Since the introductory commentaries had been one of the best parts of the previous five seasons' DVDs, this is a major drawback.

The episodes auditioning a format for RAVEN weren't that bad in and of themselves, but they weren't HIGHLANDER.  The finale was good and pulled together the best threads of the previous seasons (I would have liked Xavier St Cloud included, but still...)

I was also disappointed that, though Elizabeth and Peter were featured in the opening credits of the sixth season, there weren't Methos and/or Amanda centered episodes, except for the Joe & Methos one.

There were 4 discs that contained NOTHING that couldn't have been added to the first 4.  Only for people who really have to have the completes series.",1113091200,3,950,4.974683544303797
2052445,3,B00020HCBI,"Highlander, which is one of my favorite collections, was tainted with the last season. Out of the 13 episodes, Adrain Paul makes himself scarce, if in the episode at all.  The only three worth the price was the series finale (last two episodes) and seeing Methos once again.  Otherwise, save yourself the money and just get the series finale ""To Be"" and ""Not To Be"".  The last three discs are all extras with a great many things that were already seen on the previous 5 seasons.",1108684800,20,478,4.534883720930233
2052446,1,B00020HCBI,"The only episodes worth watching are the last two parter that ended the series.  The other episodes, which is a set up for the series ""The Raven"" were average at best.  I think the price for this set is not worth it.

I believe the Series Finale is available as a separate DVD. This would be a better choice.",1108339200,3,308,4.186440677966102
2052447,3,B00020HCBI,"For ""Highlander"" fans everywhere, season six was a major disappointment.  It started out bad, and it didn't get much better.

Picking up where season five left off, the finale season of the series begins with ""Avatar"", which has got to be one of the worst episodes of the show.  When you see Duncan cover his ears and go berserk at the sound of rock music, then rip the stereo out of the car, all for no apparent reason - you know you're in trouble.  Luckily for us, the 5,000-year-old Zoroastrian space demon behind these horrible episodes went poof in the next episode, ""Armageddon"".  One of the biggest problems with season six is that half the episodes are used as ""backdoor pilots"" for a spin-off show - that is, episodes that use MacLeod for as little as thirty seconds and which feature a female immortal as the main character.  The episodes which do star MacLeod suffer from horrible writing, namely ""Black Tower"", which is probably the worst episode of the whole show.

Season six did have a few good moments, though.  The first of these was ""Justice"", an Agatha Christie-ish flashback episode in which Duncan sets out to find the culprit behind the ""murder"" of Hugh Fitzcairn (played by Roger Daltrey).  Then there's ""Indiscretions"", in which everyone's favorite buddies, Joe and Methos, finally get their own episode.  The greatest part of the season however was the two-episode finale, ""To Be"" and ""Not to Be"", which draws obvious inspiration from Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"".

Well, maybe if Adrian Paul hadn't had his hair cut for this season, the show might have ended better.  Then again, maybe he wouldn't have received his paycheck and the show wouldn't have ended at all.  Which still might be better than this.

Season six is strictly for die-hard fans of the show, or those looking to complete their ""Highlander"" collection.  It's an astonishingly bad season and an unfitting demise to a great show.",1107993600,20,1930,4.841463414634147
2052448,2,B00020HCBI,"This stands to be my least favorite of all the seasons. If I were to only ever watch one episode and it was from this season, it would turn me away from the show. Adrian Paul has a very small part to play in most of the episodes. He is responsible for making the show as good as it was. The female actresses starred on this final season leave much to be desired. The biggest turn-off for this season, is all of the gunplay which occurs. It reminds me of the sensless exslosion and shoot-em hour long shows which were popular in the '80's. This lacking in the prior seasons is what attracted me to the show initially. I appreciated the Highlander's spirituality and how the show distinguished itself within the action/adventure genre. Fortunately, I picked this up for 39.99 and free shipping on the highlander website. It makes a nice completion to my dvd sets and there are a couple of good episodes, but this is not the place to start if you are unfamiliar with the highlander show. 4,3,2,5 are the best.",1107907200,2,1006,4.4728260869565215
2052449,5,B00020HCBI,"Highlander... There can be only one. Watching through the whole season 6 dvd collection, fans of the show are given an ending to a show that we've followed for many years.  This dvd collection offers 13 episodes and extras including never-before-seen footage of deleted and alternate scenes as well as recently discovered footage.  In AVATAR, the sword fighting is back again with more action from Duncan.  In ARMAGEDDON, the final battle is well-deserved and the photo gallery captures the moments.  In SINS OF THE FATHER, Dara Tomanovich adds to the story of danger and a promise to fulfill.  In DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY, writer James Thorpe once again provides a plot of flashbacks and wishful thinking.  In PATIENT NUMBER 7, Kyra gives Duncan a run for his time and I love the way she interacts with him.  In BLACK TOWER, the story weakens and is one of my least liked episodes.  In UNUSUAL SUSPECTS, JUSTICE, DEADLY EXPOSURE, and TWO OF HEARTS, the stories are too predictable, but the fightings are still good.  For INDISCRETION, the scripts on the CD-ROM will give you a better understand of the whole episode if you got lost in it as I did.  In TO BE, Adrian Paul gives one of his best performances in the final series.  As for NOT TO BE, it seemed too brief of an episode to give what the fans really needed as an end to all.  Overall, I suggest you to watch all the featurettes and listen to the audio commentaries.

The complete sixth season of the television series contains episodes that fans should not miss.  It has a lot of extra DVD features and they are what make this collection special.  The features that I loved the most were Watcher Chronicles, Interview with Adrian Paul, and Immortal Memories.  This is one DVD collection that has more features than a fan can really watch.  There are a total of 13 episodes and each one is action-packed.  I like the episodes with Adrian Paul in it, but the ones with his absence left me a little lost.

2052451,5,B00020HCBI,"The Highlander TV Show debuted well over a decade ago, and since then it has been embraced by fans across the world.  The audience views the wicked world of Immortals through the eyes of Duncan MacLeod, who is played by Adrian Paul.  Many of us have read stories about Mortal and Immortal in schools, but never really contemplated on the issue of life vs. death and staying vs. continuing.  These are the themes depicted in Highlander and they are what caught my attention when I first started watching the show.

Season 6 once again built upon these themes and used the concepts to develop the characters even further.  As the Highlander TV Series ended with Season 6, the storyline was tied with much passion, sadness, action, and emotion.  This Season started with MacLeod finally defeated Ahriman, a demonic presence that confused MacLeod to the point of accidentally killing Richie Ryan at the end of Season 5.  Like its regulars, MacLeod fought off others with his swords for his life.  Although these fights lacked the strength of choreograph as in previous Seasons, they were still very entertaining.

The first two episodes, ""Avatar"" and ""Armageddon"" were integral to the plot as they pretty much presented the ""ending"" to Highlander.  In ""Armageddon,"" MacLeod's rivalry was intensified.  Moreover, with the help of Father Beaufort and Joe Dawson, MacLeod begins to find a crack in Evil's armor.
