8038518,2,B000646LSU,"I love this version, but since I have every vhs tape that was made, I didn't know this was something I already had.  All this is, is just the 3 part judgment episodes you can find from the vhs. if you have vhs tapes, then you don't need this.",1428969600,,242,3.938775510204082
8038519,5,B000646LSU,"I live in the UK and only the first few episodes of the series were put onto DVD so for me this was a great buy.

The only thing I can find at fault with the DVD is the fact that they used two different versons of spelling the title on the DVD: Final Judgment and Final Judgement.

I don't know if anyone else noticed but on the last episode 'Final Judgement' if you pause it and look closely at the magic circle underneath Sakura after she says the words ""O Staff of Clow guide my actions now"" it is her magic circle not Clow Reed's magic circle.",1286409600,,547,4.055555555555555
8038520,5,B000646LSU,"I was 8 when I first started watching Cardcaptors. Now I am 16-years-old.
I bought this DVD 'cause ""The Final Judgement"" (parts 1,2,3) were the most interesting episodes in the series. As I watch it again, I am brought back to the excitement of the season finale. If you remember watching Cardcaptors on Kids WB, then I highly recommend getting this DVD. You're sure to love it!!",1231632000,,379,4.6716417910447765
8038521,4,B000646LSU,"This DVD containing the final three episodes of Clow Card Season, will bring you back to the excitement when you first saw the Final Judgement.  The DVD contains two versions of those episodes; namely, English version and French version.  The English version is the infamouslly cut-and-edited North Amerian version, and the French version is conversely the excellent dub maintaining the original length and even background music, which is entitled ""Sakura Chasseuse de Cartes.""  I rated it by four stars because of the French version included in the DVD.",1149724800,2,554,5.2727272727272725
8038522,2,B000646LSU,"I would definitly buy the un-cut japenese verison instead because in this video they cut alot of senes out so it doesnt really make sense...but i love cardcaptors!! best show in the world, but just make sure u buy the uncut videos",1145836800,2,230,4.5
