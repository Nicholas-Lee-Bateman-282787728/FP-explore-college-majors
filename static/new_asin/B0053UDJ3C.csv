8455748,5,B0053UDJ3C,"I enjoy all of the Virtual Active DVDs. This one is no exception. I got it because I've always wanted to experienced hiking the Swiss Alps, but that's probably not going to happen. On the other hand, it's a great way to sample an area before going there in person. The 'coaching' is pleasant and motivating. The DVD is well done.",1388448000,2,329,4.409836065573771
