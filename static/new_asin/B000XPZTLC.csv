8229075,5,B000XPZTLC,"As a former 50 plus years member, I can say the LDS Mormon religion is totally FALSE and the teachers are taught regularly to brainwash children and new members little by little. Go to ANY of their churches worldwide and you'll see them get up to the pulpit and repeat ""I KNOW the church is true and Joseph Smith was a true prophet"". It's almost a hypnotic trance. Perhaps you'll hear them sign their favorite song about FALSE prophet, Joseph Smith-""Praise to the Man"". You will NEVER see a cross on or in any of their temples. And should you have the misfortune to  have your child join them and get married, you as a parent, will NOT be allowed to attend  your OWN CHILD'S wedding, if you do not become a member and be JUDGED by your bishop to get a recommend of you worthiness! Brigham Young stated NO ONE will get to heaven WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF JOSEPH SMITH! There are none so blind as he who WILL NOT see!",1292803200,3,912,4.296511627906977
