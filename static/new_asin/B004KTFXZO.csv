While it had some historical facts I found that the main character had reprehensible behavior. The product arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged, but due to the content we wish we had never purchased it.",1374192000,,352,4.515625
8433397,3,B004KTFXZO,"Really a feeble attempt to illustrate the character of Nelson, which really falls a little flat. I have his biography and the element of Nelson was his brilliance as a leader in the days of the fighting ships of sail. This merely portrays him as someone who seems slightly off in some distant land of his own (imagination) !! Lady Hamilton is also rather ""sad,"" and overall would not recommend this as something that is a big contributor to an historic biography. Okay to watch, but did not hold my attention entirely and I sort of skimmed through some parts !!",1323388800,,561,4.564356435643564
