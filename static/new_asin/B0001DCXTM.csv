1989816,5,B0001DCXTM,"I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old who both love this DVD.  The poses are simple enough for my three year old to do, but challenging enough to interest her.  My one year old isn't ready to activly participate but loves to look at the interesting animals, people and pictures.  This is not only good for getting kids off the couch, it also helps to reinforce thier ABC's in an exciting way.",1121817600,4,391,4.118421052631579
1989817,4,B0001DCXTM,"I bought this DVD for my daughter.  I sometimes feel like I don't know how to play or interact with her, so I use this video as a time to play with her a be silly.  It is fun.  Although she is not able to do most of the poses yet, she love that I am on her level groweling, flying, quacking, rocking.  Its great Mommy-daughter time for me, and it also good exersise.  I don't care for the nanaste song so I just push the forward button and go to the next letter. I let my friend borrow the video and her kid are about 5 and 6 and they thought it was dumb.",1118188800,2,555,3.791304347826087
1989818,5,B0001DCXTM,"My almost 2 year olds daughter and I do this 3 mornings a week at least and really enjoy it! It is just the right amount of ""Yoga"" mixed with other fun things to keep both her and I intersted! It has good poses, not to fast- not to slow-JUST RIGHT!!! It feels good for us both and gets us ready for the day. I like the OM and Namaste words and the teacher is nice, mellow and friendly seeming so I give this DVD 5 stars because we have tried others that were not so great and this is a overall good DVD for Yogis of all ages!!! ENJOY! :)",1113868800,53,537,3.8468468468468466
1989819,5,B0001DCXTM,"This is the one. Don't bother withthe first Yogakids DVD. After we got this for our three and a half year old and she fell in love with it, I purchased the first Yogakids and she was disappointed that it wasn't as good as this one. The production values are higher on this tape and it's just an all around better program. Our daughter follows along and always asks to ""Do my yoga!"" I certainly feel better about letting her watch TV when she's being active as well. Warning parents - I did the whole thing with her a few times and was so sore! There are a few moves in there that are suprisingly difficult...but we've both gotten beter at them over the past few months. Definitely a good pick for a kid who can't sit still. Also - the ""N is for Namaste"" song is a little weird and hippy dippy - my husband is always rolling his eyes...but these are the kinds of things the little ones love!",1113264000,16,890,4.2105263157894735
1989820,3,B0001DCXTM,"I bought Yogakids because I wanted to find my kids an exercise/stretching video, and the DVD cover touts it as being educational, creative, and mentions the awards it's won. I was hesitant at first to be doing ""yoga"" because I am not interested in my 3-year-old kids learning about the ""New Age"" or eastern religion-association. We are a Christian family. But on the DVD cover, this one seemed harmless.

I liked it for the most part except for the ""Om"" and ""Namaste"" segment. I suppose, obviously, being a Christian this should bother me and perhaps I shouldn't have bought it in the first place. But again, like I said, the DVD cover did not sound like it was going to be new-age at all. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting it to be religious. I guess I was expecting it to be completely devoid of any new-age or other-religion association. And except for those two segments, it wasn't really new-agey. But those two were enough for me to get rid of it. Sorry,  I know I am offending every Yoga enthusiast here but I wish this video could have come up with animals or other objects instead of the ""Om"" meditation practice. That was a little over-the-top for me. I guess those things are central to yoga, so again, I should have been wiser about considering this if I did not want to go there, but I didn't know the children would be meditating, honestly.

If that doesn't bother you, this is a great video to do with your kids. I liked everything else about it and I really, really wish I could keep it. But for our family, it is not a good fit.",1107302400,29,1550,4.4125874125874125
1989821,5,B0001DCXTM,"I bought this yoga dvd after reading the reviews above and really liked it.  I was looking for an exercise video my daughter and I could do together and this one fits the bill.  I am not in very good shape, so this video is right at my level.  It is excellent for stretching out the muscles in my back that get tight from carrying small children around.  As an added plus, my two and a half year old daughter loves it and wants to watch it almost every day, so I now exercise regularly.  I have never done yoga before, but I didn't have a problem with understanding anything on the tape.

This video has one yoga move for each of the letters of the alphabet, for example 'A' is for alligator.  I like the alphabet format because, unlike other exercise videos, I know how much longer I have until I am done :) The video has a good pace and I don't get bored doing it.  Some yoga can get a little too new age for me, but this video doesn't have that issue.  I'm glad I bought it.",1103760000,30,977,4.0732984293193715
1989822,5,B0001DCXTM,I have a very active 4 year old who absolutely loves doing Yoga Kids.  I have noticed a change in her behavior when she does Yoga Kids.  She is calmer and more focused.  Plus her dad and I get a good workout too from doing it with her.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to give their child a healthy start in life.,1102377600,24,331,3.9696969696969697
1989823,5,B0001DCXTM,"my daughter is 2 and absolutely adores this DVD. We already have and love ""Yoga for the Kid in All of Us"" (also recommended) and I wanted to get her another ""yoga show"" to expand her repetoire. If you found Yoga for the Kid... a little silly at times, then you will love this one. It is not dumbed down at all, but very pleasant and intelligent for parents and children. The instructor is calm, yet upbeat and does not talk ""down"" to the kids or use a sing -song voice (this is a huge pet peeve of mine- I cannot stand the dumbed down tone of most kids videos). I enjoy this one a lot. She goes through a different pose or excersize for each letter of the alphabet, usually an animal or object a child is familiar with. her explanation for ""Om"" (for the letter O) is very good, and the Namaste song for N is quite lovely and we hum it all day after we see the DVD.",1078617600,121,864,4.058479532163743

1989829,5,B0001DCXTM,My 3 year old enjoys doing this and asks for it. It's good when you have a long period of bad weather and the kids are full of energy. Some movements are too hard for her but she's only 3 and doesn't mind.,1455148800,,205,3.7906976744186047

1989842,4,B0001DCXTM,"This video is good at using animals and things like hot air balloons or volcanos etc. for children to mimic as poses.
My 3 year old is hardly engaged, the 4 year old somewhat and the two 6 year olds love it.  Something I would change
is to add a couple of deep breaths between poses.  Also to group several sitting poses then several standing poses, etc.
The video moves so fast between poses the children hardly have time to change from sitting to standing or standing to lying down.",1424304000,,484,4.366666666666666
1989843,1,B0001DCXTM,"Not a good fit for our kids (2 and 4 years old). The video goes very quickly. The moves are often not yoga based. It is not a flow style video. The background music is not kid friendly. We enjoy the Namaste Kid videos much better, where it is a flow or ""adventure"" based.

Kids are shown in the video which is a complaint some people have about the Namaste Kid videos.",1423440000,,368,4.111111111111111

1989848,5,B0001DCXTM,"My daughter recently turned 7 and still asks to watch this DVD. It's broken up into nice kid-sized chunks (think Sesame Street) that keep it moving along. The kids in the video are fun to watch and demonstrate that the poses don't have to be perfect! Marsha is the right combination of calming and energetic. We've had this DVD for many years (before my daughter was born, for her older brother) and I'm glad we're still using it.",1415923200,,430,4.5256410256410255

1989853,3,B0001DCXTM,This has more New Age teaching in it than I would have expected.  I know it's yoga but it is also for children... It is also a little long for a 3-4 year old's attention span.

1989859,2,B0001DCXTM,There are YouTube videos out there that are more engaging. I was really disappointed with this video. Try something different.,1398384000,,126,5.35
1989860,2,B0001DCXTM,My two year old loves yoga but this DVD didn't hold her attention. Most of the moves involve writhing around on the floor which is not comfortable even with a mat on wood floors.,1397520000,,178,4.264705882352941
1989861,4,B0001DCXTM,I bought this in hopes of my children becoming interested in Yoga.  Nope.  I played it through the first time and they lost interest quite quickly.  I gave it 4 stars because the problem could be my children.,1396396800,,208,4.421052631578948
1989862,4,B0001DCXTM,"I think this is a good dvd. It's strength is that the activities are pretty active. Unlike the first dvd though, I didn't think there was as much yoga in it. My son is a big fan of the first one and enjoys this one but not as much. However, I don't think this is a reflection of the dvd, more my son's inclination. If you want a yoga dvd the first one is more for you. If you want a dvd that provides a physical outlet and some creativity with some yoga ideas in it, this dvd will work for you.",1389312000,3,494,3.8529411764705883

1989864,3,B0001DCXTM,"We like these videos, but they definitely feel a little dated and the hostess was a bit odd. I know Yoga has a certain following, but I think it's mainstream enough now that a mainstream video should be produced. My 2 year old son is quite active and he was able to watch about 10 minutes the first viewing, but only a few minutes each thereafter. The camera does capture the yoga moves quite well, but it's a little too out there for my tastes.",1386201600,,445,4.247058823529412
1989865,5,B0001DCXTM,"I do basic yoga in my spare time and my almost 3 year old son is always trying to mimic me, but most of the time it is too difficult for him. So happy I stumbled upon this dvd! It is great and keeps his attention (which is rare for him) and gets his crazy toddler energy out. There are a few moves he can't do just yet, but for the most part it is fairly easy for him to follow. Two added pluses are it also helps with promote learning the alphabet and its great for adults too! I love doing this with him, great stretches (some moves even leave me a little sore!)

It's a nice calm workout! The kids were entranced, giggled, and had a great time. When the video was over we were all a little sweaty and my 5 year old told me he was pretty tired. It was everything that I wanted. They have asked to do it again several times already.

I will say it was a bit heavy on the ""hippie"" stuff for my taste, but again, it IS yoga so it's not really a surprise... i just would have preferred to not have that kind of thing in a video for my kids.",1366588800,,645,3.9236641221374047

Also, the Namaste song as well as the letter ""O"" standing for ""Om"" (followed by children chanting ""Om"") was over the top for us.  I will say, though, that Om was the only thing yoga about it.  There were very few actual yoga poses.  Instead, the leader flopped around like a caterpillar and butterfly.  My daughter actually much prefers doing my yoga videos with me - Rodney Yee and some prenatal videos.  Maybe I'll look for some plain exercise DVDS...",1360713600,,553,4.415841584158416

Although some of the positions are hard for me, the kids enjoy it.  I don't find myself working out vigorously but it is a good way to stretch while bonding with the kids.

I wouldn't recommend this as a video to help parents relax or fit your yoga time in with a toddler around. After we were done my son wanted to play the video again but I was exhausted. I gave it 4 stars because I was expecting more wind down time towards the end and it seemed a little low-budget,1346112000,,472,3.8762886597938144

It arrived quicly and the next morning my husband popped the DVD in and couldn't believe that it captivated my kids and they did the entire yoga alphabet. My macho husband thought it was a bit corny but admitted it was great to see how much our kids loved it. It could be that the teacher at camp who introduced it is very enthusiastic and sold them on yoga at first, but in the end, they still love it.

1989881,4,B0001DCXTM,"My kids are 19 months and 3 1/2 and they both love this.

For the first few times, the pace of this DVD really is too fast (and somewhat annoying if you are expecting something more ""zen"").  That said, when you are with a bunch of kids there is a lot of energy and other things going on at the same time--- so the fast pace and excess commentary all works out. I'm only giving it 4 stars because of that mild annoyance factor -- it probably deserves all 5 stars. My kids really like this program.

There is enough repetition and each pose is just long enough to get a little involvement.

The key is to get into a pattern of watching it a lot because otherwise the dvd moves too fast for them to mimic everything if they are not already a little bit familiar with what's coming up.

Even before it was over he ran over excitedly to me and declared that we should do this yoga everyday.  I have NEVER seen my son so excited about yoga before!!  I've been doing yoga off and on for about 15 years, but only seriously for the last three.  There are some poses on this I'll definitely need to work on!  Very well done.  I'll be shopping for Vol 3 for sure!",1340755200,,462,4.193181818181818
1989883,3,B0001DCXTM,"My son is 2.5 and we only got through about two to three poses the first watch (not overly surprising or disappointing for the first time at his age). It was kinda fun, but it just wasn't what I was looking for in a yoga dvd. I wanted real poses/names, and a little more attention to detail. Even though he is young, he would eventually pick up on correct postures. Fun is good, but I definitely wanted a little more serious too. I would have liked something said/to do with breathing up front too, because this is an important part of more yoga and even an emotional component, even if it's just to say ""think of your favorite food or animal or something funny"" in kids perception.. something to set the mood, yoga is more than just physical and games, it's wholistic. And for me, that's just the principal I was going for with teaching my child yoga. Let me know if anyone knows of a good one for us! Thanks

The good: Lots of smiling happy kids doing various poses in various ways, makes it fun and not too boring to watch. Clever idea with the ABC's, just not what I thought it meant.... for example, I would have expected D- downward Dog, they did do E for Eagle pose which was nice, that's as far as we've gotten so far.",1338940800,,1226,4.2844827586206895

1989885,3,B0001DCXTM,"I watch this dvd with my two year old twin boys.
Pros
-Some of the poses are fun to do: Hot Air Balloon, Namaste Song, Cat/Cow
-The kids who do the poses with her are interesting to watch and show mistakes that could be made
-Attempt to teach letters of the alphabet

Cons
-Except for a couple, the poses are not real yoga poses. There are SO many other poses she could have chosen to go with each letter that make more sense.
-Marsha's voice is a bit annoying, especially when she sings
-The poses are not in any fluid order. We are constantly lying on our bellies, then getting up to do a standing pose. By the time my boys stand up, the pose is over.
-Having to stick to the alphabet makes the whole thing a bit contrived for a good yoga lesson.

The DVD moves too quickly through the poses for her to really be able to get it, but that could be due to her age. The songs are fun and sometimes when I spend the day with her I'll let the DVD play for the nice background and she'll do a little Yoga here and there.

However, that's not my biggest complaint.  It's stupid. Boring.  And doesn't come close to resembling anything similar to yoga.  There's far too much ""junk"" in between segments, and I understand you have to keep segments short to keep kids interested, but the segments in between poses either get the child totally distracted or totally bored, and she then doesn't want to do the next pose.

I don't think she will be too old for this next year, and some of the poses are difficult for a small child (and an out-of-shape adult with low flexibility!) to do.  I decided to get this one in the series because it has one pose for each letter of the alphabet, and my daughter likes that.  I didn't find the imagery between the poses to be too long or distracting as some found, but maybe that's because my daughter's on the older end of the suggested age range.",1268524800,,614,4.091666666666667
1989904,2,B0001DCXTM,"My 2.5 yr old daughter loves this DVD, but it makes me crazy.  The thing that bothers me is the way the woman in it (Marsha Wenig) talks.  She doesn't enunciate her words very well and in many cases she simply mispronounces them altogether.  I would tolerate this if it weren't a DVD for children, but I'm worried that my daughter will end up mispronouncing the words, too.

Some examples of her ridiculous pronunciation: ""aligatuh"" (aligator), ""haws"" (horse), ""buttahfly"" (butterfly), ""uh-guana"" (iguana).  She also uses uncommon (though correct) alternate pronunciations like ""quog-mire"" (quagmire) and ""lenth"" (length).  Now you may be thinking that maybe Marsha has some sort of a regional accent, but if she does it's not evident most of the time and it's not one I've ever heard.  It's not an accent, it's just a weird and lazy way of speaking.

Marsha also goes to great lengths to use alliteration to squeeze in as many words as possible that begin with each letter (i.e., ""awesome, amazing alligator"").  While I understand why that makes sense in a DVD where they are teaching the alphabet, she really tries a little too hard and forces words in where they don't even make sense.  Hence, we get a ""loquacious locomotive"" and a ""quadruple quagmire of quails.""

If my daughter didn't enjoy it so much, I'd pitch this right in the trash.  Hopefully I won't have to spend too much time correcting any bad speech habits she picks up from it.",1266710400,16,1445,4.805668016194332

I was worried it would be too old for her.  She certainly can't do all the poses but there are enough easy ones that she is moving a lot during the video.  She also really just likes to watch the other kids doing it...and she loves the outdoor scenes (in the grass & on the beach).  Several of the poses also have songs that go along with them--our favorite is the Namaste Song.

The exercises are also easy enough for me to join along, when I am not folding laundry!

One plus is that it goes through the alphabet as well--each letter is a new pose (i.e. E=Eagle Pose).  So it is a nice little lesson in the alphabet too!

It runs about 30 minutes, and there are about six children and an instructor featured in the video.  It goes through the alphabet and demonstrates poses (i.e. ""A"" is for alligator and you lie on your stomach and wiggle like an alligator while stretching your arms in front of you and clapping your hands together like an alligator opening and closing its mouth).  My son is a little young to follow the poses, but he enjoys watching the kids and hearing the music/songs they sing.  He also laughs at me while I do the poses and encourage him to do the same.  The poses are pretty basic, but they feel good, and there are some helpful explanations for the poses.  For instance, the instructor suggests trying the ""V"" for volcano pose to deal with anger/frustration.

The video is quite good.  Kids seem to respond and like the animal videos and animation shown between each yoga pose.  The 4 and 5 year olds do well with it while the 3 year old seem to lack the focus required to do this for the entire video.  Id recommend it for anywhere between 5 and 7 years old ideally.  Adults should always be present as well to make sure that the kids stretch safely as some of poses can be dangerous without supervision.

Ms. Wenig is a nice presenter with a calm manner and appropriate voice tones.

I even heard her chanting ""Ohm"" while sitting in her high chair, waiting for her lunch! I wish someone had introduced yoga practice to me, when I was a youngster.

The workout on this DVD is a fantastic way for all of us to release pent-up energy on a bad-weather day. To my surprise, one of my grandson's favorite parts is the ""zig-zag"" breathing, during Final Relaxation. This is a kid who lives in perpetual motion!

1989948,2,B0001DCXTM,"For each of the 26 letters of the alphabet, the video features an animal that starts with the same letter (e.g., caterpillar for C), and an exercise to imitate the animal (e.g., crawl on your belly like a caterpillar, walk in a crouched position like a duck).  I only recognized two yoga poses (cat-cow and eagle pose) among the 26 exercises; the rest appeared to be silly creations of the video's producers.  The exercises alternate between standing, lying face-down, lying face-up, on all-fours, etc. with no flow between them, so you are constantly standing up and lying down throughout the video.  Several belly-on-the-floor exercises were the same exercise with very slight variations.  We could expect that a fair number of pregnant women might be exercising alongside her children while watching, but they wouldn't be able to do perhaps 1/3 of the exercises.  I wonder how many other exercises have potential to cause injury.  Little instruction is given for how to correctly enter and exit each pose.  In my view, this video is mistitled and mismarketed.  I'm giving Wei Lana's Little Yogis video a try.",1161820800,10,1111,5.0
1989949,5,B0001DCXTM,I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this dvd!  I am a family child care provider of children ages 2 to 6 and they all really loved it.  The first time they watched it everyone wanted to do it again right away.  Even the younger ones joined in but the older children really got into it.  Well worth the money as an alternative to TV.,1155859200,3,340,4.029850746268656
1989950,4,B0001DCXTM,"I bought this and another Yoga for Kids video because I am doing home daycare in Arizona and I need indoor physical activities. I tried it out on my 2 yr old son and my 3 yr old neice. My neice stayed with it, did the moves and enjoyed it while my son played with his cars on the floor. However, my son LOVES to dance and move, and I think when I am doing it along with the daycare kids, he will join in as well. I think these are good videos for young kids especially if they do them with mom and/or dad.",1155340800,,505,3.8190476190476192
1989951,5,B0001DCXTM,"My 2 year old enjoys this one so much I got another copy for her preschool.

The alphabet format makes it easy for adults new to yoga know how much is left and it helps teach kids their letters. The first time out she made it to the letter ""T"" so it really holds her attention well.

You see an illustration of a letter and then the animal. For instance ""A"" with a little alligator. Then you might see a short clip of the actual animal and then how to do the corresponding yoga pose.

The film quality on this one is much better than the DVD for vol 1.

None of the poses are super hard expect for the backbend. My daughter can do it but I cannot!

Of the three, I think this is the best one.",1149206400,17,692,3.949640287769784
1989952,5,B0001DCXTM,My 5 year old got this as a gift a few years ago and she is still playing with it so that says a lot.  She likes to watch it when she has friends over and I like it because it is an exercise video instead of just a movie.  My daughter breaks it out when she says she needs to stretch and that her muscles ache - guess kids do hear everything their parents say!,1145577600,4,360,3.723684210526316
1989953,4,B0001DCXTM,"Our daughter has weak muscles and I was looking for a workout video that our family could do together to supplement her physical therapy.  I saw the good reviews and although I have never tried Yoga before, I decided to purchase the video.  I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  My daughters don't make it all the way through yet because they get bored.  They are only 3 right now so I think as time goes on this will become a favorite for us all.",1145577600,4,440,4.265060240963855
1989964,5,B0001DCXTM,"My almost 2-year old loves this video.  She asks for this video by bowing her head and saying namaste (every day).  She tries every pose in her own little way.  She really enjoys when we do the video together. Some poses she can do better than me. She can do any pose by its name, iguana, quail, volcano.  Her favorites are peddle laughing and hot air balloon - and laughs histerically when she deflates her balloon.  I think this video has taken her vocabulary and physical abilities well beyond what I would have ever expected.  I was so stunned by her interest in this video and doing the poses I checked out every yoga video designed for kids from our library to see if we could get another (for a change of pace).  This, Yoga Kids Vol 2, is by far the best, and as a result the only one we own.

The production is very good.  The instructor and kids are outdoors in a very peaceful and beautiful setting.  The kids are of all ages, ethnicity and abilities.  There are many poses (26 for each letter in the alphabet) shown so there are sure to be several poses each kid would enjoy.  The namaste song is wonderful and it was a great introduction to idea of yoga.  This video is something I am happy she enjoys so much.",1144195200,10,1222,4.283842794759825
1989965,5,B0001DCXTM,"But I am hoping that they warm to it!  We have all the yoga kids DVDs, and find them challenging to do.  My 4 1/2 year old and my 2 1/2 year old still like ""Animal Yoga:Level I"" better.  This one, when I can get them to do it, helps them learn their alphabet.  If you are homeschooling, which I currently am, this is very helpful.",1142899200,9,330,3.9545454545454546
1989966,3,B0001DCXTM,"We have this (my 2 1/5 year old does it with me), and we like it, but I would prefer one with more actual yoga poses.  This is filled with some poses and some things she just seems to have made up.  There are lots of poses where you do difficult movements while on your belly, and many of them seem like it'd be easy to injure your back or neck because your moving around so fast (acting like a catapillar, for example.)  I couldn't do many of these poses with him while I was pregnant.  I will use this DVD, but I am shopping for another one.",1139184000,4,543,4.0
1989967,5,B0001DCXTM,"I love these tapes... so much that I've started my journey to become a YogaKids teacher! The tapes are fun, encouraging and colorful. Kids love the movement... without all the competition usually found in their daily activities! Thanks Marsha!",1139097600,6,243,5.256410256410256
1989968,4,B0001DCXTM,"My 3 year old daughter loves this DVD! When we get stuck in due to weather/household chores I know that I can still give her something active to do that she enjoys. I've also been able to take some of the poses/techniques that are included and use them to help her with other things - ""Butterfly breaths"" work great when she needs to calm down a little, and ""Namaste"" (sp?)is nice before bed.",1138579200,4,392,4.383561643835616
1989969,5,B0001DCXTM,"I am a yoga enthusiast myself, so I was looking for a dvd I could use with my five and two year old children.  Our ten year old is already using the adult yoga dvds, having outgrown children's yoga videos.  This is a wonderful dvd to add to your collection and the instructor is really good.  I agree with the other reviewer who said she doesn't talk down to the children...this is important.  I once had to get rid of a kids exercise video because our daughter felt insulted by the instructor!

Also, I feel it is important to note that WE also are a Christian family, and find no offense with the use of OM and NAMASTE at all.  This video certainly isn't out to convert anyone to Hinduism!  There is nothing at all wrong with having children learn the value of quiet relaxation, no matter what your religious convictions.  Some of the content found in today's supposedly Christian dvds and stories is far more offensive.  Give this one a try.  You will be glad you did.",1136246400,64,971,4.404494382022472
1989970,4,B0001DCXTM,"My daughter loves this DVD, requests it constantly, and prefers it to other TV / video watching. It's a fun activity for the whole family to do toghether, and while some of the poses can be challenging for little kids (or adults!), you can try  your best and still have fun.  I find my daughter is both happier and relaxed after this exercise!",1131235200,6,343,4.428571428571429
1989971,5,B0001DCXTM,"This program is fun, easy for the kids to do, educational and really beneficial for stretching and muscle tone.  My 4 year old really tries to do the exercises as best as he can and my 2 year old enjoys watching the animals and she tries to do them a little to.  It is so nice to buy an exercise video that doesn't disappoint!",1126656000,8,326,4.078125
1989972,5,B0001DCXTM,"My kids (3 and 5) absolutely love this one!  They ask to watch it at least once a day and love to go through the poses, occasionally asking to do the whole video twice in a row.  They even have their own yoga mats now and this video is one of the few times where they can spend an hour only a couple of feet apart and not start fighting.  They'll even help each other with the poses that they have trouble with.

I highly recommend this video.  It's a wonderful pace, anything slower would bore most kids, anything faster would be too difficult.  I do a regular yoga workout myself but still find it fun to run through the poses with my kids and it's a decent little workout for me as well.",1124236800,10,690,4.111940298507463
1989973,5,B0001DCXTM,"In addition to learning about yoga poses, my kids are also learning their alphabet.  This is the best use for TV... getting my kids some exercise on a rainy day.
