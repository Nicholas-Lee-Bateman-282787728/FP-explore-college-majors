1805044,5,B00007AJGF,"LOVED this film! A family film, even with Tim Curry playing a lead character! He usually only has small vilinous parts. He is one of my favorite actors and I loved seeing him throughout an entire movie! He has a GREAT laugh and a playfulness about him.
""Bobby"" is precious, and has a fantastic time with his fantasy friends. But Jack proves to be more than he bargained for!
Dee Wallace is sterling in anything she is in.
My only complaint was that the film seemed too short!",1101686400,6,475,4.409090909090909

1805074,5,B00007AJGF,"I ran across this film while searchig on amazon for some new dvds. Tim Curry absolutly owns this film as Capt. Jezebel Jack grand adventurer and rogue. It is yet another outstanding movie that didn't get much publicity. Granted the plot of a pirate... sorry i mean adventurer being tossed through time from the caribbean seas into rural modern day well 90's modern day nebraska doesnt really sound like even a c+ movie, but in my opinion not even A+ is enough.",1293840000,,460,4.621951219512195
