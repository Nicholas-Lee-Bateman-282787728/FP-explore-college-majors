7863503,4,6304168381,"My daughter started watching Allegra on Nick Jr.  When we were no longer able to see Allegra's Window there, I bought this tape for her.  She loves the tape so much she jumps up and down while the songs are playing and  yells out to the characters in the tape.  It was especially fun to watch  the tape and my daughter.  It hit on topics like food dislikes, topsy-turvy  day, drawing pictures and why we follow rules.",963532800,4,417,4.337662337662338
