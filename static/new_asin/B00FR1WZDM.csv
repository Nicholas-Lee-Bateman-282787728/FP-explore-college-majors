6022002,5,B00FR1WZDM,Well done; historic culture presented; good pace and story line.  Would like follow up story on Octavian/Augustus.  Would recommend to others.  Well done,1409616000,,153,5.565217391304348
6022003,4,B00FR1WZDM,"The newer release (2013) of this box set does not contain the added booklet or layout that the previous version did (2009) which is probably part of the reason it's cheaper. Running time for the discs is still the same with five blu-rays in each case. There are two cases, one for each season, inside the Rome box which is nothing more than that. The synopsis and information is just an insert attached to the back of the box with that blue triangle part folded over the front.
Loved the series itself and just wish it had more seasons.",1407888000,74,536,4.424242424242424
6022004,5,B00FR1WZDM,"This series is epic in it's undertaking.  The sets are awesome, the costumes superb and the acting is excellent.  The plot line is very intriguing and I could not stop watching it. I've spent many sleepless or little sleep nights watching multiple episodes.  I'm sure there are some historical in-accuracies; there are in any historical film, but none that I noticed.  Yes, there is some explicit language and some complete frontal nudity, and bloody violence, but it really doesn't detract from the story line.  I wouldn't recommend you let children watch it.  Overall, for the sweeping breadth of this series, it is not to be missed.  It gives insight to what life must have been like for everyday Romans verses the upper class of Rome.  All I can say is Epic, it is very Epic.",1396656000,25,779,4.718518518518518
6022005,4,B00FR1WZDM,"Great action movie.  I have already finished Part I.  I can't watch just one episode at a time.  It is violent, second only to ""Spartacus"", the language is raw, and the nudity is restrained, brief, and slightly out of focus even in BluRay/  Nudity is not blurred out.  Not for children or the squeamish.  I can't comment on its historical accuracy, because I am not a scholar of ancient Rome.  I will only say it is plausible and consistent with the general information I have.  I gave me a better understanding of circumstances surrouunding Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.  Worth every penny.",1395792000,6,590,4.82

6022023,2,B00FR1WZDM,"I usually read the rating on DVDs before I purchase them but missed the boat on this one - and I REALLY should have. At least now I know what an Unrated movie actually looks like.. in a word, smut.

Which is disappointing because this movie would have had a lot to offer if it didn't have either a breast, penis, sex scene, or rude joke every 33 seconds. In fact my husband and I had an ongoing game as to which would come up first in each episode.

I was ploughing my way through the trash because I love Ciarin Hinds and Lindsay Duncan. And, to be honest, they didn't mangle up Roman history too much.

But then we got to Cleopatra.

Oh, Cleopatra, what a smutty piece of trash they portrayed you as. And that's when I'd had enough.

And it's a shame; it's a shame that Hollywood thinks that in order to make an interesting  and watchable movie about Rome, they have to make it soft-core porn.",1517184000,,895,4.235294117647059

6022100,4,B00FR1WZDM,"This series by HBO is one of the better looks at what life might have been like in Ancient Rome. Most TV and movie productions show Rome as white marble and people in white togas. This series gives us a glimpse of people with dirt under their fingernails, living in dirty, smelly, crowded neighborhoods, just like any city. That's not to say there isn't lots of action, great sets and exotic locales. From the minute you put in a disc, you hear music that isn't like any other production about Rome, but probably what it might have sounded like, more middle-eastern than movie score. Though pagan, this series shows the religious side of Rome's citizens, not merely orgies and gladiators in the arena. Ot can be a bit ""down and dirty"" and overtly sexual at times, but consistent with real life and HBO production values. Not for the kiddies, but solid, adult viewing with surprisingly high historical authenticity.",1466985600,9,914,4.791139240506329

I cannot wait to get it in the mail. The entire series is very well done with an ironic twist at the end. They spared no expense in costume, design and sets in this lavish spectacle of what Roman life must have been like at the height of the empire. The acting is superb. The producers of the film managed to capture the entire strata of Roman society in one series; and the story line is woven around true historical events.

It is a graphic and true to life portrayal of the people who did not treat each other any better than the people they conquered.  It is obvious from the film that the mafia began long before the 19th or 20th century.  Whether it
existed before Rome was a world power is not certain, but likely given the nature of the times and the inhabitants of Italy.  The struggle for power and money involved all classes of people.  Life in Rome was definitely a matter of survival of the fittest.
The acting in this series is top notch with Mark Antony being the least conventional of all the main characters.
I bought the series because I missed the showing on TV.  I doubt I would have done so if I had seen it as a TV series because it is not easy to watch, however, for those of us who are history buffs, it is interesting to be able to see the people and events we have read about and depicted in such a realistic way.",1430611200,9,990,4.211640211640212

6022212,5,B00FR1WZDM,"I watched this series on HBO when it first came out several years ago. This is a GREAT historical series.  Wonderfully acted , the scenery and depictions are so vivid. Makes you feel like you are in Rome.  I couldn't stop watching it once i started..then and now.  It is addicting. Don't want to give away anything. If you like action, intrigue, love, deception and twists, you will LOVE this series.",1420761600,18,400,4.605633802816901
6022213,5,B00FR1WZDM,"Gritty, detailed look at Roman civilization that goes far beyond what I learned in school.  Maybe a little license was taken with historical facts, but it makes for a great story; sort of an ancient, X-rated ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", with plenty of blood being spilt, too.",1420156800,8,270,5.0

6022221,5,B00FR1WZDM,Received this as a Christmas gift a couple years ago and just getting around to reviewing.  It's unfortunate about the nudity scenes.  My wife and I like the educational aspect of the blu-rays disc and we watch every episode with the extra information put on the screen.  Sometimes it's information overload and we have to pause it often.,1414713600,,338,4.793103448275862

6022224,5,B00FR1WZDM,Great series! Historically accurate but script done in a way that is still interesting and fun.  You get attached to the 2 main characters.  I found myself rooting for them no matter how dismal their predicament was.  The features on this BluRay is great.  Lot's of information.  Commentary from the different cast and directors gave more insight to the series.  Lot's of info!  You won't be dissappointed!,1412726400,,406,4.970149253731344

8618088,5,B00FR1WZDM,"One of the best period dramas I have seen, and perhaps the best depiction of Rome I could imagine. The characters, conflicts, daily life of Roman citizens are all truly inspired. The series is an historical re-imagining of what life was like during the Roman era right down the the smallest details of set design. Bravo!",1523923200,,320,4.732142857142857
8618089,5,B00FR1WZDM,One of the best series I have watched.  If you like Roman you will enjoy this. The only thing that would make this better if it were done in Latin.,1522886400,,147,3.9
