8167900,2,6305604797,"the black mask is certainly less westernised than Jet Li's recent films, and has a very comic book style story and fight choreographing. It is about an elite group of assasins who 'feel no pain' due to genetic experiments, and plan to inflict evil upon asia, cue Jet li, the only 1 who can stop them. The good martial arts don't come until the last few scenes, and are often too fast to appreciate.
All in all, a cheesy film with a cheesy storyline, with just about acceptable martial arts. For better martial arts try the 'Once upon a time in China' series, or 'romeo must die'. For better storyline, try ANYTHING else.",1003968000,,620,4.495575221238938
8167901,4,6305604797,"I liked it. The plot was interesting. It has some of the classic Chinese wire stuff. Some good fight scenes. Dialogue is good. Too much of the ""f"" word for me, even though it does add to the characters. The  action was intense with a lot of quick shot changes. At first it is  annoying, but it somehow makes the movie ""work"". I think you will  enjoy it. This is clearly worth adding to the collection.",956966400,,401,4.25
8167902,3,6305604797,"Although thousands have flocked to their local video store to catch some more of Jet Li's fantastic moves after his appearance in Lethal Weapon 4, this movie is not one of his better efforts.  There is little doubt that Li  is the nastier, less PC version of J. Chan,  however the Black Mask is not  the best showcase for his talents.  This is still a solid chop-sockey flick  that entertains, though; there just happens to be much better out there.",946857600,,449,4.55
