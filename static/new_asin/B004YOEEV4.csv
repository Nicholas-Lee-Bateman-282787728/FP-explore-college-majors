Two cowboys arrive at the Bar-X ranch. The water trough is dry! A hat serves water to the horses. Two armed men stop them but a overpowered and safely neutralized. A white horse lead a herd of horses away to a fenced area. Two men are behind this rustling scheme, a rancher and a foreman. The horses enter a cave which is a tunnel to the other side of a mountain. The ranch owner whose herd was taken offers a $1,000 reward to anyone who kills that white horse. Tom and Windy find that white horse caught in a trap; they release him. Two men try to shoot that white horse but are stopped by Tom and Windy. A woman chases that white horse, Tom rescues her, Windy catches her horse.

Miss Bakers father owns the Bar-X, she explains the situation. Tom promises to deliver the Phantom white stallion broke to the saddle. He is given 48 hours. Windy shovels it in, he loves her cooking. Love at first bite. Tom and Windy find the fences cut by pliers. Tom lassos the Phantom but his pulled off his saddle. Somebody shoots and cuts the rope! Mr. Baker says it wasn't the Phantom since the mares disappeared. Windy overhears the two rustlers plotting. Tom questions Miss Baker then asks to use her mare to trap the Phantom. Windy tells Tom, they ride into town. The sign in the bar says No Credit.

A fight breaks out in the bar, Tom and Windy escape. The next day they trap the Phantom, and Tom rides him. They enter that cave. Tom finds that cabin and fights with the occupant. Tome is captured and tied up. He cuts the rope, writes a note, and send it home by his horse. There is a disagreement among the rustlers over sharing the money, and a fight. Toms horse returned the note. Tom rides the Phantom to escape. Windy warns Mr. Baker and his hands, they go to help Tom. There is a chase, Tom catches Mac. [Does the fight look staged?] Help arrives, they go after the rustlers. Burt confesses and blames Mac. The rustlers are caught. Tom and Miss Baker return on one horse.

This movie has an interesting plot. Could it work in the real world? Probably not. This movie seems to have been edited to fit into an hours running time. I wonder what scenes were omitted?",1506211200,,2187,4.352941176470588

8448721,4,B004YOEEV4,"Amazon has no listing for this DVD-R release from VCI, so I have put it here.  ""Coyote Trails"" from Reliable Pictures looks good, but it appears cut.  Running time sources differ, but indicate it could be cut as much as 10 minutes.  There are 2 minor dialogue splices, and there looks to be some missing footage at the start of one scene.  This is a Tom Tyler Double Feature disc with the second feature being ""Feud of the Trail"" from Victory Pictures.  If not for one unfortunate dialogue splice at the beginning of the picture, this film is complete and would be near-perfect.  It's not easy finding one of these VCI DVD-R prints that have no issues.",1356307200,,652,4.52991452991453
8448722,5,B004YOEEV4,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""COYOTE TRAILS"" (1 February 1935) (54 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Tom Tyler was an American actor in silent and sound motion pictures --- He was born Vincent Markowski, into a Polish-American family --- Tyler had a long career in film, stretching from the 1920s to the 1950s, and appeared in many films, most of them westerns such as John Ford's ""Stagecoach"" and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" --- He occasionally took ""civilian"" roles in feature films (he's the boxing referee in Abbott and Costello's ""Buck Privates""), but the biggest part of Tyler's screen career was spent making low-budget B-movie westerns for modest salaries --- Most of his budget westerns were made by Reliable Pictures for producers Bernard B. Ray and Harry S. Webb.

Larger studios cast the athletic Tyler in rugged roles --- In 1940, he was the Mummy ""Kharis"" in ""The Mummy's Hand"" --- In the first film adaptation of a comic-strip superhero, Tyler had the title role in the 1941 film serial ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"", and starred as one of The Three Mesquiteers in Republic's series of western features.

In 1943, he starred in ""The Phantom"", based on Lee Falk's famous comic strip --- Tyler personified the role, looking especially striking in the character's familiar costume, and much of the serial's great success was due to Tyler himself. It was Tom Tyler's last major screen role --- One of my favorite serials is ""The Phantom of the West"" (1930), was billed as the ""all talking serial"" which is still available through Amazon or VCI Entertainment, great action plus harding riding and fighting scenes with Tom Tyler in the middle and riding in and out of danger.

There is little doubt that Tyler was a shy man most of his life, but he was also a man of inner confidence, willing to take on huge risks within his own abilities over and over again --- Tyler had a tremendous work ethic and enjoyed working hard for what he believed in --- from the weight room to learning his craft in acting --- Tom was a major ""B-Western"" cowboy star and while simultaneously working as a western hero, he was also a weight-lifting champion --- Tyler was once considered the strongest man in America, he won the national AAU weight-lifting championship in 1928 (he lifted 760 lbs.) and made the 1928 U.S. Olympic team.

Tyler was beset by rheumatoid arthritis in the later part of his career, and was limited to occasional supporting roles. Nearly destitute, he returned to live with his sister in the Detroit area, dying there of heart failure at the age of 50 in 1954 -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
