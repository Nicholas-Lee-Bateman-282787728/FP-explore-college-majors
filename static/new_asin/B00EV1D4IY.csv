5945035,5,B00EV1D4IY,I was very pleased to see that they were releasing this PBS concert on DVD.  I had never heard of the Piano Guys until I happened to watch their concert on PBS -- because of this concert I am now an avid fan.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan.,1383264000,,260,3.7962962962962963
5945036,4,B00EV1D4IY,"These guys demonstrate the joy of making music together and with their audience and especially the kids. And we get to join them in the fun on the beach, a flat railroad car or on stage!",1383264000,,186,4.194444444444445
5945037,5,B00EV1D4IY,They did an excellent job on this.  The sound detail you can hear makes it worth having this.  I hope they release the DVDs version of Beethoven's 5 Secrets on mp3.,1382400000,7,164,4.258064516129032
5945038,5,B00EV1D4IY,"I finally get an opportunity to review a Piano Guys concert! There are, obviously, some differences between a music video/mp3 versus a live performance. One of the things I love about a live Piano Guys show is the banter between Jon and Steven. Now, this DVD doesnt have a great deal of this banter, but there's enough there to get a good feel for what it's like to see them live.
One thing that may confuse people who follow TPG, is the fifth performer in the song What Makes You Beautiful. Tel Stewart was a member of The Piano Guys and still helps make their music videos, but he is no longer ""officially"" one of The Piano Guys.
This concert lasted about 3.5 hours from start to finish, but that's mostly because some songs had to be done several times to get the sound and video just right. The DVD runs about an hour and fifteen minutes if you include the three bonus songs. The Piano Guys like to loop audio tracks, so a song with only one cellist has 8 cellos all playing simultaneously. The way they do this live is by seamlessly switching from one audio track to the next, usually playing which ever cello track is in the foreground at the moment. Another nice aspect to their concerts is the video screen, which often shows the music video while they are playing the song.
The song list from this concert is a perfect mix of a few classics, and most of their new stuff at the time. The performance of Beethoven's 5 Secrets was accompanied by the Lyceum Orchestra, playing ""flash mob"" style, amongst the crowd. (The percussion section was right behind us). The emotions are not hard to hear, and they're even harder to miss when you watch Steven crying tears of joy by the end of the piece.
The song that is a must see, though, is Simple Gifts/Over the Rainbow which is performed with the help of the One Voice Childrens Choir and sounds absolutely amazing.
Alex Boye is another guest and lends his incredible vocals to Peponi (Paradise).
And lastly, don't forget to catch Can't Help Falling in Love in the bonus section. Steven adds a cello accompaniment which always leaves a smile on my face.
If you would like to experience a Piano Guys concert, but they aren't
coming to your town any time soon, (or not soon enough...) this is a great example of what a live show is like.
And to all the TPG fans out there, this is a lot cheaper and easier to get a hold of now that PBS isn't the sole distributor. (Its about time too, I gave away my copy as a gift).
I hope, as time goes on, this is not the only DVD that The Piano Guys release. They are always entertaining live and seeing more of the in-between stuff (like Steven's banana gag for Pachelbel's Canon) would be a welcome addition to a live DVD.
P.S.... A blu-ray would be really awesome, too. ;-)",1382313600,58,2762,4.396484375

5945051,4,B00EV1D4IY,"I love The Piano Guys and this is a great video I would give this 5 stars. I give it 4 stars for a few reasons. Its not available in bluray, the sound coukd have been mixed better you have to turn the volume up on songs and down on screaming on applause, they sound a little far away. You but a dvd there should be no advertising on it you paid for it. But this one has mention of key bank sponsoring it at the beginning and end not in the middle it's still weird and I love The Piano Guys though this is a great concert and some of their great songs it's not long enough.",1483142400,3,572,3.8559322033898304

The audience is very much a part of the happiness of The Piano Guys.  I believe that exposing young people to this type of music and entertainment will open them up to the experience of 'fine' music and the joy of musical variety.

The reason that I took off one star is that I hated the editing.  I really don't care about the audience, I want to see the Piano Guys.  Sometimes, the camera would be on a pretty girl for a minute, and I really don't care to see her no matter how pretty she happens to be since I just wanted to see the Piano Guys.  I felt like when the cameras were on the audience, I was missing what was going on the stage.  This was especially true when Cello Wars was playing, and the camera guy lingered on this girl's butt for a whole minute.  I wanted to see Dark Vader or Chewbacca.  I would of preferred to see Dark Vader playing the accordion for that minute.  Less audience, more Piano Guys please!!",1419984000,5,832,4.176100628930818

I'm hopelessly hooked; transcended into eternal musical bliss.  Inspirational...virtuosity capable of altering a persons entire mindscape.  When this aural masterpiece is on, everything else is off.  Never has so much been accomplished with a piano and a cello. (oh, and a hundred or so talented kids, some cameras, and a few ""extra"" guys fooling with the piano)

5945242,5,B00EV1D4IY,"I first heard of / saw The Piano Guys on a PBS fundraising program.  These guys are true musicians.  My 8 year-old and 5 year-old grandsons often request to watch/listen to the DVR of that broadcast; we have been waiting for the DVD availability.  Wait til you see the Cello Wars segment; it is very entertaining.  The only disappointment I have with this DVD is that the song ""Peponi"" (Paradise) with vocalist Alex Boye is not included on the DVD although the PBS broadcast of this concert included that song; Mr. Boye is also listed on the (back) cover of the DVD even though ""Peponi"" is not included.  Probably a licensing issue.",1389225600,3,632,4.607142857142857

5945247,5,B00EV1D4IY,How can you not love the creativity in what Jon Schmidt does with the piano and what Steven Nelson does with his cello in this richly diverse concert?  They play superbly and cross over from classical to pop music in unexpected and comical ways.  The sights and sounds are beautiful and the performances switch from intensely touching to wildly quirky.  I love these guys and their team.,1388620800,8,387,4.746268656716418

5945257,5,B00EV1D4IY,"Absolutely fantastic!  This was a fun one to watch!  Most of the songs included are from their first CD, and it was tastefully put together, they had a wonderful twist with ""over the rainbow/simple gifts""-which is my FAVORITE, where a childrens choir sings in a ""moving musical movement"" for lack of a better term for us non-musical people who don't know the lingo! :)  My children aren't allowed to watch television regularly, but when they do they request The Piano Guys.  My three year old LOVES them and listens to them almost during every waking moment-seriously.  He ONLY chooses this DVD or the DVD from the deluxe edition sets of their second CD and Christmas CD.  It used to be Bob the Builder, now it's The Piano Guys-and you'll find me watching it with him!  Just to mention, this DVD is mostly songs, not as much ""banter"" as I would have liked-guess I'll have to go to a real concert for that!",1385337600,14,905,4.549382716049383
