604410,5,6303236685,"This movie will take your breath away. It is a wonderful recreation of the real thing. It may be a sad movie, but it tells the lives of those who survived this terrible camp and anyone who watches it will definelty learn  something about how precious life is.",914976000,,259,4.395833333333333
604411,4,6303236685,"Based on Richard Rashke's account of the only successful organised Jewish uprising against Nazis from within death-camp barbed wire, ""Escape from Sobibor"" is an admirable effort adapted for film. Despite its often melodramatic made-for-TV overtones (something cliche'd and rather inappropriate for such a weighty and sombering event in human history), the film captures the painful struggles, defiance against the ugliest of tyranny, and ultimate triumph of the Jewish prisoners over their oppressors. Unlike ""Schindler's List,"" which unfortunately represented its Jewish characters in a one-dimensional and consistently passive light, this film presents us with strong, well-developed characters, from numerous backgrounds and levels of experience, who are justifiably angry and rebellious against the Nazis. The characters are well-acted, with all the passion, heart, spirit, and SOUL it undoubtedly must take to play such demanding and emotionally draining role! s. I recommend this movie fully; it will touch viewers with the spirit of sorrow amid triumph, and vice versa.  END",902188800,4,1081,5.885350318471337

604487,5,6303236685,"I was born in 1955, and I was NOT taught about the Holocaust in school. I remember someone telling me about this when I was 21. It was just too shocking for me to believe! After I found out...I researched everything I could, and am still doing it to this day, I find it so unimaginable, an atrocity such as this could even happen. Where was our USA??? We didn't get involved until the Russians took action. I often think about why our country, and our citizens could be so apathetic. This is the most horrific...I don't believe there are even words that can describe this. All humanity was void. This has deeply affected me, how so MANY people could possibly believe this was acceptable and even participated in such horror. This was the world's hell on earth, with the most evil humans.

I've willingly and from curiosity and from a desire to be angry for the oppressed and to gather yet more of the same reminders of what occurred.

Both men and women will like this movie. There is even a little romance. The struggle is between liberty and tyranny. Nazis are the tyrants--but they need FORCE to rule over others. Once the prisoners realize that, they develop a plan. They count how many SS officers rule over them, and then plan to take out each one. They free the entire camp!

604773,5,6303236685,"Saw this back in the day when it first came out.  Watched it again today.  I liked the heroism of it.  The entire camp of enslaved inmates escaping in mass from a well guarded concentration death camp in Nazi Germany was stirring.  Although less than half made it out alive,  that still means nearly 50% beat the odds.  Then they had to keep themselves alive until the end of the war.  Many did not.  But once the war was over, things changed.  Of course, the motto: NEVER AGAIN! (one of the last things said in the movie by the narrator) means only that it never happened again in mass to the Jews.  Once the amalgamate Jewish immigration to Israel began, they became a force to be reckoned with.  But it still happens today, these genocides--only to darker skinned people.  There will always be evil.  I wish more of the WWII camp occupants of that era had been as daring as those who fled Sobibor. .  Although circumstances may never have been present for them to do that.  The Germans learned from this escape. I cannot imagine the horror of any of it.  I appreciated hearing about those who lived after the war and how they went on to testify against those responsible for such atrocities.  Plus, I was touched by the loyalty they had for each other.  I have always enjoyed Rutger Hauer's performances, even when the movies are bad.  This one wasn't, just the times and the circumstances of the story were bad.  Alan Arkin has been a favorite of mine, too, ever since I saw him in the flick, The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming.  He is a good actor.  All-in-all, it is stirring rendition of what happened, the one and only time, there was a mass revolt and escape by the inmates from a German Death Camp.",1467590400,4,1722,4.451923076923077

According to IMDB, this film was originally shot with 35mm, so there is no excuse, other than trying to trick people like myself, for releasing such a poor quality DVD.  It's practically unwatchable.  In fact, if you have an old CRT TV, you might hook up your DVD player to it so it will blur it a bit.

If you can see the film in a format that does it justice, then it's highly recommended.  But for now, I'll have to wait for a better version--and you should to.",1466812800,12,647,4.35

The escape scene at the beginning of the movie is not shown to its conclusion,cut short, you are never informed how the escapees got on because that part was cut out. The camp inmates are paraded  so Wagner can present them with the bodies of the escapees on a handcart, shot down in their desperate attempt and Wagner standing over them murderously gloating,really bad editing. Other scenes edited out are Schlomo in his hut confronted by the two Kommandants being told to make a gold insignia bearing the Kommandant's initials to be fixed on his riding crop. Schlomo tells him ""I could make that for you but I don't have any gold"" whereupon Wagner throws a bag of gold teeth fillings on the table. And there are other scenes left out which in my opinion slights the efforts of  all who took part in the making of this fine film. It could have been a whole lot better had it been left the way it was originally intended, the full story.",1454630400,15,1572,4.486013986013986
604856,5,6303236685,"This is a very inspiring film.  I like films like this because they leave you feeling warm and fuzzy.  It is better to leave people with triumph.  I think there has been enough suffering by the hands of evil, greedy, selfish, jealous and low IQ'd nazi oafs. It's so funny how easily they were sabotaged with all their guns, decor, and planning about how to give the Jews no room to escape or rebel, they were still defeated so easily.  There must have been countless never-to-be-told stories of heroic groups of Jews killing the big dumb oafs with all their oaf weapons anyway.  But I'm sure the embarrassed nazi oafs were sure to murder every Jew in visible radius of those events so that the story could not be retold.  And then they learned over and over again exactly how to avoid all possible pitfalls through hundreds of thousands of mishaps.

605239,5,6303236685,"This is a review for the video version. But whichever version one views one will see a well-crafted motion picture that shows the human triumph over adversity. I was a small child when this originally aired on TV in 1987. But I will never forget how this movie affected me. Indeed, it was my first real visual experience of a Holocaust film.

All of the portrayals were spot on. The casting of the actors, the recreation of the sets and the costumes made it seem as if we were back in 1943. The cruelty that the viewer is shown is tamed for TV but makes one realize how worse it must have been for the poor hapless souls condemned to Hell on Earth. The spirit that the Jewish prisoners possessed was remarkable. I think of another book I read by a Holocaust survivor called: Man's Search For Meaning, by Viktor Frankel; it is that inner strength that the prisoners possessed that allowed them to survive up to the point where they revolted against their oppressors.

I taped this from cable years ago and had not seen it since 1995 but even today this film moves me. I was brought to tears in the beginning of the movie when the families were being separated by the brutal SS. I can't imagine how this must have felt. How evil on such a scale could be perpetrated I'll never understand. Yet it happened and people were massacred.

The cast is fantastic. Rutger Hauer's performance along with Alan Arkin and Joanna Pacula along with a powerful performance by Hartmut Becker as the ruthlessly evil Gustav Becker gave this film a realistic feel and tone. I will never forget it. Buy this on DVD ASAP. I know I will. This is a Five Star film and while the subject matter is ""old"", the topic is unfortunately timeless as we see how man is evil to his fellow man.

How gripping the story might be, you cannot just give five stars for the story alone. The story is not everything. There is a lot in this movie that does not deserve such a positive review everyone is posting.

Apparently Alan Arkin was not big enough a star to headline this movie. Rutger Hauer, who can be seen in only HALF the movie, get's better advertising than Arkin. In 1987 Hauer had only made a few films, Arkin a lot more. So how is this justified? His portrayal of a russian lieutenant is well..... very poor. His mock russian accent and his lack of emotions is certainly not scripted. It's a very stiff performance in comparison to Alan Arkin for instance. He portrays his character Leon briliiantly.

Overall the acting in this movie is somewhat too cautious, too careful to really raise emotions and does not at all reflect the horrors and atrocities that occured in that camp. The scenes where the german soldiers are stabbed and murdered are really, really bad and almost hilarious to watch. Like watching an old 50's movie. This movie is also badly directed. Watch this movie closely and you can see a whole lot of mistakes. You will see breathing corpses, actors and extras constantly looking into the camera and the worst death scenes in the history of filmmaking. For instance when the prisoners are running towards the gate, the soldier guarding the gate gets shot and you can see him falling down and rolling off the road into a ditch so he won't be ""in the way"" when they exit through the gate.",1414022400,,1668,4.650847457627119

605757,5,6303236685,"Sobibor is the only successful concentration camp uprising planned by the prisoners that leads to their freedom.  The camp is located in a secluded place in Poland near to the train tracks. When the prisoners arrive, they are divided into lines and separation.  Some go to the work camp while the others disappear.  A prisoner asks another where his family is, and a prisoner points out the building, where the smoke fills into the sky, that is the crematorium.

The soldiers capture prisoners trying to escape over barbed wire fences.  They line up the camp and tell the escapees to pick someone else to die with them by the firing squad.  When they do not choose others, the guards threaten to kill all of them.  They all choose another person, and the firing squad begins the killing.

A group of Russian prisoners are taken captive and placed in Sobibor.  The prisoners  devise a scheme with the help of a Russian commander.  One day, six hundred prisoners fight for their freedom and run out of camp cutting through barbed wire, and running among mines.  Three hundred prisoners make it to safety.

Sobibor is a well told story.  The suspense builds towards the final escape of Jewish prisoners and others.  The escape is a powerful true victory.  Sobibor is a unique story.  It is about the courageous people who make it happen.  I highly recommend this movie.",1405382400,,1366,4.740425531914894

605855,5,6303236685,"I obtained this movie from my father's wide collection of movies. Sobibor is in eastern Poland. An extermination camp was built there primarily for Jewish people gathered from parts of Europe such as Poland, the Netherlands, Russia, etc. On arrival, those selected for labor are separated from those that were to be immediately killed by gassing or otherwise, men, women and children. Those selected for labor are to be exterminated later on. What was horrifying for me and my friends were the scenes such as the arrival of a train in Sobibor. To deceive the doomed people, the Nazis begin to play that beautiful Strauss Waltz ""Tale from the Vienna Woods"" and to see some of the unsuspecting children swaying their bodies to the rythym of the music was just heartbreaking. The roles played by the American actor (Alan Arkin)  as a leader of the concentration camp inmates and the German actor ( Rutger Hauer) as a Jewish Russian prisoner of war were just extremely commendable. However, everyone including the acting of the German Nazi Officers,their subordinates and their prisoners who played certain roles in the movie, was so impressive that the Director of this movie did an excellent job in our opinion.

If you watch this movie, be prepared to be exposed to the wanton cruelty of the German SS Nazi officers and the callousness of their just as cruel Ukrainian SS Guards. What is very disheartening is the fact that this is a true account : how cruel can a human being be to his fellow human. Therefore, a planned  escape from this Camp of Hell was very desirable. We gave ""Escape from Sobibor""  5 stars because we thought it was worth it.",1392940800,,1646,4.764912280701754

Those are good books and good movies, but one that doesn't get the recognition it deserves is a great movie entitled Escape From Sobibor with Alan Arkin and Rutger Hauer about the only documented escape from a concentration camp in World War 2.  The thing that is most incredible about this powerful movie is that it's true!  Not that Night or Schindler's List are not true stories, but Escape from Sobibor ends on a very powerful and uplifting note in which most to all of the Jews (those who want to at least) who can escape do escape!  Now they don't all survive and some were recaptured (and most likely killed) but many, many Jews survived, and not only that, many of them got to kill their SS Oppressors as well!  How powerful is that!  This was shown on T.V. and I showed it to my six year old son and twelve year old daughter.  The subject matter is definitely PG but I wouldn't rate it higher than that even though the subject matter is so intense with horrifying scenes depicted continuously throughout the movie, but the truth is, these stories need to be told.

Despite the risks, the prisoners feel they should risk it before they are eventually killed by the Nazis.

Although the true horrors of the concentration camps are not explicitly depicted in this movie, the courage of the camp inmates, especially those planning the escape is very vividly portrayed.

606169,5,6303236685,"Escape from Sobibor, 1987 film

In 1942 Himmler built the extermination camps that were sited in eastern Poland: Treblinka, Belzec, and Sobibor (unpopulated areas of pine trees). In October 1943 the prisoners in Sobibor revolted and escaped, the greatest during WW II. Those who had a trade were saved for labor, the others went to the death chambers. The story shows how some who tried to escape (without a plan) were shot. The others are lined up along the railroad tracks to greet new prisoners with smiling faces. They arrive in freight cars. ""Hard work is good for your soul."" [Do those who give this advice follow it?] Those will skills are selected. The new arrivals are separated into two groups: women and children, and men and boys. The rest are taken to the showers, a building set apart from the others. One woman volunteers to care for the rabbits and chickens.

One man plans an escape and looks for allies. The SS men talk about their lives. We see the horrors of people lined up to enter the ""showers"". Survival is the way to revenge. Those who break the rules are punished severely. A load of Dutch prisoners arrive. Some dance for entertainment. During work two prisoners try to escape while fetching water from a stream. Others run off, but they are caught. They will all be killed after choosing another prisoner to die with them! The planned escape must allow all six hundred so no one is left behind for reprisals. Is that possible? New prisoners arrive, they are captured Soviet soldiers to do heavy labor. Their lieutenant talks to them. We see how lunch is served. They discuss the plan but must be careful. Sasha meets Luka. The SS must be killed first to neutralized the armed guards.

This must be done one by one in secret. One man can make many knives. One kapo is brought to a shed and silenced. They plan the details. It will happen after 4pm. ""It begins."" One by one the enemy are killed. Will there be a hitch in the plans? They will make it work. The bugle sounds roll call and people assemble. But an event pushes up the escape. People rush for the gate. Shots are fired, people fall. The barbed wire fence is cut. People flee to the woods, their only hope of escape. Some set off the mines. Some are shot before they reach the woods. But over 300 survived. They tell what happened to these and what they did afterwards. This camp was destroyed and obliterated by the Nazis. There is a postwar monument among the pine trees.

This was filmed on location in Belgrade Yugoslavia. It was based on Thomas Blatt's manuscript ""From the Ashes of Sobibor"" and Stanislaw Szmajzner's ""Inferno Sobibor"". Years ago I read ""A Man Called Intrepid"". The Allies knew about those death camps but didn't popularize this knowledge. It was kept secret until the last days of the war.",1357257600,,2799,4.603206412825651

To learn about the story, please read the Amazon description and other reviews.

Regarding the 143 minute version... (uncut, extended, original)

All of the many DVD varieties sold on Amazon are the 119 minute version.  If you see a listing on Amazon that says 143 minutes, then you should email the merchant to verify the length of the movie BEFORE you purchase it (that's what I did, plus I checked the UPC against other websites).

One review dated September 15, 2012 said they got the Granada (or Grenada) Ventures version, and it was the longer version.  But that company doesn't exist anymore.  And I emailed that reviewer, but didn't hear back from them regarding where they purchased that version (since there is no listing on Amazon).

There are a couple of websites that have the 119 minute version that you can watch online for free.  Apparently, this movie is in the public domain.

I did learn that the 143 minute version is unique to Europe, specifically the United Kingdom.

I was able to purchase the 143 minute version from an eBay merchant named public_domain_movies.  They are based in the UK.  They burned the movie (using NTSC format) onto a DVD and shipped it to me in a paper sleeve.  It cost 7 bucks including shipping; I placed my order Dec 12 and received it Dec 26.  And the movie/DVD transfer was much better than the copy that I rented from Netflix.

Currently, public_domain_movies doesn't have any listings (probably taking time-off for Christmas). However, you could search for that user name on eBay and email them for info (go to eBay, at the bottom click ""site map"", then click ""find a member"").

So, what's the difference between the 119 and 143 minute versions? I watched the 119 minute version originally, but haven't watched the 143 minute version yet. However, check-out the two reviews on Amazon that do list some of the differences: one is dated October 27, 1999 and the other is dated August 23, 2000.

If you want to buy the 119 minute version, then consider buying the DVD published by TGG  (or TGG Direct, or TGG/Diamond):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-from-Sobibor/dp/B0000A0DWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape from Sobibor</a>. One review dated March 30, 2012 stated that the movie transfer for this version was better than most.

606230,5,6303236685,"Based on the true story of an uprising in one of the Polish death camps in which over 300 prisoners escaped during WWII. Leon Feldhendler(played by Alan Arkin), the Jewish leader of the camp, is trying to figure out how to get everybody out of the camp (rather than just a few) when Russian Jewish soldiers are brought to the camp. He makes an alliance with their leader, Alexander Pechersky (played by Rutger Hauer), and what transpires is a gritty means of escape that puts ""The Great Escape"" to shame. Joanna Pacula stars as Luca, the pretty love interest, who might be best known to Americans as the love interest of Doc Holliday in ""Tombstone"".

The tale is gruesome and horrifying (even by 1980s standards) but there's enough determination and hope that you don't get depressed to the point where you want to give up and turn the DVD off. Alan Arkin is close to superb as the Jewish leader who points out the obvious futility in trying just any means of escape and waiting for the opportune moment where just not a few but all of the camp can get out. As to be expected it isn't a cake walk and of course there are surprises but it's well developed and does an admirable job (unlike many other films) of trying to stay true to what really happened at Sobibor.

Life of the characters are revealed at the end. Over 1.25M Jews were killed in this death camp. Close to 300 prisoners escaped. Something that would never happen in another death camp during WWII. Shortly after the escape the camp was pulled down and grown over in the hopes that nobody would remember it.

Based on a novel of a similar title by Richard Rashke. Camp survivor Thomas Blatt served as a technical consultant. Trivia below. After watching this again I need to compare it to the oh so mighty ""Schindler's List"". Some have complained of the DVD quality but I don't feel that should factor into the grade of this fine film. This is graded from a 1980s standard when technology was less sophisticated.

STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; TONE/HOLOCAUST FOCUSES: A minus to A; OVERALL GRADE: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: 2002 (third viewing and review in early July 2012).

TRIVIA/SOME SPOILERS: there were two other uprisings at Auschwitz and Treblinka. In actuality 300 did escape but most of them were recovered. Only a fraction of them evaded their pursuers. Roughly 50. Hauer's character truly did plan the revolt with a few others and was not recaptured historically. German SS were actually assassinated to confuse the rest of the guards. According to one person interviewed on the History channel (who had been at the camp) people truly did run over the corpses of the fallen to avoid setting off mines.

MORE SPOILERS: the desperate run through the minefield as they were being shot at was one of the most memorable moments. Creepy when the SS played classical music to make the new Jewish prisoners feel they were in something other than a death camp. Nice scene where the SS guy trying his boots out spotted the axe and moved away in time. Not all of them could be clueless idiots around people who clearly hated them. Believable assassinations performed by mostly normal people who were not experienced in such matters.",1341792000,,3272,4.711538461538462

This was the impression the students were given by the teachers at that time. I never, ever heard of Sobibor until I was an adult. Alan Arkin is a great actor and one of my favorites, however, I feel that his performance was a little too muted. His character should have been more heated about getting out. This  film  should be showed at schools so that the students will know that people would do anything including dying for freedom.

606318,4,6303236685,"I first watched this film on television when it originally aired in 1987, knowing nothing of the Sobibor camp or the uprising that took place there in October 1943. Having recently read the book by Richard Rashke, I learned detail by detail what these courageous souls endured at the hands of the Nazis and the evil to which they were subjected. Sadly, their suffering did not automatically come to an end after their escape from the camp as many of these individuals faced even more hatred and brutality elsewhere. This is truly a great movie and one that, in my opinion, should be required viewing for anyone wanting to know more about this dark period in history. However, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed with the DVD, as there are scenes from the original that have been edited - scenes that are key to understanding the characters and also their eventual escape from the camp. Overall, though, this remains one of the best - and most fascinating - films ever made in regards to the Nazi death camps and WWII. The performances of Rutger Hauer, Alan Arkin, and many of the other  actors are top-notch and well-deserving of the praise they received from critics. Despite the edits to this movie, I highly recommend it to those who might have missed it when it aired nearly 23 years ago. The ending will literally have you on the edge of your seat and yearning to know more about what happened after the escape at Sobibor.",1266710400,2,1434,4.623529411764705

606320,4,6303236685,"Anyone used to recent films about the Holocaust such as "" Shindler's List"" and "" Life is Beautiful"" may be disappointed with this film. Firstly it does not have the same production values, the "" mise en scene"" that distinguishes great directors from the run of the mill. Nor does it have an ""A"" list cast although both Alan Arkin and Rutger Haur were well known at that time and both give memorable performances. But in some ways this contributes to the power of the film. Based on real events the story centres on the organisers of the mass escape from the Sorbibor Death Camp in Eastern Poland. The film is fast moving and the narrative is one of a conventional action movie. None of the visual horror of a Nazi Death Camp is conveyed. The inmates look relatively well nourished and clean. But then we are reminded that many of these inmates were skilled workers or involved in the "" dirty"" work of sifting through murdered Jews belongings after they were gassed, maintaining the warehouses of clothes, jewellery and extracted teeth and shaven hair for the ""pioneering"" German approach to recycling and "" greeting"" their condemned brethern off the trains by ""helping"" them with their language. An exercise in deceit and perverse irony by the Nazi Kommandant who sought to keep order by creating an initial sense of "" normality"" on the arrival of the Jewish cargo from the trains.

Its general knowledge that these prisoners were eventually murdered as well and they too were aware of this. For example there are scenes of prisoners attempting to escape being killed and a spine chilling scene of soon to be executed prisoners being forced to pick a "" partner"" from the other inmates to die with in collective retribution for their escape attempt.

Before then they would have been kept relativily healthy whilst the were useful. They were allowed to mix freely when not working, and would have had access to tools such as knives and hammers which could easily be made into weopens. This relatively "" priveleged"" position enabled the prisoners to have the means to escape. In all, out of 600 inmates 300 managed to breach the perimater fence of meticulously executing most of the German and Ukrainian gaurds with their improvised weopens. Several were killed in the attempt by the surviving camp gaurds whilst others were either recaptured and murdered or murdered in transit by farmers etc who wanted whatever valuable they had with them. Others just simply disappeared and were never seen again. However this film was put together on the testimony of the several survivors and is a tribute to their bravery, spirit and ingenuity. This is where it differs from a Hollywood interpration. There is no single "" saviour"" such as in ""Shindler's List"". It focuses on certain individuals but the escape is seen as a community working together. Jews as several heros, working for the collective good for all and not as passive victims. It is all the better film for that, and is mirrored in the excellent ensemble acting of the American, British and trans-European cast.",1250899200,,3064,4.845419847328245

606474,5,6303236685,"I never understood the immense praise of ""Schindler's list"". True, the stroy is compelling and important enough, but the way filmmaker Spielberg brings it to the screen, with an avalanche of rather cheap gadges like bombastic music, self-indulgend camerawork, melodramatic subplots and a range of over-acting, make for a film that drowns halfway in form. And this is a sad thing, especially for an important movie like this, which tackles the most horrific events in modern history.
The director and his technical crew should have taken a few steps backward and let the dramatic events speak for themselves, for they are dramatic enough.

Two movies with the Holocaust as background which are to me great examples of how it could and should be done are the made-for-tv ""Escape from Sobibor"" and a tiny, unknown Polish film called ""Korczak"", made by veteran director Andrej Wajda and the even so veteran cameraman Robby M?ller. Both are stand-out artists whose presence in this movie goes almost unnoticed.
The story is what counts here and all technical matters are there just to `observe' the happennings, brought by the script, rather that emphasize it (and hereby over-do it, like in the Spielberg thing). The result is a great tale told in a small and sober way. The effect is enormous.
The same can be said about the just mentionned ""Escape from Sobibor"".

It tells the based-on-facts tale of the big escape from deathcamp Sobibor. Alan Arkin, who is perfectly cast as the face of `any ordinary man' witnesses the cruelty in the camp and slowly comes to realise that escape, how sheer impossible it might seem, is the only chance of survival.
However the movie doesn't concentrate on one leading person, but is more of a mosaic of characters who are forced to do extraordinary things in horrible circumstances.

Functioning as one of the three (sobibor, belzec and treblinka) Operation Rainhard extermination camps during the first half of the war, the camp's main responsability was to eliminate as many ""non-desireble"" people as possible and was one of the first camps that incorporated the infamous gas chambers as a method of systematic dispousal. I won't review the movie because it's a must see for anyone interested in the horrifying event that ended the life of more that eleven million individuals (more than 6 1/2 million jews, 50,000 Romas (gypsies), 1 million mentally ill and over 3 million other non desireble persons and POWs) sadly about this film, is that for someone that's not familiar with the brutal events of the holocaust, won't find this film shocking, even though it's very powerful. There's no inside look on the atrocities that took place at sobibor and the insightful view of the place where more than 250,000 people were muedered; is pretty overlooked...I believe it's probably  the fact that not even the prisioner knew exactly what was going or where was all the people that was send to the showers on the minute they arrived. The story of survival will depress you and the execution escene where the SS Komandant order 13 prisioners that tryed to scape to choose a person each to be executed with then, is simply, on of the heart breaking moments on modern cinema.

They soon realize that if they manage to escape, other prisoners will get killed, so they have to see to that all the prisoners in the entire camp can escape at the same time. The group, led by Leon (Alan Arkin), soon gets help from a Russian (Rutger Hauer).
It's a slow moving film that portrays the life in the concentration camp, the prisoner's way of trying to do the best of their situation, not giving up and keep living to get revenge. It also shows how brutal a man can get when he gets power over others.
It's well written with many great scenes, has excellent acting by all actors, especially by Arikin and Hauer, and is sometimes quite touching. It's a very good movie that makes you think and can lead to interesting discussions. Highly recommended!",1020038400,12,855,4.594771241830065
606536,5,6303236685,"Sobibor was one of the concentration camps that killed Jews during World War II. It was the most secret camp that the nazi party established. ""Esacpe from Sobibor"" is a touching and very, very sad movie of how the Jews that were being held at Sobibor planned an escape. This movie is my favorite holocaust movie; and there are a lot of them.
 ""Escape from Sobibor"" is my favorite Holocaust movie because it is very suspenseful. The Jews make a plan and as the movie develops you gain more of an interest for this movie and what will happen to the Jews. The actors were very good and depicted the Jewish people in Sobibor very well. The concentration camp depicted what it was really like to be at one of the camps during WWII.
 I will continue to watch this movie over the years. i recommend this film to anybody that is interested in the Holocaust and would like a little drama added to the story. This is my favorite Holocaust movie and you'll probably enjoy this movie. This is a film that's not to be missed.

606544,5,6303236685,"Easily the most gruesomely memorable films of arguably the darkest period in contemporary history, this film / mini-series, the latter form which  dominated on tv casting in the USA, conjures up one of the truest, most  poignant images of man's hatred of his fellow man.  Though certainly not as  sophisticated in its production values and chimerical emotiveness as  Speilberg's Schindler's List, the film is messianic, yet shamelessly brutal  in the conceptual truth that it serves to disseminate. Led by a stellar  cast (kudos to the casting director), that included Alan Arkin with his  repressed rage, and almost simplistic visions of freedom, Rutger Hauer, as  the bookkeeper turned Russian POW who epitomises grit and belief, and  Joanna Pacula, who radiates a heretofore unprecedented strength of  character, the film showcases man's determination against what are easily  construed to be fierce odds against survival, much less escape in one of  the most feared Death Camps in the Nazi regime.
Scenes of poignancy such  as the vociferous exchange between Schlomo and Alan Arkin in the barracks  wherein the latter explains the true explanation behind the fire in Camp 3,  Schlomo's brothers' discovery of the mechanical death factories in Camp 3,  and Alan Arkin urging the stoical, almost fatalistic Jews to make good  their escape ina  frantic turn of events stand out among a host of other  images that are vignettes in a drama of epic proportions. Sadly expunged  from the American version (and included in the European version) are  additional scenes of brutality that bear mute testimony to the ruthless  hegemony extended by Ukrainian soldiers, and Jewish kapos toward the  hapless Jewish prisoners.  Scenes wherein a Jewish prisoner is flogged to  death until he can no longer count the lashes in Camp 4 (the hard labour  camp), and the massacre of the 13 would-be escapists from the same camp is  violently stirring to say the least.  In the midst of all this truth, there  lies a sliver of hope in the nurturing of the fact there is hope, when we  are transported to the commemorative statue and plaque erected (on the  outskirs of the camp)in memory of those who died in Sobibor that enunciates  in its syncopacious realism, ""Never again a reality"".",967075200,6,2268,5.076086956521739

606573,5,6303236685,"""Escape from Sobibor"" is a 1987 made-for-television British film about the mass escape (of three-hundred prisoners) from the extermination camp at Sobibor into the forest. Despite the fact that the other three-hundred prisoners remained in the camp, and that out of the three-hundred who escaped, all but roughly 50 - 70 of them were later re-captured and killed, the escape (or uprising) was the most successful among the other German extermination camps (Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka).

The film, based on Richard Rashkes book Escape from Sobibor, is directed by Jack Gold and shot in Avala, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). And it is very well structured and compellingly told. The first half gives us the portrayal of life in Sobibor: the daily routines of working in the sorting sheds, working in the fields, welcoming and prepping the newcomers (even if the actual truth of whats inevitable remains hidden, for the most part). The first half is indeed grim, but one can see the metamorphosis of the planning for the eventual, inevitable escape, even if the details remains to be ironed-out. Here, the key is in the acting, and Alan Arkin (Leon Feldhendler) is huge in playing the leadership role in not only coming up with the plan for an escape, but to do so meticulously and with care (as most inmates never used a gun, and with the situation as volatile as it is). He is also a spiritual leader, the one who keeps things among the prisoners in order and with calmness (or should I say, sanity, for the not knowing what is going to happen next must have been unnerving). But equally as compelling (and perhaps more) is Hartmut Becker as Staff Sergeant Wagner. Here does he really capture the ill-fated beliefs and ideology of those in charged in running the camp, and of the overall Nazi culture that swept across Germany at the time convincingly. This character is both menacing and evil, and Becker brings those attributes very well to the fore.

The second half of the film, much like The Great Escape (1963), concerns itself with the actual escape plans, which entails acquiring greater knowledge of the logistics of the camp and its surrounding areas, getting the inmates psychologically prepared for the escape as much as possible (which includes killing the guards as part of the escape, which many of them are adverse to gun violence), and recruiting those with knowledge of whats happening outside the camp. This is where Rutger Hauer comes in as Alexander 'Sasha' Pechersky, one of the Russian soldiers who becomes inmate of the camp. Leon sees Sasha as key to the escape plan and partner-up with him in figuring out ways to the escape. And it is clear that Leon is not at first totally at home with Sasha's plans, but eventually sees the necessary ingredients for the escape. Other characters prove crucial to the plan as well, namely Luka (Joanna Pacula), Samuel (Emil Wolk), and (Shlomo Simon Gregor).

This film is excellent and I cannot find fault in the acting by all involved, so authentic and faithful to the history of the camp it is. And while pictorially it must yield to Steven Spielbergs Schindler's List, this cinematic work is a major achievement. But if theres a qualm I must pick, its the decision to not include Rashke and Esther Raabs interview with Sander Vanocur of the History Channel. That would have been a great, absorbing encore to this overall compelling yet instructive presentation. And speaking of presentation, you may have to make sure that the version available here is complete. There were various re-releases of this film with cuts in them (around the mid-point in the film). Other than that, this movie is a must-get if you're going to get a more rounded picture of the dangers of unquestioned ideology and what effects it has on mankind.",932169600,97,3788,4.869767441860465

To  say that it was moving would be a huge understatement. Seeing the portrayal  of their victory and revenge against the Nazis, accompanied by two other  manifestations of their revenge in the persons of Tom's daughter and  Stanislaw's son, was an experience that will stay with me for the rest of  my life.
