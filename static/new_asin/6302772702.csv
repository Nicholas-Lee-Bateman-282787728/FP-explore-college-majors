8168337,5,6302772702,"This is one of many showcases of Russian ballet available on video, and the usual suspects show up:  Baryshnikov, Semenyaka, Vetrov, Pavlova (Nadezhda), Gordeeyev, Gracheva, etc.  As usual, the production values vary  from piece to piece, the dancing is excellent, and you see many of the same  ballets, but probably danced by somebody different than on your other  tapes.  This is nothing new.
So how do you choose which of these tapes to  buy (besides buying them all)?  Because of the occasional rare bits.  In  this tape, there are two such rare bits.  The first is an performance of  the ubiquitous Don Quixote pas de deux, danced by Baryshnikov and  Semenyaka, but it's rare because they're so young in it!  The other is a  solo for Ekaterina Maximova simply called ""Mazurka.""  The  choreography is a bit precious, but Maximova has great charm and exquisite  legs and feet.  I love her dancing because she has the precise technique  that the Bolshoi dancers currently embrace while retaining the very free  upper body movements that were the hallmark of older generations.
Some of  the aforementioned showcases of Russian ballet are ""The Magic of the  Kirov,"" ""Classic Ballet Night,"" ""Kirov Soloists -  Invitation to the Dance,"" ""Classic Kirov Performances,""  ""The Magic of the Bolshoi"" and the remaining volumes of this  ""Glorious Tradition"" series.",962150400,17,1356,5.077625570776256
