8155475,5,B000A7Q1OW,"I never thought I would live to see Otar Iosseliani's Georgian films on DVD with English subtitles. These films are rich with ideas and emotions, and they provide a unique perspective on Georgian culture while retaining a universal appeal. (I would say more about the films themselves, but I'm writing a review elsewhere.) The set includes: a student film, APRIL; his feature debut FALLING LEAVES; THERE WAS ONCE A SINGING BLACKBIRD and PASTORALE. The transfers are director-approved, using clean prints with good contrast and easy-to-read electronic subtitles. Maybe not Criterion-level transfers but quite good nonetheless, especially for Soviet-era films. A very satisfactory edition of must-see-films!",1127865600,26,705,5.723809523809524
