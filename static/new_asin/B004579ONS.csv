Tired of the taboo topics being swept under the rug and going around all the hard stuff instead of diving right into it.  I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and hardly ever review anything but this was a must.  I'm that impressed with these Recycle Your Faith Discussion Starters.  First off they WILL start a discussion within ANY group, believers or not, young or old.  The dvd was a dialogue I didn't want to end and it didn't with the people I shared this with.  It doesn't spoon feed you anything and discusses all the questions and thoughts we've all had.  Buy it, share it but don't lend it out because you may not get it back!  ; )",1291334400,,722,4.257352941176471
