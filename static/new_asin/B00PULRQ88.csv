8689306,4,B00PULRQ88,"It's about time we shed some light on the severe side if the autism spectrum.  This movie was well acted. The storyline was interesting.  There were a few things that could've made the movie much more believable.

As a parent of a severely autistic 21 yr old..it's never that easy to take your kid on a walk! Typically when having a ""meltdown"" it's not as easy as avoiding car alarms. Meltdowns triggers are often times a mystery and occur ""out of the blue""

There aren't any neighbors just dying to sit and watch your kids for free.  We have no respite because my sons behaviors are too extreme .",1428537600,3,597,4.440366972477064
