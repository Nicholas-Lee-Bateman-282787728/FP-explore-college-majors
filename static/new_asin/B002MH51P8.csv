8373894,5,B002MH51P8,I got a chance to see this film at a screening in Boston and I loved it! It plays like a dark drama. don't worry Horror fans it's definitely a Horror film. It's like a gangster film meets horror film. Great idea if you ask me. The acting is good the look of the film is great. If you want to see something new then Livestock Is worth a look.,1252022400,,341,3.8857142857142857
8373895,5,B002MH51P8,If you like horror you will enjoy Livestock. The first scene is brilliant. It drew me right into the movie. The art work was awesome. Livestock is a low budget film. I would like to see what Christopher DiNunzio could do with a bigger budget to make a movie.,1251072000,,258,4.285714285714286
8373896,4,B002MH51P8,I really liked Livestock a lot. The colors in this film are great! Some of the shots used are amazing and the Fx are good too. I found this film to be very original which is such a great and refreshing thing to see these days(I HATE REMAKES!). I liked the script it combined two cool ideas and made them work. It's kinda hard for me to talk about Livestock without giving too much away. Like I said it's an interesting film and does so many things right but I just can't say too much about it. If you're into Indie films then you should check it out. New update I own this movie and it has a great plot very interesting twist to a vampire movie.,1250985600,,645,4.086614173228346
8373897,4,B002MH51P8,"Livestock is not your average film and I can't say too much about it without giving it all away...to be sure, you will love this movie.",1250899200,2,135,4.230769230769231
