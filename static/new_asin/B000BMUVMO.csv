Worse, on more than one occasion the songs are cut off before the climax or ending of the song that Sammy is singing.  Do not buy this DVD.  There are others that are much better!",1521504000,,300,4.584905660377358

8179847,4,B000BMUVMO,"My Mom loved Sammy Davis. Watching this short, sometimes grainy (due to the age of the content being reproduced, not the quality of the DVD recording) but touching half hour, truly gives insight into the energy, the diverse and immense talent, the depth and a few surprises about a legendary entertainer and member of the Rat Pack. It also shows how close he seemed to be with Sinatra, Martin, and the rest. You can just tell there was no lack of respect between them due to talent, race or even stature. At least it seems so. It's an enjoyable piece with good music, a few laughs and worth it if you are a fan.",1376956800,,611,4.368421052631579
