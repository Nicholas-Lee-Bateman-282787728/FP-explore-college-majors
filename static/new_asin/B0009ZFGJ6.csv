I had thought that there might at least be subtitles or a vocal track in German, since nearly all the action takes place in the German empire of World War II.  NO! NYET! berhaupt NICHT! You either understand spoken Russian, or you read Russian, or you are out in the cold!  There supposedly is a version of this production that DOES have English subtitles, but this offering is NOT it!  You have been warned!

Also do NOT try to download a ""subtitle"" for insertion from the internet, either.  A friend of mine tried to do this on someone else's computer and this only produced a VIRUS so horrible that not even two excellent computer technicians could get rid of it.  The entire operating system will have to be loaded from scratch with the loss of everything on the computer as a consequence.

Oh, and although ""Shield and Sword"" appears in four sections on YouTube, the Russian production company has blocked all access to it.  So, if you want to watch this movie, which is spoken of as being Vladimir Putin's inspiration for joining the KGB, forget it, unless you can at least read or understand Russian.",1418342400,6,1188,4.619047619047619
