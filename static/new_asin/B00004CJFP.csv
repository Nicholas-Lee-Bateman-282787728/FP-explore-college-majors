1339355,5,B00004CJFP,I just got this today on DVD. I never watched the show when it was on TV. I see from some of the other reviews that they changed it around on the DVD. So I really can't say anything about that sense I never saw it on PBS. Also in my opinon the video quality is fine to for an older program put on DVD.I do think it is a informative collection on the plants and animals on our plant. I think if you really love nature then you will love this DVD set. I just love the way it is packaged and it's case it comes in too. I like all the shows David Attenborough has done so this is one of the best.,1118188800,6,592,3.744
1339356,3,B00004CJFP,"This series was originally aired on PBS in the mid 1980s and was groundbreaking.  It set a new standard for nature documentary.  I was excited to see it released on DVD.

Given the apparent age and material of the source for the transfer (it looks to me like the DVD was made from a videotaped copy of the original film stock, and the video tape probably sat in a storage room somewhere for 15+ years), I think one needs to make allowances for a diminished sound and picture quality, but I really wonder who thought it was a good idea to change the order of episodes. The way Sir David originally wrote and performed the voice-overs for the ends of each episode was as a tie-in to the next, so that there would be a sort of cliff-hanger, but also a continuity to the whole series.  Some idiot at Time/Life must have thought he/she knew better than Sir Attenborough how the shows should be ordered, so they cut those parts out. The result is very abrupt and startling endings to the shows--sometimes in mid-sentence! Why? This makes no sense at all.

I hope that someone comes to their senses and these classic shows get re-released without the stupid edits, and with the shows in their proper order.",1102982400,173,1199,4.506912442396313

The quality of the picture reminds me an ugly 16mm footage transferred to U-Matic, the noise is umbeareable. Non talking about the poor quality of the sound and the music made with synthetizers from the early seventies.

Same price as prime new series like The Life of Birds, The Life of Mammals, Seas of Life, not worth the price.",1092873600,44,479,4.505747126436781
1339358,5,B00004CJFP,"If made with today's technology this series would rank as the best nature series ever produced.  Despite its age-related flaws (Video Quality, Soundtrack, Chopping Block), this DVD series still rates the full 5 stars.  It features a younger, spryer David Attenborough exploring a planet teeming with life.  Attenborough is the ultimate ecology teacher - he guides the viewer through the various biomes of the earth, picking out a variety of amazing phenomena to show us, and he lets us soak in the beauty of each realm.  Rather than focusing on birds or mammals, we learn about the whole spectrum of the natural world, from fish to fungi, insects to people.  The information is always interesting, and presented in modest amounts - it never becomes a bore.

What he has done is a quantum leap beyond anything else in the ""nature show"" category.  The depth, breadth and brilliance of this series is unparralled.

1339394,4,B00004CJFP,"""The Living Planet"" doesn't bring back as many childhood memories as ""Life on Earth"". Too unwieldy? Or just too much? But sure, the concept is similar: Attenborough, daring as usual, criss-crosses the world, showing us pretty much everything from charismatic megafauna to seemingly trivial stuff such as dandelions or ballooning spiders. I admit that for some strange psychological reason, ""The Living Planet"" didn't thrill me as much as other documentaries featuring The Man, but I nevertheless feel forced to give this staggering achievement in the history of nature documentaries (and, I suppose, the world) four stars.

They're really wonderful, even ingenious in the way it paints a picture of how each environment works, and how it shows off the unique beauty of each subject. I tried putting it on as background noise while I was working, but ended up staring at the screen the whole time. This series really has something special that other nature documentaries do not.

1339397,4,B00004CJFP,"This early Attenborough is great. the info, as far as i can tell, isn't incorrect, and the material is different enough from 'planet Earth' to justify buying both. It is cool to see a younger Attenborough. Unfortunately, Time Life Video messed up! First of all, all of the documentaries are out of the original order. But more importantly, Time Life, for some odd reason, cut out Attenborough's ending speech, where he says something like: ""And that's what we'll see in the next episode"". In the second to last episode (about the ocean) they even cut him off mid sentence! However, if you ignore that, these videos are great.",1313193600,,625,4.796296296296297
1339398,3,B00004CJFP,"The picture quality is the muddiest I've encountered on a DVD from a major production company.  Shame on TIME-LIFE: I have 30 year old BETAMAX  video tapes with better picture quality.  Viewers born after the advent of the digital age may find the poor quality transfer off-putting.  As well they should considering the hefty  price tag of this multi-disc set from TIME-LIFE.

Most unforgiveable, however, was TIME-LIFE's decision to alter the chronological order of the series and to edit portions of Attenbourgh's closing monologues at the end of each particular episode.  Because the order of the series has been shuffled, at the end of each episode, Attenbourgh's closing remarks and his introduction to the upcoming program in the series has been heavily edited.  Inexcusable.  Otherwise, this seminal nature documentary would make a fine edition to any video library.

5 stars (*****) for Attenbourgh's original vision;  1 (*) stars for the quality of the print and TIME-LIFE's inexplicable editing.",1304553600,4,1005,5.2974683544303796

1339400,4,B00004CJFP,"If wildlife film making was considered ""classical art"", Sir David Attenborough must surely be the Leonardo Da Vinci of the trade.
And if so, the Living Planet is comparable to the Last Supper. I would put Life on Earth as the equivalent of Mona Lisa.

Good artwork leaves you dumb-founded. Held motionless in a state of bliss, I suppose.
I don't think words can do justice to the importance and the elegance of the project, but I *AM* furious with the BBC and TIME-WARNER.
This is a classic work of art, so, why not treat it as such?
Why not try a little restoration as they do on the temples, eh?
There are two MAJOR complaints against this series:
a) EPISODES OUT OF SEQUENCE
  Why on earth do they have to jumble up the episodes? Why can't the episodes be in the same sequence as they were originally aired? That created a unique flow, which is ultra-important in a documentary
b) FANTASTICALLY BAD PICTURE QUALITY... why does BBC continue to do this? I have had the same complaints with Life On Earth, Attenborough In Paradise, etc.

1339413,5,B00004CJFP,"This is the second in David Attenborough big nature television series works. 12 episodes long the template is based on `Life on Earth' and follows a similar pattern of the presenter encountering nature around our planet.

Life on Earth was about the evolution of life starting with a barren earth and working through the increase of the complexity of life. The Living Planet takes a look at how species adapt to a wide range of environments across Earth. It involves more areas of earth science such as geology, climatology and environmental science. It is also about the life cycle of many organisms from their birth to their death. There is lots of predator prey interaction and more about how humans deal with these conditions.

Each episode ends with a change in the environment and moves onto a new one for the next. I would certainly try to watch `Life on Earth' before you watch this although it does work as a standalone series it is more like a closer look at the forms of life in `Life on Earth' while integrating their stories with the movement and activity of the Earth.

Like `Life on Earth' there is a wealth of natural knowledge that is overwhelming and is one of the finest nature programs ever made. It is another fine example of why David Attenborough is the world's leading presenter of nature. After you have finished watching this, move onto his next series `The Trials of Earth' although he did do some other unrelated works in-between.

1339418,5,B00004CJFP,"This set has hours of clean, educational material.  I find it very relaxing to turn on my system and just let the discs play.  There are 720 minutes (12 hours) of programming, so it's a great value.

In other reviews, I see a lot of concern for quality and sound.  Yes, this is not some Hollywood HD-DVD fast-action movie in 3D.  It's just a tour through the wonders of nature in our world.  The quality is still very crisp and clean.  There are no major artifacts or broken audio.

The content is very interesting.  It's one of the few nature programs today without ""tree-hugger drama"".  So many nature programs put up a front of teaching you about nature, but end up being a political show or a show about the scientists themselves.  I personally think David Attenborough's approach of treasuring nature while we have it is much more effective.

I also think it is a great show for children.  There are so many animals and regions of the world (cold forests, valcanoes, oceans, etc).  It's a feast for young minds.",1163203200,10,1016,4.572222222222222

1339420,2,B00004CJFP,"David Attenborough is an extraordinary naturalist.  Nonetheless, this series is lacking, not because of the content or Attenborough's presentation, but because it is so old.  The DVD's are new, but the series is from the 1980's and therefore outdated.  If that is OK with you, then go for it.  Otherwise, I suggest you consider the ""Life Series"" by the BBC, Attenborough, and company from the Amazon UK site (Region 2 DVD's).",1158969600,9,425,4.943661971830986
1339421,4,B00004CJFP,"I originally saw the original U.S. run of The Living Planet on PBS back in the spring of 1985.  I was absolutely mesmerized by this series.  I was into all things natural history and filmmaking and this series did it for me!  It still is my all-time favorite natural history series.

I recently purchased the R1 DVD set and am reliving those fantastic times I had when I watched it over 20 years ago.  The information is still relevant although we can think back over 20 years to see how things have progressed from the time David Attenborough made this show.

I would have given the show 5 stars (absolutely nothing wrong with the content mind you) BUT someone decided to put the individual episodes on the discs in the wrong order!!!!  Why in the world did they do this?  The original show was presented in an order which made sense, for example, Attenborough begins with the Building of the Earth and then moves on to the high frozen mountains, then goes to the Northern Forests and subsequently into the jungles and then the grasslands, etc.  In the R1 version of the DVD, they totally are out of order!!!  Makes me sick to think that they actually came up with this idea.  The original shows usually had a short teaser line by Sir David at the end of each episode indicating where we were going in the next episode, as a reviewer already stated before, these were edited out and the endings of the episodes come fast and just end. Just no excuse to do that.

But, what I am doing is watching them in the correct order to enjoy the episodes as they were meant to be seen.

One other thing, if you really want to enjoy this series, then find the book called The Making of the Living Planet by Andrew Langley. This book was published in 1985 and details all that went into the making of the series mostly from the cameraman's viewpoint.  It has totally opened my eyes as to how they shoot these things and what specifically went into making the Living Planet.  I will never watch it again in the same way now that I know the behind the scenes of it!",1156204800,15,2051,4.388888888888889
1339422,4,B00004CJFP,"This collection of The Living Planet series appears to be one of the first of David Attenborough and is a ""gateway"" of sorts to the many wonderful life of series from the BBC.  The transfer could use some cleaning up, but that seems to be my only complaint.  The series is interesting, enlightening, and thoroughly informative.  At times David Attenborough is discussing issues that are now being addressed by Al Gore in An Inconvenient Truth.  Keep in mind, this series is at least 22 years old.  I feel anyone who loves David Attenborough and the other series he is involved with (Recommend The Blue Planet, Life of Mammals, Life of Birds, and Life in the Undergrowth) will love this classic too.

The information isn't quite up to date (it's 40+ years old) like David's more recent works.
But from an educational standpoint, these programs are more packed with in-depth knowledge of animals that sadly, David has reduced his teaching. (He probably expects we already know)
There are some preachy moments and hard truths included. But he gives it to you straight. I'd suggest this to any Attenborough fan. It was very welcome in my collection of 15 Attenborough DVDs ...certainly worth $19.95",1524873600,,715,5.119658119658119

7920032,3,B00004CJFP,"This was one of the programs I watched as a child and lead to a lot of my interest in nature(besides camping/scouts) and probably my interest in nature shows. This series is one of the best because it's not overproduced like all of the nature shows since the ""Blue Planet"" series(no ""extra content"" garbage like what some film crew went through with fake drama nonsense) and it has a much smaller amount of misanthrope global destruction propaganda as well. It's also better because back then CGI was so basic that you can see right through it here, just see where they present their ""satellite"" shots of Earth, hilariously bad fakery! Also see the ocean bed mountains models lol.  In short they had to be much more honest and do real legwork instead of the CGI computer and in studio stuff that has really taken over in the latest series like Planet Earth II, which had CGI in the mud waterfall shots and in other places. In Planet Earth I they even did one of those tacked on extra content features that showed the CGI they did with the extended plant growth shots! In Life in the Undergrowth they have CGI insects to ""prove"" their very shaky, if outright false, Royal Society/government approved ""science"". To be fair it wasn't presented as real, unlike the satellite shots in this series were. I don't know how anyone can trust the ""facts"" the BBC presents anymore! I would put the BBC on par with trustworthy networks like CNN and FOX!

All that being said the minimalism is a welcome refreshment from the way too hollywood ""nature"" series we get today. High Def today is nice but that doesn't make up for the annoying fake sound(there's no microphones in deep underwater and other places) and unavoidable 20 min vignettes of the ""crew"" at the end of each installment. It's kind of like the History Channel was a real channel when it started then it became Nazis, aliens and history of underpants type of stuff. This series has minimal amount to none of that stuff. I will say that the diving suit audio is really bad dubbing after the fact, Attenborough(script reader like any other) acted out the motions so the dubbing would look real. Also Attenb has his really weird body motions while speaking into the camera, yeah bet he's a normal kind of guy! As all ""sirs"" are sure! If you watch all of old Atty's series there are set pieces used over and over like the bird that breaks bones by dropping them, I think the Lamaguya bird and other go to repeats.

There's a definite narrative of survival of the fittest(NOT proved Darwinism philosophy) being pushed in all of these series which simply is not true. Animals need to eat and drink to survive but so did the Native Americans, did the ""fittest"" scenario come in there? Would the women and children survive long if they weren't protected and given special status in a cooperative tribe? Where is the ""fight"" in there? Animals don't murder and they don't store food except in pretty small amounts in special cases. How is a first born who is favored in some species the ""fittest"" by simply the order of birth? Is the ""fittest"" simply those who survive? Most of this is about programming humans and has nothing to do with straight facts but theories assumed to be true and presented over and over as true. Animals need to be controlled and if necessary put in cages as well as be sacrificed, as per Darwin you are nothing but an animal ergo the ""fittest"" aka the rich and powerful have the right to do all these things to everyone below them, congratulations.

 Still this is one of the more honest nature shows out there and has the nice lack of blaring flashiness we get today so it's recommended. Just do your best to filter out the global destruction propaganda and the fake CGI/satellite and the other hairbrained THEORIES that they present over and over and over as facts.",1498089600,,3835,4.617302052785924
