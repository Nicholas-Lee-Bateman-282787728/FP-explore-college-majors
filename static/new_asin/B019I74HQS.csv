7575859,5,B019I74HQS,"25 years ago, I was 15 (as the same age of Si'r). I went to see this movie in a brighter summer day. Since then, I became a fan of Edward Yang. 25 years later, thanks for Criterion Collection's terrific restoration, I can watch it on my TV, with the best quality that beyond my expectation. With this edition, I have found many details that I've never noticed before on the silver screen, not to mention the poor VCD edition.

Thank Edward Yang for creating this fantastic film, and thank Criterion Collection for reviving it again.",1459296000,23,532,4.541666666666667
