8494838,5,B000OFOLWO,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: I believe this was WNTW's first time featuring twins and it was a big success. Early on, Valerie and Veronica seemed soft-spoken and shy, but they got more comfortable as the show went on, offered good observations about their situations, and had a lot of fun with S and C. It was really interesting how their unique personalities led to them choosing different types of clothes; having them shop the same store separately was a masterstroke (and not letting them see each other until the end of hair and makeup was effective, too). And it really helped that the production staff ID'd which twin was which as often as it did, because although cute as all get out, they began the show nearly impossible to tell apart.
3) Oh yeah, the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. Yet if you spring for this ep you certainly will enjoy it.
