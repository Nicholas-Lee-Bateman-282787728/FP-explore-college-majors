7921825,2,B00004S89M,"The DVD is 84 minutes. Half of them are computer animated morphed pictures. For my sense that's not suitable for the silent underwater world. The ""normal"" second part of the DVD is ok. But i wouldn't buy the DVD a second time. The film sequences are not of very professional quality. Not so sharp... There are better DVDs of the underwater world.",1045094400,10,346,4.596774193548387
7921826,5,B00004S89M,The kalidoscope side of this DVD is my very favorite for listening to music. I usually play my own CD's and watch it as you would watch a fire while listening to music. The effect is so fabulous that many of my friends have bought the DVD after seeing it at my house. It is a bit like a 60's light show in that the beautiful patterns stimulate your imagination. I pity the people who wrote negative reviews who must be totally unable to let their minds go into the experience. This is my #1 favorite DVD.,1010361600,,504,4.206185567010309
7921827,1,B00004S89M,"This DVD consists of two parts. 50% of the time (some 20-odd minutes) is screen-saver type entertainment: Kaleidoscopic images that one shouldn't be looking at for too long (advice for any type of screen saver), but then perhaps the idea is not to watch it continously.
My real complaint concerns the second part: underwater scenes acompanied by music, or at least that's you would expect it to be. However, it would fairer to say that the creators seem to have chosen the music first, and then ADAPTED the visuals to the beat. Since virtually all the music is fairly fast-paced, the producer SPEEDED UP all the scenes. By using this trick, this DVD ceases to be a nature production and becomes more like a music video, which is fair enough. The problem is just that the DVD is promoted for its marine life and underwater footage. Anyone who has been diving knows that the charm of the subaquatic experience is the SLOWNESS of everything, allowing time to enjoy the details of everything in your path. One should never, as this DVD imitates, speed along the bottom like a torpedo if you want to discover the magic of the sea.
So don't buy this DVD if you are looking for a dry dive, but by all means do if you are looking for a rather special mood creator for a funky party.",982972800,25,1274,4.51948051948052
7921828,2,B00004S89M,"I bought this video expecting to have a crisp picture quality on my 36 inch HDTV, similar to what I would see on my salt water aquarium....boy was I wrong.  The picture quality was very poor, at times grainy.  Although the hypnotic music was very relaxing, I could not get pass the picture.  Also, I was expecting a more flowing camera shot; instead, the camera would focus on one fish aspect for 6 seconds and then continue on to the next.  Overall, if picture quality is the reason for buying this DVD, then do not buy it.",982022400,7,524,4.371134020618556
7921829,5,B00004S89M,"This DVD contains only two totally different sections:  The Kaleidoscope and the Underwater Realm.
I initially watched the Underwater Realm section of the DVD and it displayed a pretty outstanding and very clear underwater footage.  It doesn't make you think that you are diving and snorkeling but makes you aware that you have a huge saltwater aquarium instead of a TV.
As it is, this section is nice to be run when you are doing something else and then just look at it when something catches your eye.  It is not for watching head-on but something as a sideline when you are on some other task (like maybe making out hehehe).
You can say it is like ambient music for the eyes and at the same time they are background visuals for the accompanying soundtrack.
Then I ran the Liquid Realm section and oh boy was it mindblowing.  This section is the best while you are 'up there' *wink* *wink*.  I had the living room lights turned off and just watch the colors and the sounds melding from one thing to another.  There is a rhythmical sense to all of it when you watch it head-on.  And if you are in the proper frame of mind it is very easy to slip into the pool of light and hues and aural sensations and be part of the show and relax. Sensual escapism at its best.
All in all, it is a no-frills DVD but then again it is absolutely great for what whatever it is supposed to do as long as you know how to use it.",979084800,6,1410,4.258426966292135
