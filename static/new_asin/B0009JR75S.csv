8062084,5,B0009JR75S,"This disc features a fine performance and recording of Tchaikovsky's Piano Trio. The rest of the disc contains one piece featuring each of the three musicians. Berezovsky starts the concert off with a melting performance of the Barcarolle for piano from The Seasons. This is followed by the cellist, Alexander Kniazev follows with a passionate performance of the Nocturne in d minor and Dmitri Makhtin ends the concert with an attractive performance of the Serenade Melancolique for violin.

The Trio is the main item of course and is placed centrally. It is given the sort of performance that one would expect from three Russian players of this calibre. As a result they rise to the passionate moments with typical Russian fire and emotional commitment and play the more reflective passages with sensitivity and with some melting tonal qualities. This is far better played and recorded than the rival version from the Miami Piano Festival and available on VIA and is clearly the version to buy.

The recording quality is excellent with crisp and involving imaging where the remote camera work is totally sympathetic. The sound is particularly realistic as is the case with all the discs in this series of concerts. In this case the sound is presented in DTS 5.1, Dolby digital 5.1 and stereo.

Further note on this series available from Amazon.co.uk as below:

The series of concerts at the Roque d'Antheron has been recorded within a specially built recording venue which features state of the art recording facilities producing wonderful piano sound and sympathetic remotely controlled camera work. The intention was to record outstanding recitals each year and to release them on DVD. In reality this project seems to have stalled with only a handful of issues released in 2002 and 2004. But what riches they contain! This is as good a place to start as any. Once you have one you will want them all. There are 13 and the titles are spread around but not usually under the artists, the music or the venue. At the moment the most effective search on Amazon has been to choose the category `Film & TV' then search 'naive dvd' within it. You will then find most of the series is listed. A wonderful collection of great artistic and recorded merit.

Outstanding recitalists in the series, featuring several previously unknown to me, include Boris Berezovsky, Frank Braley, Eliso Virsaladze, Francesco Libetta, Frederic Guy, Nicolai Luganski, Paul Lewis, Vanessa Wagner, Zoltan Kocsis and the Ivaldi / Pennetier duo",1343520000,,2514,5.0047846889952154
