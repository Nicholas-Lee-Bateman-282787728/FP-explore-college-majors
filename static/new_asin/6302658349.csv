494406,5,6302658349,I was very pleased with my order.  My order exceeded my expectations.  I think this is a good movie.  The movie has several twists to it so you have to be paying attention.,1390780800,,172,4.151515151515151

494408,5,6302658349,"Another good performance of Jaclyn Smith's.. She is positive that her husband is cheating on her, so she does the same thing.. Lots of twists and turns in this movie.. Hope you also enjoy it..",1377043200,,192,4.514285714285714
494409,4,6302658349,I liked how the actress played all 3 men. Nobody would have expected her that from her. she is a great actress.,1372204800,,111,4.090909090909091
494410,4,6302658349,"I remember seeing this on TV a few years back and enjoyed the twisty storyline.  Beautiful people, scenery and enough romance and revenge to satisfy especially if you are a fan of Jaclyn Smith who always is great to look at and excels in this sort of made for TV movie.  I enjoyed it for what it is- a simple easy to watch 'chick flick'- although not outstanding drama.",1371600000,3,369,4.333333333333333
494411,5,6302658349,"I love this movie.  Jaclyn Smith gave a wonderful performance, in fact it was the best that I've ever seen her.  The story had a great twist, even if the ending was not completely satisfying.  It left me wondering what happened to her marriage. The VHS that I purchased from Amazon.com was in pretty good condition.",1317945600,3,315,4.589285714285714
494412,4,6302658349,I ordered this movie thinking it was a retitled version of Nightmare in the Daytime.  That was the name I input and the movie I purchased came up.  Unfortunately it was not the movie in a retitled version.  I did recieve the movie listed in a reasonable time and in good condition.  The problem apparently lay with whomever placed in under the listing Nightmare in the Daytime.,1312156800,4,377,4.582089552238806
494413,5,6302658349,"Everyone is this movie does a great job. I initially watched it for Nick Mancuso (dark and charming and compelling here as always), but was impressed with the plot machinations, notably by Jaclyn Smith, whose performance is complex but understated. The basic plot -- Smith finds out her husband Gazzara has cheated on her, and asks reporter Mancuso to look into it, but when the next phase is blackmail, and then the girl ends up dead with Gazzara as suspect, well, a lot of twisting goes on, some of which involves Greg Evigan, and some of which involves Smith herself.  Mancuso fans will love him here, but really, everyone put in a good day's work.",1224979200,13,651,4.660869565217391
494414,5,6302658349,"I really enjoyed watching this film. Jaclyn Smith's never been better and sexier. She's absolutely fantastic! I've never seen her sexier in her movies and this is a chilling and a razor sharp drama thriller at every turn.
Fans of Jaclyn will probably remember that the house shown in the film is the same house where they shot the Charlie's Angels epsiode ""One Love, Two Angels.""",1058572800,9,379,4.757575757575758

7829399,2,6302658349,This movie was not that good. I'm glad I didn't buy it. It was terribly written...and it wasn't that suspenseful. The ending was kind of a let down. To hear it all explained at the end was disappointing.,1468195200,,203,4.368421052631579
