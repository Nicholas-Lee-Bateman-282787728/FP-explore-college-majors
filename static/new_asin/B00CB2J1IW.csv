5710893,5,B00CB2J1IW,"Decades of advertising by the meat and dairy industries have us brainwashed about the true function and source of protein in our diets. This 30 minute video explains what protein is and WHERE IT IS FOUND, i.e., *all* foods including low fat plants. It also notes that humans are not rats (most nutritional data regarding protein is based on RATS tesing). Overall this short and concise video doesn't take itself too seriously and there's quite a bit of comic relief.
Most heplful is a list of all common foods eaten in this contry and how they compare in protein and fat content based on *calories - not weight*.Basing on weight is very misleading, as you'll see.
 Highly recommended for everyone.",1369958400,5,697,4.808333333333334
8579555,4,B00CB2J1IW,"This would have been a 5-star, if the actors weren't so bad, and the man-boobs weren't thrown in my face. The beginning is disgusting, skip it. I honestly thought her hands were going to grab his boobs, which kept jiggling. I'm going to have to watch something else to get that out of my memory just to sleep! Horrible. The information was good, and I learned something new. A must watch for any non-rat human.",1504483200,,410,4.48
8579556,5,B00CB2J1IW,"This was a very quick, interesting look at protein, where it comes from, and how much humans really need.  I'd read a lot of this research previously, but I still learned a few new things and found the format to be delightfully straightforward and comical.

A perfect little documentary for vegetarians to send to all their concerned friends and relatives who constantly warn them that they're going to perish from lack of protein!",1498521600,,431,4.890410958904109

8579560,5,B00CB2J1IW,"Dude, you said it all!  Super clear, thorough and fast paced info.  But I did just get a ""normal"" protein score after eating only plant foods for over two years, so you for sure don't have to eat meat to get up to the normal level, FYI.",1491264000,,236,4.0
