8359640,5,B002AK9UR2,"Busytown Mysteries have become a favorite around our house. This DVD is no exception. I noticed that the description did not state which episodes are on this DVD.
They are:
The Mystery of the Lost Parrot (from season 1 episode 3)
The Monster Mystery (from season 1 episode 3)
The Lighthouse Ghost Mystery (from season 1 episode 4)
Cornfield Confusion (from season 1 episode 4)
The Silly Scarecrow Mystery (from season 1 episode 22)
The Disappearing Home Mystery. (from season 1 episode 21)

It is just over and hour long.  We love the critical thinking that the show teaches. There is no violence, no sassy kids, just a nice family friendly cartoon for younger children. Our son is 4 now but his older cousins who are 6 and 8 love to watch this series too. The older one likes to try and guess the answer and hear her pointing out things in the show. We are looking forward to getting more from this series.",1386201600,7,907,4.524390243902439
8359641,5,B002AK9UR2,"My 5 year olds love this series!  It teaches them logic and problem-solving, and does not use any scary situations that could freak my kids out (thanks, Disney's ""Brave"" for terrifying my kids!)  Anyway, I ended up buying more of these DVDS, and recommend them.",1369440000,,261,4.777777777777778
8359642,5,B002AK9UR2,"my son loves busy town. highly reconmend this children's show, as it is one of the VERY few a can actually tolerate to watch and not cringe.",1333670400,,140,4.222222222222222
8359643,5,B002AK9UR2,"Great adaptation of the Richard Scarry books into video. Each mystery is fun and not too scary, no pun intended. My daughter doesn't even know she is learning reasoning and critical thinking she just enjoys the video. Each episode is about 10 minutes long so it will hold the attention of the younger set, my daughter is 6. Clean and wholesome, plus it reminds me of my childhood books.",1309305600,2,386,4.608695652173913
