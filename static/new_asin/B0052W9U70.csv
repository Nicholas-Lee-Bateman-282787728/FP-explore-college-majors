8454526,4,B0052W9U70,"I'm a huge Scooby Doo fan so this may be biased!  A modern , techie adventure for the gang with the normal humor, chases, and the culprit being caught by the meddling kids!  One to add to your collection!",1404691200,2,204,4.205128205128205

8454528,1,B0052W9U70,"If you have bought ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You? The Complete 1st ad 2nd Season"" and all 3 seasons of ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" Don't be a sucker and buy this cause they got a new cover. This is WB way of trying to get more money off people cause they hope no one will think about looking at the back or paying too close attention to what's on the back. The episodes on this come from one of the 2 series I mentioned. There is a total of 3. ""Go West, Young Scooby"" and ""Gentlemen, Start Your Monster"" come from ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" and ""Foul Play in Funland"" is from the first season of ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You?"". So if you got any of the seasons don't buy this and if you don't buy them instead of wasting your money for 3 episodes, especially if you're a Scooby fan. Happy shopping.",1314489600,59,788,4.26
