8051643,3,B0007TKG0I,"Watching this movie, you can believe that you are standing in the middle of a trailer park. It has the drama and cheese that you can imagine. If you want to see a melodramatic portrayal of the interpersonal dynamics of a WV trailer park, this movie is definitely for you!!",1286064000,,272,4.46
