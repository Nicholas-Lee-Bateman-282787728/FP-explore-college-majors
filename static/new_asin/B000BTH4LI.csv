2440582,5,B000BTH4LI,"Here is a martial artist's martial arts film!

You will enjoy it!

Awesome scenery, and MUSIC!  Where do I get a copy of the Music??

Vision, clarity, true action sequences, thoughtful and beautiful staging.  Respect, truth and honor, as well as tradition are what make this a memorable film;  blood and guts and glory take a back seat and we do not miss them!

An honorable film by an honorable man.",1147305600,6,400,4.549295774647887

2440614,2,B000BTH4LI,"Badly scripted, badly directed, badly acted.  There's really nothing more to be said:  The only reason I give it two stars is the mental calligraphy element; but, when it finally comes to ink on paper, even the calligraphy is badly done.",1379289600,,237,4.7560975609756095

2440616,5,B000BTH4LI,this was a wonderful movie and was very realistic with what a true (zen) master's life would have been like...,1372377600,,110,4.55
2440617,2,B000BTH4LI,I think there was an idea here for a movie that may have been 10 minutes long and they added slow filler to make up the rest of the time.  Too bad I didn't have a fast forward button. Might have made the movie make more sense.,1368489600,,226,3.8085106382978724
2440618,5,B000BTH4LI,"Having read some of Mr. Sang H. Kim's instructional martial arts books, I came to Zen Man expecting a true to life account of martial arts and what they mean. I was not in the least bit disappointed. Make no mistake, you are not going to find the kind of over-the-top fight scenes one associates with a wuxia-style film or Hollywood blockbuster. The action is very real, demonstrating Mr. Kim's amazing talent and knowledge. But it is everything behind the action that makes this film work so well. The character of Han comes off as a solitary, almost distant individual, yet so incredibly likable. What he does not express with words, he expresses through other means, which really makes the viewer feel they understand his motivations better, even when he says nothing. The other characters or not quite as remarkable as Han, but this does not detract from the enjoyment of the film. The only real criticism I can think of, and I'm really digging deep here, is that the main villain is not very well explained, other than that he is simply a really bad guy. That said, it isn't that important either. After all, the focus here is on Han, and to a lesser extent Antonio. I feel it is through Han's eyes that the viewer experiences the story, so having other characters not so well established is quite forgivable.

Overall, I feel that Zen Man is something of a niche title, a film that will probably appeal to aspiring martial artists more than anyone else. It doesn't have the flash to earn it any mainstream success (which I think is a shame), but those who are touched by it will love it forever. And I should mention that the musical score is simply amazing, well worth the price of admission in itself. I would highly recommend buying both the film and the soundtrack together.

I only hope that Mr. Kim will work on another project like this in the future. Thanks for reading.",1254096000,3,1884,4.604166666666667
2440619,5,B000BTH4LI,"This is an entertaining, suspenseful, and thought provoking film that is a liberating study in Zen. Between the beautiful cinematography, the intriguing storyline, and Han's skillful martial arts scenes emerge the lessons of honor, respect, revenge, and truth. Not since the TV series Kung Fu years ago with the Master and ""grasshopper"" has there been entertainment that delves beneath the surface to enrich the viewer through an exercise in enlightenment. Zen Man does this masterfully.",1174262400,2,487,5.506666666666667
2440620,5,B000BTH4LI,Great Entertainment. Realistic fight scenes with a lot of emotion. Great performances by all Main characters. Really interesting story and very good action for an independent film.,1149724800,3,180,5.703703703703703
2440621,5,B000BTH4LI,"Zen Man reminds me of a Billy Jack type film. Occasionally, I noticed that with more budget more could have been done in the chasing scenes but boy, it still is impressive for an independent film. This is a beautifully filmed movie, showing real fighting action. You don't really find that kind of movie too much anymore. I give it five stars.",1149465600,,343,4.548387096774194
2440622,5,B000BTH4LI,I was very pleased that the Making of Zen Man on Disc 2 explained the background stories of the movie. I watched the movie again afterward and it makes a lot more sense now. I wanted to see more fights between Mugabi and Han but the final confrontation ended so quickly. But I guess if the ending were longer it would be dragging out the story. The opening fight is superb but the highlight is at the end when Han fights against Dan. Han's spinning hooking kick to Dan's head is something I've never seen. Zen Man is truly a great movie.,1149120000,3,537,4.2745098039215685
2440633,4,B000BTH4LI,"I had the pleasure of meeting Sang Kim when he was about half way through shooting Zen Man. I enjoyed spending three days with him and found him to be an immensely interesting man, comical, and intense in his approach to film making and in his life-long love of the martial arts.

While Zen Man is Sang's first movie (he has appeared in dozens of martial arts training videos and DVDs), his advanced education in film making shows in nearly every frame. There are several images of water, landscape, calligraphy, and even fog in a cemetery that Sang and his crew shot beautifully, all captured by an artist with an eye for what makes the viewer go ""Wow.""

As the title implies, Zen Man is about one man's philosophy, but there are several fight scenes for the martial arts fan. Sang displays his incredible kicking ability (his knockout hook kick toward the end of the movie is worth the price of admission), grappling, and stick work in several well-done scenes. His work with the long pole and single and double short sticks is extremely good.

Zen Man, written by Sang and Cynthia Kim, starring and directed by Sang Kim, is a wonderful first movie effort. Sang has a definite screen presence and his directing and cinematography has moments of true mastery.

As others have said here, it will be fun to see Sang's and Cynthia's next movie project.",1148169600,3,1350,4.659663865546219
2440634,4,B000BTH4LI,I'm a big fan of Master Kim and his instructional videos. I was happy to find out that he made a movie. He does a great job in putting this movie together. The scenery was breathtaking. I especially loved Master Kim's acting. I believe he has a lot of heart and loves to share all that he has experienced to teach others to make this world a better place. I'm looking forward to your next project Master Kim.,1148083200,3,408,4.243589743589744
2440635,4,B000BTH4LI,"I'm not a big fan of the ""martial arts movie"" however,I am interested in philosophy and different cultures.

The violence was not overdone as in some movies of this genre, The philosophy was the more important facet. I was reminded of the TV series with David Carradine. The scenery and the music were a great backdrop.  The acting was very good, as were the fight scenes. Mr Kim has shown many talents in his first movie, as a director, as an actor, and as a martial artist. I will look forward to his next movie.",1148083200,3,514,4.4
2440636,5,B000BTH4LI,I really enjoyed Master Kim's Movie. I appreciate his philosophy portrayed in the movie. The colligraphy in the movie was a great touch.,1147910400,3,136,4.956521739130435

I THIINK HE COULD BE ANOTHER BILLY JACK.",1147824000,,307,3.903225806451613
2440638,5,B000BTH4LI,"This beautifully filmed original movie is Master Kim's feature film debut. I have dozens of Instructional Martial Arts videos, books, and calligraphy from Turtle Press in my collection, and they are the best. Zen Man was welcome. The Martial Arts and acting are very good. I would recommend this dvd to all audiences.",1147824000,4,317,5.0
2440639,4,B000BTH4LI,"Master Kim's first movie was not bad at all.  I thought it was very good for a PG13 rating.  Of course, it would have been much better had it been rated R.

I am very proud of this movie that Master Kim made and I would recommend it in a heart beat to any fellow Martial Warrior or anyone interested in the Martial Ways.  If Bruce Lee were still alive, I believe he would not only congratulate Master Kim but also request for him to be in an upcoming movie with him.

Take care all and God Bless.",1147651200,2,496,4.020408163265306

2440641,5,B000BTH4LI,This production shows beautiful scenery. Actors take a different form of a typical karate movie and bring actual asian philosophies to american families. My 11 year old daughter loved it as all children have dreams which they feel have meaning in life. She found that she could totally relate to the clown scene. This production was a very exciting and deep movie. The fighting scenes were tolerable violence for children. Keep up the good work...and I can't wait to see the movies to come.,1147392000,5,490,4.845238095238095
2440642,5,B000BTH4LI,"Sang Kim has made his transition from documentary/instructional videos to full length feature film. He has not sacrificed his principles as a true martial artist for all the hype of ""Hollyweird"" (Hollywood). This film is genius and is a tribute to Kim's character. The acting and action is awesome, story line is moving and the scenery and music is poetic. With a world plaqued in violent times, many of us can benefit from the underlying messages Sang Kim teaches us in the movie. Finally, a martial arts action film geared towards a broad audience with traditional teachings that everyone will enjoy. Keep up the great work, looking forward to more from Director/ Actor Sang Kim.",1147392000,4,681,4.930434782608696

8092291,2,B000BTH4LI,"Sang H. Kim appears to be the real deal when it comes to teaching the martial arts, but his passion project here demonstrates that he is not cut out to be a filmmaker. This is clearly a niche movie for a niche audience, but in the world of alternative filmmaking, I find myself more attracted to Scott Shaw's disastrous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/zen-films/dp/B009W7XXQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">zen films</a>&nbsp;than to the weirdness of ""Zen Man."" Ambitious beyond its means and boring to a fault, this is the kind of feature that turns viewers off from independent cinema and even tests B-movie fans like me to see it through to the end.

The story: A former martial arts instructor (Kim) becomes embroiled in a revenge scheme involving a drug lord (Richard Dvorak) and the son of a slain student (Grady Justice,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Opponent/dp/B006UKX65K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Opponent</a>).

Director/writer/producer/photographer/choreographer/star Kim is the best thing the film has going for it, however meager of an asset that is. There are flashes of ingenuity in all of the jobs he performs, and while an initial viewing may present the film as a jumbled mess, reflection and a second viewing reveal that a lot of his odd choices - especially in the screenplay - actually make sense. With that said, the film as a whole remains a jumbled mess in the worst way. The editing is amateurish, the camerawork is shaky, the acting can be very poor, the pacing meanders, and the screenplay is filled with unnatural dialogue and halfhearted relationships. A scene wherein Kim is somehow able to outrun a jeep on his bicycle and a couple of amazingly complacent executions push the boundaries of absurdity, but I had a hard time caring because of how uninvolving this feature is. I felt no attachment at all to any of the characters and little interest in the plot.

The picture gets a little better in its final 15 minutes, wherein the bulk of the action content is contained. Not unlike other Korean-American masters who have made movies, Sang Kim carries himself with striking poise even when he's not fighting, but when he does do battle, he casts no doubt over his legitimate credentials. However, Kim favors a relatively realistic approach to his fight scenes that limits most brawls to only a few seconds. A couple weapon-filled randoris act as highlights, but in general, the martial arts are not very fulfilling. I understand that they are not supposed to be the centerpiece of the film, but for a movie that needs literally every asset it can get, this is a disappointing exhibition.

I can't recommend this one. There are plenty of better low-budget karate flicks around. Some of them even care about their stories as much as this one apparently does, but handle them with infinitely greater skill. Keep looking!",1437696000,,2946,5.315450643776824

8092293,2,B000BTH4LI,"I wanted to like it, I really did but I couldn't. It's got alot going for it actually, it really does. To bad that a logical plotline,heck any plotline; a total lack of acting ability by the actor's involved and TV level fight scenes(TV circa 1960's-1970's) That doesn't leave much to work with. All of that being said I think the director has put out some truly amazing MA training DVD's and books but this movie is sorely lacking. Watch it for free or as a 1.50 rental don't spend real money on it like I did.",1408406400,,511,4.278350515463917

I didn't pay for the movie and I still think I should get money for the time I wasted even trying to watch it. Talk about bad acting, loose plot, and not even close to believable action sequences. I thought it was impossible to think a movie could suck so badly on so many levels. Was watching with a friend, she wanted to defriend me for even suggesting the movie!

if you ask me, I believe the producer or a few of the actors got on imdb and rated the movie. No sane person would rate this movie above a minus zero.",1405209600,,615,4.040983606557377
