4370801,1,B004FPE42G,"Very disappointing selection of songs and music.  Volume one is far superior in every way.  Haven't seen volume three yet but hopefully it will make amends.

Can be purchased and imported from rte.ie (Irish national broadcaster).  Don't do it!",1293494400,,243,5.153846153846154
4370802,5,B004FPE42G,This is a great DVD of players from the 1960's to the 1980's of traditional Irish music. I have both volumes.,1287532800,,109,4.238095238095238

8428156,4,B004FPE42G,"This is wonderful Irish Music, played in local towns and villages.  I stumbled on this. Volume I should be around somewhere.",1392336000,,124,4.904761904761905
8428157,3,B004FPE42G,"I had seen some of this collection on Youtube and I suppose that that should have been fair warning. There are four volumes to this collection of archive footage from RTE programs over several decades and it would seem that they just threw them together without  any sort of attempt to  categorize or edit. Without exception introductions by the ""presenters"" are so bad they should have been left off. I would say that about a third of the tracks should have been also. Still there is lots of good stuff if you do not mind wading through the bad.",1389571200,,546,4.505050505050505
8428158,3,B004FPE42G,"Seems like they took material from the cutting room floor to compile this second DVD.  I was really pretty disappointed.  There's a few good tracks, but not compared to the first one.  Perhaps the first one raised my hopes up too high?",1389139200,,235,4.5476190476190474
8428159,4,B004FPE42G,"Excellent as were all my purchases, An education in Traditional Irish Music. As good as the original
  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year",1354579200,,139,4.75
8428160,3,B004FPE42G,"This was not as good as I had hoped it would be. It is worth watching as there is much history of Irish folk music discussed and alot as to Irish music in America.
The sound quality is not as good as I would like, and it consistes of alot of short scenes in Irish pubs and some folks homes, this is how most Irish music was listened to in years past. It does not have the flare or sound quality of a big production, but has good educational value, and also features some of the best musicians to ever play Irish music. It is more like a documentary, than a show.

8428161,3,B004FPE42G,Volume 2 of Come West Along The Road has some great music and a good addition to the first but Volume 1 is better,1301961600,2,113,3.75
8428162,5,B004FPE42G,"Mr. Broderick says he doesn't like Volume 2, but how can he know when it won't be released for two months? I called the producer and they say they don't even have check discs yet. What's with this guy?",1293494400,8,201,4.17948717948718
