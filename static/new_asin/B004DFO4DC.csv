8425306,2,B004DFO4DC,"Based on the artist's description, I expected to see extended time lapse takes. Instead this work is a mixture of disappointingly brief time lapse takes intercut with time consuming pan & zoom takes of still photographs that end up getting the majority of the screen time. This photographer has a good eye. The camera placement & compositions in the frame for the time lapse observations are wonderful, but in every case just as their wonder begins to thrill, the observation is cut short. I wd have liked to see only time lapse observations with longer durations & no still photos.",1304035200,,582,4.83
