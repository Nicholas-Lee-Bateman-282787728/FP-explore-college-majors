735804,3,6303949436,"I thought, out of fairness, at least one person of the male gender should review this blatant `chick' flick.  This movie was obviously slanted toward the female gender, but I have to admit that I did actually enjoyed this  film, at least, most of it.  Why?  To tell you the truth, I'm not really  sure.  Keanu Reeves is certainly on my list of least favorite actors (I use  the word `actor' with great reservation here), and the ending of this film  was so overblown and melodramatic that I sat shaking my head in  embarrassment.
Maybe I ended up liking it because of its nastalgia and  innocense.  I could readily see this as a 1940's Jimmy Stewart vehicle  (Lord knows, it would have been better, but Reeves work here wasn't too  bad).  The setting is Napa Valley in 1945, and the boys are coming home  after the war.  This is a boy meets girl film, and most of it works pretty  well.  However, the butterfly scene in the vineyards is just one of many  outrageous contrivances (along with the grape stamping scene).  Even though  I had to grit my teeth a few times, I came away with a nice, warm, fuzzy  feeling...so I guess that says something.  Between 1 and 10, ""A Walk in the  Clouds"" gets a 6 from me.  If the ending wasn't so stupidly melodramatic, I  would have added another star.  I've certainly seen worse `chick' flicks --  see ""A Thousand Acres"" as an example;-(.",930182400,2,1377,4.465587044534413

My husband & I have put in a patio with brick walk ways and flowering plants, trees,  orange, lemon, mango trees, and water garden etc. We eat out under the  orange tree and call it  ""A Walk in the Clouds""  I think of this  tender movie so often when we are in our garden.  It gives me the same  peace the movie did.  Anthony Quinn was perfect.  Rosemary  (second  generation Italian)",928972800,2,438,4.461538461538462
735806,4,6303949436,"This is an excellent movie that families should watch together. You won't have to worry about the language, and Reeves would be an excellent role model for all males today. He is sensitive, caring and has genuine moral  values that we should emulate today. This movie amazed me, because I'd  never heard of it before. A friend loaned us her copy.

Yes, Keanu Reeves is not the best dramatic actor, but they don't give him the tough lines, and the rest of the cast is great, so he really does quite a good job in this movie.  You have to ignore the logic issue of the original premise, but if you can get past that and enjoy it as a movie about love and family, it's great.",1521849600,,422,4.072289156626506

736203,5,6303949436,"Are the outcomes of the events of our lives fixed or are there open ended possibilities? In this 1995 movie, Keanu Reeves' character, Paul Sutton, suffers 3 very similar dreams (nightmares) all three started on a WWII battle field of a Pacific Island but they had different endings. One ending was of a young child taking a flame thrower as if in war. There were crying and death. The second involved the same young child but this time the child was dead or dying with a bleeding heart. Reeves awake from this dream calling for Victoria. The third dream ended with the same child beckoning Reeve's character, Paul, to join him and his mother, Victoria, on a walk in the clouds. A very well done bit of movie making to highlight one of life's most essential lessons. The outcomes of the events of our lives depend in a great part on our decisions.",1511568000,,846,4.5359477124183005

This is one love-story movie for both guys and gals to enjoy.  If you buy the premise, you will buy the rest of the plot. The music, cinematography, visualizations, and casting are outstanding.  If you are a gringo, it can be watched repeatedly for missed subplots and details you might have missed or misunderstood in the Hispanic setting.  I do feel the movie hurried and crammed too much into too short a period of time, but we can always hope for a lengthier directors cut someday.  The incredible soundtrack music kept pace with the screenplay magnificently.  It is one movie that makes one wonder whether a sequel is being considered.",1507507200,,797,5.720338983050848

736417,5,6303949436,"I have viewed this post-WWII-era movie often and it is intertwined with a married soldier, Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves), coming home and helping a young woman, Victoria Aragon (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), with her predicament. She is returning home from her university on a bus just as he is out on the road selling wrapped chocolates for a living while his bride, Betty Sutton (Debra Messing), is practicing to become 'famous' at home. Paul and Victoria travel together after bumping into each other here and there. They strike up a friendship as he finds out she needs his help with her family, especially her extremely strict father. They concoct a story that they believe to be plausible and carry on with that at the ranch named ""The Clouds"" she hails from in Napa Valley, CA where they all grow and harvest grapes for wine at this huge generational vineyard. Victoria is not married and Paul offers to be her stand-in husband as he wishes to help her out as long as he can leave since he is already married on the next day. This is the best idea they can come up with as Paul is quite kind for doing what he is doing for Victoria. And, Victoria is completely beguiling and caring when it comes to Paul. With each attempt to get up and leave after what turns into nights of strict adherence to the rules of a newly married couple only relegates Paul to bumping into the jovial Grandfather of the ranch, Don Pedro Aragon (Anthony Quinn) in his attempts to leave. Pedro loves chocolates, his granddaughter, some lovely wine and singing along with the stronger drink, also, he loves Paul Sutton! Every morning Paul tries to leave the ranch. How is he ever to make it out of there when Pedro is practically circling the ranch until he comes out into the light? Does Paul even wish to leave by now, and, what about his newfound feeling for Victoria? His feelings for the gently growing grapes which are a part of her, tossing his ""new bride"" into the vat to stomp on and crush the grapes of the new harvest complicate his feelings and her's. With broken-hearted timing, Paul finally leaves ""The Clouds"" feeling definitely unloved by Victoria's father but loved by Pedro. He knows how Victoria feels for him now. He cannot return with a wife waiting for him back at home who married him before he left for the war as he closes this chapter on his life.

A gentle and heartwarming love story unfolds soon after, with a straightforward portrayal from Keanu Reeves. There is quite a bit of humor and angst involved, quiet and gentle nobility with plenty of surprises I have left out. Any fan of a good and solid, well thought-out story with plenty of loving family loyalty will like this film along with fans of Keanu Reeves and Anthony Quinn as he 'steals the show' in many different places. The film is full of the lovely Hispanic culture of which is wonderful to learn about right down to the Pumpkin Flower Soup they eat at their first married meal at ""The Clouds"". It is exquisitely and intricately romantic and the late 'Roger Ebert' himself said that he loved everything about this movie: Everything. How could I disagree?

People asked for permission, suitors asked for the daughter's hand in marriage. Respect and Honor and Morals were the norm, back in the day. And this movie might be as strange as walking on the moon for many, but, if you sit back and just absorb the life as it once was, I think everyone would be much happier to live in a time like this. This is a gem of a movie and it is an all star cast of actors depecting an era that has long been gone, but will always live in my heart as I live and breathe. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time, just to relive this type of life again.

This is in my opinion Keanu reeves best movie ever. It has to do w predjudice between whites and Hispanics. It takes place after world war 2.

Him and the lead lady meet on a bus she is pregnant out of wedlock which was a big deal back then and he meets her family. Confusion ensues.

This is a very touching romance and an awesome end. You know it's a great movie when everyone wants a copy at the end. I spent over 10 years on a quest to remember the title of this movie. If I had to I would have been willing to spend an additional 10 years as well.

Features veteran star Anthony Quin as the grandfather. I believe one of his last movies. I believe he passed and with him and Jerry orbach passing the world and Hollywood both lost and closed a door on a particular type of actor both in movies and on broadway.",1489881600,,926,4.016304347826087

736972,3,6303949436,"Beautifully filmed and well-meaning but shamelessly chain-jerking tale; one-dimensional characters.  I loved Keanu Reaves in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lake-House/dp/B002V0GZ9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lake House</a>, one of my favorite romantic movies ever (wooden acting and all), but I just could not get past it and his paper-thin character here.  Clich-ridden and predictable.  I found the dramatic music incongruous and a distraction, too grand for the slight story.  As can be seen by the positive reviews many were moved by this but I was not.

***SPOILER ALERT*** Among other things the family was devout Roman Catholic and the entire premise that they would forsake their values and so easily forgive lying, adultery and formication (to say nothing of having a daughter whom they scarcely kept tabs on supposedly working on a masters degree and living in the city alone in the WWII era, and whom they also planned to marry off to a local man) was absurd.  Ditto with the grape-crushing scene wherein she pulled up her skirt revealing her thighs and appeared  to be in the throes of an orgasm- in front of her father, grandfather, servants, and God, HELLO, modesty?  Giancarlo Gianninis father character was hard-edged and cruel one minute and moved to tears the next, ridiculous.  And how did he come by his torment, since his parents were utterly easygoing, positive and loving?

When WILL I learn not to purchase movies until AFTER viewing?  I write this review to suggest that you rent before buying, to possibly save you the buyers remorse I felt.  I didn't hate this movie but I didn't love it either- for me, the plot-holes and Reeves acting were too much to get past, but I think its worth renting for the gorgeous scenery and cinematography.",1476403200,,1817,5.2926829268292686

737066,4,6303949436,"Even though this movie came out in '95 (I think it was), I still love to watch it. I don't know what it is that grips me. Maybe it's the honesty, or the intense sense of family loyalty. It's a great love story. It is so true to the WWII era; too many marriages made in haste that shouldn't have happened. Yet in this movie, he (Keanu) wants to belong to a family, something he never had. There is one scene when the two main characters eyes lock and you just melt with the heat of love in their eyes. It's a beautiful thing. Eleven years later, I do see some faults with the story line, and overdone characters. If you like love stories, and wine, and Mexican culture and family values, it hits the mark.",1472515200,5,704,4.1838235294117645

Maybe the actor's timing was off.  (Except for Anthony Quinn).  Perhaps there was an editing problem.  Even the voices sound dubbed sometimes.  The scenery was overdone and looked like it was made in a studio.  Too bad, because we can always use a nice movie to make up for all the disgusting ones. Still, I could hardly watch it.

Also my favorite performance by Keanu Reeves.  If you enjoy learning the Spanish language (as I do), get this movie and watch it over and over - first in Spanish audio and English subtitles, then the reverse.  Most of the Spanish audio is slow enough and clear enough to follow (unlike most movies), and the phrases used are common everyday things that will enhance your functional language ability (unlike most movies).  Since most of the film takes place within the Hispanic culture, and it works well.  Giancarlo Giannini is also perfect in this film.",1466812800,3,687,4.73109243697479

737817,3,6303949436,"I live in the area in which ""A Walk in the Clouds"" (AWITC) was filmed, and so I had to watch it, even though I'm pretty much hit and miss on the talents of one Keanu Reeves.  Offhand, the only movie where he starred that I thought he did a great job:  ""Rivers Edge"" (RE).  And I believe that was his first film.  And that movie was about an event that occurred in a city within an hour or so from me, and I've visited that city more than a few times.

But RE was really good, mostly because it was very gritty, and very real.  It was based upon a true story, about a kid in Milipitas, CA I believe, who killed a female classmate of his.  Supposedly, in real life, many other students knew about the murder, but didn't want to ""rat out"" the killer.  It also is the case that RE reminds me of some of the stronger efforts of David Lynch, in particular, ""Blue Velvet.""  I highly recommend it.

Well, in contrast, it's difficult for me to recommend AWITC.  The screenplay is probably not based upon a true story, but even if it is, it is so unrealistic that the story must've been vastly modified.  One of the biggest issues that I have:  I don't know too many wineries in this area that are owned by Mexicans.  Sure, many Mexicans work at the wineries -- watch ""Falcon Crest,"" which is more realistic, and better even as a series -- but not too many Mexicans are owners.  Plus, the movie just plays with your emotions constantly with lame, overused plot devices.  I won't write specifically about those devices, but of course in general, the story constantly puts Mr. Reeves in positions to become a ""sudden hero,"" and to change the minds of the people who wouldn't otherwise like him.  Ugh.

I think that many critics have raved over the cinematography, and I will admit, some of that is pretty good.  However, I drive down a mountain similar to the one in the film all the time -- it's once again in the area -- and my drive is probably more beautiful than the film.  I read Roger Ebert's review, and he was enamored with this film, and not with just the cinematography.  Well, I believe that his review on this film is one that he just plain got wrong.

But is this film worth watching at all?  Well, I believe it's supposed to be a drama, but it really should be listed under the comedy genre.  After all, I was laughing through the whole movie, which made my wife mad a bit.  But even she had to admit that AWITC is probably not really worth a peek.",1459209600,,2451,4.276086956521739

738207,5,6303949436,"This was actually a repurchase.  I had watched the movie several years ago, loved it, but somehow it became lost in my DVD library.  I usually purchase digital movies, but this time I wanted the case in my hand so I felt like I really OWNED the movie and I knew I could put it up for safekeeping and not lose it again.  This isn't one of Keanu Reeve's better known movies and is a departure from a lot of the action movies he is more known for.  This is a sweet love story about a soldier returning home from WW2 to the wife he met and married the weekend before shipping out.  You know things are not going to be great in their relationship when she doesn't even show up to meet his ship when he arrives back to the US.  Keanu plays a very likeable and sweet man whose main focus seems to be pleasing everyone else and insuring their happiness even at the expense of his own.  He has a chance encounter with a troubled young woman who is returning home with a secret she is afraid to tell her very traditional and somewhat intimidating family.  They have several chance encounters before they find themselves alone on a road together.  He has been kicked off of a bus after defending her honor against some other men on the bus.  Walking to the next town he finds her sitting at the side of the road, crying, and offers to do what he can to help her.  Even though every time he has helped her throughout the course of the morning it has not turned out well for him!  She explains the predicament she has found herself in.  Being the kind gentleman who always wants to help, he comes up with a plan to help her face her family and spare her the shame and anger she is afraid she will be met with upon returning home.  During the course of a beautiful story the two find out that they were made for each other, and our hero finds the family he has always longed for.  His welcome into the family wasn't a very friendly one, but he once again sacrifices for others, but this time for himself as well.  He temporarily returns home to find his wife has already moved on - he's thrilled - and he can go back to the life he feels he was meant for and to the family who now accepts him with open arms.  The cinematography is absolutely beautiful.  The movie is well made, contains an original story, and for people who love a good love story - or Keanu Reeves - this movies is a must.",1451865600,2,2377,4.186813186813187

When their the families prized and most beloved daughter arrives home pregnant and from university without a the husband accompanying her at her side the drama begins. The Father, almost like a Muslim  feels that his daughter has dishonored him.  Thank God he does not stone her in the film for her getting pregnant before she is married. Thankfully the tension is reduce by the rest of the family who is very loving and accepting of the situation and the young man she has brought home as a ploy to play her husband having met him on the bus in a plot worthy of Shakespearean drama.  - JCANGELCRAFT",1431129600,,919,4.4523809523809526

Keanu Reeves is ""mediocre"" at best, but young and still good to look at - the young woman playing his love interest is VERY good, and most believable.  Anthony Quinn was his spectacular self - bigger than life, and full of it - life that is - even though he must have been close to or in his 80's when this film was made.  I'm a sucker for happy endings, and after much strife and trauma, this does end on a hopeful note.  I'd say, ""watch it"" you will feel uplifted if you do.",1430438400,,643,4.316666666666666

A soldier in World War II, Keanu Reeves, returns from the Pacific to discover the girl he married hastily before going overseas, is not as passionate about their marriage as he imagined when he wrote her all those letters from overseas hoping for a future together.  She hasn't even read them.  On his way to again sell chocolots as before the war he defends a girl being harrassed on the bus, and this leads to his getting involved with a tradtional, Mexican family, wine growers for many years. She is pregnant from a college professor who has abandoned her, and Keanu agrees to act as her husband so as not to disgrace her with her family - especially a passionate, demanding father.  We are drawn into the life of this family, beautiful, compassionate people and it's wonderful to get involved in their lives.  Anthony Quinn (himself actually Mexican in birth, although he played many roles of different nationalities, is brilliant as the father of the girl's disapproving father.

Review - 2/5
I don't often watch romantic films. I'm more of a horror or action film type of guy. I'm usually forced only by the girlfriend or because I enjoy a good Keanue Reeves film once in awhile. The movie is beautiful to look at, but by the end I was so sick of hearing about vineyards. I could care less about Mexican tradition or vineyards when I'm trying to watch a romantic film. Unfortunately so much is dedicated to it, it loses sight of what the film is about. I felt like it was thrown in to add to the runtime. The relationship between the two leads wasn't strong enough. I didn't really feel any kind of natural spark. Any romance that does happen is beyond corny and laughable. I would much rather rewatch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notebook/dp/B000YMFCS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notebook</a>, or even be forced to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Vow/dp/B005LAIGSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Vow</a>&nbsp;again.

740118,4,6303949436,"For the longest time, I mocked my wife for loving this movie.  I actively hate all things Keanu Reeves, and so the fact that he actually starred in this film soured me before I ever saw it.  Despite actually liking it, I still continued to mock her and the film and actually formed an opinion of distaste despite the fact that I kind of enjoyed every moment of it when it was on.  I was mean, I know this, and sulking on the couch, actively hiding my enjoyment to make a point (let ME pick the movie next time) was childish and dumb.

I don't fight it anymore.

The thing is that for once in his life Reeves loosened up a bit, and while his performance is not really good, it doesnt take away from everything else that is so beautiful about this movie.  The simple plot is nicely woven, the supporting cast (Giannini, Quinn!) add such delight and emotional weight to the film, and the scenery (and music) is splendid.  So, when my wife gets all nostalgic and wants to revisit this childhood favorite of hers, I give in with little protest.

740119,5,6303949436,"I've enjoyed a number of Keanu Reeves' movies, from ""Bill and Ted"" and ""The Matrix"" to the more recent ""Constantine."" ""A Walk in the Clouds"" is one of his forays into the romance genre, and it's a favorite of mine in that category. The story begins during the waning days of WWII, where Army veteran Paul (Reeves) arrives in San Francisco after four years of combat. He makes his way home and surprises a wife he barely knows. After an awkward reunion, she practically shoves him out the door the next day with an admonition to start raking in the bucks by selling chocolates. The life of a traveling salesman is not what he had in mind, but he decides to make a go of it for her sake.",1391731200,,685,4.317829457364341

740344,5,6303949436,"The review from the Amazon.com reviewer is way off base. Roger Ebert said, ""I love everything about this movie."" and I want to trust the late Mr. Ebert than the reviewer here. Keanu Reeves is wonderful as the moral and upstanding Paul Sutton who steps in to protect a young lady from her father's wrath when the girl admits she is returning home pregnant from college, deserted by her professor who is the baby's father. You have to have an understanding of post-war America in the 1940's when this situation was dire for a woman and where a woman having a baby out of wedlock was shunned. This is where the moral compass of Reeves' character settles, on pretending to be her husband for a night and then leaving her a note in the morning to say he has abandoned her. In those days, yes, it would be terrible, but not as bad as telling you are pregnant and the boyfriend won't marry you.
Reeves is handsome and persuasive, realizing he is falling in love with his pretend wife, and knowing he has to return to the wife he knew for three days before being sent off to war for four years. His character make all the right moral decisions and such a plot device is hard to find in movies of this generation.

740345,5,6303949436,Kneau Reeves is captivating. He gives a grand performance in this movie. A keeper for any movie buff. Realistic for the times,1377561600,,125,4.7272727272727275
740346,2,6303949436,"If you have seen the post-WWII classic, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", you have seen half the plot line of this film. The other parts of this film's plot come from ""My Big, Fat Greek Wedding"", ""West Side Story"", and ""Look Who's Talking"".

Seriously, the lack of original plot ideas in this film is laughable. The other part that's laughable is the phony scenery created either by CGI, models, or both. Obviously they used a lot of CGI and models because it's so difficult to find pretty scenery in Napa Valley, California.(sarcasm) The painted scenery is almost cartoonish.

And, if you like yellow light in your shots, this is the film for you! I think the sky is blue in only two shots - the rest of the time it's always sunrise or sunset. Be sure to watch for one of the last scenes when two people are kissing and the director even manages to get a shot of yellow light shining through their mouths.

3/4ths of the way through I said, ""This movie is a piece of crap"", but by then I was already invested so I had to see if the predictable end came true. It did.

Don't waste your time or money on this silly thing! If you want to see a supremely great, moving, inspiring piece of art about the same era just rent ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" directed by William Wyler. You'll be much happier and will learn what great filmmaking is all about too.",1377043200,,1350,4.324110671936759

740349,5,6303949436,"As this movie approaches its 20th year, I've seen it a number of times. I enjoy just as much every time.

Reeves plays a young soldier (Paul Sutton) returning from tough combat duty in the Pacific Theater of WWII. He returns to a ""Last minute bride"" whom he met only briefly before he shipped out, and it is no surprise that they have trouble connecting on his return. When he starts travelling for his job of selling chocolates, he meets and befriends a young woman ""in trouble"" ... as it was called in those days. She is pregnant out of wedlock, and he offers to ease the transition for her very conservative family and very judgmental father by posing as her husband until she can get a handle on her problems.

As others have mentioned, the scenery is rustic and beautiful, and the young lady's family, owners of a vineyard, ring true with a variety of personalities and emotional reactions. Of course, things get a little complicated when Paul actually falls in love with Victoria, and the process of winning over her father is understandably difficult.

Anthony Quinn, in one of his later roles, plays the kind and wise grandfather to perfection, and other members of the family disappear into their roles to give you a true sense of family and a generational family enterprise. Scenes of the nuts and bolts of what happens on a vineyard just add to the movie's charm and authentic atmosphere.

Reeves gives his oft used performance of a steady, caring, solid young man who cares about those he encounters and is ready to do whatever he can to help.

Some call this a chick flick, but I'm not sure what guy wouldn't want to be in Paul's shoes: the rescue and love of a fair maiden (OK, not really a maiden in the definitive sense lol), the adventure of a new undertaking, the challenge of winning over people ... all are engaging and interesting elements that give this story so much depth and vigor.

I have a different take on Keanu's performance. I believe his 'wooden' acting, as has been described in more than a few reviews here, is a plus in portraying a strong but lonely man who grew up in an orphanage and wrote hundreds of unread letters to a wife he was hoping to share his feelings with, despite not getting many in return. He might have not learned the ways to be as outwardly emotional as his new found family but he did know how to love, recognize love and say yes when the situation was right.",1354320000,,781,4.342465753424658

Very grating on the nerves. It's a sweet story and pretty well told. One glaring error that just stopped me dead in my tracks and ruined it for me.  If it's cold enough out there to ruin the grapes then why on earth is she running around, up and down the rows of grapes, in her nightgown. It was just so obviously a deliberate ploy to show her as beautiful and ethereal that it was simply ridiculous. Don't directors ever ""think"" about what they are doing. Keanu Reeves is wooden as usual but for some reason it seemed to fit the part as it was written. Hell, maybe they wrote it for him so wrote it as ""wooden"". It's just a 40's movie and not as well done as 40's movies were.",1348876800,,839,4.172839506172839

There's a scene in the beginning on the Bus how the heroine vomits on Keanu Reeves when they meet for the first time. Now it so happened when I was in 8 Th or so in St. Thomas School in 1992-93 and returning home by School Bus a boy named Parevez Khan from my younger brother's class came near me in the crowded bus looking pretty sick.

The hero and heroine are on a bus, two oafish louts sit down by the heroine and start forcing their attentions on her--guess what happens next.

He agrees to pose as her husband to save her from being killed (evidently) by her tradition-bound father. One day only then he'll leave--but guess what happens next.

Hero could marry the heroine, whom he's fallen in love with, if only he were not married himself.  He stoically returns home to his ditzy wife only to find that--guess what happens next.

The cold, unresponsive father gets told off by the hero for not being loving enough towards his daughter in cliche lines from the 90s (wasn't this supposed to be in the 40s?) and at the end of the movie, guess what happens?

Guess who saves the whole family business in the end?

You get the idea.

I got this movie for two reasons: Anthony Quinn and Giancarlo Giannini, two consumate actors.  Unfortunately Gianinnini's lines are so horrible even he can't make them work.  The only redeeming aspect of the movie is Quinn's performance.

740992,4,6303949436,"`A Walk in the Clouds' is a gentle, touching film that makes for perfect Sunday afternoon viewing.

When a US soldier (Paul ) returns home after the second world war he comes across a pregnant lady in distress (Victoria) and pretends to be her husband to save her family from dishonour. He accompanies her back to her families vineyard in the Napa Valley, California and struggles to win over her father, whilst learning about family commitment and the ways of the vineyard.

The settings of this film are stunning and the valley vineyards and redwood forests make for a beautiful backdrop to this heart-warming story.  Keanu Reeves, as we have sadly come to expect, acts terribly; the wood in the vines around him have more life and nuance.  But it goes some way to show how good this film is that it retains its charm regardless of the poor performance from the leading actor.  Anthony Quinn is wonderful and full of life as the family patriarch and Victoria's grandfather.

This film doesn't have, and doesn't need, any big effects or gimmicks to sell it the audience.  It is old fashioned film making at it's best where the story itself is enough to win you over and keep you watching.  This film has it's flaws, but they aren't insurmountable and generally it makes for a pleasant, heart warming 90 minutes viewing.

 I sure felt his pain throughout the film as he portrayed the emotion quite well. He also did a wonderful job of displaying grace under fire and Love through the flame of directed hate and anger towards him.

This is a wonderful movie and being a guy I had to ask myself what would I do in his position? Pretty much what he did sadly even though I wanted the best for him and Aitana Snchez-Gijn who just blew my socks off. This actress knows how to use a look in the most subtle way saying volumes without a whisper.

If you are a guy and watch this and if you have not shed a tear of joy by the end of the movie then your heart is stone cold. ( NO I'm not fricken gay) The core of the movie is about Love, Love of Family, honor and dropping the macho crap and learning to love.

There's nothing bad about this movie. It has everythting good in it.  I liked it across the board. I'll watch it again and again.

It was wonderfull to see Anthony Quinn in this film as he used his age to the characters benefit. The old mans wisdom was as heart warming as can be. I don't think anyone else other than Anthony Quinn could have pulled this off near as well. You simply wish you had him in your family too.",1296950400,3,1355,3.9962962962962965

One note to the ""Official"" Amazon reviewer: It's very well demonstrated (both visually and audibly) that the reason the family and farm hands are using the silk-like wings in the vineyard is to try to distribute the heat from the fires burning in the cans down to the grape vines (not to chase away insects, as you wrote).

And it's never dropped the ball as an effective date flick.

It's set during the World War II era, so right away you're planted in a place and a time in flux, when sentiment was embraced fully, when life was lived at its fullest, and desperate love stories resonated like mad. After his stint in the military, young war veteran Paul Sutton (Reeves) readjusts to civilian life. Occasionally suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Paul says goodbye to a wife he's hardly seen and sets off on his humble new job as a traveling salesman of chocolate bon bons. Journeying from Frisco to Sacramento, Paul meets Victoria Aragon, a distressed beautiful girl on her way home from college, and finally the story gets going.

Paul Sutton is one of those guys you can count on. He learns that Victoria is in trouble. She is expecting, but has been abandoned by the baby's father, some weasel of a guy. And, now on her way home, she is ashamed and dreads her proud father's displeasure. Now here's the key premise: To save her honor, Paul offers to temporarily pose as Victoria's husband, and she accepts. And, just to emphasize that this is a fable as much as a sumptuous love story, Victoria and Paul are soon gazing down into an idyllic valley kissed lovingly by the sun and with just that hint of mist at the edges (a soul-filling vision you don't much get in real life). Victoria's wealthy family owns and runs a vineyard in Napa, and this valley seems so bountiful and blessed that I have no doubt grapes willingly go there to die.

The movie hearkens to those old-time cinematic love stories, and if you buy into it, then you'll have a blast gnashing your teeth as obstacles surface for the star-crossed lovers only for those obstacles to be knocked down, and then only to have further obstacles pop up. The main thorn is Victoria's blustery, suffocating father Alberto Aragon (a very good Giancarlo Giannini). Alberto is highly offended that a) his daughter shows up married without warning and b) that she married a gringo, and a gringo whose vocation is selling candy. Another pretty big deterrent is that Paul is still married, so, really, how far can things go with Victoria? Female viewers have sighed at this unbearable impasse (I know, I've already had to watch this flick a bunch of times with chicks). I did say this was an effective date movie, didn't I?

You soak in the story's earthiness and sensuality, and while this isn't quite in the realm of magical realism, there's an echo of that going on. Director Alfonso Arau, who earlier had made the wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Like-Water-for-Chocolate/dp/6305428476/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Like Water for Chocolate</a>, urges you to lose yourself in the doings onscreen, the images are this evocative. Alfonso Arau even takes an old cornball scene and makes it one of the film's best moments. It's when that old romantic soul, Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn, terrific), coaxes Paul into serenading Victoria underneath her window as she lay sleeping. Paul is drunk but willing and this leads to one of the many grace notes of the film - grace notes, providing that you allow yourself to let go. There's also the grape stomping ritual, which, as performed by Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, somehow turns out a lot sexier than when Lucille Ball did it. But, okay, the scene where everyone heats up the frost-bitten grapes with butterfly wings? That might've been too much.

I'm sort of torn between admiring Keanu's simplicity of acting and making fun of his robot-like line delivery. To label Reeves' performance as one-dimensional is to spot him one dimension too many. I get the feeling that, to Keanu, being nuanced means that he should hold off on saying ""whoa"" in a movie. On the other hand, there's a certain level of comfort with that same simplicity of acting. In keeping with its place and period, there's no room for clever cynicism or pop culture snark. That would destroy the old-fashioned romantic mood the film is trying to invoke. A love story like this resorts to old school sensibilities, and that includes requiring the leading man to be a stand-up guy, to be, to use a couple of outdated words, ""gallant"" and ""honorable."" Reeves solidly demonstrates these attributes. Plus, he and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon sizzle in their scenes together.

Discounting Keanu, the story is marked with several outstanding performances. Giancarlo Giannini is pretty great as the acerbic, domineering Alberto Aragon, Victoria's dad. Old-timer Anthony Quinn steals every scene with his wise and generous-hearted patriarch, Don Pedro Aragon. But, since I'm a guy, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, in a rare venture into American pictures, ends up making the most impact. The girl is luminous, and it's a bad blow that she hasn't done much in American cinema before and since. She certainly made a fan out of me. More than anything else, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon is the reason I buy into this sappy movie.",1256601600,,6041,5.367088607594937

The train lurches suddenly and the two fall to the floor (in the missionary position!); she stands up and vomits on his uniform (cue to the audience: she's either got motion-sickness or she's pregnant...my guess would be the latter). He volunteers to temporarily pose as her husband once she returns to her hot-tempered Italian brood nestled deep in the valley on a Northern California vineyard estate (""It's called 'The Clouds'!""); naturally, leaving the forlorn beauty the next night proves to be difficult for the young soldier.

Before the war, he was a chocolate salesman, but he is dissatisfied with civilian life and suffers from PTSD. Aboard a train, he meets Victoria (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n), a beautiful woman traveling alone. She was pursuing her master's degree in literature, but became pregnant. Victoria has nowhere to go but home to her domineering father Alberto and his winery, and Paul offers to be her ""husband"" to make her pregnancy appear legitimate to her family. Once at the vineyard, Paul is convinced by Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn, apparently reprising his role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zorba-the-Greek/dp/B0001XALGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zorba the Greek</a>) to stay and help with the yearly harvest. Paul gradually becomes accepted by Victoria's very traditional Mexican family, and pitches in to help with the backbreaking labor involved in maintaining the vineyard.

Perhaps the greatest tragedy is the waste of what could have been: the romance is strictly by-the-numbers, and Keanu's painfully wooden delivery (he redefines the word ""monotone"") does little to soften already formulaic dialogue.

I watch this movie a few times every year.  The scenery is beautiful but so is the story.  What orphan wouldn't want to be part of this wine-producing family?  The grandfather is the star of the movie in my opinion.  The female lead is luminous.

If you want to know the definition of chivalry, watch and learn.

Just got the Blu-ray version and watched that.  It was definitely worth the upgrade for that Napa scenery alone.

741517,5,6303949436,"After working as an actor in such films as Sam Peckinpah's controversial Western ""The Wild Bunch,"" and starred in Alejandro Jodorowsky's legendary cult film ""El Topo,"" Alfonso Arau makes his directorial debut in a magical Mexican art film, 'Like Water for Chocolate,' set during the Mexican Revolution...

His success makes him direct his first English-language feature, where he presents the strength and beauty of the bonds that can unite human hearts...

The time was right after World War II...

The place was more lovely than you ever imagined... Gorgeous scenery dominated by vineyards, the perfect nestle for a romantic fairy tale...

Everything comes from the heart in this rich heartwarming film... Arau's vision and dream was to build a tunnel between what we know and don't know about two-spirited people, the roots and blood-ties of a family, its traditional values, and its attachment to the earth...

Arau reinforces the borders of tradition in the Mexican aristocratic family who have lived on American soil for generations, describing her fundamental values: family solidarity, religious commitment, and cooperation with the land and nature... His motion picture derives its emotional power not only from the sweet love that blossoms between Paul and Victoria, but from the unconditional familial love that the young GI encounters while at her hacienda... Each type of love is strengthened through the knowledge that one leads to the other...

Keanu Reeves plays the quiet expressive dreamer who finds the traditional values in a magical place... He is a genteel seller of chocolate candy who, en route on a train from San Francisco to Sacramento, meets a graduate student in crisis... He learns that she is frightened to return home because she is pregnant and unmarried...

To protect Victoria from her father's wrath, and ignoring obviously the outcome, Paul tells Victoria that he believes ""there's a perfect someone for everyone - someone who'll love you no matter what."" He gallantly insists in posing as her husband just for one night...

Making her American film debut, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays the strong, exquisite woman 'so easy to love'... Victoria has been seduced and abandoned by a 'free spirit.' She is now on her way to her wine-growing family in Napa Valley to help with the annual grape harvest...

While her silken butterfly big wings spread the heated air around the frozen grapes, Victoria's sight was enough to engulf Paul with desire... And when her dark hair tumbled down to him, Paul's face was burnt by the harshness of actually having been able to feel some part of her... This burning has been caused by something as soft and luscious as her beautiful black hair... It is simply Arau's shot of her luminous figure, that discreetly heightened her feminine mystique, and her strong sensuality...

The legendary Anthony Quinn, a two-time Academy Award-winner for ""Viva Zapata"" and ""Lust for Life,"" is the wise patriarch, Don Pedro who tries to intensify the romance between Paul Sutton and Victoria, while her father tries his best to show his displeasure at her choice... While chomping Paul's chocolates, the sagacious old man shows the polite soldier the root from which the entire vineyard has grown, and instructs him the traditions and beliefs of his ultra-conservative family...

Screen veteran Giancarlo Giannini (who received an Oscar nomination for his performance in ""Seven Beauties""), plays the proud, suspicious, ultra-traditional father, whose beliefs are deeply rooted in tradition: 'My daughter can trace her roots back 400 years to the best families in Mexico,' he affirms... As a strong believer in the importance of family, Don Alberto Arag&oacute;n reacts violently to the prospect of his beloved daughter already married to someone who has nothing... No family. No past. No future!

If you want to be moved by a consummate screen composer, and enjoy a wonderful family dinner... If you want to watch Reeves and Quinn singing and getting drunk... If you want to observe joyous women rolling around in a tub of emerald green grapes, keeping pace with the help of musicians... If you want to admire sensational landscapes sleeping against the sunset sky, or forming like a dream out of the silver dawn... don't miss this breathtaking piece of visual art, and step into the magic!",1168905600,2,4341,5.159317211948791

A Walk In The Clouds is a beautiful film that harkens back to the Golden Age of movies.  The cinematography is stunning, the visual effects (especially those of the vineyards) are gorgeous and the script is simple, precise and elegant.  It's fashionable these days to slam Keanu Reeves. But if you'd like to see another example of spares, controlled acting that conveys a remarkably strong screen presence you need look no further than Gregory Peck.

Reeves is perfect in the role of the war weary soldier, returning from war, who is unsure about his place in the world as he tries to reaclimate to society.

741599,4,6303949436,"Just viewed this movie for the third or fourth time since seeing it at the show ten years ago, and still find it an amazing film, for light entertainment-slash-sentimental love story. (Note to all would-be movie reviewers: Learn how to review a movie for what it is, on its own terms, and not for what it is not.) Its a period piece, with stunningly gorgeous cinematography and locales, and a pretty good turn at story-telling, craftsmanship and acting - yes - even on Keanu Reeves' part. (There seems to be a trend amongst male movie reviewers to give `de facto bad reviews' to such actors as Brad Pitt and Keanu Reeves, 'just because'. Its a sad testament to the frailty of the male ego that some of us feel threatened, challenged, and even competitive with a guy we probably don't even know, and will most likely never meet.) Anyway, I don't really know what movie the Amazon reviewer saw, because, frankly, he was blatantly wrong on all the salient points about this film.

 First off, its a good movie, for its genre and the story it tells. Next, Keanu Reeves is completely plausible, and likable in his role as a war Veteran who saw, and endured many terrible things during his time of service, attempted to forget it all, then tried to come back to a normal life with a wife he married on a spur of the moment, as many soldiers do, hoping to make it work. (There was even a pivotal scene between Keanu and Giancarlo Giannini, where he explains why and how he had to `close himself off' emotionally, to do what he had to do to survive the horrors of war, hence, his stoicism, which the Amazon reviewer somewhat shallowly dismisses as `wooden'.) He shows real emotion when he needs to - and where it is required - mainly, in his scenes with Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, for whom he has real affection, and not Debra Messing, his `impulse' bride. Which would explain (to those who were paying attention) why he really didn't care that she was `cheating on him' with Armistead. Or, for that matter, the vineyard fire at the end, which, to him, must have been much like the scorched battlefields he experienced during the war. (What type of war hero runs and screams with everyone else when such an event occurs?) What the Amazon reviewer calls `wooden', others would label `grace under fire' (no pun intended), or just keeping a level head.

 Guess what, reviewer: The farmhands were not chasing insects with their `gossamer wings', but actually try to divert heat onto the vines during a night of killing frost. To this viewer, Keanu Reeves didn't seem `terribly self-conscious', but more like a man who was genuinely and hopelessly in love with someone he barely knew, and trying desperately to impress that upon both her, and her unrelentingly suspicious and un-welcoming father.

 In his defense, the Amazon reviewer was actually talking about the `VHS Tape edition', so, its possible he may have seen a completely different movie all together, one other than what most of the viewers here saw. But this reviewer, for one, loved this movie, the ensemble of actors, the locales, the soundtrack, and the quiet, easy way it creeps into the sentimental heart of most people who see it - even us guys. Except, of course, for those who had their heads in the clouds, while it was playing.",1127001600,34,3282,4.679376083188908

741601,5,6303949436,"I too feel this is a very sweet story about a young soldier who upon his return home from the war, runs into a young lady in trouble and takes time out of his life and his need to pursue his own new job to help her.  This is the kind of refreshing morality and chivalry that was not so terribly uncommon back in the '40s if you can believe other films that were produced during that era.  This young man falls in love with this woman who has been abandoned and who is afraid to go home and face a very strict, unforgiving father.  He wants to help her so they decide she will introduce him as her husband to her family, he will then spend one night with her and then he will ""abandon"" her.  But of course circumstances occur that cause the stay to go on for a longer period of time and then they are lost in each other.  He however is in a loveless marriage that was jumped into during the war and must be resolved in someway in order to proceed either with the marriage or with the new relationship.  His wife is not really interested in him so he is not sure if she will want to try to make a marriage with him or not.

There is nothing earth shaking about this film --- it is just very pleasant to view.  It is a very moral and unselfish love story and I agree with one of the other reviewers that it would be a great movie to watch with a boyfriend and/or girlfriend.  You can't go wrong with this one.

741602,5,6303949436,"Paul Sutton, played by Keanu Reeves, is a WWII veteran and traveling salesman who meets a Mexican graduate student on her way home to her family in the Mexican vineyards.  She is devastated because she is pregnant and the father of her child, her professor, abandons her.  To save her from being disgraced by her traditional father, they concoct a plan by pretending to be married so she wouldn't have a baby out of wedlock.  Sutton meets Victoria's family and right there, knows that this is what he is looking for.  He is an orphan, a man with no roots.  The movie's theme centers around family and tradition; something that Sutton is looking for.  The feelings between Victoria and Paul are deep, despite what they are doing is wrong.

The scenery makes for a romantic backdrop.  The vivid colors bring forth the passion and intensity of the family and for the couple.  Anthony Quinn, may he rest in peace, is excellent in his roll and the patriarch of the Aragon family.  He shows how connected he is to his Mexican heritage expressing the passion of his country and family.

741653,5,6303949436,"I've enjoyed a number of Keanu Reeves' movies, from ""Bill and Ted"" and ""The Matrix"" to the more recent ""Constantine.""  ""A Walk in the Clouds"" is one of his forays into the romance genre, and it's a favorite of mine in that category.  The story begins during the waning days of WWII, where Army veteran Paul (Reeves) arrives in San Francisco after four years of combat.  He makes his way home and surprises a wife he barely knows.  After an awkward reunion, she practically shoves him out the door the next day with an admonition to start raking in the bucks by selling chocolates.  The life of a traveling salesman is not what he had in mind, but he decides to make a go of it for her sake.

On a train bound for Sacramento, Paul literally bumps into Victoria, a mysterious, attractive Latino woman (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who immediately vomits on him.  After a couple more odd encounters, they wind up together on the side of a country road.  She tearfully informs Paul that her grad school professor-slash-lover impregnated and then dumped her.  She fears that her ultra-conservative, autocratic father Alberto (Giancarlo Giannini) will kill her for soiling the Aragon family name by returning home an unwed mother.  A scheme is hatched where Paul agrees to pose as Victoria's husband for a day, and then abandon her so she can save face.  Of course, things don't quite work out so easily, especially when Paul and Victoria begin to have feelings for each other.

""A Walk in the Clouds"" is a visual and relational treat.  The scenery of the Aragon estate and surrounding vineyard is almost otherworldly in its lush beauty (hence the movie's title), and made me want to book the next flight to California wine country (even more than ""Sideways"" did).  More impressive was the close-knit traditional Latino family atmosphere, dramatically embodied in the sensual winemaking ceremony, where the married women dance the newly harvested grapes into juice.  However, all is not perfect in paradise.  Alberto is threatened by his non-traditional daughter and Stanford educated son, who wants to apply modern business theory to the old-world winery.  ""Gringo"" Paul becomes the focal point for his insecurities, and their conflict escalates towards an uncertain and traumatic resolution.

Some have criticized Keanu Reeves for having a ""wooden"" demeanor.  True, he's not the most expressive performer in cinema.  But his low-key acting style perfectly fits the character of Paul, a man of the stoic WWII generation dealing with PTSD and his status as an orphan.  I was able to sympathize with and root for Paul throughout his journey, and I commend Mr. Reeves for enabling me to do that.  The other actors also turn in excellent performances, especially the late Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro, the chocolate loving, brandy drinking sage patriarch who takes Paul under his wing.  He provides a good contrast to Giannini's driven Alberto, so concerned about preserving his family that he's forgotten how to love them.  And I can't leave out the lovely Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, whose passionate and intelligent Victoria is the thinking man's movie-character catch.

""A Walk in the Clouds"" is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen, and it holds up well under repeated viewings.  Highly recommended.

WARNING:  The next paragraph has some SPOILER content, but for those concerned with moral content I want to comment on Paul's character and must do so within the context of a choice he makes.

I was surprised and gladdened that Paul was an honorable man who valued family relationships and put the needs of others before his own desires.  He doesn't take the easy way out from his albatross wife, even after finding the woman and family he's always longed for.  Paul perseveres through sexual temptation, not because of dogma, but because he cares about Victoria and doesn't want to hurt her.  Despite his feelings for Victoria, he demonstrates loyalty to his shallow, materialistic wife and tries to work things out.  That kind of virtue is somewhat rare in a Hollywood production these days, and lends a welcome old-fashioned, family-friendly air to the movie (END OF SPOILER).",1109980800,99,4171,4.998550724637681
741654,3,6303949436,"This is a romantic drama that is entertaining, despite Keanu Reeves' somewhat leaden performance and the overly contrived plot. Look to the late Anthony Quinn for a wonderful performance as the benevolent grandfather, who knows true love when he sees it. Look to the beautiful damsel in distress, affectingly played by the lovely Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, with whom Keanu Reeves ultimately falls in love. Look also to the erotic, grape crushing dance and the idyllic cinematography. Overlook the ridiculous ending scene where one is almost embarrassed for Giancarlo Giannini and the rest of the cast.

The movie plot is simple. World War II veteran returns home to the woman whom he had married just before he left to go to war. You get a sense of what is to come, when she is not at the dock to meet him, as he arrives after a four year sojourn. Puzzled, he goes home and finds her there, and you have to wonder what he ever saw in this dolt, notwithstanding her lovely figure. She seems totally uninterested in him as a person. She never even bothered to read the almost daily letters he sent her, which is why she never even knew he was coming home.

He goes off to his former job, that of a traveling chocolate salesman, even though it is clearly not something he wishes to do. While on his journey, he meets a beautiful woman named Victoria, who has a problem. You see, she is pregnant by a man who does not wish to commit himself, and she is on her way home to her close knit family in the idyllic Napa Valley. She is terrified of telling her very old fashioned father, played by Giancarlo Giannini, of her situation and is weeping copious buckets of tears over the expected confrontation. What does Keanu do? Why he suggests going home with her and posing as her husband, while she breaks the news to her family of her purported marriage to Keanu and her pregnancy. Once this is done, Keanu will ostensibly desert her and go on his merry way.

He tries to leave a number of times, but is initially unsuccessful. It is clear that he would prefer to stay.

He doesn't really get any better as the movie goes on.  Oh well, the only other Keanu movies I've seen are his ""Bill and Ted"" movies and I admit I quite often found myself reminded of his ""Ted"" character.
But aside from from this the movie overall was very enjoyable.  I am a part of the minority that is offended by nudity, sex, and foul language in movies and TV.  Face it, Hollywood just doesn't make too many high quality romances geared toward this minority group.  We want good old-fashioned, leave all your clothes on till after the wedding, romances.

Look also to the erotic, grape crushing dance and the idyllic cinematography. Overlook the ridiculous ending scene where one is almost embarrassed for Giancarlo Giannini and the rest of the cast. If you do all this, you will probably enjoy the film.

The movie plot is simple. World War II veteran returns home to the woman whom he had married just before he left to go to war. You get a sense of what is to come, when she is not at the dock to meet him, as he arrives after a four year sojourn. Puzzled, he goes home and finds her there, and you have to wonder what he ever saw in this dolt, notwithstanding her lovely figure. She seems totally uninterested in him as a person. She never even bothered to read the almost daily letters he sent her, which is why she never even knew he was coming home.

He goes off to his former job, that of a traveling chocolate salesman, even though it is clearly not something he wishes to do. While on his journey, he meets a beautiful woman named Victoria, who has a problem. You see, she is pregnant by a man who does not wish to commit himself, and she is on her way home to her close knit family in the idyllic Napa Valley. She is terrified of telling her very old fashioned father, played by Giancarlo Giannini, of her situation and is weeping copious buckets of tears over the expected confrontation. What does Keanu do? Why he suggests going home with her and posing as her husband, while she breaks the news to her family of her purported marriage to Keanu and her pregnancy. Once this is done, Keanu will ostensibly desert her and go on his merry way.

Of course, all the best laid plans often go awry, and this is no exception. They fall in love. Even though he could, he refuses to take advantage of her sexually, because another woman, his wife, has a claim on him. You gotta love this guy! He tries to leave a number of times, but is initially unsuccessful. It is clear that he would prefer to stay. When he finally leaves and returns to his so called wife, he gets a not so unwelcome surprise. A surprise that guarantees that all will be well in the end. Though the outcome is predictable, it is still a moderately enjoyable film.",1093824000,,2583,4.479830148619958

741662,1,6303949436,"I saw this originally in the theatre, but caught it again on late night TV recently. What a disappointment coming from the director, Alphonso Arau, of the sublime classic ""Like Water for Chocolate""! ""A Walk in the Clouds"" is cut from another bolt of cloth completely -- the treacly, sentimental ""women's movie"" of the 50s -- and utterly lacking charm, intelligence, realistic emotion or even plot coherence. Be warned that this is NOT the delightful magic realism of ""Water for Chocolate"".
There are so many lame, unbelievable details that its almost cruel to mention all of them. Paul (the flat, affectless Keanu Reeves, incapable of expressing anything remotely like romantic love) is a chocolate candy salesman who carries around ONE box of sample candy...in the heat of late summer. Apparently he is unconcerned about it melting in the heat or even about replacing the samples he offers to potential customers. Instead of selling the candy door to door in his native San Francisco, he somehow boards a train for Sacramento (even hotter!) but ends up in ... the Napa Valley. (Please consult a map to see why this is utterly ridiculous.) BTW: Look for Debra Messing (Will and Grace) in a small, thankless role as Paul's unfaithful wife.
Victoria (Aitana Gijan) is a Mexican American graduate student who has gotten pregnant by her married college professor, and is inexplicably returning home to Napa, where she will face the anger and scorn of her traditional Mexican family. Anyone who could have written this knows exactly nothing about the period (just after the end of WWII) and is in a kind of denial about the real lifestyles of Mexican American women at that time. I'll bet that there were precious few Mexican Americans (men or women) attending graduate school at Berkley at that time, and if there was, it would remarkable and worth commenting on. Even a basic 4 year college degree was a big deal in the 40s, let alone a master's. (Ms. Gujan, who is very lovely, nonethess is a little too old to be playing a college student.) Additionally, it is more likely that an unwed pregnant girl of that time, with disaproving parents, would have gone to a home for Unwed Mothers and given her child up for adoption. There simply was not the casual acceptance of illegitimate children at that time -- it was a genuine scandal -- and that's easy to forget today when the very word ""illegitimate"" has practically disappeared from the language.
Paul and Victoria decide to pretend to a sham marriage to fool her parents -- for one night! -- and then he'll abandon her, leaving her and the baby to the sympathy of her family. This definitely sounds like a plan that is NOT going to work right from the get-go, as everyone is (no surprise) highly suspicious of the situation. The two have prepared so little that they couldn't fool a bored INS investigator about their ""relationship"", as they clearly know nothing about one another.
Although the story appears to start in summer and warm weather (the characters are wearing summer clothing), six hours after arriving at the family winery, the weather turns cold enough to actually cause the wine grapes to FREEZE. In other words, the temperature dropped from the 70s to below freezing...in September. This isn't really normal for the Napa Valley, which is the chief wine growing region of California precisely because it is so temperate. (BTW: the Aragon family lives in a kind of high-style palazzo that looks more like the ostentacious home of a 90s-era film producer than a real working vineyard.) It is a sad comment on this whole film that the views of the vineyard are misty CGI paintings, rather than real photography...a strange choice when the area being referrenced is known to be one of the most beautiful and photogenic in the world!
Anyways, as the grapes are freezing, they put out gigantic smudge pots and all the characters grab giant silken ""wings"" and run out to the vineyards to perform rather elaborate ""dances"" to direct the heat to the grapes and prevent freezing. This looks and is perfectly ridiculous. I am also surprised that it works! Apparently so well that every member of the family apparently SLEEPS with such wings at the ready in case of sudden unseasonable frosts. (Victoria runs out to flap wings in her silk nightgown...a nightgown which a couple hours earlier she was too embarassed to allow Paul to glimse her in....how come she isn't shivering in this thin sleeveless garment when the presence of frost clearly indicates that the temperature is below freezing?)
The movie is literally one gaff filled moment after another, like those I have mentioned above. The next morning -- after the freeze, which has miraculously lifted and the temperature gone back to the 70s -- it's harvest time! The next day! and a couple of days later...you got it. The entire vineyard burns to the ground...except one tiny blackened root which is, YUP, it's the foundation root brought all the way from Spain hundreds of years ago. Apparently they are going to restart an entire several hundred acre vineyard with ONE ROOT.
I know that director Arau is Mexican and probably wanted to reference as much of his beloved homeland in this project as possible. Certainly there is a long history of Mexican Americans in California, so he had lots of choices. But I am fairly certain that the vast majority of vineyards in Napa were ITALIAN in the 1940s. Any of the hispanic actors cast could have convincingly played Italians and the old film this is based on was itself Italian. Making everyone Mexican is no more believable than making them Swedish or Lebanese...it's an affectation and utterly unrealistic.
The whole movie has the feeling of a stale, artificial tasting bon bon (not unlike the candies that Paul is half-heartedly trying to sell) -- old, dried out, tasteless, synthetic and generally unpleasant. There is a place for old fashioned romance in movies, but ""A Walk in the Clouds"" sure is not it.",1088899200,13,5971,4.854901960784313

So I don't see why so many people label Keanu Reeves as being ""wooden"". OK, so he's not well-known for the romantic movies (unlike a Mr Grant), he's normally disabling bombs, or trying to figure out whether he is The One.
This film is definitely one of his best. Everyone else has gone through the storyline on this, so I won't! I will say Keanu looks great in a uniform, and does what Bruce Willis for little white vests - yummy!
The scenery is absolutely breath-taking in this movie, as is Keanu - OK, sorry, I had to slip that in!!!
A pre-Will & Grace Debra Messing stars in this, as Paul's wife, Betty. During a friendly game of hockey with his friends during spare time, Keanu's lip was split, requiring six stitches (which must have been a pain for the director), and a kiss from Debra Messing in a scene, he had to tell her not to hurt him!
Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n plays the beautiful Victoria Arag&oacute;n, although there's several unnoticed continuity problems, as her hair seems to go from wavy to straight every couple of scenes! This is her first mainstream, and she hasn't appeared in a lot of other mainstream movies. Anthony Quinn also stars, as the interfering grandfather, Don Pedro Arag&oacute;n, who almost seems to know that the couple aren't really married, which takes a while for the rest of the family to figure out.
This is a terrific romance, a lot better than anything that features the ubiquitous Mr Grant. And definitely a must, if you had a bit of a lonely Valentine's Day. Who says romance is dead?",1076889600,4,1669,4.604026845637584
741719,5,6303949436,"When I use the term Adult Fairytale, some might think of films like, ""The Princess Bride"" or ""Ever After"" but ""A Walk in the Clouds"" is a more suitable example. Director Alfonso Arau has created a magical story peopled by outsized characters and placed in a spiritual world called the Aragon Estate. The film permits we mere mortals to visit this world, a Spanish style winery nestled in California's Napper Valley. We arrive along with Paul Sutton, Keanu Reeves; a stranger in a strange land.
Paul's background is economically exposed at the start of the movie. A man returns from World War II, hoping to greet his wife whom he met and married just before shipping out. He dreams of a meaningful life, surrounded by a loving family. His small goals are those of an orphan who has had a lonely life and whose ordeals in battle have condensed his wishes to the simple, important things. Sadly his wife, Betty, is more interested in money and its trappings. She has a lot of spirit but little heart or interest for Paul's modest ambitions. He no sooner arrives than he is pushed out the door to earn some money selling chocolates; a job he wasn't enthusiastic about even before the war.
At this point we are still grounded in the real world, although Paul has an unearthly element to him that is hinted at. For example, any soldier that writes a letter to his wife every day, despite receiving virtually no replies, has more than the average dose of hope and optimism. The real world serves as a backdrop for the rest of the film, contrasting starkly with the soft images, haunting score and honest dialogue that characterises life at the Aragon Vineyard. On a train journey to one of his sales calls, Paul meets Victoria Aragon. She forms a bridge, between these two worlds, that Paul traverses in a series of jerks and lurches. A run of accidents result in Paul volunteering to help the beautiful but miserable young woman. I'm certain these accidents represent fate taking a hand in the lives of two who are destined for love.
Victoria is played by Aitana Sanchez-Gijon in her first English speaking role. Victoria's problem, being unmarried and pregnant, is magnified by having to face a traditionalist family and a strict and passionate father, Alberto. The solution seems obvious to the chivalrous Paul. He suggests playing the part of her husband, a man who fears responsibility and will soon leave her. In this way Paul hopes her honour will be maintained in the eyes of her family and any bitterness will, instead, fall on his absent shoulders. It is a good plan, only complicated in execution by the couple's growing love and Paul's desire for the rich family life that Victoria takes for granted. The turning point seems to come during a family ritual, performed after picking the harvest. All the married women are enticed into a large wooden vat to crush the grapes. This prosaic activity is actually a lusty and sensual attempt to harness the ancient powers of some fertility god. Not even Paul can stand against Victoria's almost unwitting seduction. This is truly one of the sexiest pieces of footage I can remember seeing; and all without resorting to nudity or the sharing of body fluids.
Another rope around Paul's neck is the family's patriarch, Don Pedro Aragn, played with amazing assurance and grace by Anthony Quinn. Don Pedro seems to see through all deceptions, going straight to the heart of the matter. He guides, prods and manipulates Paul to discover, and even pursue, his love of Victoria. In fact if I have any criticism of the film it is that next to Anthony Quinn, Keanu seems like a wooden doll, particularly during the preparations for the drunken serenade. But even this seems appropriate for Paul's character, so inexperienced in the ways of family.
Several Journeys take place in the film; Paul's path from orphanage to family, Victoria's reluctant steps from deception to honesty, her father Alberto's change from taskmaster to loving parent. Even the audience takes a journey. We start out wanting to escape our troubles with a little light entertainment and walk away looking inward, trying to decide if we are on a path as fulfilling as that of Paul and the Aragn family. ""A Walk in the Clouds"" clearly rejects mindless materialism, a philosophy mirrored by Paul's war-bride rejecting him. Instead we are asked to believe that family, honest labour and honour make up the soil our soul should take root in. We may not all have root stock as steeped in tradition as the Aragon's but like Paul, perhaps we will have the sense to recognise rich earth when we see it.",1058140800,19,4604,4.777917189460477
741720,4,6303949436,"While Keanu Reeves belongs to what I call the ""Paper Bag"" school of acting (namely, that is, what he couldn't act his way out of) this movie manages a sweet charm all of its own. I believe that many people have discounted this film mainly because of its star (who before recently was known more for playing Ted ""Theodore"" Logan than Mr. Neo ""The One"" Anderson). While the film may follow the traditional story of two people pretending to be in love and then actually falling in love, it is told in such a sweet manner that it's hard to find fault with it.

The bad part is that this lady is unmarried and must face her very strict parents. Reeves' character agrees to pretend to be her husband just for show, but ends up falling madly in love with her.

No, Reeves does not present the best acting performance around, but he works here--the ""wooden"" side of his character seems to be necessary--this is a young kid, just back from war, who has found out that the woman he married isn't at all what he thought she was.

741723,3,6303949436,"This is a highly enjoyable, sentimental romance movie.
Thing is, I'm not much on sentimental romance movies. But this is so visually stunning, filled with such beautiful imagery and gorgeous music, that it will take your breath away.
But what I find really fascinating about this movie is that it breaks an implicit contract between the viewer and the filmmakers. And it does it with such huge impertinence and utter disregard for this silent, unspoken trust that I find it outrageous, shocking, incredibly funny, and, in a strange way, admirable.
What is that implicit contract between viewer and filmmakers? It's that, unless the movie is outright science fiction or fantasy, you are being told truths about the world we live in. For instance, if you are being shown things in a movie that is placed in a particular historical time period, you assume that at least some research was done to make an attempt at an accurate portrayal of that time. And if you are being shown things about a business or a process that most people know little about - in this case winemaking - then you will learn some true things about that business or process.
Not in this movie.
Here's an example: this movie teaches us that if frost falls on a crop of grapes at a vineyard (and it's quite true that frost can kill a crop of grapes), the workers go out at night with candles and torches, and then they don huge white wings on their arms that make them resemble giant white moths. Then they go through the fields flapping their giant wings to warm the grapes and keep the frost away with the warmth of the torches and candles, creating a spectacle of unearthly, ghostly beauty.
No they don't! They never did that! Not in real life! The filmmakers just made this up! It's really funny when you think about it!
But it sure LOOKS good!
In another touching and lovely scene, the young Spanish girl's grandfather, who owns the vineyard, (wonderfully played by Anthony Quinn), sings to Keanu Reaves one of the oldest and most beautiful songs in the history of Spanish music. Oh, it's beautiful all right - no argument there. He speaks of this classic with the reverence that such an old and gorgeous song deserves. However, if you note the credits at the end of the film, the song was composed by the film's composer and a lyricist in 1995, the year the film was made! Well, it SOUNDS like a very old and classic song! But they made this up, too!
Why did they do this?  I don't know!!  But it's funny!!
I'm pretty sure that the ceremonial crushing of grapes to erotic dancing and music is not and never was a part of any vineyard that is actually in the business of making wine, certainly not in the last 100 years, but I couldn't swear to it. But it fits this very aptly-named ""Walk in the Clouds"" perfectly.
No real criticisms here. Being a writer myself, it's kind of inspiring to know that if you don't know anything about something, you can just make it all up! Who needs research??
Really, these guys have a lot of nerve. But you gotta love 'em for it. And it all makes for a lovely, entertaining movie.

The movie takes place in the 1940s, and is about a soldier (Keanu Reeves) named Paul Sutton who has just come home from fighting in World War II.  He's coming home to the wife (Debra Messing) who he met, courted, and married just days before shipping off to war.  He gets a job as a traveling chocolate salesman and ends up meeting a graduate student named Victoria Aragon (Aitana Snchez-Gijn) on a train to the Napa Valley.  One mishap leads to another, and the next thing you know, Victoria tells Paul all about how she had a romantic relationship with one of her professors who impregnated her and then left her, and how her father is going to kill her when he learns of this news.  Paul offers to come home with Victoria to her family's vineyard and pretend he's her husband.  Upon meeting Paul, Victoria's father (Giancarlo Giannini) is furious, and Paul spends the rest of the movie actually falling in love with Victoria and trying to convince her father to accept their pseudo-marriage.
I wish I could summarize this movie into one paragraph, but there's so much beauty in it that I find it hard to compress it all into a few words.  The cinematography is the strongest aspect of this movie.  You'll be transported into a beautiful Eden-esque valley that seems too good to be true.
The only reason I didn't give the movie 5 stars is because Keanu Reeves is an absolutely HORRIBLE actor.  There are times in this movie where he's attempting to deliver dramatic lines, and I can't help but to laugh at how much of a fool he makes of himself.  He's a very handsome man, but he's absolutely wrong for this part.  Giancarlo Giannini delivers a powerful performance, but the real show stealer is Anthony Quinn in his role as Victoria's grandfather and the patriarch of the family.

Gossamer wings to dry the grape vines? & what was the deal with that fire? the production company must have used more gasoline on that vineyard than a fleet of ford exscursions going to a junior soccer tournament. Did anyone else find it just a little hard to believe Reeves could pull a 100 year old vine out the ground by the roots? I thought this travesty was supposed to be a romantic movie, not a fantasy. It also seems to me whenever I have experienced a fire over fertile ground, that always grows back,usually healthier than before. I guess that was just another little faux pas the writers missed. I cannot say enough bad things about this movie, mostly because it speaks volumes all by itself. A romance? I don't think so.

Alfonso Arau, who also directed the great film ""Like Water for Chocolate"" uses lush colors, deep and rich, to convey the passion and sensuality, perfectly complimenting the storyline.  Keanu Reeves and Aitana Sanchez Gijon make a beautiful couple and the scenes, such as one where the entire family and workers wear wings to fan warmth on the crops to ward off frost, is like something out of a dream.  The music is beautiful and though the ending is a bit of let down, the story is very romantic and a must have for anyone who likes an old fashioned romance.",1012608000,10,908,4.54601226993865
741864,3,6303949436,"Okay, it's acknowledged (more forcefully in some circles than in others) that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor in the world. I can live with the fact that he's no John Barrymore or Orson Welles. I'm not into romantic movies, neither, so I was going a little against grain by buying this movie. I like the work of Arau for his sheer sense of sensuality. I wasn't disappointed in that respect.
I adore Anthony Quinn, so I especially enjoyed his performance. My favorite character by far was Don Pedro whom I've nicknamed ""Canny Old Guy"" (COG). It was COG who got Paul to stay by eating all his chocolates; it was COG who got Paul intoxicated enough to try to sing to his ""wife""; it was COG with the advice and anecdotes about family life and obligations.
In summation, I liked A Walk in the Clouds. I wouldn't call it a cinematic masterpiece, but it's okay for you romantic types to curl up with on a cold night. Enjoy it with some red wine...or hot chocolate.",1011139200,,960,4.429378531073446

741955,5,6303949436,"Don't believe every review you read. After seeing what has been said about this film, I have to step in. This film is great. Reviewers who panned it by pointing out Keanu's performance would as likely rate a kiss by timing it on their watch, as by feeling anything while it was going on.
I find this film memorable for two reasons. First, the cinamatography was superb. I don't know if those scenes were paintings, or real. But they are well worth the price of admission.
Second, the story is an honest portrayal of chivalry. I found it not a bit pretentious. In fact, I found the choices of honor and heart and belonging, rather heroic.
Considering the nature of the ""professional"" reviews of this film, If there were to be an opening in a film review column in the near future, then perhaps I should find the time to apply.

741956,4,6303949436,The pictures in this movie are wonderful. The story is a bit sad and more than a little far-fetched. It is a story of a traditional romance that is started under unusual circumstances and ultimately leads to a happy ending. Good movie.,1005955200,,235,4.619047619047619

This was my first Keanu, and I believe it shall be my last. I think he might make a very good Curious George, but he's not a good leading man at all. Anthony Quinn at 80 is more attractive than this whippersnapper will ever be.
Other parts of the movie are not so bad, so if you want to go for a stroll, take ""A Walk in the Clouds"", but you won't bump into anything like an excellent movie while you're up there.",1003104000,,634,4.08

He meets a young, unmarried, and pregnant girl on the train and the story begins. Its a story of romance and family traditions.

Of course, it also reminded me how the late Anthony Quinn stole the show with his performance. The only thing that I was disappointed with the DVD was that there was no Language track in Spanish. They only had it in English & French. I was disappointed because if you are watching a film with a Spanish flair to it, why make the alternative language track in French? I would have loved to have seen it in Spanish only because as we all know, Spanish is the most romantic language of all.

The acting is terrible, the plot ridiculous, in fact this movie is so bad it is almost funny, I say almost or I might have given it two stars. Keanu Reeves really embarrasses himself with this one.  He should stick to movies like Speed or Matrix, where all he has to do is look cool and pretty.  This one needed some acting and he wasn't really there for most of it. Nuff said.",997401600,6,493,4.268817204301075
741961,3,6303949436,"This is a romantic drama that is entertaining, despite Keanu Reeves' somewhat leaden performance and the overly contrived plot. Look to the late Anthony Quinn for a wonderful performance as the benevolent grandfather, who knows true love when he sees it. Look to the beautiful damsel in distress, affectingly played by the lovely Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, with whom Keanu Reeeves ultimately falls in love. Look also to the erotic, grape crushing dance and the idyllic cinematography. Overlook the ridiculous ending scene where one is almost embarrassed for Giancarlo Giannini and the rest of the cast. If you do all this, you will probably enjoy the film.
The movie plot is simple. World War II veteran returns home to the woman he had married just before he left to go to war. You get a sense of what is to come, when she is not at the dock to meet him, as he arrives after a four year sojourn. Puzzled, he goes home and finds her there, and you have to wonder what he ever saw in this dolt, notwithstanding her lovely figure. She seems totally uninterested in him as a person. She never even bothered to read the almost daily letters he sent her, which is why she never even knew he was coming home.
He goes off to his former job, that of a traveling chocolate salesman, even though it is clearly not something he wishes to do. While on his journey, he meets a beautiful woman named Victoria, who has a problem. You see, she is pregnant by a man who does not wish to commit himself, and she is on her way home to her close knit family in the idyllic Napa Valley. She is terrified of telling her very old fashioned father, played by Giancarlo Giannini, of her situation and is weeping copious buckets of tears over the expected confrontation. What does Keanu do? Why he suggests going home with her and posing as her husband, while she breaks the news to her family of her purported marriage to Keanu and her pregnancy. Once this is done, Keanu will ostensibly desert her and go on his merry way.
Of course, all the best laid plans often go awry, and this is no exception. They fall in love. Even though he could, he refuses to take advantage of her sexually, because another woman, his wife, has a claim on him. You gotta love this guy! He tries to leave a number of times, but is initially unsuccessful. It is clear that he would prefer to stay. When he finally leaves and returns to his so called wife, he gets a not so unwelcome surprise. A surprise that guarantees that all will be well in the end. Though the outcome is predictable, it is still a moderately enjoyable film.",993945600,2,2576,4.482978723404256

I think Keanu plays his role excellent! He is so compelling as the hero that is just a little shy, but still wants to do the right thing to help out a lady in distress even tho he doesn't even know her.  Making sacrifices in his own life to save her face with her family, and then finally falling in love with her.

  Keanu Reeves(Paul Sutton) is a WW II vet who comes home to a wife he barely knew and has nothing in common with and hits the road to sell chocolates.  On the train and again on a bus he meets Victoria who is a young woman who is traveling home to her family's vineyard although she is also pregnant.  As a nice guy, Paul decides to accompany Victoria home and pretend that they are married.  What ensues is two strangers falling in love as they try to convince her parents that they are truly married.
  This was a great story in which the scenery is spectacular.  Along with some of the fabulous scenes of the traditional harvesting and stomping of the grapes, it is a heartwarming movie injected with a bit of comedy from the rest of the Aragon family.  Although a bit predictable, this was a really well done romantic movie which I enjoy watching over and over again.  I would definately recommend this movie to anyone who is a true romantic at heart.",988502400,18,1159,4.319444444444445

He portrayed his character the best he could and therefore should be respected for his effort. [Personally I find him charming in his role. Whether his insecure ""behavior"" is superbly acted (not everyone has to be a self-secure macho-man) or him, as an actor, being insecure, doesn't matter!] Anyway, she/he who bought it because of Keanu starring in it will love it all the way. All others might look at it as a fairy-tale with gorgeous scenery shots and a happy ending. It's a movie that makes you feel good and entertains you.

742020,5,6303949436,"There are those who may attack ""A Walk In The Clouds"" for the fantasy-like nature of it's storytelling, for the dreamy quality it creates, for simply being, well, unreal. But do most people honestly go to the movies for depressingly real reminders of how cynical and sad the world is? Of course not! We go to the movies for escape, hoping the film we are about to view will pluck our hearts or exhilarate us. ""A Walk In The Clouds"" is a beautifully-done film, the kind that lets us escape and dream, fantasize and smile. It looks gorgeous, director Alfonso Arau films in a landscape that seems more like a painting than a real place. The story is basically a modern fairy tale that takes place in a California vineyard soon after WW2. It seems so unreal, but real at the same time because it basically crystalizes that which we call ""romance."" There are sequences of great beauty, as when the vineyard occupants try to heat frozen vines with giant butterfly-like wings or a scene where grapes are crushed by dancing. These scenes are fun and enticing, but also hypnotic, especially with Maurice Jarre's soaring music which sounds like classic Mexican flavors decorated with orchestral elegance. Okay, so maybe some us find the realities of our world a little too gloomy to ever believe in this kind of hokey romantic stuff, but why can't we hope for an instant? ""A Walk In The Clouds"" gives us hope, it entertains, it tells a good story. Corny applies more to those who attack the film, they obviously have sour, boring minds and wouldn't know a romantic idea even if it kissed them right in the lips. Here Arau presents us a masterpiece, a great movie and a truly romantic work of art.",977011200,,1686,4.623333333333333
742021,4,6303949436,"I think that this movie has a lot more going for itself than people are willing to give credit for. I'm a senorita(younglady)and a romantic, yet my  interest in the movie wasn't directed at how gorgeous Keanu looked, rather  at how Paul came to the aide of Victoria while making a trip back home.  Paul defended her, helped her, cared for her, was distraught over her, and  came to the understanding that he truly did LOVE HER. It's funny when you  think that this all started over a dropped suitcase, the thrust in the  train, and a bit of spit up on a jacket(to put it in kinder words). It's  all about fate...and nobody really knows theirs anyways. So whose to say  this is just a sappy-chic flick? This movie makes you curious over love at  first sight, tough love, unconditional love, and even no love. All you have  to do is be open to experiencing something sincere, cheerful, and possible.  I'm sure that many women see movies like this and wonder where men like  this are, but this is something that keeps everyone's dreams alive. ""A  Walk in the Clouds"" is a walk through my heart(leaving me floating on  Cloud 9). I hope people can get into the shoes of the characters and feel  the depths of these two very unique individuals: From Paul having been  lacking much love in his marital relationship to Victoria having received  too much affection, leaving her a troubled woman. Any person, of any  gender, and of any age can be moved by this film. We can all relate to some  love we would've wished to conquer, a demanding parent, and difficult  issues life has handed us to deal with. Clear your mind of the usual sex,  money, and violence that we're all exposed to on television and be prepared  for something more natural. Because in reality this is what the world  revolves around...LOVE. Allow ""A Walk in the Clouds"" to be the  messenger of that message to you and your loved ones.

742022,5,6303949436,"I read all the other reviews for this movie, and I was amazed at the negative comments the guys made about it.  Well, I'm a guy and I loved this movie.  Okay, so Keanu Reeves doesn't get the award for best dramatic actor  of the century, but he's a lot better than, say, Jim Carey.  I didn't  perceive him as ""woody"" or ""stoic,"" but rather I saw  him portraying a polite and shy young man who helps out a young woman in  distress at his own personal inconvenience.  That's a trait you don't see  very often these days.  It's a pleasant and refreshing change to see a  young soldier who is actually moral and decent and willing to help, even at  personal loss to himself.  Yes, it's a huge chick flick.  So what?  A lot  of chick flicks are great movies, and this is one of them.  Buy it and  watch it with someone you love.  You'll have a great time.  The photography  is spectacular.  The music is great.
