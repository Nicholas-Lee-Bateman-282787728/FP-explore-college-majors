8416348,5,B0044VH9LO,"I really like this film. Caught it many years ago on TV and never forgot it. I own a multi region DVD player. And it has been a great investment. This movie is not available from an American distributer. I found this at a reasonable price from a seller from Germany.
The movie is rare and the only one that Burt wrote and directed as well as starring. It is a murder mystery and the twist and turns keep you guessing. Great cast and local settings help make this one of a different type of film for Burt Lancaster. I really found myself getting into this now period piece. Hard to believe that it is filmed in current then times. It is quite eye opening. Mystery Buffs and Burt Lancaster fans find this movie it is worth the work.",1463356800,2,730,4.258992805755396
