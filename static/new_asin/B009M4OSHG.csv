5351297,5,B009M4OSHG,"This is a classic slice of exploitation with an added bonus:  legendary character Actor Christoper Lee didn't know he was in it!  You see, he didn't realize it was a software S&M film based on the writing of the Marquis de Sade...which is discussed in the bonus material...arguably this is Jess Franco's finest film!  Here is a look at the movie:

5351298,3,B009M4OSHG,"""Eugenie""(1969) is directed by Jess Franco. This movie is loosely based on the Marquis de Sade book ""Philosophy in the Bedroom""(1795), which is the story of a young girl who is taught the pleasures of sex. This film, however, is based in present times, and is much milder than the novel. The movie is beautifully photographed off the south eastern coast of Spain amongst some islands, and it has an alienated, Michelangelo Antonioni feel to it, with scenes of barren sand dunes, and isolated islands, and minimalistic sets. My one beef with the filming though is that occasionally the image goes out of focus, which sometimes may refer to a dream sequence but at other times it just appears as if the camera man accidentally let the lens go out of focus.

Interestingly, Christopher Lee evidently never saw any of the nudity as his parts were filmed separately, or with actors performing behind him, with a curtain which was then swung across when the director said ""cut"". For the most part Lee acts as a narrator, reading parts from the Marquis de Sade's book

This blu-ray looks great and appears to have been remastered. This set comes with a blu-ray and dvd of the movie as well as a CD of the music and a booklet(20 pages) with an adaptation from Stephen Thrower's book ""Murderous Passions, The Delirious Cinema of Jesus Franco"". There are a couple of special features that have interviews with the director and the stars, including Christopher Lee, and the author Stephen Thrower, that are between 16-19 minutes each.",1453334400,10,1523,4.809160305343512

The chain scenes of welcome, worship and death are very tame.  Occasional nude scenes are added here and there. She ends up living

8542923,3,B009M4OSHG,"This movie traces the journey of a young girl from her innocent state to the participation in degradation. I thought the man playing the brother (sort of ) to be very good in his part. I have seldom seen a better portrail of a true preditor. Disturbing, but interesting, this is a movie not for the faint harted, and with that said, recommended.",1456531200,3,345,4.492063492063492
