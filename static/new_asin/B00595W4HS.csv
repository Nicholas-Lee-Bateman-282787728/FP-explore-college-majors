8462699,3,B00595W4HS,"At first I hated Nick Cannon.  I thought he was one of those ""Hey look at me, I'm hilarious"" types when he first opened up for America's Got Talent several years ago, but I've grown to really admire the man and find him to be an insanely likeable personality on TV.  I admit I was wrong with my first impression and will freely admit it right here.  However this particular comedy routine leaves a lot to be desired.  He's better than this and he knows it, and I believe everyone else knows it too.  Stooping to mentioning his love for Mariah Carey and basically bragging about it, and frequently making jokes intended for edginess and cheap laughs get old after a while.  That's the main problem I have with this performance.",1347062400,3,726,4.5038167938931295
8462700,1,B00595W4HS,"I generally love Nick Cannon and always find him likeable in his interviews and other tv/entertainment snippets (I also think he is a talented entertainer/actor/singer/rapper/lyricist just to name a few hats he wears), but I found this show to be alienating.  I subscribe to the notion that one can find truth in comedy...however, (a big HOWEVER) this comedy seemed a little bitter to me; it felt like a case of sour grapes (to put it lightly).
Myself, I often feel justified and bitter toward the northeast region of the U.S. because I grew up in the south and am living in the northeast region now and people constantly make fun of Southerners in the northeast and hold Southerners back from educational and professional opportunities.  [Just to let you know my demographic info: I am a white (caucasian to Nick)female in my mid 30's.  I am also a Lamb and belong to the Lambily.] So, I feel like I can understand Cannon's perspective a teeny bit...if I stretch it.
So, I am disappointed in his show because I feel like it was more of a mockery of the white/Caucasian couple in the front row, a chance for him to let everyone know he's married to Mariah Carey in case anyone didn't know, and to let everyone know that he hates white people for being born white...and that he also treats them significantly different than other folk.",1338422400,,1334,4.6680851063829785
