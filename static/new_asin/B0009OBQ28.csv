8064181,4,B0009OBQ28,The label was glued to a broken box and was pretty rough. However the disk was okay. The Cinescopes were dark and fuzzy but I suppose that is customary based on the technology at the time. Liked the first aircraft. This was supposed to be the first season but the newer Cessna was featured. Something was not exactly right.,1445558400,,323,4.491525423728813
8064182,5,B0009OBQ28,Fun to watch.  Brought back my youth!,1430265600,,37,4.285714285714286
8064183,5,B0009OBQ28,"If you remember Sky and Penny, take a look.  I can't believe we used to watch this show every Saturday.  I truly enjoyed these episodes, again!",1407369600,,143,4.461538461538462
8064184,5,B0009OBQ28,"While a child back in the 50s this was my favorite Saturday morning show. Not cartoons, but Sky King. Loved it. Great seller performance. Thanks for the wonderful service",1338422400,2,170,4.896551724137931
8064185,3,B0009OBQ28,"There are 72 Sky King episodes, 4 of which are in the public domain. The public domain episodes are The Wild Man, Sky Robbers, A Dog Named Barney, and Bullet Bait. Those episodes are included on this disc. They are the same episodes included on the Sky King: Vol 1 TV Series disc issued by Gotham Distribution and offered elsewhere on Amazon at a much, much cheaper price. The rights to episodes that are not in the public domain are owned by Flying Crown Enterprises and are offered as a complete set elsewhere on Amazon.

If you are a Sky King fan, as I am from my youth, you will enjoy these four episodes, but will likely want more at some point, if you can afford the cost of the complete set. I watched these four episodes a few times, held out for a few months, then could not wait any longer, finally ordering the complete series. I am poorer, but much happier, thank you very much.",1318982400,2,890,4.3293413173652695
8064186,4,B0009OBQ28,"I bought 2 Sky King Videos of old TV shows. Both had different covers but both contained the same four episodes. One DVD stated the shows were from ""1951"" and the other DVD said ""1958"". Be careful when ordering multiple dvds of the same actor to make sure they are not duplicated. One cost $7.98 and one cost $4.98",1211760000,12,314,4.338983050847458
8064187,5,B0009OBQ28,I would certainly recommend this vendor.  I got my item on time and in great condition.,1182816000,3,87,4.4375
8064188,5,B0009OBQ28,This DVD has the same four episodes on it as the Sky King Vol 1 DVD with the color cover.,1164758400,27,89,3.5
8064189,4,B0009OBQ28,"I have nothing against this four episode release from Critics Choice of the ""Sky King"" series . . . the episodes look fairly good (though far from pristine), the price is right, and a couple of the episodes even include original vintage commercials (a real plus among collectors). So why the ""Buyer Beware"" title?  The episodes included on this DVD are the exact same four episodes that were released on another DVD from Alpha Video which Amazon also carries.  Apparently, only four episodes from the series lapsed into the public domain and that's why multiple releasing companies are offering the same episodes.

The four star rating is well deserved for this entertaining show that many of the Baby Boomer generation enjoyed during the 1950s and 1960s and can again, thanks to this DVD release.",1159833600,42,797,4.932835820895522
