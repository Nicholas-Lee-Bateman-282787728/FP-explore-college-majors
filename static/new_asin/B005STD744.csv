8485436,4,B005STD744,"Charlie Rose is the incomparable Charlie Rose in this nice tribute of interviews remembering the late Steve Jobs. I was hoping to see the interview with Mr. Jobs himself, but that could be on another DVD. Great for one's SJ collection.",1489536000,,235,4.7560975609756095
8485437,3,B005STD744,"It's ok, I expected more considering it's Charlie Rose. Some of the interviews contradicts information that I've read in the W. Isaascon's book.",1446422400,,144,5.304347826086956
8485438,1,B005STD744,"After 20 minutes into the program the sound quality was muted and I couldn't hear it, nothing to do with my own sound system. I believe the program sound quality is flawed.",1442275200,,172,4.40625
