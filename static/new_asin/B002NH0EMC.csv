3959291,5,B002NH0EMC,"In all my years of going to concerts this is the best I have ever seen.  You can see how QPRs experience over many years has made this a never to be forgotten concert. Brilliant also were Freddie's parts, which showed that he will always be remembered with love, by fans of all ages and nationalities. I was amazed at the 350,000 crowd and their reactions to all the songs.
Paul Rogers, well, what more can you say about this legendary performer. Both he and Queen were perfect for one another musically.
This is my favourite DVD next to Queen 1986 Live at Wembly.
Thank you QPR for such a wonderful experience.",1355443200,,611,4.455357142857143
3959293,5,B002NH0EMC,I saw this same show in Ga. Great to be able to re-live the concert. I love the Queen Music as well as the Bad Company and Free. I also enjoy the new songs. The huge crowd has awesome energy and the band gives an all out performance!,1275696000,4,233,3.875
3959295,4,B002NH0EMC,"Die-hard Queen fans who have gotten over the 'Freddy's gone, nobody should replace him' thing will definitely love this concert dvd. For those still living in the past, just skip it and You Tube some Freddy stuff from 1980 or something. Seriously, though, this was an amazing concert, over 350,000 Russians rocking out hard to a fast-paced, energetic concert.  The band was in top form and Paul Rodgers again proves why he is considered the best rock singer, period. He continues to amaze with his ability to take songs that were so definitely Queen hits and reinvent them and give them an entirely new feel. He brings a raw, bluesy feel to hits like I Want to Break Free, Crazy Little Thing Called Love and the Show Must Go On, the latter never having been performed by Freddy Mercury live, making it feel more like a Paul Rodgers creation. The new tunes, C-Lebrity and Rocking the Cosmos are uptempo and played with ease by the band. My only complaint would be too much indulgence in some of Brian May's and Roger Taylor's 'pet project' songs and not enough time for Rodgers' own material. He does an understated, lovely version of Shooting Star, but a few more chances for the band to play some more Free music would be better. All in all, a nice compromise for both Queen fans and Paul Rodgers enthusiasts.",1266105600,,1310,4.622317596566524
8375056,5,B002NH0EMC,I had a personal reason for buying the DVD.  My girlfriend lives in Kharkov which is where this concert took place. When I watch it I see the restrauant where I met her. Beside that it is a great concert. The inter-action between band members and the audience is amazing.,1375142400,,271,4.42
