7926320,3,B00004XQPA,"I have had this for a while.  It will tell you a thing or two about CCW that you may need, but it is meant for the beginner.  I was fairly informed before I saw this so it was kind of meaningless.  Also, you kind of have to buy into Lenny's mentality which I don't really.  It is well executed and accurate.  It would be a good primer for real CCW training and knowledge quest.",1170806400,,377,3.973333333333333
7926321,5,B00004XQPA,"I watch the video and learn the basics of such disciplene(Concealed Carry) for a responsible gun ownership thinking. What i like best is the portion where mr. magill pointed out the situation that ""it should not be a cause of further violent escalation ... it is not always nessesary to always introduce a gun...the best thing is to AVOID a situation as possible"". The techniques presented on this video are very helpful to me and  safety is always given a good emphasis.",1166054400,3,471,4.7439024390243905
7926322,3,B00004XQPA,"This DVD only covers one aspect of concealed carry - the mechanics of ""how"" to carry a firearm.

Unfortunately, the instructor does not delve into the personal and legal aspects.

For a beginner, there are some useful tips that could save you some money.  Most people learn through trial and error.  By demonstrating the various methods, it better prepares you to make a more informed decision about how to carry a firearm.

There is too much focus on speed of presentation and reholstering.  These are skills that are better taught in a class with a real instructor, instead of on a DVD that is clearly aimed at beginners.

Overall it's a good product.  The DVD is nothing more than a transfer of their VHS version.  There are no special features.  I have seen this video used in concealed handgun licensing classes, because it is a good overview of carry methods.

If you are interested in pursuing a CHL license, this is a decent primer on ONE aspect.",1104624000,5,954,4.652694610778443
