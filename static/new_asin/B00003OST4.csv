7919192,5,B00003OST4,Gene Wilder can be so incredibly charming and believable.  It's one of the few films I like to watch over every few years.,1414972800,,122,4.304347826086956
7919193,5,B00003OST4,"PLOT: Emma has a good cause and wants to leave her MILLIONS TO THE JEWS TO FLEE NAZI GERMANY BUT someone has to stop her before she can change her will.

1938~ Emma Sachs has plenty of LEACHES who want her money~ Niece and her fiancee, always Broke Nephew and ill teated Companion to Emma and lets not forget the Housekeeper and of course the NAZIS who are hot on Emma's trail. After Emma is posioned local law and his friend CASH CARTER (Gene Wilder) are drawn into the case. CARTER is a director of plays and is very good at ""reading"" people which helps solve crimes. This is about GREED for a good cause. Filled with colorful  staff and relatives and we toss in the Playboy Nazi who speaks perfect American English. We have plenty of MOTIVES for murder. ADDED fun is the tacky play CASH is now staring in since his leading man became ill and this moves along very well. co written by GENE WILDER it is very good. GREAT writing, excellent plot and very good actors who play the ""suspects""~ I GIVE THIS 5 STARS IT MOVES ALONG VERY WELL. ALSO SEE MURDER IN A SMALL TOWN THE FIRST IN THE SERIES OF  TWO CASH CARTER MYSTERIES TV MOVIES MADE FOR A&E~",1337731200,,1147,4.300925925925926
7919194,5,B00003OST4,"Do you like Plays in the theatre? Old fashioned mysteries? Did you like radio drama? If so, this one is for you.

Gene Wilder is in a different role. Gene Wilder is not up to his usual slapstick in this one, but shows a stronger, more in-depth and more sensitive character. There are two story-lines going on at the same time, and like in the movie Clue, the viewer is in a race with the actors to solve the crime first.

Very interesting use of pre-WW II music. In the film noire tradition, the subject is deep and dark.  It unfolds like a Play, and while there are only 3 or 4 sets to go with the 3 or 4 acts, the cast is masterful in presenting non-stop drama that comes to a very satisfying conclusion.",1171929600,2,706,4.176470588235294
7919195,5,B00003OST4,"Gene Wilder shines and shines us on in this second Cash Carter franchise flick for the A&E cable network.  The beauty of the film's fabric is in the mesh of intricate details interwoven with a fairly simple and straight  forward murder plot which pales by design to the real slaughter the Nazi  regime is wreaking in 1938 Germany...  One of the secondary storylines,  which revolves around an anti-Nazi German Jew who ""gets her man,""  is played out with such effective power and style that the impact leaves us  stunned...  Other stylistic touches add to the realistic portrayal of the  period depicted--especially the jargon of the times, where everything was  ""swell"" and a 1930's song and dance number or two was  obligatory...  In other respects, some of the many rich detailed details,  which some reviewers felt hurt the so-called tepid murder mystery aspect,  may perhaps be viewed as clever take-offs on the murder mysteries of the  1930s--much like Gene Wilder's ""Haunted Honeymoon"" film was a  great send up of horror flicks.  Filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,  ""The Lady In Question"" (1999) has a terrifically talented cast  (special kudos to Kate Trotter for her powerful portrayal of the anti-Nazi  German Jew), outstanding production values, and a real flavor of and feel  for the late 1930s.  Gene Wilder seems to allow his ""boys"" and  girls to play out the story on many levels while simply orchastrating the  grand scenario of the ""bigger picture"" as seen from many little  perspectives--all wrapped around a simple little murder, which is actually  just a small killing when compared to the slaughter of Jews going on at the  time in Hitler's Germany... Highly recommend this seemingly charming little  murder mystery which has many layers and levels--so watch it twice!  And  don't be fooled by the apparent over-use of so many Cash Carter (Gene  Wilder) reaction shots--his face speaks volumes on the horrors of the  times.
