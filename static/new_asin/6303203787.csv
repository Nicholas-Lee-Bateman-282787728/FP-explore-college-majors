7840951,5,6303203787,"This is a little pricey, as its out of circulation, but I feel it was absolutely worth it. For anyone who read the 1980's romance novel--it is an essential film to see. For others, if you are a fan of period dramas like A&E's Pride & Prejudice or the rendition of Wharton's The Buccaneers, then Princess Daisy will likely fall within your interests. For an 80s mini series, it's surprisingly timeless. Well acted and charming, with a plot that manages to be different yet unsurprising. I was in love. I wish to goodness Princess Daisy would be recirculated.",1407283200,4,557,4.6938775510204085

fairy tale sled scene through the park, not shown in DVD ?",1378512000,,163,3.9696969696969697
7840954,1,6303203787,"The quality was so poor on this tape that I could not continue watching.  I have bought books and visual entertainment for several years through Amazon and this was the first time the product was unusable.

It might have been a good idea for the seller to warn the buyer that the picture is blurry and the sound quality bad.

I'm sure this was a one time event and I will continue to purchase merchandise from Amazon.

7840955,3,6303203787,"Like any good book that is made into a mini-series - Princess Daisy has all the qualities that we look for in bringing printed characters to life on screen.  There is lying, cheating, seduction and of course love.  I enjoyed the film; in fact I'll be sure to watch it again.",1170288000,3,274,4.352941176470588
7840956,1,6303203787,"This is a really dull, dumb TV mini-series, but then I'm probably not the audience for it.  I only got it because it had some of my favorite actresses (Lindsay Wagner, Barbara Bach).  However, this show is about 3 hours 15 minutes long, and Lindsay Wagner dies after the first half hour.  Barbara Bach has about fifteen minutes total screen time, maybe less.  So it's a disappointment on that level.

That leaves the film, which is not much.  It's a 1983 TV mini-series based on a Judith Krantz novel.  Filled with TV actors and actresses.  Contrary to its marketing, the star is not Lindsay Wagner, but Merete Van Kamp, a Danish actress who came out of nowhere and went nowhere after this mini-series.  Van Kamp tries to do an English accent, but instead sounds like she has a lispy speech impediment.

Story is really dumb, tenuously inspired by the real Princess Grace, at least its first half hour.  Lindsay Wagner plays an American movie star who marries an exiled Russian Prince (Stacey Keach).  Then Wagner tragically gives birth to twin girls, one retarded.  Keach hides the retarded girl, telling Wagner that only Daisy survived.  When Wagner learns the truth, she runs off into hiding with both girls.

Then Wagner tragically dies in car crash.  Keach reclaims the girls, but then he tragically dies in a plane crash.  By now Daisy is 16, and her evil half brother tragically rapes her.  So she leaves England for America, but then she tragically loses her trust fund in a corporate bankruptcy.

But Daisy is gutsy and smart, so she struggles her way to the top in the fashion industry.  She has an affair with that actor from STARSKY AND HUTCH, who tragically cheats on her.  Then she helps her tragically ill step mother.  Eventually she falls in love with TV actor Robert Urich (who plays a self-made tycoon, so we know he's a great guy).

But just when everything looks great, Daisy's evil half brother tragically reveals the truth of Daisy's retarded sister to the tabloids.  The scandal tragically threatens to destroy Daisy's happiness.  But Daisy survives, her man Urich stands by her, everyone loves her, and her evil half-brother tragically commits suicide.

Oh yes, there's also a bit part for Lysette Anthony as the evil half-brother's floosy mistress.  Horror fans will remember that Anthony later went on to do the DARK SHADOWS remake, and TRILOGY OF TERROR remake.

Barbara Bach co-stars here with hubby Ringo Starr.  They play a parasitic catty couple.  Bach does this weird accent that makes her sound like Patsy from ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.  Bach keeps saying, ""Dahling, dahling!""  She and Starr are the highlight of the film, a funny, gossipy, catty couple.  Take them away and this tragic piece of idiocy tragically wouldn't even merit one tragic star.",1149292800,12,2779,4.857142857142857
