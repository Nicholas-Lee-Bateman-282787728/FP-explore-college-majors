4847553,5,B005NHQ1WQ,"This is the second product put out by Exercise Physiologist and PrayFit Founder, Jimmy Pena, and much like the PrayFit book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prayfit-Your-Guide-to-A-Healthy-Body-and-A-Stronger-Faith-in-28-Days/dp/B004C43WQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prayfit: Your Guide to A Healthy Body and A Stronger Faith in 28 Days</a>, I was very interested to check out the PrayFit:33 DVD (the 33 refers to the number of years Jesus was on the earth). I mainly stick to working out with weights in my home gym but I like to change things up and try different stuff.
No equipment is required for this program, which is good and it could easily be done in a living room or bedroom or even at the park with the itunes version. Watching the DVD all the way through before trying the workout, I found myself thinking that it looked simple and should be fairly easy, then I quickly remembered that's what I thought about the 'book' exercises, too, before I tried them!
The DVD gives you the option to workout with Jimmy's instructions or just the music, which I thought was a great feature (though I can't see myself using it). Most DVD's (and I've tried a lot of them), can get really annoying listening to what the instructor says- over and over again. But Jimmy is very encouraging and ties in a lot of stories and struggles from biblical characters that really get you thinking about his mandate to view our ""health as a means of praise."" In other words, this is the sort of encouragement I want to hear everyday.
Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in the DVD-

Introduction:
Here, Jimmy gives an explanation of the 33 day total body challenge, ""that will have you building strength, burning fat and improve your overall level of conditioning in just 33 minutes a day.""  Just like the book, the workouts are progressive, which means you try to do a little more today than you did yesterday and so on. The program targets upper body, lower body and core as well as cardio. There's also stretching, called ""flexibility"" work. Each exercise is preformed in a modified manner by one of the workout participants for those who find it difficult to do the standard exercises.

Warm-up:
I admit, I'm the worst about getting a warm-up in before I start working out, I usually just start and then regret not taking the time for it, so I'm glad it's built into the program. The warm-up includes basic exercises like jogging in place and jumping jacks.

PrayFit Strength:
In this section you will do two rounds of four exercises for 30 seconds each, which seems simple enough. None of the exercises are complex and Jimmy shows you how it's done before you get started and coaches throughout, giving tips on the how and why.

PrayFit Challenge:
There are 3 challenges in the program and this is where you track your numbers to try to beat your own record the following day. It's basically, how much of a given exercise you can do in 33 seconds. The challenges fall in-between the main exercise groups of Strength, Cardio, Abs and Flexibility. Again, the genius here is, it doesn't matter if you can only do 5 push-ups in 33 seconds or 45, your total is YOURS to beat, you are competing against yourself, so it's for all fitness levels. Inside the DVD jacket is a handy workout journal to track your totals from day to day. Additionally, there is information there about the website, Prayfit.com.

PrayFit Cardio:
This section repeats the program format of 2 rounds of 4 exercises for 30 seconds each. Some of the exercises used in the warm-up are used again here. I love the 'jumping rope' without a rope, why didn't I think of that before?

PrayFit Abs:
This section includes your basic ab exercises, nothing funky and still no equipment required.  Jimmy does the exercises much slower than I typically would which at first seemed easy, but it really forced me to focus on the muscles being worked instead of just tearing through them like I have the tendency to do. By the end of the ab portion of the program I was definitely feeling it. The double crunch might be new and therefore difficult for some but the modified version is very doable.

PrayFit Flexibility:
This segment is really just stretching and it made me remember how good it feels to stretch after a workout. Much like 'warming up', I tend to just want to do my workout and that's it, forgetting the important pre and post work. The stretches aren't difficult, but doing them showed me how far I've slid backwards in this area since my Tae kwon-do days, I definitely want to reincorporate this for renewed ""flexibility.""

PrayFit Minute:
There are 4 PrayFit Minutes on the DVD and are easily accessed on the main menu. These are short, encouraging 'video devotions' if you will, given by Jimmy, that serve to encourage the viewer in their new or renewed quest for health.

Wrap-up:
The DVD is very easy to follow, Jimmy gives the viewer plenty of time to get situated for the next exercise, he's very encouraging and his passion for fitness is contagious. Though I work out regularly, I was sweating up a storm by the time I finished and really felt like I had worked out. I will be doing the PrayFit 33 day challenge with a group come January 2012, so I'll be able to give a report on how I feel after doing the program for 33 days.
My only complaint was the DVD `menu music' was so awesome I was hoping it would be the workout music, too! It felt like a `call to battle' and was very motivating, which I'm sure is what Jimmy is trying to do, call people unto the battlefield- to get serious about their health and fitness.",1324512000,115,5635,4.722278738555443
4847554,5,B005NHQ1WQ,"Praise God.

Build your body like a solid foundation so that you may be better able to serve the Lord.

In a certain sense, this is a Bible-based workout.  ""Prayfit: 33-Day Total Body Challenge"" is about exercising for approximately 33 minutes a day for 33 days in order to improve your health and heart.  The concept of 33 refers to the number of years that Jesus was on earth about 2000 years ago.

Throughout the workout, Jimmy Pena gives us quick inspirations and encouraging snippets from the Bible. Workout is for the beginner to intermediate.  Mr. Pena instructs 3 women and one man, and one of them shows easier moves. This is a solid workout and I enjoyed it and I liked Mr. Pena's positive attitude and encouraging messages.  No equipment is needed, except maybe a mat for the abs workout.

4847556,5,B005NHQ1WQ,"This video is an excellent exercise program. What I like most  is that there is a person in the group that does low impact exercise for those who are unable to do the high impact exercises. So it is great for a seasoned athlete as well as those who are just starting to exercise or may have health problems that prevent them from exerting their joints and their bodies.
This video is for everyone. It is lively, motivational and full of fun. It is as if the instructor is right in your home!

We love the fact that it is Christian themed and that everyone is appropriately dressed...we were so discouraged trying to workout with DVD's where women were exposing their certain body parts and men with no shirts...this is refreshing to see that you don't have to dress that way to work out...and that we are working out to make our bodies healthy like the Lord created us!,1438300800,,436,4.75

Still very disappointed as the men were wearing modest shorts, why not the women? Every item of clothing does NOT have to be tight tight tight or obvious. Christian workout dvd's can be modest and there are plenty of cool looking, figure flattering (women are responsible for how we dress and make men think. This is a responsibility of Christian women and we should respect the way God created men, respect other women's husbands-- dress respectfully so we are not the reason for causing a brother to stumble).. The workout itself is OK. Not for those of us who are used to Jillian Michaels, or a good long distance run.

4847635,5,B005NHQ1WQ,"The woman at my church and I are doing this workout DVD together every Tuesday.  For some reason we thought it would be easy, but we were hurting real bad for a few days after our first workout, which is a good sign!  We like it because Jimmy Pena uses Biblical reasons why we need to keep our bodies in shape, and we also like that we don't need any extra equipment, just our own body weight (you might want to bring a mat, though, because you will be on the ground doing push-ups and sit-ups).  We also like that it only takes 33 minutes to get through.  We recommend it!",1347840000,,573,4.135135135135135
4847636,5,B005NHQ1WQ,"I received Prayfit in the mail today.  I just finished watching the workout, tomorrow I will actually DO the workout.  I like to watch a workout the first time before actually doing it so I know what I'm in for.  This is truly a workout for any level of exerciser.  There is one person that does the modify workout for easier moves until you're able to do the more advanced exercises.  I'm happy with this workout because it's something that is doable without killing me in the process.  I've had workouts that were extremely challenging to the point of me not enjoying the workouts and having the dread factor of doing them again.  Jimmy Pena is very motivating and I don't see a dread factor here.  It's not a praying workout, but Jimmy does say some things from the bible to keep you motivated and it's not overly preachy for those of you that may be turned off with a praying workout.  You don't need any equipment to do it.  You may need an exercise mat if you don't have carpeting for when you're doing the floor exercises.  All in all, I think I will be very happy with doing this 33 day challenge (33 minutes long).  The DVD also comes with a 33 day challenge chart to keep track of your workouts.  There are 3 Prayfit challenges (33 seconds each) that he tells you to remember so you can try and beat it the next day and you note those challenges on your chart.  Challenge 1 is Pushups, Challenge 2 is Jump Squats, and Challenge 3 is Double Crunches.  It also has a space to chart personal notes for each day of your workout.  This is a perfect amount of time for those days when you don't have a whole lot of time to devote to working out.  On the days where I'll have extra time, I can also pop in another exercise DVD to do afterwards.  This 33 minute workout covers strength, cardio, abs, and flexibility.  I hope this review helps.

4847637,5,B005NHQ1WQ,"I didn't think it was much to it, everyone has ""the best"".  This is honestly worth it.  Really a great work out.  I got tired doing it, but the motivation and the encouragement helps.  Doing it 3 times a week and noting some change. I have bad joints and am overwieght and in 30 minutes (33) I have time to get a full cardio, strengthening and tone, get a shower, eat breakfast and a good, encouraging Word of Scripture. All in about an hour!  Though it is repetitious, you just press toward a better goal the next time.  Love it!",1346284800,2,530,4.25
4847638,3,B005NHQ1WQ,I am a Christian so I was super excited to do a workout that combined health and faith.  Some of this dvd reminds me of P90x in that you have exercises where you log how many reps you did that day and attempt to do more in the following days.  It is different from P90x in that you do the same exercises every day for 33 days-which I find a little too boring.  I like the guy but he sometimes loses track of time (especially in the abs and stretching section) by talking too much.  I am going to give it a full 30 days and see what shape my body is in.,1340150400,11,552,3.8584070796460175
4847639,4,B005NHQ1WQ,"I purchased this back in Feb or March 2012 and have used it at least 3-4 times a week since I received it.  I am SO toned I can hardly believe it.  I actually have muscles and definition to my arms, thighs, buns, and calves.  I still have a bread basket to my lower abdomen that I'm trying to lose, but I no longer have muffin tops to deal with.  I am absolutely amazed at the fast results from this DVD without using any equipment or accessories.  I'm the first to admit I HATE to exercise!  Absolutely HATE it with a passion... but when I started seeing the results in a fairly short amount of time, I was inspired to continue on.  I also HATE to sweat and within the first 3 exercises of the strength training I'm sweating like a pig.  My favorite part of the whole DVD is when he says ""Come on, you can do it!  5 more seconds""

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because he says it's four exercises for 33 seconds in each category (strength, cardio, abs, flexibility) but I quickly discovered he gets to chatting a little too long on the first round of abdominal crunches and you do it for closer to 1 minute 15 seconds.

This is the first time that I've ever felt compelled to write a review... I hope it helps encourage someone to give it a try.  It really is a tolerable and very ""do-able"" DVD

4847643,5,B005NHQ1WQ,"I just got this DVD, and have been working out to it for about 6 days.  I work in physical therapy, eat healthy, jog about 3 miles a few days a week and am generally fairly fit.  So I was pretty surprised when I started on this workout and got out of breath. By the end of the 33 minutes I am sweating and tired.  This is a pretty good workout for beginners because he has a person in his group that shows how to modify.  He encourages you to challenge yourself, but doesnt ever say you have to do as many reps as he is or one of the other people on the video are.  I find too many workout videos don't take into account people have to start somewhere.
This workout has simple exercises and a good mix of strengthening, cardio, abs and flexibility.
Over all I think it is a very good workout with good Christian motivational comments by the leader throughout.",1329004800,10,859,4.181818181818182

I'm on day 3 of the challenge, and it works!  I was a little disappointed when I fist put the DVD in and realized there wasn't multiple programs.  My disappointment faded as soon as I started the program and realized, 1 is all you need!  I have been running 3 - 6 miles or riding my bike for 8 - 12 miles 5 days a week, so I'm not completely out of shape, but I was sore after day 1!
