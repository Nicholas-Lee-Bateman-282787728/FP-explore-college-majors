8531594,5,B008X6K4BI,"Code Red found the original 35MM film negatives for this entertaining drive-in classic from 1969.  This transfer is far superior to previous releases, and highly recommended by me.  The film contains such subplots as a jailbait May-December affair, a biker gang, lesbianism, and political blackmail.  The wonderful Patricia Wymer stars as Candy, the beautiful babysitter with a taste for the wilder side of life.  This film is a prime example of the ""softcore"" films that played drive-ins and grindhouses before the advent of hardcore.  It was originally rated X, but then downgraded to R.  Thanks to Code Red for taking the trouble and expense to restore this thought-lost uncut version.",1349308800,6,688,5.209090909090909
