3145908,5,B0015LPS28,"Oban Star Racers is one of those TV shows that once you catch an episode you're immediately drawn into the story and have to see more. After seeing almost all of the series in syndication, I knew this is one of the few shows I had to own. It's more than just an action-packed racing story, it's also a sweeping drama about the pain and struggle of a broken family and the longing for redemption and love. Oh, and the fate of the universe too, if that's important to you.

  But you came for the review of volume 2, didn't you? The first volume of Oban Star Racers was a great start to the story, setting up the characters, problems, stakes, and mysteries of the series. The preliminaries are finished on the planet Alwas, and in volume 2 of Oban Star Racers, the race finally moves onto the series' namesake - The planet Oban, where the true races begin. Not only do the races heat up with the Earth team facing the greatest racers in the galaxy, but the drama does as well, as Don Wei starts to suspect that Molly is not truly who she says she is.

  The animation is top notch as always in the second volume. The japanese style of character animation is visually pleasing and does it's job well, and is expertly combined with the 3D cell shaded animation of the racers and environments during the races. I don't think there has been a series or movie that has combined these two elements as seamlessly as Oban has, and the diversity of locales in this volume is even greater than the first. The races will engross you, dragging you down when the Earth team takes their losses, and making you want to cheer when they experience their victories! And as the mysterious threat only hinted at earlier in the series looms it's dark head, the drama only increases as you devour every episode.

  The DVD menus are pleasing and easy to navigate, and the special features are good as well, giving you in-depth insight into how the series was made, continuing from the first volume.

  If you're a fan of animation, drama, racing, or just anim in general, Oban Star Racers is a must-see. And if you like it, Oban Star Racers Volume 2 is a must own. (Especially if you own the first volume!) So go and get it people!",1239148800,4,2207,4.4088669950738915
3145909,5,B0015LPS28,"My seven-year-old son and I faithfully watched this series when it aired on Jetix, and I waited a long time for the series to be released on DVD.  Here's what makes it so good:

The animation is first-rate, as is the voice-acting.  The characterizations are believable, consistent, and complex.  The good guys face choices that aren't clear-cut or necessarily heroic, and the antagonists, with the exception of one or two 100% evil characters, have their own issues that can make them more sympathetic, if not exactly rootable.

This plot arc, more than that of the Alwas cycle, is suspenseful and almost never cliched.  The surprises are thought-provoking and emotional.  Even my son, who is not usually big on female protagonists, was moved.  I bought this series on dvd, because my son and I like to rewatch it regularly, because the plot is deep and complex enough to offer new information to him as he gets old enough to catch it, and because the story is poignant and on-message for how I want my son to see the world someday.",1219881600,9,1032,4.726256983240224
3145910,5,B0015LPS28,"The series maintains its consistency for the second half in pretty much every way. The field is smaller this time as we change venues to Oban itself, and the nature of the races change along with it. This works pretty well as it gives the series some diversity. Each race in this volume also takes place in a different region, so the courses change quite a bit. Pitting all the racers against one another in each race made it quite interesting, and the venues introduced in this volume is really quite unique.

A number of story elements from the last volume become more significant in this one, including the reasoning behind the sabotage and the dark forces Rick discovered near the end of the last volume. The story certainly certainly takes some more dramatic and darker turns in this volume as well, but it still stays in the family friendly territory. The series doesn't try to mask pain and loss, but it does present it in a way that isn't going to heavily impact younger viewers.

This volume presented a few twists that I didn't see coming, and I particularly liked that. Generally shows of this nature have a certain predictability to them, and while this is still sometimes the case, this series still is able to avoid that trap pretty well. Heck, the ending itself didn't follow any of the paths I thought it would take, and that's the kind of surprise I like.

The artwork retains the style and feel presented in the first volume, and keeps the quality up as well. This is particularly impressive due to the large number of changes in scenery in this volume, which was undoubtedly a lot more demanding of the animation team. Since the finalists consist of a smaller field of only a handful of racers, there's also a bit more emphasis put towards developing them as well.

This was a great conclusion to a fun title that is definitely worth a watch, if this sort of show is your thing. Certain mature elements are still lacking, and there's nothing in the way of blood and gore or fan service; so steer clear if those are important to you. The story gets a bit darker this time around, but not to a large degree, and not to the point it will negatively effect younger viewers. Like the last volume, this one is also presented in dub only, but it is a strong dub, and international production was the goal of the creative team.",1212278400,7,2338,4.533175355450237

For the most part it is harmless, but there are very dark moments - where there is this Crow looking Demon thingy...his voice is creepy, he looks creepy.  Other than that, it was pretty good.

If you like some action, esp. racing, and love that nostalgic feel of watching episode after episode, give this series a try. You won't be disappointed. Just make sure you have time because it's one 'race' and espisode after another and this might actually keep you up. Good thing each chapter is 'short' and there are only two volumes and you're done. All in all, Oban is a great pastime. Curious how a movie or non-anime would fare but then again, I'd hate to see an Avatar movie retake.",1395446400,,567,4.461538461538462

3145929,3,B0015LPS28,"As with most sci-fi (not just anime), you have to suspend reality and accept the world that is being presented. However, it is usually the sci or fi parts that need reality suspension. This anime series has good points and bad points. The story is compelling, but has large gaps as to the some of the characters' motivation. I liked the series and recommend it, but I wouldn't compare it with the likes of Cowboy Bebop, Last Exile, or Rahxephon.",1364515200,,445,4.575
3145930,5,B0015LPS28,"Hi, this is my 2nd review of the 2nd set of DVD's of this series.
I purchased this set of DVD's because I liked the series when it was broadcast on the Disney channel.
It is a story of a broken family. The mother that was a racer, died in a racing accident. The father despondent puts his daughter in a boarding school and disappears, but later forms a racing team and forgets about his past.
The daughter leaves the school with the help of a scooter and searches out to re-bond with her father, but her father does not recognize her, so she changes her name to be close to him.
Worlds are selected across the galaxy to race once every 10,000 years to determine the next Galactic Avatar to rule over all races of people. There is danger, flying cars, interstellar travel, a re-bonding of father and daughter and in the end peace.
The computer animated CGI is quite note worthy when the racer is racing around the obstacles on the various planets!
Rated ""G"" for all audiences.
I highly recommend this Anime for old and young kids alike.",1358553600,,1035,4.424083769633508
3145931,5,B0015LPS28,"This was the best 600 minutes ever (23x26)!
I wish it had been longer, actually.
I wish there was another adventure!

I love these beautiful stories.
The sights and sounds move me emotionally every time.

This was a clean and kid friendly ""movie"".
I would recommend it to anyone!",1358380800,,279,4.673469387755102
3145932,5,B0015LPS28,"This was a request for a Christmas present from my Grand Daughter.  Since she is familiar with the series, I'm sure she will be happy with the gift.  I was pleased with the order and delivery process

3145933,5,B0015LPS28,"Semi-warning: Okay the characters have no noses, a lot of people were freak out about it. It's not a big deal, after two episodes you'll get use to it.

Six years ago I was in middle school and obsessed about this show.
It's very rare to see animation like this. It's not action pack with explosions and violence or other stuff. Oban holds a certain charm to it, like the movie Spirited Away. Yes this animination is about intergalactic racing and whoever wins the final race will get a prize, their one wish granted. Even though that's too good to be true and there seems to be more to this 'wish' then what's being said. Either way, the competitors are optimistic and determine to be the winner. Like Eva who actually tells the crew members of the Earth team her name is Molly (an attempt to hide her identity from her mean father whose the manager of the team).
  She does everything she can to win every race so she can get her wish granted; to bring her deceased mother back to life.

Would I watch the whole series again? Yes. This a show any age can watch too.
Did I cry like a big baby at the end of the last episode? You betcha. It's was bittersweet in so many ways but I'm glad it ended in that kind of direction.
  Even though it's been almost a decade, yhis show will always have a spot in my heart.",1355529600,3,1311,4.244979919678715
3145934,5,B0015LPS28,"After watching the first one, I COULD NOT WAIT to get my hands on this.  Absolutely one of my favorite anime series, right on up there with Scrapped Princess, Noein, and Zone of the Enders.  I enjoy stuff that feels more like an RPG than fighter games.  I don't like stuff with ""demons"" in them.  While this one contains a bad guy that looks similar to a ""demon"" from just about any other dark anime show, knowing that it's just another race from another planet helped to separate the concept and made this a very enjoyable show.  Get it while you can at a low price.  This series is doomed to get more expensive as people who enjoy it won't want to let go of their copy.",1355011200,4,671,4.244094488188976

So i always look for more stories that will take me back to the feelin when i first watch anime and this is one of them it was a wonderful story very catchin the price is great for the episodes u get 13 in each volume for like [...] bucks pretty good.

3380426,3,B0015LPS28,"As with most sci-fi (not just anime), you have to suspend reality and accept the world that is being presented. However, it is usually the sci or fi parts that need reality suspension. This anime series has good points and bad points. The story is compelling, but has large gaps as to the some of the characters' motivation. I liked the series and recommend it, but I wouldn't compare it with the likes of Cowboy Bebop, Last Exile, or Rahxephon.",1364515200,,445,4.575
3380427,5,B0015LPS28,"Hi, this is my 2nd review of the 2nd set of DVD's of this series.
I purchased this set of DVD's because I liked the series when it was broadcast on the Disney channel.
It is a story of a broken family. The mother that was a racer, died in a racing accident. The father despondent puts his daughter in a boarding school and disappears, but later forms a racing team and forgets about his past.
The daughter leaves the school with the help of a scooter and searches out to re-bond with her father, but her father does not recognize her, so she changes her name to be close to him.
Worlds are selected across the galaxy to race once every 10,000 years to determine the next Galactic Avatar to rule over all races of people. There is danger, flying cars, interstellar travel, a re-bonding of father and daughter and in the end peace.
The computer animated CGI is quite note worthy when the racer is racing around the obstacles on the various planets!
Rated ""G"" for all audiences.
I highly recommend this Anime for old and young kids alike.",1358553600,,1035,4.424083769633508
3380428,5,B0015LPS28,"This was the best 600 minutes ever (23x26)!
I wish it had been longer, actually.
I wish there was another adventure!

I love these beautiful stories.
The sights and sounds move me emotionally every time.

This was a clean and kid friendly ""movie"".
I would recommend it to anyone!",1358380800,,279,4.673469387755102
3380429,5,B0015LPS28,"This was a request for a Christmas present from my Grand Daughter.  Since she is familiar with the series, I'm sure she will be happy with the gift.  I was pleased with the order and delivery process

3380430,5,B0015LPS28,"Semi-warning: Okay the characters have no noses, a lot of people were freak out about it. It's not a big deal, after two episodes you'll get use to it.

Six years ago I was in middle school and obsessed about this show.
It's very rare to see animation like this. It's not action pack with explosions and violence or other stuff. Oban holds a certain charm to it, like the movie Spirited Away. Yes this animination is about intergalactic racing and whoever wins the final race will get a prize, their one wish granted. Even though that's too good to be true and there seems to be more to this 'wish' then what's being said. Either way, the competitors are optimistic and determine to be the winner. Like Eva who actually tells the crew members of the Earth team her name is Molly (an attempt to hide her identity from her mean father whose the manager of the team).
  She does everything she can to win every race so she can get her wish granted; to bring her deceased mother back to life.

Would I watch the whole series again? Yes. This a show any age can watch too.
Did I cry like a big baby at the end of the last episode? You betcha. It's was bittersweet in so many ways but I'm glad it ended in that kind of direction.
  Even though it's been almost a decade, yhis show will always have a spot in my heart.",1355529600,3,1311,4.244979919678715
3380431,5,B0015LPS28,"After watching the first one, I COULD NOT WAIT to get my hands on this.  Absolutely one of my favorite anime series, right on up there with Scrapped Princess, Noein, and Zone of the Enders.  I enjoy stuff that feels more like an RPG than fighter games.  I don't like stuff with ""demons"" in them.  While this one contains a bad guy that looks similar to a ""demon"" from just about any other dark anime show, knowing that it's just another race from another planet helped to separate the concept and made this a very enjoyable show.  Get it while you can at a low price.  This series is doomed to get more expensive as people who enjoy it won't want to let go of their copy.",1355011200,4,671,4.244094488188976

8259150,5,B0015LPS28,"Oban Star-Racers accomplishes in 26 episodes what most animes can barely do in 50; to get the audience to truly care for the characters and story. Most extraordinary of all is that it achieves this without the use of blood, sex, and overtly epic, dramatic, comedic or cheesy scenes. From the very beginning, the heroine knows what she's fighting for. True that it isn't until later on that she discovers how deep things go, but most anime heroes don't even get the first clue of what their mission is until the 15th episode. Furthermore, the intelligence and depth of OSR equals that of a successful young adult novel series. In fact, it's practically the anime version of The Hunger Games. The plots are strangely similar considering that OSR came out two years before THG; a rebellious 15-16 year-old girl competes in a televised event that will determine the fate of humanity. Despite this, the girl is competing solely for personal reasons; to save her family. Moreover, both stories deal with themes of ""the inevitable"" and what it takes to move ahead after having experienced great trauma. The only difference is that they each handle these themes differently, and OSR is set in outer space.",1482105600,,1197,4.872549019607843
