7751705,5,B01FRMOXIK,"CRITERION COLLECTION has done it again! Teshigaharas Woman in the Dunes (1964) offers of course the ultimate in cinematographic experience, one of a handful of truly exceptional films that continue to grow on you (I first saw it in 1971). Roger Ebert (in 1998) called it radical, hard-edged and challenging and detected an almost pornographic underlying situation, for Strictly Film School it is a spare and haunting allegory of human existence.  In its reincarnation on this superbly re-mastered Blue-ray disc for home viewing, Woman in the Dunes exerts its magic in an even more compelling way.

With Woman in the Dunes Teshigahara to me seems uniquely and almost effortlessly to transcend the constraints of his chosen medium as he meshes the different elements of camera, script and soundtrack into a seamless web of meaning. In that sense talk about Sisyphus or parable of life (Ebert) only gets in the way.  As the woman lies asleep naked and exhausted and the camera closes in on the combined texture of skin and sand, all the meaning you want is there. Just watch  and surrender.  In the end thats what the man does as he decides not to escape and so finds his freedom: final shots that couldn't be more haunting for the meaning they convey. Seven years later the authorities finally list him as missing. Only then do we find out what he was called. MESMERIZING!",1480032000,12,1370,4.837606837606837

7751707,5,B01FRMOXIK,"Pure, sublime cinema. One of the greatest adaptations of literature ever. Get the movie. Get the book. Consume them in any order you like. Repeat. Reap the rewards of Abe and Teshigahara.",1477267200,6,187,4.875
7751708,4,B01FRMOXIK,"The physical setting defines the jail: inescapable, a continuous threat to a tenuous existence, and backbreaking, nonsensical toil for the necessities of life. If parts of the premise don't follow normal rules of logic, that's OK. This is about the imagery and about the people that lock themselves into less literal but equally constraining prisons.

So, it's best to take this as it presents itself and absorb the Kafka-esque illogic of it. We are not a logical species, and some truths have little to do with literal facts.

7751711,5,B01FRMOXIK,"I saw this movie at a film archive many moons ago, and it was one of those very few theatrical experiences which are so deeply impressive you can count them on your fingers.  Over the years, I tried watching this movie on standard definition only to be disappointed by the loss of texture and detail which make it so unique.  Well, Criterion has truly done one of their greatest jobs on this masterpiece, allowing the home viewer to experience it in all the astonishing cinematheque glory it so richly deserves.  Tears began to well up in my eyes as I watched the minute waves of sand rolling down the hillside - you can literally see each grain!  The macroscopic beauty of skin during the lovemaking scene, the barbs on the legs of the captured insects - all stunningly sharp and tactile!  I am reawakened to what really great cinema can be - profound ideas articulated in vivid physical, sensual terms.  I couldn't stop thinking about this movie for days afterwards, just like the time I first saw it.  BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO CRITERION!",1474934400,32,1033,4.642857142857143

8761396,5,B01FRMOXIK,"A Japanese masterpiece, Woman in the Dunes had me in a trance from beginning to end. The film takes place almost entirely in a sand pit, and if that sounds claustrophobic, well, it is. But that's the point. It's sort of a meditation on being trapped in life and the power struggle between men and women. The cinematography is beyond gorgeous and the acting is top notch. It's one of those films that will stick with you after a while. I still think about the sand seeping through the roof of that shack. If you have any interest in Japanese cinema then I implore you to check this one out.",1510012800,,589,4.363636363636363
