8324973,5,B000BF2K9I,"This is a unique independent film.  It has Drama, Action, and mystery.  The characters are believable and you find yourself getting emotionally connected to them by the end.  The ending of the film is perfect.  It goes for an emotional conclusion rather than a logical one.  The cinematography is at times, breath-taking, filmed in scenic New Zealand.  For being filmed on mini-DV, it looks amazing.  Not many D.P.'s can accomplish such a cinematic look with mini-DV.  The acting for all the leads is really great.  If I recall correctly, the film won a few awards at the microcinema film festival.

Also, I really enjoyed editing this film.",1129593600,7,641,4.906542056074766
