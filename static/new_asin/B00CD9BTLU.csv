5716032,5,B00CD9BTLU,"this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to learn yoga with Tao unless you're in NYC and she is so calm, descriptive, intuitive, and in tune with US wannabe yogis! A great person to learn from!",1392163200,,193,4.243243243243243
5716033,1,B00CD9BTLU,"The few reviews that were written were all 5 *'s, so I felt confident that this would be a good, solid yoga routine.  Very disappointed that the first segment (The Beach Workout) was a no-talkie.  Tao doesn't provide any verbal instructions in this segment.  It is a sit back & watch her do yoga.  In the second segment Tao provides instructions to Tara Stiles who demonstrates the movements.  I was able to follow along & do the yoga.  The last segment is an interview conducted by Tara with Tao.  Out of the 3 segments to this DVD only one is a yoga workout for the viewer.  I returned this DVD & hope to be reimbursed, soon.",1380844800,19,627,4.344827586206897
5716034,5,B00CD9BTLU,"Now you can practice with a true yoga master, someone who has lived it all of her 95 years!
Tao is evidence that living your yoga is the key to a lifetime of health, happiness and purpose.
Loved Tara Stiles as the student, there is much to learn from Tao. You will enjoy the interview
as well. Tao's approach to some of the poses is not what you usually see and is well worth the
exploration. A great addition to your yoga library.",1378944000,4,431,4.204819277108434
5716035,5,B00CD9BTLU,"Having practiced yoga for 50 yrs. & taught yoga for 20, I was absolutely up lifted by this DVD.  Tao is an example of what yoga does for us.  I did the sequence with her & Tara Stiles this morning & it was great.  This DVD is one to have & practice; more like real yoga than the up-dog, down-dog DVDs your most likely to find.",1377129600,5,326,3.909090909090909
5716036,5,B00CD9BTLU,I absolutely love this video.  The first segment is a wonderful practice by Tao - just amazing.  Then there is another segment where she practices with Tara Styles - so glad I bought this video - can only hope to be half the person she is at that age.  Yoga is certainly the fountain of youth,1376784000,8,292,4.178571428571429
5716037,5,B00CD9BTLU,"What a wonderful example she is of ""Use it and you won't lose it!""!  The best exercise for all seniors everywhere,",1374278400,3,114,4.428571428571429
