7986725,1,B00008T2IT,"The book is much better. No one died in the book, but for some reason the film makers felt it was necessary to kill off some people. I used to read the book to my 4th grade class every year, so I know it well. It was one of my favorites, and the movie doesn't even come close to doing it justice. It was almost painful to watch. Read the book. You won't regret it.",1390953600,2,364,3.8666666666666667
7986726,3,B00008T2IT,"I originally saw this on TV years ago as a child and it fascinated me. I taped it off of the TV but eventually lost the tape. I spent years looking for a copy that I could purchase and I was thrilled when I discovered a couple of years ago that they were releasing TWOWC on DVD in England (as it is a British film). I ordered my copy from Amazon UK right after it was released and, as I have a region-free DVD player, I haven't had any problems playing it. I was completely stoked to have a ""real"" copy at last!

After I saw TWOWC on TV, I was inspired to read the novel by Joan Aiken. While the movie is fairly faithful to the book, there are some plot and character differences that I'm sure readers of the book have noticed. While I still love the movie just as much as I ever did, one of the things that really struck me when I read the book is how different Bonnie and Sylvia are characterized in the book versus the movie. This is the thing that takes away a little from my enjoyment of the movie. In the book, Bonnie is described as assertive and impulsive, but she's not mean and she never insults or gets annoyed with Sylvia. She loves Sylvia and treats her like a sister. Emily Hudson's Bonnie is assertive to the point of being bratty and insolent, and she makes several negative remarks toward Sylvia, rolling her eyes and so forth. The girls are supposed to be very tight, yet with the way Bonnie acts in the movie, one would wonder why Sylvia would want to have anything to do with her. She's often a little b#$%&. Sylvia, on the other hand, is also very different in the movie from her counterpart in the book, In the book, Sylvia is described as sensitive, mild mannered, and physically fragile, but she's not stupid and she's not a character with no personality. She's very intelligent and often picks up on things that Bonnie misses. Aleks Darowska's Sylvia is sort of a pushover who is led around for most of the movie by the overly-aggressive Bonnie. She doesn't have much to say and lets Bonnie steal the show. She's just sort of ""there.""

While there are other differences between the book and the movie, I really wish they had gotten the girls' characters right. There's a close bond between them that is the heart of the novel and it's missing from most of the movie. They're together a lot in the movie, but they don't seem to have as much of a bond. Bonnie's too bitchy and Sylvia's too meek. In the end I would say that the movie is very entertaining, but the book is richer. The movie focuses too much on Miss Slighcarp (Stephanie Beacham, the big star). You can see even on the cover for the DVD her image is larger and more prominent than the images of the two girls. I think that clearly says something about the focus of the movie!",1387238400,4,2763,4.311538461538461
7986727,5,B00008T2IT,"What a great pleasure it was to stumble on this movie available on Amazon Prime Instant Video. One of my favorite childhood classics was transformed into a memorable Gothic English tale of good and evil, of the power of greed and theft of freedom and birthright versus the power of goodness and friendship -- it all played out against the backdrop of a remote manor house besotted by wolves. Well-written, and well-acted by young girls of quite some talent, the darker incidents in this movie are too intense for young children but provide compelling suspense for adults and fans of Jane Eyre type of entertainment.",1350345600,2,615,4.866666666666666
7986728,3,B00008T2IT,"An OK adaptation of a classic, this movie is available in the US on Netflix, at least for now.  This was one of my favorite books as a child. I read it when it first came out in 1963! I'm still looking for the serialized adaptation of Blackhearts in Battersea.",1344556800,,260,4.2
7986729,5,B00008T2IT,"I first saw this movie on the Disney Channel and absolutely loved it.  I actually thought most of it was much better than the book, which was also very entertaining.  I have been hoping year after year for this fabulous feature to come out on a USA version of DVD.  My DVD player does not play internationally and a lot of the ones that do rarely work for all regions even though they say they do.  Please highly consider putting this out for US viewers.  This is from a classic children's novel and wonderfully done with an excellent cast, gorgeous costumes and mysterious twists and turns, not to mention it portrays industrial England and the working conditions for children in a very accurate way.  Please put out on US version!",1332547200,4,732,4.592307692307692

We also listened to the book on tape while on a rainy vacation, it was wonderful!",1189382400,5,249,4.369565217391305
7986731,5,B00008T2IT,"I discovered this movie around Halloween, on the Disney Channel, in the early to mid 90's and just fell in love with it. Always a fan of anything Victorian, I proceeded to watch it over and over again, and taped this wonderful production which is quite accurate to the book, except for the ending, which I actually like better than the novel.  This is pure family entertainment with fantastic acting, gorgeous sets and costumes and hauntingly perfect for any fan of classic children's literature, whether you are 8 or 80.  I have very few movies left that need to get on DVD, but this is definitely one of them.  Please put on DVD so we can follow the adventures of Bonny, Sylvia, an evil governess in disguise, her sidekick, and faithful servants of the Willoughby family, as well as an accurate pictoral of the conditions of Mid-England during the Industrial Revolution and the condition of working class children in mills.  One of the best versions of a book to movie of a children's classic I have ever seen.",1152316800,14,1012,4.668539325842697
