4395878,5,B004K7M6U6,"Within the first half hour I already knew this was my new favorite film.  Visually beautiful, smart and funny, with moments of such clarity of insight that they stick with you for days after and make you want to watch it again and again, in case you missed anything.  It might help if you know something about punk and something about Islam, but anyone can understand and identify with the struggle to reconcile two seemingly incompatible world-views.",1300406400,4,451,4.8441558441558445
4395879,5,B004K7M6U6,I thought this movie gave a very interesting look at the American Muslim culture.  Of course one point of view but something I found engaging and interesting.  Worth a watch and I think a movie that has a lot to it.,1387756800,,215,4.219512195121951
4395880,5,B004K7M6U6,"The Taqwacore was so interesting to me because before I was Muslim, I was a goth girl hanging out with the punks. I shed that to be a devout Muslim, and while I love being a devout Muslim, it was really different to see people who didn't want to be strict yet they didn't want to leave Islam. They struggled with their inner selves and what faith means to them all the way to the end of the movie. I can now understand why Taqwacores changes so many people's lives. It is that final break-free moment for a lot of born-Muslims (I am a convert obviously), because honestly, what is more free than the idea of punk? It thrives on the self.

Also, I didn't expect the end at all.

I was like WOW. Did that really just happen?",1382313600,,722,4.18705035971223
4395881,4,B004K7M6U6,At first this was the only movie on Amazon I couldn't watch (Amazon's fault)....this is a review after watching. It was like freshman year of college all over again. Thank goodness we all grew up!,1369267200,,196,4.628571428571429
4395882,4,B004K7M6U6,"it was a great film. not the the messenger, or lion of the desert but a good film none the less. it gives you a chance to see what people who think out side the box think. not all Muslims are rocking thobes and reciting Quran warning you about chastisement . some just wanna live and worship allah. i recommended this film to several of my friends",1332374400,,347,4.1940298507462686
4395883,5,B004K7M6U6,"This film is the complete package.  It's a film that deals with relevant issues but in a very entertaining and sometimes humorous way.  The quality of the script and filmmaking itself are top-notch, and anyone who has knows a little about Islam & the punk ""scene"" would be sure to enjoy this film. Also, the character development is fantastic, the viewer can certainly expect to get to intimately know several of the film's key players.  Personally, my favorite character is Rabeya. A story centered around her might make an interesting book / screenplay!",1310515200,,555,4.946236559139785
4395884,5,B004K7M6U6,"This movie is phenomenal. It is very well made, form a technical standpoint. The visuals and the direction is amazing. And the story, based on the novel of the same name be Michael Muhammad Knight, pulls you in and reveals a side of Islam and modern Muslims that many wouldn't see today. Most of all it shows people like me, people who struggle, who wrestle, with Taqwa, with God consciousness. The film depicts a group of people struggling to define what Islam has to say to them today, how it can transform their lives. Islam has a lot to say to youth today, and it can be honest and honestly challenged. And when we confront those transformative moments, they can sometimes be messy and hard to watch, but transformation is change, and change is not always pretty.
Anyways, this film is incredible and speaks to those who don't take spoon-fed answers from tradition, no matter what religion, and who want to find the truth for themselves.
Allahu Akbar!
I would also STRONGLY recommend Mike Knight's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journey-to-the-End-of-Islam/dp/1593762461/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journey to the End of Islam</a>&nbsp;for a detailed exploration of what has become of The Taqwacores in real life, and more about facing Islam and asking tough questions. It's a beautiful work that I have read many, many times!",1302739200,,1373,5.361111111111111
4395885,5,B004K7M6U6,Saw the film in Los Angeles in October. Director Eyad Zahara captured the essence of the hardcore punk rock scene like few directors were able to do so before him. The acting is superb and the screen play is thought provoking and controversial. It challenges the audience on what it means to be a Muslim American and what it means to be a Muslim punk rocker trying to make sense of life as well as finding a non conflicting identity. The Riot Grrrl played by Nureen Dewulf was the most interesting character and her climactic final scene will not be forgotten. Highly recommended.,1302048000,2,580,4.640776699029126
4395886,5,B004K7M6U6,Every Muslim loves this movie. (Right? RIGHT?!) I also recommend it for non-Muslims who want to know what young American Muslims are *really* thinking. Been waiting for it to come out on DVD for months now.,1301961600,,206,4.75
4395887,5,B004K7M6U6,"Saw the film at The Asian Film Festival last year in San Diego, my life changed that day. It hit really close to home being Palestinian/Jordanian myself... who knew there was such a crowd of radical thinkers. Loved the film, deep thought went into it, left me thinking for months... seriously. Recommend to anyone who wants to expand their view of the arab culture, awesome work guys!",1300838400,6,384,4.746268656716418
4395888,5,B004K7M6U6,"I've just preordered my copy of the film and I am brimming with excitement as I wait for the fateful release date. Reading the book was like contacting a long lost brother, and watching the film is like finally seeing him with my own two eyes. Can't Wait.",1300665600,2,255,4.333333333333333
8432526,5,B004K7M6U6,"If you are a human being with an open mind you will watch and love this film. I read the book as well and they both are incredible. If you truly want to educate yourself on what people in subcultures endure, this is a great film to gain self-education.",1527897600,,252,4.163265306122449

8432531,5,B004K7M6U6,"I've been a punk fan for longer than I care to admit. (Due to revealing my age!) this shows that punk and the spirit behind this music is NOT dead or forgotten. This show gave me hope for the future. The future of punk, of course, but even better! Hope in humanity. Hope that freedom of speech will continue. Hope that maybe, just maybe, this country will eventually find its way without resorting to violence and succeeding in uniting all citizens with acceptance, tolerance, the REAL meaning of love. I guess you could say this had an impact on me ;) !",1412812800,,554,4.4411764705882355
8432532,4,B004K7M6U6,Extremely thought provoking on so many levels.,1410998400,,46,5.714285714285714
8432533,5,B004K7M6U6,"If you love Islam, if you love punk or if you are of any religion and love punk than this is a movie for you. It shows how everyone questions there faith, how some dream big dreams, and how some are just trying to sort things out. I believe everyone can relate to this movie. The acting is great, the locations are real which adds more depth and texture to the movie. Even if you never read the book you can watch this movie and know exactly what is going on.",1407024000,,459,4.054945054945055
8432534,5,B004K7M6U6,"i'm not muslim or, really anything but, i enjoy learning about different belief systems.  i thought this movie was a great blend of subcultures,  paradoxical aspects of living and, a struggle to evolve one's own belief system while still respecting what is held sacred.  great acting, funny as hell and great music.  seems like it would take some massive courage to make this movie.  very fascinating.  i've never seen anything like it.",1394841600,,436,4.986111111111111
8432535,5,B004K7M6U6,Interesting story that explores the conflict of Muslim faith as it impacts a variety of misfits searching for a message that unites them in their struggle with their prophet Mohammed.,1393027200,,183,5.133333333333334
