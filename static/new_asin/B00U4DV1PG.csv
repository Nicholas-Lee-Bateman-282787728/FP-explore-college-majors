8704437,4,B00U4DV1PG,"This movie had most of the elements I look for in a rewarding and watchable gay film. The acting was solid, cinematography and editing well done. Lots of believable, sensuous, non gratuitous erotic scenes. If you think it's about an overreaction to the loss of a house pet, or anything other than trust issues that inevitably arise in relationships, I wish you well in your future first marriage.",1514764800,3,396,4.838235294117647
8704438,4,B00U4DV1PG,An epic drama. How one beloved cat could make or break their relationship.,1510704000,,74,4.769230769230769
8704439,1,B00U4DV1PG,Odd. Entire movie based on an extreme over reaction. It wasn't the character getting therapy who needed mental health care. It was his emotionally fragile partner.,1509840000,,163,5.3076923076923075
