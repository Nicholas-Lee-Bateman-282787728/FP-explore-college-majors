898972,5,6304493053,"The cinematography and filming of the ""Incredible Journey"" is spectacular.  The remote Canadian scenery is wonderfully displayed and becomes the perfect setting for the three pets as they make their way across the country in search of their owners.

This first version is a classic, possessing a charm that the 90's release lacks.  The animals that Disney chose in 1963 are perfect in their roles, and it is easy to become immersed with their purpose.  Their adventures bind them together, and their love and loyalty are unquestionable.  It was a wise move to have only a narrator (rather than voices for each animal)... it forces the viewer to understand the animals on a much deeper level, deeper than any human words can interpret or express.

Today, people may find this movie slow-moving and boring.  However, I believe that this is because we are continually bombarded by split-second action in today's shows and fast-talking commercials... therefore, anything that tries to slow life down and make a person truly THINK for a bit just doesn't sink in for some people, sadly.

This movie is recommended for all ages.",1100217600,14,1121,4.989247311827957
898973,4,6304493053,"I was lucky enough to see this with my whole family when it was first released. I bought the VHS copy since the DVD is not available yet. I will give Disney a little credit though, they are finally starting to release some of their classic movies on DVD. I miss the days of Disney movies drawing the whole family to the theater for wholesome entertainment. It is rare that they do that in this age of dysfunctional families and kids with attitude to others. Somewhere along the line they got the idea that kids think this makes them look cool. Well the first time they get out on their own and they mouth off like that to the wrong person they find out how uncool that can be.

This movie is so far above the remake it makes you wonder how Disney's staff keep their jobs. If you want a movie you can let the whole family watch and enjoy together be sure to get this one. The scenery, acting, and the animals themselves are great. When I was a kid we got a Siamese and named him Tao because of this movie. The quality of this VHS is good. I look forward to the DVD release for better picture and sound and hopefully some extras. If you have seen the remake I'm sure you will be pleasantly surprised when you see this version. The remake tried to hard to be funny and it just isn't.",1089417600,28,1280,4.182186234817814
898974,2,6304493053,"I am a big Disney film fan, animated or live-action. But this film, 1963's ""The Incredible Journey"" just didn't cut it. During most of the film, there is almost no dialogue except for a boring narration of the story by Rex Allen. I liked the remake, 1993's ""Homeward Bound"", much better because it had human actors doing the voices of the animals. They gave the story a lot more spark, spice, action, and adventure, as well as a lot of humor. I believe that an adventure story with animals needs a lot of action and humor, especially in the case of ""The Incredible Journey"". Unfortunately, this 1963 Disney adventure has virtually no action or humor or even adventure; it's pretty much an extended version of Walt Disney's True-Life nature documentaries he made during the 1950's.",1072742400,3,780,4.785185185185185
898975,5,6304493053,"This earlier version of the movie is straightforward storytelling, without any rediculous attitude.  (I'm wagering that 90% of the reason the new Disney Movie, ""Treasure Planet"" failed is because of the absolutely  hideous haircut the lead character wears.)  Even my six year old loved this video.  The nature scenery is spectacular.  I hate the fact that the inferior updated version of this movie can be found on DVD but this classic version is only on video. Some of the people currently making the decisions at Disney ought to be replaced.",1039046400,60,543,4.988888888888889
898976,5,6304493053,A beautiful classical Disney's film.  Ideal for all ages.  A nice story  for children and for adults who like me din't lose contat with the child we  once were.  The scenery is oustanding.  The colours and the landscape are a  gift for the eyes.  The story deals with emotions and the close  relantionship between animal and between animals and humans.  The scenes  among the animals touched my heart deeply.  A must for bull terriers  lovers.,968284800,26,443,4.746666666666667
898977,5,6304493053,"If your kids get after you to rent that insipid ""funny-voiceover"" remake, just get them this classic and let them watch a REAL animal movie!
The animals are great, especially the cat,  who is no priss in this one but the hunter of the group--  she even takes  on a grizzly!  Add Rex Allen as the only needed voiceover and the result  is an almost perfect outdoor family film.  Unless they have been hopelessly  brainwashed by modern kiddie entertainment, your children will love it!

899129,5,6304493053,"This  one  movie  I  think  I'd  choose  over  (Homeward bound)  any  day.
&  is  one  of  my  all  time  favorite  movies.  I  think  I  like  the  Labrador  dog  the  best,  &  the  cat.  They  weren't  content  with  the  person  their  owners  had  left  them  with.  He  leaves  a  note  above  the  fireplace.  &  the  cat  accidentally  knocks  part  of  the  note  into  the  fire.  They  decide  to  begin  their  journey.
&  watch  out  for  each  other.  Mother  bear  misunderstands  the  situation  when  the  narrator  said  (Somebody  had  been  hurting  her  cubs  &  somebody  was  gonna  have  to  pay).  Cubs  were  more  mischievous  &  lost  interest  in  Bodger  &  decided  to rough  house  with  each  other.  The  interesting  thing  about  this  movie  is  the  cat  is  actually  a  male,  When  they  remade  this  movie  with  Michael J Fox  the  cat  was  a  female.  &  when  the  cat  get  washed  down  river,  he  temporarily  accepts  help  from  a  small  family,  then  must  leave  to  reunite  with  the  dogs.  All  these  animals  were  very  smart.  Knew  their  obstacles,  They  handled  themselves  rather  nicely.

Well, she got it and Charlie ruled our house for 16 years and let us live there as long as we behaved ourselves.  Truly a lovely story of the 3 animals that catches the heart and imagination.

899184,5,6304493053,"With the voice from Charlotte's Web soothingly narrating, this is a safe and satisfying family adventure film especially for those fond of pets.  If you are sensitive with animals and under 7 you might do well to miss the scene with the cat falling in the river.  The cat survives, is duly rescued by a kind family but looks very dead for a several minutes of the film and it was intense for our little ones.  Really like that the animals do not talk, a right reserved for God's crowning creation, mankind.  Instead the narrator gives voice to their thoughts and emotions and these 3 characters are developed so well.  We all really enjoyed this film after reading the book which worked well.  The friends protection and help to the bull terrier is intense, comical and full of tender animal love.  How they filmed a cat and lab reuniting playfully is remarkable!  Yes, it is 60's style and people acting a bit stiff and quirky but overall definitely 5 stars.",1482105600,5,959,4.6

My mind boggles at the work that went into training the three animals, and in making them feel so comfortable that they give Oscar-worthy performances.

899254,5,6304493053,"THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY is a delightful and heartwarming movie about three friends. It will appeal to the hearts of any animal lovers. It's truly a joy to watch and the warmth and beauty of this film will stay with you long after it is over.

Luath (a young Labrador retriever), Bodge (an aging bull terrier) and a feisty Siamese cat named Tao are the best of friends. They are staying temporarily with a kindly man while their family (mom, dad, sister and brother) are away from home. Despite being well-treated, Luath misses his human family and decides to travel the 200 miles back home. Neither senior Bodge nor Tao care to leave their comfortable new home but they can't leave Luath so all three embark on their incredible journey.

The movie is filmed so beautifully with lush colors and gorgeous scenery. The three animals are humanized with the best qualities of mankind--loyalty, love, compassion, patience and respect. Any of us, would be lucky to have a friend like one of these beautiful animals. Throughout the story a man with classic Disney narrator voice explains their journey. It doesn't seem like old Bodge will make it, but his pals stop to let him rest as needed and their journey continues. They survive by hunting a small animal or bird (maybe the only mildly distressing part of this upbeat film) and often it is the kindness of humans that helps them survive. It's especially sweet to see how Bodge and Tao have bonded. Then there are the two bear cubs that come to greet the trio and play but wait till Mama Bear shows up.

Here is deliciously delightful classic film that stands the test of time. It was filmed in 1963, so we know the three animal actors live on in this beautiful story. If you love animals, you won't resist the charm of THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY.  It's beautiful, well-written and full of joy. It's worth watching over and over especially when you need a bit of a ""lift"" from life's routine.",1467676800,9,1933,4.659824046920821

899317,5,6304493053,"Delightful movie! I remember watching it when I was very young, before the 1993 remake ""Homeward Bound"" was released (also a childhood favorite of mine). It's interesting to see what changed and what stayed the same in the remake. For one thing, this older film has a narrator rather than actors doing the ""voices"" of the animals--it's more a la ""Milo and Otis"" in that regard. The story of the family is very minimal, only a backdrop, and the focus is really on the animals. Different from the newer one, but equally charming in its own way. I really enjoyed watching it again!",1448582400,,578,4.621359223300971

899351,5,6304493053,"Outstanding DVD transfer....

There is much to commend about this dear little tear-jerker.......

  * Disney have done one of the best restorations/transfers from 35mm negative to std 576p DVD ever, easily out-performing scores of Blu-rays and HDs....

  * Given that the bulk of the film was shot out-of-doors  -  in some raw locations, with four-legged actors  -  makes the directing, lighting and camera work even more impressive. (There are of course a few scenes where this didn't occur)

*  The three pets were superbly coached, convincingly affectionate to one another, and pulling off some demanding scenes with endearing confidence

The box-blurb is truthful for once: ""Filmed against magnificent, colourful panoramas, this inspiring Disney animal adventure will lift your heart and spirit to a joyous new level"".

[This review refers to the PAL widescreen release]

PS. Disney could spend a but more time sprucing-up the box-sleeve.",1446336000,,942,5.393103448275862

The story of a Golden Labrador retriever, a Bull Terrier and a Siamese cat ,who leave their kindly sitter, when he takes a few hours on a hunting excursion, to return home. Setting off across the vast and oft inhospitable Canadian wilderness, surviving hunger, cold , exhaustion and many perils, and being sometimes assisted by some kindly humans in what was certainly a gentler , kinder age.
I must say I was struck by the irony of the fact that the animals could have waited a few days longer and would have been spared the hazardous journey and got home. but their ingenuity and valour offsets this. Tearjerking end and so uplifting and beautiful. I agree with the previous reviewer that the general narration is far superior to the modern technique of trying to put words into the mouths of the animals for comic effect.

The Incredible Journey is defenitly what I call a REAL family movie, not those awful talking animal movies these days where there's gross humor, name calling, pop culture refercences, and jaded, cynical characters. This movie proves that animals don't have to talk to be entertaing.

I also love Rex Allen as the Narrator! The warmth, wisdom, and the eloquence of his voice is just amazing. And he also narrated Charlotte's Web.

I'm defintely buying this movie. Bye for now!",1302825600,3,715,4.796747967479675
899950,5,6304493053,"As for the movie, five stars. I echo the sentiments of other reviewers who have already said this is the one to watch- it is true to the story, simple and heartwarming. Beautiful color photography, Rex Allen's narration, and the story are all I need- the cartoonish talking animal personalities of ""Homeward Bound- The Incredible Journey"" are an annoying distraction in that version of the movie. I feel that this 1963 version is a true classic in the family movie genre.

  As for Disney's marketing strategy with this property of theirs, ahem. It seems to me that Disney Corporation knows no shame when it comes to extracting  the maximum possible profit from everything they do- be it movies or the operation of their theme parks. In the case of movies, the way they release their titles for limited times only, in an effort to make them ""collectible"" and therefore sell for the highest possible prices, prevents this gem of a movie from being the entertainment bargain it should be. Now I'm all for free enterprise and support Disney's rights to run their business as they wish, but as a customer I am disappointed in Disney's apparent complete lack of regard for making their products affordable for me.

  I have an old VHS copy of this movie, but the quality was pretty rough and it was not in its original widescreen. How nice it would be to have a DVD available to see it in a higher quality format. If it was available on a DVD at a price point of around $10 or so, I would not hesitate to purchase a copy. But I refuse to pay $30 plus for a used copy, or wait some undefined period until Disney decides it is the right time to reissue it at who knows what price.

  Enter Amazon. When I found that the $1.99 download was available, I thought it was certainly worth a try. The Amazon Unbox download went smoothly and I had it installed on my laptop without issues. I purchased the $1.99 48-hour rental and let it  download to my laptop. We have the bottom of the line DSL service, which then is apportioned through our in-home wireless to the laptop, so the download was slow- took between 10 and 12 hours. After about 9 hours it said the movie was ready to play, but I chose to wait until the download was complete before trying it- I didn't want my viewing to be interrupted if that estimate that it could download the rest in time was off. But at last it was complete and I just had to push play.

  At first I thought ""What is wrong?""- The picture was saturated blobs of color. Then I discovered the brightness and contrast controls on the Unbox player. Slid the brightness to about halfway, and the contrast almost all the way to the left, and I had a very nice image. I'm not much for watching movies on a laptop: I usually hook the dvd player to my 5 year old Epson LCD projector when I really want to watch a movie. So in this case I hooked the S-video connection from the laptop to that of the projector and was quite satisfied with the result. The quality was perhaps  a small step below that of a good DVD, but way above my old VHS.
  So thank you Amazon! Thank you Disney! I really enjoyed it. And to Disney, if you want to put it out as a $10 DVD or a $20 Blueray, I bet you'd sell a ton of 'em, and make a lot of your customers very grateful!",1292976000,3,3266,4.319148936170213

900004,5,6304493053,"""The Incredible Journey"" is a wonderful book based on a true story of three animals surviving a long trek together against the odds.  It was made into a wonderful movie by Disney studios where the film is mostly narrated with some dialogue between the people involved.

Later another version was made where the animals ""talk"".  I've only seen clips of this version, and, maybe for some it is entertaining, but for me it takes away from the touching nature of this story.  By having the animals ""talk"", it makes it more of a charicature of the story and takes away from the seriousness of the plight of these animals.

I was hoping that the original would be put out on DVD eventually, and it was!  This is a timeless classic; a real family movie.  Of course, kids younger than six or so may not have the attention span for it - these Disney movies were never intended for toddlers; when they were made, movies were only seen in theaters and children under school age weren't taken to theaters.

Be prepared to have a hanky or two at the end...it's a very moving story, and extremely well photographed showing a lot of beautiful terrain.  It's definitely a movie I wanted to own so I can watch it again every few years.",1237161600,35,1218,4.5
900005,3,6304493053,"Disney knew how to appeal to us kids of the 50s - the 70s and this one is a classic example. He picked subjects that we identified with (animals & pets, parental decisions that didn't take the kids feelings into consideration, etc.)and gave them the storytelling that would make us feel good at the end. He did this over and over with his animation and kept it going when he got into live action film. You have to realize that in the 'old days' of live-action movie making, they didn't have all the digital special effects that we have today - so the animals needed to actually be trained (and extremely well trained at that!) and the crew had to work hard at making any confrontation scenes look realistic. The time spent on location doing multiple shots to get just the right combination of actions or animal expressions surely must have been extensive!

Watching this movie today it will seem tame and 'simple' compared to the computer-generated extravaganzas that we have come to expect (like Beverly Hills Chihuahua or Underdog)but I would resist using this film as a 'babysitting movie' to keep the kids occupied while you do something else. The heartfelt story and well-done scenes are something that warrant watching together and discussing later.",1236729600,12,1255,4.837209302325581

This is really great and wonderful movie clean throughout and heart-warming.  It is told from the animals perpective by a narrator.  The cat is the same one used in the original Disney ""THAT DARN CAT"" and the youngest boy appeared in several DIsney movies such as ""OLD YELLER"".  I highly suggest that in a world full of ridicule and debasement of morality, virtue and family unity & values, bathroom humour, sexual inuindos, social promiscuity and just plain pornography which passes in today's Hollywood (yes, sorry to say even at Walt Disney Studios) as good clean and wholesome entertainment any one purchase this film while you can.",1235520000,5,947,4.52046783625731

In the first place, the animals in this movie are the breeds and characters of the book.  With all due respect to the talents of M. J. Fox, D. Ameche and S. Struthers (the voices in the newer movie), one of the great joys of the original is that the only voice for most of the movie is Rex Allen's voice over.  The animals tell the story here, just as they do in the book, and they do it by their actions, not words.

The story unfolds as the author designed it to, letting the incredible scenery of Canada play its role.  The pets (Tao, Luath and Bodger) take off on their journey in search of the home they love and need and they walk, swim and fight their way every step of the way.  The ending of this movie is the only happy movie that has ever made me cry (and still does) because I once had the amazing joy of knowing the kind of love between human and pet, between friends, that's shown here.  But even if you haven't, track down this movie, sit back, and let the story unfold at its own wonderful pace.

Could be a little scary for very young children.  The bear didn't bother me as much as the cat in the river did.",1102291200,45,1242,4.1203319502074685
