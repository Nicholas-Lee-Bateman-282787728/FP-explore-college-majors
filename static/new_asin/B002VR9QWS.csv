8382384,4,B002VR9QWS,"I thought this would be more than it is. Marek Drewnoski's playing is excellent but what spoils this video is the camera shots away from the performer. We are subjected to a tour and views of the palace and its artifacts while the music is playing. A few surreptitious shots would have been acceptable but not the 75% coverage we are forced to endure. In particular, the camera takes us on a tour of all the clocks in the place while the 'Minute Waltz' is being played. Which I found extremely aggravating. But the filming and playing is good so I generously give it 4 stars.",1263859200,4,575,4.433962264150943
