Still, it's a better quality than the 2010 and 2011 versions, so that's why I rated it a 4.",1357344000,,269,4.2745098039215685

Excellent!!!!  A truly all American sport.  The respect and comradeship the contestants have for each other is to be commended....something not often seen in other professional sports.  If you enjoy the traditions of the old west, that turned a dare between ranch hands so many years ago into a highly entertaining spectator sport....this DVD is for you.
Then go find a real ranch to visit this summer or a rodeo to attend and enjoy first hand also. South Dakota is a good place to start.",1206576000,,720,6.5473684210526315
