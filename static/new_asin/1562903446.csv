One of the paintings, entitled A Carnival Evening, is familiar to me because it is found at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Meanwhile, Dropping in on Rousseau is really a waste of time.",1269043200,,356,4.492307692307692
7796349,5,1562903446,"My six year old LOVED this video.  A unique blend of art history, art appreciation and logical thinking.  Days later my child was able to recall details about paintings and the painter's life.  The method in which the information is presented enhances retention.  I plan to use all of the videos in this series.",1191456000,,311,4.703703703703703
7796350,5,1562903446,"I recently met the author of this video and learned how to use it in the classroom. ""Dropping in on Rousseau"" is beautifully written by an experienced teacher who knows how young children learn best. The video is animated by an artist whose work appeals to young audiences.

My advice is to try this video in your classroom. It is one that you and your students can watch again and again.

I also advise that you try the book, ""Dropping in on Rousseau.""",1092528000,,453,4.445783132530121
7796351,5,1562903446,"Dropping in on Rousseau is a pleasure to watch; I found it to be fun and informative. This playfully animated video does a great job showing the life of the painter, as well as giving insight into the creative inspiration for his masterworks. Best of all, it delivers a nice balance of light humor (in the excellent animated biographical interludes) with interesting commentary on Rousseau's paintings. As the art is examined by the entertaining animated cast (including Rousseau and his wife!), we learn new ways to observe and  think about the work. This tape is a perfect way to introduce children to the life and career of  Rousseau and to appreciate the artistic process.",1045180800,,676,4.921052631578948
