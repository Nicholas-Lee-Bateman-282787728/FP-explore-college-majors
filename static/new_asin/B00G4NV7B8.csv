6056865,4,B00G4NV7B8,"I'm rating it four stars because I can remember these and for me they were the best thing on TV. I am so pleased the have been released, even if only in America (I am a Brit). The only thing I would criticize is the price and that is why it hasn't got five stars. I mean I might be tempted if it was all thirty, but this seems extortionate! I don't know what the exchange rate from dollars to British pounds is but I wouldn't pay anything above 20 - 30 for this set. Maybe when it comes out across the pond (in Britain) it'll be a more reasonable price!",1383868800,17,553,3.990990990990991

6056867,1,B00G4NV7B8,"Ridiculously overpriced currently at $53.09 for only 6 movies for a total of 571 minutes long, which could mean that two movies are put on each disc for a total of only 3 discs in this ""collection"". This could be compared to Perry Mason Season 1 Volume 1, which is usually priced around $15 for 5 discs and is about 1,000 minutes long.  I would also like to point out that their are 30 movies total, which means their will be 5 ""collections"" total, and an over $300 price for all of them at this current price! On a recent deal of the week Amazon had the complete series for $248.99 on 72 discs.",1383609600,96,595,4.219298245614035

6056874,5,B00G4NV7B8,"I love this collection and was glad to see it come out.  I especially like that William Katt plays Paul Drake, Jr. who is a PI like is father and does all the dirty work needed for each case but he will not break the law to get the information he needs, he just uses his charm and good looks to get the information he needs.  Also in the first movie the viewer learns that Perry Mason quit being a lawyer and became an Appellate Court judge but then resigns when the secretary who worked for him when he was a lawyer is framed for murder so that he can defend her and prove that she did not kill anyone and would not be capable of doing it.",1436313600,2,640,3.9921875

6056885,5,B00G4NV7B8,"I was very surprised when they came out with a TV movie version of the Perry Mason series. Some of the characters were different especially when Paul Drake was replaced with Paul Drake Jr. The young actor was good but in my opinion he couldn't touch the original, William Hopper.

I believe that William Katt, who played Paul Drake Jr. was Barbara Hale's son.

But, I still enjoy watching the movie versions.",1409616000,2,408,4.652777777777778

6056887,2,B00G4NV7B8,"Too expensive for what you get.
The quality of the video is a bit grainy - not very sharp. The colors are a tad washed out. Looks like a recording off the air. 4:3 aspect.

You get 3 DVDs for 6 episodes:
disk 1:
perry mason returns
the case of the notorious nun
disk 2:
the case of the shooting star
the case of the lost love
disk 3:
the case of the sinister spirit
the case of the murdered madam

Mannix, Magnum PI, and Columbo have better quality video as an example.

I'll wait for re-mastered version before I shell out for anymore of these movies.",1406764800,7,552,4.140186915887851

6056891,5,B00G4NV7B8,"I know I'm not the only one who has waited and waited for the 2-hour Perry Mason movies on DVD, but I must be one of the happiest!  The old black and white episodes are great, but the 2-hour movies are by far superior!  Raymond Burr is more mature and even sexier with the silver of the more experienced actors.  The 2-hour movies give the audience more time to put the puzzle pieces together as they follow Della, Paul or Ken, and Perry to end of the case.  The guest stars in each movie were excellent additions to the plot!  These DVD collections are worth every penny.  Perry Mason fans will be in heaven!!!",1402012800,,611,4.315789473684211

6056893,4,B00G4NV7B8,i would write a great review if it was not for the fact that it says on the cover there are 2 movies however I could only access one movie from each DVD. I feel a bit ripped off with this one.,1398556800,,192,3.5952380952380953
6056894,5,B00G4NV7B8,"I have been waiting for what seems like half my life for them to come out with these movies.  They are the BEST on TV - but you are pricing them out of my range.  I'm 71.  I doubt you will get them to a price I can afford before I die.  Also, you don't list which movies are in the set.  I would much prefer to buy them one or two at a time at a price I can afford, and there are some movies I want very badly, and some I could live without.  You're probably too late for me but these are some of the best made-for-tv movies ever and people should have the chance to buy them if they want to.  There's about 10 I would love to own but when you live on Social Security only you don't buy movies at these prices, and you don't buy sets if you don't know what's in them.  Glad someone finally saw the light, though.  Raymond Burr, especially in his later years, was one of the greatest talents whoever lived.  It's about time more people will get to see that.",1398384000,2,956,3.9322916666666665

6056900,5,B00G4NV7B8,i love perry mason and have the complete collection.  I think Raymond Burr was one of the best actors ever and embodied the character so well. I gave it 5 stars,1395619200,,160,4.161290322580645
6056901,5,B00G4NV7B8,"Once again Perry is here with these 90 minute movies from the 80s. Kindof expensive but as always very good stories, acting is superb, with casts of well known actors from the 80s. It's great to see Perry, Della and a plus is Paul's son is played by William Katt. I'm real happy to learn they will be coming out with more of these.",1394755200,,331,4.1875

6056903,4,B00G4NV7B8,I loved this set when it first came out and bit the bullet and paid $50.97 for the six movies.  If you haven't already.... WAIT!!  On June 10th these six movies are being broken up into three sets that Amazon is now taking pre-orders for $11.89 each (discounted from the $16.99 retail price). You will save $15.30 doing this instead of buying this set!!,1394582400,31,353,4.5

6056906,5,B00G4NV7B8,"These 6 movies are welcome additions to my Perry Mason collection.  Yes, the whole series is predictable...but what's wrong with predictable.  I love the Perry Mason Mysteries and enjoy watching the uncut versions.  It's interesting that Raymond Burr became Perry Mason and Perry Mason became Raymond Burr...or something like that.",1394064000,,331,5.58
6056907,5,B00G4NV7B8,"Each of the Perry Mason movies on this dvd are superb.  The acting is superb and the movies are well written. The shows are full of surprising twists, and are very exciting.",1393200000,,173,4.40625
6056908,5,B00G4NV7B8,Just like the young Perry Mason - love the movies!  Have been waiting for these to come out on DVD,1393200000,,98,3.9
6056909,5,B00G4NV7B8,Perry Mason fans waited a long time for the entire TV series to be released. Those that bought it in increments probably paid a fortune for it. And now they're releasing the TV movies in the same manner. That's the only downside to trying to own a collection. I gave it 5 stars because the DVD quality is fine and I've waited too long to view the shows without the cuts that TV networks make to get in their commercial time. Can't wait for more TV movies to be released - just give us more than six for the high price! Please!,1393200000,,526,4.166666666666667
6056910,5,B00G4NV7B8,"As a avid Perry Mason fan I've waited longingly for the made-for-TV movies to come out on DVD.  My VHS cassettes were taped on a faulty machine.  I've read most of the Erle Stanley Gardner series of books and saw a hint here and there of romantic innuendo between Perry and Della.  They writers of the movies did the same thing, particularly in ""The Case of the Lost Love"" and ""The Case of the Murdered Madam"".  For a fan of Perry and Della you'll want to start your collection of the DVD made-for-TV movies right here.
And now....the defense rests.",1392595200,,549,4.46
6056911,5,B00G4NV7B8,These Perry Mason movies were great. I thoroughly enjoy them. I can't wait for the other Perry Mason movies to come out.,1392508800,,120,4.5

6056913,5,B00G4NV7B8,"I am a big fan of the newer movies and hope to see more of his releases. It was a little pricy, but I think it was well worth the price.

6056914,5,B00G4NV7B8,I own all of the earlier Perry Masons and finally completed viewing all of them which I ordered from Amazon over the past several years. I was more than pleased that volume 1 of the Perry Mason movies was finally available. The quality of the movies were professionally done and I can appreciate the color of the volume considering the black and white earlier Perry Masons. I believe that the cost of volume 1 was a bit high but I wanted to own it nonetheless. I miss some of the earlier actors who are no longer with us but thankfully the original secretary was in it. Very happy with this purchase.,1391904000,,600,4.414414414414415

6056920,1,B00G4NV7B8,"While ""Perry Mason"" remains one of the great TV legal dramas of the Golden Age, the studio (Paramount) that released this set has no shame at pricing this collection well over $53.00 for this  3 disk, 6 movie collection! For that it deserves ONE star or less! Note: This is ""Collection 1"" (so labeled) --and there are 30 ""Perry Mason"" TV movies. At this ratio, the 30 movies will be released in 5 sets of 6 movies each and cost well over $300.00 or more!! Let us look at some even better known and wide-followed other TV movie series. In comparison, the ""Columbo"" 1989 Movie collection cost $11.50 for a 2 disk, 4 movie collection; the ""Columbo"" Movie collection of 1990 of 6 movies on 3 disks is $12.00; and the ""Columbo"" Movie collection, 1994-2000 -- again is 6 movie grouping on 3 disks cost only $18.21. Finally, the ""Murder She Wrote"" Movie collection (4 movies on 2 disks) cost $20.00. In case Hollywood in general and Paramount in particular hasn't noticed there is a on-going recession going on in this country. Discretionary funds for such luxuries as DVD sets, go to the bottom of the list. Just because fans have a loyalty to a program doesnt mean they are stupid. Raising prices out of all proportion to earlier sets or similar sets is just greed. Suggestion: Let market forces do their workdont purchase until the prices come down appreciably.",1390348800,9,1357,4.654166666666667
6056921,5,B00G4NV7B8,"I thought this set of movies was the most reminicent of the original series. From the opening scene of the courtroom  to the closing credits, one gets the feeling of the original tv series.  Each movie was suspenseful and intriguing. My only problem was the price. It's rather high. As a fan, you will have to decide for yourself if the cost is justified. However, these movies are good.",1390348800,33,387,4.594202898550725
6056922,5,B00G4NV7B8,I am a hugh fan of the Raymond Burr Perry Mason TV series. I am glad they have released the first series. I hope they release all his TV movies in the future. The price was a little high.,1390262400,6,187,3.8205128205128207
6056923,4,B00G4NV7B8,"I love watching Perry Mason so I am very happy to own this collection.  I am disappointed in the quality of the film.  The original Perry Mason series, which I also have, has better viewing quality than much of this collection.  However, that doesn't mean it is not worth buying!  We had a Perry Mason ""marathon"" last weekend and really enjoyed watching these DVDs.  I will be watching these DVDs over and over again.",1389744000,2,417,4.581081081081081
6056924,4,B00G4NV7B8,"Had it not been for the unreasonably high price, I would have given this set of Perry Mason movies 5 stars.  Being a fan, I had to have this set........but it's priced about $20.00 too high.  The six movie set contains the first six Perry Mason made for TV movies that aired on NBC starting in 1985.  After nine years on the air and a nineteen year hiatus...""Perry Mason Returns"" was a ratings blockbuster and led to 25 more TV movies which ran from 1985 to 1993 and Raymond Burr's death.  But he is immortalized in the role of Perry Mason and viewers confirmed as much. After watching Perry Mason in black and white for nine years and 270 episodes (one episode was filmed in color in 1965), it was nice to watch our hero in glorious color and lavishly photographed.

Hopefully another set will be out soon at a more reasonable price.",1389312000,4,834,4.42483660130719

6056926,3,B00G4NV7B8,"I love Perry  Mason so  I purchased this set even if the warnings were there about being overpriced.
The quality is ok .  All I can say is you really have to be a  die hard fan .  The set came with three separate dvd's but only 2 movies on each.  The price needs to more reasonable!  It was great to see Perry and Della again!!!",1388966400,42,328,3.878787878787879
6056927,5,B00G4NV7B8,"I would agree with an earlier review.  If you don't want to buy the item now, then why give low-star reviews?  It's really no different than the model set by HBO video, which inspired other manufacturers to charge you twice for an entire season.....which most of us gladly payed for the original series.  Some of these titles have been available from the Movieplex on-demand service through cable providers (where I first viewed them....all with streaming glitches, mind you.)  I'm confident that my purchase will help to ensure future volumes, and frankly could care less about the cost.  If only more people would buy Ironside, I could look forward to completing that series as well.",1388707200,2,685,4.973684210526316
6056928,5,B00G4NV7B8,"While the price may be a wee bit high, the price is worth every penny of it.  I love Perry Mason, even have Raymond Burr's autograph along with Barbara Hale.  I have every book of Perry Mason that Earle Stanley Gardner wrote.  Each case is unique with its twists and turns.  Remember these are two hr movies not the normal 1 hr show.  So if the price is a little high wait till it comes down in about 2 or 3 years if it ever does.  For true Perry Mason fans price shouldn't matter.  Can't wait for Amazon to release volume 2.  The only complaint is that one five minute seen from Perry Mason returns is missing.  That is in the very beginning where Perry Mason appears as a appelate court judge and he finds out Della has been arrested for murder then he steps down, but hardly noticable. Overall all 6 movies are awesome.",1388620800,5,822,4.251612903225807
6056929,5,B00G4NV7B8,As a long time Perry Mason fan I am so glad these movies are finally coming out on DVD. They will be a nice addition to my Perry Mason DVD collection.

6056932,5,B00G4NV7B8,Why is everyone so focus on the price. If you all knew anything about TV shows or movies coming out would know that they are priced high at first. When the date of release nears the price always drops. Also if you order at the higher price and it drops by the time you get it amazon always charges you the lower price.

I hope the 'Perry Mason Returns' with Hal Holbrook are also released.  THe DVD's may be pricy but I am willing to pay more for quality programming.",1387238400,18,304,4.592592592592593
6056934,5,B00G4NV7B8,The material is great but the price is way out of line.  I have the full colletion of Classic Perry Mason and normally I order rather quickly when a new Perry Mason collection comes out ... but not this time.  40 % less would be about right !,1386460800,5,242,4.020833333333333
6056935,1,B00G4NV7B8,"The one star rating is for the price. We should remember these were shown on tv FREE.  If there are still dvd recorders to tape shows off tv, then spend the same money once and record them and more.  Also these shows are shown on Hallmark Movie channel.",1386374400,7,253,4.25
6056936,5,B00G4NV7B8,"As for the TV Series and Movies of Perry Mason, even though I haven't see all of the Movies, I love the TV Series Perry Mason, BUT as for the Price, I would have to say that the Company that's putting this Out should be Arrested for Robbery / Theft for the reason because in my own Opinion, I would have to say in my own Opinion that the Charge of $53.09 is Outrageous.  I believe that this Movie Collection Should be going for Approximately, Approximately $25.00 to $30.00 and NO More.
  In NO WAY do I go blaming Amazon.com for this, they have Noting to do with this, it's the Company that's putting this out is the problem;  Don't those Edits realize that the times that were living in is Very Very BAD?  Jobs are tough enough to get, BUT, Money is even Tighter, just what does this Releasing Company think were living in, the Financial Times of the 1960's and Early 1970's?
  What this Releasing Company Needs to do is get with the times, and Come Out of the Stone Age; just what do they think people are made of, Money?  What is there problem?",1385078400,4,1048,4.284263959390863
6056937,5,B00G4NV7B8,"The 5 stars are for the movies not the price. I got it at 41.00 when it first went on sale and even that was high but these companies have to stop with this nonsense. 6 Movies should be no more than 20 bucks ...When Mill Creek releases series you get them for 10 bucks..10 bucks!!!!!!!
They are releasing Charlies Angels and Highway to Heaven for under 10 bucks a season!!  Why so high for others like this one?? don't these companies realize how bad things are. Then they don't sell well and they stop releasing the remaining seasons or in this case the remaining movies. How the heck can people pay these outlandish prices?  You should get the entire movies series for 53.00 .......come on they have been aired on TV so many times. I have them on DVR but since I have the whole series I want to have these in original form also..WAKE UP AND STOP ROBBING CONSUMERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1383868800,56,879,4.453416149068323
8620634,4,B00G4NV7B8,"I really like Raymond Burr and the old Perry Mason TV show. I never really watched the movies when they were on television because he had a beard, gained a lot of weight, etc. It just didn't seem like the old Perry Mason.  Since I'm older now I thought I'd give the movies a try. I enjoyed them, but they weren't as well done as the iconic television show.  They're still good, enjoyable, but watching them once was enough.",1504742400,,423,4.341772151898734
