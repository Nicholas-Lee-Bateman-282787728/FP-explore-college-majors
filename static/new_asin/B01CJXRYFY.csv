7684791,2,B01CJXRYFY,It's clear to the viewer from the start this is a low-budget-feature film. The lab looks like it was in a home basement with parts from a surplus store. The movie seemed  to be made as a film-school thesis. If one was rating it as that it deserves a good grade and director deserves credit for that. Overall impression as a feature film this is a bad move to watch. It feels like someone's trying to make a fast buck at the viewers expense.,1468022400,2,440,4.238095238095238

7684794,4,B01CJXRYFY,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Movies that deal with the subject of time travel are always interesting for me.  I greatly enjoy seeing the different ideas that filmmakers have in regard to solving the paradox issues and whatnot.  Not to mention, the special effects can be (and many times are) very cool.  SYNCHRONICITY, a recent offering from Magnet Releasing, is a slick science fiction thriller that uses time travel as its base premise.  And while its not perfect, its a heck of a lot of fun, and its a film I suggest giving a look.

I read online this film was a micro-budget production, but I never learned what the actual budget was.  Even so, the production team did a great job with the money at hand.  It is not an effects-filled extravaganza, but those used look great and enhance the progression of the story.

SYNCHRONICITY is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The acting is very good, with Chad McKnight portraying the lead character, Jim.  McKnight reminds me of a young Jeffrey Combs for some reason, which is definitely a compliment.  He is joined by actress Brianne Davis, who does a great job as Jims love interest, Abby.  The rest of the cast compliments them, particularly screen vet Michael Ironside who can portray a villain like nobody else.

As mentioned, the special effects are good, although theres not too many of them.  I love the wormhole generating machine, as it looks very convincing.  The auras Jim sees during his blackouts are curious, and I wonder if they are images of some natural phenomenon.

The story is where the film has a couple of down-points.  In addition to being a science fiction thriller, it is also a love story.  This aspect works for the most part, however the plotline does have a couple of flaws.  Granted, time travel is a tricky subject, and its not always easy to explain.  But SYNCHRONICITY at least triesunfortunately, the explanation is not exactly coherent.  Theres a lot of insinuation involved, and the conclusion is not quite so conclusive.  In the end, I had to make a couple of assumptions and then do some Internet digging to see if they were correct.  (Interestingly, my assumptions were wrong, if what I read is accurate).

Still, I cannot deny SYNCHRONICITY is entertaining and certainly worth the watch.  Director Jacob Gentry appears to have a bright future ahead, and I can say with the utmost certainty that I cannot wait to see what he does next.  In the meantime, check out this fairly clever jaunt into the wormholeits an interesting ride.",1464220800,2,2564,4.742081447963801
7684795,5,B01CJXRYFY,So many twists.  Wormholes can cause so many problems.,1463702400,,54,5.0
7684796,2,B01CJXRYFY,"Stiff, awkward. Difficult to enjoy. The premise is interesting... but it struggles to be more than a premise. There are hints that BIG THINGS ARE HAPPENING but the answers only lead to more questions [such is the way of time travel]. The challenge to watching it again - which would probably add comprehension - is that we struggle to care about the characters - and I don't know about you, but if I don't identify with SOMEONE, the story didn't connect... I wonder, if we grant the basic idea [no spoiler here - if you want to know it, watch it ... lol, *I* did :)] well, I wonder but at the end of the day, I didn't care.",1463443200,2,623,4.243697478991597

7684809,4,B01CJXRYFY,I didn't know anything about this movie going into it. just knew it was a cheap scifi flick. As soon as the movie started I was hooked. The first half of the movie is a S L O W burn but then everything starts to fall into place and its good. Im happy to add this movie to my scifi collection.,1489968000,,292,3.80327868852459
7684810,5,B01CJXRYFY,"It must be difficult to be any kind of artist in a culture such as the one we all live in today.  Any critical thought about the art in question can be recorded for all to see and can unfortunately cast a dim hope that someone with no knowledge of the film will even give it a chance.  Everyone has their opinion about everything that can have an opinion and concerning art judgements are like bullets in that they tend to come from everywhere.

The movie is about a scientist who is partially self-funding a series of experiments to discover the secret to time-travel.  It's in this expedition that he discovers that what he was hoping to accomplish may not have been what got and the effort to unravel the temporal knots (consequences) is not easily done .

The film has a great deal to offer.  It's not an action set piece.  It's not a heart-shaped romance.  It's science fiction the way it should be which is...different. The movie has style and dare I say some sophistication and you can tell within the first few minutes that some money and effort was invested to give the film a sort of shine and class.  The story here though is king as the depth of it all can take some mental aerobics to figure out.  Synchronicity is definitely a multiple viewing experience as it has so many ideas that one time to get it all figured out is just not enough.

I can see how this kind of movie is not for everyone but it was for myself and I hope this review will help spare someone who will not like it an unhappy, lost 2 hours and guide someone else to an exciting experience.",1484352000,9,1571,4.32764505119454
7684811,5,B01CJXRYFY,Great thought provoking movie. A film to be seen over and over again (in each parallel world of course).,1483833600,,104,4.526315789473684
7684812,1,B01CJXRYFY,I did not like this movie at all. It was quite boring.,1472083200,,54,3.5833333333333335
7684813,1,B01CJXRYFY,"This movie was so poorly written, acted, and produced that we were unable to even watch until the end. Very disappointing.",1471910400,,122,4.857142857142857
7684814,5,B01CJXRYFY,"Occasionally confusing but mentally challenging low-budget film. I might be biased in favor of this film since I not only like time travel films but write my own time travel e-book novels (available here on Amazon).

The girl is quite a dish (as Michael Ironside says in a cruder tone) and seems to be both fickle and loving -- depending on your POV, which is what this film is about. Which version of the time-traveler's experiences do we trust? What should HE trust?

I couldn't help but be reminded of the film and TV series THE TWELVE MONKEYS, particularly the series which stretches out the concept as introduced in the Terry Gilliam film. Jumping around must certainly play havoc with one's mind as well as one's physical body, as Aaron Stanford discovers in the series.

The ending of SYNCHRONICITY does seem ambiguous, but if we can put a trust in a smile, we can afford to be optimistic.

If you like comic-book heroes (and simplicity) you should skip this one. If you have a brain and like to be challenged, give this a try. As another reviewer wrote, this is certainly better than much of the drek coming out of Mogul-land.",1471219200,,1134,4.626865671641791
7684815,4,B01CJXRYFY,The movie was not a 5; it was closer to a 3.5 or 3.75. But it beat the snot out of most stuff coming out of Hollywood now a days.,1469750400,,129,3.3333333333333335

8753342,2,B01CJXRYFY,"A rather boring and rather pointless science fiction movie. I like science fiction movies and thought this one was going to be good. Time travel and a corporate villain sound like cliche time travel elements, but, I thought it could still be good, after all it did have Michael Ironside as the bad guy. But, it had all the hallmarks of a low budget, low imagination throwaway movie. Right off the bat, there was little of the movie about the time travel machine and development. The overwhelming majority of the focus was on the inventor's infatuation with the villain's mistress. In other words, less science fiction focus, and more focus of teenage type infatuation by the hero. That killed it for me. The time travel device start up and worm hole opening scenes were cheap, boring, and low budget effects.

The plot where the hero uses the time travel device for his own personal gain seem to be a total waste of time and he doesn't actually do anything to take advantage of his time travel. He travels in time (or maybe he doesn't) and yet he just lets everything play out as it did before without doing anything to alter the timeline. Things just pass him by and he does nothing, except, wastes his new time. Nothing seems to happen with the corporate villain and he seems to be nothing more than a prop for the hero to get all angsty about, yet does nothing about it. The movie went nowhere and had an ending that makes you just say ""what the heck was that and why did I waste my time watching it?""",1532995200,,1504,4.469090909090909
8753343,3,B01CJXRYFY,"I really wanted to give this one a better rating... but all the promise that is built up through the first two-thirds is squandered by the ending. If this had taken the darker 70s nihilistic turn at the end that every ounce of it pointed at then it would be a solid five-star classic, but it didn't, so it's not. Still well worth watching if you're an SF fan looking to expand your collection.",1531526400,,393,4.324324324324325
8753344,5,B01CJXRYFY,"Give this low budget film a chance. Science fiction without the ""boom"" factor, for the thinking audience. Great production value despite the lower budget. High on style and concept. Plus it has Michael Ironside in a supporting role.",1531267200,,232,5.131578947368421

8753346,2,B01CJXRYFY,"...and not the kind that needs explosions and CGI for everything. Rather, I come from the sci-fi of the 1970s when the genre was at its storytelling best.

Synchronicity has so much potential, but sadly falls into a scriptwriting trap that is all too common anymore. Every line delivered is laced with false dichotomy - ""We have to get this right or the universe will cease to exist!"" Well, Carl Sagan once quipped that ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" and so lines like these need some sort of explanation, which the film never really delivers. And there are a lot of false dilemmas and dichotomies throughout the film, to the point that it was unwatchable, but I stuck through it, hoping it would ameliorate. It never did.

The characters are also one dimensional and vapid. I felt nothing for them. It seemed that the attempt at mystery was too gratuitous.

Lastly, the story is ""science fiction"" in virtually everything - even down to the number of weeks our protagonist was been awake and actively drinking coffee (I looked it up, and sure enough, he broke all known records for length of time without sleep). Honestly, the story propels itself forward better if the science fiction aspect is left to the mechanics within the story that require a level of ""suspended disbelief."" We did not need science fiction for something as seemingly unimportant to the story as the length of time someone has gone without sleep. We do need science fiction to help us accept the concepts underlying the machine they've built, but that's about it. They should have let the story propel us the rest of the way... The paradox of great science fiction storytelling is that the ""science fiction"" is minimized and only tapped when absolutely necessary, and not blown out of proportion at every turn.

Not a good film if you like classic sci-fi.",1524700800,,1852,4.85126582278481
8753347,2,B01CJXRYFY,"Despite being convoluted, the story is thin. The acting is mediocre. The cinematography makes home movies look good (though the composition of the shots is generally well done).
