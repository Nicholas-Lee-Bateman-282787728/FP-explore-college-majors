8415233,1,B0043RSS32,"I bought this DVD thinking I would see how different techniques of cooking in the kitchen of a restaurant were used to produce different meals. Instead almost everything is baked and the only cooking ideas I got were to use different spices to add flavor to various meals. The meals are not diverse enough. They are the ones provided on a menu in a restaurant in California. I would rather see how different vegetables are prepared, cooked, and how different meals can be put together using various techniques like roasting, sauteeing, etc. Just to be stimulated to use various species is of minor use to me. I expected more.",1312502400,,625,4.743119266055046

Now i have the DVD and I cook all the time, for my parents, and myself. My first conquest was Mushrooms Jerez(sherry)it was so flavorful and amazing. Guess whose cooking for thanksgiving, i am :)",1290038400,,372,4.253521126760563
8415235,5,B0043RSS32,"Have you ever gone to a favorite restaurant and wished you could replicate your favorite dishes at home? The Black Sheep Bistro's video makes it possible.  It gives you the opportunity to see exactly how to make the recipes work in a way that standard cookbooks can't.  I am a visual learner so I was so excited to hear about a VIDEO cookbook of my favorites from a local restaurant. There are many different dishes to suit any occasion and season. It was cool, after eating at the Bistro for years, to get a peek inside Chef Rick's kitchen. Great paella and lamb recipes!",1287705600,2,572,4.490384615384615
8415236,5,B0043RSS32,"Just watched the Black Sheep's DVD and are so impressed! My wife and I are relatively new foodies, and watching Chef Rick create these amazing dishes in a way that was completely unintimidating was great for us...we are making plans right now to try out the paella! The video element to this project is key, as reading a cookbook and looking at pictures is just not the same. We love to entertain, and these recipes will definitely serve us well in that arena. Easy to navigate, intuitive set-up of the menu, and this will be a much-used reference in our household kitchen! A huge recommendation for newbies like us, and seasoned chefs alike...happy cooking!",1286668800,,658,4.780701754385965

After eating at the Blacksheep for years we can make what we like at home!!  This CD will only enhance your desire for cooking at home.",1286323200,,388,4.1066666666666665
8415238,5,B0043RSS32,Chef Rick does an amazing job demonstrating how to make his famous Mediterranean dishes. His unique approach is so fun and reduces the intimidation factor to zero. This cooking DVD is better than any cook book or cooking show I have ever experienced. A must have for any cooking enthusiast.,1286150400,,290,4.82
