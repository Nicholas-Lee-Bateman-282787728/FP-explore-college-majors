2334677,4,B0009XRZBK,"The DVD begins with a 2 minute introduction to general weight loss guidelines, including amount of food taken in, sufficient exercise, and the benefits of pilates.

The workout itself is set off the shore of an ocean border with waves splashing on the rocks. The scenery is beautiful and inviting. The music is typical Gaiam relaxation music. There is nothing overly special nor offensive about it, although the beginning segment includes a nice drum beat in the background.

Ana begins the workout in standing pilates stance, then lowers down with arms crossed in front. The following is the list of exercise series included in the workout.

* The hundred

* Roll-up (5)

* Single Leg Circles (5 each direction, each leg)

* Rolling like a ball (5)

* Single leg stretch ( 5 slow)

* Double straight leg stretch (2 modified with arms and legs straight up, 3 normal)

* Spine stretch forward (5)

* Open leg rocker preparation (alternate leg extensions while balancing-2, follow both legs extended and balance)

* Cork screw (3 each side)

* Saw (3 each side)

* Neck roll ( 2 sets)

* Swan dive prep (5)

* Child's pose stretch (2 breaths)

* Single leg kick (5)

* Double leg kick (4 sets of 3 kicks)

* Child's Pose Stretch (3 breaths)

* Shoulder bridge prep (5)

* Side kick series (right side):

  Up & Down (5)

  Circles (8 each direction)

  Bicycle (3 forward, 3 reverse)

* Side kick series (left side)

* One leg teaser (1 leg planted, 1 leg extended diagonally-3 each side)

* Hip circles (2 each side)

* Seal

* Stand without the aid of hands

This workout is low to mid-intermediate. The pace moves a bit slower than typical Cab&aacute;n workouts. At first I was irritated by this, as I was used to Ana's previous speed, but I soon realized that I was able to focus better and feel the exercises more deeply at this speed. Although it is not my favorite of Cab&aacute;n's work, I am happy I made this purchase, and plan to rotate it into my collection.

The instruction is impeccable, probably some of the best, detailed guiding that Ana has even done. It is performed in voice over format. As usual, Ana's form is excellent and inspiring. Ana uses a calm, yet motivating voice, and is very easy to follow. Her manner of speaking is not at all offensive, and it is easy to ""bond"" with her as an instructor.

Pilates for Weight Loss: Motivational Audio Program CD

Narrated by Ana Cab&aacute;n

This audio CD is an accompaniment to the Pilates for Weight Loss: 30 Minute Quick Start DVD workout. Along with the DVD and CD kit is an access code for more specific dietary and exercise recommendations on a Gaiam web site for weight loss.

The CD has 6 tracks. The first 5 range around 1 minute long.

Track 1 focuses on staying on track with weight loss goals, by giving general recommendations about food intake and exercise.

Track 2 gives general recommendations for healthier eating and the benefits of doing so. Ana even reveals that she herself was beginning to combat weight gain until she started following some of these recommendations.

Track 3 suggests keeping a journal. The journal can record food eaten for the day, helping to create a sense of moderation. Or the journal can be of thoughts, such as lists of activities you have planned or even just how you are feeling.

Track 4 gives specific examples of what topics can be written in a journal. Some suggestions are current thoughts in the head, which exercises you enjoy, focus on daily fitness, or accomplishments.

Track 5 lists ideas of activities that will be beneficial to practice daily. For example, you should take time for yourself, focus on small steps, exercise, expect disappointment at times, think of 3 things you are grateful for, and drink 8 glasses of water.

Track 6 contains the actual audio workout. It is perfect for traveling as it is a mini-version of the workout on DVD.

The first 2 minutes discusses Joseph Pilates's belief on the purpose and effects of pilates.

The next 4 minutes include warm up stretches. This part would be good if doing no other workout before hand, or if relaxing at the end of the day, but it can be skipped if you prefer to go directly to the actual mat work, especially if you had done cardio first, for example.

Stretches while lying on the back:

* Pull knees into the chest, one at a time, with slow, synchronoized breathing. (2)

* Rib cage stretch: lift arms straight up above then pull over-head (5)

* Single leg hamstring stretch

* Lying back twist

* Breathing and relaxing with knees bent, feet on floor

The next 11 minutes begin the actual mat work. The workout is nearly identical to its DVD counterpart, using the same music and most of the same exercises; however, extra attention to description has been given to enhance the ability to follow along with the audio format.

The following exercise series is included:

* The hundred

* Roll-up (5)

* Single Leg Circles (5 each direction, each leg)

* Rolling like a ball (5)

* Single leg stretch ( 5 slow)

* Double straight leg stretch (2 modified with arms and legs straight up, 3 normal)

* Spine stretch forward (5)

* Saw (3 each side)

* Breathing and relaxing with knees bent and feet on the floor while lying on the back

The remaining 8 minutes or so continues with the relaxation music used in the DVD format.

I think the CD is a good reminder for anyone looking to change to or keep healthier habits, regardless of weight loss goals, if any. The actual workout is performed at Ana's normal pace and is at a low to mid-intermediate level. I plan to use this workout for travel, relaxing at the end of a day, or as an add-on.

Ana's instruction is very clear and purposeful, and her tone is soft and encouraging. Her strong visualization skills greatly aid in her description, allowing the exerciser to complete each exercise with good form.",1127606400,198,5853,4.590338164251207
2334678,5,B0009XRZBK,"Finally Ana is back with a whole new Pilates workout! She definitely knows how to pack a wallop in just 30 minutes! In addition, she included the Swan, one of my absolute favorite Pilates moves. I just wish the move could have been a little longer, though. This DVD is great for anyone generally new to Pilates. The one thing I was worried about though was the long table on which she worked out too. The setting itself was beautiful on a beach, but Ana was working on top of a table, and at times I was worried that something was going to happen to her. Luckily, nothing did. This workout worked out everything to me-the core, the legs, even the arms. I so can't wait to get her other new DVDs, coming out next month on Oct. 4.",1125532800,17,728,4.244604316546763

2334711,5,B0009XRZBK,"The workout feels very tranquil, but it is great at strengthening the core muscles.  Harder than it looks at first glance, but it's not an aerobic workout by any stretch.  I think if you want calorie burn - look elsewhere.",1398038400,2,222,4.525
2334712,5,B0009XRZBK,"I liked this workout. It is a good starting routine, works and tones all the muscles. I also liked that it can be done in about a half hour so I can still get in some exercise in even if there is not a lot of time..",1393372800,,215,3.595744680851064

2334715,5,B0009XRZBK,"I don't always have the time to attend a pilates class, so I was looking for a pilates video that closely mirrored the class experience. This is the first pilates video I've done, and I was very pleased. Ana's pace and explanations of the different exercise was great, and I was able to follow along mainly by listening, without having to try to look at the TV the whole time. The setting is beautiful, and Ana's voice is encouraging and cheerful. Afterwards I felt energized and elongated and my muscles were sore and tired (but in a good way), just like when I go to a class!

I watched this on GaiamTV, so i'm not sure if the actual DVD makes this possible, but I do wish that it just started out with the workout, rather than Ana's introduction.

I am looking forward to trying more of Ana's pilates videos, but I'll definitely be doing this one again too!",1366848000,,860,4.40251572327044
2334716,5,B0009XRZBK,"I love this dvd, I had it when i first decided to try pilates as a beginner a few years ago, and it was perfect.
It was challenging but was able to do it& the more I did it the better I got.  I lost it a few years back and found it on amazon so happy to have it back in my life!  I am pretty good at Pilates now and the tape still gives me a work out as I challenge myself as the dvd is going. Its a great 30 minute pilates work of the core and always have a small sweat when im done.  I highly reccomend it!",1360713600,5,508,3.517857142857143
2334717,5,B0009XRZBK,"I like this video. It has helped strengthen my back, abs and legs. I recommend using this video three times per week to see results.",1360368000,4,132,4.32
2334718,5,B0009XRZBK,I have had this dvd for years and never used it kinda got lost in a box with all the other dvd's. I thought I would try it. I have really bad balance and flexabilty so I was kinda scared to use it. WOW! I loved it and no longer intimated. Iam not saying I did really good at it but I got through it and I really can see after much practice I too can be good. Not as good as Ana but good enough that maybe I could go to a pilates class or yoga class at the gym and not look like a idiot! I plan on using it in the morning before I go to work. I think it will help be more relaxed and maybe take on all the stress we get each day!  I do recommend it too any one new to pilates!,1359849600,,675,3.530201342281879
2334719,5,B0009XRZBK,"Very good workout. I was new to Pilates before using this video having never done it before. Ana was very good at giving basic instructions to each exercise so I could understand and follow along. Although I'm not as flexible as I'd like to be, I was still able to do most of the exercises. I highly recommend it.",1347408000,2,313,4.322033898305085
2334720,5,B0009XRZBK,"My friend loaned me her copy of this program and I have yet to give it back. I think it was challenging yet not overwhelming for a beginner. I've been using this for at least a month or more and do this at least 1-2 times a week (I have others I rotate between now because after about 2-3 weeks I really just got bored with only having one video and one routine.

I tried the 5 day fit mix and it's ok, there's a few routines I'll try after I've mastered the PM Pilates but overall I really like this one better. My only complaint and why I mention the 5 day fit is that the Easy Pilates section there had some modifiers for teasers and the 100 that are way easier on my neck and that I wish this video had.  But overall it's still great and a great work out, especially if you're new and not all that flexible. After about 5 days of trying I was able to do most of the more challenging poses with not as much difficulty. On my first try after viewing the video I was able to do all but maybe 3 of the poses at least presentably.

It should be noted I kind of fell into this by accident and had experimented with a few different forms of exercise before hand - things like Zumba and even gave Piloxing a try, but I like this because it's challenging but lower impact. I can't do a lot of intense cardio for minutes on end because I have some breathing issues. This gives me a workout without me having to pause or stop to have to catch my breath. Plus I find it pretty relaxing and soothing and I feel it working but I'm never sore or overworked that I can't do it the next day. For me, being able to do something consistently is key too. I like things simple, straightforward, and easy to follow. I also think that even if I may not have lost weight (I haven't really weighed to check) at least I feel better, my breathing and balance seem to also be better, which is a good thing, I think.

I've tried yoga in the past and found it OK, I seem to like Pilates a bit better and I like the fact I can do this in my room in a relatively small space without any equipment and 30 minutes is about right for me...not too short and not too long.",1344643200,,2139,4.025882352941177
2334721,4,B0009XRZBK,"I ordered this DVD last Thursday and it arrived at my home by Monday. Overall I think it's a great workout.

I ordered this DVD as well as Pilates for Weight Loss with Karen Garcia, and my only dissapointment would be that this DVD is one of the exact same workout that Karen Garcia does. But, on Karen Garcia's workout you can choose Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced level with about 5 different workouts in each section.
This DVD is only 30 minutes and the other has about 3 hours of different workout's you could do.

Don't get me wrong, I do like this one! But for the money I would say to order the one by Karen Garcia because you get more for your money, and more workouts!

This one is still part of my collection and I plan to keep it in alternation with the other Pilates DVD's I have, especially if I don't have much time to fit my workout in.

Not a bad buy! It's overall a good one..just has the EXACT same workout that you can find on the one with Karen Garcia.",1340841600,5,977,4.208556149732621

I bought Ana's ""Core Challenge"" over the weekend, and that was a mistake.  As a person new to Pilates, THAT workout is WAY TOO DIFFICULT for me.  The ""Quick Start"" is not.  My daughter and I had been exercising to her ""Quick Start,"" but it was my daughter's copy and she took it with her to college.  So I bought my own!",1340582400,,454,4.160919540229885

Lots of fun and not difficult.",1307664000,,249,4.319148936170213
2334725,3,B0009XRZBK,"This video has many of the same moves repeated in Ana Caban's other workout videos.

2334726,4,B0009XRZBK,After doing a bit of Pilates at the gym I decided to give it a try at home. I was quite impressed with the instruction and camera angles used. The exercise wasn't overly strenuous and I felt refreshed and relaxed after doing it. It's a bit disappointing that it's only 30 mins long (excluding the CD) but it still makes for a bit of stiffness and a feeling of having exercised. The only thing I'd suggest it to play the DVD on a laptop and put it down next to you on the floor as you'll be lying down for quite a bit of the workout.,1295913600,,532,4.028301886792453
2334727,5,B0009XRZBK,"When I bought this DVD I had been to a few Pilates classes here and there but never stuck to it for long.  Because of this, the pace felt really good and I was mostly familiar with the names of the moves, so the minimal instructions worked nicely.  For someone brand-spanking-new to Pilates, I'd recommend getting a DVD that is explicitly for beginners, or better yet, go to a class with a knowledgeable instructor.  I like to alternate this DVD with Gaiam's Cardio Burn Yoga for my morning workouts, and I find that this one especially leaves me feeling refreshed and with plenty of energy to start the day.  It's honestly a better wake up than coffee for me.

Since I've gotten this DVD I've started going to a Pilates studio 2-4 times a week, so I feel like I've progressed to the somewhat advanced level.  Even though this DVD feels a lot easier after my real life classes, I still like it as quick workout.  I do wish there were a longer version of the workout like on the Yoga DVD in which we could do more reps or more advanced moves, but oh well.  I'll probably invest in one of Ana's other DVDs for days when I can't make it to class.  A few reviewers have noted that this DVD goes slowly, which I like.  In Pilates it's not about working up a sweat, it's about doing the moves correctly--most of the time you're going to get a better workout by going slowly and consciously holding the positions correctly, not by zipping though them as quickly as possible.  I doubt that you will lose weight just by using this DVD, but in addition to more intense workouts and a healthy diet it will definitely help.  So, scoop in your abdomen, lower your shoulders, and get started!",1279843200,2,1678,4.412337662337662
2334728,2,B0009XRZBK,"I bought this dvd because I read that Ana Caban was pretty good.  However, all the the exercises done in this video are the same as those done the windsor pilates series.  That wasn't necessarily a deal breaker, but the narration was.  Ana is performing the excercises and her voice is later added to describe the movements.  She talks like she is reading a children's book at a Barnes and Noble which is really annoying.  Honestly one of the worst workout videos just because of this narration.",1275091200,,495,4.64367816091954
2334729,4,B0009XRZBK,"This is my second Ana Caban pilates video and I think she's great.  Excellent cues in regards to breathing, neck positioning (just when she says to pull my shoulders away from my ears, I realize that they were there) etc.  I wish she explained or showed a bit more modification for some of the harder moves, but I've been able to make it work and love this video!  30 minutes goes by in a flash....and I feel like I've really worked my body after this video.",1272326400,3,458,4.3023255813953485

At this point, I would call myself an advanced beginner, but I just cannot do many of the excercises in this video and there are no modifications. I bought this to work on my core muscles and am highly dissapointed that I can't use it.

I didn't give this one star because even though I can't do it, it is obviously a good workout, the instructor isn't annoying and the setting is wonderful.",1235088000,2,603,4.327433628318584

The moves were not explained (although I was familiar with them). Ordering their weight loss plan/dvd etc...was the main focus. The work out was not worth it, and since I didn't need or want their diet, it was not worth it. There are many better pilates dvds out there, and for much less. Save your money on this one. A total waste of time. There are several other starter dvds pilates, yoga I ordered and bought that I had to struggle through because of lack of muscle tone.

This first time every group of my abs SCREAMED for 3 days.  Now, I can push myself to resist and make the moves more intense and I STILL enjoy the program.  Usually the women on exercise tapes make me want to GAG, but I thought Ana was pretty good- low key and practical.

For the most part I enjoyed the ""workout"", though I can't really call it that.  I did not break a sweat at all and certainly didn't feel as though I got a full body toning exercise.  It provided a fun way to stretch, and worked the abs a bit, but I didn't feel like I got a good workout at the end.
I didn't really like the way Ana Coban seemed to talk to you as though you were a child either, but it wasn't unbearable.
I would recommend this DVD for someone who likes movement, stretches, and wants to increase balance and flexibility, but not for someone serious about weight loss, as there's a lack of anything cardio or strength training related.",1198800000,4,785,4.178807947019868

Ana Caban guides you through a number of familiar Pilates exercises including the hundred, roll-ups, leg circles, rolling like a ball and the teaser. The serene-by-the-sea setting is relaxing as Ana Caban works out in a pink outfit on a sapphire mat on a platform above the waves. This energetic workout is perfect if you only have a half hour to exercise and want to boost your metabolism. The precise instruction makes this workout a pleasure.

I also love that this workout is only 30 minutes, so I never have an excuse not to do it.",1174953600,3,351,3.9014084507042255
2334744,5,B0009XRZBK,"I like how she clearly calls out each movement so that there is no guessing about when to bend my legs, etc.  I like how the overall tone of the dvd feels very calm and not rushed (the music and scenery are relaxing) WITHOUT the video feeling slow or boring; I think she accomplishes this by moving from one exercise to the next without downtime, so I don't feel like I'm wasting time (this is in contrast to the Windsor Pilates ""Basics set"", which spends a very boring amount of time talking about each move instead of just showing or doing the move. The Windsor would be good for absolute beginners who want a detailed How-To tutorial).  Anyways, She managed to get through a suprising number of different moves in half an hour, so I felt like I had decent abs/leg adductors workout from it (but keep in mind Pilates is low impact, so it's not going to make you sweat as much as aerobics).
Also, on the same disc users have the option verbal cues in SPANISH.

UPDATE:  Since I wrote my initial review, I have tried at least 10 other company's pilates workout, and I would say Ana Caban's is still one of my favorites. She goes through a variety of moves but doesn't feel rushed, she cues well but doesn't talk talk too much, and the background is beautiful.",1158883200,52,1259,4.413793103448276
2334745,3,B0009XRZBK,"As someone who's only worked with Pilates a few times (but enjoyed it) and wanted to find an exercise program to lose weight, I thought I'd stumbled across a gem when I found this DVD. Nothing could be farther from the truth! The workout moved entirely too quickly for someone new to Pilates, and the intensity was diffcult for someone out of shape. I gave up before the workout was half-over because I was literally too exhausted to go further.

It might be a great workout for someone more experienced and more in shape, but those who want to begin losing weight with Pilates should look elsewhere. This isn't the DVD for those of us who are out of shape.",1156464000,17,657,4.475
2334746,4,B0009XRZBK,I bought this DVD based on the reviews stating it was a good intro to pilates. It really is a good workout. I also bought at the same time the Giam Beginning Mat Workout. I should have started with the Beginning Mat Workout DVD as it has modifications to some of the exercises I had difficulty with on the Pilates for Weight Loss. Still it's a great workout and I will continue to do it.,1148774400,21,387,4.173333333333333
2334747,5,B0009XRZBK,"I Love this video. I used Ana's Beginners Mat Workout Video for several years, but needed to upgrade to a DVD when I started traveling for work (to play on laptop).  It is really great. I would suggest starting with the beginner's mat workout video, to get familiar with some of the moves a little more. I haven't listened to the CD yet, but hope to get that on my MP3 player so I can finish my workout at the gym with some pilates.",1141862400,14,432,4.142857142857143
2334748,5,B0009XRZBK,"The details of this workout has already been wonderfully described by the previous reviewer, so I'll just add that I think it's very nice!  It has a great variety of pilates poses and it is very beautifully produced.  Ana looks so nice and fit and the location on Malibu beach is a calming choice for backdrop.  I'm glad that Ana slowed the pace down a bit in this workout-it gives me a chance to improve my form and I can really feel my muscles toning and strengthening while I hold each pose!  And I like that the workout only requires 30 minutes of my time.  The ironic thing is that I didn't even buy this for weight loss-I just wanted a good, slower-paced pilates workout.",1132876800,11,677,4.384
8069687,5,B0009XRZBK,"I owned this dvd years ago and had great success with it over a 4 month period. With a decent diet and this tape, I was able to loose weight and shape my body. It was a bit insane because people actually thought I had some type of surgery. So once again, I am trying it and hoping for better results.",1525737600,,300,3.9344262295081966

8069689,5,B0009XRZBK,Excellent DVD.  Ana Caban is a wonderful instructor.  I have several of her DVDs and this one is also great,1499904000,,107,4.3
8069690,1,B0009XRZBK,I bought this same exact DVD maybe 5 years ago and never got around to opening it.  Lo and behold when I finally did the music would play during the exercise part but the voice over instruction isn't audible at all.  I tried different menu settings to no avail...I was bummed!  Since I really wanted to do Pilates with this DVD I ordered another one.....I guess I should've know that it would be defective just like the other one.  Anybody else had this problem with their copy?,1489449600,,478,4.459770114942529
8069691,5,B0009XRZBK,"Very helpful for a good start!  I used it years ago, gave it away, then fell off the exercise wagon for a year.  When it was time to start back up, I missed this one -so glad to have found it again!",1472256000,,198,3.6904761904761907

8069693,5,B0009XRZBK,I LOVE this video. It is challenging for a beginner but not too hard to be able to complete the entire video. Ana Caban is great. She gives simple instructions and explanations.,1453593600,,177,4.5625
