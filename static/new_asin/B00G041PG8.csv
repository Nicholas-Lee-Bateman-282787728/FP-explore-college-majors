6042344,4,B00G041PG8,"Fabulous, breath taking action ski movie! Do not try this type of skiing at home or anywhere else unless you are very very good. I am pretty much a retired skier, but I was telling my otherwise normal-seeming doctor about this film and he said he was familiar with it and does much the same stuff - jumping out of helicopters to ski down near-vertical cliffs. You might want to pay attention to the memorials at the end...",1391731200,,422,4.423076923076923
6042345,4,B00G041PG8,"I tried to get the whole sherpa, nature, otherworld interconnectivity vibe, but wanted to watch skiing in interesting places.
Will watch this film again and see if it relates diffently a second time around. all in all good skiing and scenery.",1390348800,,242,4.926829268292683
6042346,1,B00G041PG8,"I'll have to say I was less than impressed.  My buddies and I normally go see a ski film each fall to begin the planning of our guys ski trip and to get pumped up for the upcoming season.  We still planned the trip but the first thing on our agenda was to plan another outing to watch an actual ski film.  Cinematically it was very cool but it had very little actual skiing footage.  If you liked the movie Clockwork Orange and have any Andy Warhol prints this film is for you.  For me I'll stick with the true ski movie production companies MSP, TGR, PBP(no not Warren Miller).",1386633600,,578,4.218181818181818
6042347,2,B00G041PG8,Decent story line but if you want to see any snow sports pick a different movie. The few times they actually tackle some ski/boarding it is choppy and short. The cinematography is amazing but it is the whole movie and after a while you just want to see someone hit a slope.,1386201600,2,273,4.269230769230769
8619841,5,B00G041PG8,"This is one of my favorite films. Minimal dialogue, so it isn't for everybody. But if you are into stellar visuals and love action sports, this is for you. The cinematography is top notch and the athletes are also incredible. Despite the fact it has minimal dialogue, there is a story that threads the film.",1515888000,,307,4.6
8619842,5,B00G041PG8,Awesome movie. Great deal.,1482969600,,26,5.75
8619843,5,B00G041PG8,"This is a completely unique and beautiful ski film.  It breaks the stale mold of some other companies like TGR and MSP and greatly captures the beauty of the mountains and various means to ski downhill with unique segments telling a loose story.  Other than the classic Greg Stump films and the old Warren Miller movies (when he was still involved), this is at the top of my list.",1482278400,,380,4.492753623188406
8619844,1,B00G041PG8,"This is both hard to watch and to listen to.  It is extremely weird music if you want to call it that.....sounds like you are being sound tortured throughout the entire movie.  The movie is just a bunch of visuals with very little connection and absolutely no explanation.  At first the shots are extraordinary with exceptional visuals that  appear to be going somewhere....but after about 5 minutes you realize that you are in the middle of a big commercial with one add after another with companies like Monster drinks popping up all over the place.
You soon realize that this is a visual and audio version of waterboarding.  Just painful.",1477872000,,641,4.790909090909091
8619845,5,B00G041PG8,A truly great visually stimulating ski movie. 'Into the mind' is the gold standard of ski movies. Sherpa cinemas is on a roll of making visually & audibly stunning movies. Perfection!,1455753600,,183,4.935483870967742
8619846,5,B00G041PG8,"outstanding, glorious eyecandy and a great story!!!!!!!!!",1428364800,,57,7.285714285714286
8619847,3,B00G041PG8,"Read most reviews about this video and they all say the same thing... not a great ski video.

These statements are 100% accurate.

In a nut shell, there is too much concept and too little skiing. The video contains maybe 15 minutes of skiing shrouded in 60 minutes of filler. The skiing is good, but nothing special. The concept work is overly textured and the multiple themes are discordant with each other.

Apparently, the Sherpa crew did not realize what made All. I.Can a great video; a simple clean story-line filled with tons of quality skiing, photographed beautifully.

Granted, it was a very difficult task for the Sherpa crew to equal or even best the quality of All. I.Can, but this video falls far short.

I bought this version because it came with a second video. I would have felt cheated otherwise.",1416441600,,814,4.704225352112676

8619850,5,B00G041PG8,This was a gift for my husband. Apparently he liked it since i did not hear otherwise from him.  Of course anything to do with skiing he loves.,1392854400,,143,4.107142857142857
