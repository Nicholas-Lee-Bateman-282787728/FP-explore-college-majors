7890707,5,6305510857,"My husband and I have watched this movie over and over.  It shows to people that no matter how life has treated you, or the circumstances there is hope.  If you work hard and give it everything you've got and not wait on someone to ""hand it to you on a silver platter"" so to speak.  Even tho her so called husband took everything she had, even her father, she found the strength in all adversity to pull herself back up and got well deserved revenge on her ex-husband.  As for the selling price, even tho a totally awesome movie, I feel it is way out there.  The best way to sell is keep the price where object is obtainable.",1395100800,,625,4.175

7890709,5,6305510857,"An inspirational movie for everyone, especially all victims of the system, politics, or a bully.  A subliminal love story to boot!  A sweet young lady, existing within a wealthy equestrian Virginian community, is made to look and feel a fool, by her evil, self serving and narcissist husband.  There is no evil beyond his reach, i.e.,  cheating, stealing and murder.  She goes to prison resulting from being set up by this scoundrel . . . however when she emerges, and undergoes surgery for earlier suffered disfiguring facial injuries (caused by him, she returns, as another person, unrecognized by him or the others.  Through sheer cleverness, a keen knowledge of the equestrian culture, determination and tenacity, she brings him down and exposes him for what he is.  In the end, he gets what he deserves . . you've got to see this one.  Enjoy!  PS  No adult language or situations!",1274227200,2,885,4.879194630872483

7890711,3,6305510857,"To tell you the truth, this is a nice light movie. It tells a story of a Tycoon daughter (she has a deformed face) who was manipulated by a horse trainer. This horse trainer becomes her husband and destorys her... I do not want to ruin the story. But it all revolves around REVENGE.
The actress is the one from the comedy ""Wings"". She did a good job in this film.
It is nice to watch it once, but it is not so special to be bought and kept in a library... especially for $!!!",995241600,5,475,4.010526315789473
7890712,5,6305510857,THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE! IT TELLs A STORY OF STRENGTH AND SURVIVAL! I WOULD RECOMEED THIS MOVIE TO ANY ONE WHO HAS A CARING HEART!,961632000,4,128,3.9615384615384617
