2465094,5,B000CGX87E,"Baazigar is a wonderful suspense thriller made by Abbas Mastan, but the real reason it is well-known today is quite clear, and it's called Shahrukh Khan. Disregarding its unoriginality, the film is extremely entertaining and interesting, more towards the second half. In the first half, the point is a bit unclear and the film does not flow well, but the film takes a major plot twist after an hour or so when we get to see a rather shocking scene, which is completely unexpected and is the film's most drastic turn. Following this scene, it starts getting increasingly thrilling with inflaming and unusual proceedings and great suspense. I appreciated the film for its good script and for its loyalty to the general Hindi film style despite a very distinct and innovative formula.
The film quite clearly belongs to Shahrukh Khan who skillfully displays something very disturbing within his personality. It is a very balanced performance, and Khan successfully portrays the many sides of his character, whether it's the simple guy whose pain motivates him to take revenge, the romantic hero, or the psychopathic murderer. Kajol is splendid in a performance that is both natural and intense. She comes across as a very brave and smart girl. Shilpa Shetty gives a brilliant debut performance (and she is hot!). Raakhee is typecast as the suffering mother who loses her mental sanity, and she does it well. Johnny Lever is at times hilarious and at times unbearable, Dalip Tahil does not impress much, and Siddharth is adequate but he too is a bit annoying in some scenes.
Anu Malik's soundtrack is very good: ""Baazigar O Baazigar"" is lovely, ""Kitaben Bahut Si"" is wonderful, ""Ae Mere Humsafar"" is melodious and ""Yeh Kaali Kaali Aankhen"" is too cool. Overall, Baazigar is an extremely enjoyable flick. While the first half is a bit boring, involving all the possible Bollywood masala, including action, romance and silly jokes, the second half enjoys a fantastic development of story, involving the most unconventional moves a Hindi film could have at that time. Towards the end the film gets to be even more intriguing. A very sad flashback is followed by an unpredictable ending which is heart-breaking yet satisfying. The final verdict is therefore highly positive. I recommend.",1304380800,9,2278,5.045092838196286
2465095,5,B000CGX87E,"Very Good movie just like most of SRK""s movies, he is a very good actor in my books. Didn't like the ending though, but all around it was very good.",1284681600,,148,3.966666666666667
2465096,3,B000CGX87E,"The movie opens with a mother who seems to be suffering major emotional trauma for unknown reasons. The only other family she has is her son. We then switch to son (Shah Rukh Khan) grown up who seems to be getting close to both daughters (Kajol & Shulpa Shetty) who live with their wealthy father (Dalip Tahil). He manages it so the sisters don't realize they are dating the same guy. He is obviously up to something. The girls family have a bunch of inept servants led by a forgetful Johhny Lever so drama alternates with hammy comedy early on. They then move so that the forgetfulness builds tension and adds to the plot. Although giving the plot away this is a revenge drama with a side romance. The romance isn't really fleshed out or spent much time on. Later in the movie particularly we have blood and deceit begetting more blood and deceit so avoid this if your preference is light romance!
SRK won an award for best actor with this movie and he does do a good job (no hammy overacting). The other actors are also good.
The screenplay and music director also won awards. I don't relate to the music of this era (1993) much but there is one very catchy song and dance piece in it. Nor do I enjoy revenge themes, a lot of violence or hammy Indian comedy. It's certainly not a happy little movie and SRK plays a complex role but particularly explores the dark side.
However I do appreciate the way they put the plot together and the general cinematic sensitivity -many Hitchcockian moments and exploring some different shots and suspense builders.
On the basis of that (and the catchy song  - with some costumes that are a cross between Saturday Night Fever and the Village People!)I'd put it a bit above average. Elsewhere on the Net it tends to also be a bit above average  e.g. 7/8 out of 10.",1244160000,4,1800,4.468085106382978

2465100,5,B000CGX87E,"This movie is under the category of ""so bad, it's good."" I usually like dramas but this movie goes over the top with its drama even by Bollywood standards. Everything bad that can happen, happens to SRK's character. The acting is of the ""chewing the scenery"" variety which adds to the entertainment value.

I won't call this a ""good"" movie. But it is highly entertaining and I would recommend it to others. Don't be intimidated by the long runtime, just skip the stupid music and dancing scenes and the movie is much shorter!!",1472601600,,526,4.655913978494624

Shahrukh does an outstanding job and I would watch this film again and again. He may have done some bad things in the film that I consider a psycho but I can understand his rage and wanting revenge even if he caused harm to some innocent people.,1400284800,,508,4.08
2465142,5,B000CGX87E,"This movie is really superb showing SRK's flexibility as an actor. Frankly I prefer him as a villain and find I have more sympathy for him than in his romantic roles.

2465144,4,B000CGX87E,"Great film! Love this jodi, SRK & Kajol. Item wax packaged nicely & it arrived on time. The reason this isn't a 5 star review is because the subtitles were a bit delayed & that's frustrating.",1375574400,2,191,4.333333333333333
2465145,1,B000CGX87E,"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I mean that in no way against the actors in this movie. However, the person who wrote the script, or came up with the plot, I have no idea what they were up to, or what they were thinking!

Most movies where the hero is killing people, it's because those people are 'bad guys' - they killed his mother when he was a boy or killed his wife. In Baazigar though, the 'hero', Shar Rukh Khan's 'Ajay Sharma' is into killing innocent people.

When Ajay was a boy, Madan Chopra stole his families' fortune in a very cunning manner, even after Madan had sweared upon his daughter Seema that he was a reformed man who was sorry for stealing 50 Lahks, which he served 3 years jail for. Ajay's Dad and Sister get sick and die. Madan's actions probably led to it, but he didn't physically slaughter them. Does it really justify Ajay throwing helpless Seema from a building? If he threw Madan off a building, that I could understand, but why the daughter? Because he swore upon his own daugther?

It seems the makers of this movie can't decide, also, whether Ajay is the hero or the villain - one minute he's coldly killing innocent people like Ravi and Anjali, and has this mad look in his eyes as if Darr is being reprised, and at other times he's a blubbering goody goody who cares so much about his mother. Also, the whole sub-plot about him stealing his friends name (Vicky Malhotra) is awkward, why doesn't he just come up with his own, new name?

Also, when Madan's daugher Seema dies, he doesn't seem to care at all, he talks about family honour or some rubbish. Even the most evil of villains cry in vain if their own flesh and blood are dying, but such is the lack of consistency in this plot. And I almost fell over when Ajay told Priya that what she had suffered (having him kill her sister) was nothing compared to what he'd been through. Yikes the poor girl had her sister killed and the audience is supposed to believe that? The way it's delivered as if it's the truth.

All you know in the end is you will see bloodied faces with shards of glass sticking in them, killing, more killing, and never really knowing why, and the best comedic efforts of Johnny Lever and his bumbling fellow servants cannot save it.",1357603200,,2264,4.393794749403341
2465146,5,B000CGX87E,"My daughter received this as a gift from me for Christmas and she just loved it.  she too is a big SRK fan, for him to play a villan in the movie is a nice change of pace",1357603200,2,170,3.473684210526316
8099047,4,B000CGX87E,"Acting wasn't bad. Story was pretty good with some questionable twists. For example: why did he push the older daughter over the roof top? Also if he really didn't have a conscience, why didn't he kill the younger daughter? It was pretty extreme for taking revenge on someone who just stole your family's business and riches.",1515369600,,325,4.821428571428571
8099048,4,B000CGX87E,"The less known about the plot, the better the viewing experience for this drama.  Briefly, Shah Rukh Khan plays a man who is courting two sisters (played by Shilpa Shetty and Kajol) under two different personas.  He has pressing reasons, which the viewer learns through well-told back story as the film progresses.

This often tense film delivers an impressive surprise early on, and keeps the viewer on edge through out.  Khan delivers an excellent performance, and Kajol and Shetty do well, also.  The music and choreography are only average, keeping the movie from a full five stars.  Otherwise, this is an impressive, suspenseful, and emotional film (reminiscent of Hitchcock) that is well worth watching.

Cast also includes: Master Sumeet, Johnny Lever, and Dalip Tahil.",1512172800,,776,5.209677419354839

I took a chance with $3 and purchased it on the spot.  Some were complaining about the print quality, but I think it is decent.  It's my favorite movie.
