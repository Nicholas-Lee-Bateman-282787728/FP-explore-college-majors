Even though I have used this for as long as it has been on the market, I will continue to buy these so I always have an extra on hand. I have the exercises and breathing memorized, but I feel it's important to use the video, just to make sure you keep the timing right.  For anyone looking to buy this, please also check out Rashelle Haines' LifeLift OxygenLift program (yes, the words are run together like that). She is actually the individual who taught Greer Childers (Body Flex) the breathing technique, so I want to give her and her program credit as well. I also have her DVDs which I love, love, love!  Not only does this breathing technique work the body, but it also works the mind, heart, and soul.",1414195200,,775,4.337931034482758
