I spotted this one and picked it up to check out. Once I got home, I was a little hesitate about another workout DVD. So glad it was for beginners and really was! Some will say but seems a bit discouraging or harder than meets the eye for those who are not working out or obese/overweight.

I love that she has a pregnant mommy, heavy-set woman like myself (voluptuous), a male, and another lady with a cute shape. She also works out with them, not walking around and telling them to do it. She also knows when you will be sluggish, cheat, or feel beat but not defeated. They are sweating too, and working out with you. I felt so comfortable and see how they make it through, especially Kay, so I can do it. My mother loves this one! She wants to dub it but cannot do that. So I hope she gets her copy while it is on sale.

This woman is a blessing! She has been on my radio program in the past, and in Release the Weight group on Facebook. She helps us tremendously. I plan to get her other DVDs in the future. Right now, have Soul Stretch and this one!

This is my favorite DVD of all time, or other ones I have in my home. Taebo, Taimak, and Slim 6 are a few others.

8062749,5,B0009KQP5A,"I absolutely love this video! The warm-up is easy on the knees.  Instead of the usual squats and lunges, Althea uses step-knee lifts, kickbacks and other easy moves to gradually get you into the groove.  I also like the smooth music and steady pace of the main aerobics part of the workout.  It is high energy without being frantic.  Althea cues well so you know what is coming and describes the easy movements thoroughly.  I like the diversity in the students, there is a male student, a pregnant student, an older student and a teenager.  It's fun with moves like ""background singer"" and ""choir"".  The production quality is excellent with sound at the right level and a nice studio.  I checked out her other video samples on youtube and they seem to be more intense so I am glad I was able to purchase a copy of this one.  I am going to purchase her ""Soul Stretch"" video next. I highly recommend you get a copy of this video while the gettin' is good!",1332547200,,953,4.431034482758621

8062751,5,B0009KQP5A,"I do not like complicated choreography at all; my speed is more along the lines of Leslie Sansone.  This workout was very easy to follow along, the moves were all low-impact, and I positively LOVED the jazzy soundtrack.  This was a nice change-of-pace from my normal walking routine; highly recommended for those wishing for a low-impact workout with steps that are fun and easy to catch on to!",1170460800,3,394,4.779411764705882
8062752,4,B0009KQP5A,"This was the first video I tried by Althea Lawson. I was a bit surprised by her personality--I had expected her to be very high energy, but she's actually more on the low-key side. I also though this would be more of a dance workout, but it consisted mainly of more traditional aerobic moves with a few dancey twists thrown in.

The workout begins with a 6-minute warm-up. The first two-thirds consisted of a sequence of very basic moves, including a walk forward/back, grapevine, knee lifts, and hamstring curls, whereas the last third of the warm-up is comprised of simple stretches. The aerobic portion of the workout is broken down into three main segments. In the first two (4 and 5 minutes each), Althea teaches two simple combos: 1) a diagonal walk with kick/hop, ""shoop"" side shuffle, and dance step back, and 2) a mambo, box step, v-step, side squat. She adds the warm-up sequence to these two combos, putting them all together and frequently taking it from the top. In the last 9 minutes of the aerobics section, Althea adds another, slightly more intense sequence involving front, side, and back kicks plus jumping jacks. She then combines this combo with the ones from the first half and performs the entire series repeatedly. There are also two segments to the cool-down. The first section consists of very low intensity marches and moving stretches, and the second half involves floor stretches (reclined leg stretch, twist) and a brief lying relaxation. The entire workout comes in right around 30 minutes.

Althea incoporates some small hops and jumps into the aerobics section, but two of her four background exercisers (one of whom is pregnant) always show a low-impact version. Althea mirror-cues very well, and she makes it easy to follow along with her frequent repetitions during the aerobic section. The DVD is very well chaptered, allowing you to play the entire workout, to choose each section individually, or to select certain segments (such as the aerobic portion only). The DVD also includes a 3-minute line dance plus a bloopers segment.

Although the aerobic portion of this workout is fairly short at 18 minutes, it remains at a pretty good intensity level the entire time, and I definitely worked up a sweat. However, the ""fun factor"" for the video was not quite as much as I'd hoped, as I had expected it to be a bit more dancey and high energy. Still, this is a decent, moderately intense, moderately fun workout that would be appropriate for beginning to intermediate exercisers.",1129507200,7,2515,4.89906103286385
