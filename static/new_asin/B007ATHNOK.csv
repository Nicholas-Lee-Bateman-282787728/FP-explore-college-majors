8513611,5,B007ATHNOK,"A fantastic, suspense-filled film!
It begins by slowly laying the groundwork for the story with the interpersonal relationships between the main characters, mixing black comedy and betrayal with apprehension about what will happen next.
It starts with an ex-con trying to go straight, his supportive wife and friends who want to lure him back into crime.
 Plot twists abound, leading to a surprise ending.
It's a must see, must have film.",1428105600,,438,5.169014084507042
8513612,5,B007ATHNOK,"This was the source for Marky Mark's Contraband.

The DVD is functional. It plays in Linux Ubuntu this and that.

This movie is an Iceland film. It it has all the appointments that  a Hollywood
movie would have. Bought this to see if I were/was (mystery to me) in the movies from Iceland knowing
I was in their TV series, Black Angels about a group of detectives working in gloomy Reykjavik. To be honest I wanted to see what life was like in this amazing city state. Black Angels is on the same level as Law In Order: SVU. Very professional. Their violent scenes are done sloppily because that is how they are done in real life. At least they address that issue with commonsense. No one is a kick boxer.

Well, Reykjavik has just about anything you could find in the USA from microwave ovens, to Nike, to Rebok, iPads,3D cinema, HD giant screen TVs. Whatever America has so does Reykjavik. Levi jeans. How easy is that.

Am not into crime dramas. I like sci-fi. This movie is slick. I don't see why their film indusrty doesn't do sci-fi. Their language has 33 sylablles. Iceland is a cold and barren Hawaii. It is the whitest nation on Earth. You have to live there for 40 years before you can mooch of the government. Tough Latinos.

Have watched over half of it. Be sure I am in it. I know better.

What does the Icelandic Film Commission have on its plate for me? And this ain't no rhetorical question (I guess).",1376179200,,1416,4.402298850574713
8513613,5,B007ATHNOK,"I saw the American remake of this movie first...then somehow found out this is the foreign movie on which the remake was based.  The foreign version is more entertaining although the American version (with Mark Wahlberg) has the everything-coming-up-better-than-roses ending.  Both films are fast paced and the characters were well thought out.  I liked the foreign version because it portrayed everyone getting through life the best they can in Iceland, so it was more believable.  Sometimes people make the wrong choices no matter what country they live in.  Sometimes a gamble works out and sometimes it doesn't, but the thrill of getting there is what this movie has in spades.",1368576000,2,681,5.154545454545454
8513614,5,B007ATHNOK,"This is the Icelandic film that garnered so much deserved attention when it first hit the screens back in 2008. It stars Baltasar Kormakur as Kristofer, he is working as a low paid security guard. This is after he lost his job on the ships due to alcohol smuggling. Iceland has stupidly high tax on alcohol and so there are big bucks to be made in smuggling it in. He has done time for his crime but took the rap for his co smugglers, this includes best mate Steingrimur. He is also married to his ex wife, but Steingrimur seems very keen to help in their hour of need, probably too helpful.

Anyway money is tight and so Kristofer gets cajoled into doing one more job by Steingrimur, so with the money in place and a willing crew he sets off. Problem is Steingrimur has his fingers in a lot of pies and interests in Kristofer that go beyond his smuggling capabilities. Meanwhile Kris and co get sidelined in Rotterdam with a very unsavoury character indeed and all merry hell kicks off.

This is the most expensive film ever from Iceland and it does show, it is well directed, acted, shot and perfectly paced for that thriller atmosphere that can either make or break a film. It has been remade in the US as `Contraband' starring Mark Wahlberg, but Baltasar Kormakur directs it.

This is high octane, gripping, violent and actually funny on more than one occasion; so an all round ruddy treat. I have not seen the remake but as this was so good I will give it a whirl. There are enough twists to keep you guessing right up until the end, and yet this is one that you will get more out of on subsequent viewings as there is just so much packed in. If this is what Iceland can do then I wish them every success - in Icelandic, Dutch and some English, and a fair bit of cuss words this is one for action thriller fans and anyone who likes World cinema.",1336262400,8,1850,4.325648414985591
8513615,4,B007ATHNOK,"The plot about a working class smuggler sounds routine but it's very well executed. I doubt the announced American remake will be anywhere near as good. Although if it stars Mark Wahlberg, as rumored, it might be. He could do this movie justice.",1326326400,5,245,4.72093023255814
