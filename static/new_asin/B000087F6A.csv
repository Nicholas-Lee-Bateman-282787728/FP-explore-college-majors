7979425,5,B000087F6A,"If you know any movie Ruby Dee is in, it has got to be great. She and her husband Ossie Davis never did any movies
unless it was up to standards, high quality, high standards of their own, not of the studios. Same with Denzel.
He only take movies that has quality in them and a message, expect trainig day. I hate that movie.  LOL

Well, this movie is the same.  It is a great movie of 2 women fighting the government about their town.

Taking it back from the ills that it has received from bad business in their town. It is good and I don't want to tell you all about it.  JUST BUY IT AND ENJOY IT WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.  REMINDS YOU OF THE 60s fighting and protesting.

Let your kids see this so they can learn how to fight for themselves and their communities when it comes their turn as an adult.  They need to know that if you see a serious problem that affects your community and the people around you, you can FIGHT BACK and clean it up and make the people responsible, fix the problem and compensate the people.",1327363200,3,1027,4.151515151515151
