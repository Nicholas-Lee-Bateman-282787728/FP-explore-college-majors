327957,3,6301423704,"This movie was funny.  This film is also the perfect example of how critics can mislead viewers.  Is this a great movie?  Well not really, but it is quite entertaining.  Marlon Brando plays Freddy Benson, a American Army officer who uses false stories about his sick grandmother to take advantage of women.  David Niven plays Lawrence Jameson, a British man who pretends to be royalty to take advantage of women. The two eventually collide in a battle of the players to see who is better.  Their subject is Janet Walker(Shirley Jones), a sweet American woman they both meet.  The plot of this film is very simple and even repetitive at times.  However, Brando and Niven make it work.  Both are hillarious and they have great chemistry.  Jones is clearly out of her league with these two, but she tries.  Indeed the films great weakness was the lack of punch at the conclusion.  It just ended.  Where it failed Dirty Rotten Scoundrals succeeded.  It was based on the script for Bedtime Story and is a better film.  Watch this film, enjoy it, and then see Dirty Rotten Scoundrals, and enjoy it more.  The critics should agree with that.",975369600,16,1134,4.680203045685279
328000,5,6301423704,"The original is better than the sequel, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels despite Steve Martin's performance. Brando is fantastic and Niven is more effective. The sequel's revised ending changes the entire moral and meaning of the film.

Too bad it's not North American format. Some DVDs play PAL, but it played on my Mac and I was easily able to use AirPlay to watch it on TV.",1391558400,,367,4.6461538461538465
328001,4,6301423704,"Much funnier than the remake Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Niven and Brando exchange brilliantly funny dialog.  The quality of the transfer is blurry and second rate.",1391040000,2,161,5.44

328004,5,6301423704,"This is a great movie that I'd never seen before, though I'd seen Dirty Rotten Scoundrels growing up, but bought for my parents on their request.  Thankfully, it's different enough from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels that even if your a fan of the version with Steve Martin in Marlon Brando's role, you will still enjoy this one.  Marlon Brando's character really is in the military, unlike Steve Martin, until his latest escapade sends him homeward-bound.  He meets up with scheming, though high-class David Niven on the train away from camp, and the two end up battling for Shirley Jones' money.
*Spolier alert*
My favorite part of this movie was that it did not end the same way as the re-make, and in fact, I liked this ending better.",1377475200,,731,4.74015748031496
328005,5,6301423704,"This movie is extremely funny, it's the original version of the film,""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"". If you found that film with Steve Martin and Michael Cain funny, then you will find  ""Bedtime Story"" hysterical. The ending is different and unexpected.

328007,1,6301423704,"The movie is ok, the actors are great but the image quality on this DVD is really really awful. I still have some VHS tapes and even those copies are much better than this one. So don't waste your money on this item. It's better not to see this movie at all than see it on this copy.",1370131200,,283,3.896551724137931
328008,4,6301423704,"Watching this film is a guilty pleasure, like cranking up even bad Beatles songs on the car radio or enjoying The King Of Queens.  Lowbrow to the max, it is Brando at his campiest and Niven at his most charming.  The script is unapologetically sexist and ridiculous and in bad taste but tons of fun if you roll with it.  Two gigilos competing for territory, Niven the suave Englishman, Brando the coarse American (no, not played against type), the first one to bed the rich heiress wins, the other is banished to take their trade elsewhere. Produced by the same wits that developed and produced The Beverly Hillbillies, it's no great work of art but hey, it's Marlon Brando doing broad comedy visible all the way to the cheap seats, no method acting required.  Set on the Riviera in the early 60s, it's a classless It Takes A Thief. I'm a Brando fan and rather than being offended I enjoy his squirrely performance here as the penultimate cad.  Not a great movie but a guilty pleasure to be sure.",1365811200,,996,4.5418994413407825
328009,5,6301423704,This is the original story from which Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Michael Kane and Steve Martin. It is every bit as hilarious and way worth watching. I've never seen Marlon Brando in such an excellent role.,1361318400,,207,4.777777777777778
328040,2,6301423704,"I ordered the DVD ""Bedtime Story"" because I had seen the movie back in 1964 or 1965 and enjoyed it very much. I couldn't find the movie anywhere, not even Netflix. So when I saw that it was available on Amazon I was anxious to order it.

Unfortunately the copy that I received was very poor quality. The picture was distorted and was very hard to see. I was still able to follow the story and still enjoyed the story line even though the picture was poor.

If anyone is interested in the story, the movie ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" is a remake of ""Bedtime Story"" and I actually liked it better than the original.",1358985600,,611,4.350877192982456

328043,5,6301423704,"I've seen my share of funny movies over the years, and this one rates right at the top.  I was overcome by uproarious laughter from scene to scene all the way through.  Furthermore, enough praise cannot be bestowed on the acting of the two principal characters, David Niven and Marlon Brando.

Furthermore, to my mind, this film proves beyond a doubt that Brando has to be the equal of any actor who ever lived.  Not even Cary Grant can match him in ability to play serious and comedy roles with equal vigor and skill.  His performance here was every bit as dynamic as were those in A Streecar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, The Godfather, or any other movie he's noted for.

I should add that, despite the fact that your advertisement indicates the DVD as being playable on Zone 2 only, I found no such computer adjustment to this effect necessary.  My recommendation is that this point be double-checked, and any appropriate correction made, in the interest of increased saleability.",1348963200,,987,4.7368421052631575
328044,5,6301423704,"This is such a fun movie to watch and my family and I couldn't stop but laugh.

The movie distributor or studio should re-issue this movie to ensure the top quality it deserves.

One of our greatest actors now is dead.  BRANDO IS A NATIONAL TREASURE.

It is our responsibility as his fans as well as movie goers to ensure his legacy is preserved for future generations, which should include the preservation of this movie Bedtime Story. It is a showcase of how comedy should be acted.",1340323200,4,484,4.528735632183908

Unable to contact anyone at Movie Mars other than by email. I could download a return form, fill it out, and take it to a post office to return it, but don't consider it worth the hassle. As for the movie, it was the original Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with David Niven and Marlin Brando. A great movie which no one seems to know about. I would still like an NTSC version, but don't trust them now.",1303516800,,544,4.190476190476191
328047,4,6301423704,"Bedtime Story is a fabulous 60's comedy, and for now we can only get it from the UK in a DVD format that is unplayable here unless you get the necessary attachments for your DVD player which is not worth the effort. Why in heavens can't we get a US version of a US film??!!!! And why is Amazon selling imports that are so difficult to play here? Makes no sense.

Please re-issue this to fit our DVD formats, so that we in the US can see it here. We are missing a truly wonderful comedy. The remake -  Dirty Rotten Scoundrels -  with Steve Martin and Michael Caine doesn't come close to the original version.",1296432000,,607,4.2155172413793105

328100,5,6301423704,"I have seen several trailers of this movie and wish it was out on DVD.  It is so funny and Marlon Brando is definitely a great comedic actor.  Next to this one, the Countess of Hong Kong with Marlon Brando was a riot.  Please put this one out on DVD.",1203292800,,250,3.96
328101,5,6301423704,"I was ten when the movie came out, my dad encouraged me to watch it years later when it played on television. I was hooked...

Brando is hilarious as the American GI in Europe, an egotist, sometimes crude, a hustler, preying on gorgeous women through sympathy, his good looks and his almost pathetic, hilarious charm....David Niven is the slick, cool, rich charming Englishman and yes, he's also as conniving as Brando. Though Niven is a bit smarter than ""Freddy"" (Brando) - It makes for a weird but funny and brief partnership between Niven and Brando, to seduce & fleece some very rich, sometimes beautiful, but always naive & trusting women.

Thus begins an even funnier competition between Brando and Niven, as the movie really gets rolling now...as each character underestimates the other in cons and setups, then ultimately each outwit the other...all the way until the final twist of an ironic and funny ending to the film.

A whole lot of fun along the way.....

One of the funniest, zany but also one of the truly well written comedies to come out of that early 60's era, (1964) or any era...It's a must see...Accept no substitutes, i.e. ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels""!",1170633600,12,1173,4.85

328103,5,6301423704,"This movie, very unfortunately, is out of print.  The only ""brand new"" DVD version of it that you can get is from some outfit out of England that made a pretty crappy copy of it, according to the reviews I read on Amazon UK.  And by the way you can buy that version of it cheaper on that website.

This is a very special movie to me.  I first saw it when I was at home, sick with a horrible sore throat, and it made me forget all my pain as I laughed all the way through.  Then I rented it again a few years later to watch with a guy that I had started dating, kind of to test his sense of humor.  We both laughed so hard that we cried. And you know, I think this movie cast some magic between us that day because we're still together, years and years later.

It's a great, funny, clever, and sometimes silly, movie.  I don't know why it has been panned by the critics in the past, perhaps they weren't used to seeing Marlon Brando in a comic role. Both Marlon Brando and David Niven are hilarious in this film and their chemistry is genius. You can see that they are both having a great time making this movie. I read in Marlon Brando's biography that he had to step out of the room many times while filming because he was laughing so hard. And sometimes when I watch it I think I can hear him in the backround laughing.

But I can't just take it down from my private collection and watch it, I have to go to the only video store that I know that carries it, miles away, rent it, and then watch it.  Why?  Why are so many Marlon Brando movies out of print?  One of the greatest American actors -- and a good portion of his films are out of print? It makes me think that the industry is trying to punish him for his rebellious ways - could it really be that ridiculous?

Anyways, this is turning into more of a blog than a review.  All I have left to say is REPRINT THIS MOVIE!!",1151280000,54,1878,4.026954177897574
