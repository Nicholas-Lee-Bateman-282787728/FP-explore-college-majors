3503658,5,B00005J6V1,"This DVD is simply marvelous! The DTS and 5.1DD are richly engineered making this live energetic performance of studio quality audio. I was fortunate enough to have attended both performances on October 20th and 21st 2000 at Madison Square Garden in NYC and the best of both are represented on this DVD. I actually thought the acoustics were better at his warmup show on October 18th in Wilkes Barre, PA, but the DTS audio smoked all three of the live performances.
As if Elton and his band performing 28 of their greatest hits is not enough, you will notice the energy and enthusiasm in the crowd! I have never seen anything like it or since. The whole venue was on their feet dancing and singing along. Folks of all ages were into these ready familiar tunes. The directors certainly embraced this here. The band is superb. Of particular note is the return of the legendary Nigel Olsson who makes his percussion appear effortless. John Jorgenson a master of the guitar plays many different instruments during the performance which do not appear in the credits. Back up vocals are next with a clarity and tone that is awesome. The unsung keyboard of Guy Babylon makes Elton sound great at all times. Elton's guests perform in their ranges and provide a talent that has made his duets famous. Again, not in the credits, the media reported that Elton's mother and Bernie Taupin were in attendance for the performances. One Night Only represents the first performance of ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" with Kiki Dee since their original tour (the old 1976 video was lipsynched for the purists).
 Comprehensively not least, is Sir Elton's engergetic and near flawless performance. In my opinion, he is artistically at his best and the absolute stamina of performing this show three times boggles my mind. His piano skill only improves with time. Elton's voice, though not the high pitch you will remeber, has trained to a lower more soulful and rich register that remakes his past hits to a new level.
I can not find a single reason that you will not like this dvd. Elton John junkie or not, this musical masterpiece will find itself in music lovers collections for a long time. Certainly the DTS audio alone rivals the best produced to date.",1008979200,,2236,4.762886597938144
3503659,5,B00005J6V1,"27 tracks, 2 and 1/2 hours...every song a hit! It does not get any better. Also note that the audio tracks contain BOTH 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround AND 5.1 DTS Surround. The DTS track in particular absolutely rocks so make sure you start your volume low because you will blow your speakers if not careful. Entire concert is filmed in 16.9 widescreen as well. Also contains the video for the latest Elton John hit ""I Want Love"" . A MUST-BUY for Elton John fans!!",1008633600,,460,4.488095238095238
3503660,5,B00005J6V1,"It's the reason DVDs were invented.
While I did not like, or even buy, the hacked up VHS video of this concert, I think everyone who even remotely likes Elton John should own this DVD.
Even though it's primarily hits that fans have heard dozens of times before, the extra drums (Nigel Olsson and Curt Bisquera) and the many talents of John Jorgenson really make these versions better than a lot of the rest. I love the ""Daniel"" and ""Tiny Dancer"" on this.
The supreme highlights for me though are Funeral For A Friend, Someone Saved My Life Tonght, and Come Together. I just can't get enough of this one.
It sounds and looks better than it did when I was there.",1008374400,2,660,4.418032786885246
3503661,5,B00005J6V1,"IGNORE THE VHS REVIEW of the VHS version.  THE DVD is SPECTACULAR!  28 songs, plus the I WANT LOVE video.  It's as good a concert as i could hope for - the editing, the letterboxing, the song selection (but for a few weird choices) is fantastic.  out of the 28 songs, 23 of them are fantastic versions of songs we love.  SOMEONE SAVED MY LIFE TONITE is outstanding.  it's over 2 1/2 hours long.  Elton is at top form.  DON""T GO BREAKING MY HEART will make u cry.  This is simply a must have for any elton fan.  It's on par with the recent SPRINGSTEEN IN NYC dvd in the sense that it's a definitive collection of favorite songs shot superbly.  trust me - but this immediately - you will become as obsessed with it as i am.",1008288000,,721,4.1521739130434785
3503662,5,B00005J6V1,"Elton John has played Madison Square Garden more than any other artist in history and he clearly loves the venue; and the venue loves him.  This is a great DVD -- sound and picture are exemplary.  Comments about the length of the VHS do not pertain -- this is virtually the whole concert, although clearly not from just ""One Night Only.""  (There two nights of shows.) The highlights of both nights are well represented, most notably, ""Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding,""""Candle in the Wind,""""Someone Saved my Life Tonight,""""Rocket Man,"" and ""Come Together,"" and the performances are powerful and vibrant.  Two rarely played songs, ""Club at the End of the Street"" and ""Little Jeannie"" are remarkably fresh.  Elton's piano prowess is clear as is the tightness of his veteran band, and the guests, especially Billy Joel and Mary J. Blige, are clearly paying homage to one of their mentors.  This DVD is a must-have!!!",1008288000,,920,4.941558441558442
3503663,5,B00005J6V1,"I was a little bit worried when I ordered this DVD, due to the lack of information about what audio and picture format the disc would have. Just relax, all of you Elton and DVD fanatics out there. The picture is widescreen 16:9 and you can chose from three different sound tracks - 2 Ch Stereo, DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1. The photocomposition is very nicely done, no MTV-clips here, though the sharpness in the picture could have been better. The DTS audio track is a very fine one, Elton's vocal very much in the center, the band + backing vocals concentrated in the front speakers but with a nice surround feel and the audience and occasionally some of the instruments in the rear speakers.
So finally there is an Elton DVD concert of the quality you can demand from an artist of his caliber. And you get the complete concert, 27 songs, compared to the CD that had 15 or 17 songs depending on version. And I honestly think that there are many of those extra songs on the DVD that are better than many of those which ended up on the CD compilation. I guess the criteria for the CD was the hit-factor of the songs.
Highlights for me is Bennie and the Jets (soulful vocal), Tiny Dancer (nice vocals in the chorus), Daniel (beautiful stripped down arrangement), Little Jeannie and Club at the end of the street (two gems never heard live before, Elton is ""hungry"" in these songs), Blue Eyes (terrific rendition of a terrific song), Sorry seems to be the hardest word (superb as always), I guess that's why They call it the Blues (with a fantastic Mary J Blige), Saturday Night's alright for fighting (with an outstanding Anastacia) and Come together (as a tribute to the late John Lennon). I could go on and on...
There are also songs we have heard better and more lively versions of in other concerts; Goodbye Yellow Brick Road with Billy Joel doesn't do it for me, Elton's solo version on the CD is much superior. Candle in the Wind and Don't let the Sun go down on Me both sound a little bit tired and without real inspiration.
But all together, this DVD is a real joy for all of us who knows that Elton is a true musical genious. Elton in top form + a good band + an enthusiastic audience + widescreen + DTS 5.1  --- I mean, how can you ever go wrong whith a combination like this?",1008201600,4,2276,4.367924528301887
3503664,4,B00005J6V1,"Elton John's newest video, One Night Only, is a must for any Elton John fan.  It far surpasses the network special which was infested with commercials and bad editing.  The solo performances, as well as duets with Billy Joel, Kiki Dee, Bryan Adams, etc. are, as usual, well done.  The energetic audience and Elton's usual banter are a definite plus.  Elton is backed by original band members Davey Johnstone and Nigel Olsson as well as his newer bandmaters.  The set takes us down memory lane with songs from his self titled album, Elton John, to a few from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and others.  I do miss not having any of his most recent recordings included, but, since Elton has not visited my hometown in a couple of years it's nice to see him again, even if it is on video.",990316800,6,780,4.49645390070922

It displays Elton's true friendship to his guest stars, and of course his fans who attended this event. The entire band was wonderful and also showed their true colors and skills. With each and every concert that myself and my wife attended to live (11) but who is counting? It is fun watching Elton tease Nigel Olsson,Bob Birch,and Davey Johnson throughout this and every other concert. Most people miss this as his wonderful band pops and rocks the house down. This DVD also is a keeper as a lot of surprises will make you rock in your own home or away and want to enjoy your day or night in rocket land.(Turn them on) and relax for the money it is a true adventure.

whole 2000 show at the Madison Square Garden, which lasts more than
two and a half hours. It is a kind of collection of the best of
previous recordings. If you have a Movie Theater or even a good 49

Goodbye Yellow Brick Road w/ Billy Joel is phenomenal, and all of Elton's hits are here, i guarantee you will want to sing along!  My only complaint is that Mary J.

HOWEVER, I've watched this on a Hi-Def LCD and was very disappointed with the video quality.  It looks like it was shot on VHS.  It is quite distracting.  If you are a videophile or only plan on watching this on a Hi-Def set, be prepared for very 1990's-looking video.  If you can live with that, this is a great set.",1175040000,4,656,4.547008547008547

3503755,5,B00005J6V1,"This is he complete concert that was the basis for the CBS special ""One Night Only. This is the complete 27 - song concert. The tv special and video cassette had just 12 songs. The cd had a little more with I think 17 or 18 songs. But this dvd shows the whole show. What it is is possibly Elton's best concert ever.
Elton was clearly in top form this evening. He is energetic, his keyboard playing is robust, and his voice is as powerful as it was thirty years ago. The show kicks off with Elton doing side one of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"". The best of these performances is the opening ""Funeral For A Friend""/""Love Lies Bleeding"" (this is one of the many songs I was surprised he did) and ""Bennie And The Jets"". ""Candle In The Wind"" is also well. ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" with Billy Joel is good, but I prefer if Elton had done it alone. What I really liked about this concert is in additon to doing the familliar classics like ""Philadelphia Freedom"", ""Daniel"" and ""Rocket Man"", he does many of the less successful and therefore less popular hits. These include ""Blue Eyes"", ""Club At The End Of The Street"" and ""Sacrifice"". He also shys away from the hits concept and does a blistering cover of The Beatles classic ""Come Together"" (in tribute to John Lennon).
The guest stars are a mixed bag. Like everybody else, I was glad to know that Elton had Kiki Dee come on to the stage to do ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" with him for the first time since Live Aid in 1985. Mary. J. Blige gives a soulful flare to ""I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues"". As I said earlier, Billy Joel was okay on ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"". Bryan Adams was a nice surprise on ""Sad Songs (Say So Much)"". On the other hand, Ronan Keaing was unncessary for ""Your Song"" and Anastacia could've been cut out on ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"".
Overall, a great dvd. As I said many times, this is Elton at his best. I just wish they made an accompanying documenetary. The only extra is the video for the (then) new single ""I Want Love"". Elton doesn't even appear in it. Instead, Robert Downey, Jr. lipsynchs to the song. But still, you must get this dvd. Also, get the ""Live In Barcelona"" dvd.",1090108800,8,2180,4.385185185185185

The dvd followed and included the remaining 10 songs cut. The result was an electrifying performance by onne of rock's greatest legends.
Elton seems to be enjoying himself right from the first performance,an electrifying performance of ""Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"". He continues with great versions of songs like ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"", ""Candle In The Wind"", ""Bennie And The Jets"", ""Daniel"", Rocket Man"" and many others. The duets were okay. Nothing to rave about. The only one worth mention is the surprise inclsuion of ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"". It's like 1976 all over again. Kiki Dee's voice still sounds the same. The other surpises were the rarely performed ""Club At The End Of The Street"" a cover of ""Come Together"".

Twenty seven hit songs are remixed with this fantastic DTS Surround Sound (one of the best live recordings yet - on par with the Bee Gees ""One Night Only"").  Opening with the full length version of ""Funeral For A Friend"", you can feel and hear the heavy bass and soaring synthesizers that start the show.  It never lets up with hit after hit.  Elton peppers his show with guest appearances (Billy Joel at his best), Mary J. Blige (sings perfectly, but seems nervous), Ronan Keating (wonderful and smacking of confidence), Bryan Adams (excellent), Anastacia (vibrant) and Kiki Dee (what a way to end the show - with a classic duet). One can see from the list that the emphasis is on the seventies hits and that's just fine.  The light show is brilliantly spot-on and every member of the band seems like a star.  The direction works extremely well, except (and this is a big complaint), there are too many cuts to audience members.  It is distracting to see close ups of fans dancing and singing.  I am sure the intent was to personalize the show, but it just becomes annoying.  I don't watch other people when I go to a show.  However, this is the only thing I can find less than perfect about Elton John's performance.  It is the sound that matters and this is simply the best live recording to date.  The bonus extra video of Robert Downing, Jr. singing ""I Want Love"" is brilliant.",1082764800,4,1425,4.5234375
3503760,4,B00005J6V1,"My wife and I saw Elton John in performance a few years ago in Knoxville. I was stunned from the first note to the encore. In all honesty, I don't think there is a performer anywhere that puts more raw energy per square centimeter into a performance than does Sir Elton. That energy comes through full force in this disc; Elton John obviously is having a wonderful time, and so is the audience. In fact, the only reason I don't give this disc 5 stars is from a bit of disappointment at the lack (on what was supposed to be a ""greatest hits"" disc) of two of my favorite EJ tunes, ""Pinball Wizard"" and ""Grey Seal"".
I note that some other reviewers have made negative comments about the duets; don't let them put you off this disc. Yes, perhaps it might have been more a ""pure"" EJ show without them, but take my advice, take the duets on their own merits (especially the electric performance from Anastacie), and I don't think you'll be disappointed.

3503762,5,B00005J6V1,"When it comes to live performances, few can top Elton John. Whether it's his outrageous costumes, his kicking of the piano bench or his stunts like dancing atop the piano, Elton can do it all. He has roned down his act nowadays. But that does not stop him from doing a great show, as demonstrated here. His voice is in great chape, he looks great and he still plays the piano like nobody else I know.
The show gets off to a rousing start with a stunning rendition of ""Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"". He then continues to do the entire first side of his 1973 masterpiece ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", delivering exhuberant versions of ""Candle In The Wind"", ""Bennie And The Jets"" and ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", the latter featuring Billy Joel duetting. The rest of the show takes a nice look back at his years of success. While standard fare like ""Philadelphia Freedom"" and ""Your Song"" (the latter featuring Ronan Keating) are included, there were quite a lot of track whose inclusion surprised me, like ""Little Jeannie"", ""Blue Eyes"", ""Tiny Dancer"", ""Club At The End Of The Street"" and a scorching cover of ""Come Together"". I very surprised at how well Elton performed ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"". His voice conveyed such emotion and pain.
There are many more highlights, too many list on one page. But my favorite was when Elton and Kiki Dee reunited for the first time since Live - Aid to perform ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" onstage together. This is a great dvd by a great showman and a legend at his work.",1078531200,,1523,4.623616236162362

I just love it when we get tickets to his concerts I saw the concert on t.v. a couple of years ago and I know some of the words to some of the songs and I love it when he's in town.

This would have been great had he put something out similar to ""Here and There"", where the first part was an intimate, ""unplugged"" performance, and the second half was more of a rock show.
There should be a video collection from past and present compiled in 2 DVDs. I think it's gresat to see him in the early days doing ""Your Song"" when he really didn't have much money, or some of the live shows he did for TV that haven't been seen in years. Not to mention all the videos he's done since the mid-70s. I remember seeing ""Step into Xmas"" and ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" as promo videos. I think having it end with the ""West Coast"" videos would be great.

They should have just used IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT for record mixing.
I bought this DVD based on the reviews that it almost equal that of the Eagles.  What a shame!  Eagles, Two Against Nature, QUEEN DTS, MUSIC for Monserrat (EJ performed ""Your Song"" a lot better than this ""One Night Only"" concert) are by far the best ever recorded concerts by IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT.
I am very much disappointed about the mixing.  EJ's voice fades in and out.  Bass and other instruments are OK but I still cannot compare them to EAGLES and STEELY DAN's TWO AGAINST NATURE.
It's a shame to call this DTS 5.1. I thought it should be called STEREO.  I don't mind buying another copy as long as they remix it but this time using IMAGE ENTETAINMENT.  I will definetely put it on the last of collections of DTS Music DVDs.

3503768,5,B00005J6V1,"I have posted a full review much earlier, so in this one I will only focus on the DTS audio track.
The latest reviewer was talking about this audio track as horrible and unlistenable. I just read some reviews on the newly released Peter Gabriel ""Secret World Live"", claiming the same thing regarding that DVD's DTS audio track.
To all of you who have this opinion, I have only one thing to say: GET OUT AND BUY YOURSELF A NEW AUDIO EQUIPMENT.
This DVD (and Gabriel's too) has a wonderful sound when listening to the DTS 5.1 landscape. Deep and vibrant bass, crispy treble, and the vocals beautifully placed in the surround mix, with Elton's voice up front and crystal clear and the backing vocals surrounding you.
In my opinion this DTS audio track is on the same level as Eagles ""Hell freezes over"", a reference disc when talking about good sounding concerts. The difference is that Eagles's music is more ""clinic"" and Elton's more ""organic"", but the audio quality is on par IMHO.
The video quality could have been better though, that I must admit, still it is OK for me. And who cares really - after all this is a concert DVD...;-)",1049241600,3,1133,4.5588235294117645
3503769,2,B00005J6V1,"I'm really amazed by the great reviews for this DVD.  I've double checked, and I have got exactly the same one as everyone else.  Did anybody try the DTS sound, or did they choose the 5.1 sound option?  I wonder, because the DTS is so BAD on this DVD compared to the Eagles and ELO DVD's (also DTS).  On Elton's DVD, the DTS keeps fading in and out.  Very annoying.  The friend I was watching it with thought I was playing around with the remote control.
Aside from the dreadful DTS, Elton John's voice continues to decline over the years.  Let's be fair, we know he had vocal chord operations a few years ago.  I have no problem with his piano playing, but his voice is horrible, and it is a far cry from what he used to sound like.
When the CD of this came out, it was slammed by the critics for the same 'voice' problems I've just mentioned.  On top of that, his decision to invite stars like Bryan Adams and Ronan Keating onto stage make no sense. Why get other people to sing your song worse than you now do?
The DVD picture quality is disappointing too, there's no reason why it couldn't have been clearer.
The choice of songs is acceptable, but let's face it, when he get's to the awful 80's tunes, you have to wonder why he just didn't focus on the 70's stuff throughout.  Elton John's best years were from 1970 to 1980.
In 1998 we saw Elton John and Billy Joel in concert in Sydney when they were touring together. Elton played the first half, then Billy took over.  Elton sounded awful at that concert, whereas Billy sounded fantastic. Billy sang every word clearly, whereas Elton slurred and hurried up every tune.  Everyone in our row agreed that Elton put on a poor show.
This DVD is for true fans only.",1047772800,8,1716,4.328125

It is disappointing to me that with all the modern filming and recording technology available today, they can still produce under par video quality on a DVD.

These are just a few of the hits that weren't performed out of the 27 song marathon that viewers will be treated to when buying this dvd. Recorded over two nights, this performance was the 50th and 51st performance(s) at Madison Square Garden that Elton John has played over this long career. Make no mistake about it, these songs (mainly with lyricist Bernie Taupin) continue to hold up well after some 25-30 years since they were released. All the faithful chestnuts are here (including a rare live performance of ""Little Jeannie"" from 1980's 21 @ 33 album).
While the hit formula obviously is the point of this release, die-hard fans may desire more. But be assured that these songs are delivered with a fresh approach including some guest stars along the way to keep things moving. Elton and Anastacia's ""Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting"" alone is worth the price!
The video transfer and DTS mix are incredible and will have you viewing multiple times.
Some quibbles would be that Elton does sound a little winded on a couple of songs (most notably Sad Songs with Bryan Adams) and he doesn't move around much anymore. Where he used to attack the piano, he know seems more content by treating it like an old friend. No jumping on top of it for him these days. But that doesn't matter. The music and delivery are the important things and on this one, both are achieved.",1045958400,,1527,4.680297397769516

This dvd has 27 tracks, whereas the tv show and video had 12 tracks, and the cd had seventeen tracks. Elton revived several of his lesser-known hits, as well as the usual concert warhorses.
The concert's energy is evident right from the evening's first song, a blazing ""Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"", on which Elton's piano solo sounds fresh and energetic. Elton revives many of his hits, most notably the stellar ""Little Jeannie"" and the breezy ""Club At The End Of The Street"". I also delighted in Elton's stellar performance of ""Tiny Dancer"", which never sounded better than it does here. The biggest surprise of the evening is Elton's scorching cover of ""Come Together"", a tribute to John Lennon. Elton gives emotional performances of ""Blue Eyes"" and ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"", and his vocal performances on ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"" and ""Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word"" shine. Elton's piano talents are emphasized on his wild solos on ""I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That"" and ""Crocodile Rock"".
The only bad thing about this dvd is the abundance of terrifyingly bad guest stars. While Billy Joel, Kiki Dee and Mary J. Blige are fine on their duets, Ronan Keating sounds horrible on ""Your Song"". And Bryan Adams sounds like he trying to kill himself on ""Sad Songs"", ans Anatascia seems to not know what she's doing on ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"". Still, Elton does redeem himself by giving stellar solo performances. All in all, ""One Night Only"" is a brilliant dvd.",1040688000,13,1615,4.750889679715303
3503774,5,B00005J6V1,"Somehow it's easy to overlook Elton John when considering the auteurs who make rock n' roll magical.  Maybe it is because Elton seems to have always been there creating hit song after hit song that he is often taken for granted.  That is a mistake.  This DVD offers up a non-stop stream of radio friendly pop/rock from a legendary musician with a still outstanding voice. The performances are almost too good to have been recorded live. The guest stars were mostly unnecessary but never an impediment to the enjoyment.  Billy Joel, Mary J. Blige and Anastacia turned in exciting and energetic performances.  But the credit must go to Elton John for reminding us that simply reveling in the pleasure produced by excellent rock songs is too rare these days to be taken for granted.",1038355200,,779,4.7835820895522385
3503775,4,B00005J6V1,"Overall, this is a pretty good and entertaining show. However, the guest stars tend to be distracting and annoying. It's depressing seeing Elton introduce one guest after the other, especially when bizarre choices clash with a fairly predictable setlist. While Ronan Keating sounds good on ""Your Song"", and Kiki Dee on ""Don't go breaking my heart"", Bryan Adams and Mary J. Blige are ridiculous.  In Adams' case, 'sad songs' really do say a lot.  Similarly, Blige fails miserably in her blatant attempt to take over ""I guess that's why they call it the blues,"" making the song sound unrecognizable.  While Billy Joel is expected, perhaps Elton should have been joined by George Michael on ""Don't let the sun go down on me."" One of my favorites, ""I don't wanna go on with you like that"" should have been performed like the album version, instead of the club/techno version that it is here.  As for ""Candle in the wind"", I thought he should have ended it like he did when it was released as a live single in the mid-80's. As for the sound and visual quality of the show, it's decent as well.",1037750400,,1088,4.6217616580310885
3503776,5,B00005J6V1,"If you have a great surround system with DTS, this is fantastic. Elton plays all his hits. If you've been to an Elton John concert over the last few years, you'll see he starts off this concert the same way with a great starter "" Funeral for a Friend"", ""love Lies Bleeding"". But I have to say there wasn't a bad one on the dvd. My favorites were ""I Dont Wanna Go On With You Like That"", and ""Club At The End Of The Street"", because he don't normally do those in concert. But also The Beatles ""Come Together"" was absolutely fantastic. I've been to four concerts, the most recent in New York City in March of this year and I really felt I was there in the audience of this concert.",1036540800,,679,4.151515151515151
3503777,5,B00005J6V1,"Very good DVD. Most of Elton John's greatest songs are here.

Sound is excellent.

3503778,5,B00005J6V1,"This concert DVD is great. Those old songs of this amazing singer when heard on a 5.1 digital receiver make me shake like the audience. They are very well selected. The sound quality is excellent, but the picture is strangely below good quality.
The concert was performed recently, so it's strange not to assume a good digital picture which this DVD deserves.
On conclusion it's a must buy DVD for all Elton's fans, and for those tied to the 70's music like. After rating this item 4 stars, and watch this DVD again I have to adjust the rating to 5 stars. This DVD is one of the best musical concerts, and it deserves to be on the top of my DVD music collection.",1030233600,,662,4.346774193548387

Your performance of his classic hits like ""Your Song"",""Rocket Man"", ""I don't wanna go on you like that"".His duets with Billy Joel, Anastacia, Kiki Dee, Mary J. Blidge was great.

Two of Elton's guests in this concert are also favorites of mine (Billy Joel and Bryan Adams) and offer great performances alongside Sir Elton.  It also was very cool to see Kiki Dee with Elton again!  The remainder of the guests in this concert I could have done without, and that is the only negative thing that I can share about this concert.

3503785,5,B00005J6V1,"This is a terrific DVD of someone I have been a fan of since the Empty Sky album back in 1969 or thereabouts.  The video is certainly fine.  The audio goes in and out at times.  Elton does say that the first night had technical problems.  I don't get it.  If anyone should put out a technically superior DVD it should be the Elton John management team.
The big problem are the no-talent guests.  None of them have any voice to sing about.  They are mostly an embarrassment.  Their only purpose seems to be to make Elton John look good.  He clearly sings better than all of them put together even after 30 years on the road.  Apparently Elton's management has adopted the Johnny Carson technique -- never invite anyone on the stage that can show you up. He didn't need any of them.  Even Billy Joel is starting to be a ""nebech."" This is Yiddish for a ""pain in the butt.""  Enough of Billy Joel already!
All in all this is a great DVD.  BUT --- who is the drummer that looks like Buddah ?  Is that Nigel Olsson ?  I can't believe it!  I bought Nigel's solo record on Rocket Records -- the one with the song ""Dancing Shoes.""  I thought the album was great.  If this Buddah-looking drummer is what Nigel looks like after 30 years -- Oy Vey!
A thrilling DVD by the most influential entertainer of this generation.  No question about it.
P.S.  The video ""I Want Love"" which is included on the DVD is an abomination.  Just shut off the screen and listen to the music.  The music, even though it sounds distant, is fine. Robert Downey, Jr...  He mouths the words to the song which Elton sings.  This is ludicrous.  I've never seen anyone lip-sync words to someone else's song.  How would Elton's voice come out of Downey's mouth ? Whoever came up with this idea should get a real job and leave video making to the professionals.",1014681600,,1819,4.3552238805970145
3503786,4,B00005J6V1,"A packed Madison Square Gardens, lots of great camera angles and Elton covers all his greatest hits.  His voice is still pretty good too, although he's now ducking and covering from most of those high notes.  It's a pretty good DVD and sounds fairly good on DTS so it's worth having BUT:
1.  Elton looks really plump and the camera angle on his face and hands is incredibly unflattering a lot of the time
2.  His band is very unsexy.  That may not mean much to some people but I find that it dilutes the excitement and energy of the overall show
3.  His guests are all terrible and superfluous except for Billy Joel.
4.  The footage looks awful.  It seems to have been shot on film (as opposed to video) which looks grainy and horribly transferred.",1014336000,,748,4.408759124087592
3503787,4,B00005J6V1,"I give this DVD four stars overall with 5 stars for sound and 2 for video. The DTS soundtrack I listened to is first rate. This multichannel recording is as good as a studio recording. All the hits are here and Elton sounds in fine voice ((although I think he gave up the high notes a while back). The backup is first rate. Now the video. It looks to me like a film transfer and a poor one at that. These days there is no excuse for not shooting these videos with High Definition cameras then transferring to DVD (ever see Randy Travis?). I actually found the video distracting at times. You might try getting the audio all set up first, then turn off your TV. Then listen to a great concert.",1014076800,,692,4.25
3503788,4,B00005J6V1,"The DVD version of this concert should have been released first along with a full length CD.  Last year's VHS and audio CD featuring only portions of the concert were a disappointment and frankly, a waste of money.  Seeing the concert on this DVD only gives Elton justice to the MSG performances and shows why he is such a wonderful performer.  Perhaps Elton's management should not have 'rushed' out last year's VHS and CD just to get it out in time for Christmas.",1013990400,,465,4.578313253012048

The show and the audience was great.  At the time I wish I could have seen it, but I am sure this DVD is close.
If you like Elton at all, get it!
If you don't like Elton - get it for the sound quality!  Audiophiles - This disk is great!  I have a 5 amp home theater system set up for great sound and I can play this at concert levels and it sounds wonderful!!  This is the benchmark in DVD's.",1013212800,,473,3.9368421052631577

The only thing I really missed here is ""Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatter's."" That aside this is a technically brilliant DVD in both audio and video. As for the performance, Elton was great, but I could have done without the guest stars. I would definetly recommend this to even a casual fan.",1013126400,,448,4.2823529411764705

3503794,5,B00005J6V1,"First, this concert was aired on broadcast TV.  Then, an abbreviated version of the concert was released on VHS.  Finally, ""Elton John: One Night Only - The Greatest Hits"" was released on DVD.  The two condensed versions made the concert feel like a ""Duets"" tour, given the number of duets compared to the number of solo songs.  The DVD version, which contains 27 songs, truly feels like a ""Greatest Hits"" concert, with the occasional guest vocalist joining in here and there.  Since the concert was performed in Madison Square Garden, Elton dedicated one of the songs to his dear, departed friend John Lennon.  This is the only concert performance I've ever seen of Elton doing the Beatles' classic ""Come Together.""  Elton is in top form throughout the entire show.  The concert ends on an emotional high point, his duet with Kiki Dee on the #1 song ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart.""  The song plays to the end and then the picture fades to black, without the end credits crawling along to ruin the mood.  You have to click on an option to see the end credits, as Elton's ""Song For Guy"" plays in the background.  As if that wasn't enough, the DVD has the bonus video of ""I Want Love"" featuring Robert Downey, Jr.  Finally, a full-length concert worthy of Elton John's talents is available on DVD.  I highly recommend it to all Elton John fans and to all fans of great music.",1011312000,80,1371,4.592592592592593
3503795,5,B00005J6V1,"Elton John used one of the most state-of-the-art audio recording equipment during this concert, and you can definitely hear the difference, especially in DTS 5.1.  I use a Bose Acoustimass 15 speaker system, and it produces very rich and vibrant audio from this DVD.  The video looks sketchy at best.  The close-ups were relatively clear (you can see the dust particle flying about on stage), but the longer shots are a bit blurry.  So you've got som inconsistencies with the video.
Elton plays 27 hits on this DVD, with some definitely rarer hits that he doesn't play normally:  ""Club at the End of the Street,"" ""Little Jeannie,"" ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart.""  Some true gems are ""Funeral for a Friend"" (with an extended solo at the end), ""I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That"" (with an awesome piano solo), ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" (with a huge standing ovation for Billy Joel, and ""Sad Songs"" (with Brian Adams).

The Dolby 5.1 tracks at the video shots were excellent, crystal clear and clearly a benchmark for concert videaos.....
Ironically, the name of the DVD is 'One Night Only' while in actuality it was shot over a two night perion in October 2000. With the energy and absolute electricty that Elton John puts into his performances it's amazing he did it in only  two nights. His singing was clear crisp and strong showing none of the age that other rockers his age may suffer. The back up as well was fab and the songs were so well mixed that the back up didn't drown out Elton Johns honkey tonk piano man skills at the ivories ....

First of all the decision to give the video direction to David Mallet, the most important video director. Any moment of the show is shoot with ""frame"" precision. A great standing ovation to the  audio engineer and the 5.1 mix. The DTS track is outstanding and for me is a reference for the past and the future musical DVDs. Is perfectly equilized and the subwoofer is present when is needed. The all 5 speakers works togheter to create the astonishing reverbering of the Madison Square Garden and seems to stay on front to the stage with thousands of guests around you.
Only the video compression is not at the level. The long shoot are affected by bad video compression (seen on my 3 meter base projector screen) and the video definition is poor. Seems to be a typical PAL to NTSC conversion but I am not sure of this.
