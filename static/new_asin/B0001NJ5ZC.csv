8015276,5,B0001NJ5ZC,"Mr. Wizard was the black and white nurturer of many future science boys AND girls. In an interview, he once said though he had kids of his own, he used actors and actresses because he couldn't fire his own children! Well rehearsed and clearly explicated, his show didn't just show you an amazing demonstration (a mistake some teachers trying to entice without informing make), but he explained what was happening and why it was happening through interactive Q&A with the young girl and boy joining him.
Look at this - 1956 - way ahead of Sputnik and the push for science education, Don Herbert was there. View it from an historical perspective, it's cool. Watch it for the science, it's still cool.
(For some reason, mine arrived with a DVD version, too, probably because VHS was heading the way of Beta, Super-8 and ASA10 Kodachrome I.)",1388102400,,837,4.739726027397261
8015277,1,B0001NJ5ZC,"this is an unauthorized, inferior quality DVD and not from the original Mr Wizard Studios - created by Don Herbert.
Go to [...] to find all authorized DVD's from Don Herbert himself.",1340582400,,182,4.71875
8015278,5,B0001NJ5ZC,Mr Wizard is the best science show for kids. The kids always ask to watch Mr. Wizard.  They tell me Beakman is boring and while they love Popular Mechanics for Kids - Mr. Wizard is everyone's favorite.,1331596800,,201,4.4324324324324325
8015279,5,B0001NJ5ZC,"""Watch Mr. Wizard"" was one of the first commercially successful educational-programs on United States television, airing on the NBC Television Network. There are three episodes of the series on this DVD. One is from 1954 and is about rocks. The 2nd and 3rd episode appear to be from the 60's, and are about electricity & the legs and speed of animals, respectively. These 3 episodes are very watchable and suprisingly entertaining for an old educational series aimed at children. I do hope that further old educational series come to DVD, including those made by the now-defunct NET (which later became the basis for PBS).

The forth item on this DVD is an episode of arguably the first truely interactive series ever aired on a major TV network. It's called ""Winky Dink and You"", and though it's of considerable historic interest as an example of innovative 50's TV, it's not very watchable as a program, and is the weakest aspect of this budget DVD (plus, it's in fairly poor condition, unlike the 3 ""Mr Wizard"" episodes, which look very good for their age).

Each of the 3 ""Mr Wizard"" episodes runs about 28 minutes, ""Winky Dink"" runs approx half-hour, though I don't remember the exact time.

Regardless, those interested in the history of television will find much to enjoy here, and yes, it does have considerable nostalgia value too.",1245196800,4,1340,4.868421052631579
8015280,5,B0001NJ5ZC,I enjoyed these three episodes and so did my 10 year old son.  The clear way Mr. Wizard explains and demonstrates the scientific principles is great.  I bought a copy of his book on Supermarket experiments on Amazon and my son spent days with funnels and cardboard and salt etc. making all kinds of fun experiments.  I learned that Mr. Wizard aka Don Herbert died in 2007 online at mrwizardstudios they also have additional DVD's available.,1202428800,,440,4.7631578947368425
