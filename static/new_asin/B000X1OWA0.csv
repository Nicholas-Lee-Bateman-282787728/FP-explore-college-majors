8446597,5,B000X1OWA0,"I have seen this documentary by Bo Landin long time ago. Its a good one. I do notice that they may clip away the confrontasion with the wolf pack in some countires.

Its a good documentary who shows the life to wolverines and how they survive in the tough clima they live in. These ""little"" critters are tough and misunderstood by the public in genral.

They are not ""beast"" but wild animals having a hard life..",1200355200,,412,4.407894736842105
