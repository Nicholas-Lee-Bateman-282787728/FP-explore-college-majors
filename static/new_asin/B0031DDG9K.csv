8386869,3,B0031DDG9K,"My son and I saw this in the store yesterday and it begins with episode 27.  I was wondering if the previous six volumes cover the episodes prior to this DVD. It seems kind of odd to label it ""Chapter One"" and have it begin so far into the series. It seems misleading.",1273968000,14,268,4.056603773584905
