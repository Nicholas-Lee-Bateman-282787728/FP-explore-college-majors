8391949,1,B00395ATMW,"saw this at a film festival and it was lovely. searched high and low, got a region-free dvd player for this because it supposedly had english subtitles. i popped it in, only to find it only had maybe 20% of the subtitles in place. completely useless. why not add all the subtitles to such a great film?  wish i could get money back. :(",1355270400,,335,4.234375
