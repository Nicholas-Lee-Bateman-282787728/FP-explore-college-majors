5731489,5,B00COQQ606,"This movie is the best to watch if you are interested in learning about exorcisms, hold on to your seat it might get a little scary for you and to even think this is reality.",1370736000,2,174,4.0
8584007,1,B00COQQ606,"Just awful, no reason to watch this. I'm not even sure I made it halfway before deciding my time was better spent on any other movie",1527292800,,132,4.115384615384615
8584008,1,B00COQQ606,"Gave up after 20 minutes. Slow moving, shallow characters, vacuous dialogue. Don't waste your time or money.",1518739200,,108,5.411764705882353

8584010,2,B00COQQ606,"This was possibly one of the worst ""exorcism"" movies I've seen...

Pros : concept was actually ""o...k..."" / having a scientist work with a priest is a nice touch

Cons : audio was awful / camera work was poor / acting sucked / random scenes that contribute nothing are spliced in throughout the movie / entire middle of the film just meanders along... / the end was absolutely mind-boggling and didn't explain anything... / for like a brief moment like 3/4 of the way in, I thought the movie was going to make sense, and then they just threw all of it out the window...

My advice...  don't waste your time",1510617600,2,606,4.4324324324324325
8584011,1,B00COQQ606,"This is all absolutely false. When I was possessed by Satan Himself, I had WAY more fun than these poor excuses of possessed people!",1499990400,,132,4.541666666666667
8584012,1,B00COQQ606,This is by far the most horrible movie I have ever seen. Biggest waste of money ever!,1447891200,,85,4.0588235294117645
8584013,2,B00COQQ606,"Exorcist Chronicles starts off flat. After a pretty nice credit roll the film just lingers on the first scene as quiet as the dead. A priest residing over someones bedside- I am assuming death bed because two more priests enter, only to mutter in a few short sentences,  declaring the priest Father Death. No reason is given and we are forced to just take their word for it and move on. Then just as blunt as the first scene plays out another scene begins with no real dialog or story lead to suggest why or where or anything really that would give any real depth to the situation. This seems to be the running premise throughout the film. Just a series of random scenes of characters that we are shown, with very little dialog, that actually give some understanding to their purpose within the story, or why we should even care! No arcs, no real guiding stream of consciousness that would validate the characters, or hook the storys themes together. All of this is only broken by scenes of various demonically possessed people. In a way that almost comes off as some type of Catholic compulsory  hording fetish of the possessed. Most of these almost surrealistic moments play out in grandiose artfilm fashion, that belong more in rock music videos than in movies. And sadly these little visual artistic experiences are really the only thing that  suggests any emotional involvement from the director or writers.

There is some dialog-dont get me wrong-the cast doesn't mime out the story. The dialog is just so short and unattached to the meat of the overall synopsis that it almost seems pointless. The characters are one dimensional and way under developed. It never goes deep or offers the details needed to prove the plot, or solidify the events that take place in the film. Mostly it is just basic banter about first person necessity or requirement like How long has this been happening? or Dont you believe in the presence of evil. Pray, pray, pray, blah, blah, blah. Even the exorcisms were weak and not fully visualized. I don't know what really happened with the film but it just seemed like one big carousel of randomness, hoping we understand that -everything is implied. It is like we jumped in in the middle of events, and only glimpsed small portions of what was happening, only to be thrown into another moment. Actually I think this may be the first film with British actors that was disappointing. The story wasn't in-depth or thought provoking-really didn't even seem smart. Even the characters seemed contrived and almost pointless. Not to mention that the acting was way below the standard UK talent pool-which really almost never happens, except for actors like Hugh Grant-they really fell flat. And a couple of characters where so unrealistic that it seemed ridiculous. The only real quality moments in the film came from the creative expressionism style, shown with the Vatican footage or flashes of demonically possessed characters. Set those to some Death Metal and you may just have something here.",1432598400,2,3025,4.845261121856867
8584014,2,B00COQQ606,"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

Guide: F-bomb. Nudity.",1419465600,3,1109,4.322115384615385
