3787323,5,B001STTRTC,"Even after all these 15 years, I still remember many great episodes from this singular series.  I believe it was the first season in which an unforgettable episode has Parker off of his game (nothing working for him as it did before), wherein wisdom from a maintenance man (of all people) puts Parker back on track (and can also do the same for we the viewers).  I won't reveal it's message here, but I assure you this episode and others have great fun, laughs, and other messages  (summing up much like Scrubs does so well today) that undscore the subtle brilliance of this fabulous TV series so far ahead of its time.",1112659200,5,619,4.508928571428571
3787324,5,B001STTRTC,"Parker Lewis was one of the great high school shows. It had a wry sense of humor and a high school kid point of view, with its exagerations and misproportions. Parker Lewis was medium cool. He and his buds stood against their evil principal, her special obedience helpers and his amoral kid sister. The scripts were good, the situations hilarious, and a good bit of creative camera work.

It's:

- a bit like Daria, but not quite as ""down""

- much sharper satirically than Saved By The Bell

- more focused on high school than Buffy

We loved it.",1110931200,4,546,4.474747474747475
3787325,5,B001STTRTC,"I decided to write a review for this show because I felt it needs more people to stand up for it! This was a great series that had tongue in cheek humor that never took itself seriously and always had fun! The show was much more clever in it's humor than many of it's comteporaries, but it had a way of portraying high school for the wild, craziness it can be and had me in stitches for practially every episode. I hope they release it soon because this is definitely a keeper!",1109116800,2,477,4.195652173913044

3787328,1,B001STTRTC,I think the tv show is great! My problem is the quality of the dvd`s. The dvd set is sealed so I expect new quality. When I played Disc 1 & 3 &4 they froze up & skipped scenes. The picture would get blurry then freeze. This would happen constantly! I also bought Season 2 at the same time. It is the same. I would not recommend buying either one of these as I feel like I threw my money away. I have thrown the dvd`s in the garbage!,1417651200,3,432,3.865168539325843

3787330,5,B001STTRTC,"I was a huge fan of this show as a teen.  (Even had a graphically obnoxious shirt I called my ""Parker Lewis shirt"".)  I think it's even funnier as an adult because there's a lot of ""I see what you did there"" jokes I obviously missed back then.

Point one:  The picture quality on mine is fine, but this is years after the people complaining about picture quality.  The SOUND though has a bit of a hiss, but this was filmed almost 25 years ago so give it some slack.

Point two:  I was about three episodes in before I realized:  This is Big Time Rush without the music.  I'm not going to make a big (time) sales pitch for them but if you like this sort of thing you can find a few episodes online to test drive before you buy.  (They're essentially the latest Monkees but actually funny.)",1397692800,,788,4.193333333333333
3787331,5,B001STTRTC,"In 1990, Fox was still a growing network that looked into airing fun, hip, creative and edgy shows from all walks of life. Debuting in the fall of '90, 'Parker Lewis Can't Lose' was definitely one of those shows that fit all those descriptions. It only lasted three seasons, but it made it's impact, and this debut season threw down the gauntlet.

'Parker Lewis' follows the life of the title character (Corin Nemec), and his two best buds. Mikey (William Jayne), the cool rebel with a rock and roll heart (and brain full of rock trivia), and Jerry (Troy Slaten), a nerdish type who has the abillity to pull anything out of his trenchcoat. They attend Santo Domingo High School, where they continuosly battle their arch nemesis, principal Grace Musso (Melanie Chartoff). Parker's Parents (Tim Stack, Anne Bloom), little sister Shelley (Maia Brewton), big, scary Larry Kubiac (Abraham Benrubi), and Musso's creepy right hand man Lemmer, (Taj Johnson), round out the cast.

The series was pretty much it's own person right from the start. It had a fresh and colorful approach, with it's odd camera angles, zippy editing, sound effects, movie parodies, and slang. It definitely had ""Ferris Bueller"" on the brain as an inspiration, but it was still clearly it's own beast. The ""Pilot"" episode, which featured two different actors as Parker's parnts (including Mary Ellen Trainor who would return to the role in season 2 and onward), did a good job of getting it's message across of what kind of show this was going to be, albeit still being a little rough around the edges. All the kinks were worked out and it was smooth sailing beginning after that. other stand out episodes here include ""Power Play"", where a new student rivals Parker; ""Saving Grace"" finds Parker and pals trying to get Ms. Musso her job back after getting fired, and her replacement is even worse; Parker and his buds find an underground radio station on campus in ""Radio Free Flamingo""; ""Heather The Class"" finds Shelly joining a Heathers-like club; ""Teens From A Mall"" has Parker and buds at, well, the mall. This is just the tip of the iceberg. 26 episodes of Parker coolness.

The special features are pretty good too. A documentary on the show that features crew and most of the cast members. Did Melanie Chartoff have better things to do? Her abscence definitely stands out. There are also a number of commentaries that are all entertaining lessons. What you get from the documentary and commentaries are people who obviously had a great time making the series, enjoy each other's company, and are aware of what a cool, groundbreaking show they were making.

In the end, ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"" is like no other. Sure, there are shows that have come since who all seem like relatives (""Malcolm In The Middle"", ""Scrubs""), but this was first and still the best. While many tend to make fun of the clothes, hair and colors, I love it. It had character, presence, and was fun when the world, entertainment and pop culture was supposed to be those things. Not the dull, drab world we live in now. We need more color back in the world. We need Parker Lewis.",1388966400,5,3126,4.77264325323475
3787332,5,B001STTRTC,"Hi:  My name is Jerry. I am a great fan of this series. I watched it when it first came out, and watch it still. The one thing I would really like to know is, who played all of the guitar riffs on the soundtrack. It is one of the main things that attracted me to the show, besides its hilarity. If anyone out there knows who played these riffs please contact me at poopdeck@surewest.net.  Thank you. I wrote this review mainly to find out who the artist was that played the guitar riffs during the show. But I would still like to say that this series is by far my most favorite of all, simply because of its genius in comedic value, sound effects, music, and some serious facts of life that are sometimes dished out.",1383091200,,716,4.218978102189781
3787333,5,B001STTRTC,"Came very quickly -- I asked them to post it ASAP and they posted it within a few hours.

3787334,5,B001STTRTC,I couldn't understand why I wanted to buy these series. But I still did. It has very good and unexpected insights and life lessons underneath the fun. :) It is actually a good buy and worth watching all over again.,1368748800,,214,4.375
3787335,4,B001STTRTC,"Its great to relive highschool years and remember the colourful life or Parker, Mikey and Jerry.

3787336,2,B001STTRTC,"I was SOO incredibly excited when I found Parker Lewis on Amazon! My boyfriend has been talking about how it was his favorite show ever since I met him, and it hasn't been easy to come by. So even though I read all the revews about the picture quality being poor, I snagged up seasons 1&2 as soon as I saw them. They were to be a gift to him on our 1st anniversary. I waited in eager anticipation, wiping anxious sweat from my brow in the difficult moments where I wanted to tell him what was coming in the mail. His reaction was priceless, and he ran for the dvd player...the picture quality is fine...its whats to be expected for a 1990 low budget sitcom. No problems there. But imagine my surprise, confusion, and then angry disbelief when the 1st dvd began to uncontrollaby skip during the last 3 episodes!! I thought ""There's NO way this brand new dvd can be scratched, its gotta be a finger print""...I was horrified at what I saw when I removed the disk from my player! Not only was the disk scratched multiple times, BUT the disk is stained! the stain is somehow set deep into the reflective plastic of the play side, and it makes 3 episodes entirely unwatchable! Then, as if in a bad dream, I looked at the second, third, and fourth disks... ALL STAINED in the same pattern even!! Are you KIDDING ME?! This was to be the best, most surprising gift I could give to make someone smile, and it ended up being even worse than no gift...because the other 3 disks won't play @all! So it is the biggest disappointment instead of the best gift. I'm too frightened to look @the disks for season 2 yet, but they came from the same distributor, so Im not holding my breath!",1334188800,7,1670,4.355769230769231
3787337,4,B001STTRTC,"""Parker Lewis Can't Lose: Season 1"" is a great teen comedy that's like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" crossed with ""Scrubs"". Parker Lewis, like Ferris, is a high school kid who's constantly pulling scams to make his life more enjoyable. Like ""Scrubs"", the humor comes from smart, surreal exaggeration. The plots center around high school life, such as chasing after girls. There's a great cast of characters, including the great and big Abraham Benrubi (loved him on ""ER"" and as Anya's husband turned troll on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""). Here in his first major role, he plays Kubiac, a force of nature that's not to be disturbed, especially during lunch. I love Kubiac, and I've been very happy that Benrubi has such a great career. ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"" is great escapist fun, especially if you're nostalgic about high school.",1326672000,,829,4.971223021582734
3787338,5,B001STTRTC,"Stumbled across this last week, and watched some episodes this weekend.  Still just as funny as I remember.  Used to meet with friends for pizza and PCLC on Sunday nights.  Now I will order extra copies to send them as gifts.  Highly recommend.  Enjoy!",1314489600,2,252,4.636363636363637
3787339,5,B001STTRTC,"When I was 10-12 years old, roughly, I used to get up every morning to watch the repeats of Parker Lewis Can't Lose on the USA Network in the summer when I was off school, having been too young during its original FOX run to properly enjoy it. Now that I'll be 29 this year and those days are long behind me, I wondered to see if this classic series would ever reach DVD, and finally it has. Not a problem.

For the most part, the series holds up in the funny department, even with its absurd concepts and dated dialogue and references -- this is, in my opinion, THE quintessential early '90s teen comedy TV series, and Shout Factory has done a marvelous job in bringing it to DVD for all of its nostalgic fans, loading it with commentaries, extras, and interviews with the cast and crew. If you've never seen the series, it's definitely worth a watch -- especially since Amazon has the first two seasons on sale so cheap.",1310342400,2,922,4.3604651162790695
3787340,5,B001STTRTC,"This is a TV spin-off of John Hughes movie ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Both NBC and Fox networks tried to cash in on this successful teenage movie into TV series; NBC failed, and Fox won in their bids to make successful TV versions. Parker Lewis Can't Lose became a huge success during the early days of Fox network and produced 26 episodes in the first season of its three year run. The story revolves around three teenage high school kids (The Buds); Parker Lewis (Corin Nemec), Mikey Randall (Billy Jayne) and Jerry Steiner (Troy Slaten) who handle day-to-day problems/setbacks as a team. Their adversaries are school Principal Ms. Grace Musso (Melanie Chartoff), school special helper Frank Lemmer (Taj Johnson), and Parker Lewis's sister Shelly Lewis (Maia Brewton), and occasionally school bully Larry Kubiac (a.k.a. Kube; Abraham Benrubi). In the episode ""Dj Dudes,"" the buds crashes in on the HS reunion of principal Musso, and Parker's dad and his buddies compete with Parker and his buds to prove who is cool. In the episode ""Radio free Flamingo"", the buds use the school pirated radio station to unwittingly turn against one another. Rent a Kube is a hilarious episode in which Larry is hired to prevent shop lifting in his parent's video store and produce unexpected events, when Larry arrests Parker's father for shoplifting. In the ""Human Grace"" episode, Parker fixes up Musso with Dr. Pankow, a fellow school teacher, and Weird Al Yankovich has a cameo. ""Parker Lewis Can't Win,"" ""King Kube,"" ""Citizen Kube"" and ""Heather the Class"" are some of the funniest episodes.

Character study of Grace Musso, Frank Lemmer and Parker Lewis suggest similarities to Major Margaret Houlihan, Frank Burns and Hawkeye of TV show MASH in terms of antagonistic interactions, but there is no romance between Musso and Lemmer. Corin Nemec, in the lead role does a wonderful job as a cool kid, and Melanie Chartoff as the bossy school principal, Abraham Benrubi as the school bully and Maia Brewton as a meddling sister have provided great performances. I was disappointed when this show was not nominated in the best series category for Emmy award during the first season. It is unfortunate that series went down hill in the third season as the creative content of the show failed. It turns out that first season is the best of the series and one of the top 10 shows of all time in my books.

3787341,5,B001STTRTC,There's always a concern that old favourites may not stand the test of time. Parker Lewis is just as good now as when I watched it back in the 1990's. I didn't realise Milla Jovovich was in it. The music is great. I'm so glad this classic has been preserved!,1259193600,,258,4.18
3787342,4,B001STTRTC,"for anyone who loves smart, surreal, fast-paced tv, this nostalgic gem of a set is a lovely investment (and for anyone who was not a teenager in 1990, prepare to discover a wonderfully weird world :)",1258675200,,199,4.555555555555555
3787343,4,B001STTRTC,"Some folks say Parker Lewis is basically a Ferris Bueller knockoff. It's hard to deny the show seems to have taken at least some inspiration from that film but, it should be noted, that ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" took place almost entirely outside of school whereas ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"" takes place almost entirely at school. That's a pretty major difference.

I watched this show with some regularity when it originally aired and enjoyed it quite a lot. Of course, it's hard to know how one will react to a show he last viewed at age 11. As it turns out, PLCL holds up remarkably well. The clothing, hair and myriad catchphrases feel a little dated and gratuitous at times, but none of that detracts from what is, overall, a remarkably well-written and very funny show.

It's hard to know how one who has never seen the show will react to it without the benefit of nostalgia, but I'd warrant they'd enjoy it quite a bit. The pop culture references are often unexpected and hilarious and anyone who doesn't develop a deep affection for the characters by the end of the first disc is one cold-hearted SOB.

I highly recommend this show and I'm ready for the second season.",1253923200,3,1176,4.617224880382775

3787347,5,B001STTRTC,"While I am watching this, I am struck by how the show reflected the hope of the early 1990s, that in that decade the page would be turned to a better era, but it all ended up with Monica Lewinsky, the Spice Girls, apathy, and lethargy. I can hear Corin Nemec doing a voice-over saying this in my mind. Then I think about how the show lost its edge a couple years later, and I would think ""whatever"" about the ones after Parker changed his hairstyle and the fun stuff was taken out of the show. And then I think of when this show first came on, and it was such a zinger that really was fun and expressive, which is never easy to come by. It's so thrilling that this has finally arrived.

Happy with my purchase but I thought they used too much compression.  It would have been worth paying a little more for an extra disc for better quality if they used less compression with fewer eps per disc.  If it was overly compressed to test the market, I hope the sales were more than expected and they release season 2 soon with better quality.

3787350,2,B001STTRTC,"It is a good show, if you are looking at this you already know what its about.  The only problem and it is a BIG problem is the quality of transfer to DVD.  It stinks, I had old copies of the show I had made on VHS while it was on TV and the quality of those after all these years of fading is about the same or better than the DVD quality.  When I first tried to watch it I thought my DVD player or TV was messed up, it was that bad.  The worst part of the movie are the times when they froze the image and continue on with the talking or audio, at those points you really see how bad the transfer was... frankly I would suggest passing on this one because of quality of the transfer alone.  Go look for a VHS copy of it and you'll find better quality than the DVD.  VERY VERY disappointed.",1248825600,20,791,3.8819875776397517
3787351,4,B001STTRTC,"....The cleverest show about teenagers since ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"". ""Parker Lewis"" was essentially our old friends, the ""Archie"" gang, in yet another slightly mutated form. There have been MANY steals from ol' Arch and his gang over the years: ""Dobie"", for one, ""Happy Days"", for another.... those feeble animated attempts during the seventies. ""Parker"" was, besides ""Dobie"", the most successful, I think.

It's obvious....Parker himself was ol' Arch, Mikey was Jughead, Jerry was an OBVIOUS Dilton, Kubiak an obvious Big Moose, Lemmer - Reggie AND Ms. Grundy, Musso - Veronica, Anny - Betty...and look in the old comic books...one of the favorite expressions of the writers was ""EEP!"", a favorite of ""Parker's"" writers as well, usually uttered by Jerry when he was scared to death, (and just before he put on a dust-cloud-leaving burst of speed.) But Parker went beyond the other ""Archie"" copiers in so many ways. ""Archie"" always strived to keep up with the times as far as youth culture and relevance was concerned, and ""Parker Lewis"" specialized in this. Gags were kept very current, and episode themes were treated likewise.

""Parker Lewis"" was one of a raft of shows Fox had on on Sunday night that didn't seem to have any equals on any other network, (except MAYBE ABC)! No one had shows to go up against ""Parker"" or ""In Living Color"", ""Married, With Children"", (although ""Roseanne"" came close there,) or ""The Simpsons"". Fox took this Sunday night and built it into the consistent top 20 ratings grabbing network it is today, and it's a shame kids get older and networks cancel shows, because if the cast of ""Parker"" hadn't aged, it would have been prudent to have kept it on Fox as long as they've had ""The Simpsons"".

There are commentaries on this disc for the shows involving the cast, including Parker himself, Corin Nemec; Taj Johnson, the actor who played Lemmer; Timothy Stack, Parker's dad; Kubiak, (Abraham Benrubi, looking like Moses,) Maeia Brewton (Shelley) and Troy Slaten, Parker's Dilton, Jerry....along with the ladies who played Parker's mom: Mary Ellen Trainor and Anne Bloom. I LOVED this show when it was on, and was always amazed at how clever and cheeky it was compared to other sitcoms. It was kind of the ""Moonlighting"" version of ""Happy Days"", with fourth wall-breaking, voice-over narration, and cartoonish sight gags that worked more often than not.

All I know is, I'm going to sit back, recall fond memories of my pals Parker, Mikey, Kube, Lemmer and bratty Shelley and enjoy seeing them carry on like they did between 19 and 16 years ago, when Fox was just an embryo.

BTW, oddly enough, as happens too often with star vehicles these days, ""Parker"" wasn't the vehicle that made Corin Nemec, the star of the show....the person who benefited most from being on the show? Abraham Benrubi!! Kubiak! He hasn't STOPPED working since the show was canceled! Nemec showed up on ONE episode of ""Smallville"" and had a running role on ""Stargate: SG1"" for a while. Billy Jayne, Troy Slaten and Taj Johnson never pop up anywhere....and I've been keeping my eye out. Mary Ellen Trainor doesn't work anymore, either, and she was hot as a pistol after ""Romancing the Stone""! Timothy Stack is another cast member that gets a lot of work.

Why is it supporting actors always get the work from being in these things and the stars pretty much kiss their careers goodbye?? ""Star Wars"", ""Amadeus"" and ""Married With Children"" (Ed O'Neill doesn't get ANYTHING, but Katey Segal and Christina Applegate can't stay OFF of TV!) are perfect examples of vehicles where this has happened!

I'll always be mystified by this! But anyway....""Parker Lewis"", as they say, can't lose....and neither does this collection of 1st season episodes!

3787352,4,B001STTRTC,"As everybody should know already, this is a great show that really deserves to be finally released on DVD. It's great fun to watch and wakes feelings of nostalgia.

The extras are quite nice, too. You get a half hour documentary with all members of the cast (except Melanie Chartoff, sadly) and the producers. Then there's audio commentaries for selected episodes, also with cast members, producers and directors. It's really interesting to watch and listen to.

There's only one disappointment with this release: The picture quality is very bad. There is a lot of blur, grain and sometimes even vertical lines. ALF and Full House, for example, have much better video quality on their DVD releases - and those shows were video taped, Parker Lewis was filmed on 16mm.

In conclusion it's still a great release - but only 4 stars because of bad video quality.",1248652800,4,857,4.8561643835616435

There is no brief description of the show itself, though. It was, and thanks to SHOUT (we need ALL the shows! Shout make more now?) is again, proof that G-rated television can be funny, dramatic, sweet, serious, charming, hilarious, and most excellently crafted from start to finish while tenderly delivering very real and vital messages about love, loyalty, growing up and life in general.

While I have enjoyed several other series in their times, and some have humor that has endured through several generations, Parker Lewis Can't Lose is the most unique of all.
The actors were all brilliant and perfectly cast. The direction, lighting, colors, action, effects and timing were impeccable. It's not just a pleasure to watch, but to study!
 A few years ago I fell victim to purchasing ""all the episodes"" on VHS, only to find they were bootleg and mostly unwatchable. I was crushed.
I found myself looking all over the Internet for clues as to who owned the rights and why wasn't this show available for sale when so much lousy ""entertainment"" filled the shelves! I wrote to Sony and begged them to release the series on DVD. No reply. (I didn't expect one.) As a last resort, I posted the title here on Amazon in a ""wish list"" just in case SOMEone came out with a kosher copy.
FINALLY it happened, and we are so grateful. We promise we will purchase the rest of the series as soon as you publish them; we want them all.
There was never a bad episode. There were and are many favorites, but never a bad one, never an unwatchable or boring one.
Each show is a gem unto itself.
Thank you, everyone involved with the Creation of ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"", and the new releases on DVD. We've waited for you for 19 years.",1247270400,5,1845,4.621951219512195

It was hugely influential and cutting edge way ahead of it's time, only to be known and appreciated by a dedicated following.  So many clever and now even commonplace techniques were used in this show.  Every time I see Scrubs I see the shots, sound and visual effects and whatnot that Parker Lewis Can't Lose used... and a good 13 years earlier!  Surprisingly the show holds up well and a friend who had never seen it is now hooked and rapidly flying through season 1.  For those who haven't seen it, think Ferris meets 3 O'clock High.

You can be secure showing it to your 10-year-old with no worries as to inappropriate content. The writing is incredible. The characters are perfect. The camera angles, the sound effects, and the soundtrack, especially the soulfull guitar riffs...oh man, it just makes me so happy!

What a great show, even after almost 20 years it still holds up. You can see very clearly where ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""Scrubs"" got their cues.

I also enjoyed the commentaries, some are from the creators with more background info on how the show came to be and was made, and others are from the cast with fond memories of the shooting. I did not get to the documentary, yet.

The picture quality is not as good as today's shows, but that is understandable. This was shot on 16mm and then edited on a non-AVID video editing system in the early 90ies. There is considerable film grain in some scenes, and video ringing in some of the titles. But overall, the quality is good, and does not distract from the great content.

This series IS what the Ferris Beuler TV show was TRYING to be....remember THAT train wreck??  Sheesh...  Anyways, I was reading a few of the reviews & I agree with all of them, but one comment in particular stood out.  Somebody said the real star was the sound effects which punctuated an event or statement...Kubiak walking thru the halls (boom, boom, boom), the nerd always pulling something from his trench coat (sound of velcro peeling) crazy stuff like that.

Maia Brewton as Parker's younger sister Shelly ranks up there with Danielle Spencer's Dee Thomas from What's Happening as the kid sister from Hell and steals every scene she's in.

But whatever happened to Taj Johnson, who played Frank Lemmer? He seems to have disappeared (or make that teleported) from the business. Hopefully, Shout will have a lot of great supplemental material with the whole cast.

This was a direct slam at the attempted copycat show ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" which wasn't funny at all (unlike the brilliant movie).

If you've not seen it yet, prepare to get hooked - this show is extremely addictive. Parker Lewis - a High School genius, not by books; but by creativity has a way out of every situation he gets himself into thanks to the ""Musso excuse files"" kept safely hidden on a football sized rolodex in Steiner overcoat. Meanwhile Mikey, has the knack for finding trouble, actually they all do; the 3 Tenors of high school sheningans and pranks. The principle Grace Musso, and her able assistant Frank Lemmer - who's official title as Special Obedience Helper steal nearly every scene. This is the show to escape into non-reality and just enjoy yourself. No big message here, just straight up entertainment. The cast is classic casting, everyone here belongs on this show and you will learn all about everyone important to the cast in the very first episode. And you will immediately be hooked. But the biggest star of this comedy series wasn't the cast, it was the special affects. This show was so ahead of it's time, the sounds and visuals, strange camara angles, Musso's ""unopposeable thumb,"" the sound of Kubiaks 300 pounds walking thru the hallways of Santo Domingo High; nothing I write here will do justice for the genius of creativity this show had.

The ""Ferris Buehler"" TV show ran from 1990 to 1991 and failed.  In fact, in classic Parker Lewis style, there is a episode where the last scene ends and the camera pulls back from the stage, further and further, until we see two young men sitting in the back in folding chairs.  One of them whispers to the other something like ""So THAT'S how they do it!"".  This was an obvious swipe at the awful and unfunny ""Ferris Buehler"" TV show (Jennifer Aniston was in that show!) that tried to compete with Parker Lewis.

Anyway, this was one of the great cutting-edge sit-coms of it's time.  There was a great chemistry between the actors.  I loved Melanie Chartoff as Principal Grace Musso.  Hottest principal ever!

3787407,5,B001STTRTC,"Season 1 of Parker Lewis Can't Lose is currently rerunning on the Toonami channel in the UK.

15 years after I first saw the show, I am consistently reminded of its brilliance by these reruns.

Everything about it, the writing, the direction and especially the acting is absolutely spot on.

Corin Nemec, Billy Jayne and Troy Slaten are as near to TV perfect as I have seen as the leading characters and the supporting cast is fantastic, though I wonder whatever happened to Taj Johnson, anyone know?

My reaction to this coming out on DVD would be just....coolness!

If Saved By The Bell, Punky Brewster, etc. can be released, why not this?  This easily beats them all, hands down.

I've been waiting for a dvd to be released ever since because I would love to see the original version and not just the synchro.

I have been waiting for DVDs for Parker Lewis can't Lose since the DVD was invented.  [not really, I do have a life.]

However, this was one of the most clever and creative shows on TV.  Just like your emotions when you were in highschool, everything was larger than life, painfully intense, time and distance telescoped [but that was a camera trick.]

C'mon Fox!  Get with it!  We want to relive the 90's!",1123200000,6,470,4.578313253012048
3787422,5,B001STTRTC,"""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"" was a funny, creative, unforgettable show, and it really needs to be on DVD.  ""Eerie, Indiana"" was another great ""kids"" show that did make it to DVD, so let's hope ""Parker"" follows suit.  I agree with the other reviewers; Seasons 1 & 2 were the best; in Season 3 they tried way too hard to be ""relevant"" and dropped the exaggerated sound effects and camera tricks that made the show so funny in the first place.  Plus, they gave Parker a girlfriend named ""Annie"" who looked like she was 25 years old!  I would definately buy the first two seasons on DVD though.",1122508800,3,587,4.457943925233645
3787423,5,B001STTRTC,"This is a TV spin-off of John Hughes movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Both NBC and Fox networks tried to cash in on this successful teenage movie into TV series; NBC failed, and Fox won in their bids to make successful TV versions. Parker Lewis Can't Lose became a huge success during the early days of the network and produced 26 episodes in the first season of its three year run. The story revolves around three teenage high school kids (The Buds); Parker Lewis (Corin Nemec), Mikey Randall (Billy Jayne) and Jerry Steiner (Troy Slaten) who handle day-to-day problems/setbacks as a team. Their adversaries are school Principal Ms. Grace Musso (Melanie Chartoff), school special helper Frank Lemmer (Taj Johnson), and Parker Lewis's sister Shelly (Maia Brewton), and occasionally school bully Larry Kubiac (Abraham Benrubi). In the episode, Deja Dudes, the buds crashes in on the reunion of principal Musso and the near disaster regarding the time capsule is averted by timely intervention of his dad. In Radio free Flamingo, the buds use the school pirated radio station to unwittingly turn against one another. Rent a Kube is a hilarious episode in which Larry is hired to prevent shop lifting in his parent's video store and produce unexpected events, when Larry arrests Parker's father for shoplifting. In the Human Grace, Parker fixes up Musso with Dr. Pankow, a fellow school teacher, and Weird Al Yankovich has a cameo. Parker Lewis Can't Win, King Kube, and Heather the Class are some of the funniest episodes.

Character study of Grace Musso, Frank Lemmer and Parker Lewis suggest similarities to Major Margaret Houlihan, Frank Burns and Hawkeye of TV show MASH in terms of antagonistic interactions, but there is no romance between Musso and Lemmer. Corin Nemec, in the lead role does a wonderful job as a cool kid, and Melanie Chartoff as the bossy school principal, Abraham Benrubi as the school bully and Maia Brewton as a meddling sister have provided great performances. It is unfortunate that series went down hill in the third season as the creative content of the show failed. It turns out that first season is the best of the series and one of the top 10 shows of all time in my books.",1122508800,22,2205,4.88
