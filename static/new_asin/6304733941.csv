7878623,5,6304733941,"""In the Shadow of the Reich: Nazi Medicine"" is a 60-minute documentary by Professor John J. Michalczyk, Director of Film Studies at Boston College, made in 1997, which was the 50th anniversary of the Nuremberg Physicians Trial, which was held from December 1946 to August 1947.  Michalczyk went to the Auschwitz and Majdanek concentration camps to interview both survivors of the Nazi experimentations and leader scholars who studied the practices of Nazi medicine such as Dr. Michael Grodin, Dr. Charles Roland, and Professor Michael Kater.  There is also an interview done at Auschwitz in 1995 with Hans Munch, a former S.S. doctor in this video, which is narrated by Donald Winning.
The film begins by examining how not only Germany but also the United States were interested at the start of the 20th century in eugenics as an example of a scientific Social Darwinism.  In the U.S. eugenic studies were being funded by Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockerfeller and over half the states had sterilization laws on the books at one point.  However, it was the Nazis in the 1930s who then put the theoretical work done by American scientist into practice in the Third Reich, beginning with the Nuremberg Laws excluded Jews from various professions, including the practice of medicine.  It was doctors in Nazi Germany who pushed for the state-sponsored program of ""racial hygiene,"" which meant the forced euthanasia of almost a half-million citizens with mental and physical defects.  In the death camps these physicians engaged in many experiments with questionable scientific merit and clearly no moral accountability.  This included studies of how much gas would be needed to kill a certain number of prisoners as quickly as possible and high-altitude testing that ruined the lungs of the ""subjects.""

""Nazi Medicine"" chronicles the path of these scientists, who began providing justification for the Nuremberg sterilization laws, the practice of euthanasia, and eventually to genocide.  What is both fascinating and horrifying about this documentary is that what the Nazis did was not simply follow orders from Hitler and his bureaucrats.  These physicians were integrally involved in all of these decisions, from developing the Nazi race laws to the unethical experiments conducted in the death camps.  Michalczyk also makes the point that after the Nuremberg Trial of those Nazi doctors, 10 international tenets of acceptable experimentation were established, including, most importantly, the informed consent of the subject.
This is a graphic documentary, and even those who have seen footage of the Holocaust are going to find this video upsetting.  But, as the quote from Allan A. Ryan, Director, U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Special Investigations points out on the front cover: ""The horror of Nazi eugenics and experimentation"" make this documentary ""a work of truth and timeliness.""",1083974400,3,2900,5.294117647058823
