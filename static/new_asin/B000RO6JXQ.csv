2869856,5,B000RO6JXQ,The video is Garfield (what more can I say).  The animal is really cute and my son loves it.  It's about the size of my hand so it fits well in his hands.,1234828800,,154,3.6363636363636362
2869857,4,B000RO6JXQ,"My son loved this gift, plain and simple.  We also purchased an extra one for his friend as a birthday gift and the result was the same.  The key to making this DVD extra special is the little stuffed animal that comes with it.  It is a very nice touch, especially when used as a gift. Who would have thought that a stupid old cat would be such a hit with 8 and 9 year olds.",1222128000,,374,3.8947368421052633
2869858,5,B000RO6JXQ,"Let's see, currently on Amazon, the DVD, Garfield: Dreams and Schemes, is selling for $9.98, and this is selling for $7.49, WITH the Pooky plush toy.  Hmmm...this is a tough decision folks...

I was thrilled when I saw this...  As you can tell by my name, I like Pooky just a tad... This little plush toy is very cute!  I added it to my collection, and couldn't be happier.  I haven't watched all of the DVDs in the Garfield collection, but I almost 100% certain that the cartoons on this DVD are repeats from the main set...  I probably wouldn't have purchased this if it didn't come with the Pooky plush, but I am glad to have it none-the-less.",1198454400,2,646,4.38655462184874
2869859,5,B000RO6JXQ,"My daughter loves this DVD and expecially the Pooky toy.  The Pooky toy is softer than I had expected and is great.  The DVD is of mostly Garfield's dreams and were alot that we had already seen on the Garfield season 1 and 2 DVDs, but there were also some that we hadn't seen.  However, it is good to have the dreams and schemes grouped together like that.  I would definitly recommend this product if you love Garfield and Pooky (of course).",1194566400,3,443,4.365853658536586

8201581,4,B000RO6JXQ,"I love this show; I used to watch it all the time as a kid. I still think Lorenzo as the voice of Garfield was by far the best. This is a summary of shows from the series Garfield and Friends.

Beware if you already own the tv series on dvd, however. These are taken directly from the series, so you are basically just having the convenience of skipping directly to the garfield cartoon from the US Acres cartoons and the shorts.  It is different than the ode to odie and ode to garfield sets which are also taken from the tv series, however.

I'm a fan and the price was still nice for me to own this summary dvd and the tiny beanie baby pookie, but stay away otherwise.",1262390400,3,671,4.1461538461538465
