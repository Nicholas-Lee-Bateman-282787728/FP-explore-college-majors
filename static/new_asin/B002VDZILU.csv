3994362,4,B002VDZILU,"Hidamari Sketch can easily draw comparisons to other shows like Azumanga Daioh, Doki Doki, and Lucky Star.  Like some of those, it's also based on 4 frame comics, and due to that, it's stories are brief and tend to jump around quite frequently.

But that's where the fun lies.  The show is incredibly random.  The days don't even play in chronological order.  Each episode is a single day in the life of four art students living in the Hidamari Apartments.  Several episodes focus around very simple things, like making artwork for the fair, or preparing a name plate for their building.

Basically, this show is the anime equivalent of Sienfeld (if Sienfeld was about teenage art school students.)  There is never a lot going on.  There isn't some great over reaching ark, like so many other series.  It's a nice, fun slice of life series, with some really well placed comedy.

Also, the show is incredibly stylish, courtesy of Shaft.  Real life objects are often inserted into the show, such as teddy bear, paint brushes, and even food.  The backgrounds are often ""dotted"" to mimic those in old comics.  Like most Sentai releases, these DVD's are well made and feature very good video quality, allowing you to enjoy the show fully.

If you're a fan of Azumanga Daioh, Doki Doki School Hours, or Lucky Star, then give Hidamari Sketch a try.  It's a fun show, and one you just might find yourself enjoying.

This release features the entire first season and 2 OVAs.

Ignore the comments about the video quality below.  I watched this on  40"" and 46"" TVs and the video quality was fine.  6 episodes per disc is less than 2.5 hours and since when do see a movie that length divided onto two discs?  I've also read several reviews of this that have all stated the video quality is fine and that there is no digital blocking.  Though sometimes certain DVDs will play and look better on certain setups, as opposed to others.  This DVD does have the potential, like most, to look bad if you have a cheap upconvert DVD player, or don't upconvert at all before watching it on such a large setup.  The Video quality may not be as crisp as a Japanese release, or even ADV's old singles, but it's certainly much, much better than the discs from Funimation.

Also, just because the Japanese discs looked okay, or the illegal uploads of this series looked okay, it doesn't mean that they masters that Sentai got would have been okay.  Both ADV and Funimation initially got bum masters for the Full Metal Panic series, even though the Japanese series looked okay.  They don't just shipped over the exact materials the Japanese release used.  They make a copy and then ship those.  There are many, many cases of the Japanese sending over very poor masters.  Unfortunately, the R1 companies always get blamed for this.",1264723200,14,2802,4.668711656441718
8381949,5,B002VDZILU,"Hidamari Sketch is such a silly and charming series. In these fourteen episodes, you'll find nothing exciting, but plenty of charming day-to-day occurences in the lives of Yuno, Miyako, Hiro and Sae. The show is very quirky, true to Shaft's reputation. If you liked Madoka Magica, Hidamari Sketch's same staff will surely rope you in.",1433894400,,334,5.090909090909091

8381953,5,B002VDZILU,"Four schoolgirls live in a small apartment building across the street from their school, where they are all studying art.  even though they each have their own apartment, they often share meals and adventures as they work their way through the school year.  four distinct characters (the newbie, the wacky friend, the motherly one and the mature one) that play off of and compliment each other.  the sequel series, Hidamari Honeys, is just as fun with the addition of two new students to the building.  other characters include their supportive landlady, their brilliant (but flighty) cosplaying teacher, and the constantly trembling principal, who always manages to surprise everyone with his wisdom and hidden talents.  if you are in a sad mood, just watch a few episodes.  it's a real cure for the blues.",1380931200,,807,5.030075187969925
8381954,5,B002VDZILU,"This is a sweet, funny and alarmingly addictive series about girls in art school. The characters are what makes it shine, as is the case in many such series. the humor comes naturally from their foibles.

It was surprising that there was no English track, but I didn't really miss it.",1373068800,,284,4.568627450980392

8381956,3,B002VDZILU,"It really, truly pains me to give the first season of Hidamari Sketch a mere three stars. This is perhaps my single favorite anime of all time, an one of a very few anime that I've wanted to watch more than once. (Further below I'll explain why I didn't give this product a full five stars.)

Hidamari Sketch is a rare, fantastic show that makes something pleasing to watch while having absolutely nothing like actual storytelling. Each episode is merely a collection of events about high-school art students and their daily routine. There's no real character arcs, no serious drama, and only light-hearted humor. We can't call Hidamari Sketch ""good storytelling"" because there's not any solid story being told. This show is primarily about absolutely nothing. So, what makes it so enjoyable?

Hidamari Sketch isn't about unfolding a dramatic tale. Instead, it's more like a mental and emotional massage. The characters are teeth-rottingly cute, the visual design is colorful and wonderfully creative, the humor is giggle-inducing, and there is some excellent music. I love this anime so much not because it's a good story, but because it balms the weary soul battered by the cruel real world. (Those of you who work and/or go to school will know what I mean.)

Now, that all said, I'll explain why I only gave this DVD set 3 stars. I love Hidamari Sketch, but this North American DVD release really leaves some things to be desired. It's not outright BAD, and there are one or two points that need praising. Let's list each noteworthy item one at a time.

The Good:
1. THIS DVD RELEASE DOES NOT HAVE ENGLISH DUBBED VOICE ACTING. To some, this might be a bad thing, but those ""some"" need to grow up and learn how to read. English voice tracks in anime are never, EVER a good thing. They always have bad actors who sound not even remotely like the Japanese originals, and their crappy performances break immersion worse than a hammer to the head. I'm utterly thrilled that the localizer of Hidamari Sketch in this DVD set left out the English voice track. Instead, they included the Japanese vocals only, and have English subtitles on by default. This is a very, very, VERY good thing.

2. I really appreciate most of the translation decisions that the localizing company made in writing the subtitles. They're all pretty much written with the assumption that the viewer will have some basic knowledge of Japanese linguistics and culture (Which is true of any American anime fan who buys a DVD set with no English audio track, so it was the right thing to do), therefore making the subtitles mostly accurate of what the original Japanese voice actors were saying.

The Bad:
1. As another Reviewer on this Amazon page mentioned, the video quality really leaves something to be desired. It's not unwatchably bad, but too often are there frames with fuzziness and blocking, making the DVD's video stream look decidedly poor. The video quality looks nearly identical to the original TV broadcast, which makes me think that was simply the quality of the source material from SHAFT (the studio that animated Hidamari Sketch). If that's true, then it's not the localizer's fault that the video is low-quality, but still. When you buy a DVD, you usually expect a BETTER quality copy than what broadcasted on TV.

2. The subtitles sometimes have typos, like missing letters or misspelled words. It's never bad enough that I can't understand what the characters are saying, but this is really an unacceptable flaw. Your subtitles should not have typos. Get an editor, do a second draft, just don't let that happen.

That's why, overall, this product gets 3 stars from me. I love Hidamari Sketch, and this DVD release is a just-barely acceptable archive of a great show. It is worth getting only if you really, REALLY like this show (as I do).",1293840000,6,3831,4.820395738203957
8381957,5,B002VDZILU,"One of the main reasons I'm posting this review is to offset the person who gave a 2-star ranking based on packaging and playability and not the program.  Grrr.

One of my favourite anime types that I seek out is comedy based off of Japanese 4 panel comic artwork (yonkoma); Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, K-On!, GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class, et cetera.  I like the jumpy randomness, the nonchronological stories... especially for repeat watching.  You're not following over-ly complex story arcs. Although all of these shows tend to take you through the three years of high school, this series is extra special that the story is completely out of sequence based on months.  I enjoy piecing the story together or my brain doing it for me.

The characters are quite appealing, especially the spazz Miyako; I hope Sentai eventually releases the 3rd season.",1292544000,,853,4.93006993006993
8381958,2,B002VDZILU,"First of all about the anime itself:

Yuno has just begun school where she always wanted, Yamabuki High School. She moves out and into an apartment by herself in a complex called Hidamari-so, which is right in front of the school. There, she meets a classmate, Miyako, and a senior student, Hiro. Yuno's days become hectic as she begins meeting the strange artists that live in her complex. Although she's not used to her new life style, she begins to actualize her dream while being with these gentle friends. [this time its from AnimeNFO] What we have here is a light comedy which plays in a school setting but with the difference that we have here not the regular every-day school but a art school. This remind maybe a bit on stuff like Honey & Clover but its only focused on comedy. There is no romance stuff or drama at all, but the kowing viewer might find also some lil parodies on other animes like PaniPoni Dash or even on Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. But even without this knowlage u can enjoy this one as its not a parodie anime that needs lots of knowlage from other animes like for example Lucky Star. The whole series concentrate on the funny everyday life of the four girls and their friendship. Also quite funny is their teacher which have a cosplay complex but always deny that she do cosplay, desprite she says that its just cause she wants it. In some ways she is a bit childish and often gets punished for her weird ideas but all that add just another fun point to the whole thing. This anime can perfectly watched aside as something for relax and laugh. With 12 episodes and 2 specials its not too short or too long.

And now why I rate the box that get sold here so bad:
When I got this box I was happy, but already when I unpacked it and saw it had only 2 discs (I preordered so I didn't know how many media we probably would get) I got curious. Finally when I put it into my player I got really disappointed since it had a such bad quality (good visible blocks regular in the episodes) and they even dared to put on trailers on the disc and so even more lowered the space available for the episodes. They rather should have given us 4 discs, especially since most of us today have big screens (32 inches and more), so even better can see bad quality. And its not the source thats so bad, I saw rips from the TV and japanese dvds. All together its sad to get this quality these days, and I kinda regret buying this boxset. I hope if they ever release Hidamari x365 they do MUCH better.",1266019200,16,2505,4.316348195329087
