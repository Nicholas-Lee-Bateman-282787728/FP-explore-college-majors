2844227,4,B000QUU7LQ,"This is just a slimline repackage of movies already available by Paramount on DVD from the King , Elvis Presley.  If you don't own them its a handy way to get them in one pop...but it could be a bit cheaper when you consider NON of these movies sells for more than $10 new in its own case etc...which Is why I am deducting a star.  If you can pick it up at Costco for $44 its a much better deal. Nothing has been done to upgrade the quality of the movie presentations from previous editions.

fun / stupid movies with Elvis dancing and singing..and ONE GREAT MOVIE...perhaps his best..King Creole.  Girls Girls Girls features the always worth watching Stella Stevens, and GI Blues has its moments. most of the rest are nice traveloges....from Mexico to Hawaii..",1186531200,20,761,4.532846715328467

2844292,5,B000QUU7LQ,"Bought as a gift for my Daughter. She loves them. Because of me, she was brought up listening to Elvis. These Elvis Movies are all in Widescreen format. As I told my Daughter, I'll probably be putting another set together for myself. I have a lot of the Elvis DVD's but some if not most of them are in the older format, so I see the picture in the middle of the screen with black on each side. I liked that these were widescreen format.

Between this set, the Elvis 75th Anniversary DVD Collection (17 Movies) and another, I was able to get 32 of his 33 movies. The only one my Daughter doesn't have now is ""Loving You"", one of my favorites, so I'll keep watching for that release.

All in all, these boxed sets are great way to start, add too, or complete an Elvis Movie Collection. Packaging is attractive and convenient, so they don't take up a lot of room for storage. Very nice to have and as mentioned, I'll be getting a set for myself as well.",1429056000,3,950,4.2430939226519335

2844377,5,B000QUU7LQ,"I purchased this set for a friend who absolutely LOVES Elvis and I consider it money well spent.  The main reason I got it was because King Creole is her favorite and I had trouble finding it on DVD.  I was fortunate to get this when it was on sale, but i would have paid full price for it after seeing it when it arrived.  It comes in a blue box which is so soft and immediately made me think of Blue Suede!  All in all, it looks so sharp, and it is a fabulous collection of Elvis movies.  I definitely recommend this set!",1328659200,,523,3.9903846153846154

I had to use one of my an old jacket from an obsolete dvd I had to store the loose dvd in a secure manner.",1325548800,,339,3.927536231884058

2844421,3,B000QUU7LQ,"I finally received my package after waiting one long month, was advised that delivery might take until the 16th, which would have been twenty two days from time of order, but did not arrive by then so notified the seller.  Was advised to wait another week, did so but did not arrive at that time which was now twenty nine days from time of order.  Again wrote to the seller with the response being a cut and paster advising of the USPS tracking number, then when I replied to that email, received an email advising of someone else's order information.  Left the house to go shopping and was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that my package had finally arrived.  Plastic wrapping covering the exterior of the velvet case was torn, however velvet box was not damaged so I am happy with the finally disposition.  Shipping method is ridiculously slow considering shipping priority would have cost about the same and would have arrived in two days.  However price for Lights! Camera! Elvis! Collection was well worth the wait as it was way less then other sellers were asking and the seller was responsive to my inquiries and did respond within a day or two.",1316908800,3,1159,4.684729064039409

It comes in a very nice case, that reminds me of blue suede!!!",1315008000,,127,4.12
2844425,5,B000QUU7LQ,"I've always enjoyed seeing Elvis movies every so often and here is a superb collection. The conversion of the movies to DVD was good and seemed without any flaws. Each movie is pressed onto it's own individual DVD. 2 DVD movies per case, 4 cases and 8 movies. The velvet outer case is a nice touch.

You can't go wrong with this collection. I wish they had another version with some of his other movies. After looking over all of the movies made by Elvis I didn't really realize he was churning them out that fast! I chose this collection too, because it has been many years that I have seen ANY of these movies from this collection.",1312502400,,633,4.364406779661017

2844450,4,B000QUU7LQ,"The item shipment took a little longer than expected, but I'm sure the timing with the Christmas holiday was the reason.  The Package cover,( where the titles of the movies are) is torn off under the plastic wrap. Made us wonder if it had been opened and then re-wrapped. Since this was a gift, I was a little dissappointed that the wrapper was damaged like that. Truthfully, my husband has not opened this gift yet, but I am sure (hopeful) that everything is fine with the DVDs.  Thank  you",1294876800,,491,4.49438202247191

2844456,5,B000QUU7LQ,"Paramount has a new box set out on Elvis and its called Lights! Camera! Elvis! Collection The movies you will receive is (Blue Hawaii/Easy Come, Easy Go/Fun in Acapulco/G.I. Blues/Girls! Girls! Girls!/King Creole/Roustabout/Paradise Hawaiian Style).  There are 4 thin cases in the box with two DVD's of Elvis' movies.  If you don't like the 2 movies in one case deal, then you can buy them individually.  As a collector, I love to put my Elvis Movies in Chronological order.  So this type of packaging kind of cramps my style.  But at the same time this box set is a cool way to collect a good bit of Elvis movies at one time.  The only thing that is  negative I can say about this box set which has the same issues as the individual DVD's you can buy,  is the Disc are the same artwork on the 2000 releases.  The graphic and font on the disc don't match with the 2007 cases, but the cases are much better and it has a darker, colorful, and creative look to them.  I would buy this Box set if they threw in a Bonus disc of cool documentaries or great movie performances. Another reason would be that I would love to have to this cool blue suede box set.  Meanwhile, I'll enjoy my 2007 individual remastered Elvis movies from Paramount.  The Artwork of Elvis is bigger and I can go back to putting them in Chronological order.",1188518400,32,1325,4.407407407407407
