1256942,3,B000035P86,"Cheesy, Hokey Story. I like monster movies but this only has a few good scenes but it could have been much better. The special effects seemed low budget.. the crock looked real but just put in the scene like in the old  Sinbad movies. I won't ever buy this on DVD...",947548800,3,266,4.215686274509804
1256943,2,B000035P86,"This movie is complete trash. Don't go out of you way at all to see this. There is nothing entertaining in it except maybe a couple of interesting scenes containing gore. One scene the aligator jumps along the side of the  boat. When the water settles you see the deputy has no head anymore, it was  cleanly taken of at the neck. I gave it two stars only because it had  decent visuals. Do not see this. If you want to see a horror mutant animal  movie go see Deep Blue Sea or ANY others, just not this piece of garbage.  Let's see if this review pisses any lake placid fan off.",947376000,5,578,4.125
1256944,5,B000035P86,"Fonda has never been better, absoltuly poker faced while delivering the sharpest lines in any movie this year.  The sarcasm and wit bite much harder then the giant croc and the laughs keep piling up.  If you are  looking for a scare, don't even begin to bother with this, if however you  are into a sort of parody of the typical Jaws rip off......with a  cracklingly funny script - this is absolutely it.  Not only that, but it  has a great attitude with the monster not being shot to smithereens but  sent to recover in a reserve somewhere!  and to end with Bob Marley's Is  this Love, well that's just the icing on a thoroughly enjoyable cake.  Absolutely essential for the jaded horror movie fan and those who like  their horror with more then a little doseage of wit.  Sterling  stuff........forget Austin Powers and that creep Mini Me THIS is the  funniest film of the year by a mile!",947203200,2,889,4.50314465408805
1256945,3,B000035P86,"Okey Doke. I'd just like to start off saying that I liked pretty much every jaws rip off, but lake placid just doesn't click. last summer, i was pysched about two movies, lake placid and deep blue sea.  I saw deep blue  sea before lake placid and whammo. how awesome. Then I found that lake  placid was pretty lame. The acting was so-so, but the special effects were  WAY overdone. What sense is there building a huge croc for only 30 seconds  of screen time? I also thought the laughs were cheap and vague. I dunno, it  was pretty bad, but you can enjoy it if you don't take it too seriously",944870400,4,592,4.241071428571429
1256946,5,B000035P86,"Lake Placid was great, it is alot like Jaws only they got all of the facts right. I mean they never screwed up, crocodiles really can get that big, but the one thing that stumped me was how an Asianic crocodile could be found in Maine.  My favorite part of the movie is when the croc  takes out a GRIZZLY BEAR in like 5 seconds it was really cool.  Also  don't let the R of this movie scare you its really the language - not the  gore .  A great movie overall",942969600,9,459,3.9347826086956523
1256947,5,B000035P86,"I Saw This Movie In The Theater, It Was One Of The Best Movies, I`ve Ever Seen In My Entire Life. Very Scary....You Will Jump, The Plot Is Great, And The ""old woman"" Is Hilarious, I Wouldn`t Even Rent It First, Go  Ahead And Buy It, www.amazon.com Rulez.

1256948,5,B000035P86,"The whole movie, I just wished to see the Crocidile Hunter,from Animal Planet/Discovery Channel, pop up and defend the poor beast, but alas, Steve never came through. Apart from that, I really enjoyed it. I was expecting to see a B-movie, but it was enjoyable. A bit jumpy, but mostly funny.  Betty White was GREAT!!",941414400,2,316,4.745454545454545
1256949,3,B000035P86,What can you really say about a giant asian crocodile in a small lake in the New England area. This movie takes you out onto a small lake with a  large gator under it. The cast tries to learn how and why such a gator  would be in the small lake very far away from its home. The movie has its  funny moments along with its moments of action and adventure. This is a  great movie to buy especially if you're an animal lover!,941068800,,422,3.988095238095238

The premise of a monster lurking in a quiet town has been done may times before, and the city girl in the woods getting upset about staying in a tent is old, as well as unflattering to women.

Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, and Betty White are great in this movie. I love how the horror jumps out at you at unexpected moments. The comedy is blended in very well and doesn't make it like a comedy, but lightens the movies horror theme. Betty White is especially funny in her role.",1462838400,,599,4.454545454545454

1257604,5,B000035P86,"Lake Placid is a 1999 American monster horror comedy film. The film was written by David E. Kelley and directed by Steve Miner, starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, Betty White, Meredith Salenger and Mariska Hargitay. The plot revolves around a giant, 30-foot-long man-eating crocodile which terrorizes the fictional location of Black Lake, Maine, United States, and also follows the dysfunctional group who attempt to capture or destroy the creature.

Released within the same time frame of that other big monster movie Anaconda, Lake Placid emerged as a refreshing, humorous, large-budgeted experiment done right. Yes, there have been films about alligators and crocodiles before - but there's a good reason. These reptiles are creepy as hell! Here, as usual, the powers that be go way overboard, creating a monstrosity of a creature. In this case the crocodile is made to be huge, based on the myth of a giant breed that has supposedly been wiped out, similar to the Mastodon Peter Benchley used for Jaws. These overgrown lizards are pure CGI and at certain moments it's overly obvious but for the most part it works quite well.

 The main focus here isn't the ravenous predators, however, but the characters. You have the typical sheriff  whose IQ is considered equivalent to a steak. We have a snobby up tight New York female , as well as an eccentric researcher Hector Cyr . The game warden has everything - intelligence, sarcasm, and a certain sex appeal.  Dialogue is humorous, character interaction interesting, and everyone's sketched out well. Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, Oliver Platt, and Brendan Gleeson as the main characters act convincingly. Betty White is hysterical as the quirky, indignant lady who swears not like one but several sailors

There weren't many thrills but there was great tension at a few key parts. Suspense did exist in certain underwater scenarios. Jump scare tactics were used, particularly regarding Fonda and flying heads. Humor lightens the tone when bizarre events occur, but cuts in at the right time and doesn't spoil things.

In the end it's cheesy, sure. The special effects may be slightly inconsistent. But I loved every minute of it. Besides giggling at a few scenes I just had fun. It was enjoyable to sit back, turn my mind off, and watch the group (slightly akin to what the four stooges would be like) go at it in conquering this giant beast.

One thing I love about this movie is that it doesn't take itself seriously.  I enjoyed the dry humor mixed in with the chills  This is a great modern classic monster movie. Right up there with Jaws and the Beast, Anyway, Lake Placid has a great cast and is a good story, not just a formulaic monster movie. If I had to pick one movie that I believe jettisoned the current craze for schlocky creature features it is this movie.  It paved the way for todays fun B-movies in the vein of Sharknado and pretty much any film in the Asylum catalog.

Clocking in at an hour and twenty-two minutes, Lake Placid is a great example of the term less is more. It doesnt overstay its welcome and accomplishes what it wants to within its run time. I think its legacy of made-for-TV sequels speaks for its appeal to monster movie enthusiasts who enjoy a little humor and cheese with their severed limbs and decapitated heads.",1433116800,3,3339,4.848857644991213

1257728,4,B000035P86,"If I had to pick one movie that I believe jettisoned the current craze for schlocky creature features to where its at now, it would be 1999s Lake Placid. Full of ridiculous characters, gory killings, and a cameo from Betty White in which she swears not like one but several sailors, it paved the way for todays fun B-movies in the vein of Sharknado and pretty much any film in the Asylum catalog. Scream Factory once again reminds horror fans of another forgotten classic with its release of the Lake Placid Collector's Edition.

A group of investigators are called to a remote lake in Maine after the mysterious death of a police officer occurs in the usually calm waters. Upon arriving, the team discovers that a crocodile has somehow made its way into the lake and is feeding on anything big enough to satisfy its appetite... whether it be animal or human. Where did the beast come from and how can they stop it before it kills again?

Lake Placid boasts an ensemble cast of actors who looking back now would consider this slumming it by how they're viewed today. Bill Pullman portrays one of the crocodile hunters and puts forth every effort to take the material seriously. Bridget Fonda is a paleontologist who delivers an emotional performance completely unnecessary for such a lighthearted adventure romp. Brendan Gleeson plays the local sheriff and youd never know he would grow into such a respected British thespian of cinema. Oliver Platt fully embraces his role as an eccentric rich boy obsessed with the oversized scaly lizards.

The movie is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (2.35:1) with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround. Were given a clean picture that maintains a real film look and doesnt reveal the limitations of CGI work in the late 90s as it very well could have. The sound puts the viewer dead center in the thick of the action and outdoor environment.

Scream Factory has once again delivered the goods when it comes to bonus material for the Lake Placid Collector's Edition. Director Steve Miner, actor Bill Pullman, and Director of Photography Daryn Okuda, and the Special Effects team all provide new interviews for the release. A vintage featurette, TV spots, and a theatrical trailer are included as well.

Lake Placid is rated R for violent creature attacks and related gore, and for language. Theres no nudity but plenty of conversations about sex and innuendos. If you have a weak stomach when it comes to onscreen carnage, you might find yourself hurrying to close your eyes at points.

Clocking in at an hour and twenty-two minutes, Lake Placid is a great example of the term less is more. It doesnt overstay its welcome and accomplishes what it wants to within its run time. I think its legacy of made-for-TV sequels speaks for its appeal to monster movie enthusiasts who enjoy a little humor and cheese with their severed limbs and decapitated heads.",1407542400,,2899,4.8582995951417

1257750,5,B000035P86,"So there's something weird going on in Black Lake... something seems to be eating people. Sounds like your typical plot outline for a horror movie with zombies or werewolves but this sassy dark comedy is not about the living dead or people who go a little furry when the moon is full.
  It's about a crocodile.
  A really big crocodile.
  In addition to a really big reptile, ""Lake Placid"" has some really big acting talent to go along with a wry script and some smooth direction: Brendan Gleason, Oliver Platt, Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda and the incomparable Betty White help to make it a really fine flick for a Saturday night on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn. The plot isn't as deep as the lake but it's enough to hold the movie together and the fact that the story takes place in Maine gives it just the right amount of offbeat charm. The ending is clever and contains a nice surprise twist that makes the movie all the more satisfying.
  As an added bonus: Look for some nice cameos by Mariska Hargitay (before she became a household name on ""Law & Order: SVU) and Adam Arkin while you're watching the really nice movie.",1392076800,,1133,4.466019417475728

also enjoy this movie for its exaggerated danger as well as
the interesting scuffles among the human group. It has a satisfying
ending that gives us faith in the common man's ability to answer such

1257760,5,B000035P86,"Released within the same time frame of that other big monster movie Anaconda, Lake Placid emerged as a refreshing, humorous, large-budgeted experiment done right. Yes, there have been films about alligators and crocodiles before - Alligator, Alligator 2: The Mutation, Eaten Alive, Crocodile (few versions of those)....but there's a good reason. These reptiles are creepy as hell! Here, as usual, the powers that be go way overboard, creating a monstrosity of a creature. In this case the crocodile is made to be huge, based on the myth of a giant breed that has supposedly been wiped out, similar to the Mastodon Peter Benchley used for Jaws. These overgrown lizards are pure CGI and at certain moments it's overly obvious but for the most part it works quite well.

 The main focus here isn't the ravenous predators, however, but the characters. You have the typical sheriff (Sheriff Hank Keough) whose IQ is considered  equivalent to a steak. We have a snobby up tight New York female (Kelly Scott), as well as an eccentric researcher Hector Cyr . The game warden has everything - intelligence, sarcasm, and a certain sex appeal, or maybe it's just a case of my thinking Bill Pullman's hot, I don't know.

Dialogue is humorous, character interaction interesting, and everyone's sketched out well. Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, Oliver Platt, and Brendan Gleeson as the main characters  act convincingly. Betty White is hysterical as the quirky, indignant lady whose language would put a truck driver to shame.

 Directed by Steve Miner (Friday the 13th 2 and 3, House), we get plenty of crocodile point of view shots and some great underwater scenes. David E. Kelly's script may not have been realistic, but it was fun. How serious and sophisticated can you get with a plot of this measure anyway?? An Asian 30 footer in a small Maine lake = fun but senseless times. The score adds to the horror spree, especially when people are trying to get out of the water.

 There weren't many thrills but there was great tension at a few key parts. Suspense did exist in certain underwater scenarios. Jump scare tactics were used, particularly regarding Fonda and flying heads. Humor lightens the tone when bizarre events occur, but cuts in at the right time and doesnt' spoil things.

 In the end it's cheesy, sure. The special effects may be slightly inconsistent. But I loved every minute of it. Besides giggling at a few scenes I just had fun. It was enjoyable to sit back, turn my mind off, and watch the group (slightly akin to what the four stooges would be like) go at it in conquering this giant beast.",1379635200,,2602,4.824719101123596

1257784,3,B000035P86,"When watching ""Lake Placid,"" the 1999 Steve Miner/David Kelley comedic horror film, I was reminded of those bad B flicks I used to see as a kid at the neighborhood theater. They were usually promoted by a colorful movie poster with a shadowy menace looming over victims. The reasoning -- as Roger Corman well knows -- if the poster is good, the movie must be fantastic! So I slammed down my wrinkled dollar bill. There was a Bigfoot film from 1976,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creature-from-the-Black-Lake/dp/B000ERVKAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creature from the Black Lake</a>, and I was so excited I could barely get through the trailers. And then the film started, an amateur muddle with bad acting, wavering camera and canned music. I remembered that long-ago Saturday afternoon when viewing ""Lake Placid.""

A lot of money was poured into this production, with a good cast and beautiful locales. But it's a dud with a good movie poster. The film never plays it straight, with gimmicky situations winking at the camera. As most probably know, Betty White has a considerable supporting role as a lakeside hermit. It's not that White isn't funny -- she is -- it's just that she belongs in spoofs of films of this type. That's a question I have about ""Lake Placid."" Is this a spoof? If so, you had better make a film with more finesse than this one.

The location is a remote lake in Maine residing near one of those picturesque towns where you have a paperboy riding a Schwinn. People are disappearing and the local sheriff, game warden and alluring scientist decide to investigate. It's discovered a 30-foot crocodile has taken up residence, and soon our puzzled protagonists are joined by a famous, helicopter-flying hunter who wears hippie beads while jamming to Tom Jones. This eclectic crew is as efficient as Abbott and Costello.

Miner has trolled these waters before directing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-II/dp/B001DCZ4HI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th - Part II</a>&nbsp;(arguably the best of the endless series) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warlock/dp/B001H1WX6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warlock</a>. But the discredit must go to Kelley. A prolific television writer who churned out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ally-McBeal-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000TGURZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ally McBeal: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boston-Legal-Season-One/dp/B000EHSVBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boston Legal - Season One</a>, he has a tendency to navigate unusual whimsy, seemingly bored with normal plot flow. Sometimes it works. Who doesn't love a Barry White cameo at Ally's office party? But Kelley's films, including the uneven&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Alaska/dp/B00003CWUX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery, Alaska</a>, have all the subtly of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scary-Movie/dp/B00AYB16EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scary Movie</a>. There are moments of genuine skill, though one gets the feeling he's throwing too many elements at the wall to see what sticks.

Bill Pullman practically saves the film as the shy, but determined game warden. A likable talent with great skill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zero-Effect/dp/B000VIH2BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zero Effect</a>), he thankfully plays it straight. I would have liked for the story to have been told from his viewpoint. Bridget Fonda as the screwball scientist is in over her head. An acquired taste, her strained efforts substantially weaken the film. Brendan Gleeson is at his burly best as the sheriff with a big gun. Of course there's Oliver Platt doing his best Richard Dreyfuss impression as the guru hunter. Platt can chew the scenery with the largest of crocodiles, but his performance is too over the top to be taken seriously.

If you like CGI effects, the crocodile is fairly menacing. But the clumsy action scenes are difficult to follow. There are times when it's as big as Godzilla, and others when it's the size of a flat-bottom boat. If you're going to make a monster movie, the erratic scenes of confrontation need to at least be plausible. And finally there's Betty White, who enjoys feeding the creature like ducks on a pond. Who came up with that idea? Was Angela Lansbury unavailable?

Good acting and a wildly implausible story combine to make for a very funny movie with definite ""JAWS"" type moments.  It seems creatures other than sharks can be hiding in the water, even in Lake Placid.

The talent can't be hidden when you have actors such as Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, and Oliver Platt on the screen.  However, the kicker is Betty White.  As an older 'mother' fighting to keep her water bound 'babies' out of harms way, she is beyond wonderful.  What a mouth on that lady!

This was produced with no enhancement so you have to set your player to send the signal at 480p to get the correct aspect ratio. Other than that it's a great thrill ride.

The acting is fine but the real draw for me from day one was Betty White. She shows the bent sense of humor she is so repected for now. Remember this was 1999. And when I saw Kingdom of Heaven, I was surprised to learn that one of the nastiest charactors was played by Brendon Gleason, who I mistook for a down-Mainer.

This is a great representative of its genre and should be a film enjoyed for what it is, no more, no less.

I could zoom in to get it to fill most of the screen, but that reduced the resolution.  Worse, however, was the sound.  The background music and the special effects noises were extremely loud, while the witty dialogue was almost inaudible.

1257817,3,B000035P86,"A mindlessly fun distraction with some scary moments, Lake Placid (1999) is a well-executed, formulaic, big studio production, with impressive cinematography, stunts, and special effects.  The Stan Winston Studio, delivers a mean, nasty, and pretty cool looking croc.  Those elements, combined with a sense of humor and style, helps the film overcome a cookie cutter plot, and average acting.

A man is bitten in half by an unknown creature in Black Lake, Maine.  A tooth, found in the man's remains, brings paleontologist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) to the scene, where she manages to become attached to the investigation being conducted by Sheriff Keough (Brendon Gleeson), and Fish and Game officer Jack Wells (Bill Pullman).  The group is joined by millionaire Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt), who arrives in town on his private helicopter.  Cyr is a professor of mythology, an expert on crocodiles, and a somewhat reckless nutcase, who takes over the expedition, much to the distress of the Sheriff.

It isn't long before the team have their first encounter with a giant crocodile, as some get tossed into the lake.  The croc stays unseen for a long time, but makes a dramatic first appearance, grabbing a bear.  When they observe Delores Bickerman (Betty White), who owns a farm along the lake shore, feeding one of her cows to the giant croc, they conceive a mad plan of hanging a cow from the helicopter as bait.  This sets up the thrilling conclusion where the semi competent team barely manages to avoid a disaster, while trapping the beast in a most unusual manner.

The cartoonish Professor Cyr, helps to liven up the mostly sleepy group, who don't seem to have a clue.  His ridiculous behavior and childish banter with Sheriff Keough, provides the main comic relief.  Romance appears deliberately clumsy, but it predictably slips in at the finish, with sappy feelings being expressed between the low-key county boy Jack Wells, and the semi-capable but rather talkative city gal, Kelly Scott.

Written and produced by David E. Kelly (LA Law, The Practice, Ally McBeal) and directed by Steve Miner (House, Halloween H2O, Day Of The Dead), Lake Placid is an example of what can be done when a half decent idea, gets sufficient financial and technical backing.  The story and acting are solid but not great, however bolstered by nicely executed action sequences, and classy special effects from Stan Winston, the film is solidly entertaining, and had enough juice to achieve financial success, and spawn at least two sequels.  Unfortunately Lake Placid 2 (2007), and Lake Placid 3 (2010), pale in comparison to the original, and have frittered away what little credibility there was in the franchise.",1299888000,2,2703,5.054054054054054

However, I'm pleasantly surprised to say that part 1, the first of Lake Placid, is actually pretty decent! If you want to watch this, watch only the first part and mayyyybe the second part. The first part is a lot better than either of the other two. I enjoyed it and it did give me a smile on my face, especially Betty White who I find is a funny o' lady. The rest of the cast was pretty decent, all the characters come to grow on you and you begin to enjoy their company more and more throughout the movie.

I actually started watching the first movie pretty irritated due to accidentally watching parts of second and third because they were so horrible. I was busily jotting down complaints, but eventually the movie became more likable as it progressed. It's basically a sci-fi horror with humor added to it.

Another element to its credit is the sketch of a romantic comedy which sort of weaves through the film, not taking the spotlight but adding a note of gaiety. Bridget Fonda and Bill Pullman handle that part of it about as well as its throwaway role in the picture allows.  The other players do a good job with the stereotypes they are playing and the creators of the monster are to be congratulated for the credible threat and camera-suitable appearance  of their invention.

Bridget Fonda plays the Ally McBeal...no, stuff that, to all intents and purposes she is Ally McBeal. Bill Pullman plays the straight man Park Ranger. Brendan Gleason (aka Mad-Eye Moody from Harry Potter) plays the sarcastic and cynical sheriff. And Oliver Platt steals the show as Hector Cyr, a crazy Crocodile expert.

The film picks up for me 20 minutes in, when Oliver Platt makes his first appearance. He instinctively realizes exactly what this film is aiming for, and understands his role perfectly. The best moments in the film is his hilarious by-play with Brendan Gleeson. ""Is this the man who was killed?"". ""He seemed taller."". It's the sole reason to see this film, if I'm honest with myself.

So yeah - don't go into this film expecting a monster-gore fest. It's an odd-mix of comedy and monster-action that doesn't always work. The best reason to see this film is Oliver Platt.",1231286400,2,1145,4.861538461538461

Lake Placid is total Wild the horror subgenre of giant animals running amok, Lake Placid features a giant crocodile that has somehow found its way to an isolated lake in Maine. The absurdity of crocodiles in Maine sets the tone for the entire movie, which has no ambitions beyond mixing a little fright with a little humor. Bridget Fonda (Point of No Return, Jackie Brown) plays a paleontologist sent to investigate a large tooth; Bill Pullman (Independence Day, Lost Highway) is a fish and game warden just trying to keep the peace; Oliver Platt (Funny Bones, Flatliners) plays a loose-cannon mythology professor who swims with crocodiles for sport; and Brendan Gleeson (an excellent but little-known actor, most noted for The General) is a local sheriff with a short temper and a big gun. Add a few gruesome dismemberments, Betty White as a cantankerous old broad who may have murdered her husband, and a cow hanging from a helicopter, and there you have it: Lake Placid.

1257858,4,B000035P86,"This movie is very good. Maybe I liked this movie because the acting was not bad for this kind of films, and for the very good croc in both its CG and animatronic versions. I notice that this movie is compared many times with the movie Anaconda. I honestly do not see many similarities between those movies and the reason why they are compared so much. Both movies were good but I personally liked more Lake Placid than Anaconda. The movie has its flaws but I'm not going to list the bad things. Good for the price of $9.99 and I personally also liked the direct-to-video sequel which might be in big disagreement with most people who have rated the product but its not worth the price of $19.99.

1257859,4,B000035P86,"When ""Lake Placid"" was first released, I just assumed that it was yet another ""Jaws"" rip-off and consequently avoided it. It was only later, when I discovered that it was written by David E. Kelley (creator of ""The Practice"", ""Ally McBeal"" and ""Boston Legal""), that I decided to give it a try. Although it is true that, in principle, ""Lake Placid"" is a ""Jaws"" rip-off (substituting a 30 foot crocodile for a shark), to describe it that way is extremely misleading. In fact, ""Lake Placid"" is a sarcastic comedy that's purpose seems to be to point out just how weird the residents of Maine really are (just in case Stephen King novels haven't already convinced you of this), rather than to provide any actual scares.

Top billing in this film is given to Bill Pullman (as a Fishing and Game representative) and Bridget Fonda (as a palaeontologist), but really this film belongs to Oliver Platt (as an eccentric university professor who believes that crocodiles are god-like and who likes to swim with them). Pullman just spends the film looking sarcastic or bemused and every time Fonda appears, she falls into the lake, but Platt gets all the good lines and really carries the film. In fact, I think he has more screen time and lines of dialogue than the two supposed stars. Mention should also be made of Betty White (that sweet old lady from ""The Golden Girls"") who appears in a supporting role as a ""sweet little old lady"" who isn't as sweet as she first appears. If you have seen Betty White in ""Boston Legal"", and liked her character there, you will really love her in ""Lake Placid"". She steals the show every time she appears. And finally, the crocodile. Yes, there are one or two gory moments in this film (a diver gets bitten in half and a deputy gets his head bitten off), but these moments are few and far between. For the most part, my family just found the crocodile to be cute and found ourselves to be cheering him on.

1257861,3,B000035P86,"This is a movie that had a storyline with all the potential in the world, quickly turned into mediocrity.

It's about a 30-something foot long super crocodile that's super deadly and lives in a lake.  Of course, it's a threat to the people who live around the area (or rather, the few people who actually live there).

While the potential for a horror thriller was certainly there, the acting skills were bad from the characters.  Instead of feeling concern or fear for their well-beings, and for the safety of those around them, instead everyone acts like a bunch of sarcastic comedians.  In fact, the one police officer even mentions the unbelievable amount of sarcasm from the people around him.  That pretty much sucks out any kind of suspense we might get from the super crocodile.

1257875,5,B000035P86,"""Lake Placid"" is one of those so-bad-it's-good movies. A ridiculous situation played completely straight with the aid of a slyly funny script and direction makes this a very amusing B-movie for the new millennia.

The cast is excellent in their roles: Bridget Fonda is a self-centered New York paleontologist sent to Maine to hunt for crocodiles due to a love affair gone horrible awry. She whines and annoys all other cast members, except for the hunky guy in charge of the crocodilian operation (Bill Pullman) who grudgingly falls for her. Oliver Platt was the cast member that was the champion of annoyance (especially to the Sheriff), but he does have some wonderfully ludicrous lines about the mythology of crocodiles, and best of all he allows his helicopter to be attacked by a thirty foot crocodile. (This may be the only crocodile versus helicopter fight scene ever filmed.) The Sheriff, played by wonderful character actor Brendan Gleeson is supposedly the dimwitted redneck, but actually manages to have more insight into the situations presented to him that the rest of the cast combined, subtly turning the B-movie adage about local law enforcement being dumb lunks completely around. I thought his acting was the best in the film and especially enjoyed his repeatedly being trapped in snares set by Platt. The best reaction shot in the film occurs when Gleeson engages Platt about a human toe discovered in the woods. By far my favorite character in the film is the crazy, foulmouthed old woman, Mrs. Bickerson, who may have murdered her husband, played in a wonderful and whimsical quirk of casting by Betty White.

The film itself is relatively predictable, although I had never before seen a grizzly bear be devoured by a crocodile, nor had I ever seen a cow suspended into a lake from a helicopter. In other words, the script, though played straight, skewers all the old conventions of monster movies. The DVD also has trailers and a brief documentary about the movie, which I found enjoyable.

This film is not groundbreaking in any way. The reason I gave it five stars was because it captures all the conventions of creature feature movies in one 82 minute film, simultaneously subtly skewering them while also respecting the lore of genre.",1196812800,5,2260,4.95778364116095

It has some moderate horror moments but also contains a number of laugh out-loud moments, making it the best horror-comedy since ""An American Werewolf in London"" 18 years earlier. The story is pretty obvious from the DVD cover so I won't discuss that. Acting honours go to Betty White as Mrs Bickerman, but mostly to Brendan Gleeson who is marvellous as the local Sheriff.

Interestingly the director is Steve Minor a veteran director of many slasher horror films (Friday 13th Part II etc). He also worked on the notorious ""Last House on the Left"" in the early 1970's. It just goes to show how age can mellow you.

1257879,5,B000035P86,"I've just finished watching it and now I've restarted the DVD so I can write this review as I watch it.  The bottom line on this movie is basicly you take all of the mutant animal type movies, gators, sharks, and so on Lake Placid is probably the best put together, written, acted, and directed movie of them all.  It is not boring.

PROS:

1.  It has actors that can act.  That's a star.

2.  A director that can direct.  Thats a star.

3.  A writer who can write.  That's a star.

4.  The movie is a variation of several older ideas I have already named above but is carried out in an interesting way--the acting, and writing.  That's a star.  The idea is a croc finds it way to a back water lake, sets up housekeeping, and years later gets to be 30 feet long--that's a lot of croc!  The local sheriff -- poor guy- seems to be hated by the entire world.  He seems to have been born in a world full of sarcastic people that hate him.  He gets it from everybody in the movie all the way up to Betty White.  Everytime they find a head he gets slapped.  Everytime he ask a simple question someone unloads on him.  The croc, of course, has to live in his area.  The scientist arrive, they go after the croc, he goes with them, one of them slaps him (the heads), one calls him fatty, Betty White calls him Sherlock--after Sherlock Homes.  Yep...that sheriff is cannon folder for the universe.  I will say, he gave back as much as he got--real funny.

5.  There is some cussing, not a huge amount--certainly not like they usually do in these modern movies...just occasionally.

six.  There is a lot of dialogue in this movie and is a big part of the interesting and funny parts.  It is what seperates this movie from almost all monster movies.  A nice song from Tom Jones (It's Not Unusual) that adds to the atmosphere and part of one of the song from the Partridge Family (I Think I Love You)--I'm not sure but it didn't sound like them singing.

7.  Few sub plots here so most of the movie is about the monster hunt--what sub plots there are help with the movie.

That's that.

CONS:

1.  There isn't much in the way of CONS: for this type of popcorn movie.  It is plenty interesting, funny, and lots of sharp wit to who enjoy a sharp sarcastic retort in realitly.  I do.

So there it is.  I recommend this movie to the popcorn crowd and those of us who like that sharp wit in our movies--Casablanca had some.  Considering the movie has some fine writing and acting I recommend the full spread, popcorn, a couple of hot dogs, and something to wash it down with.  Bye!

1257880,5,B000035P86,"A giant crocidile wreaks havoc in an otherwise idyllic lake.  It sounds like it could, if done right, be a pretty good monster movie, but by utilizing the crocodile to far-better-than-expected effect, by loading twenty times as much genuine comedy as can be found in many box-office blockbusters marketed under the 'comedy' heading, by managing to keep all the humor from turning the movie into a stupid self-spoof, and by loading ""Lake Placid"" up with an uncommonly great array of characters, the fillmmakers have managed to hit on total excellence.

  The first attack comes during a routine survey of the title lake by a wildlife official, accompanied by the local sherriff (Brendan Gleeson, who manages to steal scene after scene against a host of better-known and very talented co-performers).  The initial tone set is light and comedic, and the sudden (and unexpectedly bloody) slaughter of the surveyor is a quick example of how the movie switches gears back and forth between moods like slice-of-life-tranquil (GORGEOUS lake/forest setting), laugh-out-loud funny, and high-speed gory action-horror on a dime.  A full team of police is dispatched to stake out the lake and investigate, another wildlife expert (Bill Pullman) is sent in; the recovery in the remains of the original victim of a tooth that matches prehistoric crocs closer than modern-day ones results in the arrival of a paleontologist (Bridget Fonda), whose prescence makes no sense at all to either herself or the other members of the group, but her boyfriend/musuem boss thought sending her off on a wild goose chase into the woods was a good way to get rid of her after she discovers his affair with another musuem worker (good grief, that sounds preposterous writing it, but in the tone of the movie's sometimes-comedy vibe, it actually felt appropriate).  To top off the gang, a maverick reptile expert/adventurer (Oliver Platt) shows up hoping to swim with the crocodile and commune with it.  An eclectic crew to say the least, although they seem kind of normal compared to the widow (Betty White) who lives on the lake and her offers her own unique opinions on the happenings.

  How does one describe this without making it sound generic?  For starters, ""Lake Placid"" is far more clever than one would think, more clever than, I think, they usually even try to go with action-comedies, which is how they seemed to be presenting this in its marketing, although the movie fits very well under the horror banner as well.  The characters are original, not just stock players that get trotted out quite frequently to fight sharks and the like, the dialogue is witty, credible, and flows naturally.  The action takes off like a rocket at times, there are some jolting scares, a surprising amount of sexiness (that female deputy added a lot; she was another of the major players) and little romantic dashes.  The ending is completely atypical for a 'killer beast' movie, very original, not telegraphed at all, and actually very refreshing.  The effects are high-caliber and the acting universally top-notch.

  ""Lake Placid"" is a total success on every level it applies itself, and that was more levels than I thought it would go for, more than it even had to.  Possibly more than wold have seemed wise - the contrasting styles could have ended up tripping over one another, but instead it was balanced extremely well.

The moments of suspense are satisfying and the CG crocodile is actually quite brilliant making this a likeable and quality film, without being outstanding or memorable. At a cheap price it is worth collecting, especially to those who enjoy these types of movies, along the lines of the hunter becomes the hunted. Running at less than 80 minutes, the movie never becomes boring and doesn't waste time exploring the backgrounds of the charcters involved, as often happens in movies of a similar genre, which lets face it, is totally irrelevant to the film.

The problem is that this is the kind of movie that in 20 years will be lampooned by a show like ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" which tells you that the movie is campy and often funny.

Our story opens at a lake in Maine, locally called Lake Placid, though that is not the name of the lake (that name was already taken, said one of the characters). We see a diver in the lake investigating a beaver lodge, with periodic fake clues that something might be in the water. Of course you know that we won't see the something until the director is ready, with the goal that you might jump at least a little. The diver of course ends up losing a lot of weight (about 40% would be my guess), and a lot of blood, which then ends his life. Our ""something"" in the water leaves behind a little clue (a tooth), and Bridget Fonda has to be called in to find the something (she's a paleontologist, you see).

Bridget Fonda is hilarious. She is all New York with the Maine locals, and the usual contrast between someone that hasn't the foggiest idea how to survive in the country with people who spend most of their time in it is great for laughs. Bridget also gets hit with a variety of animal parts (by accident), which is generally disgusting to anyone, but for an urbanite it must be truly awful.

Bill Pullman plays the local sheriff, whose concept of animal control involves really big guns (from Bridget's point of view, he's definitely a hick). Bill plays this role so naturally that you have to wonder whether he could end up being typecast. Bill does several things that aren't very smart, and eventually he and Bridget come to middle ground (really middle by the end of the movie).

Of course, the real star is the crocodile. I guess crocodiles weren't content to stay in New York City; they had to migrate further north. The movie explains this with hand waving about warm weather and the gulf stream and a convenient excuse to plot a crocodile into a Maine lake (it connects with the sea, you see). The crocodile makes a number of digital appearances, and several mechanical ones, and is often believable and just as often not. How the crocodile was dealt with near the end was reasonably original.

No one is going to confuse this movie with quality. It's apparent that wasn't the director's intent in any case. This movie is played for campy laughs, and as such, it does a pretty decent job. This movie is the kind of movie that you watch with your significant other, in the dark, and with a bowl of popcorn on the table. It's not so much that it's a great movie, but it's very entertaining and just too much fun. Silly me, I'll be watching it again.",1144195200,2,2743,4.434523809523809

Cast:  Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, Betty White, David Lewis, Tim Dixon, Meredith Salenger.

Running Time:  82 minutes

Rated R for violent creature attacks and related gore, and for language.

""Lake Placid"" starts in Maine, New England on Black Lake (it turns out the preferred named of Lake Placid was already taken) as Sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson) hangs around in a boat waiting as a beaver tagging diver goes about his job, yet suddenly Hank sees the diver in trouble and when the diver is finally pulled aboard he has been bitten in half. Cut to a New York museum where paleontologist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) is told to travel out to Black Lake and investigate the discovery of a tooth in the diver's wounds. Along with Hank and some of his Deputy's and a local Fish and Game warden Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) Kelly attends a camping expedition to discover the owner of the tooth and what killed the diver. Once there, an eccentric millionaire called Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt) who worships Crocodiles flies in and joins the expedition but fails to convince the team of the possible existence of a Crocodile in Black Lake. As severed moose heads and human toes turn up it quickly, becomes apparent that Hector is right and they are in fact dealing with a prehistoric 30-foot Crocodile that likes to eat unsuspecting people.

Writer David E. Kelley (screenwriter of hit television shows such as ""Chicago Hope"" and ""Ally McBeal"") has fashioned an unbelievably lazy script full of unanswered questions and illogic, choosing instead to pepper the dialogue constantly with sarcastic and witty remarks. Viewers' tolerance for his type of writing will dictate how much enjoyment is to be had with the film. Those expecting a straightforward and tense film will be let down by the almost light atmosphere as the characters bicker, debate and snipe at one another, while those who embrace his quirky, nearly surreal approach to things will doubtlessly find much to love here.  Pullman gives a fairly subtle, appealing performance and has little to do, really, except react to those around him. Fonda actually manages to incorporate a moderate amount of appeal into her grating character that has a penchant for falling out of vehicles and getting ""heads"" thrown at her. Gleeson gives the most affable and believable performance. The audience is invested in his well-being which is more than can be said for Platt. Sporting a ridiculous hairdo and a porcine physique, he's about the last person one would expect to see as a crocodile hunter. It's a real shame that lovely and bright Salenger (as a deputy) is forced to interact with and appear to be romantically interested in this ass. (Salenger, as a matter of fact, is even far more appealing than Fonda and could have played the leading female role quite well.) White steals the show in a tiny part laced with several ""shocking"" epithets, but her character makes no sense.  Director Steve Miner (famous, or infamous, for his ""Friday the 13th"" sequels) attempts to incorporate slapstick horror humor, yet the finished product here feels half-baked at best.",1136678400,,3170,4.975425330812855

However, it's been a few years since I've seen it, and I was bored one night so I gave it another chance.  I'm glad I did.  While it isn't as good as ""Anaconda,"" it does have some good qualities about it.  The cast does very well with the campy dialogue they are given.  The interactions between Oliver Platt and  Brendan Gleeson are downright funny, and their relationship really steals the show.  Everyone talks about Betty White's character in this flick, and it is pretty funny to watch her spew out curse word after curse word, but my favorite line of hers is how she delivers the word ""Sherlock!"" to Gleeson's character.

The crocodile looks pretty good.  In a couple of scenes it is obvious that he's an animatronic croc, but thank heavens that the entire thing isn't CG-created.  It's nice to see that puppeteers can still find work in Hollywood.  Though the puppets are great, the CGI isn't too shabby either.  The croc really is impressive to see on the screen.  He's definitely done on a higher level than the aforementioned ""Anaconda.""

I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys giant creature features with a hefty dose of macabre humor.  Though it may be subpar when compared to other films of the genre, it is definitely better than the SciFi channel offerings such as ""Dinocroc"" and ""Frankenfish.""

The summary is; Lake Placid is a movie with a certain style. It is ""beliavable"" to watch because of the camera, the (as mentioned) rather impressive effects, and the remembarable acting not least. I have forgotten some of these actors names (sorry!), but the ""rivalship"" between the sheriff and an eccentric crocodilehunter becomes witty -the way they behave like children and their arguments. Usually these B-movies (that I actually do not like to call this movie because of its' much higher level of creativity and talent) are missing exactly that. The humour, the ""relationship"" between the characters, well -they often conzentrate too much on the effects, and forget about the rest. On all movies, the acting and the story will always be the most important thing. It proves itself over and over again, and here finally for a B-movie -an exception.

Kelly treated moviegoers by taking time away from the torturous ""Ally McBeal"" and ""The Practice"" (as if lawyers aren't loathsome enough, we need shows about them!)to pen this bomb, which was intended to be a throwback to the campy giant monster/sci-fi movies of the '50s. Well, it falls right in line with the worst of them, that's certain.

""Lake Placid"" is badly acted, poorly written, suffers from every cliche in the book of monster movies, and above all else is a snoozefest. Bridget Fonda is a down-on-her-love-life lady scientist, who finds love with a wooden Bill Pullman in a duller-than-dirt peformance as a game warden. Brendan Gleeson gives a horrific turn as a sheriff who's about as sharp as a bowling ball, and Gleeson makes you wonder if he's mentally challenged as every word he utters appears to be a complete struggle. Oliver Platt is a scientist in love with gators who, by the end of his first line, is so annoying you want to reach through the screen and pull his nose hairs out. Betty White appears in a foulmouthed, utterly unbelievable role as the keeper of the beasts. Bad jobs all around.

The characters throughout the film do every stupid thing they possibly can to put themselves in danger or get themselves killed. Now, I know we'd all go diving in a lake inhabited by a 30-foot alligator, right? We'd also trudge out in a boat that's barely bigger than a bathtub, because Lord knows that'll be safe. It's okay though, because the main characters have a knack for escaping certain doom at any moment (unfortunately, the lowly deputies or divers lack this amazing skill, of course). The monster is well done, but not used nearly enough. It seems like the gator is there so that the characters can take a break from their boring dialogue and nearly get killed, going right back to said boring banter afterward. The monster should've been used in a much more menacing way, coming on land to make attacks, killing tourists, etc.

All the character cliches are there; loveless Fonda falls for Pullman, Platt and Gleeson rub each other the wrong way and battle the entire film, and they all somehow become sympathetic to a killer monster by film's end. White is the crazy old bag with the big secret of the lake, and apprently enough livestock to feed a monster that would decimate all life in the lake rather quickly. Not long into the film, you're hoping the gator kills them all. Tiny boats are attacked, and of course, a helicopter that lands on the lake is attacked as well (guess they forgot to spray it down with gator repellant). Kelly took what should've been a fun premise and turned it into a turkey along the lines of ""Anaconda"". It's not even a worthy watch for camp value. Somebody should hire Ally McBeal or The Pratice to sue Kelly for impersonating a filmmaker. At the very least, Ally could be used as a nice toothpick for the monster.",1110585600,4,2908,4.6647173489278755
1257935,5,B000035P86,"I thought the movie was cruel but funny. In this movie there lived a crocodile in lake placid. The first interesting thing to me was one guy's head was bitten off. They put a speaker in the water that was playing baby crocodile's crying. When the guy pulled up the speaker the crocodile came out of the water and bit the guy's head.

The second thing I liked was that everyone was fighting. They were arguing about killing the crocodile. Actually they weren't angry with each other. They were just telling their opinions. Hector was proud of his brown belt. But the sheriff punched Hector in the face because Hector said to the sheriff ""punch me"". Later the sheriff saved Hector.

Finally they caught the crocodile. They hung the cow from the helicopter to bring the crocodile out of the water. But the crocodile didn't come out. Later the crocodile came out of the water but the helicopter crashed into the water. Then the crocodile got stuck in the helicopter. Another crocodile came out of the water.

David E. Kelly wrote this, which is why it will feel to some like an extended episode of ALLY McBEAL gone camping. The animatronics are definitely on par, and the ""witty"" banter gets wearying for the same reasons that led to the insubstantial ALLY's cancellation. People always see through glibness eventually. So the moderately amusing dialogue passes the time, since they make the creature as absent as they can possibly get away with, but it's pretty lazy altogether. The music is really funny. They try and gin up this really sinister stuff when the helicopter does a fly-by of this blandly idyllic Maine town. It's very funny.
Bill Pullman is a genius, I've decided. His understated style carries this movie. Bridget Fonda over-hams the ""NY Girl Goes Camping"" routine, and keeps falling in the water.
Don't fall in the water! The creature lives in the water!
Platt and Gleeson have some sort of recurring personality conflict throughout most of the movie, the basis for slapstick yucks, which are really just some sort of surpressed homoerotic display behavior between two adult men. You'll see what I mean. Betty White plays the role of her lifetime...which means she has a couple of funny lines.

In spite of constant bickering between the cast members, someone this movie has an intriguing hold on me.  Bridget Fonda's tempermental character is oh so annoying. Her reason for venturing to Maine is quite ridiculous. The story does unfold with a few unpredictable seasons. I sure did not expect the crocodile to attack the bear so visciously.  The use of the cow as bait is quite hillarious.  Gosh that Betty White plays such a goofball.

1257957,4,B000035P86,"I'm a little embarrassed to say that I've seen this turkey three times from beginning to end.  The problem is that this is the kind of movie that in 20 years will be lampooned by a show like ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", which tells you that it's campy and often funny.
Our story opens at a lake in Maine, locally called Lake Placid, though that is not the name of the lake (that name was already taken, said one of the characters).  We see a diver in the lake investigating a beaver lodge, with periodic fake clues that something might be in the water.  Of course you know that we won't see the something until the director is ready, with the goal that you might jump at least a little.  The diver of course ends up losing a lot of weight (about 40% would be my guess), and a lot of blood, which then ends his life.  Of course, our ""something"" in the water leaves behind a little clue (a tooth), and Bridget Fonda has to be called in to find the something (she's a paleontologist, you see).
Bridget Fonda is hilarious.  She is all New York with the Maine locals, and the usual contrast between someone that hasn't the foggiest idea how to survive in the country with people who spend most of their time in it is great for laughs.  Bridget also gets hit with a variety of animal parts (by accident), which is generally disgusting to anyone, but for an urbanite it must be truly awful.
Bill Pullman plays the local sheriff, whose concept of animal control involves really big guns (from Bridget's point of view, he's definitely a hick).  Bill plays this role so naturally that you have to wonder whether he could end up being typecast.  Bill does several things that aren't very smart, and eventually he and Bridget come to middle ground (really middle by the end of the movie).
Of course, the real star is the crocodile.  I guess crocodiles weren't content to stay in New York City; they had to migrate further north.  The movie explains this with hand waving about warm weather and the gulf stream and a convenient excuse to plot a crocodile into a Maine lake (it connects with the sea, you see).  The crocodile makes a number of digital appearances, and several mechanical ones, and is often believable and just as often not.  How the crocodile was dealt with near the end was reasonably original.
No one is going to confuse this movie with quality.  It's apparent that wasn't the director's intent in any case.  This movie is played for campy laughs, and as such, it does a pretty decent job.  This movie is the kind of movie that you watch with your significant other, in the dark, and with a bowl of popcorn on the table.  It's not so much that it's a great movie, but it's very entertaining and just too much fun.  Silly me, I'll be watching it again.",1049673600,,2759,4.440476190476191
1257958,4,B000035P86,"OK, I know I like this more than I should, and I know on one level that it isn't really a 4-star movie.  But everytime I see this movie I get a real blast out of it, and if I encounter it while channel surfing, I always stay for a while to catch my favorite bits.
So why do I like this?  I think partly for the sheer absurdity of it.  Could anything sillier than an utterly gigantic crocodile living in a lake in Maine be concocted?  Well, yeah, you could, but it is absurd, and the makers of the film treat it as so.  The emphasis in the film is primarily on the characters and the humor, and far less on the monster.  That isn't to say that there aren't some great moments featuring the beast.  But the moments aren't always scary ones.  When our croc lunges onto shore to grab a bovine snack, one is more apt to laugh than scream.
What really makes the film work is the humor and the cast.  Brigit Fonda is a bit too whiny in her role, but she provides some balance to all the guys.  Bill Pullman is likable here as he always is.  Oliver Platt is one of my favorite actors, and I never fail to love him in just about anything he is in.  He adds spice here as a flamboyant crocodile hunter who comes and tries to steal the whole hunt for the predator crocodile.  Australian character actor Bredan Gleeson is one of the most chameleonic actors in the world.  He has portrayed a variety of bad guys in films, was ""Monk"" McGinn in THE GANGS OF NEW YORK, played a Latin revolutionary in THE TAILOR OF PANAMA, and has played a variety of Irishmen in several films.  In this one, he plays the local Maine sheriff.  I really enjoy the interaction between all the characters.

Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, and especially Betty White pretty much steal the show from the show's relatively wooden leads (Fonda and the much more tolerable Bill Pullman).

Allocated her first real field assignment, a palaeontologist from New York City, Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) finds herself amidst a party of curious onlookers in Maine to investigate the origins of a tooth extracted from a recent victim involved in a vicious attack along a lake. She is introduced to a local Fish and Game warden Jack Wells (Bill Pullman), an irritable sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson), and Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt), an ""eccentric millionaire mythology professor"", a crocodile fanatic who deifies crocodiles and contemplates he is ""untouchable"" and ""godly"".
Ticks, mosquitos and petty irritants of nature are essentially Kelly's assumed only fears. On the contrary, what the lake splashes up is a reflection of how trivial Kelly's anxieties really are. Overcoming their disparity, the warden, sheriff, palaeontologist, professor and deputies must explore all options and settle on a scheme that entails the enticement of the croc out of its territory, accompanied by unforeseen disasters.
'Lake Placid' is a highly acclaimed film directed by Steve Miner and produced by David E. Kelley and Michael Pressman. A 1999 20th Century Fox release, it is ""this year's 'Anaconda', only you spend as much time laughing as you do screaming"" (David Poland, TNT Roughcut.com).

A tossup between a frivolous comedy and an edgy horror film with an unpredictable end, 'Lake Placid' is befitting for any audience who holds a zest for the darker side of Nature.
Also featuring Meredith Salenger as Deputy Gare and Betty White as the widowed Mrs. Bickerman, it throws stones of wit, humour and horror with an inexorably smart and edgy dialogue, stretching the boundaries of extraordinary special effects to send out ripples of shock, telling a tale of the concealed secrets lurking beneath the Maine lake's serene surface.

1257991,3,B000035P86,"Beautiful Lake Placid's newest resident is causing quite a stir. It's thirty feet long, sports scores of razor sharp teeth, and eats whatever it pleases. It's presence becomes known when it adds the local residents to the menu. This once tranquil lake in Maine is now home to a crocodile. You may be thinking that this is highly unlikely. Yet, despite this utterly absurd premise - or, perhaps, because of it - Lake Placid is a lot of fun. It works as a horror movie, and it works as a comedy.
One enjoyable thing about the movie is that it doesn't give us a lot of pseudoscientific hogwash as to why there is a crocodile living happily in Maine. The film's characters have no idea why it is there. They only know it would be best if it left. I also liked that this creature doesn't spend its time stalking the cast. It's dangerous because it's awfully big and it eats accordingly. But it doesn't bear mankind a grudge, and it isn't some symbol of evil. What is frightening about it is not what it is, but where it is. In America, we have annihilated or contained almost every dangerous animal. Big predators are creatures we enjoy watching stomping around on The Discovery Channel. For most of us, they might as well live on another planet. So, what if you walked into your back yard and encountered something large, fast and hungry? Would you stand a chance?
The cast is great and looks as though they had a wonderful time making this movie. Bridget Fonda plays Kelly Scott, a paleontologist who is sent from a big city museum. In truth, her boss needed for her to get out of town. Kelly isn't pleased to be stuck in a backwoods New England town, and she quickly alienates Sheriff Hawk [Brendan Gleeson]. Soon, Jack Wells [Bill Paxton] arrives from the Game and Fish commission, and the trio sets out to investigate the lake. They are soon joined by Hector Cyr [Oliver Platt], an eccentric crocodile expert, who proves to be one of the film's funniest character. Along the way, they encounter the lakeshore's only human resident. She's Mrs. Bickerman [Betty White], and she's mad as a hatter. She thinks the group should just leave things the way they are.
Lake Placid is played for laughs, but it can also make you jump. It can be intense. In one scene, Hector Cyr is in the water. He turns around, and the creature is not more than five feet away. They are literally face to face. In another, Kelly is thrown out of a boat into the water. Here, the problem is that neither she nor we can see the beast. After each such scene, we get another round of laughs. The humor and the terror play off each other nicely.
This is not great moviemaking, but it is great escapist entertainment for those who enjoy this kind of thing. So many bad horror movies have been made that I think most people go into them expecting to be disappointed. For once, I wasn't.",1016582400,3,2853,4.4884615384615385
1257992,1,B000035P86,"Oddly, ""Lake Placid"" was written by the same screenwriter of the bad ""Ally McBeal"" and the stuffy ""The Practice,"" David E. Kelley. But this time, he's gone way over the top in writing a blantantly stupid horror/comedy that becomes increasingly stupid and gory along the way.
As you know, this about a giant crocodile living in a Maine lake, chomping on anything (and anyone) that unfortunately lands or goes swimming in the fittingly named ""Lake Placid."" A game warden, a palentologist and others go to this lake to stop the croc for good.
""Lake Placid"" is screamingly stupid, with no real scares or even some comedy, as this atrocious script by David E. Kelley proves. It's horrifyingly bad to not be campy fun. As in typical monster movies, a lot of gore and little scares go into this anemic script, while John Landis's superb monster movie, ""An American Werewolf In London"" outlives it by 200%.
It's enough to make ""Ally McBeal"" and ""The Practice"" seem good by comparison, and this goes along with the 1997 ""An American Werewolf In Paris"" as one of the gross-out horror farces of the '90s. Avoid it.",1016150400,3,1103,4.75

David Kelley's incredible black humor buoys the whocares plot; the alligator or is upstaged by the actors, for once.  From the initial explanation for the name of the lake (which is NOT Lake Placid) is hilarious.  I guess Kelley felt a movie named ""Black Lake"" wouldn't draw as much attention.  Anyway, he assembled a great cast, and gives them such unusual and fun dialogue.  Bridget Fonda is great as the paleontoligist who is sent off to Maine to examine a tooth; the true New Yorker, she can't tolerate mosquitoes, ticks, or snakes.  Oliver Platt goes over the edge in his role as the millionaire crocodile hunter, and has as much fun as I did.  Bill Pullman for once gets to play the straight man and if he looks bored, who cares?  Especially with the wonderful addition of Irishman Brendan Gleeson as the sheriff.  He has some great bantering with both Platt and Fonda.  Betty White proves to be a golden girl still as she chews up the scenery in her brief, but memorable, screen time.  The profanities coming out of this long-cherished ""sweetie"" are so unique, they're not the least bit offensive.

I don't know about you but that seems a bit low.  The brave and wierd people who come to study this big croc are your typical group of misfits, a game and fish warden, the whining main female researcher, the insane repile scientest, and the fat sherrif who wants to shoot his really big gun throughout the entire film.  The action is pretty dull in this movie, you get to see a croc eaten, the swearing grandma feed the croc, see croc try to eat helecopter (A tribute to Jaws II no doubt).  The only thrilling moment is when one of the main charachters comes face to face with the big croc in the lake and has to escape (Quite thrilling!)  The croc effects are fairly good, although they are not as good as the movie ""Alligator"".  Overall, this movie made me dissapointed.  It has some funny moments but that cant save it.

The hell?), and it's up to a paleantologist, a game warden, a millionare, and a doughy middle-aged sheriff to capture it.  Along the way, they'll meet a crazy old lady who swears like George Cartlin who tries to keep the croc out of their hands.  The millionare will throw a dance party on the shores of the lake.  They'll hang a cow from a helicopter to tempt the beast to come ashore.  And lastly, the big green reptile will become stuck in a helicopter cockpit while it's mate (there were two all along) gets blown apart by a bazooka.  At no point do we figure out how the animals got there, nor why they hadn't been sighted before the attacks began.  (Say it with me now: the hell?)  This movie is beyond garbage.  It's beyond forgiveness, as well.  The plot is contrived and flawed to the point of necessary euthing, the acting is worse than the human body can tolerate, and absolutely none of it is suspenseful or terrifying in any way.  So I leave you with a little request: if someone holds a gun to your head and orders you to watch ""Lake Placid"", let him shoot you.

Score: 57/100
After the gigantic success of Deep Blue Sea, Lake Placid was a big must-see for all monster movie fans. However, most critics and audiences left the cinema feeling a little disappointed. I was one of them, unfortunately.
When a man swimming in Black Lake is eaten alive by an unknown creature, the local Game Warden (Bill Pullman) teams up with a palaeontologist (Bridget Fonda) from New York to find the beast. Add to the mix an eccentric philanthropist with a penchant for ""Crocs"" (Oliver Platt), and here we go! This quiet, remote lake is suddenly the focus of an intense search for a crocodile with a taste for live animals...and people!
It's not as horrific or spooky as it sounds. Lake Placid is mainly a comedy, which is, surprisingly, a good thing. Mostly, it is able to put in good, hearty jokes and nicely laid out comedic set-ups, but Lake Placid is so short of spooks and chills that it becomes unintentionally hilarious, this and the fact that there is more time spent on land than in the water ruin the movie's potential to be a cult classic. Bridget Fonda and Oliver Platt have a jolly old time, and the camera-man has a lot of fun with the hardly-seen crocs, but overall, this is too flawed but be anything over a small mediocre film.

1258015,2,B000035P86,"David E. Kelley took a break from producing ""Ally McBeal,"" a show about an emaciated lawyer who never eats, to write this horror-comedy about a giant crocodile who tries to eat everything.  Bill Pullman (fitting, since scientists have since revealed Pullman himself to be a cold-blooded water-dwelling reptile) stars as the boring guy who wants to stop the crocodile, and Bridget Fonda plays the crocodile's love interest, a down-on-her-luck waitress given a share in a winning lottery ticket by nice-guy cop Nicholas Cage in a completely different movie.

And because David E. Kelley never wrote a line he didn't think was pure genius, instead of suspense and interesting things like... I dunno... people getting eaten by giant crocodiles, ""Lake Placid"" consists mostly of scenes of people spouting off rancidly bad, supposedly clever dialogue, then accidentally falling into the water from the safety of boats.  Fonda falls in no less than 1000 times.  Pullman's sonambulant ""charisma"" (he's the poor man's Bill Paxton, and I defy you to tell them apart) will make you wish you'd fallen in instead.  A crocodile expert (Oliver Platt) joins the hunt, and begins a strangely homoerotic love/hate relationship with the sheriff (Brendon Gleeson).

Eventually, director Steve Miner exhumes the dessicated corpse of one of the Golden Girls and has her curse nonstop for 20 minutes to fill out the film's paltry 82 minute running time.  Which will still seem about 80 minutes too long.  Actually, if it weren't for scenes featuring geriatric cursing or clumsy people flinging themselves from speeding boats, the rest of the movie could possibly occur in the amount of time it takes a hummingbird to flap its wings once.

Which, strangely enough, is about the amount of time this film features interesting events.

Still, this is arguably Kelley's best screenplay about a giant  crocodile since his attempt at the kiddie cartoon ""Alligator McBeal,"" about a reptilian lawyer who eschews food in favor of same-sex kisses from Lucy Lion, another lawyer with a dominatrix streak.  That is, until Steve ""Crocodile Hunter"" Irwin captures McBeal and forces her to eat his baby.  Weird guy, that David E. Kelley!

1258021,2,B000035P86,"`Lake Placid,' a pallid, pseudo-comic cross between `Jaws,' `Jurassic Park' and the legend of the Loch Ness Monster, at the very least, has the advantage of not taking itself too seriously. Otherwise, this silly tale of a giant crocodile inexplicably hidden under the depths of a Maine lake (named, for no apparent reason, Black Lake, not Placid) registers poorly on both the fright and the laugh meters.
After a man is half-devoured by an unseen creature of the deep, a team of investigators heads out to solve the mystery and eradicate the problem. Knowing that such a plot premise would undoubtedly elicit more howls of laughter than howls of fear, the filmmakers obviously decided to beat the scoffers to the punch line and chose, therefore, to frame the film within the context of a comedy rather than a straight horror film. I doubt `Lake Placid' would have been a very effective film in either tonal mode, but the endless stream of sarcastic quips, `clever' asides and witless one-liners emanating from the mouths of the characters does become a bit wearying after about the first admittedly amusing ten or fifteen minutes of the film.
In a similar vein, the characters (played by Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt among others) come across as clever and likable in their early scenes but soon grow irritating in their repetitious flippancy and whininess. Betty White, as a foul-mouthed local resident, likewise falls victim to this pattern. The one-note script soon becomes grating and, with the humor rendered ineffective, all we are left with is a highly incredible, not very terrifying tale. There's not much to say about `Lake Placid' except to verify conclusively that a horror/comedy without either horror or comedy has pretty much doomed itself to the video recycle bin for all eternity.",971568000,,1810,5.036666666666667

I enjoy Betty White's acting and she is extremely funny (not in this movie) but I did not find her foul language amusing.

The movie is not scary and we are left with only a few false  scares to cling to.  Even when the alligator shows itself, are we  experiencing a greater heart rate of that of a person sleeping peacefully.  This movie is just sooooo boring.

1258039,3,B000035P86,"Oooh, oooh-oooh, sometimes - the truth is harder than the pain inside. Thus sang Andy Bell of Erasure, as their first substantial hit, 'Sometimes', climbed to number 4 in the charts, justifying Vince Clarke's  decision to abandon hit-making Yazoo, who in turn had justified his  decision to abandon the fledgling Depeche Mode after their first album,  'Speak and Spell', the cover of which had a swan wrapped in some  curtains.
Erasure's music sings to us through the ages, a timeless  reminder of a time without time, a period in society which stood outside  fashion - the late eighties. Who now can look back and say that they were  not the best of times? The cultural fallout remains with us even today, as  the forces which shaped the pop world still shift their pop tentacles.  Barely a day goes by without a new chart act paying homage to such  luminaries as China Crisis, The Fine Young Cannibals and, of course, The  Woman from the Go-Gos who Wasn't Belinda Carlisle, You Know, She Did 'Rush  Hour', Jane Something. Transvision Vamp ruled the airwaves, and Sigue Sigue  Sputnik ruled the dancefloor.
And yet, it could have all gone badly  wrong. The early-nineties wave of one-hit 'rave' bands almost derailed  Erasure's quest for pure pop, and for a time, unimaginable now, it seemed  as if the future belonged to the Prodigy, Altern-8 and Messiah. Those days  are gone, thank goodness, but the horror remains fresh in our minds. We  will never forget those dark times, when obnoxious, masked figures stalked  the studios of Top of the Pops, samplers in hand, waving lit neon tubes and  shouting that they were going to take us higher and higher they were going  to take us higher and higher they were going to take us higher and higher  (ooo-eeeeeeeeeeeee, acieeeeddddd). Dang, dang dang - boosh! Blip blip blip  blippety blip blip - boosh! Ah yeah! Hey kids - this is a journey into  stereophonic sound MUST RESIST, MUST RESIST, must... resist....
As I have  just demonstrated, it was a seductive brew, one into which less stirling  souls could have fallen. But not me. I had seen the future. 'You stand on  one side', sang Erasure, 'and I stand on the other - are we divided?' Yes.  We are. The battle-lines had been drawn. War was upon us. One the one side  - pure pop, with tonal, three-minute symphonies of deep meaning, and on the  other, atonal ephemera.

1258043,2,B000035P86,"`Lake Placid' had some good points, some bad, but mostly it wasterrible.  This is like David E. Kelly on a bad trip.  Kelley, whohas written so many award winning TV hits (including `The Practice' and `Ali McBeal') must have wigged out and during the convulsion coughed up this mess of a script.  His penchant for throwing together odd characters engaging in puerile sardonic dialogue is taken to its bizarre extreme in this film.
With a `creature-feature' the plot is always the same: It's out there destroying things and killing people and our heroes need to get rid of it.  In this case the creature is a 30 foot crocodile from Asia that ends up in a lake in Maine.  There is never any explanation or even conjecture of how it got there or how it got so big.  It's just there; eating cows, bears, humans, and any other mammal that crosses its path.  The purpose of the creature in all such films is to scare us and then be neutralized at the hands of our heroes.  In this limited way the movie was a great success.  Unfortunately, even a creature-feature requires some dialogue.  This is where Lake Placid hits the water with a resounding thud.
Kelley attempts to create a black comedy, but unfortunately he leaves out the humor and replaces it with asinine banter.  The dialogue among this random hodgepodge of wackos is goofy, jejune, sarcastic and only occasionally funny.  Indeed the only really funny lines went to Betty White, who was a scream.
The direction by Steve Miner was first rate.  Miner is a veteran of the horror genre and all the action, suspense and beast sequences were expertly done.  The animatronics were fabulous as were the digital sequences when the crocodile was on land.  The locations were beautiful and nicely chosen for their backdrops.  Miner did as good a job as anyone could hope considering the actors had to run their lines between creature scenes.
There isn't much point to evaluating the actors (it was a good cast), because their characters were so weird, and they had so little material to work with, they all came across looking inane.
I'd give this film an 8 for the creature and about a 2 for the script.  Overall I rated it a 4/10.  Except for the croc, it's worth missing.",957484800,,2220,4.634271099744246

Then an insane crocodile expert, mythology  professor Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt) arrives, in hopes of finding what he  thinks is responsible for the man's death: an Asian Pacific Crocodile.  They soon discover a thirty-foot prehistoric croc in the lake (it bites off  a deputy's head), being fed by a crazy elderly woman (Betty White) on the  beach.  Although the local game warden, Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) and the  community sherriff want the beast destroyed, Cyr has other plans...

1258060,4,B000035P86,"That is how star Bill Pullman describes this movie, but I will tell you it is SO FUNNY! This is a real good time party movie: great humour, a few scares all with an ecological bent. The dialogue is crisp and brings all  the characters to life. The action is cool and believeable but never takes  over.
This is the story of a 30 foot croc that attracts the attention of  the law, a fish guy, a museum girl and a very rich eccentric after it rips  a beaver tagger in half. Now this disparate bunch can give lessons in  sarcasm and as you would expect they just do not get on.
But how does a  croc get to Maine? Well that is one question you have to figure out for  yourself (although there is a clue at the end). The film borrows (ever so  slightly) from Jaws and has some fantastic scenes (when the croc grabs the  bear for example).
Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt and Brendan  Gleeson play their parts straight to hilarious effect. Stan Winston's  effects are so much better than many monster movies but the prize has to go  to Betty White's Mrs Bickerman. She really steals the show.

1258114,4,B000035P86,"Written by David E. Kelley, the mastermind behind television's Ally McBeal and The Practice (both of which won Emmys in the ""best of"" categories last year), _Lake Placid_ is a comic horror film about the search for a giant  crocodile, inexplicably living in a landlocked lake in upstate New York.
  When a diver is eaten alive in the opening moments, by some unknown  creature, the local game warden (Pullman) teams up with a paleontologist  (Fonda) from New York to find the beast.  Add to this mix an eccentric  millionaire philanthropist with a penchant for swimming with  ""crocs"" (Platt), and the local sheriff (Brendan Gleeson), who  thinks the man is nuts, and you've got the recipe for one of the more  underrated of last summer's films.
 This is a horror film and it can, at  times, get quite messy (see the opening attack sequence, for example).  The  special effects work is about what you'd expect in such a film, although  with the advent of computer graphics, it's a lot easier to bring a  realistic giant crocodile to life.  Surprisingly, though, there are few  deaths in the film.
The emphasis is more on suspenseful moments of the  Jaws variety, in which we wonder whether unlucky swimmers are about to  become lunch.  And, there are even a couple of gross, but funny moments in  the film, as when an eccentric old lady (played by Betty White) offers  random farm animals as sacrifices to the croc.
But the real emphasis  in the film is on the humor and there are some great conversations and  arguments among the film's characters, particularly Platt's whacko  croc-swimmer and Brendan Gleeson's sheriff (in one of the more unusual bits  of casting, as the Irish Gleeson is forced to adopt an American accent,  which tends to slip in some of the more heated moments).  And White's  character is also played for laughs (you'll be surprised at some of the  inventive curses she comes up with).
 The film wasn't particularly  well-received when first released last summer, but luckily, with its  release on video, this can be remedied.  This is not a film for everyone's  tastes, but if, like me, you occasionally hunger for a  ""giant-animal-runs-amuck"" film, _Lake Placid_ more than fills the bill.",950745600,41,2213,4.852150537634409

David E. Kelly wrote some wonderfully bad dialogue for this  film. (Further fueling the controversey of whether he's the luckiest hack  alive or if he's really so talented he can turn out poetic garbage.)  Some  of the best lines are reserved for Betty White in a role like none you've  ever seen her portray.  One of her lines is so vulgar and preposterous that  you will find yourself giggling over it days later.
Brigitte Fonda is her  usual melodramatic self, but she's just so darn cute most people don't  care.  Oh, and then there's the Asian crocodile.  (An homage to the red  scare movies of the 50's? The Chinese are invading Maine perhaps?)  While  not even close to the CGI of a couple of Spielberg films it's at least not  disturbingly ludicrous like Anaconda.
This film has a lot in common with  Anaconda except that Anaconda tried to play it straight while Lake Placid  gleefully wallows in its silliness.

Bridget Fonda hangs around to look for a big croc after seeing someone get their head bitten off - why? - because she doesn't want to go back to a failed relationship (surely she  should try a dating agency instead). This film is really weird. I liked  most of the comedy elements (ie everyone insulting each other) but it  seemed that the croc was only incidental. Where is the body count? Why does  Bill Pulman always sleep-walk his way through his roles? Where were the  rest of the Golden Girls? The croc itself looked pretty cool in some parts  (especially the bear scene) but rubbery in the close ups. Unlike the film  Alligator (which I think is far better) there is no tension & you end  up wanting the cast to leap Lemming-like into the lake.

The movie's only three minutes  in and we've all ready got one of the most gruesome looking killings in a  horror movie.

One other guy got his head bitten off but. .  .HELLO!  Where's the gore?  The scares?  The attacks?  Besides that, we  don't even hate the crocodile like we hated Jaws the shark.  We feel  sympathy for the poor creature and don't give a flip about the goofball  dorks hunting him down.  The movie finally ends at a paltry 80 minutes.  Not only does it not have hardly ANY attacks, it's the shortest movie I  think I've seen.  Well, I think that honor might go to ""Halloween:  H20"" (Which coincidentally is ALSO directed by this film's guy, Steve  Miner).  Kudos to the special effects team, though.  I've NEVER been more  convinced that a creature was alive.  The croc really looked real.

I thought the characters in this movie were great,  but I didn't realize it until the film was almost over.  The script writer  should have taken the time to endear the characters (including the croc) to  the viewers before the big action began, so the viewer would have had a  bigger emotional stake in the film.  Oliver Platt had me in stiches and  Betty White, our sweet daft Golden Girl cussing up a blue streak, is at  least worth the price of a video rental.

But  the effects pale beside those in, for example, Jurassic Park.
What sets  this film apart from many other monster films is its humor. It is very  funny at times (and quite gruesomely shocking at others). The casting of  Betty White as a sort of caretaker for the crocodiles is brilliant. Her  language is, however, gratuitously vulgar at times.

None of the characters were simpathetic in the  least.  I found myself rooting for the croc, just like Betty White.
