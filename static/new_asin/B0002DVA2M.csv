2080895,1,B0002DVA2M,"My package went to the wrong address from what is on my account that i put in at checkout, it went to my parents 8 hours away. I asked them to open it because i was excited to get it for my kids to watch, Well that is if we can even watch it. They told me that the case was very damaged when they opened the package, and that the DVD was scratched up with finger prints all over it and skips in viewing the movie.

VERY disappointed and will definitely be buying this elsewhere. so beware of that when you buy a in very good condition or good condition DVD. it could be junk!",1403481600,,575,3.956896551724138

2080897,5,B0002DVA2M,"My 2 year old LOVES the donut man! She can sing all the songs and do the motions! She's enjoyed them ever since she was 12 months old! I'm very choosy when it comes to kid's television/movies. Donut man meets & exceeds my expectations! The songs are clean & wholesome; all about praising God and learning valuable lessons (like kindness, obeying parents, etc). The music is fun and upbeat. My daughter can't wait to watch a ""show"" each day while I take my shower each morning. I highly recommend these videos to all Christian families!!",1363564800,2,536,4.652631578947369

2080899,5,B0002DVA2M,When my kids were little they absolutely loved watching the Donut Man DVD's.  We have all of the DVD's and highly recommend them to people who like good clean christian songs/shows for their kids.  Good biblical lessons and songs. My kids are now teenagers and they still love the Donut Man.  I can't wait till I have grandchildren to spoil with the DVD's,1357862400,2,355,4.603174603174603

2080901,5,B0002DVA2M,"We come back to this again and again. I go through stages of whether or not my children should watch anything as I see certain bad habits associated with sitting in front of a computer or TV. However, every time I watch Donut Man and then hear my children singing those songs I think it can't be that bad.

A few years ago I did a search online to find the original Donut Repair Club, I think I found everyone except Rob Evans children funny enough, and what I found disturbed me. From what I could gather none, or nearly none of the children were walking with the Lord in their adult years. This shows me that even being with Rob Evans doing the show is not enough. If the faith is not being taught and exemplified in the home, then no amount of religious instruction and entertainment can make up for it.

Donut Man in my opinion is one of, if not the best, Christian Children's shows. It teaches love of God, simple theology, evangelism, obedience to parents, and it is filled with fun and songs and dancing.",1341532800,5,1011,4.343915343915344

8026971,5,B0002DVA2M,"I LOVE the DVD Versions(we had VHS for years for my kids and I loaned them out yet, learned later that they sold them in a garage sale.  Anyway, the cost on Amazon is so much less, compared to purchasing them in a Faith-based book/gift store and the BEST reason to get them here is for the GREAT messages, stories and songs which can be passed onto my grandchildren (I still love the stories and songs too).
