But since Blacks weren't given a chance in Hollywood. Blacks started producing their own films, and building their own studios and showing them to the Black Community, a lot of these Independent Studios did a great job, some of the sound and picture may not be Hollywood quality, but their still watchable and worth a watch. Some of these actresses, actors, and entertainers wouldn't of never been seen otherwise, if it wasn't for these Black Studios, Hollywood missed out on some great talent, that's their lose. Great Entertainment, Great Dancing by Jeni Le Gon, who would of put Ann Miller and Eleanor Powell to shame, Jeni Le Gon would of made Eleanor Powell and Ann Miller steps look like baby steps compared to her dancing. Basically, your typical story, gangsters fighting for the love of a pretty showgirl. 60 minute movie, should of been longer. I give this a 3 because it could of had more, but even though its short, the story still gets told.",1030147200,,1157,4.732673267326732
