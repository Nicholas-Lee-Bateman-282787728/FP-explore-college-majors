6403454,1,B00K6DEQ6A,"Absolute joke that this is DVD format only! What next? 2015 is back to VHS only???
And they wonder why nobody buys anymore.
You can digitize off of cable in better quality than they offer for purchase more and more these days.
What a shame to be going backwards.
Pay for a DVD? In 2014? You must be joking.
Where the heck are all the new blu-rays?? And for a spectacular nature documentary where footage IS the movie, come on, what the heck with DVD only????
A shame, my money had been ready, no more. DVD = NO SALE.",1405036800,4,516,4.222222222222222
6403455,5,B00K6DEQ6A,"Exceptional close-up view of a modest number of Brazillian animals, which are tracked throughout the year. As is usually the case, I wish it was longer than 3 hours; some additional time would have allowed viewers at least a cursory look at a wider variety of local wildlife, but notwithstanding this limitation, this is still an exemplary program.
This was filmed with new ""4k"" ultra-HD cameras, so I am VERY surprised to see that no blu-ray version is offered.

UPDATE: It turns out this IS available on blu-ray on Amazon.co.uk; however, they have spelled ""Brazil"" as ""Brasil"".
Just type ""Wild Brasil"" in the search line and it will show up.",1404864000,21,643,4.845454545454546

6403457,1,B00K6DEQ6A,"We own almost every BBC earth movie that has been filmed....Compared to other BBC earth movies this doesn't even compare. This is definitely a step back in quality compared to other BBC earth series. Was excited to see it was filmed in 4K and had high expectations. However, I was very disappointed with the narration and picture quality. The picture quality was terrible and the scenery was sub par at best. We barely made it through the first DVD without falling asleep. The narration didn't keep us interested and the scenery and animals the DVD followed were not that great. If you were hoping for something like ""LIFE"" or ""Planet Earth"" then don't get this movie. We also had high hopes of really great picture quality but in comparison to ""Life Story"" (which was also filmed in 4K) this movie doesn't compare.

I was so disappointed that we only watched part of the second segment and we returned to amazon.

Save your money and wait for ""Planet Earth 2"" to come out.",1464048000,6,973,4.651162790697675

6403460,4,B00K6DEQ6A,"This was a good documentary. I did not give it 5 stars, though, because of the number of animals that it followed. One of them was an otter family. While very interesting, it got a little old after a while, and the noises that the otters make drove me crazy after a while. I wish there had been more animals.",1444608000,5,308,4.15

8656233,1,B00K6DEQ6A,"Despite the cover, there is maybe 5 minutes dedicated to the jaguar, much less any other of Brazil's unique apex predators, or other wildlife absolutely unique to Brazil.
Most of the footage could be captured by an amateur on a 3 day vacation.
