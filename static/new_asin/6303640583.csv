7851851,4,6303640583,"Excellent character study by Tom McCamus as a struggling actor that takes the bit role of a TV police officer a little too seriously. Only to realize the 'real law' on the streets is more corrupt and abusive than he could've ever imagine. A bit jumpy in places, and maybe a little too 'sped up' in plot devices and transformation. But all comes out at just the right length for a thought provoking and enjoyable movie.",1440720000,,418,4.5131578947368425

I really like this movie. Way back to the early 1990's I bought a lot of vhs movies on odd companies which are more known as b-movies or movies that went straight to video instead of a big movie release. A lot of these movies were released in different parts of the country...Well the movie is about a actor who plays a cop on a tv show,only thing wrong this actor is a little mentally challenged and it goes to his head and starts thinking he is really a cop and when he borrows the uniform to practice in..well I can't tell you anymore. The lovely Bridget Bako (RED SHOE DIARIES,and DARK TIDE) also stars as the love interest and more. It's agreat b-movie very dark and spooky.",1423785600,,696,4.28030303030303
7851853,4,6303640583,This movie was recommended by a Friend and I'm not disappointed. A crazy drama with a crazy character. These people really exist and the story about a obsessed man with good intentions takes you on a thriller ride. Sit back and enjoy this classic like I did.,1279152000,,258,4.51063829787234
7851854,4,6303640583,"This is a very different movie that isn't easy to find on either VHS or DVD. Unfortunately, I got rid of my tape after seeing this a few times. Now I regret it because I'd like to see it again.

""Disturbing"" is a word most often used to describe this story. A mentally- disturbed small-time actor gets a role in a show in which he plays a cop. He begins to think that is really is a policeman and begins to impersonate one out in the streets.

This is a Grade-B type production with actors that may not be familiar outside of Canada, but it gets by just fine. Tom McCamus plays the main role as ""Henry Adler."" Brigitte Bako is interesting in here, too.

If you enjoy stories about whacked-out people - and can you find this film to rent - check it out. Otherwise, purchasing this sight-unseen is okay, but don't spend too much.",1235347200,,827,4.288461538461538
7851855,2,6303640583,"The story is okay.  The movie is watchable, but if your hoping to see Bako in the flesh... don't bother buying this.  You see more skin in Strange Days, which is a better movie.  I guess the only reason it was rated R was for the very small amount of violence and swearing.  Interestingly enough in the ""Extras"" material, the movie is listed as PG-13.",1218585600,2,351,4.3538461538461535
7851856,5,6303640583,"This was an excellent film. The central performance by Tom McCamus is very tightly controlled and well-developed. Scenes between him and his father reveal a lot about the character in a very simple yet informative way. With its premise of a mild mannered man suddenly going on a violent power trip,I was expecting something more over-the-top and lurid,something closer to ""Taxi Driver"" or ""God's Lonely Man"",but MAN IN UNIFORM is actually under-played and, with the exception of a few scenes involving Kevin Tighe near the end, rather low-key. The character of Henry Adler at first seems like a typical well-behaved nonentity but Tom McCamus, aided by David Wellington's excellent screenplay and direction, invests him with an alientated sense of sadness that I found somewhat touching;I also liked how Henry's mental disintegration progressed. All in all, it makes for a very absorbing viewing experience.",1168214400,,906,5.3426573426573425
7851857,2,6303640583,"The story seemed interesting to me which is why I picked up this DVD, but it fell short of my expectations.  McCamus does a decent job in the lead role, but that's about it.  The story is about an actor who plays a cop.  He becomes so obsesses in his part that he starts acting out his role in the streets.  The scenarios that he was put in were dull and the plot was undeveloped.  Overall there was nothing new and nothing special.",992131200,2,432,4.156626506024097
