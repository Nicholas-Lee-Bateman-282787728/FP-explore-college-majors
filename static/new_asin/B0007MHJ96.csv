2220056,4,B0007MHJ96,"Beautiful color and CinemaScope print. Nota great film by any means, but have always found it very entertaining especially for the exquisite Bernard Herman and Alfred Newman score. Also found Peter Ustinov and Gene Tierney much fun to watch. Biggest draw back is Edmund Purdom in the lead, a very wooden and unemotional actor.",1127347200,6,326,5.055555555555555
2220057,5,B0007MHJ96,"Just like ""The Robe"" and ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" any trillogy of the actor Victor Mature must also include a fully restored Anamorphic Widescreen DVD ""The Egyptian.""

This masterpiece of ""The Hollywood's 1950Th Cinematography"" is desired by all USA buyers. Since this film exist only on some dismally poor import copies selling at the internet, to fill-up the gap created by ""Fox Home Video.""

Beside all that: The movie set designs build-in for ""THE EGYPTIAN"" included the most complete and acurate reproductions of Egyptian furniture and other items still assemble from the world museum collections. Though I must confess that the screenplay should have been written better for this important poque ""The Late XVIII Dynastic Revolutionary Period."" A time when very possible Moses was been educated at pharaoh's palace in Amarna Egypt.

How come The Hollywood Studios and in particular Time/Warner Inc. (that is doing a re-release of ""The Collector's Edition of ""Ben-Hur,"" following Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"") have up to now failed to release on DVD classic films like this one, is awesome for us to think or ask ""WHY NOT????."" But we assume that it's probably due only to an oversight created by those in charge of doing so in the film community. Rather than it's been done intentionally by them, there is no doubt about that in our inquiring mind. I HOPE!

Because ""THE EGYPTIAN"" released soon after ""Troy/Alexander"" and now ""The Collector's Edition Ben-Hur"" would always be a very marketeable item for sale as a ""Classic DVD Release.""

Please ""Fox Home Video"" made a DVD soon wothy of this Movie Classic.",1121558400,58,1615,5.1022727272727275
8048922,5,B0007MHJ96,"This 1954 film adaptation of Mika Waltari's novel is the second unequaled film experience. (The first is 'The Razor's Edge', 1946).
In 'The Egyptian' we find Sinuhe (Edmund Purdom) a kindred spirit to 'The Razor's Edge' Larry Darrell (Tyrone Power). Both men are drawn to the epitome of allure: Nefer (Bella Darvi) in 'The Egyptian' and Isabel (Gene Tierney) in 'The Razor's Edge'. Larry Darrell's selflessness saves him from ruin. But Sinuhe abandons friend's advice and logic and jumps in lock, stock, and every barrel.",1405814400,,521,5.141176470588236
8048923,5,B0007MHJ96,Thought you would like to know that THE EGYPTIAN will finally be released by 20th Century Fox this winter...it will however be limited originally to 3000 copies available only online from Screen Archives Entertainment,1293753600,2,217,5.411764705882353
8048924,4,B0007MHJ96,"When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside. Fortunately, the period from about 0-30 and 1:00-2:19 (The End) is excellent.

There are a number of excellent performances in this film, and an equal number of terrible ones. Just like everything else in this movie the acting is either perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov as the slimy one-eyed slave Kaptah is perfect. It is one of his best performances, up there with his role in Spartacus. Victor Mature as the ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of his best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted as Merit, the perfect girl in love with our hero John Carradine gives a nice supporting role as a philosophical grave robber; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt only to see it fall apart due to his unwillingness to fight. Now for the bad. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is sadly miscast. This is doubly unfortunate as he is the main character. The entire film revolves around him. He actually does rather good as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man. This is because of his sorely limited range. He doesn't seem able to put any passion into his words. This is especially apparent during the love scenes which are beyond awkward. He spends the last half of the film as an old man, a performance at which he is decent enough at. He does have the perfect voice for the character. The less said about Bella Darvi as Nefer, the treacherous Babylonian woman, the better.

The costuming and sets are magnificent. This is the only film that I know of that attempts to depict life in Egypt that isn't overshadowed by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th Century B.C. which is before even Exodus. The only monotheists are the pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. There is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics, but it is done differently and it only shows up at the very end. An interesting note: by having Akhenaten followed by Horemheb as pharaoh, the film completely skips over the most famous pharaoh of all: Tutankhamen. Seems kind of a strange thing to do when using that name could increase awareness of the film.

The DVD of this film is really crummy. It's a region free Asian release and the film quality is terrible. It is widescreen although it's not anamorphic. There are no Special Features and the DVD menu is just a series of clips with options in English and Chinese. At least I think it's Chinese. This film really needs an official release.

Be warned: this is a 1950s epic film. If you don't like that type of thing then don't expect this one to be different. It is different, but it is still an epic. I appreciate this film, and I appreciate what it did and what it tried to do. This is a film that should be better remembered than it is.",1251158400,,3248,4.481418918918919
8048925,5,B0007MHJ96,"This film is one of Hollywoods best for the era in which it was produced. Victor Mature is one of the lead actors and he plays the role gloriously, one cannot but believe in the plight of the lead character, the Egyptian Physician, and glory at the fantastic sets and dialogue. This film is truly a masterpiece, little known to most, but well appreciated by those who have seen it. This film also embodies philosophical and ideological commentary, both embodiments are gracefully represented, and both draw the viewer into deep contemplation. This film will not disappoint, the viewer will be moved.",1217548800,,599,4.9405940594059405
8048926,5,B0007MHJ96,"I am curious why no one has created an updated digital DVD release of the Egyptian?  Maybe because the public and critics gave it a lukewarm reception upon its theatrical release?

Of all the fifities sword and sandal epics this is my favorite.  Maybe because it was not an action flick filled with battles?  Instead it was based upon true historical events and people, Ahknaton the only pharoh to believe in only one god, and Sinhue the physician to the pharoh, who lost his love, his money, and his parents' place in the afterlife, and ultimately his true love played by Jean Simmons.

The script, sets, photography, acting, directing, and musical score are wonderful and hold up to time.  The score was written by two mega composers, Alfred Newman and Bernard Hermann.  The director, Michael Curtiz had major accomplishments with Casablanca, Charge of the Light Brigade, Sea Hawk, etc.

My one slight issue is with Edmund Purdom as Sinhue.  The producer, Darryl F. Zanuck wanted him probably as an upcoming star hopeful and cheaper than major actors.  Mr. Curtiz wanted Marlon Brando.

The public deserves a first class digital rendition on DVD.  I have only seen it on the small box tv, which is massacred for edititing for time and commercials.  I believe anyone interested in Egyptology including the story of pharoh Ahknaton the first monotheisit, would enjoy a first class release.  This is the thinking person's epic based upon historical papyrus scrolls circa 2,000 B.C.",1211328000,3,1480,4.963414634146342
8048927,4,B0007MHJ96,"This is no Charlton Heston epic, but is a fascinating and lavish color production set in ancient Egypt, for we who enjoy such films.",1185926400,,132,4.541666666666667
8048928,5,B0007MHJ96,"Oh what a movie (oh what a night)where do I begin with a movie that had so many facts correct regarding this time period in Ancient Khemet. Words can't really describe the magnitude of this film. This is basically the story of Akenaton the Pharoah that believed in the One God. But the physician Sinuway and his plight captures the true moral of the story. How one subdues the carnal passions and one goes about this process is the underlining of this great movie. Every character's fate in this movie is weighed on how they dealt with their passions.

Without giving away the plot, I must say this movie more than any other depicts true Freemasonry. You will see Hamites and the tribe of Nimrod if you pay close attention. The working tools of the physician are symbolic of the working tools of the craft (it has been said the medical profession is the only profession thought by Masons to be more esteemed than their own.)

For those who believe in the secret brotherhood of Akenaton, and, the passage of this brotherhood even up until today should pay close attention to Akenaton's last speech, as life ebbs through his body, he makes one of the most sublime and deepest speeches I think in movie history!!!

Movies and documentaries abound on Freemasonry of late ""From Hell"" ""National Treasure"" ""League of Extroadinary Gentlemen"" ""Da Vinci Code"" etc. almost giving it a commercial feel. Well put down all the rest and check out this epic classic. I find myself discovering something new everytime I watch this classic flick. I just wish this movie could be reproduced, it seems like alot less worthy movies have been restored and placed on disc why not this one, things that make you go hmmm.... Cecil B put alot of money into this film, and it was well worth it. Victor Mature plays a great heir apparent, he always acts well in movies about ancient times (see him in the biblical movie story ""Ruth""). Well I don't think it will be too many modern movies up to the caliber of this 1954 classic.",1154908800,4,1999,4.625352112676056
8048929,5,B0007MHJ96,"This is the only popular movie I know of that portray's the world's first genius, the Pharoah Amenhothep IV. Although based on Mika Waltari's fictional historical novel by the same name, the story has basis in historical fact.  Told through the eyes of the physican, Sinuhe, the movie portrays many of the historical characters of the time, Horemheb, Nefertiti, and of course Amenhotep IV, who eventually changed his name to Akhenaton.  Akhenaton led a revolution in Egyptian religion by abandoning the many Egyptian gods in favor of one god known as the Aton.  The movie shows the eventual social turmoil caused by the revolutionay idea of monothesim, virtually unknown in the ancient world with the exception of the Hebrews.  Akhenaton's genius was not resticted to religion, but was also expressed in Egyptian art and architecture.  All of this is shown in the movie through the eyes and actions of the various actors and the characters they portray.  Akhenaton's new religion was not accepted by the Egyptian masses and was destroyed by his more orthodox successors.  However, the fate of Akhenaton himself is unknown although the movie's version is just as good as any other possible explanation.  The acting in this movie was great and so were the sets and storyline. The Egyptian is a gripping tale of an unprecedented period of ancient Egypt which should appeal to young and old, male and female.",1147478400,16,1404,4.9957081545064375
8048930,1,B0007MHJ96,"The copy I got of this movie is an obvious dub from an interlaced tape. It does not show well on a home theater screen; the picture quality is less than standard broadcast. Nowhere near ""normal"" DVD quality.

But the real corker is the sound. Not only was it not stereo, but it was out of synch with the picture by upwards of a second through most of the picture. That completely wrecks the movie experience.

If you get the same disk I did you will most certainly be disappointed.

I can only echo others-- ""Fox, Where Are You?""",1144195200,15,529,4.3232323232323235
