5015415,5,B006SOE5KS,"Denis is having a rotten week. He just lost his job of 11 years. His relationship is gone stale, and rocky. His Mother, a sweet and overbearing woman, is seriously ill. With all the turmoil going on around him, what does Mom suggest? ""Get a dog."" But when Denis goes to the pound and can't decide which dog he wants, the one he finally chooses is gone when he goes back. When he finds out why, Dennis decides exactly what his modern mid-life crisis needs.

He makes his ""Abrupt Decision"" (the fifth feature from filmmaker Paul Bright) when he realizes that his creative collapse mirrors that of the dogs' dangerous lives. With some inspiration from his Mom (Cynthia Schiebel) and the reluctant support of his partner, Milosz (David LaDuca), Denis (Steve Callahan) decides that saving the lives of animals and educating people on their care is his way into a meaningful second act. You know how the saying goes, if you don't want to be upstaged in a movie, stay away from children and dogs? Despite the superb job by Steve and David, the pups are ""Abrupt Decision's"" scene stealers. But beware. Even with the cute pooches running amuck, this is a very emotionally striking movie.

In the new economy, where men like Denis can find their lives upended and discover that your expertise vaporized after 50, there are many among us who will relate to the impact of ""Abrupt Decision's"" story. As Denis struggles to find the right decisions in matters of utmost importance, you may put down the doggy treats and reach for the hankies. I'll certainly say that the film is a must-see for pet-lovers, but it also carries an intimate, personal life story.",1368316800,,1644,4.724738675958188
5015416,4,B006SOE5KS,"Great story, fine actors,  I had not seen Callahan before this and was
not let down a bit.  Even if the events in this film do not duplicate
your life exactly, it still hits home on many levels.  Relationships
can and do get stale, and the film accurately portrays this aspect
and  I hereby refuse to spoil the pleasure which you will get when
you see the film.",1365120000,,361,4.264705882352941
5015417,5,B006SOE5KS,I rented this movie because it was the latest film that he has done.. I had just watched Role/Play with him and  Matthew Montgomery . If you are a dog lover  you need to see this movie.,1363737600,,185,3.972972972972973
5015418,5,B006SOE5KS,"This movie was not an instant favorite until I watched it three times.  It is slow at the start and takes a while before the characters develop and you figure out what it's all about.  Once you have watched it a few time you will understand it fully and it is both romantic and heart warming.  The first part may tweak you a bit, but believe me, it will redeem itself in the latter part of the movie.",1362960000,,400,4.102564102564102

5015420,2,B006SOE5KS,"Let me reveal my bias for writing this review right up front.  I have a moderate collection of gay themed films and recently bought some real clunkers. So I decided to wise up and check the ratings on Amazon before buying any more.  In January of 2013 there were four, count them, four 5-star reviews of this film and no other reviews.  I skimmed the reviews and confidently ordered the DVD. I think I was snookered.

The movie is written, directed and produced by Paul Bright. Here is what he has to say on the back of the DVD jacket:

  ""I wrote this movie because I feel my generation is lost.

  We succeeded as young men, overcame the rough economic times
  of our youth, and worked harder than any generation before to build a safety net.

  Now many of our careers have crashed, our relationships grown stale, and we have
  the added responsibility of caring for aging parents who didn't face the
  challenges we do....""

Just being able to read that before buying the DVD would have given me second thoughts for sure. ""Worked harder than any generation""; ""our relationships have grown stale""; ""we have to take care of our aging parents who didn't face the challenges we do"".  WHAT? Oh these poor wreteched souls of Pauls generation!

But, on to the movie. My partner and I struggled to keep our fingers off the fast-forward button.  The relationship portrayed throughout is certainly one that has ""grown stale"" and it is very difficult to watch as it drags on and on with no apparent ""raison d'tre"" .  I had read enough about the movie to know that it would have something to do with him savings dogs but it took a long time to get there and even then, the scenes and dialogue did not ring any more true than the first 2/3 of the story.  Really, this is what American gay cinema is offering us in 2012?

The actors did a decent job but did not have much to work with and that is my main objection to this movie and the reason we found it tedious to watch. There are some threads of a good movie here and there which is why I gave it a 2.  Perhaps if I not been lied to about what a great movie it is I would have had more realistic expectations.

Now, back to the main reason I bothered to write this review.  Two of the four reviews that sing the great praises of this movie were written by people who have only written one Amazon review each.  Hmmm, that sounds a little suspicious given the quality of the movie.  Perhaps these weren't such unbiased reviewers...",1359676800,3,2473,4.381057268722467
5015421,5,B006SOE5KS,"Once again Paul Bright has delivered on making a mature, well written, well acted film.  Steve Callahan and David Da Luca are well cast as partners, who like many of us, are in relationships that have become complacent over time.  Denis, played by Steve Callahan, finds himself unemployed and his relationship falling apart.  With the help of our four legged friends, Denis finds his true calling in life.  I commend Paul Bright for once again making a gay themed movie that doesn't revolve around sex, drugs or other negative issues that seem to plague gay films.  This is a human story told with wit, charm and truthfullness.  Congratulations Mr. Bright on a future classic.",1332201600,2,676,4.885964912280702
5015422,5,B006SOE5KS,"This was a really touching, in-depth and realistic story. David LaDuca's performance as Milosz was excellent, and I really enjoyed the attention paid to the plight of neglected and abandoned animals in this film. The compassion shown for fellow man and fellow creature was really moving and I thought it was a very enlightening look at the real lives of men and women in the gay community and how much we can learn from one another.",1327968000,5,432,4.697368421052632

8503778,4,B006SOE5KS,"I really had no idea what to expect of this movie. It was rather low budget, slow to get moving, and the acting wasn't always great. At first it seemed it would be another story about disaffected, dissatisfied, depressed, people at loose ends, but the story takes more than one surprising turn, demonstrating that unexpected and sometimes wonderful things can occur, even arising from tragedy. As the protagonist of the story gains purpose and takes action, the pace gratifyingly quickens, and the story takes on liveliness and a sense of joy. Relationships develop and people are revealed to be more than what they appear, as often occurs in real life. And even if you just kind of like dogs rather than adoring them as some of us do, you will be smiling, and maybe at least a little envious, at the end of the film.",1515196800,,817,4.641379310344828
8503779,4,B006SOE5KS,"On the basis of being a dog lover, I was drawn to the film. But even though stilted and wooden in places, and decidedly low budget, the story nonetheless has poignant parts and unexpected moments of tenderness that got to me. (Who would've expected anything substantial to come from the gun-shooting neighbor lady, after all?) We see the struggles of relationships (which happen to everyone, regardless of orientation), challenges of dealing with family death, and finding meaning in life by devoting oneself to a worthy cause. All in all, it's worth watching.",1514505600,,560,5.0978260869565215

8503784,3,B006SOE5KS,"The two best things in this movie is Steve Callahan and the dogs. I adore Mr. Callahan and love dogs. I think Mr Callahan is much better at making decisions than the character.

8503786,3,B006SOE5KS,"The movie starts slow and never really reaches an exciting climax. The journey that a 40 something man takes in  finding a rewarding ""job"" after being fired is poignant and his realization that he needs to pay attention to his partner and their relationship helps make the film acceptable. I watched it twice.",1378771200,,309,4.830188679245283
