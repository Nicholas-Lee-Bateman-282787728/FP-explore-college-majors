6391650,5,B00JVFUNBG,"Only two reviews prior to my own and I am shocked at the lack of respect for this one. Yes, Warner could have added a ton more for the price but avid collectors and Woodstock enthusiastists like myself will pay top-dollar for every new or improved quality outtake we can get. That being said...from a strictly finacial point of view this edition is a waste if you already own the movie on BluRay. I, however waited until now to buy the BluRay so its all worth the cost to me. The real value obviously being the bonus disc with newly released footage of Melanie and so on. As for the previous reviewers comments about 'complete' outtakes and the Woodstock Diaries set; no offense but you obviously don't know that there is a ton of stuff that is not covered on the Diaries. I would suggest to anyone wanting more to seek out the bootlegs: Carl Simrings amazing and near-impossible to find black and white film featuring Sweetwater, The Who, Incredible String Band, Richie Havens, The Grateful Dead and others; Not to mention all the Warner archive footage that has never seen official issue. Buy this!! Buy everything Woodstock!  Enough said.",1407628800,50,1141,4.705
6391651,2,B00JVFUNBG,"Another disappointing release of this film on DVD. You would think they would at this point, include all of the previously released footage in one package. But no, you still have to buy the Woodstock Diaries DVD to have those performances. Plus there is no booklet showing what is on these discs. Disc one has no chapter listings. Disc 3 with the extra performances, the chapter listing is so small you can hardly read it. Is anyone ever going to release this on DVD and get it right? Perhaps while some of the people who want it are still alive?",1406851200,31,546,4.47
6391652,4,B00JVFUNBG,"As of June 2017, here's a quick rundown of the various North American releases of the Woodstock film and special features:
 - 1970 theatrical release (184min.) - difficult to find this shorter version of the film. 1992 VHS is your best option.
 - 1994 25th Anniversary Director's Cut (225min.) - this is the version you'll get on home video these days.
 - 2009 40th Anniversary - This is where things get confusing. This is the first time the film becomes available in HD (Blu-ray), with improved (sometimes even re-recorded) audio, as well. The second disc includes 24 additional performances, NOT in HD. Warner Brothers made deals to provide exclusive content to Target, Amazon, and possibly other companies, so they have a 3rd (and 4th?) DVD with even more performances.

6391691,4,B00JVFUNBG,"Woodstock, 1969 film

The story begins with a local man talking about the famous outdoor show put on in August 1969 in Bethel New York. Workers prepare the ground (a cow pasture) for the show. There is a raised stage, lights are lifted into position. It took nine months to prepare. Bands rehearse. People arrive on various vehicles, like old school buses rented for the occasion. Unusual costumes are worn. Some dance, driven by an inner spirit. [If you drove south on the Thruway from New Paltz that Friday evening you would have seen tremendous lines of cars waiting to exit.] The various comments tell what people thought. Accommodations quickly fill up in the nearby towns. Helicopters are hired to transport performers and their equipment. An announcer reads messages to the crowd.

The show begins with a song by Richie Havens, how life and war goes on. Clap your hands. People enter the grounds by climbing over the wire fences. Its a free concert now. Next its Canned Heat. Joan Baez dreamed about Joe Hill (framed for a robbery-murder), then sings a gospel song. The Who sing Eddie Cochranes famous Summertime Blues. A couple talk about their non-traditional lives. Sha-Na-Na sing their one big hit. A man talks about yoga. Joe Cocker sings a Beatles song and feels the emotions. Rain causes a pause that creates mud and complaints. Sliding in the mud and other acts are shown. This show will be a financial disaster. Country Joe and the Fish play music then sing. Arlo Guthrie sings about flying into Los Angeles. People pass a joint around. Crosby, Stills and Nash sing and play music. [They needed more practice.] Ten Years After sings Go home to my baby and other songs. Then the Intermission.

The new dawn brings new acts. Grace Slick sings with the Jefferson Airplane band.. Visitors comment on conditions and phone home. Its so great in some ways and so lousy in others. People walk through the mud. Is there gas for cars? A group sings. John Sebastian speaks to the crowd then sings about aging and new conditions. [Does it make sense?] Country Joe sings his big hit song. [Nihilism?] An old man complains about the crowd, he lost all his milk and the hay was ruined. Others comment on the kids. Some bathe in the pond, skinny-dipping. A surfboard in this pond? Santana plays Soul Sacrifice with its frenzied drumming. Sly and the Family Stone sing about getting higher. He asks for a sing-along at night. Janice Joplin sings about not having someone to love. [Maybe its a personal problem?] Can they feed breakfast to 400,000? The portable toilets are serviced. See you later. Max Yasgur speaks to the crowd. What does this show?

Jimi Hendrix plays a guitar in his style and sings. Recognize the tune To Anacreon in Heaven? The empty grounds look like the aftermath of a tornado, clothing covers the grounds. A man tries on discarded shoes. We see the large crowds still there. Then it ends with a view before the show. The credits roll naming the performers and the others who worked on this production. The song Woodstock was written by Joni Mitchell. At the end there is a list of people who have lived. Find the cost of Freedom? This movie is dedicated to the Woodstock Generation. Does anyone use that phrase anymore? After forty years this movie seems less great as if it has aged. [Or is it me?] Those performers are mostly a memory today. History has turned another page. NY politicians passed new laws to ban this type of concert. [I once read that some of the investors bought out the others, then profited by selling the film rights. Does that sound like show business?] This movie, like those from the 1930s, is a historical record of that era. The failure to control and collect admissions put an end to these open space shows. Its the money, not the music, thats important.",1417996800,5,3808,4.704647676161919
6391692,4,B00JVFUNBG,"I love watching ""Woodstock"". It is a movie/documentary that I never get tired of. I was only 8 years when Woodstock occured, so I unfortunately was not able to go. So watching it is the closest thing to actually being there. All the performances are top notch. If I had to pick one, which is extremely difficult, I would have to pick Sly and the Family Stone. They really got into their performance. I had picked up the swede cover directors edition that came out 5 years ago and I was blown away with it. But when I saw this new edition, with even more footage than ever. I couldn't pass it up. I want as much footage from Woodstock as I can get. And I am very pleased with this new version. If you don't have the edition from 5 years ago, then this is definitely a winner. If you have the edition with the swede cover, you need to upgrade to this version. First off, you will get quite a few extraa performances that have not been released before. But the biggest plus is the audio. I notice a big improvement in the sound. Much more clearer, and smoother than the other version. You WILL hear the difference. I don't know if the audio has been remastered, or they just were able to clean up the master audio tapes. But you will be very surprised. The transfer is the same as the previous version. Clean, and grainy, but sharper than the Dvd version. So I will recommend this new version for the extra performances and the improved audio.",1414108800,33,1440,4.337037037037037
6391693,4,B00JVFUNBG,"This is an absolutely outstanding BD, but the extras disc refuses to play in my Blu-Ray player. I literally had to find a ""download"" off the web to be able to watch the extras that I paid for. I don't want to return the disc (since it is incredible), but I've got to hope that at ""some point"" in the future, I get a Blu-Ray player that will play it properly. Maybe instead of trying to get ""cute"" with the disc menu (hence breaking it, at least for my player), they should have opted for something a little less buggy. Otherwise exceptional!",1411344000,2,541,4.313725490196078
6391694,2,B00JVFUNBG,"Besides the tightfisted policy of letting drip out new Woodstock footage only every five years or so, Warner Bros. has
done something else here to exasperate die-hard fans of this festival. The third disc in this set contains sixteen performances
touted as being never before released. Look closely and realize there are not sixteen, but only thirteen new performances: ""Mama Tried"" by The Grateful Dead, ""Volunteers,"" by the Jefferson Airplane, and ""Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine,"" by Country Joe & the
Fish--were all on the bonus disc of the 40th Anniversary set released back in 2009. I am not so sure if this was mere oversight, or calculated cheapness. Now I am happy to be able to see
any new Woodstock '69 footage at all; but by the time Warner Bros. gives us all its got, that will be the 100th anniversary edition, and also be too late, way too late. Wise up, WB.",1410825600,18,871,4.662337662337662
6391695,4,B00JVFUNBG,"I have the Woodstock 3 Days of Peace and Music Director's Cut 40th Anniversary Ultimate Collectors Edition (the Blu-ray). I bought this one because:
A. I have a scratch on the box set
B. I liked the idea of the bonus performances having been brought up to ""HD"" standards
C. More added footage in the bonus performances
C. I buy most everything Woodstock related (I know, pretty lame).

The quality of this release and the quality is very good. I wish they had improved the menu systems on this release, but they didn't. There are a few times where the surround mix is kinda wonky, imho. They'll increase the gain on the instrument that the camera pans to, which I think was the wrong decision to make. Let the music and recording stand on it's own.

That being said, the added footage from the previous version is good, but like others have said, I'm quite disappointed that they haven't come out with much more of the shows that haven't been officially released. If you haven't got the Ultimate Collectors Edition, this is well worth the money. If you do already have the Ultimate, you'll have to decide on whether the extras are enough to pull you in.",1409184000,10,1153,4.565217391304348

6391699,5,B00JVFUNBG,"Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music comes to Blu-ray in a 40th Anniversary Edition filled with bonus extras. This 3-disc release contains the 4-hour Directors Cut of the Oscar-winning documentary about the landmark music event that featured some of the greatest rock performers of the period.

The Woodstock Music and Art Fair was held on Max Yasgurs farm in Bethel, New York on a rain-soaked weekend in August, 1969. Half a million people came by car, truck, some by helicopter. Most ended up trekking beyond the impassable traffic jam to what turned out to be the most famous contemporary music festival in history, an event later hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock n Roll. Thirty-two acts appeared, including Crosby, Stills and Nash, Jefferson Airplane, Joan Baez, Melanie, Santana, Sha Na Na, The Who, Canned Heat, Joe Cocker, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin, Richie Havens, John Sebastian, and Sly and The Family Stone.

Among the bonus extras is Woodstock: Untold Stories, containing over 2 hours of 18 additional musical performances, some by acts featured in the film, some by other artists: Paul Butterfield, Johnny Winter, Mountain, The Grateful Dead.

Picture quality is amazing considering that the original footage was shot on 16-millimeter film with a wide array of lighting situations since the concert continued day and night no matter the weather. Some shots were very dark, others grainy, and still others bright and crisp. Assorted aspect ratios were used to allow split- and triple-screen images. Warner has done a great job restoring the footage to give the picture a uniformly high visual quality and taken pains to convert the original 8-track source material to Dolby True HD and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The experience is like being right there in the midst of the music.

Bonus extras also include Woodstock: From Festival to Feature, containing interviews of those who were at the festival, including concert- goers, promoters, crew, and musicians. Also included are an iron-on Woodstock patch, 3 singe-day ticket reproductions, a reproduction of an August 29, 1969 excerpt from Life Magazine, and reproductions of 1969 newspaper clippings covering the 3-day festival.",1407715200,18,2276,5.2445054945054945
