8510534,5,B0075CEQDS,"A beautiful and true story of a mother and her talented son who grew up to be a prominent Chinese composer.  It dramatically shows his mother's love and sacrifice in order to give him a better life and future despite them being born into one of the lowest social classes (in pre-Nationalist China).  And, despite his mother's pushing for him to pursue more practical academics (at least initally) rather than fostering his musical talent, the son continues to love his mother unconditionally.  If you don't mind subtitles and a few historical inconsistencies, it's a wonderful film.",1422835200,,582,5.041666666666667
8510535,5,B0075CEQDS,"Love this movie, the music is excellent, great actor and actress. Cinema photography is excellent too. When i watched at computer, the subtitle is small, after I play it on the home theater, it is much better.",1353110400,,209,4.675675675675675
8510536,3,B0075CEQDS,"Great movie, but the English subtitles are so small you can't see them quickly enough to enjoy the movie. Also, movie kept skipping about every 2-3 minutes. Other than that, the movie had great music. The actress was so beautiful. The little boy was a talented young actor. The movie theme did however jump to some scenes that had no real function for the flow of the film.",1343692800,,373,4.5
8510537,5,B0075CEQDS,"It is a biographical tale of the child hood of the worldwide renowned musician and composer Xian Xinghai. The film exposes the audience to the hard life, lack of nutrition, famine and suffering, which Xian Xinghai experience in China during the early 19th century.  The film's moving portrayal of the development of the young child's amazing talent deserves Oscar recognition.",1328659200,,376,5.266666666666667
