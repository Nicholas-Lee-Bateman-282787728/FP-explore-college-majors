2890789,5,B000SUHOEW,I love the way the stories unfold.  you don't have everyone running around nude and performing sex.  that just takes away from the plot,1353974400,2,135,4.583333333333333
2890790,4,B000SUHOEW,I love the comedy and suspense.  There is nothing like the old movies. I love being entertained without the violence and crude language,1345161600,3,135,4.869565217391305
2890791,3,B000SUHOEW,"Entertaining, Quality could be better, audio and video lacking in some cases, missing Dvd #9, but for the price and number of movies not bad.",1336694400,,141,4.68
2890792,4,B000SUHOEW,"A really nice group of films at a bargain price.

JIGSAW -Tightly-woven plot into print shop owner's death. D.A. thinks its suicide, Assistant D.A. suspects murder connected to a shadowy political organization ""The Crusaders.""

THE LADY CONFESSES - Wife missing for 7 years re-appears and then is strangled. Husband is the prime suspect but witnesses confirm his alibi. Plot thickens as another murder occurs.

THE LADY IN SCARLET - A lawyer's romantic feelings for his secretary are put on hold when he becomes embroled in the murder mystery of an old friend's husband. A tangled web of extortion, corruption, pilfered bonds and...a second unsolved murder.

THE MANDARIN MYSTERY - Skilled sleuth Ellery Queen is on the perplexing case of the chinese Mandarin, a stolen stamp worth $50,000. A dead body is discovered in a locked library, a counterfeiting scam and another murder.",1297036800,54,879,5.169014084507042
2890793,3,B000SUHOEW,"If you like collecting old mysteries, this series is okay for the price. However, Echo Ridge Home Entertainment apparently has a much looser definition of ""Digitally Remastered"" than I do.

The prints from which they copied the films on this disc vary from good to poor. The final outcome suggests they have not been ""remastered"" at all, let alone to any discernible standard.

The audio quality is scratchy at best, suggesting they made no effort to cancel background noise. They also did nothing to enhance the voice or music quality during their ""remastering.""",1293235200,97,563,5.043010752688172
2890794,4,B000SUHOEW,"By far my favorite of these is Lady in Scarlet.  Denny is wonderful in this comedy/mystery.  Lots of intrigue will keep you guessing.  Denny, remember, was the sidekick in the Bulldog Drummond series.  For me he far out shown the various leads.

The others movies aren't mearly as good and for me would rate 2 stars.",1249084800,40,316,4.571428571428571
2890795,4,B000SUHOEW,As the other Mystery classics that we have bought we like this one too.  The sound and pictures are excellent.  Just wish that there were more.  We usually watch one or two in the evening.  The choices of TV viewing is awful so we opt to watch old classic movies that anyone can watch with out fear of bad language or lewd images.,1211846400,70,330,4.190476190476191
2890796,2,B000SUHOEW,It is just alright for the price.,1494806400,,33,3.857142857142857

2890798,4,B000SUHOEW,"Collection of 1940's and 50's B movies. Acceptable quality, decently made, but don't expect any cinema classics. Definitely worth it for the cost.",1492992000,,146,5.391304347826087

2890806,5,B000SUHOEW,Excellent DVDs,1466035200,,14,6.5
2890807,5,B000SUHOEW,"Reginald Denny, as divorce lawyer, has one of the best lines ever - about how he could even get her a divorce from King Solomon!  For the bargain price this is wonderful to watch and not hear F-bombs and strong profanity nor soft core porn scenes which are in some modern films.",1460851200,6,278,4.346153846153846

2890809,4,B000SUHOEW,"Old mystery movies are yes dated, but still are great to watch if you like old movies and mysteries. Quality is not 100%, but still worth watching and how can you go wrong at this low price.",1454284800,,190,4.162162162162162

2890815,4,B000SUHOEW,This is one more volume of those glorious second feature mysteries we loved in the old days of double features.  This volume includes an Ellery Queen mystery.  Worth your while if you love old movies.,1438560000,2,200,4.685714285714286
2890823,1,B000SUHOEW,Rather disappointing and a waste of money.,1437782400,,42,5.142857142857143
2890824,4,B000SUHOEW,"This thirties movie mystery is a classic. The plot serves no higher purpose than being for your entertainment only. No nudity, no soft porn, no gore just good solid and interesting acting. The plot does have enough twists however to keep the interest level up. These old mysteries are among my favorite films.",1435449600,5,309,4.849056603773585
2890825,4,B000SUHOEW,Mildly interesting films from very poor quality prints.  Some films are pretty good and some are laughable.  Echo Bridge Home Entertainment (ebhe.com) has them cheaper than Amazon.,1435363200,3,180,5.62962962962963

2890830,4,B000SUHOEW,"THE LADY CONFESSES is a pretty good flick. JIGSAW is a decent movie. But, THE MANDARIN MYSTERY is ruined by Eddie Quillan's ridiculous performance as Ellery Queen. What idiotic casting. Quillan plays Queen as a comedic ""bumbler"" who trips over everything. The TV movies and TV series based on the Ellery Queen Detective Stories all seem like Emmy Award Winners compared to this other piece of trash.",1427155200,2,399,4.970149253731344

2890832,2,B000SUHOEW,"The film quality is inexcusably poor. We are fans of old classic film and have found thousands of very acceptable films (quality and premise) from the 1930s and 1940s. We are aware that many of these ""B"" rated movies will not be stunning intellectual achievements, but many can be fun and, entertaining. Apologizing in advance for the film quality doesn't mitigate the fault ridden film quality. At the extremely low price of these, the films are, however, worth a chance.",1424908800,3,472,4.9125

I WAS IMPRESSED WITH ALL THE FILMS BUT THE LADY SCARLET. IT WAS OK BUT NOT NEAR AS GOOD AS THE REST. FRANSHOT TONE'S PART WAS A REAL TREAT; I HAVEN'T SEEN A MOVIE ON TV BY HIM SINCE ""FIVE GRVES TO CAIRO."" HUGH BEAUMONT PLAYED A KILLER WHICH IS OUT OF THE ORDINARY AFTER SEEING HIM PLAY MIKE SHANE DETECTIVE AND HIS ROLE AS THE BEAVER'S FATHER. THE MANDARIN MYSTERY WAS DECENT ALSO WITH EDDIE QUILLAN PLAYING THE PART OF ELLERY QUEEN. THE SOUND AND LIGHTING WAS GOOD ALSO. THIS IS AN EASY 4 STAR PACKAGE DEAL...",1398816000,4,687,4.375

2890848,5,B000SUHOEW,"I love these ""Mystery Classics"". I have a number of them in my DVD library. I truly enjoy the mystery movies of times gone by. I do understand the quality of these movies are not always so perfect (and they let you know about this before the movies start), but then again, the price for them is very perfect.  Each disc holds 3 movies and that means you get a lot of movies for your ""bucks""!! I find myself watching these DVDs over and over. I'm a big mystery buff and I guess that's why these movies intrigue me so much.  I would recommend these ""Mystery Classics"" to one and all...and I have and I still do.",1368403200,12,609,4.196581196581197

2890852,3,B000SUHOEW,"The movies themselves are neat, but they are average Platinum mediocre fare, varying in degree of quality of picture and sound. Still overlook-able  in my book, but what annoys me most is the pop-up watermarks in the corner. Ugh",1356998400,4,228,4.846153846153846
