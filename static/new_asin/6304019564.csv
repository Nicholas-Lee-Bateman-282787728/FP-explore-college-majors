762723,4,6304019564,"Many years ago I owned a Columbia LP called ""archie and mehitabel"" with Carol Channing, Eddie Bracken and David Wayne as cat, roach and ""boss"" respectively. Foolishly I lent it to a student  and never saw it again. When the Broadway play came out titled Shinebone  Alley, it used all the songs from this 25 minute (or so) LP side and added  more songs of less distinction. I never heard the original cast LP of that  show at all. Since then I have hunted high and low for the original LP or  the Shinbone Alley LP with Eartha Kitt. If anyone out there has either for  sale, please let me know right quick. This video, then, was a blessing to  me in that I at least have all the songs back again. I still cannot  understand some lines sung by the chorus and Channing does tend to bury  enunciation under her singing style. So I could use a copy of the script  also. Help, anyone?",939427200,2,878,4.266666666666667

762807,3,6304019564,"This is based on the great Don Marquis's long running newspaper columns about a fictional cockroach and his impossible love for a (very) alley cat. The Marquis material, in several collections, is priceless and well illustrated by the great Herriman (of Krazy Kat). The original LP of musical material (issued in the 50s and now on CD) was very good and Channing and Bracken excellent in the roles. This cartoon can't decide if it's for children or adults (it could have been a very sleek and sophisticated ""Fritz the Cat""); what's worse the production values are Saturday morning level, the kids won't notice. The imaginative sequences really betray this. But there are several songs here that are not on the LP/CD; there are also several songs on the Bracken / Eartha Kitt complete live double CD missing on either. There was also another animated version with Tammy Grimes as Mehitibel that was released on a bootleg LP, which I've not heard or seen. But a really good stage or animated version of the source material remains to be done. It certainly hasn't dated. The ravages of human behavior are more widely recognized in popular entertainment than they were when Marquis began this tale around the time of the FIRST world war. The only filmmaker I can imagine now who would do it right would be Terry Gilliam, who might benefit from going back to animation too.",1156204800,,1368,4.8008474576271185
762808,4,6304019564,"Archie the cokroach poet first called himself to public notice in 1916 when he began leaving notes on the typewriter of New York Sun columnist Don Marquis (pronounced MAR-kwess, incidentally).

Since the typewriter was a manual model, archie had to type (quite slowly) by climbing up on top and jumping on the keys one by one.  He couldn't handle the shift key, so he used no capital letters.

Besides being a ""vers libre bard"", archie also was a raconteur, rather in the style of Will Rogers, and often told tales of the goings-on in Shinbone Alley, where he and Mehitbel the alley cat (a reincarnated Cleopatra) resided.

The columns featuring archie and mehitabel were quite popular, and were first collected in book form in 1927 (""archie and mehitabel"") [still in print], followed by more volumes in 1933 (""archies life of mehitabel"") and 1935 (""archiue does his part"").

The books were illustrated by George Herriman, creator of ""Krazy Kat"", and his lanky loose-limbed but tight style fit the characters and material beautifully.

There were stage productions in the 50s and 60s (Mel Brooks was involved in the Broadway version), with first Carroll Channing and then Eartha Kitt as Mehitabel (Eddie Bracken played archie opposite Channing.)

And then, in 1971, came this film.

The animation (except in one sequence) is simplified in style compared to Herriman's art and Mehitabel is a caricature of Channing rather than basically a Krazy Kat klone (sorry), but it captures the feel.

My own favourite moments:

John Carradine as the old-style theatre cat who saved the day for a famous Shakespearean actor (i fear i have forgotten whom) when a jealous understudy hid the star's beard just before the performance.  The cat, as he explains, knowing the show must go on, leapt to the star's aid... and clung to him throughout the performance, playing the beard.

Archie's declaration of war against humanity, in which the animation drops into full Herriman-style.

And Archie's report of his interview with a moth, trying to fathom why moths fly into candle flames.  ""Have you ever seen the beauty that exists in the heart of a flame?"" the moth asks in turn, and archie concludes:

""...and, boss, i wish there

were one thing that i

wanted half as much

as that guy

wanted

to fry...""

Wonderful film -- but do not make the mistake of assuming that ""It's a cartoon -- it's a kiddie film.""  As a quick rule of thumb, if you can't or don't want to pre-screen it, call it PG13, though i wouldn't hesitate in showing it to younger kids if i thought they would enjoy it and understand some of the issues raised.

Or, on the other hand, perhaps it ought be labelled, as a shelf card in the bookstore in one of Will Shetterley's ""Bordertown"" stories reads: ""Children and Unusually Perceptive Adults""

(To give credit where credit is due, i consulted Don Markstein's massive online reference, the Toonopedia, for the relevant dates opf archie and mehitabel's first and subsequent appearances.)",1139184000,3,2990,4.898608349900597

Carol Channing was one of my favorite actresses. Her voice is totally unmistakble. Who else could have done Romeo & Juliette with such zest? archy's wonder at the passions and the drama of life at the lowest level is a great way to comment on life at marquis' level. Flotsam & Jetsam is one of my favorite musical scenes. Music vidoes now don't reach this level of creativity. archy and mehitabel show a great lust for life even as they experience extreme hardship. I've shown this film to my nieces, who at the time were about 7 & 8 yrs old. They quickly became fans too.

762811,5,6304019564,"I decided to jot down a few thoughts about this gem of a film after viewing it the other night. I had recalled enjoying it immensely as a child, and this time I was definitely not betrayed by memory! The story is all about Archy, a plucky and bold yet intensely romantic-souled cockroach/poet, and his good friend Mehitabel the sexy and independent alley cat. You would not think that one could get so involved with animal characters of this sort, but you do, due to the fascinating viewpoints & quasi-human features of the cats, bugs, and rodents who inhabit Shinbone Alley. Although Archy and co. still maintain some basic traits which are representative of their species, they also operate as fable-esque types who satirize many human traits. Mehitabel steals the picture with her sassy, liberated philosophy of life, graceful dancing, and lively singing{ her voice is charmingly supplied by Carol Channing}. You can`t help but love her: she`s a fetching hybrid of Mae West, Eliza Doolittle, and everyone`s favorite stray cat. One of the story`s running plots involves Archy`s unrequited feelings for her, and you really do find yourself rooting for him: his wistful efforts to help her find a place as a house cat are constantly thwarted by her show biz ambitions and her many boyfriends. Despite some quarrels, the pair remain close, and this makes this the rare animated film to depict the ups and downs of a friendship. Mehitabel and Archy are always there for each other, no matter what the crisis. Highlights of the movie include gorgeous, bright visual depictions of Archy`s poems,and thesong ""Flotsam and Jetsam"", in which the pair take a joyous ride down the rivers of New York on a trash can lid. I should add that much of the material is PG in nature, but much of it will also go over a child`s head{i.e., Mehitabel`s  covert sexual flirting, a few mild alcohol references}. Also highly recommended: Don Marquis`witty and touching poems, on which the musical that was adapted into this film was based.",1024531200,14,2015,4.891812865497076
762812,3,6304019564,"Back in 1954 there appeared a short but charming long-playing record on the Columbia label entitled ""archy and mehitabel,"" which put to music some of the stories and sketches originally created by New York journalist Don Marquis. The twenty-five minute mini-production on side a was absolutely charming, and it was complemented on side b by an eighteen-minute additional series of songs and musings called ""echoes of archy."" The lp featured the voices of Carol Channing and Eddie Bracken, and was a veritable masterpiece featuring witty lyrics, catchy tunes, and outstanding performances all around.
Unfortunately, the old Columbia catalogue of musical shows has not been treated kindly by new owner Sony Music, and so ""archy and mehitabel"" has never been re-released on cd. The original production was, however, expanded in 1957 into a short-running Broadway show entitled ""Shinbone Alley,"" which featured Eartha Kitt as Mehitabel. This show included the music from the original ""archy and mehitabel,"" plus some additional tunes, most of them fairly undistinguished. ""Shinbone Alley"" was released on cd in 1993, but has gone out of print since.
Consequently, the only version of the original ""archy and mehitabel"" music and story currently available is this oddly produced 1971 animated production. The good news is that the cartoon features once again the voices of Carol Channing (the quintessential Mehitabel, in my humble opinion) and Eddie Bracken. It also faithfully includes most of the music from the original 1954 lp release, and features some charming moments in which the animation and music blend together splendidly.
The bad news however, is that overall, this production seems disjointed and at times, choppy. For whatever reasons, the vocal performances of both Bracken and Channing pale beside their 1954 originals; by 1971, apparently Channing's vocal range had contracted to the point where she had to change keys to sing some of the songs, with sometimes disquieting results. More inexplicable is that the animated presentation omits one of the most memorable numbers from the original lp production, the defiantly romantic duet between Mehitabel and her love-of-the-moment, the tomcat Bill. Finally, whereas some of the animation is imaginative in its creation of a modernistic and somewhat abstracted urban alley-cat setting, all too often the approach used during the songs themselves is to fall back upon what appear now to be highly dated Peter Max-esque psychedelic doodlings ranging from the mildly interesting to the just plain silly.
For those of us who continue to treasure the original recorded production of ""archy and mehitabel,"" our aging copies of the 1954 vinyl lp will remain preferable to this cartoon production. For anyone else interested in this still-charming urban fable, however, the animated version of ""Shinbone Alley"" currently remains the only game in town.",997574400,27,2905,5.415011037527594

talented Carol Channing,with additional voiceovers from ""THE FLINTSTONES"" veteran Alan Reed,Jr,and noted charecter actor Byron Kane,this

7859356,4,6304019564,"Here's one for the history books. Set back in 1971, this full-length animated feature was based on a Mel Brooks musical that in turn was based on the series of New York Tribune articles by Don Marquis titled Archy And Mehitabel about a philosophic cockroach and his flirty alley cat friend. The articles were first illustrated by George Herriman who was best known for creating the comic strip Krazy Kat, and his designs were a big influence on the movie. The animated film was directed by former Disney animator, John David Wilson, and done by his studio, Fine Arts Films, which most people know from the opening credits to Grease. This was meant to be a family feature, but tends to go towards more mature concepts that your average child just wouldn't get.

 Set in New York, Archy, a magazine writer and poet drowns himself in the river, but is instantly reincarnated as a cockroach with all the memories that this new life as a roach entails, including his undying love for a certain frisky feline. Mehitabel(voiced by Carol Channing)is an estranged cat who waltzes through life from one affair to another. One in particular is the gruff one-eyed tomcat Big Bill(voiced by the original Fred Flintstone, Alan Reed)who she runs off, but ultimately dumps her. Archy convinces her to give her flippant ways and settle down as a regular house cat. However, she gets dazzled by the smooth talking dramatic cat Tyrone(voiced by John Carradine)who cons her into a career in the theatre. Mehitabel soon realizes thought that she's being taken for a ride with Tyrone as he really just uses her to steal food, and doesn't approve of her turning Romeo And Juliet into a swinging showtune. She gets back together with Big Bill, which makes her into a momma cat. Archy has a poetic tangent about how he wants to raise an army of insects to fight the human scourge in a scene done to mimic the style of George Herriman's Krazy Kat, but runs back to Mehitabel after hearing about her motherhood. She has a litter of kittens rather quickly, and regrettably takes Archy's advice to be a housecat with her kids. This makes her very upset, and she kicks Archy out. After an evening of debauchery with some loose ladybugs, he comes to his senses and find he accepts Mehitabel for what she wants to be. This is convenient as she then comes back to the alley, apparently leaving her kittens in the care of her former owners, and the two friends reunite in a big music number.

This is a very eclectic ensemble as far as an animated movie is concerned. It's style is very reminiscent of Ralph Bakshi's early works, and even some of the lower grade quality that Disney was producing at the time. The music numbers are pretty good, even if all the actors aren't professional singers. It's one that's definitely worth watching, at least for nostalgia's sake. Plus it provides an honest look at attempting to make an animation just for animation's sake.",1383609600,,2930,4.707602339181286
7859357,4,6304019564,"Knowing how much I adore Don Marquis' ""archy and mehitabel"", a friend just lent me her copy of the cartoon film, PLUS a cd of the original lp. I haven't yet heard the cd, but am impressed by the lyricist's ability to make rhymed verse out of archy's free verse. That couldn't have been easy. Even so, I longed for the original vers libre words.  The wild, free mehitabel got most of the rhymed poems--songs and dances--in the book, and musically they are better.  That old feminine feline has been one of my role models since I was in my 20s (more wannabe than actual) and I was delighted with the finale, one of my favorite poems in or out of the book, ""there s a dance in the old dame yet"" -- especially since I'm now an old dame of 77.  Sometimes I think mehitabel's toujours gai overwhelming life force has kept me going strong!  Her attitude keeps our troubles in perspective, and no matter what, she just keeps bouncing back.  I was also glad to see a couple of archys ironic commentaries, the moth and the flame being a favorite, but wished there had been many more.  They are the best parts of the book.

The cartooning is, alas, dated.  They should have stuck with George Herriman's versions of archy and mehitabel--which, oddly, aren't dated--instead of trying to imitate Yellow Submarine, however admirable Yellow Submarine's artwork is.  Now and then the sixties riotous color struck me as true and joyous, but the Herriman-style revolution scenes were by far the best for their artwork, moved more rapidly, and conveyed a more antic spirit.

In summary, despite mismatched cartooning and a few other flaws, this is definitely something every archy and mehitabel fan should see and hear. No, it isn't the book we adore, but that would be impossible even in cartoon format.  Be grateful that this one is a thousand times better than that awful sixties' attempt to do Lord of the Rings as a cartoon!",1369699200,2,1909,4.635014836795253
