509526,5,6302776899,"I won't go into the plot of the film,  albeit,  it is a good one.

The screenplay is well written,  taut and full of some great twists and entertaining turns.

The acting is above par.

The editor gives this film more,  with less.  Great editing in this film.

This is an atmospheric thriller that entertains,  without boring one with useless ""needless filler"" scenes,  and is a great view for a horror fan who doesn't like the gore.

Great film.",1330128000,6,446,4.506329113924051
509527,3,6302776899,"This nifty little Australian chiller allows our favorite vomit spewer to ACT! Linda Blair plays a nurse in a COMA-type hospital where patients check in, but don't check... well, you get the cliche. Some certain doctors are performing evil deeds, but not necessarily of the supernatural calliber. The story keeps the events in realistic situations and Blair wisely underplays the terror of what she's uncovering as the outsider. As she learns more of the hospitals secrets, the dark corridors and cold personel make for a truly unnerving setting. The films climax definitely had me biting my nails as our heroine tries to escape once her cover is blown. With the exception of a brief nude scene with Blair (tisk tisk), this is a higer end made-for-television type thriller I wish I could see more of on Blair's resume. Bottom line... creepy, quick moving and satisfying.",979430400,15,869,5.0

509542,5,6302776899,GREAT SUSPENSE MOVIE. GREAT IF YOU DON'T WANT GORE. BLAIR IS TERRIFIC AS THE NURSE WHO FINDS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE TREATMENT PATIENTS ARE GETTING. SHE GOES UNDERCOVER WHEN A PATIENT DIES TO CATCH THE DOCTOR WHO PERFORMS THE TREATMENT. GOOD ACTING BY ALL.  DON'T CARE FOR LINDA'S HAIR COLOUR.

509543,3,6302776899,"Movie was OK if you consider when it was made. Probably a low budget too. Acting not so bad but action way too slow. Photography, scenography & choreography, however terrible - probably a whole movie was made on stage?  And if you want a gory horror ""enjoyment"", this film is not for you - too soft on all levels! :)",1397692800,,316,4.266666666666667

509545,1,6302776899,"This is an unbelievably slow moving medical ""thriller"" that is almost guaranteed to put the viewer to sleep. The only saving grace is the almost impossibly bad acting by everyone involved, at least that provides some measure of entertainment. The premise is simply ludicrous, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the pacing is glacial.",1376524800,,340,5.314814814814815
509546,3,6302776899,"It was kind of compelling to watch how the nurse was going to handle this situation. Also, the relationship with the other woman who everyone thought was crazy. The doctor was just plain evil. When she's trapped in the building with him, it gets really intense.",1376524800,,261,4.695652173913044
509547,4,6302776899,"I actually watched this hoping it would be typical Linda Blair b-movie action with some over-the-top gore effects screaming 80s cheese all over it. Not at all.
It's actually played straight like a dramatic thriller. The synopsis used above made me think patients were waking up missing limbs like in Vincent Price's Scream and Scream Again. Not so. The only kinda maimed they're getting in this is mentally maimed.
It's a good movie, check it out.
But fyi, my personal favorite hospital horror as of yet is Terminal Choice.",1375574400,2,523,4.887640449438202
509548,4,6302776899,"In this 1990 medical thriller, DEAD SLEEP, Linda Blair (THE EXORCIST 1 and 2, HELL NIGHT) plays a nurse named Maggie Healy. She's just landed a job as a psychiatric nurse at the prestigious Elysian Fields hospital. She soon draws the ire of the head nurse (sort of a hot nurse Ratched), while catching the eye of the head doctor. Maggie eventually learns the hospital's horrible secret, after being transferred to the ominous Ward S. After a patient's unnecessary death, Maggie quits, and files a complaint, which of course, goes nowhere. Then, her idiot boyfriend winds up in Elysian Fields for ""treatment"". Maggie must get involved after Hughe (the idiot boyfriend) meets his doom. So, she rejoins the Ward S team, this time in a snoopy-pants capacity. Can Maggie get to the bottom of things before more patients flat-line? I'm a big Linda Blair fan, and even I found her Polly Anna-like character a bit annoying. Still, I like the story, and I'm a sucker for Aussie films...",1370649600,4,977,4.821428571428571

This is not really a horror film, as what is involved is more akin to a criminal conspiracy.  The reality factor doesn't appear to be very high, in what plays like a Lifetime network drama.  The interest mainly comes from following those who are convinced that something criminal is happening, as they attempt to gather proof of wrongdoing.

Blair plays Maggie Healey a nurse who observes some suspicious practices, and patients who die mysteriously.  At first she doesn't want to become involved, but later decides to take an active role in trying to gather evidence against doctor Jonathan Heckett (Tony Bonner).  Besides taking advantage of his female patients sexually, Heckett exposes them to ""treatment"" that often proves fatal.  Blair makes a determined investigator, and Bonner does a good job of being slimy and dislikeable.
