8484094,5,B005R3SOA8,"I viewed this film on my ""cord cutter"" system in Norway.  The editorial review firstly is a spoiler . The plat or storyline of the film
was given in an empty and superficial way, which does not do the film justice. It is a drama and philosophic study about our humanity and
it is based on a great literary playwrite called John Galsworth who wrote the Forsythe Saga .
I viewed it in black and white as it is a film from 1948 and the ""convict"" is not an evil man . The death of the policeman who was doing his duty
was totally accidental and the protagonist of the film stayed about to help the injured policeman . . . and urged the woman who was soliciting to
get away. The events that happened are spoiled by the EDITORIAL REVIEW which does not do this masterpiece , of a film, justice ! Very annoying !
John Galsworthy was as important to literature as Joseph Conrad, and other contemporaries of his time and very popular. He was widely traveled and an idealist who also was interested in prison reform and better conditions for womanhood in his time . . . He was an Oxford, Great British graduate . . . and his writings are timeless and relevant for humanity.",1482710400,,1162,4.30593607305936
