6114748,2,B00GULA0AS,"Dogs is a metaphor for people. It implies loyalty or else. Darius (Andrew Howard) is the top dog who demand loyalty. His wife Nadia (Barbara Nedeljakova) a former prostitute who he ""rescued"" is having an affair. When Darius finds out....the fun begins.

The film starts out like a grindhouse with music, split scenes and graphics. The story is rather simple, but to make it confusing they use a series of flash back or flash forwards without any clear distinction. While the scenes tie into each other, it appears as if they were experimenting with the effect and as a result made it ineffective. If you are looking for a British crime film, go elsewhere.  About 30 minutes into the film it digresses into a home break-in formula.

The film was violent. The characters were never established. They were all bad guys, some worse than others, none we could root for.

The problem here is the conceptualization of the relationships between people which are rendered adolescent and crude, filled with stupidity, hate, and anger.
