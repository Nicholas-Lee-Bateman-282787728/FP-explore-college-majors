738881,4,6303952771,"THE INNOCENT is a little known movie released in 1995 and only just now available on DVD.  For those who are fans of novelist Ian McEwan stories (The Atonement, Amsterdam, Enduring Love, The Comfort of Strangers, The Child in Time, etc) then this foray into screenwriting based on his own 1989 novel by the same name will be of great interest.  Based on a true bit of history, the story takes place in 1954 when the British and Americans were carrying on a clandestine partnership in digging a tunnel beneath the Berlin Wall to gain access to the buried telephone lines that provided wire tapping of Russian communications.  The CIA agent in charge of the American division is Bob (played by a very oddly cast Anthony Hopkins) who receives the genteel and innocent 25-year-old British soldier Leonard (Campbell Scott) as a technician to direct the wire-taping mission.  Leonard is the true 'guileless fool', a wide eyed virgin on his first undercover military mission and eventually his first affair with an older German woman Maria (Isabella Rossellini), a woman with a dubious past, who eventually involves him in the murder  of her husband Otto (Ronald Nitschke) and his rather Grand Guignol disposal.  Now completely trapped by the circumstances of the Cold War and his inadvertent entry into espionage, Leonard is forced to escape to England in a way that involves Maria and Bob and the fact that the Russians discover the intrigue.  The film ends with a return of Leonard to the Berlin of 1989 when the Berlin Wall come down: the intervening 25 years have taken their toll on all concerned.

The film is very well directed by John Schlesinger and while Campbell and Rossellini are excellent, Hopkins as a brash  American CIA agent seems oddly miscast.  He is a fine actor and is able to bring off his multifaceted role well, but just seems uncomfortable and makes us feel that.  A movie well worth your attention, especially if you happen to love Ian McEwan's elegant way with words and story line.",1093132800,18,2004,4.830409356725146
738882,2,6303952771,"Set in the 1950's during the Cold War, ""The Innocent"" is a story of a young English engineer named Leonard (Campbell Scott) who is sent to Berlin to tap into Russian telephone wires.  His commanding officer, the American CIA agent Bob (Anthony Hopkins), is constantly reminding Leonard that there is danger in trusting civilians.  Bob's fear is that an American-British  multi-million dollar project used to spy on the Russians will be uncovered.  Meanwhile, Leonard, who is inexperienced with women, falls in love with a seductive German woman named Maria (Isabella Rossellini).  Bob warns him of the potential danger, but Leonard proceeds with his love affair despite the warning.  Maria probes Leonard for bits of information about his job, and when Leonard discovers that Maria has not been truthful with him the story takes a twist.
The story moves slowly and the acting has a lot to be desired.  It is not the worst movie I have seen, but far from the best. While portraying an American, Anthony Hopkins has many problems with the dialog which causes him to speak loud, abrupt, and with no emotion.  Campbell Scott tries his best to speak a British dialect and in the process is very soft-spoken.  Isabella Rossellini gives it her best shot to speak German and frequently giggles.  Personally, being a fan of the great Anthony Hopkins, I felt that his bills might have waited until he received another movie offer.",1033430400,14,1420,4.928571428571429
738883,2,6303952771,"I don't go out of my way usually to see John Schlessinger movies-somehow Sunday, Bloody, Sunday never had the impact on me, that it did on others. In fact, I always have to remind myself that Herr. Schlesinger directed  Cold Comfort Farm, seeing as I enjoyed it immensely.
Why then am I  watching The Innocent? Two immediate reasons come to mind. First, my  affinity for The Comfort of Strangers has sent me on a mission to find all  adapted Ian McEwan novels. Second, the fact that Campbell Scott stars is  something to which I immediately find appealing.
In recent years I've  decided that Scott will soon become an important American actor...his almost  genius cameos in The Daytrippers, and Big Night (which he also co-directed)  as well as his starring roll in David Mamet's Spanish Prisoner lend me to  believe the young man is indeed on his way.
The film itself,  unfortunately pales in comparison to a startling, brilliant piece of work  like Comfort of Strangers. Anthony Hopkins is miscast as an American CIA  agent, the story is shallow and uneven.
On to the next McEwan work.",950313600,5,1087,4.78494623655914

7856756,3,6303952771,"An entertaining WW2 spy romance very much inspired by the timeless classic Casablanca. John Schlesinger directs Ian McEwan's solid script (from his own novel) that does not take too many chances.

*** WARNING -- Plot Points revealed ***

The movie has the classic old man remembers the past in a 2-hour flashback structure.

A young British electronics genius Leonard (played by the American Campbell Scott) is sent to WW2 Berlin to tap into Soviet communications from an underground tunnel dug and fortified over the ten years by the Americans.

Leonard's American boss Bob Glass (played by a Brit, Anthony Hopkins) is a tough and experienced task master who frequently warns Leonard about leaking information about his super secret mission.

When Leonard falls in love at a night club with the lovely Maria (the alluring Isabella Rossellini) things take a sharp turn both for the better (love) and worse (a gruesome murder follows). Leonard is the innocent in the title of the movie who has his education coming for him in a hurry.

In a Casablanca like penultimate scene, Maria sacrifices her love in order to save Leonard's neck and opts to stay with Bob. She ends up marrying Bob and migrate to America and have 3 kids.

The final scene puts us in the midst of celebration of the coming down of the Berlin Wall in 1989. A much older Leonard -- in a coincidence that is not too clear -- again meets with Maria (but of course!).

Bob is dead and gone some time ago. Maria's three grown-up children leave the old love birds alone for old time's sakes as they climb the sections of the Berlin Wall to join the Berliners in their historic day.

The movie fades out with that beautiful Nat King Cole tune ringing in our ears. The Cold War ends but True Love never does.

An acceptable entertainment for the fans of WW2 spy flicks in which an American actor speaks perfect British, a British actor speaks passable American, and an Italian actor speaks English better than she does German.

7856757,5,6303952771,"I served in the intelligence community in Berlin in the 1950s and found this film quite verisimilar.  Only two segments failed to ring clear: (1) taking someone engaged in sensitive US intelligence activities sightseeing into East Berlin, which would not have happened, and (2) the scene near the beginning when the British Colonel Bull type complained that a swim meet was to be held in the American Sector although the British sector had superior facilities.  (Although the famous Olympic Stadium where Jesse Owens ran was indeed in the British Sector, the Olympic Pool built for the 1936 Olympics was in fact at Andrews Barracks [previously the home of Hitler's personal SS guards] in the American Sector.)
  The scene in the Resi nightclub was also quite realistic, although that facility had, I believe, closed and been torn down a decade before this film was made.  Other old Berlin hands -- both American and German -- who viewed the film also enjoyed it and found it in large part realistic.",1426723200,,999,4.9226190476190474

7856760,5,6303952771,"I like it only because of Anthony Hopkins.  I was fortunate to be an extra in some of the club and the spy recording scenes.

The film gave a good story of the operation to intercept and spy on the East Germans/Russians during the early days of the cold war, before the Wall went up.  Even after the war, the allies continued to intercept telcoms from a station built on rubble ""Teufelsberg"".  Unfortunately the screenwriting could have used more effort. As I understood it, Anthony already agreed to do the movie before he won the oscars for Silence of the Lambs, so the producers got him for cheap.

Anthony went out of his way to say hi to everyone, ""call me Tony"" and ask our names etc - even if you only got one minute with him  Isabella on the other hand, we were told not to talk to her or ""disturb"" her.  Campbell was a pompous ass who thought the world revolved around him in the way he treated everyone else.

But it was interesting to see the magic done in the way the sets really were and how it came out on film.  The way they made a hallway and several rooms look like a multi floored compound building where the the soldiers hung out and did their electronic spying. A treat for all of us was watching and listening to Tony during a break in the dinning club get up on the stage and play some classical music for about 15 mins - he can play.  I just wish the movie could have been better.  But if you like cold war intrigue, anything revolving around the 4 allies in Berlin, post-WW2, then you should see it.",1408838400,,1523,4.235294117647059
7856761,2,6303952771,I expected something very good due to the cast and the director.  I'm also fond of WWII spy stories.  The beginning was promising but after about 40 minutes I had to admit that I really didn't like it.  I came here to check out the reactions of other viewers and found that I was  not alone.  The consensus opinion convinced me that it wasn't worth watching the rest.  I'm not sure what the problem was; it seems like it should have been good.  Bear in mind that I did not stay to the end but I wanted to post my review anyway to help warn potential viewers not to waste their time.,1367107200,,582,4.142857142857143
7856762,2,6303952771,"John Schlesinger is a respected director.  What happened with this film?  Was the screenplay so awful that he was unable to do anything to save the production?  To be kind, I will describe the music score as banal and forgettable.  Did Anthony Hopkins bet too much money in Las Vegas leaving him desperately in debt?  There are no redeeming qualities to recommend this Cold War spy story.  It is entirely senseless.  We are expected to buy into the story of a woman supposedly trying to seduce a scientist to learn about the secret project he is working on.  I never did figure out who was employing her.  The film ended with me scratching my head in total bewilderment.  One can literally find made for TV movies which offer far more entertainment value.  Alas, I suffered through to the bitter end.  Please do not do likewise.  Ignore The Innocent.  Life is too short.  You have better things to do---like watching grass growing in the back of your house.

7856763,2,6303952771,"This film gets 2 stars for good production only. Fans of the book will be grossly disappointed. Anthony Hopkins was grossly mis-cast. It stays too far from the book in order to be an ""acceptable"" movie and too much is lost and twisted in the conversion. Frankly, I'd think McEwan would have enough money that he wouldn't need to sell out this way.

The characters have no chemistry with one another.

The ending is ambiguous.

For all the ""movie"" magic weaved in, it lacks drama.

A mere phantom of the book. Skip it.",1147737600,3,517,4.526881720430108
