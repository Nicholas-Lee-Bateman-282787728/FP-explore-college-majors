8299298,5,B001EPVTJQ,Nicholas Tse played an excellent role as a Japanese Swordsman going to China to acquire seven famous swords by any means possible especially through blood shed. A lot of action for those who enjoy martial arts and the costumes and scenery were top notch especially when it comes from Tai Seng Entertainment. English sub titles were very well written in regards to the spoken Cantonese language compared to other production companies that produce foreign movies.,1321488000,2,461,5.16
