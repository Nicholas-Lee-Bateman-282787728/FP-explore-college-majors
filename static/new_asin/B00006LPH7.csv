1786355,4,B00006LPH7,"I bought this movie, because my friend was in Rome filming it, and I wanted to see him in it, but also because I am 75% Italian, and I have been all over Italy and go almost once a year.  Beautiful shots of Rome really take you into the Italian feeling.  Mary-Kate and Ashley are cute in all there movies, but especially this one.  I was waiting forever for them to go to Rome!  The actor who played Paulo I am extremely impressed with, because he spoke wonderful English, and reminded me of my Cousin who lives in Rome.  The other girls, sadly enough, I could not understand one word of their English (okay, so I exagerate a little) but, in the end, it was a cute movie, so if you get around to it watch it!",1038614400,7,708,4.138686131386861
1786356,5,B00006LPH7,I really enjoyed it. I went out and bought it without even renting it first. But I liked it alot better then getting there. Marykate and Ashley Olsen are really great actors of course. Thats why I recommend this Dvd for anyone to watch.,1038355200,3,236,4.386363636363637
1786357,2,B00006LPH7,"I am not expecting much out of this movie. The other one - ""Getting There"" was bad. I read the plot of this one, and it sounds like all of the other ones. I was lucky enough to rent the other movie. I sugest you to do that. Enjoy!",1036454400,6,230,3.7142857142857144
1786358,5,B00006LPH7,"This is a really funky film!!!!! Not only is the setting in lovely rome but the girls look absolutely stunning (as usual)!!! The movie is about Charli and Leila, two girls working in some global fashion company, Its about how they go to rome for job experience or something to try and impress there boss, and of cause they go shopping at meet totally cute guys!!!!! I thought this was a wicked girlie film, totally for olsen fans!!!!",1035158400,2,433,4.564102564102564

1786398,2,B00006LPH7,"This movie was very boring. And while i understand the Olsens are getting older, they want to do more grown up material. Making out every 2 minutes in the morning is not the way to so it. The plot was unbelievably stupid. Even for an Olsen fan. I think if your a parent and want to get this, Its appropriate for kids maybe under the age of 12 as long as you don't mind them watching a lot of kissing scenes.  Any kid older than this will be bored.",1287273600,,447,4.022471910112359
1786399,1,B00006LPH7,"I've seen a lot of movies, both good and bad. This one really bites the dust. The Olsen twins have zero enthusiasm. On the bright side, all the other actors are very enthusiastic, although I have seen better acting in high school plays. I don't think the plot can get any more predictable. If I, your average citizen, wrote a film script it would probably be more interesting than this one. When, you are buying this movie you may think, 'hey at least I'll see some pretty shots of Rome'. Believe me, there were barely any, and for some reason a lot of the scenes where they are traveling around Rome seem to be filmed with a home video camera or maybe purposefully made to look that way (because the director thought it looked 'cool'??), and they are very grainy. I would just skip this movie, its not worth your time, definitely worse than other Olsen twin movies.",1270944000,,866,4.487341772151899
1786400,4,B00006LPH7,"I saw this movie on T.V. one day and thought it was pretty good. It's fun and romantic like always. Cute Olsen twins fall in love again, only this time in Rome. Great footage of Rome itself. Great movie for sleepovers or group watching.",1150761600,2,236,4.386363636363637
1786401,2,B00006LPH7,This Movie Was Extremely Cheesy  Movie. Not very good acting. Dissapointed. Not a good movie. The olsen twins other movies are good. I recommend Double double toil and trouble.,1150675200,,176,5.068965517241379
1786402,3,B00006LPH7,"First of all, i have to say that i am a HUGE fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, i watched most of their movies, but this one is just so.... I don't know what to say, it made me fell asleep.... I never fell asleep while i was watching a Mary-Kate and Ashley's movie.... This one is just really boring.... You'd better rent it instead of buying it, or you'll regret....><",1122854400,,363,4.2
1786403,5,B00006LPH7,"Another great movie by the olsen twins. i think the older they get the better the movies get. It is so good. Mary-Kate and Ashley play 2 girls that go on a trip to rome and get their first jobs. Everything goes wrong. you will have to see what happens next. The DVD has loads of extras. Including behind the scenes. some people say that mary-kate and ashley are talentless but they are wrong. Mary-kate and ashley are great actresses, their acting skills are getting better and better. This film is a must have for all mary-kate and ashley fans.",1108339200,,545,4.46
1786412,3,B00006LPH7,"I've seen most of Mary-kate and Ashley's movies so I have to say this isn't one of the best. Winning London, Passport to Paris, Our Lips Are Sealed, The Challenge were much better then this movie. This movie is missing a lot and I mean a lot of action but I could say it would be kinda fun to watch but compare to the others it a downer.",1096070400,,337,3.9705882352941178
1786413,4,B00006LPH7,"I live in Republic of Korea.
so my english grammar has so many problems//;
please understand it.
Well, I have many Mary kate Ashley's Video.
It is helpful when I studied English listening
but this is same style of Mk Ash. (ex ;holiday in the sun , winning london)
I want to MK & Ash  are act different style movies!
but I think it is helpful to Asian for study listening.
especially I offer this video to Korean.
I'd rather buy passport to paris.
It is funny then When in Rome.",1085875200,7,477,4.241758241758242
1786414,1,B00006LPH7,All i can say is that this movie is cheesier than cheese. OOOhhhh - Mary kate and Ashley get fired from a job. WOW. I'm sooooo worried now. Who gives a crap? It's the worst storyline i have EVER seen.,1082246400,4,200,4.025
1786415,4,B00006LPH7,"""When In Rome"" continues the Olsen twins world tour of movies, this time taking the girls to Rome for a summer fashion internship.
THE STORY:
It's summer and Charlie and Leila Hunter (Mary-Kate and Ashley) earn a summer internship at an International Fashion company in Rome.  Once in Rome the girls embark on a rollercoaster ride of adventure as they struggle to keep their jobs, battle off rival interns, thwart a hostile corporate takeover plot and of course engage in Romance with some cute boys.
THE ANALYSIS:
All in all, ""When In Rome"" includes all the action, adventure and romance you've come to expect from an Olsen Twins film.  It's pure clean fun for the whole family.
THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:
Like most Olsen DVDs you've got a stuffed DVD features section, but unfortunately most of it is fluff.  Included in the DVD special features are:
1. Behind the Scenes mini-feature:  9 1/2 minute feature where the cast and crew (primarily the twins) talk about the movie, their experiences filming it, the various characters in the film and their experiences touring Rome.
2. Alternate ending.  I actually this ending better than the actual one...
3. Trailers:  The Multi-million dollar Olsen marketing machine was in full force here!!!  The twins shill the following from their extensive product line:
a. ""When In Rome"" Movie Trailer
b. ""Sweet 16"" Videogame
c. ""When In Rome"" Soundtrack
d. Their extensive DVD/Video Catalog
e. Their ""So Little Time"" tv series action dolls.
f. Their line of books
g. The ""Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action"" cartoon series on ABC.
h. Their website ""MarykateandAshley.com"" where you can get all the latest information!!!
i. And finally and a ""non-related"" trailer, the trailer for the Scooby Doo movie (????)
THE VERDICT:
In all, overselling in the DVD features aside, the movie was great for a family viewing on the weekend.  Olsen fans should love this installment in their ever-growing ""world tour"" video franchise series and parents should be pleased with another clean, quality product from America's favorite twins.  Overall, not a bad addition to their franchise and a fine choice to add to your Olsen collection if your so inclined.
GRADES:
Film:  4 stars
Extras:  3.5 stars
Overall:  3.75 stars
Highly Recommended",1063497600,12,2256,5.03494623655914
1786416,2,B00006LPH7,"you have 2 girls who are interning in italy for a job in fashion. They meet boys, mess up their intership and have fun. This movie feels like something from the 1980's. Very mild and laid back. Nothing fancy or exciting, just mild. I think it's time for the olsen twins to change when it comes to their movie stories. This is good for teens who need good role models.
I will always admire them for staying so child like. You have to in a world like this.",1056672000,3,454,4.170454545454546
1786417,1,B00006LPH7,"I've never writen a review before but this ""movie"" moved me to act. One star is too good for this pre-teen dribble. My 7 y/o daughter loved this movie but I developed sea sickness. Not only is the story line unbearable but camera bobs side to side, up and down as if the camera man is drunk. Did Mary-Kate and Ashley take artistic control of this movie intending to be modern day Hitchcocks? The fake accents are worse than Kevin Costner's in Robin Hood. Who would admit to writing this..someone who needed the money, has reads the articles in vogue, and graduated from middle school.",1056326400,2,584,4.571428571428571
1786418,5,B00006LPH7,"The plot in this movie is very silly, but nevertheless entertaining.  Their clothes are adorable, the boys are adorable, it is somewhat educational, and very appropriate for any age.  Mary-Kate & Ashley deserve much credit for keeping their story lines appropriate, but not totally juvenile. The movie is really cute and makes you want to go to Rome! Paolo is especially entertaining with his...interesting...english accent that is very haha so and there are some silly momentos.  I definatly recommend this movie for anyone like 7-15 so please buy it!  You will not be dissapointed! :)",1053907200,2,586,5.136842105263158
1786419,2,B00006LPH7,"Once again,this is quite an unrealistic movie, the typical Olsen twins movie theme is quite apparent- teenage girls galavanting in diffrent locations around the world, hence the title 'When in Rome'. I do believe their list of exiting new places to film their movies must be shrinking, just as my enthusiasm about their movies these days. Its been the same ol same ol for about 5 movies now- the girls travel to some vacation spot and find boys....puh leez...Spare me before they come out with a movie called ""Make out in Manhatten"" !! I just could not pay attention watching this one, its defenately not their best.",1050796800,,616,4.766355140186916
