7204568,4,B00XZKQC6S,"Great documentary, but I wish there were more performance sequences. It seems the director is not really interested in the music, but in the personal struggles of the competitors.",1439424000,,179,5.206896551724138
7204569,4,B00XZKQC6S,"This documentary on the Cliburn Competition was almost everything I was hoping it would be.
It is a good look at that competition that primarily focuses on the competitors.
There has been some criticism that it fails to render longer time sequences of solo piano playing, but had the producers done that the pace of the film would have slowed almost to the point of boredom.
It would have been nice to have had more on what the staff goes through to put this event on, such as how the initial video applicants are handled & judged, what the piano movers and tuners have to go through, and how the judges are selected.
The scenes with the journalist critics from the various newspapers/media should have been eliminated all together.  They brought nothing to this film and it was a waste of time, effort, and money to have any of them appear.
The backgrounds and clips of the competitors as children were a good touch, but I really wish the interviews with them would have asked questions about how they structure their practice sessions then and now.  I.E., how many pieces do they work on in a single practice, what is their practice routine, and how do they craft a given piece. It appears the best that the writers could come up with was, 'did mommy have to make you practice' and 'how long do you practice'.
There are other aspects to the Cliburn that it would have been nice to have brought to the fore which are not even mentioned here such as the amatuer competion and educational programs.
Also enjoyable is one of the supplemental special features on the DVD that shows what the competitors are doing with themselves some months after the event.
Noteworthy is the well edited sequence where the same piece was played by multiple pianists.
Overall, this is very much an enjoyable movie especially if you have an interest in playing the piano.",1439337600,2,1850,4.637195121951219
7204570,1,B00XZKQC6S,"I just finished watching this film on TV, at least as much of it as I could stomach. It's a film designed for people who wouldn't actually want to hear any of the performances.  The whole thing is an over-produced collage of 5-second snippets demonstrating the conceits of the film director but little else.  Any music that does occur in the film is overdubbed with conversation.  Part of it is in black and white (which is just oh so artistic).

There was a film made of the finalists of the 2009 van Cliburn and it was a fine presentation of the lives and experiences of the finalists, with some extended excerpts of their performances.  It gave a real feel for what it was like for everyone concerned.  Don't waste your money on this latest one, though, as it's really all about the film director rather than the performers themselves.",1438732800,,838,4.590604026845638
7204571,1,B00XZKQC6S,"My husband and I are both pianists and we looked forward to watching this documentary on PBS which aired on July 31, 2015. We are familiar with other films made of this world-famous Van Cliburn piano competition. The repertory requirements are rigorous: many individual pieces, playing with a chamber group if you advance to the semi-finals; and performing a concerto with an orchestra if you make it to the finals.

Human interest soundbites monopolized the hour and a half film as we waited to hear individuals play long enough to be able to discern differences among them as pianists and as musicians. Way too much footage was given to two particular pianists whose facial grimaces detracted from the music they were playing - and there were FOUR separate instances of the same pianist grimacing through a piece that even a third-grader could play (Chopin's ""Raindrop"" prelude that Jack Nicholson played on the back of a truck in the movie, ""Five Easy Pieces.""). The redundancy of that Chopin clip illustrates the filmmakers' naivete while denying us the ability to discern true talent.

So, I guess this was journalism with all the human interest stuff and glitzy film pyrotechnics superimposing images of multiple pianists playing the same piece. Pianists don't play pieces the same way as suggested by the montage - and we don't get a chance to hear the differences. There was so little footage of individual playing that it was virtually impossible to glean why the First Prize Gold Medal winner was chosen.

Perhaps this film was what the Van Cliburn foundation wanted as PR. Too bad they forgot the piano playing that everyone wants to experience in the first place. It was produced by people who aren't pianists - and I was thinking that if Van Cliburn were still alive, it wouldn't have been allowed to happen for sure. This film was a true disappointment of an opportunity missed.",1438387200,5,1892,4.90625
7204572,5,B00XZKQC6S,"This disc celebrates the 2013 Van Cliburn Piano Competition held at Fort Worth in Texas every 4 years. The documentary charts the progress of a decreasing number of competitors over the period of the competition with plenty of background material. The bonus feature showcases 3 short pieces (of considerable difficulty) played by the three finalists, one each.

The word celebrates has been carefully chosen in the opening paragraph because that element of celebration is what comes over most strongly during this documentary in contrast to what so easily have become something more to do with competitiveness.

The lack of obvious competiveness is constantly apparent between the competitors and that may have something to do with the advice they are given by the judges. Crucially they are told that any form of playing to the audience will be heavily penalised. The emphasis must be upon the player playing in a totally focussed manner which demonstrates their absolute identification with their own music making regardless of any exterior considerations  and that must be other competitors by implication. Musical character is a prime ingredient in this competition with technical excellence being a given attribute.  As stated by one judge, this is not entertainment.

In the course of the documentary we are introduced to family members who deepen our understanding of all that goes into a player reaching this level of achievement at such usually young ages. Matters such as choice of (female) dress are also explored. The interviewer is able to ask quite invasive questions in a manner that establishes an easy-going relationship with the interviewees.

This style of enquiry allows the viewer to share in revealing desires and inter-personal details of the candidates without feeling uncomfortable. This is true even when interviewer retractions and withdrawals prove to be essential as discomfort and even tears are the unexpected results. This is skilled interviewing of a sympathetically probing nature.

The disc offers excellent DTS master Audio 5.1 as well as PCM stereo. The camera work is probing without being invasive and the imaging quality is uniformly excellent. Subtitles are available in English, German and French with the documentary language being English. The booklet is informative and interesting. The bonus features offer a 6 month later revisit of 6 pianists as well as the individual pieces played by the three winners. These are a Liszt Transcendental Study, Ravels Scarbo and Scriabins 5th Sonata.

In summary this disc offers an absorbing and sympathetic insight into one of the worlds most prestigious piano competitions. It may well repay repeat viewings unlike many musical documentaries which is further testimony to its quality.",1437091200,2,2769,5.364055299539171

7204574,5,B00XZKQC6S,"What a great beginning to the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival! This documentary from the United States, Russia and Italy takes us to the 2014 Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, Texas. This event takes place once every four years and attracts the best young talent in the world. Director Christopher Wilkinson (""Copying Beethoven"") has crafted a film that shows us the humanity of the performers, explores the wonderful world of classical music and offers humor at every turn.

We become acquainted with a dozen or so young pianists, all of whom are protges in their home countries, all of whom speak surprisingly good English (the sound is excellent and we didn't need captions), and all of whom approach the competition in distinctly individual ways. Each is allowed to select his or her personal choice of Steinway for the competition.

Their interviews are insightful and humorous. For example, the young man from Russia is never nervous, the young man from Italy always wears blue underwear, the young Ukrainian has connected with his long-missing father through Facebook, the young Italian woman likes to practice with her dog in the room; as a result of these interviews, we end up rooting for each and every one.

The judges are equally various: Several of them feel art is so subjective it's impossible to select ""The Best""; one feels his readers like to be entertained by his reviews, so is witty and brutal in his assessments; one is careful to judge solely on artistic merits and completely avoid any personal or hurtful observations.

The editing is marvelous! As each pianist competes, we see his or her name, the name of the piece and the name of the composer. There are times when there are six screens with six competitors playing the same movement of the same composition, fingers and arms moving in unison.

I'm glad I didn't have to pick a winner!",1434585600,2,1895,4.927899686520377

8717193,5,B00XZKQC6S,"Virtuosity is a video for anyone who is interested in competitions. The video shows some of the upper contestants in their homes in Italy and other countries. It helps understand where each one is in the state of his/her life. These interviews intertwine with the performance of a few students.
I had a personal interest in the Cliburn because I attended the very first of the Cliburn Competitions. Our piano professors at Okla. City University School of Music took a selection to Ft. Worth. I met Van Cliburn at that time. It helped me be involved in the video.
I recommend this video tor anyone.",1459036800,2,597,4.695238095238095
8717194,5,B00XZKQC6S,Loved it. Great documentary showing a real behind-the-scenes look at the Cliburn. Very well made.,1456963200,,97,5.533333333333333
8717195,4,B00XZKQC6S,"I enjoyed this film. While it was a documentary, it played a little more like a contemporary movie. I wish they would have focused a little more on the music and less on a girl collecting thousands of decorative frogs, but I understand the director was trying to make the viewer feel attached to the performers. It worked, and there was one scene in particular that was heartbreaking (no spoilers).

Overall this is a great introduction to the Van Cliburn competition series, but if you're already used to seeing the competition documentaries you may feel a little annoyed at the artistic liberties they took with format.",1453593600,,621,4.8584905660377355

8717201,5,B00XZKQC6S,"As I post this review  having just watched the BD last night (and loving it)  I see quite a few reviews before me  some fairly detailed  so I will try not to repeat what they have written already.

Like many documentaries where there is a time line  in this case the full run of the 2013 Van Cliburn Piano Competition in Fort Worth Texas  the director has to follow the contestants through the semi-finals and then the finals, not knowing who will win. He does not know what health issues or personal problems may happen. He just records it all and hopes for the best. And I think he was pretty lucky this time to decide which young pianists to follow. As you will see he learns that one participant has recently found his birth father and they meet for the first time in 23 years.

This is not necessarily a film just for classical music lovers. Yes, they are playing classical pieces but the film does not include full performances and  as another reviewer pointed out  the editing is done so you will hear one piece played by as many as 6 different players. And it is the director who does the interviews with the contestants and his questions bring some humor to the film as well as giving each contestant a distinct personality.

For those who want to hear full performances, there are the bonus features which add an extra 40 minutes to the 90 minute film a reason to watch the DVD or BD rather than streaming the film. The bonuses include a six month later section showing life after the competition.

I like classical music but I don't consider that my favorite musical form. But I love human interest documentaries and I really loved this one.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
