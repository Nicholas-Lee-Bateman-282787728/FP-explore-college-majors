2930772,2,B000TRTV1S,"I bought #1-3 of this classic collection and you would think by now there would be subtitles/CC. Even with the sound as loud as it could be and running at slow speed I could not catch a lot of the of the lines. This is not only frustrating but you miss some of the plot/clues. Needless to say I am returning #2 & 3. I agree with the other reviewer, there could have been better specials. Show 5+ but no CC 0.",1250121600,16,408,3.9878048780487805
2930773,5,B000TRTV1S,"David Suchet's portrayal of Poirot is the best ever.  I enjoyed this set and every episode.  I'd seen these on A&E television, but still enjoy them every time I watch.  The only downside of these DVDs are the ""Special Features"" - the biographies are short texts only.  So in my view, there are no ""special features"".  Also, in these DVDs one can tell when the commercials were inserted for television.  I'm sure that much footage was lost when they edited these for television.  Still, this series is done so well - the settings and attention to detail and the acting is superb.",1249603200,2,578,4.607843137254902

David Suchet has portrayed Poirot excellently. I do not compare the movies to the Agatha Christies books. I have not read the books but will someday. I enjoy setting down at days end, plugging in a DVD of Poroit and engulfing myself in a life style of England and the world of years ago. It is hours of entertainment that I can watch over and over.

2930786,4,B000TRTV1S,"My family and I love the Poirot series with David Suchet.  The A&E movie series have closed captioning (most of them, anyway), the Acorn series do not.  My wife is about 98% deaf, and I sometimes have a hard time understanding the words because of the accents and/or background noise in the show.  Closed captioning is a must with today's technology.

2930787,5,B000TRTV1S,"Ever since David Suchet's Poirot debuted in the early 90s, my wife and I have been rabid fans. We wore out our VHSs of the shows and happily acquired the DVDs in the early '00s--which we still look at regularly. We have all 36 short shows, and most of the movie-length shows. (The later movies aren't as compelling for us, because they lack Hastings, Japp and Miss Lemon, who lent so much humor and character to the shows.) The well deserved 5 stars are for the scripts and the actors and the production values. They're all brilliant. However, there is a caveat with these Poirots, at least as it relates to the Acorn editions from the early '00s: The transfers on the disks we own are poor. Grainy, muddy, with an odd pinstriping effect. I hope acorn has fixed this. But if not, you should know what's coming your way.",1269043200,17,819,4.466666666666667

2930790,4,B000TRTV1S,"Hercule Poirot is a fussy, brainy little Belgian with a mild case of OCD and a highly waxed mustache. He seems like an unlikely detective.

But ""Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Classic Collection - Set 1"" brings together nine episodes of the classic Poirot TV series from ""Mystery!"", and demonstrates why he's Agatha Christie's most endearingly eccentric detective. These are solidly written, self-contained little mysteries that are truly and deeply baffling -- and the cherub-faced David Suchet is absolutely perfect as the fussy little man with a steel-trap brain.

""The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim"" becomes the source of a bet between Poirot and Chief Inspector Japp, when a wealthy banker goes missing -- Poirot bets five pounds that he can figure out the case without leaving his apartment. An aristocratic ""Veiled Lady"" hires Poirot to recover an incriminating love letter from a blackmailer, and ""The Lost Mine"" becomes a matter of concern when a Chinese man is cruelly murdered in Chinatown, and an opiate-addicted stockbroker seems the best suspect.

Then Poirot is confronted by a ""Cornish Mystery"" when a woman asks him to see if her hubby is poisoning her... and sure enough, she turns up dead. He considers retiring until ""Double Sin"" comes into play -- a young woman with a valuable collection of miniatures, which are stolen en route. And when a young couple gets a luxurious but inexpensive apartment in ""The Adventure of the Cheap Flat,"" Poirot is intrigued -- and uncovers a gruesome mess of Mafia plans, FBI stakeouts, and a treacherous American sailor.

Then there's the ""Kidnapped Prime Minister"" -- guess what it's about. The Prime Minister and his secretary have been kidnapped and Poirot has only a matter of hours to avert war. ""The Adventure of the Western Star"" causes trouble when Poirot meets Belgian movie star Marie Marvelle, who is being haunted by bizarre letters about a giant, allegedly cursed diamond. And ""How Does Your Garden Grow"" has Poirot investigating in a London flower show, one of whose patrons ends up dead...

""Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Classic Collection - Set 1"" is an enjoyable mystery series -- it has the classic flavour of a cosmopolitan, early-twentieth-century England. Poirot's cases take us into sleek deco apartments, smoky nightclubs, lush rural settings, mossy citadels, opium dens and murky seedy streets, and somehow seeing the dapper little detective glide through his cases makes them seem both difficult and easily unraveled.

And the writers do an excellent job of translating Agatha Christie's stories -- jewels, murders, thefts, kidnappings and blackmail, tangled together with clues and the odd action scene (which Poirot doesn't really take part in), and even one story where the FBI starts horning in on the case. But while most of these stories have a grim undertone, there's also some wonderfully witty dialogue (""Please, do not fraternize with that creature. I am still training him."" ""It's only a parrot."" ""I was talking to the parrot"").

Suchet is pitch-perfect as Poirot -- short, twinkly-eyed, a bit chubby and with a neatly waxed and perfectly trimmed mustache. He really makes you believe that this guy's innocuous, tidy appearance masks the steely brain of a truly brilliant detective. Hugh Fraser is a wonderfully mellow, somewhat naive sidekick for Poirot, and Philip Jackson is equally charismatic as a down-to-earth Scotland Yard cop who often finds himself working parallel to (or with) Poirot.

""Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Classic Collection - Set 1"" is a solid and enjoyable string of classic Agatha Christie mysteries, like gleaming beads on a very strong, knotted string. Definitely worthwhile!",1255564800,29,3694,5.217537942664419

There is a variety of accomplished actors that fit the roles very well.  All in all, the videos are well written, well acted, filmed in realistic locations, and very professionally filmed.  We enjoyed it very much.

Getting nine episodes for only slightly more cost than the three-episode sets are offered at puts this great product in range of most everyone's ability to purchase. My video is intended to show the look and feel of the DVD menus and the feel of the series itself. The Poirot series is excellent. Whether you are a mystery fan or not you will find yourself fascinated by this character. Poirot is a man obsessed with details.  When you first see him it is evident that he is absolutely meticulous about his appearence and grooming. In one episode, he sits in a barber's chair and as the barber approaches him Poirot admonishes the barber for having made one of his side burns a fraction of an inch shorter than the other at his last visit.  Later in the episode we see Poirot gazing at his hair in a mirror as he asks his friend and associate Captian Hastings

""Do they look symmetrical?""

Hastings has a wonderfully befuddled look on his face as he answers'

""The side burns?  Yes, of course.""

But Poirot being as finicky as he is has got to be sure, so he says;

""You can be frank with me...""

And with an even more hapless look on his face Hastings answers;

""I was being Frank!"".

Perfectly coiffed and groomed and wearing the finest silk vest, pocket watch and chain and elegantly tailored jacket, pants, hat and shoes, Poirot proceeds to take on mysteries that have Scotland Yard scratching their heads. It is perhaps his intense obsession with detail that makes Hercule Poirot such a great detective. Offering his services as a private investigator and often aiding Scotland Yard's Chief Inspector Japp, Poirot deals with cases as varied as murder, kidnapping, grand theft, blackmail, and even taking on mafia hitmen. This is not a bloodless series. In fact, some scenes are very disturbing indeed. One scene in particular comes to mind as a young woman is stabbed to death in her private cabin on a train, it is a brutal murder and is on full display as the villain stabs her in the chest while covering her mouth to prevent her death screams from alerting other passengers, and we then see her pressed up against the window of the cabin as a vicious blood stain spreads across it. Later she is discovered dead, having been shoved under the cabin seat. It is this clash of the brutal world of murder and intrigue with the quaint fastidiousness and intellectual approach of Poirot himself that lends power to the series. David Suchet as Hercule Poirot brings such depth, passion, and humor to his character that you can't help but be drawn to the sheer enjoyment of watching his peculiar habits and quaint French-accented mishandling of the English language as he goes about unraveling the the threads of these mysteries.  The locations and sets in this series are perhaps the most lavish I have ever seen in any televison production.  From the perfectly rendered cars, architecture, dress and hairstyles of the late 1920's and 1930's, to the exquisite estates and hotels with polished brass, beveled glass and richly appointed gardens, this series seems to have had a very wealthy budget for such impressive decor and detail. The look and feel of it is remarkable.  No details have been spared.  It is as if you have entered a period of time nearly 85 years ago, even the extras are dressed to perfection. But Poirot is not the only character that brings great feeling and depth to the series.  Chief Inspector Japp in his trademark trenchcoat and big hat with his thick slightly droopy moustache and desire to move things along quickly presents a fine foil for Poirot who takes his time, is careful and thorough and finds many details that Japp, in his desire to get things resolved quickly , overlooks. But they are not professional adversaries, Japp and Poirot many times work together and respect each other's abilities. Captian Hastings, called so for his rank during his former service in the British army, is a friend and aide to Poirot who assists him on most cases as a second set of eyes to watch suspects and gather certain information for Poirot. He also helps keep Poirot abrest of current events in the news, provides Poirot with a revolver when necessary is handy in a fight when situations get physically rough. Hatsings is himself a charming character, a gentleman who has a fascination for beautiful women, fast cars and racehorses. And there is Poirot's attractive secretary and friend Miss Lemon.  She keeps Poirot's office organized, makes sure that he is not late for his appointments and offers her own views from time to time on Poirot's cases. Poirot has taken her on some cases when he meets with suspects and to help him perform subterfuge or act as a decoy to help him gather information.  Despite his meticulous behavior , Poirot is not beyond occassionally breaking into places in the dead of night when it seems there is no better option, and we even see him in disguise on occasion as he looks to gather information. This is a series that should not be missed. It is an elegant high class production from the opening frame to the closing credits. The DVD's themselves worked well and delivered clear stunningly beautiful images and sound, although I found one very minor thing annoying about disks, there appears to be some coding on the disks that prevents the DVD player's stop-button from being engaged until the episode is actually playing. In other words I found that I couldn't simply press ""stop"" when the menus to select the episodes were being displayed.  It's an odd thing, but not very important. Anyway I highly recommend this series, it is well worth the investment.
