8606316,5,B00EKFI1BG,"It's a minor tragedy that this sharp-witted program met its demise just when the writers and characters had realized their full potential. While retaining the show's trademark vulgar yet smart humor, this final season also manages to pile on emotional, existential, and ethical angles that stir the cerebral cortex. I was somewhat taken aback, actually, by how well season 5 was able to manipulate my mood and thoughts in comparison with both earlier seasons and other serials.

This is an example of a show that improved as the seasons progressed, which is an all too rare phenomenon in television. For me, the early seasons were marred by Robert Sheehan: his character was (more often than not) annoying rather than funny. Although it was bittersweet to see most of the other protagonists (and the probation officers) get killed off over the seasons, their replacements eventually more than made up for the losses, as proven by series 5.

Each episode in series 5 contains a brilliant plot of its own that still manages to contribute meaningfully to the overarching story. The scripts nailed it, the actors nailed their scripts, and the cinematography was spot on. Very sorry to see this little gem of a show go away.",1428883200,3,1219,4.941463414634146
