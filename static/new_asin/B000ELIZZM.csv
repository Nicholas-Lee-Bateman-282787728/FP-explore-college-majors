2522003,5,B000ELIZZM,I have been waiting forever for this! It's finally here. I can't wait for all the seasons to be released.,1140652800,8,105,4.3
2522004,5,B000ELIZZM,"I could not believe that it has taken so long for this wonderfully funny and touching show to come out on DVD.  I was so excited when it finally showed up on Nick at Nite and TVland but hated when they stopped showing it. Some of my favorite episodes are when ""Miss Jenkins"" returns and Brian gets an ""incomplete!""  Also, when Brian thinks Fay is the killer from Most Wanted.  I can't wait to get my own personal copy and not be at the mercy of the networks!!!",1140652800,6,460,4.204545454545454
2522005,2,B000ELIZZM,"The show gets 5-stars easily. I've waited for years for this and was thrilled when it was finally announced it would be released. I ordered in advance and and felt like a kid waiting for Christmas! When I put it in the DVD player and started it, I was, well, surprised...unhappily surprised. The video quality is out and out POOR; it reminds me of a worn out VHS tape. Video quality aside, there's no special features, not even subtitles for the hearing impaired. As for the cover artwork, I've seen better work from kids off their home computers. Disappointing all the way 'round.",1133222400,8,581,4.650485436893204

2522008,4,B000ELIZZM,"""Wings"" was a series ahead of its time, two brothers (Tim Daly & Steven Weber) run an airline in Nantucket, MA and deal with their coworkers who are also their friends. Among them is a talented cook Helen (Crystal Bernard), an idiot-savant mechanic Lowell (Thomas Haden Church), their pompous rival Roy (David Schramm) and the haughty but well-meaning Fay (Rebecca Schull). In the first two seasons you'll see hilarious scenarios such as Brian trying to win back his ex-wife, who was originally Joe's fiancee. The gang spending time with Fay on Christmas and a hilarious rendition of ""Winter Wonderland"", Brian dating a police officer to keep Joe out of jail and even Helen trying to be a famous cello player. The video quality is not as superior as it should be, in fact no HD remaster exists. If you're looking for that then keep the CBS DVDs, but if you desire to own the series for the first time then you'll want to buy up this combo pack. ""Wings"" is high-flying fun, and very high-spirited.",1481414400,,996,4.6971428571428575

2522011,5,B000ELIZZM,"Wings gets 5* review primarily for Season 2's introduction of a few new characters.  Enter Tony Shaloub as the morose taxi driver Antonio Scarpacci and the dry (dimwitted) character Lowell wonderfully played by Thomas Hayden Church.

Season 1 and 2 make up some of the finest television viewing of the time.  It's not wonder they garnered so awards including three Emmy nominations.  This is complete fun.  Put it on and enjoy it for what it is, great comedy.",1467936000,,459,4.833333333333333

2522015,4,B000ELIZZM,This is a wonderfully written and performed sit-com. It loses a star for putting Tony Shaloub's picture on the cover even though he appeared in only one episode in the minor role of a waiter.,1449273600,,191,4.485714285714286
2522016,5,B000ELIZZM,"Great playing quality, as good of quality as one could expect from an early 90s analog master recording.  These discs each have a ""Play All"" option (thank goodness, I hoped they would) and a ""Episode Selection"" option.  No extras- no outtakes, deleted scenes, etc.  The discs all come stacked in one case.  No frills, but if you just want the episodes, including the missing ones Hulu and Netflix don't/didn't have, then this is what you'll get.  Not a bad price at all for some great memories of a really funny and underrated show.  If it weren't for Seinfeld (of which I am also a HUGE fan) being on the exact same years, Wings would've gotten much bigger accolades.",1439078400,2,668,4.61864406779661

Yes the video quality is not that great but but some of the episodes are fine..  You will still enjoy the show because the sound is clear and you can follow all the punchlines.  It's a full frame screen and with my big tv adds to my viewing enjoyment.  There is one episode missing on season 2 where Joe was curious on what's in Helen's purse.

I was upset that the DVDs were not closed captioned and feel that that information should have been listed on the information. Since this set is not Closed Captioned it's not as much fun to watch, nor can I watch it with the volume set on low.",1391212800,,338,4.059701492537314
2522066,5,B000ELIZZM,This is my favorite show all time. The picture quality in the first couple of seasons are bad. They look completely like standard quality. However its not the dvds its the show itself. Having watched these episodes on netflix and on tv  the picture is the same. Bad quality in the early seasons but by season 3 it was looking much better. speaking of netflix there are about 20 episodes missing from the entire series. You can only get those episodes on these dvds. there are about 3 or 4 episodes on this set alone that are not on netflix.,1389830400,5,540,4.4

2522068,3,B000ELIZZM,"I love this show, my only problem with it, is Crystal Bernard, I can't stand this woman.  She was so ""weak"" compared

2522069,3,B000ELIZZM,"Wings is a top notch program with a great cast, but I found the video quality quite subpar on this DVD. Also, the lack of any closed captions or subtitles is disappointing too. Perhaps future releases will have better PQ and caps or subs, in which case they will be worthy of a five star rating.",1387497600,5,295,4.285714285714286
2522070,5,B000ELIZZM,"WINGS was a popular and well-regarded comedy that ran for eight seasons on NBC from 1990-97, WINGS was created by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee, the team that worked together on CHEERS and later created FRASIER.

Tim Daly and Steven Weber play two brothers(Joe and Brian Hackett) respectively, who parted ways many years ago when a woman left Joe to marry Brian. Joe, the straitlaced do-everything-right brother, is running Sandpiper Air, a small airline on the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts that runs commuter flights to the New England coast, when he reluctantly offers a job to Brian, the carefree brother who's also a pilot.

Others who work at the airport are Helen Chapel(Crystal Bernard), the former girl-next-door who now works the lunch counter and aspires to be a professional cello player; Lowell Mather(Thomas Haden Church), the not-all-there mechanic; Roy Biggins(David Schramm), the owner of the rival airline AeroMass; and Fay, who handles Sandpiper's front desk. Over the short (six episodes) first season, Joe and Brian develop romantic triangles over both Helen and Brian's ex-wife Carol (Kim Johston Ulrich), and Brian tries to set up Joe with the island tramp (Megan Mullaly).

In the second season,(which was the 1990-91 Season) the romantic entanglements continue, Joe develops a health problem that keeps him from flying, and we meet the last major member of the cast, Italian cab driver Antonio Scarpacci (Tony Shalhoub). Guest stars include CHEERS' George Wendt and John Ratzenberger, Abraham Benrubi (ER) as Roy's son, and David Ogden Stiers as a conductor whom Helen tries to impress. While much of the regular cast faded from view after WINGS, Shalhoub and Church garnered critical acclaim for their work on MONK and SIDEWAYS, respectively.

Brothers Brian and Joe Hackett (Steven Weber and Timothy Daly) attempt to run a Nantucket-based airline while surrounded by their various wacky friends and employees. Series featured an outstanding supporting cast, including Crystal Bernard who previously co-starred on the sitcom IT'S A LIVING.",1387497600,,2081,5.3547400611620795
2522071,5,B000ELIZZM,love this show. i wish they brought it back. Oh well. i really enjoy watching this show its funny. yup.,1386028800,,103,4.2
2522072,5,B000ELIZZM,"I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them.
 Wings was one of the best of them.
 To get an idea what a terrific situation comedy Wings was, consider this: The last two names on the shows credit list of eight stars during its final three (of seven) seasons were Tony Shalhoub (who late starred in Monk) and the very clever and attractive Amy Yasbeck.
 The show was first-class all the way, from the opening musical piece by classical composer Franz Schubert to the final scene.
 Unlike many sitcoms, which have hardly any story lines at all, the plots of Wings always were strong, but the characters carried the show. Brothers Joe and Brian Hackett (Tim Daly, Steven Weber), Helen Chapel Hackett (Crystal Bernard), Lowell Mather (Thomas Haden Church), Roy Biggins (David Schramm) and Fay Cochran (Rebecca Schull), Shalhoub and Yasbeck all delivered hilarious lines.
 Wings, unlike many recent sitcoms, did not resort to X-rated jokes to evoke laughs (Well, maybe there were a few Rs). This was, in my opinion, the greatest sitcom of all-time. After Wings, airports have never seemed the same.
Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10. Jackie Gleasons Honeymooners.",1384905600,2,1679,4.87719298245614

2522074,4,B000ELIZZM,"The DVD set was priced right, and arrived quickly.  The quality on DVD is good, just remember that WINGS was originally shot in 4:3 format, so you will experience the black bars on your sides of the 16:9 TV you own.",1377993600,,215,4.2439024390243905
2522075,5,B000ELIZZM,"I have all 8 seasons of Wings, we're in the process of rewatching them now, my daughter checked on netflix and tried that out and surprise surprise, the video quality is superior to what the dvd transfers could think of being!!!
Arggghhh, so for the show I gave it 5 stars, so as not to tarnish the show, but would give it less than one star for the video quality, it's down right insulting to send out this and not only that, but charge us for it too?
The netflix was an eye opener, it tells me that there is a better transfer out there, they just did not bother to use that on the dvd release :-( poor, very poor showing there, pun intended!

2522088,5,B000ELIZZM,this is one of the funniest of sitcoms of the past 20 years. The first two seasons did not have tony Shaloub in them except for one episode. The show is funny and well done right from the start though. Tony shows up in one episode here and becomes a regular cast member in the third season. Most tv critics put this one pretty high up there as far as sitcoms go and for good reason. the shows are fast paced and have well defined characters that you care about. Evne the loathsome Roy biggens character is not two dimensional. The dvd set isn't the best mastering wise. They could have made this look better but it's not terrible at all. So if you want a great modern classic comedy series then this is worth your coin.,1344556800,,719,4.255474452554744

2522092,5,B000ELIZZM,"I'm a tail-end Baby Boomer-meaning that I was born between 1954, and 1964. My segment of the Boomers, were always over-shadowed in the media, by both our older Boomer brethren, and Gen-Xers. So, it was great to finally find a sitcom like ""Wings"", with tail-end Boomers as the main focus of the show. I could identify with these guys, since we hailed from the same generational zeitgeist, so-to-speak.

The series revolved around two very different brothers, named Joe and Brian Hackett. Joe was the elder, responsible, and straight-arrow one. Brian was his younger, much more free-spirited sibling (Brian could be a real screw-up, but somehow always came out okay in the end). Because of their radically different approach to life, their conflicts were the main source of laughs for the show.

The Hackett brothers ran a tiny, one-plane commuter airline, on the island of Nantucket. They were surrounded by a menagerie of other colorful characters on the show. Their lifelong friend, Helen, ran the lunch-counter at their little airline. Roy Bigguns was their ever-egocentric competitor. Roy always loved to crow that his airline, Aeromass, was bigger and better than the Hacketts' puny operation. Lowell was their ding-bat mechanic. And Faye was their receptionist/flight announcer, who was always hilariously cheerful.

In later seasons of the show, Lowell left. Then Antonio, the sad-sack airport cabdriver, joined the cast. The Antonio character was only mildly funny to me. I thought Lowell was much funnier. On occasion, actress Farrah Fork appeared on the show, as Brian's no-nonsense, military pilot girlfriend, Alex. She could never tame Brian's free-spirited ways, no matter how hard she tried (and it was always fun to watch her keep trying). Helen's klutzy sister, Casey, became a regular cast member late in the series. These extra characters added their own comedic dash to the overall ensemble of the show.

""Wings"" was never one of NBC's main comedy attractions, like ""Seinfeld"", or ""Cheers"" were. But for 10 seasons, it managed to generate a loyal viewer-ship. In my opinion, I think this was due to the fact that many viewers (myself included), liked to watch the Hackett brothers live-out their dreams. After all, they owned their own business, doing what they loved (flying). They had comfortable, solidly middle-class life-styles, even owning their own gorgeous house. They lived on a scenic island, far from any crime-ridden, major urban areas. All-in-all, the Hackett brothers were tail-end Boomers, who also managed to win the proverbial game-of-life. Many of us other tail-end Boomers could be inspired in our own lives, by watching the Hacketts every week on TV!",1262044800,4,2688,5.229698375870069
2522093,2,B000ELIZZM,"I love Wings the show, but Wings the DVD is horrible! As other reviewers have stated, the picture quality equals that of a home-made VHS tape. What's a VHS tape?... I'm waiting for it to come out on Blu-Ray, so should you.

2522095,3,B000ELIZZM,"If I can think of the TV shows that I usually watched during the 90's, Wings easily comes to my mind, and I remember every episode well although that fact was reinforced by having seen the reruns on USA channel. To this day, I am very astounded to learn that the very first episode aired nineteen years ago. Has time moved so fast? What I liked the best about Wings is its soft comedy with low expectations as this proved to be true in the first two seasons of Wings. Right now, I am looking at DVD cover of the show and questioning why the heck Tony Shalhoub, who only appeared in one episode titled ""Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places,"" is on it when it should have been Rebecca Schull and David Schramm. The first two seasons of Wings doesn't have laugh-a-minute episodes, and there has been too much needless drama blended in. From time to time, Wings can be corny. Although I like the characters just fine, I've always hated Helen Chapel (not Chappel as shown in back of the DVD cover) and disliked Lowell Mather. I just can't stand that stupid self-conceited arrogant personality shown off by Helen, and whenever Lowell's time to say his lines, Thomas Haden Church has this quality of delivering the lines and then waiting for the audience to laugh (if they were) before he resumes. Almost all the time, he is just not a funny guy, and I wasn't all that surprised that his career tanked when he left for a short unimpressive movie career and a failed sitcom. Timothy Daly has this overt awkwardness on his face that barely blended in well through television but would have obviously failed to translate though silver screens. Having said that, it was a miracle that he survived yet I enjoyed his character nevertheless. Rebecca Schull isn't so bad herself and makes a pleasant presence on the show. The most underrated actor of Wings goes to David Schramm who portrayed his chauvinistic character perfectly well and displayed a fine talent for comedy in a dry way. The look of his face reminds me of Oliver Hardy of the Laurel and Hardy comedy team. Now for the final member of the cast, Stephen Weber, who plays Brian Hackett, in my opinion, is the reason why Wings survived out of the hole that spelled doom for any starter shows. He is so funny and spontaneous that he actually interjects a lot of energy which helped to set off a huge momentum in many of the episodes. Whenever an episode wasn't working, Wings desperately needed Brian. It is like the Kramer effect that many shows are dependent on. If it wasn't for Brian, I can't see Wings working out at all. The best episodes of Wings seasons 1 and 2 have to be ""The Puppetmaster"" and ""My Brother's Back-And There's Going to be Trouble"" with ""Love Means Never Having to Say Geronimo"" a close behind. The reasons why the three worked the best is because of Steven Weber, and there is no denying it. Many of the other episodes are more or less good and sometimes flat. There are certain few episodes that I felt to be highly insensitive and plain inappropriate for airing such as ""There's Always Room for Cello,"" ""Sports and Leisure,"" ""A Stand Up Kind of Guy,"" ""Mother Wore Stripes,"" and maybe ""All in the Family."" The ""Mother Wore Stripes"" should have not been aired at all due to its manipulative dealing with a touchy issue and its sugarcoated ending. All in all, the first two seasons Wings show promises of good solid comedy, but the identification of its genre is often too blurred, and its comedy is uneven in many episodes although it rehashes some of the old formulas used in other shows or movies. If somebody said that Wings is genius, that's a large exaggeration. It's just a good show that happens to stand the test of time well. As for the technical aspect of the DVD, there are no special features or any subtitles except for English closed captions. The picture quality is exactly of that period of time which doesn't bother me, but if it was highly reformatted, it would have been embarrassing for me to see Joe's face.",1233360000,,4004,4.5625
2522096,5,B000ELIZZM,Loved the series and the subplots it had in each episode.  The epidode 'Plane 9 From Nantucket' was precious.

2522103,4,B000ELIZZM,"I prefer comedy to drama which is why I prefer purchasing the sitcoms like ""Wings"" that aren't aired in syndication on local stations. It grew on me and I love the characters. I love the sibling rivalry between the Hackett brothers played by Steven Weber and Tim Daly. They're fantastic and believable as brothers that they could be in real life.

Oscar nominee Thomas Haden Church as the dimwitted Lowell Mathers. There is Crystal Bernard who plays Helen Chapel, the woman who was an overweight child and now runs the lunch counter at the airport, of course I can't forget Roy Biggins played by the underappreciated David Schramm, and I love Fay Evelyn Cochran played by the divine and wonderful Rebecca Schull. The Hackett brothers' childhood wasn't functional since their father went crazy and their mother bailed out on them as kids.

Of course, they have their moments but the chemistry among the cast is what holds the show together. They genuinely care for each other onscreen and offscreen even with spoiler Roy Biggins who we get to know as a boy who suffered humiliation in his youth and grew up to be a tough owner of Aeromass airlines, the rival to the Hackett brother's airline, Sandpiper, which is just one airplane. The show also tackles issues like homosexuality when Roy's son played by Abraham Benrubi who was on ""ER"" and is now on ""Men in Trees"" comes out to his disappointment.

The show was never an Emmy winner although it did get nominations nor was it a critical hit but it was a beloved show because for thirty minutes, you just wanted to be in Nantucket and I still want to be in Nantucket if given the opportunity. I just wished that the DVD showed special features about this show.",1189296000,3,1709,4.67109634551495

2522119,5,B000ELIZZM,"I remember watching this show in the 90's. It is really the only sit-com that I can think of that I really truly enjoyed enough to watch every week.

Then, with syndication in the mid to late 90's I got to watch it all over again.

Well, now they have finally come to their senses and have started releasing the show on DVD. All I can say is it's about time. This was the funniest show of the 90's and it is my personal favorite sit-com of all time.

It just doesn't get any better. The characters are great; Joe, the anal and overly sensitive older brother; Brian, the flyboy (literally and figuratively); Helen, the quick-witted, smart-mouthed, lifelong friend; Fay, the (somewhat disfunctional) mother figure to everyone; Roy, the competition, a pain in the butt, but still always around causing trouble; and my personal favorites, Lowell and Antonio, Lowell being the village idiot that's good with a wrench but bad with everything else, and Antonio, who appears only once in the first 2 seasons but comes back in season 3 as the Italian cabby with a heart of gold but a long-fuse and a sarcastic, cynical outlook.

I LOVE THIS SHOW. To the producers, thank you, thank you, thank you!!!",1178755200,4,1190,4.652380952380953

2522121,5,B000ELIZZM,"You've got to watch and listen closely so you don't miss any of the puns! The combination of physical slapstick between Crystal Bernard (Helen) and Tim Daly (Joe) and impeccable comedic timing of Rebecca Schull (Fay) is only further enhanced by the deadpan straight man routine of Thomas Haden Church (Lowell). I highly recommend the ""Murder She Roast"" episode from Season 1, disc 4. It's full of the kind of humor that marks Wings as one of the best comedies of its time; and (dare I say) of all time?

The easy and welcome addition of Tony Shaloub (Antonio)in Season 3 kicks into high gear in ""Marriage, Italian Style"" and ""Divorce, American Style"" (episodes 1 and 2 on disc 3).  In fact, disc 3 of Season 3 is one of my favorites.  In ""Stew in a Stew"" we are given a peek into the childhood of Joe and Brian; which proves to be both bittersweet and humorous (a feat not successfully attained in most current sitcoms).

I will continue to enjoy these episodes again and again.  It's great entertainment and some of the best comedy ever written for network sitcoms.  Enjoy!",1174694400,3,1074,4.596858638743456

But it boggles my mind that they decided to put Tony Shaloub on the cover. Maybe he is introduced later but in this DVD, in season one and two, he makes one appearance in one show, as a waiter. He's terrific, but putting him on the cover was distracting - I kept waiting for his character to be introduced and come work at the airport or something and then...the season was over! This review should serve as a warning to other Shaloub fans - he only appears in one show on this DVD. That said, its a great DVD and I am glad I bought it.",1165968000,3,812,4.1069182389937104

Alas, I will have to award it only 3 stars and state outright that I will be watching any remaing episodes on cable TV.  I will not pay any amount of money, no matter how small, for DVD's whose picture quality is no better than a video tape running at LP speed.  I have many TV shows on DVD, and none is as poor as these are.  The sound is clean, crisp, and clear.  Why not the picture?  I'm not an expert in the technical aspects of a DVD, but could it be because of the number of episodes squeezed on one side of each disc?  There is something to be said for double sided discs if price is a concern.  I have a number of double sided TV shows and movies as well (Abbott and Costello series of films, for example)and I have no cmplaints.  ALL are of better quality than these.

The first episode I ever saw was the original airing of ""Murder She Roast"", and I still love that episode to this day.  While staying at Fay's house, Brian was watching an episode of ""Fugitives From Justice"" talking about one Florence Chambers, aka ""The Culinary Killer.""  Just as he was taking a big sip of the cocoa that Fay had prepared for him, Brian saw a computer aged photograph of the fugitive on-screen that looked just like Fay.  He froze, and at that moment Fay poked her head in the kitchen to ask Brian if he wanted some more cocoa.  He shook his head ""No"", Fay left the room and Brian then spewed the mouthful of cocoa he had been holding all over the table.  Nick at Nite was even running a commercial awhile back of great moments that featured this clip.  It was great!  That is just one great episode from the 28 that are included in this set.

Did you ever notice that if a show is unwatchable trash, it's out on DVD in like 6 months, but quality shows like WINGS take forever? Owning this classic sitcom on DVD was worth the wait; I just hope they don't pull the same stunt that Universal has with NIGHT GALLERY by releasing (in that case) the first season and then sitting on the rest.  If they do, we'll just have to send Lowell, Fay and Carlton Blanchard (""Hey Angelo...if a monkey were to bite ya, what kind of drugs would they make you take?"")  to have a little chat with them!

This DVD set contains the first 28 episodes in their original broadcast order.  The package design is attractive, the sound quality is good, but the video quality could be better.

I am disappointed also, but not about video quality (I didn't notice bad video quality).  I am disappointed that Season 3 is not available yet!  Hurry up and release the rest of seasons, please...I just think the characters are so lovable, I love this show!",1149724800,3,426,4.565789473684211
2522188,5,B000ELIZZM,"This show was aired for 8 seasons and I watched it before it was re-runs. It was and still is difficult to even do a search on the internet for this show and info on the cast. It was well written, funny, and just as good as Friends as far as an ensemble cast. Each character is unique. It never made magazine covers like a lot of other shows which was a shame. I have loved staying up late and watching the DVD. The quality is fine for me but was disappointed that there wasn't a special features section for behind-the-scenes. They never got the credit they deserved for this comedy. My teenagers love the show as well. I know David Angell, one of the shows creators, was on one of the planes that crashed into the WTC on September 11, 2001 and I wondered if that was what was making it take so long to come out on DVD but he also created Cheers and Frasier and they have been out a long time. I am just happy that Wings is finally out and cannot wait for the next few seasons to come out. It has sold out where we live in just about every store that carried it. I think it was a lot more popular than most thought. Thanks to the Angell family for allowing it to be released.",1149552000,5,1176,4.073275862068965
2522189,5,B000ELIZZM,I had forgotten how good a show this was. Good clean humor (not that I mind the dirty kind) that I can watch and enjoy with my family.,1149292800,4,134,3.8214285714285716
2522190,5,B000ELIZZM,"Wings was always a breath of fresh air with great supporting characters and plot lines that were plain and simple and ,best of all, funny.

Stuck in West Virginia overnight and depressed from a car breaking down while I was on ""vacation"", turning the television on in my motel room and finding an episode on took my troubles away for a brief time and I will never forget that...I was a fan before my accident, but realized how much of a fan I was that lonely night in Charleston WV

I highly reccomend this to all....and hope that I don't have to wait for the next set of episodes to be released too long from now.

Happy viewing to all

2522191,5,B000ELIZZM,"i am so glad that this show finally came out on DVD.  i'm only 20, but i've been watching reruns just about my whole life.  something about it is just so amazingly charming.  i don't even know what it is.  perhaps it's just that i was raised with the characters that i enjoy it so much.  whatever it is, i'm happy.  i LOVE every character.

the quality may be a bit bad, but for me, personally, i don't really care.  it's nothing bad enough for me to even notice.

only problem i had was that there were NO special features.  none.  just the show.  but even without features it's still Wings and it's still great.

hopefully there'll be some in future season releases.  YA HEAR ME, CBS?  RELEASE MORE SEASONS.  all of them and I WILL BUY.

one thing i noticed is that Tony Shalhoub who played Antonio Scarpacci is on the cover though he only becomes a regular in the third season.  he's just in one episode in Season Two as an Italian waiter.  it was a hilarious character, though, and i'll bet that his performance is what brought him back as a regular.  and i'm guessing they put him on the cover because he's more recognizable to the public.

oh, god, thank you for Wings.",1149120000,6,1175,4.32258064516129
2522192,5,B000ELIZZM,"It was worth waiting to once again get to watch Joe, Brian, Helen, and the others on Nantucket.  Several reviewers have commented on the quality of their DVD images, but I have no complaints in that area, as mine is quite clear. The show is still as funny as it was to me when I first watched it.  Now if the rest of the seasons would be released without making us wait for another eight or nine years we'd all be happy.",1149033600,6,420,4.109756097560975
2522193,5,B000ELIZZM,"Shame on the studios for putting out all the current garbage of reality shows on DVD and making us wait agonizing years to buy this show.  One reviewer said that he just didn't ""GET THE SERIES"". Obviously, he was a moron who can't judge quality. He'll do just fine watching Survivor and American Idol and the current trend of garbage that's flooding TV these days.

The Golden Girls DVD's were also of Poor Video Quality, so obviously NBC needs to be flogged for this insult. Two of the best series in the history of TV with such terrible video quality and such a long wait for their release.

I bought this the first day out and have been revelling in it since.  It's such a heart-warming show that so many people can relate to because of the similarities of their lives compared to the characters.  Shows don't get much better than this.

It seems really incredible that the show first aired in 1990!!! 16 years ago!!! WOW.....Who's old now?  I hope we don't have to wait as long for the next season to be released.

2522194,1,B000ELIZZM,"While there are many detractors who don't get the essence of the show, for those who can look beyond the minor flaws in the content, this is ONE GREAT SERIES! If only they had done a decent job in transfer to DVD. Even though I already have the entire series on DVD (minus ""A Terminal Christmas"" and the ""Black Eye Affair"") which I had saved when it ran on Nick-At-Night, I want to buy a super resolution version from the commerical outlets. Trouble is, if this first set is any indication, this ain't it! The quality is very poor, my DVD versions, which I first saved ""late at night"" on my satellite-DVR, and then re-dupped later to my DVDR (eliminating the commercials) are still vastly superior to the quality of these disks. The only redeeming value of these disks is that ""A Terminal Christmas"", which for some reason never ran on Nick-At-Night, was included, so I have been able to obtain one of the two epsisodes I am missing. Since I still need ""Black-Eye Affair"" (also didn't run on Nick-At-Night), I will probably buy the set that contains that episode when it comes out. But unless the quality VASTLY improves (we know good copies exist, my third generation copies from Nick-At-Night are better than these commercial versions) I will not waste my money on the series. Clean it up and I'll gladly buy it, even a re-issue copy of series 1 and 2, if the quality is improved!",1148947200,27,1382,4.576612903225806
2522195,4,B000ELIZZM,"A great comedy series like WINGS deserves a better release than this.

The Video Quality is blurry, washed out and very fuzzy.

Unlike HOGANS HEROES and other CBS/Paramount TV series that have finally been released on DVD lately with EXCELLENT video quality... it appears they used some low quality prints or even VHS copies of old shows to make the DVD transfers here on WINGS.

I give the series 10 stars !!! but the poor DVD transfer lowers the rating to a 4 since they are hard to watch with this substandard release.",1148774400,43,521,4.580645161290323
2522206,3,B000ELIZZM,I remember a couple of years back I emailed nbc and asked them when wings would be out on dvd and I got some really lame answer about market trends and whatever.  Now cbs video releases this and to do such a horrible job with it. I saw a knockoff dvd of a few episodes that had better image quality. Its like cbs copies them on a home computer from a vcr or something.  Very Very disappointed,1148774400,12,392,4.077922077922078
2522207,2,B000ELIZZM,"Next to Friends, this is my favorite TV show and I was so excited to get it on DVD.  The picture quality is poor--almost blurry.  I also have TV shows from the 50's on DVD and the quality is crisp, sharp, great contrast - why couldn't CBS do that for this wonderful show?  Very disappointing.",1148688000,25,292,4.2727272727272725
2522208,5,B000ELIZZM,"I have personnally waited for this to come out for years now. I do not understand why it has not come out before now. Newer shows have already come out way ahead of this and most of them are not as good a quality as this is. Yes, the video quality is lacking a little, just a little, but it is well worth the $30 price tag. I hope everyone thinks the way I do about this series, because I have watched it since almost from the series beginning.",1148515200,6,444,4.0

2522210,4,B000ELIZZM,Its a real shame and disappointment that Ive waited this long for my favorite TV series on DVD to see how bad the video quality is.

Went out and picked it up today, popped it in my DVD, fired up the plasma and yikes an old VHS tape looks better than this. Nothing was done to clean this up for the DVD and by todays standards this is almost unwatchable. Universal did a much better job on the DVD transfer of the almost decade older Magnum PI series.

2522212,5,B000ELIZZM,"Created by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee, all producers of the critically acclaimed Cheers and writers for its hit spin-off Frasier, Wings shares many of the same attributes of the popular bar ""where everybody knows your name"". Just as each episode of Cheers mostly took place in the Beacon Street pub, each episode of Wings takes place in Nantucket airport. Cheers maintains a friendly rivalry with Gary's Old Towne Tavern, while Sandpiper Air has a friendly rivalry with Aeromass owner Roy Biggins. And just like Cheers, the strength of Wings is built upon great writing and eccentric, well-developed characters. From the moment you hear the memorable and soothing Schubert theme song, you'll want to be transported away to this quiet island of lovable and hilarious characters...

Wings centers around the lives of two brothers, Joe (Tim Daly) and Brian Hackett (Steven Weber), who run a fledgling airline on the northeast vacation island of Nantucket. The two are assisted by sarcastic stewardess Faye Cochran (Rebecca Schull) and oddball mechanic Lowell Mather (Thomas Haden Church). Responsible and dependable, Joe attempts to keep the struggling business afloat in the face of fierce competition from chief rival Aeromass and its seedy owner Roy Biggins (David Schramm). But compounding Joe's problems is the unreliability of his younger brother Brian who is more of a free spirit and spontaneous adventurer. The terminal lunch counter is owned by the Hackett's childhood friend Helen Chapel (Crystal Bernard), an aspiring cellist with a quick wit. Superbly written, Wings is at times nutty and absurd, but it's always funny and the characters will quickly earn a place in your heart. It's by far one of the best situation comedies of its era...

The Wings (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Legacy"" in which Joe Hackett, owner of a small single-plane airline known as Sandpiper Air receives a letter from his recently deceased father. The letter calls for him to open a package in the presence of his estranged brother Brian. After jumping through a number of hoops, the two brothers realize how important they are to one another, and Brian (a pilot himself) agrees to stay in Nantucket and help Joe run the airline... Other notable episodes from season one include ""All For One and Two for Helen"" in which Joe grows jealous of what he perceives to be a romantic relationship between Helen and Brian, and ""A Terminal Christmas"" in which the gang from the Nantucket airport unexpectedly drops into Fay's house for Christmas, only to find her grieving her dead husband and preparing to spread his ashes...

After seeing the constant flow of the ""almost popular/funny/good"" series show up on DVD at all the retailers, it was really baffling and annoying to never see ""Wings"" show up on the shelves.

""Wings"" is one of my favorites because to me it's what TV was meant for - ENTERTAINMENT! Although they would have a ""deep life lesson"" behind the various situations the characters would find themselves in, they would never let it get in the way of a good laugh.

So whoever is responsible for making this finally happen - Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!!! And also shame on you for not making it happen much sooner. Please don't make us wait so long for the subsequent seasons.",1146182400,4,802,4.412162162162162

2522237,5,B000ELIZZM,"'Wings' is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time, if not the greatest.  Very few shows offer as many constant laughs and endearing, heart warming stories with characters that became comedy legends.  Who can forget Joe Hackett, the patriarch of the airport family, or his brother Brian, the casanova ladies' man who always had problems in the game of love.  Then there's Helen Chappel, future wife of Joe and proprietor of the airport's snackbar, who was always pulling out hairs due to the crazy antics of her co-workers.  Then there's Roy Biggins, the sleazy, slick yet somehow still lovable manager who's constantly scheming new ways to make a buck.  Sort of like Roy's arch-nemesis, Fay Cochran is like everyone's grandmother: sweet, caring, funny with a bit of a mischevious side.  Next is Lowell Mather, the bumbling, goofy but always well-intentioned plane mechanic who consistently brought golden comedy moments.  A character that was introduced later on but who became an invaluable addition to the cast was Antonio Scarpacci, played by Tony Shalhoub who has gone on to further fame with his TV hit series entitled 'Monk'.  Antonio's subtle, slightly neurotic portrayal of an insecure immigrant brought a great deal of humor as well as heart to the show, a character who nearly everyone could empathize with.  Finally, a character who didn't enter 'Wings' until a few seasons later but added a tremendous amount to the show's comedy was Casey Davenport, actress Amy Yasbeck and widow of the late great John ritter.  She played the on again off again girlfriend of Brian Hackett, and together they shared many hilarious episodes as they failed at dating.

Truly a classic sitcom, one that I personally love and never tire of, so I cannot wait to finally get my hands on this wonderful DVD collection after waiting all these years.  Here is a brief rundown of all episodes from the first two excellent seasons:

Season 1

1.  'Legacy'- Joe and Brian Hackett reunite after a 6-year separation due to Brian stealing Joe's fiance' and end up making amends, which was their late father's dying wish.

Meanwhile, Brian attemps to cheer up Fay by letting her beat him in a game of tennis.  Unfortunately for Brian, word gets around of his loss and everyone gives him a hard time.  Helen confronts Roy over sex discrimination in the hiring process.

21. 'My Brother's Back- And There's Going To Be Trouble'- Joe's back is injured which forces him to stay at the hospital, so Brian takes over management of the airport.  Brian has lots of creative ideas on how to improve business but they are less than successful.

The first two seasons do not have Antonio Scarpacci, unfortunately, but we can all look forward to him in the third season at which point he becomes a regular.  This is such a wonderful show and I'm glad that all its fans finally get to enjoy it on DVD!",1142553600,161,8047,4.56415620641562
2522238,5,B000ELIZZM,Wings is by far the best tv sitcom ever made.  I am so happy it's finally being released on DVD.  I used to stay up until 3:00 am just to watch it. I just hope the rest of the seasons are released in short order!  I can't stop laughing when I watch it.  This is the best tv show ever!,1142553600,4,284,3.683333333333333
2522239,5,B000ELIZZM,"My wife and I absolutely loved Wings. We watched it EVERY single day when it was on the USA network. Usually all four episodes. It was our daily ritual. Now we hardly watch tv because for the most part its all crap! Why a show like Roseanne is still heavily syndicated and has been released on DVD before Wings is beyond my comprehension. I almost shed a tear of joy when I found out Wings was finally being released!

Wings, Scrubs and News Radio, in that order! :)",1142553600,6,466,4.295454545454546
2522240,5,B000ELIZZM,"funny how you don't realize how much TV has changed, and how much what we're increasingly fed by the media moguls has deteriorated.  i've always been a huge fan of 'wings' and am thrilled it's finally being released on DVD (now i can jettison the 30-odd VHS tapes i've carried with me through 5 moves!).  What a lovely, truly funny, memorable, heart-warming, clever, exceptional show this was...and for all of you too young to have enjoyed it -- especially if you think crap like 'joey' and 'two guys and a girl' and anything on the WB is good TV -- please give it a try.  you'll see why the folks you consider 'ancient' shake our heads at what passes for entertainment today.  Kudos to the entire staff and cast, for letting me feel this way about a TV show!",1141776000,16,759,4.438848920863309

I don't know what took so long, but I'm thrilled that it's finally going to happen.  I can't wait.  Wings is one of my all time favorite shows.  The characters are terrific; people that you can love and care about.  Here's to releasing all the seasons!",1141171200,18,347,4.196969696969697

2522244,5,B000ELIZZM,"Finally, they're coming out with the ""Wings"" DVDs-I've been searching for these dvds forever-I have them on vhs tape off the tv, but they're really shabby. I was getting so disgusted with some of the dvds already out such as ""Hogan's Heroes"" etc. Even ""Ned and Stacy"" have already come out on dvd- I love Thomas Haden Church, but come on...I have preordered the DVD-I hope many more fans do the same thing. I also hope that it won't take them so long to put out the remaining seasons. I love ""Wings""! I also loved Tim Daly's ""Eyes"", but that's another story...",1140912000,10,560,4.5
2522245,5,B000ELIZZM,"I have got to pinch myself to see if i am just having a dream.  I honestly thought they'd never release wings on DVD.  This is one of my all time favorite comedies next to frasier, and it is great that so many fans of this show are finally getting it on DVD.  I plan to order my copy very soon, can't wait to get ahold of this one.",1140739200,11,331,3.7681159420289854
8110914,5,B000ELIZZM,"I liked to watch this show when it was on Netflix, but it hasn't been on Netflix for a few years now and I had wanted to re-watch a couple of the more memorable episodes, but at the same time I didn't want to spend around $30 for the complete series set at the time, so I just bought this season 1 and 2 DVD set, and also the season 3 and 4 DVD set for about $6 each.
The first season isn't very good, and with only six mediocre episodes I have no idea how it got renewed for a real second season that is much better, but it does indeed get a lot better in the second season.  This show is definitely unique among sitcoms, and it had some truly great episodes.
The quality of these DVDs is pretty decent.  The episodes look about the same as they did on Netflix, it's not the greatest quality, but I think that's about as good as this series would ever look without some serious work done on it that no company would probably ever bother with.  The audio is very good as well, definitely clear, probably the best technical aspect of these budget DVDs.
Overall if you liked Wings and want to watch some of it again I do recommend these budget DVDs if you want a cheap way to watch the show.  Also I did end up buying the complete series set eventually, I forgot how great the later seasons are and they were only available with the complete series set.",1526860800,,1351,4.145038167938932
8110915,5,B000ELIZZM,"Great price.
Season one started slow and began to warm in season two.
The series takes its wings during seasons 3 and 4 where a waiter becomes a lovable taxi-driver..
There's a complete collection as well.
I'm buying these, individual and double seasons, as collector' items.",1521763200,,275,5.0

8110917,2,B000ELIZZM,"I hate to give this DVD set just 2 stars, because we enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 of ""Wings"" quite much. Some episodes are great, while others are strange and needed polishing, but overall we like it. The characters work well together, and the best episodes are clever and well-written. However, the picture quality of these is abysmal, very low resolution. That's why I give this set 2 stars. I mean, I've bought lots of sitcoms on DVDs, but this looks worse than any of my others, even shows like ""Bewitched,"" ""The Munsters,"" and ""Gomer Pyle USMC"" that were made about 30 years earlier than ""Wings""! Some reviewers say all DVDs from Mill Creek look bad, but most DVDs I've bought from that company look OK. However, something sure went wrong this time! For season 3 of ""Wings"" I'm going to try the DVD set from Paramount to see if those look better.",1516752000,,846,4.5359477124183005
