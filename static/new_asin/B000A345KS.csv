I really needed to see and hear all of the motivational ideas and suggestions in the film. It was just a complete pleasure to witness. A truly AMAZING experience!

This film is truly refreshing!!! It stands alone. It encourages you to dream as BIG as you want to...and even when you've reached there...it encourages you to reach higher and dream BIGGER!! This film changed my life...it sounds somewhat cliche'...but it's true. Its completely changed the way I THINK. Most people don't know that, but the way you think confirms your success. I really don't know what else to say except for to order it and see for yourself!!! An experience you will never forget!",1128384000,8,813,4.725352112676056

2355236,2,B000A345KS,"Chopped up interviews from a bunch of entertainment industry people on how to be successful. All you need to do is be positive and work hard and stick to it blah blah blah. Nobody dreamed of being a janitor, but we need janitors as a society. A world without janitors is no more desirable than a world without guitar masters no matter how much I love Santana. Are we to think that people who do real work just didn't listen to their inner self, they didn't risk enough. Life isn't that simple. Some people make sacrifices for those they love or don't have the mobility, either financially or socially to reach their potential. I think that no matter what happens, no matter how hard everyone tries to be a ballerina, or whatever, there will still be janitors, so why should those people deserve any less respect? People in ""desirable"" positions can either thank those who put them in the position to attain that goal and give themselves kudos for their input, or delude themselves with the idea that they earned all they have in life. So few of us are truly self made, just ask George W. If there is one takeaway, its if you have a shot at fulfilling your dream, take it, because it seemed to work for these scmucks. The other takeaway if your not a rotten person is that everyone deserves respect, and that ""successful"" people don't have the keys, sometimes they work hard and sometimes they just get lucky, or both. I stopped watching about half way through, so if this review missed something that is why. I just needed to comment on the smarmy undercurrent without sitting through the rest of the program.",1451779200,5,1609,4.570934256055363

2355238,2,B000A345KS,"""It's better to be lucky than good,"" voiced the baseball world series pitcher Lefty Gomez, who wore five world series championship rings, all won while he pitched for the powerhouses of the 1930s: the New York Yankees.

The 57-minute documentary ""The 5 Keys to Mastery"" emphasizes more on personality, characteristic traits rather than simple luck. When a TV journalist recalled the time when she just turned 20 years old, and she dated a successful 30-year-old man, who took her to a party as arm candy for her attractiveness she found herself in the middle of a group of educated, successful men, who were chatting about oil cartels. She said she refrained from talking, even though she believed she knew the subject inside out, because she was so young. Right then and there, I hit the pause button. So young, she thought she was an expert on oil cartels, sounds unbelievable. Unless someone's in their 50s, it's tough to be an expert on such weighty topics. Yet this documentary leads the viewers to believe she was an expert.

This documentary only proved the huge distance between facts and opinions.  Nonetheless, as a documentary, it was set up properly. The gist of this video is the five key steps to success: #1 Follow your passions, #2 Practice, #3 Get a mentor, #4 Visualize desired outcome, and #5 play the edge, self-transcend. Sensible advice, especially finding a mentor.

Even following your dreams make sense. Yet my bit of good advice,: it's all about being in the right place, right time, with the right skills. And more important: solid connections in your field of endeavor. It's a lot easier to reach the top in Hollywood if one of your parents is already there.

In this documentary, there are some knowledgeable, talented, successful, and really smart people: real climbers to success. Two are well respected guitarists, Carlos Santana and B.B. King, and there's Hollywood actor Stephen Tobolowsky, who starred in the movie ""Groundhog Day."" Yet many got to the top simply by having the talent, the natural smarts, or the right connections, to succeed, not by following the golden rules this documentary offers.

For some, luck was enough. Luck was all that was needed: being in the right place, right time, with the right skills.

Despite this documentary's message, there are plenty of really smart and really talented folks out there who just failed to reach the top level, even middle level of success, as those interviewed for this documentary, all stars in their fields.

For example, while growing up, I knew a guitarist, who was a phenomenal guitar player, yet after 20 years of going nowhere fast, at 40-years-old, he just gave up his dream of being a rock-n-roller, and took a job in a supermarket.

If he had continued his pursuit, his passion, he might have finally been successful, yet that's a big, big maybe. Instead of touring the local clubs, and selling several thousand records, which ended up happening, he had quit his local club playing days to take a 9 to 5 job in real life to pay the bills..

What this documentary failed to mention is the competition in the real world. Very much like the competition to win the lottery. The reality of failure is called understanding pragmatism, It's a world full of wannabes; the boulevard of broken dreams is quite crowded with competitors who had bit the dust.

Yet this documentary is about the rare exception, who beat the odds and won in the game of life. My hat off to them, yet there are a lot more losers in life, who ended up simply as peas in the pods.

Outside of the taking longshot chances to be on the road to success,  I found other serious flaws with this documentary: one it completely skipped over the luck factor in life, and two it only interviewed those who succeeded in reaching the top.

It's like the winner of a multi-million dollar lottery being interviewed on TV, only the winner is interviewed and the millions and millions of losers are ignored. Such is life.

The opinions of The 5 Keys to Mastery all make sense. Yet life is a lot more tough, more complicated, than this documentary leads on. Sure all those interviewed for this documentary are successful, yet there are plenty more losers than they're winners. Nonetheless, interviewing losers is not good for documentaries, there are way too many who already know how that feels.",1444780800,6,4348,4.801874163319947
2355239,5,B000A345KS,"I really enjoyed this feature. The primary thing I noticed about it (aside from practice, practice, practice) was that it was a number of very successful people describing Their Individual tools for success.

2355303,4,B000A345KS,"Enjoyed this inspirational film on mastery and the 5 underlying keys: surrender to your passion, practice-practice-practice, get a guide-research your field, visualize the outcome positively and as if happening in the present, play the edge.

Diverse individuals were featured from diverse fields such as neuroscience, olympic athletes, an acting coach to Brad Pitt and Halle Berry among others, a famous guitar maker, musicians such as BB King and Santana, and Linus Torvald who invented the Linux computer software system.

Loved some of the other advice in here:

* be willing to be a fool

* take your pain and circumstances to fuel your passion

* never stop learning

* comfort is the enemy of the artist

* each of us is potentially a genius

* failure to develop our potential can cause disease, depression etc.

This film provokes thought on what it takes to have mastery in the field for which you have passion. While I particularly enjoyed several of the speakers (especially the actor) would have liked more content.  This film would be great in a classroom of high school or college students as a springboard for discussion on mastery.  It could be used also in positive psychology classes or life coaching classes.  It made me want to apply the principles, and is motivating.  4.5 stars for an introductory film on the subject.",1411776000,2,1341,4.933035714285714

2355306,4,B000A345KS,"It was interesting to watch and the ""masters"" that give advice have a lot of good things to say.  The main points are :

Discover what it is you want to master
Practice with the help of a teacher
Visualize what it is you want as if it is actually happening and you have actually achieved it, that it is yours NOW.

I feel it leaves out certain factors that prevent people from achieving master status, such as an impoverished childhood and few opportunities.  I am sure if you spoke to each of the Masters represented in the documentary they had other factors which played a role in their specific areas of expertise.  Usually parents who set up an environment conducive to growth and learning.",1403913600,,694,4.52

Very glad I watched this. To listen to an expert in their field (whom are people just like us,) offer reasons to just keep getting up and don't let naysayers steer you off course - or dead end.

I thought that the approach of interleaving what each personality had to say about each of the 5 themes kept the film lively and moving forward.  There was an interesting balance of both a male and female perspective, although the inclusion of additional female voices might have been edifying.

I go back to this video every so many weeks to go deeper on the journey that Dave sets us on.  I've recently started to build my weekly activities under the major themes of the ""5 Keys"":

1) Vision/focus (I list my intents for the week;  These usually feed into my larger life goals)
2) Surrendering to my passion (I declare my passion each week so that I am in sync with my actions and commitments)
3) Get a Guide (who is my mentor for these tasks?...sometimes we need more than one person...I usually only write this when I start something new)
4) Practice, Practice, Practice (these are the things that I need to ""play"" with... like writing correspondence, creating drafts, holding discussions etc -- this heading allows me to keep things light while recognizing I am still making progress toward my goal).
