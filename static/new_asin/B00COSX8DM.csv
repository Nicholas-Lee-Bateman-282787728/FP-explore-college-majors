5731550,5,B00COSX8DM,finally a whole season of goof trop it was the last in the line to get for home. its a shame that it hasn't have spanish subtiles at least. but the english closed caption its a very good way to learn english. I recomend to buy it for the black sense of humor and the exageration of the situations were pete and goofy get involved.,1402963200,,330,4.092307692307692

8584108,5,B00COSX8DM,"I get a real kick out of and cant help but like Goof Troop. Especially most of the episodes where none of the members of the Pete or Goof families are absent. And even more so most of the ones where Peg is not absent, since I find her overall to be funniest next to Pete.

What I find most easily hilarious about Peg is her peevishness along with the authoratatively shrill voice ranges not to mention tones she has. She is most hilarious whenever she gets this certain contrary tone when she is in one of her contrary moods or is ticked, and especially whenever she is dealing with Pete, and sometimes with her kids. Though she is the most hilarous of all whenever she in a shrill tone yells. For all of these reasons, I would even say that of all characters that have ever been voiced by April Winchell that I have seen and noticed that I would give Peg the most stars of all. Where I believe that April Winchell did the greatest in all her voice career so far having once done Peg.

Admittingly, unlike most Goofy fans, I actually watch them way more for Peg and Pete than I do Goofy. Even if they all together and in the right synergy make the episodes they're all in hilarious.

For all of the reason mentioned above, it has always shamed me very much that Peg and Pistol never had any appearances or even as much as any references to them by anyone in either A Goofy Movie or An Extremely Goofy Movie. If it would have been up to me at the times they were made, I certainly would have included them, since they were part of the Pete family in this whole series. In the whole time course, it is one thing to exclude Peg and Pistol and even the pets from any of the movies, but it is another thing to exclude characters that existed in the first movie like Roxanne and Stacy from it's sequel. Personally, I believe the Goofy movies would have been way greater than they were if Peg, Pistol, and the pets from this series, along with Roxanne and Stacy starting with the first movie all would have never been excluded and unmentioned from any of them.",1473465600,,2053,4.286082474226804

8584116,5,B00COSX8DM,I can always count on Disney to make very good cartoons. My children enjoy them almost as much as I do.,1403654400,,103,3.9523809523809526
8584117,5,B00COSX8DM,"Goof Troop is a great show.  I really enjoy getting to watch it whenever I want to now.  Goofy and Pete make the show though, and especially if Pete is absent from an episode I almost want to say the episode isn't worth watching.  Pete's character is amazing and to me he is the highlight of the show and all the humor either comes from him or revolves around him.  He's so good in part to his voice actor Jim Cummings who is an absolutely incredible voice actor(he shows up everywhere, if you don't know anything about him look him up and you'll be impressed). Seriously, if Pete isn't in an episode I almost cant stay interested. Goof Troop in my opinion is not as good as Gargoyles, Talespin, DuckTales, Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers, or Adventures of the Gummi Bears, but that being said I still love the show.  The main complaint I have is that the case the DVDs come makes you stack the DVDs on top of each other and that concerns me, but thats just Disney being cheap as usual(all they care about apparently is RAKING in LOADS of MONEY).  Theme song as with most every disney cartoon from the time is awesome.",1403136000,,1113,4.352657004830918
