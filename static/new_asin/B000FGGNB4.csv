8122382,5,B000FGGNB4,It gave the truth about what's really going on with the medical complex. Something you won't ever hear from doctors.,1473120000,,116,4.85
8122383,1,B000FGGNB4,"The people who are involved in the making of this film are all very clueless. Pharmaceutical Sales is about educating phycians to make a informed decision on what to write for there patients. Reps educate Dr's, Nurses office staff and Pharmacists on NEW medications that come to market. Most Dr's that do not see sales reps are so outdated in there practice they are a disgrace to there profession. I would not recomend this film.",1293494400,,430,4.746666666666667
8122384,5,B000FGGNB4,Anyone who cares about their health should see this DVD and give it to their family and friends. I'm an RN and Clinical Nurse Specialist and am appalled at how much control the drug companies have over us. Wake up America. Know what is REALLY going on when you visit a doctor or when you accept pharmaceutical marketing. The system has really become sickening and is all about money. The FDA is NOT there to protect you. The government is not there to protect you. Educate yourself and live.,1256947200,3,491,4.52808988764045
8122385,5,B000FGGNB4,Excellent dvd X 3.  Americans need to see this on tv rather than just a dvd.  So informative..and tragically Accurate.,1251590400,2,118,4.85
8122386,5,B000FGGNB4,"You cannot imagine what bravery it took for this DVD to be made. One guest is a former detail man and the producer is former detail woman, now called drug reps. In a PBS documentary style, but with rapid movement between 6 guests, this is the story of overselling drugs, mis-educating physicians, and control of even academic medical research. Even if you are a jaded cynic like me, you will find out some new disgusting angle to the prescription drug business.
  Here is the place for me to recommend Deadly Medicine by Thomas J. Moore (1995) and any of his other books. And Let Them Eat Prozac by David Healy (2004). And The Trouble with Medical Journals by Richard Smith. And Calculated Risks by Gerd Gigerenzer (2002).",1191628800,8,722,4.677165354330708
8122387,5,B000FGGNB4,"This is an excellent overview of how drug companies will stoop at nothing to show their products in a good light, even if their ""cures"" are worse than useless and exorbitantly expensive.

Two former sales reps explain how the drug companies seduce doctors from the time they're in med school with gifts, trips, etc.  Yes, we all know this, but hearing it from people who engaged in these practices makes their methods seem even more odious and manipulative.

I especially liked Dr. Hoffman from UCLA whose calm explanations of the business of medicine and modern drug company tactics were excellent and scathing.

I wish this DVD was required by all medical schools.",1161648000,18,666,4.919642857142857
8122388,5,B000FGGNB4,"This documentary is very concise, and very straight forward.  It does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir.  It features interviews with some very credible sources, all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic.  I really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together.  This documentary makes a great point and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics.",1147824000,19,469,4.825
8122389,4,B000FGGNB4,"I really enjoyed this documentary and it's lack of fluff.  I am warn down by my generation's new over-the-top approach to documentary filmmaking.  It is one thing to incorporate a barrage of pop music and rapid editing into a feature, or even a documentary about a band or a spelling bee, but what I really appreciated about this documentary was its refusal to mask the facts with entertaining rhetoric.  The film is very blunt and gets to the point.  It has something to say, and it says it - clearly.  If you are looking for 50 minutes of relevant information that will leave you feeling nothing short of enlightened, this is the documentary for you.",1146700800,17,652,4.6347826086956525
