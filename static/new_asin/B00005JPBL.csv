1557901,5,B00005JPBL,"How can a film be the least violent yet the most violent in a series at the same time? This movie once again from the start, takes us into the mind of Jigsaw as he lays on his death bed. His comrad Amanda is still there yet not as sane or calm as before) However, in his newest game there are not as many players, it really takes you back to the atmosphere of the first one. We first see Lynn, a doctor who has lost contact with her children and her husband, disconnected and lost from her own world. She is choosen to keep Jigsaw alive until his final game has finished (if not the results will be deadly). Then we have Jeff, a man who has lost his son, as he was killed by a drunk driver and seeks vengeance against all involved. That is his prison, that is his torment. As Jeff is  put to the test, we see he really isn't in any physical pain, in  fact it is much worse pain he must confront. All, the people involved, witness, judge, drunk driver are hidden in rooms and if jeff wishes to survive, he  must do the most painful thing of  all. Help them, keep them alive and worst of all, forgive them. This movie also features many flashback scenes from 1 and 2 and also, what happens in between these films. The saddest has to be with Adam (inbetween 1 and 2) and the one with Eric Matthews is great as well. This also features the most gruesome traps ever seen in the Saw franchise. This movie, shows growth in the series, not  only does it carry the important message and classic gore we want from Saw but it also was a very emotional movie this time around. 5/5 Not as good as the first but better than the second.",1161907200,21,1621,4.133333333333334
1557902,3,B00005JPBL,"I work at my movie theater so I saw this today at an emplyee screening.  Here is what I have to say,  Saw 3 brings us more of what we want.  More gruesome scenarios, more sick and twisted gore images, more characters reaching the peak of their insanity.  While those scenes will please hardcore fans of the series this movie does fall short from the first 2.  My only real issue of this movie was that was just too long.  The first 2 films were roughly 1 and 1/2 hrs.  This one is over 2 hours.  What was good about the length of the first 2 was that they were able to keep an intense atmosphere since they were not as long.  I suppose since this film was alot longer, it was hard to keep up the instense atmosphere and instead, the makers had much of movie be based on Amanda's (Shawnee Smith) character developement.  They are many memory sequences from the first and second, even footage that we have not seen.  Although it was intersting to see those, it was just too much.  It slowed down the intsensity of the film.  There are points where you just wanna get away from the memory sequence and flash foroward to the present timeline so you can on with the movie.  Other than being slow, I think this movie has more than it needs to please its audience.  Here is the plot.
Doctor Lynn Benlon (Bohar Soomekh) spends her days working at the hospital and then later coming home to what is soon to be a failed marraiage.  She is now one of the new subjects in Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) final game.  With the help of Amanda, Lynn is captured.  Apparently Jigsaw's cancer is just about to finish.  He is reaching the end of his life, but he wants to be alive to see what the outcome will be of his final game.  Jigsaw was once treated by Doctor Lynn, now he wants her to to keep him alive long enough to see the end of his game.  The Rules for her is that if Jigsaw dies, she dies.
Jigsaw latest game involves Jeff (Angus Macfayden) a man who lost his son to a drunk driver.  But what was worse is that the man was set free after 6 months.  He has been hell bent on revenge for yrs now and now he'll have the chance to do so.  His game involves a certain twist.  Instead of his life on the line, He will control the fate of other ppl's lives.  Other ppl who were involved with his son's case whom could have made a difference in the case's outcome.  Now their lives will be in his hands because they are put into fatal (and sickly brilliant) contraptions.  He is being tested to show if he will be willing to forgive them or stoup to a level lower than them.  Can Doctor Lynn be able to keep Jigsaw alive till Jeff completes his test??
All in all in definetly a fun way to spend the night.  More gore, more blood, more F@%#d up $h!+.  If you love the first, def check this one out.",1161820800,3,2775,4.159774436090226

1558444,4,B00005JPBL,"Oh Saw III, one of my ""favorites"" out of the SAW series. Maybe it's the twists and turns, or the Tobin Bell, i don't know...
I'm not going to go into much of the plot, as anything can give away the ending, however! it's still good.
The unrated version has plenty of extra gore, i think some of the most out of the franchise.
The theme of revenge in this, is quite lovely, i mean it shows that revenge can completely destroy you, psychologically and physically.
Pro's
Acting
Amanda (always Amanda, despite a few flaws, the character telling is fantastic)
Tobin Bell (i'm biased.)
Some of the traps are quite clever, some of the better ones out of the franchise
parts of the story
Decent traps, the Rack was creative
Con's
 They flashback to something that was revealed less than 3-9 minutes prior. (multiple times, ugh)
A really stupid trap/puzzle/thing, i'm still annoyed just thinking about it. They explain so many things, to an annoying degree, but that one scene just happened, no explanation. (comment on this and we can whine together)

All in all, i liked it, i didn't love it. It had some redeeming qualities which make it one of the better of the films.",1445990400,,1162,4.608695652173913

1558718,3,B00005JPBL,"I bought ""Rated Full Screen"" edition of ""Saw III"" to complete my extensive Blu-Ray and DVD collection of the ""Saw"" series, as I wanted to own all three cuts of the film available. (Between the theatrical, uncut and director's cut)  As a fan of horror films, somewhat a collector, and a pretty big fan of this franchise, I've spent the past few years attempting to buy every version of each film that was released on DVD and Blu-Ray.

To get it out of the way, I think the ""Saw"" series is vastly underrated, and people forget how good the first three films are, due to some underwhelming sequels that came after.  (Although I do think that ""Saw VI"" is on par with the original trilogy.)  In fact, ""Saw III"" is probably my favorite film in the franchise, as it goes to great lengths to develop the characters, fill-in motivations, and really humanize everyone.  It's not so much an intense horror as a very human drama hiding behind the guise of a hardcore horror film.

I will say I am somewhat disappointed with this particular release, however.  Because this is the only release to feature the original theatrical cut, and it's only available in the inferior full-screen format.  I don't quite understand the motivation for this.  By the time this film was released, widescreen was already beginning to take over, and full-screen was in the early stages of pretty much being phased out.  Heck, within about 18 months of this film's release, I could barely even find any TV's that were full-screen in any stores.  So why make full-screen the ONLY option to see the theatrical cut?

Still, I will give it 3 stars, because I'm sure that some people will not care as much as I did, and it is nice to be able to re-visit the film as I initially saw it in theaters eight years ago.",1411516800,,1776,4.550314465408805

1559065,2,B00005JPBL,"By 2006 the now-passe torture porn sub-genre was in full swing. The producers of Saw were enjoying the profits made from cheaply and easily grossing-out morbid audiences with icky gore and people screaming. It's not clever, and it's not even remotely classy.

Clocking in at just under two hours, this is the longest of the Saw series, but the constant flashbacks that bloat that running time are already becoming very tiresome and gives the movie the feel of a TV show. Chopping the heavy plot into vignettes is not very theatrical or interesting.

With Jigsaw still at large and Donnie Wahlberg's angry cop now missing the cops begin to suspect that Jiggy has an accomplice. This is all forgotten about by the five-minute mark as the movie then sidetracks into a story about a man who has lost his son in a car accident and wishes for retribution. Jiggy arranges for the retribution to happen, but advises him to save the people responsible from gruesome death instead of letting them die.

Jiggy's judgement and justification is already becoming dubious and morally suspect by this point. I half expect him to start kidnapping and setting-up people for watching too much Nickelodeon or flying too many kites. The morality should go both ways. If Jiggy is subjecting so many people to unbearable agony then he should have experience and knowledge of much, much more than simply dying of cancer and surviving a car crash. Who does he think he is? Ultimately, he's just as bad as the people he is judging.

The story is worthy of a higher score, but as usual it is bogged down by horrendous editing, cheap photography filled with fake filters, a loud sound design filled with nonsensical effects, and characters who do not think logically.

It reminded me a lot of Hellraiser, only with none of the magic. Unfortunately, for anyone watching the whole series, it's vital that you digest every minute, overwrought plot point.

The Blu-ray present the film in 1.78:1 1080p that exhibits all of the fake color filters in their unappealing glory with a rather old-fashioned DTS ES 5.1 soundtrack. A reasonable amount of extras are included.",1381104000,,2135,4.867768595041323

The cast led by Tobin Bell as John / Jigsaw and Shawnee Smith as Amanda (who, both reprise their roles from the last two ""Saw"" movies) is great. The directing by Darren Lynn Bousman (who directed and wrote the screenplay to the last ""Saw"" movie) is excellent. The screenplay by Leigh Whannell (who wrote the screenplay and story to the first two movies and was an executive producer on this one and the last ""Saw"" movie, who also played Adam in the first ""Saw"" and has an important role in this one, and wrote the story and screenplay with Wan on the upcoming ""Dead Silence"" (2007) & is in the upcoming ""Death Sentence"" (2007), which also directed by Wan) is excellent! The story by Whannell & James Wan (who directed the first one and was an executive producer on this one and the last ""Saw"" movie and wrote the story and screenplay with Whannell on the upcoming ""Dead Silence"" & is directing the upcoming ""Death Sentence"", which also stars Whannell) is excellent! The music by Charlie Clouser (who also did the music to the first two ""Saw"" movies) is excellent, as usual. The cinematography by David A. Armstrong (who also did the cinematography to the first two ""Saw"" movies) is excellent! The film editing by Kevin Greutert (who also did the film editing to the first two ""Saw"" movies) is excellent! The casting by Stephanie Gorin (who also did the casting to ""Saw II"" (2005) is excellent! The production design by David Hackl (who also did the production design to ""Saw II"") is excellent! The art direction by Anthony A. Ianni is excellent! The costume design by Alex Kavanagh (who also did the costume design to ""Saw II"") is excellent! This is an impressive third sequel to a movie trilogy. This is just as inventive or even more inventive than the original ""Saw"" (2004) was, or is and it is surpasses its sequel and even its original by making the movie a little more character driven! This movie will keep you guessing until the very end, or even at the beginning of the movie you will be guessing for a very long time for what is to come!

1559351,3,B00005JPBL,"Saw 2 was *just* good enough to make me want to get the third one. Since it was, like, four bucks here for the Blu-ray, I thought, Why not?

Short version: It's the goriest ""Saw"" yet, but still not as gory as some other flicks, notably the remake of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" (hey, wanna watch forty-five minutes of sadistic rape? Or do you prefer the girl's rather creative and tortuous revenge sequences that would make Jigsaw flinch?), nor is it on the level of some of the classics, like ""High Tension"", ""Suspiria"", or ""REC"", probably because Saw doesn't seem to take itself all that seriously, but the other flicks do. ""Hostel"" also does the same thing, which makes it more potentially disturbing. The entire ""Saw"" series is a bit cheesy, really, and takes a few too many creative liberties when it comes to plot and realism. At least the other films mentioned tried to look realistic, but the Saw series is almost comical in comparison, with far too much emphasis on all that crap about Amanda, and other things virtually none of us cares about. Just get to the damned traps already; we don't give a damn about Amanda or the prequel part or any of that garbage. Since when was ""Saw"" known for its masterful storytelling? Right, never. It's the puzzles that hook us, so stick to the damned puzzles. ""Saw III"" tries way too hard to make itself into a cohesive story, as if anyone cares at all, but it pretty much makes up for it with the traps involved, the entire freaking reason we go to see the films. (Unfortunately, as we all know now, the Saw series got progressively worse as it tried to make itself more than a gorefest with some stupid story thrown in we always skip over in our players).

I was a little worried going in that this was going to be a cash-in sequel that doesn't even try to hide that it's a cash-in sequel--you know, just gore, gore, gore, with no creativity in there, which is why I think anyone watches Saw to begin with. You want to see people die or come close to death through the ""puzzles"" they have to suffer through. Yeah, it's sick entertainment, but it's a good premise, and Saw III actually goes the extra mile here and does multiple ""traps"" at the same time. No one cares about Amanda or anything except the ""traps"", so what we get here is pretty good, and it even has arguably a better twist ending than the second one. It's quite a whopper that you very likely won't see coming. I had a guess, because I knew the plot couldn't be as straightforward as it seemed at first; that wasn't Saw. Something that changed everything had to happen, and here, it does, and it does so with gusto. I have to say, it was very satisfying. The final few minutes with the big reveals are a treat, and you get psyched-out a few times, but not for no reason, but because it's critical to the idea behind Jigsaw's plan.

The short of it? There's plenty of gore, some unique deaths (and one involving drowning in dead exploding pig juice that is rather icky), and the whole twist ending thing Saw always does. The opening one we get is pretty high up there as likely the most potentially disturbing, and for people who love this stuff (like me) and actually like how sick they're willing to go in a film, it was a fun thing to watch (but you've got to admit that the rules were downright unfair for all he had to do--a minute and thirty for all that, plus escaping before he's blown up? Who could do that in a minute and thirty?). It's got the gore, the screams, the pain, all the stuff we love to watch.

The thing is, Saw will never replace the horror films out there that are willing to push the envelope to near-impossible levels. Now, I understand that wide-release horrors can't be on the level of, say, the ""I Spit On Your Grave"" remake, which involved, among other things, a *forty-five minute rape scene*, and someone getting a shotgun through the mouth...in reverse. You'd have to see it to know what I mean. In any case, that was easily NC-17 material, with full-frontal nudity, unrestrained sadistic rape, gratuitous torture, and an emphasis on pain, rather than gore, which actually makes it unique. It's also not quite on the level of ""Hostel"" or ""High Tension"" or ""Suspiria"" or a bunch of other horror flicks, mostly foreign, you've likely never heard of. They get more liberties, or something, I dunno. American horror films don't get as much room to work with, I suppose.

Not bad, not great--too heavy on worthless story none of us watched any of the films for, and too many breaks to go into the history of Jigsaw and Amanda, and other things absolutely no one cares about. Seriously, all we want is traps. Do nothing but give us Jigsaw making traps for 90 minutes, make them creative and well-designed, and we're all happy for it. But start throwing in a story, and our fast-forward buttons start to wear out. Saw III was the beginning of this, and it got worse as time went on, almost totally ruining the series until the disastrous ""Saw 3D"" (now officially retitled ""Saw: The Final Chapter"" because 3D sucks and none of us want it).",1336780800,,5072,4.4907908992416035
1559352,5,B00005JPBL,"All I can say is ""WOW!"" I loved the third installment of the Saw franchise. It's packed with gore and scenes that will make you cringe and look away. Amongst this thick-with-blood film, we have another unique story with yet another climatic twist at the end. ""Saw III"" picks up where ""Saw II"" left off and if you haven't seen the first two Saw movies, I strongly recommend that you watch them first. You'll see through flashbacks to the previous two Saw movies how ""Saw III"" fits together with the other two like a puzzle piece, so all three are linked together perfectly.

Amanda (Shawnee Smith) is back once again and she's vicious! She is a very strong and pivotal character in the film, and Smith does an outstanding job of portraying the violent, emotionally unstable Amanda. As Jigsaw's/John Kramer's accomplice, she is helping him with his latest game, but it's Amanda who is truly put to the test as you will see as the film progresses. John is bedridden, hooked up to a heart monitor, dying from cancer and using an oxygen mask to help him breathe, however he uses his bleak situation as a tool for his game. Amanda kidnaps a woman named Lynn (Bahar Soomekh), a depressed, pill-popping surgeon with marital problems, and takes her to the building where John lays waiting. Lynn's test? Keep John alive until another person in the building completes his series of tests. But it won't be that easy. John will need brain surgery and fast (the brain surgery segment is probably my favorite part in the film). Lynn must do the gruesome surgery and keep John from flat lining, or else the shotgun collar that Amanda placed around her head will go off, and she too will flat line.

The other person going through his own tests is a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a grieving father whose son was hit and killed by a drunk driver. Ever since the tragedy, Jeff has become bitter and emotionally lost, clinging to his deceased son's toys, neglecting his daughter and obsessing about revenge on those responsible for what happened. But Jigsaw has made the perfect game for Jeff, where he will have the ultimate choice to forgive and let go, or continue to let his hatred and hunger for revenge consume him. Jeff will come face to face with all those involved in his son's untimely death; the only witness to the crime who ran from the scene, the judge who gave the driver a light sentence, and finally the man responsible for the death of his son. All are in their own Jigsaw traps and it's up to Jeff whether they live or die. We're treated to some new inventive traps; the Freezing room trap, the pig juice vat trap and the Rack trap that twists limbs.

So the web of John, Amanda, Jeff and Lynn make ""Saw III"" what it is. However there are some other main factors of the movie that are brought to our attention at the start of the film. Take the situation of Troy (J. Larose), a man who seemingly enjoys being in prison more than having freedom. Troy is in a chain trap, where the chains are literally hooked into various areas of his body. He must release himself before a bomb goes off. But we'll find out that there is something different about this particular Jigsaw trap; something that doesn't ring true to Jigsaw's philosophy of earning the privilege to stay alive. Such is also the case with detective Alison Kerry (Dina Meyer), the ever devoted crime investigator from the first two Saw movies who blames herself for the disappearance of detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Whalberg) (yes, he's back for ""Saw III""). According to Jigsaw, she is as dead as the corpses she investigates and therefore has the opportunity to join death as well. She has been put into a ""ribcage angel trap"", where there is a device hooked into her ribcage. She must unlock the device with a key that is inside a beaker of acid within a minute or else......well, you get the picture. But again, this Jigsaw trap is not your average Jigsaw trap. It's seemingly a whole different game.

Fantastic special effects, great acting, intense storyline, new twists, heart-pounding sequences, gore galore and an amazing ending; yes, ""Saw III"" more than delivers. Writers Leigh Whannell (who also appears in a key sequence of this film) and James Wan do it again, and Darren Lynn Bousman is back as director. They do an excellent job of bringing ""Saw III"" together with the first two. As much as I like the first Saw, this one probably beats it out by a hair. ""Saw III"" is horror at its best.

1559457,4,B00005JPBL,"After consecutively watching the entire Saw series over a recent weekend (and LOVING it), I decided that a single review with modified details could be used for all the films.  Enjoy.

A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.

Saw THREE begins with ONE person trapped in an abandoned MEATPACKING PLANT.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) game, JEFF (Angus Macfadyen) has to prove his will to live, and his ability to FORGIVE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), OFFICER DANIEL RIGG (Lyriq Bent), and rugged veteran DET. MARK HOFFMAN (Costas Mandylor) are investigating as a team, but ALLISON KERRY may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participant learns that AMANDA YOUNG (Shawnee Smith) may be an accomplice to his abduction, and his situation provides a choice between VARIOUS TRAPS (for OTHERS) or guaranteed death (for his family).  To help his cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead him (aka life perpetrator) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.

Several murderous contraptions like the CHAIN CHAIR (for a HABITUAL CRIMINAL), the PIG VAT TRAP (for an ACTIVIST JUDGE), and the NECK BREAKER RACK TRAP (for a MURDERER) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the opening scene EXPLODING RIB ANGEL TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S MODUS OPERANDI, and on to Saw IV.

Not because the Saw movies are indicative of good filmmaking -- on the contrary, they are putrid exercises in rehashing a stale formula that didn't really work to begin with.  However, they do achieve some level of financial success, even if that is waning.

The Saw series was never great -- even the first two movies are second-tier at best, however, it wasn't until Saw 3 that the series began its descent into self-parody.

Leigh Whannell's screenplay is assinine, using the approach of ""the more plot twists, the better"".  By the time the third one rolls around, eyerolling commences, not just because they all seem to occur outside the realm of reality, but because they don't allow any of them time to marinate before they start stewing the next one.

Acting, of course, is as over the top as you expect, and the frights are few and far between -- been there, tortured that.

1559599,4,B00005JPBL,"Don't worry, my opinion for part two is coming soon. The weird part for me about this series is I don't like movies with torture-but this series has a demented cleverness to it that I didn't expect. The traps are sadistic but clever, the music is creepy, and Jigsaw's game in this one is something I admire-testing someone's capacity for forgiveness over revenge is a very interesting concept. When criminals go free it does make me angry, but hatred and revenge can have serious consequences, as this chapter demonstrates in gruesome detail. Kudos to Charles Clouser for the music score-I'm not sure even Jerry Goldsmith could've made a score this creepy. Special mention must be made to Tobin Bell as Jigsaw-what he does with his voice, making it raspy to the sound of a whisper was eerily effective,he gives me chills just hearing him talk, and his voice on his tapes are the same way. I'm not gonna lie though, a couple scenes/traps in this one did make me cringe, I look forward to part 5 though.

August 8, 2010
The main focus of this film is on Jigsaw's apprentice forcing a doctor to keep him alive while another test/game is taking place. These tests and traps are creepy to say the least-esp. the pig vat in the middle. I don't want the director's cut of this chapter because I saw the d's cut of the ending and decided I don't need it.
Now, do I think they should've ended the series here? Hell, No! Despite the ending, I'm glad the creators have come up with not just one but 5 decent sequels that connect like a puzzle. After this film though, Leigh Whannell and James Wan stepped aside as scriptwriters, but the replacements so far have done a very nice job in keeping the series interesting, however I wish Darren Lynn Bousman could've continued directing, but oh well.",1264982400,,1784,4.592476489028213
1559600,4,B00005JPBL,"Saw III picks up right where II left off and then forwards goes six months ahead, a new victim is discovered is an inescapable trap. Usually ""patients"" of John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer can escape the games; this time the trap is unusual which brings questions about the inventor of this trap. Saw III is basically a large and complicated game much like the first movie. Jigsaw is dying and Amanda brings in Doctor Lynn Denlon who has to keep him alive for the game's length in order to succeed her game. Meanwhile her husband Jeff is the one playing the ""real"" game which will decide of everyone's fate. This one is also Amanda's big test even if she doesn't know it. The fact that Saw III is so complex, logical and that it makes sense at the same is quite an accomplishment for a horror movie as they rather ignore connectivity from a movie to another, Saw does not. It's obvious that with this third movie they tried to end the trilogy while knowing that there might be a next movie, they could have ended Saw right there if they wanted to. It is the most profitable Saw movie to date having earned an estimated total of $164,874,275 worldwide.

I feel this is one of the better Saw movies, first of all it has a great story and its complicated which I think is what fans will love about it.

However, if you happen to have a more conservative outlook on crime and punishment, then these movies might be for you, if you do not mind extreme blood and gore that is. However, if you do decide to get these movies, just watch it from the first one, otherwise you kinda kill the thrill, but that's just me.",1246147200,,543,4.180952380952381

 So if I said I like SAW 1 cause it was the original or SAW 5 cause it had more gore.

1559915,4,B00005JPBL,"I bought ""Saw III"" because I needed to see it.  You have to understand, I am a large horror fan.  I am also a fan of TV shows like ""Buffy"", ""Angel"", ""Dr. Who"" and ""True Blood"".  Therefore, suffice to say I like serials.  That's why I had to have ""Saw III"".  And (unfortunately) ""Saw IV"". (Heck, I even wasted money on the latest ""Indiana Jones"" drivel.)

When the first ""Saw"" came out, I was captivated.  Great villain, lots of gore.  I loved the whole mythology.  And due to the cliff-hanger style ending, I bought in for ""Saw II"" as well.

And ""Saw II"" was fine.  Decent story line.  Interesting characters.  Good amount of gore.  Liked it.

Then we come to Saws ""III and IV"", which according to Wikipedia happen concurrently.  I liked ""Saw III"" for the gore.  And the plot had enough twists to keep me interested.  There is also the inclusion of the pretty doctor and a good finale which appears to wrap everything up.  Or does it?

I have to admit I only bought ""Saw III"" because of seeing and enjoying Saws ""I and II"".  But it is a fine film, if you like the series and want to see how everything turns out.

Then I went out and bought ""Saw IV"", and as far as I'm concerned that's where it has to stop.  Watch the first three films and you'll see why.  ""Saw V""?  ""Saw VI""?  Give me a break.  What's next...  Jigsaw comes back to life in outer space (a la Jason X)?  No thanks.  Moving on....",1227312000,,1396,4.237547892720307

Jeff has been a depressed dad for three years because his son was killed by a driver named Timothy Young. Jeff has three tests and must learn to forgive the people responsible for the death of his child. My favorite trap in this one is the Pig Vat when Jeff has to save the judge from drowning in ground up pig intestines.

1559918,4,B00005JPBL,"The Saw series keeps movin right along, and fairly well I might add.  Though there is some greatness about the first Saw that gets a little lost in each of the sequals, there is more that is added too.  In the case of Saw 3, I must say the scenerios are as disturbing as ever, and becoming more complex and original.  The movie begins with a bone-crunching (literally) squirming start that already leaves a nasty flavor, and quickly moves to a scene with a man standing in an old classroom, with chains inserted throughout various parts of his body.  The bloodshed gets going in Saw 3, though the real scenario takes about 30 minutes to set-up.

The Saw theme still continues in the third installment - ""are you grateful to be alive?"" and a little more is added to the mix about obsessive vegence.  Such is the case with Jeff.  His son has been killed in an accident.  Jeff is forced through a series of tests, placing him in contact with the various people he wishes were dead since they did nothing to help his situation (eyewitness, judge, and the killer himself).  Jeff's test is to see what lengths he will go to forgive these individuals and save them before the traps they are in expire.  This is where traps in Saw begin to take on a whole new level.  It's not merely bloodshed anymore, and though not always gore-filled, the scenarios are quite frightful such as a naked woman in a freezer room, constantly sprayed with water.  Or a man chained to the bottom of a pit, while hogs are liquified and dumped on him...yes you heard right.  The scene is enough to make one vomit.

While Jeff is being tested, Jigsaw is on his deathbed, and another test is occuring.  Lynn is a doctor who must keep Jigsaw alive or she dies as Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith, who makes a recurring role from all the Saw films thus far) watches in frustration.  Keeping tradition going, you can expect another surprise ending you may not have seen coming, but would say is more predictable than the previous two Saw films.  People are being tested in the film, but in the end you begin to realize the bigger picture and what the bigger tests actually are.

Saw 3 does a great job of keeping things in perspective with the prior films, mostly the first Saw, which is fine by me since it is the original and I thought a stronger movie than Saw 2.  There are plenty of flashbacks of Amanda, how she became Jigsaw's apprentice, and we even get to see some prequal shots that went into the making of the bathroom scene in Saw.  Saw 3 even begins exactly where Saw 2 left, with detective Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg again reprising the role) locked up in that same bathroom.

Saw 3 is a good continuation to the series.  The story remains fairly complex, interesting and somewhat unpredictable, though still looses the greatness of the first two movies.  If you are looking for blood, gore, and terrifying traps, Saw 3 goes all out this time.  I say, just be grateful with your life so you don't have to ever experience them.

1559919,4,B00005JPBL,"As far as just being a movie, this one isn't bad...much better than Saw 2 but nowhere near as good as the original.  As I mentioned in previous reviews, this franchise has a built-in limited shelf life.  There is only so much you can drag out a series like this.  The original Saw was a beautifully gruesome idea that was worked with a brilliant touch of morbid, sick class.  The second movie  was a cheap sequel that made no effort to disguise its cheap, shameless capitalistic quality of just living off the reputation of the original.  This third movie had an obvious influence by Saw originators L. Wannell and J. Wan.  Their writing and influence in this flick shows.  It is a fairly-well thought-out movie premise on its own.  But as I said, this series has its limits as far as how far you can stretch the idea before it becomes ridiculous.  Sure, all movies are fantasy.  They all ask you to believe what can not really happen in everyday life.  And the better movies can get away with asking for more ""fantasy lenience"" than others.  But in a franchise such as this, your limits are being tested before you get to Part 3.  Where does this Jigsaw guy get the resources to perform these grotesque acts on people???  On its own, this is a pretty decent gore movie.  I enjoyed it.  But they are really pushing it when they kidnap a doctor and ask her to conduct brain surgery on Jigsaw in some abandoned warehouse with power tools and aspirin.  The main theme is clever, in a disgusting, sick way.  But, we're reaching the point where continuing this franchise is beating a dead horse.  Where it is obvious that Wannell and Wan put some thought into this movie, the time has come to move on.  If you like that Saw series, this movie is way better than Saw 2, but it makes no effort to contend with the brilliance of the original Saw.  And just so you know, Saw 4 is good, but it's really time to stop!!!  I just heard that a Saw 5 is coming out in the fall.  All I can say is, the horse is dead already!  Seriously, it's dead!!!  Stop beating the dead horse already!!!

This film definately compells the audience to think about deep issues.  We all from time to time run into people who we feel have done us wrong and we fantasize about exacting revenge on them.  Normal people would experience much emotional pain if and when they see another human being suffering regardless of what he has done.  One of the premises of the film is that vengenge does nothing but increase one's emotional pain.  Unlike the previous Saw film, the two main test subjects in the film had a choice to be better people than Jigsaw but choose not to.  They were so consumed with rage and allowed it to get the best of them.

The people who were kidnapped and placed in various torturing/killing machines were objects of rage for the subjects.  The kidnapped people had no control over their fate.  Only the test subjects could stop the machines if they wanted to.

People may complain about films like this but if we read the news every day we see that people for the most part behave the same way (if not worse) as they do in this film.  Most are under the false impression that vengenge solves anything.

1560046,3,B00005JPBL,"Here's the thing that's proving to be somewhat strange for me with the 'Saw' series of horror films. I had seen each of the first three movies in the franchise when they were initially released to DVD, and had developed opinions both good and bad for each of the films at the time. For instance, when I watched the first film, ""Saw"", I really didn't think all that much for the movie, I thought it was alright but not worth all the hype it had received. Then I watched ""Saw 2"" and felt it was a much better movie than the original, I thought the story was improved, and didn't borrow as heavily from other influences. After that I watched ""Saw 3"", but I hadn't seen the first two in so long that I thought the third film contradicted certain elements contained in the first two, and was also much gorier and seemingly short on plot. However, after re-watching each of the movies in the franchise back-to-back my opinions have somewhat changed. I actually found myself liking the original film much better the second time around, and found ""Saw 2"" to be fairly disappointing by comparison, due to a lack of character development and an over-reliance on shock and gore, instead of developing an eerily creepy atmosphere and a story that would deliver genuine thrills as the original film had done. Which brings me to my re-watching of the third film in the series, ""Saw 3"". Going into this film I wondered if my opinion would change as drastically as it had on the previous two films or if it would remain essentially the same as it was after the first time I watched the movie. Either way, I was curious to see what results awaited my repeat viewing of the film that I felt was the weakest in the series thus far.

""Saw 3"" picks up immediately after the events of ""Saw 2"", and we find Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) desperately trying to free himself in order to save his son. However, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) isn't as fair as Jigsaw and has no intention of allowing Eric to escape. After their brutal altercation (essentially tying off the dangling loose ends left over from the previous film), Amanda joins her mentor, the ailing Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), in overseeing their latest series of tests, one involves a doctor (Bahar Soomekh) who is extremely talented and caring in the operating room yet is cold and aloof to her family at home. The second test focuses on a heartbroken father (Angus MacFadyen) who has lost his son in an automobile accident and would give anything to exact vengeance on those he holds responsible. As each of the subjects advance through their own series of tests, Jigsaw's already deteriorating health seems to be declining at an increasingly rapid rate, but this will not deter the maniacal mastermind from seeing his carefully designed plans come to fruition.

When I watched ""Saw 3"" for the first time after it had recently arrived on DVD in early 2007, I initially found the film to be just another standard horror film that was intent on using as much blood and gore as the MPAA would allow in a film. Basically the filmmakers wanted to see just how much they could get away with before the audience was completely disgusted. The traps had seemed more grotesque, and were even more inescapable than those in the previous two films (which it turned out was the case due to Amanda's refusal to give her victims a chance at life, a fact that was shown in several flashbacks throughout the movie), and the results of the traps were even more bizarre and horrifying than what either of the first two films had attempted. Also, I had thought that the story for ""Saw 3"" contradicted certain events of the previous two movies, especially the first movie, and a couple of moments in the second, leaving me wondering why the writers of this installment, James Wan and Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the first film together), would contradict their own work from the original movie.

Well, after finishing ""Saw 3"" for the second time I must say that my opinion of the film has changed in some instances. I found that the story, which I initially found contradictory, was very well put together and was not contradictory in the least. The story also felt more in sync with the tone of the original film, by having Jigsaw and Amanda's traps be more planned out, forcing their victims to take part in them rather than the rather coincidental approach to the second film where the victims seemed to be allowed to avoid the traps if they could. One facet of the story of ""Saw 3"" that I really enjoyed were the flashbacks to events surrounding the first two films, which really deepened the story for the overall franchise and connected each of the films together even more than before. For the most part, I liked that the flashbacks explained the change in how the traps went from being escapable to impossible to survive, and also how careful the planning was for the traps used in the first film. One complaint I did have with the flashbacks was the fact that we are introduced to Jigsaw's past, which was fine, but we are shown a woman with whom he is seemingly in love with, but we learn nothing about her other than the fact that we see them together for a couple of scenes. I really hate it when a movie simply introduces an element into the plot that is intended to be resolved in the next film, so that nothing comes of it in the current movie you are watching. Why bother including a segment in one film if nothing will come of that segment until the sequel, just wait and include the segment when you (meaning the writers) are ready to flesh it out further. Because the segment, though intended to show a much softer Jigsaw from the days before he became the monster he now is, was ultimately pointless and even more irritating due to the fact that it seemed like it's sole purpose was for us to feel some empathy for Jigsaw, and view him more as a normal human who has slipped into a state of insanity, rather than a man who was merely masking the monster hidden deep within.

The traps of ""Saw 3"" were just as I had initially felt, they were way too grotesque and seemed to be intended to shock and gross out the audience as much as possible rather than scare us. I don't understand why horror films have shifted from trying to scare the audience with atmosphere, story and a genuinely creepy villain, but instead have chosen to simply shock us by including as many gross sequences as possible into a 90 minute film, but that's what the powers-that-be must feel is needed to make a successful horror film these days. Maybe it's because we moviegoers have become de-sensitized to such things, that the only way the moviemakers feel they can scare us is by shocking us with as much blood, gore, and sadism as they can get away with under the guidelines of the increasingly liberal MPAA rating system.

As a franchise, the 'Saw' series has definitely fallen into the school of thought within filmmaking that feels it is necessary to show the most gore possible to give the audience a good scare. When this franchise began, the original film was more of an actual horror film, in the vein of the old school horror films from Alfred Hitchcock (""Psycho"") and John Carpenter (""Halloween""), relying more on atmosphere and the audiences own imagination to create genuine thrills with which to scare us, not buckets and buckets of blood. However, over the course of three films, the 'Saw' series has become just another horror franchise, albeit with much better scripts than your average horror movie (which allows these films to rise above the rest of the current crop of horror offerings), but one can definitely see the downward spiral in terms of quality that is occurring within the series.

The characters of ""Saw 3"" were much better than those within ""Saw 2"". This time around I actually cared whether the main characters survived their respective traps, unlike in ""Saw 2"" where I would have been fine if the majority of them failed their tests. The new cast members to the franchise fit into the same profile as those of the previous film. Both of the two new lead characters were portrayed by acting talents that many people would recognize if they'd seen them, but most likely not by their names. Bahar Soomekh (TV's short-lived drama ""Day Break"") was solid as Lynn, the doctor who had all but abandoned her family emotionally, but in the midst of Jigsaw's trial, discovers that she longs for nothing more than to hold her family members yet again. She was so genuine in her desire to do what is right according to the oath she took as a doctor by helping Jigsaw through the pain of his cancer, and at the same time she was so afraid of losing her life to the trap she was in that she was tempted to take a life in cold blood. The character of Jeff, the distraught father, as portrayed by Angus MacFadyen (""Braveheart"") was a character that was so consumed by his thirst for revenge that he teeters on the edge of sanity, and is struggling to retain his last shred of humanity so he can be there for his daughter that desperately wants her father back. Angus portrayed the conflict within Jeff perfectly, each of the trials that he faced tested his thirst for vengeance, while at the same time threatening to strip him of his last shred of humanity, and each time Angus played the indecision perfectly, and in the end gave audiences a character that was so deeply flawed, and yet the audience couldn't help but relate to him and his struggles.

""Saw 3"" is a better movie than ""Saw 2"", and felt more in line with the tone and quality of the first movie. However, as improved as ""Saw 3"" was, it still fell prey to the shortcomings of its predecessor by featuring an over abundance of gross-out moments intended to shock the audience rather than scare it, and way too much blood and gore, to the point that it detracts from the overall movie.

""Saw 3"" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both contain violence, language, and nudity.",1201910400,3,9978,4.5891255605381165

The first problem I have is they always seem to use these ""dumb white guys"" for the protagonists in the films.  it's like, how can you really pull for them and feel sorry for their situation, when their character is borderline unlikable from the get-go?  I also find the storyline abit confusing at times, there is so much going on, you seem to have to be completely wrapped up in all of the films storylines to understand fully what's going on.  As far as gore, this had got to be the most digusting horror film I have EVER seen.  I almost never have to look away from the screen but on this one, I simply cannot watch the brain surgery scene or the twist torture sequence at the end.  I can only look for a second and then immeadiatley look away again.  I guess this could be a good thing, that's why were horror fans right?  This was Shawnee Smith's movie, I love her in some other films, she's always plays quirky roles.  I wish she would have acted more edgy and bizarre like in some of her other roles.

1560049,4,B00005JPBL,"To start, let's review the film itself.

The Jigsaw Killer is back, and he's got new test subjects to toy with. With the help of Amanda, his new apprentice, she sets the stage for their two unwilling participants in his twisted game: Dr. Lynn Denlon and Jeff Reinhart. Before the night is over, one will have the chance at life, another will have a chance at revenge, and another will have the chance for redemption. There's not much else I can say without spoiling the plot, and since this review is geared towards why this 2-disc DVD treatment is superior to the previous versions, let's move on.

Saw III has more plot twists than you can shake a broken arm at, and this film doesn't have too many characters to bog down the action as in the previous film. With a running time of 120 minutes, the Director's Cut of Saw III has more gore and violence than the last two treatments. If you think the directors have run out of trap ideas, believe me when I tell you that there are plenty of moments that caused seasoned horror movie fanatics to cringe and wince at the tortures unfolding before them on the silver screen. If you have already been introduced to the 'Saw' universe, Saw III is required viewing.

As for the DVD treatment of the movie, it's common knowledge these days that the first version of a DVD release is typically not the one with the best features, or the most complete version of the film. The most complete version comes later. The best example I can think of is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner-Five-Disc-Ultimate-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000K15VSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;- I had to wait 25 years for that.

Thankfully, Saw III got the best DVD version (so far) within a year.

When you open the DVD, you're treated to a certificate allowing you to see Saw IV in the theaters for free. However, the ticket was only good until November 10th of 2007. Even if you buy this DVD after that time, the certificate makes a nice collectable for Saw fans.

When you put in the first disc, you have to wade through 5 movie advertisements before getting to the main menu.

At the main menu, there is an endless one minute loop of ""Killer Inside-Messed Up World"" playing in the background. It's my belief that DVD menus shouldn't have music playing, and this is a perfect example: The song is WAY too loud. I'm sure it was put there to direct viewers to the music video on the second disc - but it's simply an annoyance.

Some of the features on the first disc include:
-- Audio commentary by Leigh Whannell, the co-creator of SAW.
-- Audio commentary by Director Darren Lynn Bousman
-- Audio commentary by Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) and Shawnee Smith (Amanda)

There's one choice in the special features section for ""D-Box, Mastering Motion"" - this is a shameless promotion for a company that offers a new way of experiencing motion in movies with special chairs/helmets/etc.

On the second disc, there's a mixed bag of special features.

First, we start with ""Jigsaw's Plan"", a trivia game that tests your knowledge of the three Saw films to date. However, the questions are not randomized and if you get one question wrong, you have to start all over; making the replay value of this feature almost non-existent.

Nest, we have ""Choose the Death"" which allows us to view the scenes of 10 Saw traps from Saw 2 and Saw 3 with commentary from the director. Not a bad feature.

The next feature is ""Looking Tortured"" - I'm not sure who came up with this idea, but it was a pleasant little surprise. 4 people are chosen to have makeup applied to emulate their 'Saw' counterparts. The viewer is shown from start to finish how to create & apply the makeup to look like the perfect Saw victim. Anyone who wants to spend $25 on a Halloween costume can watch this and make a better one themselves.

Hydrovibe offers us a music video of ""Killer Inside-Messed Up World"" with Shawnee Smith offering additional vocals. This video wasn't bad, but it felt like it was tacked on at the last minute. You'll probably find yourself saying ""Hey, isn't this that annoying song playing in the background on the first disc?""

""Filmmaker Faves"": This feature is totally unnecessary. Do you lay awake at night wondering about Leigh Whannell's favorite line/scene/trap of the Saw series? This is good for trivia night, but it's really not needed. Plus, the font of the lettering is hard to read here.

The last feature is a ""Sneak Peek at Saw IV"". This scene is mainly to wet the appetites of those folks eagerly awaiting the next Saw movie to come out on DVD, and they will not be disappointed.

The first batch of SAW III DVD's were out in January of 2007, The ""Unrated Edition"" and the standard edition. Both of these DVD's had features that did not make it to this version, such as some deleted scenes, commentaries, and trailers.

If you are looking for the longest running, most complete version of Saw III, this is the version for you.

1560051,3,B00005JPBL,"The saw trilogy is a continuos story. When they wrote saw, I am sure they did not have trilogy in mind. Infact saw was not even intended for mainstream theatre release when it was in it's initial project stage. The success of saw :-) saw to it that 2 and 3 came out. The success is due to the originality of the story, the plotting, the ingenious wretched instruments of torture/death and the gore. I have not seen gore of such a raw nature in any other movie. It is clinical and methodical gore'n'guts. saw 2 is the best of the saw3 (I haven't seen 4 yet) so saw2 got 5 stars, saw3 gets only 3 stars.

Traps in 3 include: a) Angel trap (my fav) - metal parts stitched to the ribs so when the wings open, its bye bye ribs. Everything comes flying apart. Basically you end up missing your whole torso. 2) pig mincer 3) body wrencher - neck, legs, and arms are wrenched 360 degree to provide some cool and inventive death/torture 4) big freeze 5) head detonation. (they actually show you the stump that gets left behind eeeeks !!!!)  SFX guys you rock in this movie. This movie is all about the FX. The pigs were artifically made so that they cud be thrown in the pig mincer/juicer scene. watch the fx commentary on the extras in the ""traps section""

Extras on dvd is pretty cool. There is the ""the traps of Jigsaw"" which shows every trap from story board, production design and sfx level. And there is also a director's audio commentary. There is a ""making of"". You'll be find renting this one beter off. I don't think you want to be watching this one every week else you'll end up with insomnia.

This one is not as psychological as 2. This is more in your face blood and guts. Its all about ribs flying apart, intestines comming out, bones being broken and heads being blow apart. Pls be warned this one is the most most grossest of the whole series. I mean it. Walk away from this movie if this kind of stuff gives you insomnia or nightmares.

Just watch the movie for what it is. If you are squeamish about blood and gore, you won't be renting this one out anyway. The Critics on many sites have panned the whole saw series. I think it's unfair to judge the movie as bad from the angle that there is too much gore. you have to first be a fan of the genre and then judge it within the genre of blood'n'guts films. Thing is saw is so cutting edge, new age and barrier breaking that I don't think there's been a movie like saw. The images are pretty gruesome and not for the faint heartened.

Saw 3 is a total epsiode continuation of saw2. The characters start basically where they left off in 2. So if you don't see saw2 before seeing this one, you won't be able to make sense of the movie flow and login as there are a lot of flash backs to saw 2 . The set from saw 1 refuses to go away. The cut ankle is still lying there in that toilet and those ppl are still there with their decomposing bodies. ""Ohh yes there will be blood"" he said. And you know what, 3 doesn't delievers blood alone, it just spills out ribs, guts and flesh. Satisfaction gauranteed.

1560252,4,B00005JPBL,"Pretty up close and personal as far as seeing ""Jigsaw's"" innards.  Still a lot of complicated traps and tricks.  Also some flashbacks. Watch carefully before seeing Saw 4 (Which is really, really confusing).  A lot of what happens in Saw 3 is related to Saw 4.  Not the worst of the series.  Saw 4, so far, is the hardest to figure out. Again the situations and characters in the first 3 films are all involved in Saw 4.
All in all, Saw 3 sticks to the basic premise and ""gross out"" pattern of the other Saw movies.  I understand there are to be six Saw films.  I suppose once they're all on DVD, the plan will be to see them all back to back.  Oh yes, the commentary track is pretty good.  It's fun to hear the way the effects were done and how the story developed.  You really need to have seen the other Saw films for this one to make sense.  Unlike Saw 4 which, even if you've seen the previous 3, is a jumble.  Still, for just the blood and guts (and the fun of knowing it's movie guts so no one is really getting hurt,) it's worth seeing.  And the HD quality makes you want to check the carpet in front of the TV for blood splatters.
For fans of the Saw series, who have seen the others, a must have.  As a stand alone film, gross, but the ""plot"" will be lost.",1193961600,,1266,4.0728744939271255
1560253,4,B00005JPBL,"Wow, two reviews in one day. What a treat for you, my loyal readers.

""Saw III"" is actually a good movie. For the first time in the series they deliver what the promised. They live up to thier potential. There are some flaws though.

First let me give you a brief summary of the plot. ""Saw III"" picks up exactly where ""Saw II"" left off. Dectective Matthews is held in the custody of Jigsaw's new apprentice Amanda (remember her). He is in the same room that was used with the two main characters in ""Saw I"". Quickly that somewhat wrap his storyline up, and then be prepared to forget about him for quite some time. We then meet the main characters or victims of this film. The first is a Doctor who is taken captive by Amanda, to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to witness his newest test subject. Jigsaw is not in good shape and it looks like he could die at any second. If Jigsaw dies, the doctor will lose her head, as a device is strapped to around her neck that will go off if she moves to far away, or if Jigsaw flatlines. We then meet the new test subject. His name is Jeff, and his son was killed in by I think a drunk driver, or at least a bad one. He is set on the path of forgivness. For the longest time he has neglected his daughter and his whole life to a life of obsession, obsession over killing the people he has blamed for the death of his son. Now he has the chance. In each room there is one person who he has blamed for the death of his son, and he has the chance to save them from the contraptions that they are in, or let them die. And lying at the end of the game is the man who killed his son.

Their is also the development of Jigsaw's new apprentice Amanda. (Remember Becker? She was the dumb secretary). Unfortunatly for the people she tests, she does not follow the same rules that Jigsaw does. Outside the main story thier are a few other people that are affected by her. But she speacializes in false hope. She gives them truly impossible situations to get out of, and even if they do exactly as she has asked them to do they are doomed. While it is more cruel than Jigsaw, it makes the concept a little bit less interesting. But don't worry, it is all made up for in the conclusion.

The acting in this movie is good. They tell us what is expected of the characters, and the consequences that would happen if they don't follow. And the characters for the first time in this series remember that. This is not like the second one where it was all about the killings. This time the killings actually help to further the plot, not just to please the audience. The writing is more natural than it has been in the last 2, and it has a very pleasing ending, making me wonder how exactly they did the next one. But I know they did because ""Saw IV"" is already out in theaters.

They also throw in some information to further explain events in ""Saw I"" and ""Saw II"". This was interesting and fun, and made ""Saw II"" a little bit more worth my watching it. But another movie should not be needed to make another one worth watching.

Because they made the cast smaller than the second one, and they increased the length of this movie, there was more time for character development in this movie. Although sometimes it can seem a bit forced, it works.

A few problems. Although they offer a little bit of an explanation to what happend to Detective Matthews, they don't show 100% what happend to him. Some things don't further the plot, they are just there to put in a fun or interesting scene. I had another but I forgot it so it must have not been that horrible.

All in all this movie is pretty fun, and has gotten me excited again for this series. I will probably go see ""Saw IV"" tomorrow or the day after and I look forward to giving you my review.

1560254,5,B00005JPBL,"A mistake corrected, and a distorted means are justified by the ends...thank you to the creators who were just as unhappy as I with leaving it at the end of saw 2.",1193270400,,163,4.125
1560255,5,B00005JPBL,Can anyone tell me what the difference is between the Unrated version and the Director's cut?,1193011200,,93,4.875
1560256,2,B00005JPBL,"""SAW III"" or the entire ""SAW"" franchise for that matter has already been known as one of the goriest horror/suspense series (except, probably ""Hostel"" and some of Miike's films), so I expected what I would see from the beginning. Frankly I didn't care the amount of blood or violence, but when the story seems to be repeating itself, there must be a problem. Actually some part of ""SAW III"" is only repeating what we already know in the previous two films (though it is told from a different perspective with flashbacks).

But what is most disappointing for me is that in ""SAW III"" the intriguing relations between Jigsaw and one character (you know who) are not fully developed. The filmmakers, it seems, spent most of energy to set up various methods of tortures, which is fine, I admit, but they could have created something more interesting out of the master-pupil-like relations between them with more subdued approach and less swearing.

I also find the film shows its hand too early. During the film's story, we only wait for the next ""challenge"" to start and the results are now fairly predictable. (Remember the first ""SAW"" of which script showed some intelligence even in the gory trap scenes). And if Jigsaw is terminally ill, how did he manage to set up such elaborated torture machines?

The only scene I was interested is the brief moment where Jigsaw's past is suggested. After all it is him and his eccentric personality that has made ""SAW"" a cut above other slasher films. Let's see what happens next in the forthcoming fourth installment because considering how ""SAW III"" wraps up, to continue the plot after that would be the hardest part of the entire series.",1192924800,,1679,4.802768166089965

1560260,3,B00005JPBL,"While Saw3 is certainly still more impressive than most horror sequals(not to mention original movies), there is an undeniable frustrating emptiness feel that even the die-hard fans would have to admit ths time round.

I won't go into plot details, because I do not believe they are the purpose of reviews...reviews should only give you an insight into the reflective feel one gets from watching a film.

Needless to say, If you have watched Saw and Saw2, I would advise to watch the third movie...but lower any hope you have of finding closure.

The series is literally being made up as it goes along, and the creators are completley losing the sense of how to tell a story and seem more eager to get internet discussion boards thriving on rumors and tales of what we didn't see.

This is what makes Saw3 the weakest installment, the creative hold is getting to strong and effecting the pace and style of the film.

Saw and Saw 2 were both entertaining and had a great sense of a filmaker who wanted to trick the audience..leave them muttering ""I did not see that coming!"" Then the director would pop out from behind the curtain and laugh with audience and elobarate on the film.

Saw 3 fails at this vitaly major draw that the series had, primarily because one gets the sense the Director is no longer behind the curtain,
because he is already scripting Saw4 and Saw5..and yes, Saw6.

This completely undermines what the film heavily relies upon..the suspnse has to work...and here it doesn't, the trick doesn't entertain, because the magican stops halfway through and moves onto another trick, then again and again.

I like films that make an audience wonder, but deliberate overuse of these
elements is just promoting the belief that without Saw being a secret..It's very little indeed.

The Script is so elaborate, so logically challenged, that the only way to distract the audience is by these ""What happened there?"" Questions that are riddled throughout.

Picture you are watching an entertaining thriller, and the person next to you keeps asking you to divide and multilpy numbers at the same time.

That's the unavoidable feeling one gets with Saw3.

If the creators weren't money greedy fools, perhaps we could have had an outstanding trilogy that begins and ends..instead, this is already becoming an endless remix of a song that doesn't end,
""yes it goes on and on my friend"".",1190851200,2,2388,4.825980392156863
1560420,3,B00005JPBL,"I am not usually attracted to this type of film...slasher/horror flicks, that is. I find most of them a waste of money and time, to be honest. This is why I was genuinely shocked at how I truly loved the first two ""Saw"" films, realizing they exercised absolutely brilliant examples of film-making, acting, and special effects. Both films had a genuinely awesome screenplay with well-written, realistically portrayed dialogue...and of course, forgetting the almost-too-intense amounts of suspense both films lavished upon its viewers would be criminal. Some of the scenes in those films brought on the nail-biting suspense I hadn't felt since Ridley Scott's ""Alien."" I remember being sick with jealousy after watching the first film that novice filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell could create such a brilliant, intricate, breathtaking horror film that had just the right amounts of blood & guts mixed with a truckload of otherworldly suspense. I remember after watching the second film that Darren Lynn Bousman seriously has got a future on his hands with an exquisitely directed ""Saw II."" So, naturally, I felt more than compelled to view the third installation of the ""Saw"" franchise before the fourth film hit theaters. Described as ""staggeringly violent"" and ""sadistically horrific,"" along with the true incidents of audience members vomiting and fainting in the theater, I felt less and less excited about the third Saw film, and began thinking it was nothing more than a Halloween horror film face-off between Saw III and Hostel to see which film could possibly be more sickeningly violent. In addition, I began to think ""How could a third film possibly live up to the caliber of the first two?"" After viewing the third film, I really wasn't sure what to think of the theory of the film being violent just to be violent. But here's what I generally thought of the third installation to the brilliant ""Saw"" franchise. The interlocking two-part story deals with a fatally ill Jigsaw capturing a doctor who must keep him alive for however long it takes for a man, who is psychologically insane with his lust for revenge for the drunk driver who killed his son, to maneuver through a series of Jigsaw's infamous ""traps."" Jeff, the man, is not actually in the traps, though--it's the people who he's been vengeful towards regarding the death of his son--for instance, the judge who locked away the killer for only a short period of time, and witnesses who didn't do anything. Jeff has the power to stop these traps--find it within himself to forgive them. Either that, or watch them get slaughtered in ways too shocking to write about in this review.

That said, Saw III is definitely a step up when it comes to the gore meter compared to the first two films. Some of the traps are so sickening you feel compelled to turn away from the screen. People vomiting in theaters, though, is a gross overreaction. I ate pizza while watching and I wasn't really nauseated or anything. Don't let that fool you, though--Saw III is extremely violent and the violence in the first two films is pale compared to it. There are plenty of moments where I cringed and thought to myself, ""Holy crap, that's just wrong."" While a part of me wants to condemn the film for being so excruciatingly violent, I can't help but think the violence was a necessary aspect to the story. You'd really have to see the film to know what I'm talking about here, but anyway, Saw III might've competed with Hostel for ""most violent award"" but the gore wasn't extremely over-the-top or too intense to watch.

Which brings me into my next point--the storyline. As I said in the first paragraph, the story lines for the first two film blew me out of the damn water with their brilliance. This is where the third film declines--and steeply, at that. The development of new characters is handled extremely poorly and in the end, you really don't give a flying crap who dies and who is left living (extremely unlike the second film). The acting is both up and down at different times. Shawnee Smith (Amanda) and Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) are absolutely top notch, as always. Smith's performance, especially towards the end of the film, sent chills down my spine and Bell never fails to disappoint. Yet, literally every single other actor/actress in the film didn't deliver, and that for me was major point loss.

I liked the directing, editing, and cinematography. Especially the cinematography, which reminded me immensely of the 2004 Denzel Washington action flick ""Man On Fire,"" also dealing with the human spirit's lust for revenge at the loss of another. Fortunately, Darren Lynn Bousman's above-average skills as a film director manage to balance a close-to-falling Saw III and keep it shakily on its feet. Again, I blame this on the weak story. Yet, it is hardly fair for me to completely condemn the story. The screenwriters did a very good job incorporating flashbacks into the film, and explaining elements from the first two films that may have been considered plot holes in the past. This aspect to Saw 3 was immensely enjoyable and made for a good film.

Though, the ending was also very poor, in my opinion. It is very depressing, unhealthy, and unsatisfying like a Big Mac. You almost feel at a complete loss--the events building up from the beginning of the film (and, for that matter, the other two films as well) end up--like this? Bleh. Been there, done that. There also is no shocker at the end, unlike the first two films which each had shockers that pretty much blew the brains out of your ears and left you speechless and unable to move.

Still, though, Saw 3 is a decent film. But it should be understood that unless you are EXTREME fans of the first two films, as I am, you should stay away from this movie. You'll be revolted and disappointed, to say the least. But for hardcore Saw fans, it should be rather pleasing. I don't think ""Saw 3"" was a great film, But it certainly is decent and I've seen FAR worse. I have hopes for the fourth film that it may redeem the third film and restore the hopes of me and a million others that a great movie--turned into just a decent one--can be brought back to greatness.

However, THIS film kept my attention and at certain points, made me realize how craftfully this story was written (and acted).

No empty scares. No meaningless slashings. This is a story of mind games and punishment for the weak or undeserving. <shiver>

Jigsaw, the main-mean-man, is in rare form, and his sidekick, Amanda, is a nice, rounded character. I loved hating her and felt sorry for her at times.

The tale is layered and deep with theme. The gore is fun and realistic! Love the hog slaughter! The torture devices in this volume are HARSH.

This was a similar tactic used in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, what was not seen seemed so much worse. With Saw 2, things took a little more graphic turn, there was still a nice twist ending, and the story wasn't as heavy handed, there was a ""fun"" element to the story. Saw 3 cranks up the gore, and slaps the viewer with a heavy, very melancholy storyline. Saw 3 is so depressive, there is really no one to cheer for, you really don't care who lives or dies as there is really no character development, and the two new main characters/victims are so unlikable you begin to lose interest. While I agree Saw 3 wraps up loose ends from Saw 2, it ends up presenting so many new questions that it doesn't feel like a complete film. Now you will have to see part 4 when it comes out to see how the storyline of part 3 wraps up. I don't care any longer, I am done playing Jigsaw's game.

I recommend it for the people who liked Saw 1 and Saw 2, as it is a story being continued. There isn't much tricks or traps in Saw 3, but the ones that exist are extraordinary and will not get you bored. I hurt when they hurt, i held on to my chair when there was a painful scene, and the suspense kept my teeth stuck together...

Some may think it's disgusting to watch so much blood out of a person in one movie, but the blood is just the end of it; what's more interesting and worth the watch are the traps used and the story...",1178064000,2,593,3.8925619834710745
1560561,3,B00005JPBL,"Saw II is that rare horror movie that is just as good if not better than the original.  Depending on what you thought of Saw, Saw II looks to be about as demented, and makes about as much sense as Saw.

The film opens with another hapless fool waking up in another music-video-leftover room with another insane device attached to his head.  The serial killer Jigsaw (who has never killed anyone) informs him via video that he has about a minute to cut out his eyeball to retrieve a key to unlock the venus-flytrap device on his head.  Argh!  From there we are introduced to a weary cop with family troubles who is being personally called out by Jigsaw.  Before long, we find out that Jigsaw has kidnapped his son, along with a bunch of other idiots and placed them in a booby trapped house with poison gas being pumped through the vents and a time limit for them to endure sick, twisted, horror-movie-traps and tests in order to prove how badly they want to live.

Don't think too closely about this one, as by the end it makes even less sense than the twist of the original.  And yes, there is a twist of sorts.  The movie looks like the original, meaning it looks like a Nine Inch Nails video and has all the editing of the ADD school of filmmaking which is now apparently a pre-req for making at least 50% of movies.  The ridiculous editing is getting out of hand now---why do they feel the need to TELL you visually that it's time to get tense, or scared?  Are the filmmakers too uneasy about the material and their ability to just rely on the situation, the script, the actors?  Do I need to see crack head editing and lights and that over-produced dirt and grime in every movie in order to feel anything?

These movies are not scary in the least, masking a lack of imagination in the horror/fear department, but plenty of imagination in the 'how else can they die' department.  Cruelty and tastelessness are the new horror genre checkpoints, I guess it's a lot easier than creating genuine scares or fear.  How about babies in a blender, that'd be a good horror flick.  These films can be demented fun for 90 minutes and can be a lot of fun in a crowded movie theater, but they're overdone and over-stylized.  The visuals don't show you as much as tell you (with the same lighting, editing, colors) that this is a horror film.  The moral 'message' of the killer, or the writers, is perhaps the real reason this is a horror film.

Plenty of extras about the making of the film and the traps, all the work that goes into this madness, new ways to torture and kill people, and other wonders.  It's always nice to see that artistic, creative people can make a living designing torture contraptions for fictitious serial killers (fictitious today, that is), and that those serial killers become 'beloved' characters to American audiences.  There's a 2 DVD set out there as well, though this single disc unrated widescreen edition should suffice for most folks.  I would bet the house that Saw becomes a video game or a series of them, the possibilities for interactive sadism are too much for them not to hybridize Saw.

1560707,4,B00005JPBL,"Unlike Saw II, Saw III starts off on shaky ground and feels a bit forced. The traps are gorier and harder, while we find that we don't care all that much about the characters themselves. The acting is still good, but the story doesn't seem to meet the muster of the first sequel.

The unresolved surprise ending involving Detective Matthews in Saw II is dealt with thoroughly here and answers many questions. But Saw III involves a new cast of characters to be tested by Jigsaw's games. Along with his sidekick Amanda, Jigsaw has kidnapped a female doctor and hooked his life support system to a device around her neck that will fire six rounds into her head if his heartbeat ever stops. Meanwhile a man whose son was a victim of a hit and run is forced to walk through rooms where each person who took part in that incident is being tortured in front of him.

As the film goes on, the suspense seems to be dropping as the audience wonders why they should care about any of this. And although Jigsaw and Amanda provide a formidable evil duo, the momentum begins to drop due to an excess of gore and a cacophany of screams.

In the end, though, it all pays off, and although the film itself doesn't live up to the original sequel, it's still much more interesting and mind-bending than most other horror films of this time. For a 3rd installment in a franchise, Saw III is a top-quality movie. The twists and the twisted nature of the film will leave fans eager for a fourth.",1174867200,,1474,4.431734317343174

While 'Saw' had a unique story, this remains in the brain for all of 5 minutes after it is turned off and revels in sadism and ridiculous logic for what seems like an ice age. Firstly Jigsaw should not have been revealed and an attempt to make him more 'human' with a flashback to his former life is just ridiculous. Plus why does he torture people as punishment for leading amoral lives? isn't his just as amoral?

The other characters in the film are witless, particularly the man assigned to 'play a game' which is based on showing mercy (or not) to the various people involved in the car crash which killed his daughter, this moron takes far far too long to make what should be split second decisions - watch the scene with the guy in the twister device and you'll see what I mean.

1560710,3,B00005JPBL,"The first ""Saw"" was cool, and clever, but this one takes the cake. It doesn't matter that I haven't seen Saw II yet, they all stand on their own pretty well. Though I do plan on seeing the second one.

Saw III featured some Great torture rigs and contraptions. Appalling is an understatement. I'm a horror fanatic from way back and some of the scenes in this movie made me shutter and wince. Okay, I was actually squeemish during a few parts, must be losing my edge. It is definitely not for the faint-hearted.

The plot is strong too. We get the rundown on what's really been going on behind the scenes through the other Saw movies, but it's not necessary to see those films to appreciate this one. Strong story, good directing and excellent set design, camera work.

There is a lot of jumping around between past and present so be alert, it can get confusing. I actually found that back and forth to be a little annoying. Also there were a few parts that seem insignificant, but I guess they serve to give us insight into the characters. One example is the girl who play's Jigsaw's psycho-let's test your will to live-in-training, and the part where she sits down and begins carving a line into her leg. We see other lines there so we can establish fairly quickly that she has issues, though I think we're be able to get that early on in the film anyway.

The acting was good in most cases, but Jigsaw's protege delivered some pretty weak lines.

I recommend this to any horror fan with a strong stomach. But it is not for the squeemish or easily offended. This is a seriously gruesome, and violent film.",1174176000,,1606,4.467576791808874

This film is definitely not for the squeamish.  I had to look away from the screen a few times.  The crime scenes you seen in CSI are G-rated compared to what you'll see here.  As a warning, don't eat while you're watching this film because you'll definitely lose your appetite.

Jigsaw is at it again...except that he is dying.  Once again, Amanda (the sole survivor of Jigsaw's games from the first film) joins Jigsaw.  In this film, you'll see just how much Amanda is involved and why she holds Jigsaw dear.

A doctor has been kidnapped to keep Jigsaw alive.  As long as Jigsaw is alive, she'll stay alive.  If he dies, she dies as well.  Meanwhile, a man has been kidnapped and is going through a game.  This man lost a son to a drunk driver and has since been obsessed with vengenance.  In this tailored game, he has to decide whether to forgive certain people or let them die in their own games.

As I said before, Jigsaw is dying.  Amanda is emotionally unstable.  The doctor does everything to keep Jigsaw alive.  The grieving father is advancing towards his freedom.  Just who makes it out alive?  Who dies?  Just like the first and second movies, there's a twist.  The twist is so good that you won't believe you didn't think of it before.

Yes, it appears that Saw III is the end of the series as we know it (doubtful though) as Jigsaw's increasingly debilitating health leads him and Amanda (Shawnee Smith) to orchestrating one last, terrifying game.  This time around, a doctor (Bahar Soomekh) and her vengeful husband (Angus MacFadyen) are now pawns in what could be Jigsaw's last game; and needless to say, things don't turn out well for anyone at all.  Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed the lacking second film in the series, returns to helm this chapter, and does considerably better this time around.  The traps and death scenes aren't as intricately put together as what we've seen before, but they're all the more grisly.  The gore level gets upped as well, as people are tortured and dispatched in ways that if they don't make you squirm, consider seeking help.  James Wan and Leigh Whannel, who crafted the first film in the series, are reportedly done with the franchise, but rumor has it that Lion's Gate won't let the Saw series ride off into the sunset just yet.

1560833,2,B00005JPBL,"""Saw III"" should have been the epic, horrifying end to this demented series; unfortunately, it wasn't epic and it probably isn't the end of the series at all.

The reason I enjoyed the first film was not the gore, although I have to admit I was impressed by the openly brutal scenario of people having to hack their own legs off in order to survive (one either overcomes the fear of horrendous physical pain or dies), but because it had a soul and a brain behind it: an atmosphere of mystery and horror pervaded it.  No one knew who was the vicious mastermind behind these inventive and repugnant torture/murders or who would go to such lengths to prove something to society about the depreciation of life. Saw II"" carried on in a similar vein; more was revealed about Jigsaw and he was face to face with an angry cop who wanted his son back.  Still, we didn't know anything about him and it never became too personal; he remained a ghastly enigma with an intriguingly intelligent and thoroughly evil persona.

In this movie, though, they make the character that could have rivalled Hannibal Lecter into a soap opera.  The film begins promisingly (an ex-con gets permanently reformed in a rather unorthodox way) and Jigsaw, ironically, has to face his own mortality through his imminent death by cancer.  From there it degenerates into tedious emotional dynamics involving his protege Amanda, a young doctor with a time operated shotgun shell collar around her neck, and plays an extended and really ridiculous ""game"" with a blameless victim of a drunk driver.

The character Jeff and his ""vengeance conflict"" (how can you blame the guy for not wanting to save the guy who ran over his child?) is really just an excuse for us to watch Jigsaw's demented assistant indulge in emotional drama about her checkered and boring past.  Things get so monotonous that nothing shocks anymore.  The end is the most ridiculous plot twist I've ever seen and it isn't enduring what precedes it.  If they were going to do this, they should have ended the series with the original.",1173312000,2,2064,4.756302521008403

Saw III had me at the edge of my seat the entire time! I liked the fact that the movie was very character driven instead of just relying on the intense amounts of gore the franchize is famous for. The only real problem I noticed in the movie was the less-than-believable acting by some of the characters. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has seen the previous 'Saws'.",1173312000,2,644,4.608695652173913

Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman. Written by Leigh Whannel.
Third movie in the series.

Returning: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Donnie Wahlberg, Dina Meyer, Leigh Whannel, Lyriq Bent, Franky G., Kelly Jones, Vincent Rother, Timothy Burd and Billy the puppet.

  The ending of this Unrated version is different than the Director's Version. More gore included.
SAW II (2005) was a huge success!  When we last left the intense dilemma, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) had beaten Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and through the maze of walls and doors in the warehouse, it was a race against time to find his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) and the other victims. Amanda was the culprit and Eric found himself in the bathroom from SAW (2004). He was trapped, shackled, shut-in and yelling for his life.

  The movie begins at the exact frame where SAW II ended.
  Officer Kerry (Dina Meyer) can not find Eric (Donnie Wahlberg), but her and Forensic Hoffman (Costas Mandylor)  find the remains of Troy (J. Larose). We are treated with scenes of him shackled with chains embedded into his skin.  Since Kerry is so clever in solving the crime, she too becomes a prisoner of Jigsaw.
  We are introduced to two new characters: Lynn and Jeff.
  Lynn (Bahar Soomekh),who is a doctor, is captured in the hospital locker room by someone wearing a pig head. By Amanda (Shawnee Smith) she is brought to Jigsaw John, who is gravely ill lying in a hospital bed in a new secret place, the Gideon warehouse.  He wants Lynn to help him live. A collar device is put over her. There are 5 cocked gun barrels on this collar. If Jigsaw John's heart rate flat lines or she moves out of range, she will die at the same time as him.
  A man, Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), is trapped in a crate box. Jeff escapes and as he wonders through the warehouse, finds other people in deadly traps, Danica (Debra McCabe), Judge Halden (Barry Flatman) and Timothy (Mpho Koaho). He has his own series of tests to go through. That's part of the game.

  For SAW fans, new footage: Amanda will reflect upon how she became involved with Jigsaw John and then preparing for the first game we saw in SAW (2004).

Also in the cast: Alan Van Sprang, Niamh Wilson, Betsy Russell, Mark Poyser, Bill Vibert, Kim Roberts, Zoe Heath.

Contains female frontal nudity.

  Costas Mandylor appears as ""Forensic Hoffman"" in SAW 3. This is a very important clue for SAW 4.

  Best line: ""The only place that he can get those drugs is in the hospital"".
  Writer and Executive Producer Leigh Whannel plays ""Adam"".
  The neck collar was once worn by Tina Turner in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985).

Filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

1561001,2,B00005JPBL,"Saw III (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2006)

Well, the good news is that James Wan returned to do some of the script work for Saw III. The bad news is that James Wan only returned to do some of the script work for Saw III. Wan, who also directed the first film, created one of the enduring horror movies of the decade so far; Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed the second film in the franchise, turned in what was, at best, just another cheesy survival thriller that lacked any echo of the characterization, complexity, and finesse that made the first one so good. Guess who directs Saw III?

I'm sure you've seen at least one sitcom episode where there's a loose frame story that exists for the sole purpose of replaying amusing scenes from earlier in the season. That's, in part, the direction Saw III takes-- there's a lot of flashback footage in this movie. Which is really kind of depressing, because Wan came up with a real barnburner of a story idea here-- Jigsaw (Tobin Bell, reprising his role) and his assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith, reprising hers) are the focus here. They've kidnapped Lynn (Crash's Bahar Soomekh), a doctor with marital problems, to keep Jigsaw alive during his final game, one in which Jeff (Titus' Angus McFadyen) must forgive the driver who killed his son in a hit-and-run accident, as well as a number of others who, directly or indirectly, contributed to his son's death. Jeff's game, however, is almost a background here, as the focus remains on Lynn, Amanda, and Jigsaw. And, of course, there's an awesome twist ending (with the most blatant ""if you're not paying attention, you'll miss it"" clue since Profondo Rosso) that leads us straight into Saw IV. And had Wan's idea been perfectly translated, I have no doubt this would have been an excellent movie, easily the equal of the first one.

""Perfectly translated,"" however, it is not. It has once again gone through the blender that is Leigh Whannell, but again without Wan's butt in the director's chair mitigating Whannell's inability to characterize. We see an even worse flaw of Whannell's in the opening scenes of Saw III: Dina Meyer, Costas Mandylor, and Donnie Wahlberg's characters, all of whom survived Saw II, appear in the movie's opening scenes and are eliminated for no reason. (Well, there's a reason, but it's a desperately flimsy one that's obviously the thinnest of layers over ""hey, we have cool devices and nowhere else in the movie to use them."") While the movie's better than its predecessor, ""better"" is something of a relative term. It's certainly not the equal of the first film, but it doesn't quite have the ""let's trample all over the legacy of the first film"" feel to it that the second one does.

This was the first Blu Ray disc I watched on my PS3.  I also own the Toshiba A1 HD DVD player so I've seen a lot of high def movies.  As with most high def movies, the picture was very sharp and saturated in brighter scenes.  In darker scenes, the picture was more noisy and looked like regular DVD.

However, in the end, it's the same shocking puzzle coming to a surprising conclusion. When it's all said and done, you sit back and watch the credits and think...""man that was scary, and as usual that was some ending!""",1172361600,2,544,4.29126213592233

1561005,1,B00005JPBL,"It never fails. If you somehow manage to get through the first and second film it's always at this point in most franchises where it usually goes down in flames. They manage to flush all the ideas that made the first 2 films so good right down the toilet. First of all, I wasn't crazy about the first ""Saw"", but ""Saw 2"" was really good, and most importantly for me the 2 tied in together. I hate it when they make a sequel and it has absolutely nothing to do with the first film. Not to say that this movie has nothing to do with the first 2 films, I'm just merely stating that I hate when they make movies like that in general. Anyway, deep down inside I knew this would stink, I guess I was just curious, and I had a little extra cash to splurge. Anyone who is familiar with the ""Saw"" movies know that you can expect a huge twist at the end. However, in this film, the end is where it fell flat. I guess if you like endings where everybody dies, and nothing is solved, then you'll like this. I felt like it was sort of cliffhangerish (if that's even a word). I don't see how there can be another sequel, but we all know they'll find a way even if it's a copycat to carry on the Jigsaw's work. At any rate, I think another sequel is pretty much a guarantee. This movie is just meaningless gore and unecessary violence with a horrible ending that managed to destroy the first 2 movies for me. American filmakers need to understand that you can't rely on showing a whole bunch of gory, nasty, and bloody scenes to the audience everytime you run out of ideas, and you know the movie blows. I notice they tend to do that quite often these days. They replace  the plot and storyline for blood and violence. That's not entertainment, that's a distraction, and it's plan-B just in case plan-A doesn't work. Distract us from the fact that the movie is so bad and show us a lot of scenes to gross us out instead. They know that our society is based on so much violence that's enough to satisfy a lot of people. However, I'm not so easily impressed. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some of the concepts though. I do think it was pretty sick to do brain sugery on someone with power tools while their still awake. That was a good scene for me, but that's about it. Needless to say, don't waste your time waiting on the big payoff because you'll be disappointed.",1172102400,4,2356,4.247216035634744

Secondly, the signature ""shocking"" ending of Saw series was not too shocking in Saw 3.

Sound like fun? Then...it's your future...I see Saw III in your Amazon cart!

By now the Saw story--whether it's the original, the second or third--should be familiar enough: Jigsaw wants you to appreciate life more. So to get you to do so, he tests you. He wants to play a game....Get through the booby trap infested film and live. Fail, then die. Make your choice.

Saw III wraps up some Saw I and Saw II loose ends while seemingly taking us through the perils of Jigsaw's final test subject....Or should I say subjects? And is this the final Saw? Not bloody likely.

The first ingredient for a good sequel is when the same writers and directors that did the original return. And they did that in spades for Saw III.

Leigh Whannell co-wrote and appeared (as Adam) in all 3. James Wan directed and co-wrote 1, co-produced 2, and co-wrote and produced 3. Darren Lynn Bousman co-wrote and directed 2 and 3. You get the point...all the main creators are still hanging in there.  So ""check"" for the first ingredient.

The second key ingredient is getting all of the key actors back. Check again.

Another key ingredient is getting the sequels out relatively close; since 2004 the Saw films have been released in consecutive years. Checkaroo.

As for another sequel??? Saw IV is scheduled for this year to keep that consistency going, but Wan and Whannell seem to be the only main guys attaching their names to IV as of today. David Hackl who did some secondary work on 2 & 3 is rumored to be the director.

Plus with some key characters seemingly out for any more sequels, the Saw franchise after III looks to perhaps be headed down Friday the 13th Sequel Overkill Road.

Regardless, the first three in the series are good...for the genre. But, oh so much torture and gore! Especially in Saw III. Still sane after witnessing all the carnage in just Saw III? Imagine the mind warping of watching all 3 in one weekend. Might want to keep your distance from me...er, uh, I mean...anyone that calls that a fun 6 hours.",1171238400,2,2244,4.713554987212277

This should have won an oscar, yeah I said it. What would you rather watch Brokeback Mountain or the inner workings of Jigsaw before he has brain surgery. This edition keeps the body count low, but the severity of the torture is the highest to date. One poor guy gets the Theisman treatment on not one but 5 parts of his body. Somewhere in D.C. Theisman is watching this and peeing himself. Jigsaw is a unique cat, he is up to his tricks with his lovely assistant Shawnee Smith as well. Lots of great scenes explaining more about the first 2 epic films. I thought this film had some of the rudest scenes in a long time, so its not for everyone.

1561287,3,B00005JPBL,"This one gets 3 star from me, simply because it helped tie up a lot of loose ends from Saw 1& 2.

I would have to say, I agree with several of the other reviews that point out, this film isn't a ""true"" horror film, but rather a suspenceful storyline.

On the other hand, I'd have to disagree with those that gave this film a poor rating, based on the fact that they couldn't understand how the torture gadgets were created or how the victims were abducted in the first place.

If one is to question these facts in this film, the same would have to be applied to all 3 installments, since they all tip the scale of believability to varying degrees.

As I have said before, while giving a review for other items (books, cd's and dvd's alike), I think we are too quick to point out the shortfalls of others, rather than giving credit where credit is due.

Granted, this isn't the best film I've ever seen....by a long shot.  But when I think of the many other totally horrible movies I've seen in the past, I'd have to say, it's definitely not the worst, either.

Not a film I would go out of my way to recommend, but would encourage those who were intrigued by the first two, to finish out the ride while doing as many others and myself are doing............praying this is the end of the line for this story (although as someone else has already said...""I doubt it."")",1170633600,,1366,4.333333333333333

Film makers in this country have lost sight as to what constitutes horror. We are far behind the rest of the world where this film concept is concerned.

This garbage is made for one reason only; kids shell up money and think this is entertainment. This film is boring, dull, gruesome, cruel and extremely depressing. When I was younger I remember leaving theaters after some of the great horror movies of the day laughing from the good fright experience those movies provided. This is not the case anymore. Blood, blood, blood and more blood combined with the sickest ways imaginable to torture and kill people is NOT entertainment, it is NOT horror. It is trash.

The first Saw was...eh...ok. The second was purely stupid. The third one is pure garbage. Thankfully I haven't had to shell over one red cent to see any of these pieces of junk. But three is my limit. I will not subject myself to parts 4, 5, 6 and however many they will make to sucker the movie going public in the future. This is what you get when you have no standards and no expectations.

1561289,3,B00005JPBL,"The original ""Saw"" was everything a horror film should be.  It had gore both implied and explicit, twists and turns in the plot, and characters that the audience didn't particularly want to see die.  Then came along Saw II, which ramped up the gore factor considerably, and while it had its moments, it was obviously only there to make money off of the success of the original.  Now the horror genre has been graced with the third offering in the series, which is firmly in Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street territory.  The series is now officially a parody of itself, and its continued existence is only assured as long as it remains a cash cow (which it will).

The main problem with Saw III is that Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are no longer believable villains.  They exude no sense of terror or aura of fear, as they are creatures that simply could not exist in reality.  Jigsaw has essentially become the God of the universe.  He knows every minute detail of every person's life.  He knows where everyone sleeps, how they take their coffee, how long it takes them to drive to work, when the best time to break into their house to plant cameras would be, how their relationships with their spouses and children are, what color underwear they buy, etc.  Both Jigsaw and Amanda are also expert locksmiths, pharmacists, and engineers.  With no funds at all, they can craft any torture device of any size in minimal time.  These devices are also so expertly crafted that they can be deactivated and removed with one small padlock, even if the device is fully covering a person's entire body.  These villains are no longer scary because there is obviously no hope of survival at all.  No matter how physically strong or prepared a person is, they cannot avoid being captured by Jigsaw, and they have no chance of escaping his traps alive.

Jigsaw is portrayed as a sort of avenging angel in this movie.  Out of all the characters, he is the most rational and detached from emotion.  The overall tone of the movie almost implies that he is correct and that everyone should just submit to his will and change their lives according to his system of beliefs.  The problem with this logic is that if Jigsaw's beliefs are applied to his own life, he should be the one stuck in a deadly trap.  His whole point in capturing and torturing people is to show them that they have been wasting their lives and they need to start living and being happy with their lot.  He states that one character was chosen because she spends her life doing nothing but trying to save the dead, while her family life is dying.  However, this exact same sentence could be applied to Jigsaw.  He spends his life trying to save others from emotional death, and this obsession has obviously killed him inside.

Even with all these problems, Saw III does have some merit.  The gore in this entry of the series is simply out of control, and exceedingly well done.  The tone of the gore has become even more sadistic than in Saw II.  An early scene involving chains that have been run through a man's flesh, including his jaw, is absolutely stunning.  Pretty much everyone will cringe or look away when he starts ripping the chains out of himself.  The final major trap, dubbed ""the rack"", is one of the most diabolical devices put on film in recent memory.  The script is also better than anticipated, and it neatly brings the series full circle, connecting several events that didn't appear to be connected before.

The parallels between Friday the 13th and Saw are occurring with increasing frequency.  Jigsaw and Jason both kill in retribution for people not agreeing with their view of how the world should work.  While Jason punishes those who do drugs or have pre-marital sex, Jigsaw punishes those who have squandered their lives.  Both are unstoppable, invincible whirlwinds of death who can sneak up on anyone, no matter how implausible the situation.  Like every Friday the 13th movie ever made, even though the ending of Saw III completely ruined any option for a sequel, Saw 4 is currently in production.  Obviously Jason, I mean Jigsaw, will rise again to continue torturing those who don't agree with his world view.

1561292,5,B00005JPBL,"With Jigsaw debilitated and near death, it falls to his new protege to carry on the infamous 'games' in ""Saw III"", the most recent entry in one of the 2000s's best ongoing series.  Knowing nothing of any apprentice, the detectives who've been pursuing the Jigsaw killer since the first chapter in the series are mystified by the continuing killings.

  ""Saw III"" ties elements from its two predecessors in with new ideas and a new direction expertly, creating a movie that enhances both of the films that came before it (which were already excellent).  The ongoing story has become deeper and more multi-faceted while losing nothing of the horror and tension that initially catapulted the concept to greatness.  The new protege abducts a doctor whose own life now depends on her ability to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to see the outcome of the latest, most complex - and most psychologically interesting - of the deathtrap-oriented games.  The character of Jigsaw is explored more deeply in this one - for the first time it feels like his rationale of 'teaching the value of being alive' by bringing the victims who survive so close to death, may actually be something more than a contrived excuse for a psychopath to reign in terror and pain.  For the first time the character, despite the depravity of his actions throughout the series, comes off as being possibly something other than nothing but plain evil, comes off as a twisted but mentally complex individual who may somehow believe his own words, and that his games - in his own warped psyche - have more to them than gratuitous sadism.  He even appears capable of sympathizing with his victims.  This is not a plot roundabout to just take a villain who became immensely popular and 'turn him good', it's part of an an ongoing evolution of what's being revealed about the characters (as of this entry there are now a fair number who have appeared in two or more of the movies).  The characterization of Jigsaw's apprentice is also very developed here, but harder to reference directly without risking spoilers; and the doctor - who despite her dangerous situation seems consumed more by a desire to save her patient regardless of who or what he is - is an excellent addition to the roster of players.  And as for the infamous games themselves, nothing of the shock, nothing of the savagery, nothing of the intensity has been sacrificed to make room for expanded insight into the characters.  Indeed, the twists and revelations - and questions - spinning out of this latest round of the games may be the most gripping of the trilogy.

1561294,5,B00005JPBL,"Best of the three.  Yes, there is more gore.  Yes, there are even more new and inventive ways that people get tortured and killed.  But for me, that was not what created the suspense in the film, it was the story of Jigsaw, Amanda and Lynn.  Amanda is an especially interesting character.  I had not seen the other two movies in a while so the ""flashbacks"" were helpful., especially to help flesh out her roles in all of this madness.

I think this movie is the most intelligent of the three.  I liked the sort of ""twist upon twist"" added to the end.  Although I hope this is the last installment of the Saw franchise, I am sure money-hungry Hollywood is already planning another.  Here we have Jigsaw, who has appointed himself ""God"", on his deathbed playing more of his gory games.  When he says he despises murderers, it's a big fat clue for the story, but has his brain cancer made him so deranged he actually believes that lie?  By trying to take him from a crazy, twisted, psycho killer into a killer with a cause, or a ""message"" it weakens the story even more than it did in Saw 2.  The story almost tries to make him a little too warm and fuzzy, and I am just not buying that!  The movie, especially the ending, is no less breath-taking for it though.

Top-notch acting from the entire cast.  Original story.  Inventive horror scenes make this a great gory horror movie.  There are no scares or jump scenes here though, just full frontal goriness.  If you're squeamish, you should probably pass.  My husband had a hard time stomaching it and actually questioned my sanity for watching this type of gore.

The most disturbing scene is not one of Jigsaw's many games, though---it's the operation performed on his brain to remove a piece of his skull to prevent him from dying.  It's pretty gruesome to say the least.

As for the movie itself, the writers seem to be trying to turn Jigsaw into some kind of mercy-seeking angel, trying to somehow justify his horrifying acts.  Sorry, folks...Jigsaw is pure evil, sociopathically immoral, and immune to the immense acts of torture he orchestrates with the assistance of his demented slave, well played by Shawnee Smith.  Tobin Bell is effective as Jigsaw, considering most of his time is spent in a hospital bed.  There are some horrifying acts of sadistic torture, and some good acting from Angus Macfayden as the man whose revenge leads him down a fatal path.  Bahar Soomekh is also effective as the doctor recruited to perform the operation on Jigsaw, or die herself.  Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyers return from SAW II, but they are merely torture objects in this one.

SAW has had its moments, but the trilogy should stop now; it's focusing more on gore and shock than storylines, and even though you wouldn't think so, it does leave a door open for another sequel.  Do us a favor...stop while you're reasonably ahead.",1170288000,,1378,4.85042735042735

1561436,5,B00005JPBL,"This flick was my favorite in the trilogy.
Hands down the goriest of the three.
Twice the amount of medieval torture devices
Twice the drama & Twice the tension
It almost seems like this one aims to gross you out,
even the devices are cruder and more brutal this time around
From a rack that twists limbs
to a shotgun necklace
to the ultimate piercing
They all deliver the goods

If you've seen the previous two installments,
you know what you're getting into
If you haven't, they're required,
because this sequel plays off the other two,
adding previously unknown elements to the back-story via flashbacks

The ending was a little too much though
It didn't fit with the way Jigsaw operates
I don't want to ruin it for you, so i won't say more

Just a little side-note:
My personal favorite part involved brain surgey and a power drill
(Figured I'd add that)

I must admit Saw III has many gross bloody moments with great torture devices but it was so rushed to get to the end that they forgot to let us get to know any of the characters.  These movies have made enough money to get some better known actors haven't they?  Perhaps familiar faces would help the audience connect to the characters more.  Or better writing too.  In Saw III we get what is expected.  More games, more sick twisted scenes, and we also get a surprise at the end of the movie that for me was worth giving the film four stars.

Amanda stated she built the shotgun bullet trap - yeah, sure.  Everything seems to work out perfectly and timed.  The husband must have a very low IQ as he is so slow to save any of the victims, by the time he does anything, they are dead, often standing there like an idiot for some time.  His wife is dying on the floor and he takes his sweet time to do anything.  Why couldn't she warn him that killing Jigsaw would result in her death?

Come on. And how do they know all the backgrounds of the victims you have to be some FBI or stock people all day long 24/7 to figure out their backgrounds. Some i'm assuming Jigsaw doesn't have a job because he's to busy following and stocking his victims. And how the hell can Jigsaw or the chick design all the elaborate death traps. Give me a freakin break. You have to be an engineer to design all the traps. Even if you could,  where are you going to get all the parts. And how did the chick kidnap the doctor in the hospital??? There's camera surveillance in all hospitals 24/7. These Saw movies are so stupid. More stupid then Freddy or Jason or Michael Myers coming back to life 100 times. At least Freddy, Jason, and Michael Myers are portrayed as supernatural demons or zombies that can't be killed. Saw movies try to make it seem this can happen in real life.

1561573,3,B00005JPBL,"I, probably like most people, think the Saw franchise has gotten less and less a horror/psychological movie and more into just gore. Part of the beauty of the first Saw was that there wasn't a ton of gore, it left more to the imagination, thus concentrating on the central characters. Saw II was where the gore became seemingly more important than the actual story. I won't deny, hearing that II would welcome blood and guts with arms open excited me. And while it was good, there were far more things that agrivated me than pleased me. First, I didn't care about ANY character. Second, Donnie Wahlberg.

Saw III is where I'll most likely leave the franchise. They barely focus on the characters or their back stories for why Jigsaw wanted them. Instead they seem to concentrate on making the contraptions more intricate, bloodier deaths, and more cussing. So yeah, they definitely succeed on those fronts. The cussing is over-zealous. F-bombs are dropped like nobody's business and for no reason at all. The deaths are surely cringe-worthy, I found myself looking away at certain points (I know I know). And the contraptions are eerily complex. 'The Rack', yeah, that's the most sadistic thing I've ever seen.

The one plus, character-wise, has been the biggest plus from the very beginning, Jigsaw himself. His reasoning behind things, especially this time around, are things you'd never think of, even while he's dropping some huge hints through the entire movie. Once he provides answer though, everything clicks, everything that didn't make sense in the beginning makes perfect sense afterward.

In conclusion, if you don't mind the sacrifice of character developement for some insane deaths, Saw III is right up your alley. For those of us who want to actually care about who dies and who doesn't, Saw III is a big letdown. Give and take, and as always, it's your preference against mine.

I'm not sure the skull operation scene close ups were entirely needed, but hey...Plus these movies give you some interesting ideas to think about in terms of 'what have I really done with my life? what kind of person would Jigsaw say I am?'. I give these movies points for this, because at least they're trying to get you to think, even if it's on a semi-surface level, and often lost in a sea of blood and shredded pig corpses.",1169769600,2,860,4.6644736842105265

I watched this movie with an Playstation 3 that plays blu-ray

Now, I seen all Saw movies.. I would like to say this movie has more gore than the first and second ones... It alot of disturbing images going on in this film, a lot of strange stories and flashbacks.  If u like Saw 1 and 2.. then you would love this one far better.

1561576,3,B00005JPBL,"I'm not even going to bother going over a synopsis of the plot. All you horror fans need to know is that this movie surpasses the first film, but in my opinion, it doesn't stand up to the second film in terms of suspense. Saw 3 is the goriest, most disturbing of the films. It seems like 2006 was the year of gore! First came Hostel, with it's torture and blood, then came The Hills Have Eyes, with it's rape, animal killings, parent killings and brutality, and now comes Saw 3...With it's flesh tearing, bone breaking, head twisting, gore splattered shock-fest. I have NEVER, in all my years of watching horror, had to actually cover my own ears and close my eyes while watching more than one scene in a movie before this one. The opening scene had me squirming in my seat with my lids tightly shut (after 15 seconds into the scene I had to mute the tv because I was so grossed out by the noises) and the scene involving a victim trapped in a device that ""TWISTS"" every limb on his body until the skin tears and the bones break made me want to literally vomit. But, still, the movie was very suspensful and horrifying. It kept you watching and interested. If you can stomach extreme gore and terror then you might enjoy this film. I have to admit that I REALLY hated the ending though. I can't even explain how upset it made me, but overall, the movie was very scary and disturbing. Better than the first, not as good as the second...give it a try...but do it on an empty stomach!!",1169683200,14,1482,4.353790613718411
1561577,5,B00005JPBL,"Since the first ""Saw"" came out, a highly low-budget film mostly panned by critics which has become surprisingly successful, the sequels have taken the idea and managed to make it if not any deeper or more complex plot-wise, they were certainly more enjoyable.  It's especially entertaining to see in Saw II as Donnie Wahlberg's character is driven nuts just talking to Jigsaw, who promises his son's ""safe"" delivery if he just stays and talks (note: safe not put in quotes because its untrue, it's just a spoiler)

****SPOILERS ALERT****

Saw III starts out with a much denied rumor proven true of Donnie Wahlberg returning as the cop from Saw II.  He is placed in the same bathroom as Adam and Lawrence were in the first, but rather than saw his foot off, he does somethng more gruesome (bashing his foot so it can slide through the cuff) and then goes after Amanda who is still in the catacombs.  He nearly succeeds in killing her, but she eventually prevails.

Then we move on with the usual someone caught in Jigsaw's trap, and showing more people caught in his traps.  But there's something different about these ones... no one is surviving the traps, and while some of them are particularly impossible (try removing a metal ring that is connected to your jaw, beneath your tongue and behind your chin), even if the person somehow managed to survive it, their traps do not let them go.

Before the main victims are introduced, the sole recurring character (save for Jigsaw and Amanda) from the franchise (played by Dina Meyer) discovers that Jigsaw's traps have become inescapable, and the slaughter is becoming more brutal without any particular justification.  As she makes this revelation, she is now caught in one of Jigsaw's traps, and would have escaped, but her contraption failed to open with the key she retrieved in a cup of acid, and she dies.

Now we are introduced to the characters.  I have mixed feelings about them as I love Angus Macfeyden as an actor, and he certainly brings his character as much to life as he can, while the woman playing his wife (Lynn) seems quite bored in the beginning where she's shown going to work after having an affair.  Macfayden's character (Jeff) is perpetually tormented by the death of his son in a car accident, and the person involved has been let off and so his life falls apart as he devotes himself to tracking the people down and--probably--killing him.

Quickly, the two are captured by Jigsaw's new assistant, Amanda, and placed in their respective traps.  Lynn, being the doctor, is fixed with a neck-contraption with shotgun shells which will ignite and kill her if a now-bedridden Jigsaw dies, and she is responsible for keeping him alive.

Jeff, meanwhile, is placed in a gauntlet of a different kind of torture.  Rather than suffer physically, he is made to suffer mentally as Jigsaw's gauntlet leads him to rooms where other people are placed in brutal traps.  Each person has a tape with them, which is addressed to Jeff, and told how each person was partly responsible for either his son's death or the mistrial resulting in his killer's escape from justice.  Jigsaw's test is to see if he can forgive them for their actions or inactions and help them to escape the traps.

The first is a woman who was jogging that morning that Jeff's son was hit, and refused to testify in court.  She is stripped naked and chained by her hands in the middle of a freezer, while a machine sprays her with misty water every few minutes, intending to freeze her.  Jeff is reluctant to free her at first, but soon overcomes this and attempts to retrieve the key to let her go (resulting in a nasty flesh wound on his cheek) but by the time he gets it, she is completely frozen over, and the lock as well.

The next room he goes into he must free the judge who dismissed the case due to lack of evidence.  He is strapped by the neck at the bottom of a pit while a machine takes pig carcasses and drops them in a grinder, shooting the liquified pigs into the pit to slowly drown him.  Jeff must get the key to shut the machine off by burning his son's stuffed animals which Jeff kept to himself obsessively after his son's death.  He gets it in time to save the man, and they move on.

Meanwhile, while Lynn is caring for Jigsaw, we get some insight not only into Jigsaw and his past, but also insight into Amanda, and how her apparent Stockholm Syndrome with Jigsaw evolved into a full-on obsession, so much so that she begins to grow insanely jealous with Lynn, whom Jigsaw is treating benevolently, while scolding Amanda for lashing out emotionally.  She relieves the pain by cutting her thighs.

There are also some very nice and insightful flashbacks, showing that Amanda's assistance of Jigsaw has extended as far back as Dr Gordon and Adam in the first movie.  We see her preparing Jigsaw for his stint in the room, taking a drug to slow his breathing and heartbeat (so he can appear a corpse) while also placing Adam in the cold bath and setting up everything.  We even see her coming in after Jigsaw has left Adam in the bathroom, and see her reviving a still-alive Adam and then murdering him (by wrapping a plastic bag around his head), and the rush she gets from killing him.

We also get to see flashbacks showing Amanda developing an almost daughterly obsession with Jigsaw, and her growing taste for murder.  We find out she is the one responsible for making Jigsaw's traps unwinnable, and Jigsaw is not oblivious to this.

Back with Jeff and the judge, they come into the final room, where the man who killed Jeff's son is placed in a crucifix-style trap.  It slowly begins to twist his limbs one by one in 360 circles, and the key to unlock the man from the device is hanging inside a glass tube connected to the trigger of a shotgun.  Jeff is obviously hesitant, but with the pressure of the judge, he decides to help him, but is having trouble trying to get the key without setting off the shotgun.  We are led to believe that the shotgun is empty and that this is merely a test of Jeff's willingness to shed some of his own blood to save another.  Still, he yanks the key and jerks away, just as the shotgun fires off and accidentally hits the judge who is standing off behind him.  Jeff attempts to use the key to free the man in the trap, but the key does not fit (Amanda's doing) and he is killed with the crucifix twists his head completely around, and Jeff is left alone now.

Jeff finds his way to Jigsaw's workshop somehow, and Amanda grows further infuriated with Lynn.  She then pulls out her gun and shoots Lynn, only to then be shot by Jeff who has found a gun nearby.  Jigsaw then reveals to Amanda that he has been testing her as well, and that she has failed.  Now that they are confronted, Jigsaw challenges Jeff with his last test---to forgive Jigsaw, for putting him and his wife in this situation.  Jeff says he forgives him---then retrieves a buzz saw and slits Jigsaw's throat.  As he starts to bleed to death, he unveils a tape recorder in his hand, and plays a pre-recorded message for Jeff in the event of Jigsaw's death.  He tells Jeff of what will happen, that he has failed, and that now he can never save his child---as Jeff had been told in Jigsaw's first tape that he would save his child, thinking it to be his son by getting justice for his death, when he never realized that Jigsaw had also kidnapped his daughter and placed her in a secret place.

As Jigsaw flatlines, Lynn's neck contraption goes off and kills her, and Jeff is left to wail loudly in pain as his wife is dead, his daughter missing, and the exits to the hideout are closed shut by automatic metal doors, effectively trapping him inside.

All in all, there was a lot more attempts at a philosophy in Jigsaw's torturous tests, and a lot of deeper insight into the minds of Amanda and Jigsaw, as well as a strong theme of forgiveness.  Along with this, it is also much much gorier than the previous two, but nothing that is both gross and traumatic (like live amputations and such).  One of my favorite gory scenes was the emergency brain surgery performed by Lynn on Jigsaw using power tools and stolen medical equipment :P

While not something deep and thrilling, it was an enjoyable ride, and I strongly oppose the studios' decision to call for a Saw IV.  It is over.  Jigsaw is dead, Amanda is dead, Kerry is dead, Detective Matthews is dead, Doctor Gordon is dead, Adam is dead, Lynn is dead, Jeff is dead, there's no one to go on other than lame copycats which we would rather not see.",1169683200,,8560,4.528914879792072
1561578,5,B00005JPBL,"The third installment of the Saw chronicles was much better than the second which I thought got a bit cheesy at the end.  The third movie was extremely gory (if you don't like blood and guts I don't recommend watching it), had a good plot, lots of action and on the edge nail biting intensity.

Jigsaw is on his deathbed and has his crazy assistant, Amanda, kidnap a doctor to help him with his illness but of course in Jigsaw fashion, there is a catch.  He also has her kidnap a man whose child had been accidentally run over by a driver and the driver was let off with a short sentence, which the father believes was not long enough for the crime.  The father has been living in a state of revenge and Jigsaw gives him the opportunity to fulfill his fantasies.  All of the characters weave together perfectly and at the end of the movie, all is explained.  The end of the movie is a perfect lead into the next sequel.  There are lots of twists and turns with the plot but all are believable.  If you like these kinds of gore movies, I highly recommend it.",1169683200,2,1057,4.276381909547739
1561579,4,B00005JPBL,"Jigsaw is back, and he's got a nubile babe for an apprentice, the kind that'd make my nethers tingle if it wasn't for the fact she's a real sick twist.  Based on a screenplay by Leigh Whannell (Saw, Saw II), Saw III was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II), and features Tobin Bell (Mississippi Burning, The Quick and the Dead) reprising his role as Jigsaw, the methodical master of malicious mayhem.  Also appearing is Shawnee Smith (The Blob), Angus Macfadyen (Cradle Will Rock), Bahar Soomekh (Crash), Donnie `Donnie D' Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher), Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers), and 1980s B movie favorite Betsy Russell (Private School, Tomboy), whose fianc Mark Burg happened to be one of the numerous producers on the film, in a minor role.

The third installment picks up where the last one left off as we see detective Eric Matthews (Wahlberg) in a familiar situation (familiar, at least, to someone who's seen the previous films), in a dank, grimy, dimly lit room, his leg shackled to a pipe, a rusty hacksaw within reach.  What follows is pretty wild (and messy), as Eric manages an escape, but not the way you might expect.  After this there's some bits with Eric's colleague Detective Kerry (Meyer), to which we move along into the story proper as we meet an attractive ER doctor named Lynn (Soomekh), whose life seems fraught with misery and despair, despite the appearance of having it all.  Anyway, after she's kidnapped by a figure donning a hog head, she finds herself in the Guru of Gristle's lair, a large, funky looking warehouse with intermittent lighting, filled to the brim with all kinds of wicked looking devices.  Lynn soon learns the reason behind her abduction as she meets the sickly Jigsaw (if you recall he was extremely ill in the previous film), along with his attractive assistant, the reason being to keep Jigsaw alive, with the cost of failure being her own life.  Seems Jiggy's got a game going, one he wants to be around for to see all the way through.  After this we meet the primary player in Jigsaw's most current game, a pathetic sack named Jeff (Macfadyen), as he's put through a series of tests, all of which involve other individuals suffering greatly, with Jeff having the ability to save them (for the whys and what nots you'll have to watch the film).  As Jeff progresses through Jigsaw's diabolical maze of gory madness, Lynn finds herself having to perform a little brain salad surgery, all while Jigsaw's assistant, who's a few clowns short of a circus, descends deeper into her own, personal pit of psychosis.  After a ton of flashbacks and some pretty horrific deaths, things eventually come full circle resulting in some memorable revelations.

While I thought this third entry into the series entertaining, I think it is important to mention the importance of seeing the previous films prior to watching this one as there's a lot of references tied to what occurred previous i.e. this is not a stand alone sequel, as may be the case with other franchise features.  Now you could watch this film and follow along somewhat without having seen the previous entries, but you'll appreciate the complexities of the overall story all the more having all the pieces of the puzzle.  I did enjoy the concerted efforts to directly relate this to the previous films, but I thought the flashbacks to be excessive at times, especially the ones that filled in gaps that weren't necessarily vital in the overall scheme of things (Was anyone particularly enlightened by learning Jigsaw had help in setting up Dr. Gordon in the first film?).  Another aspect I didn't care for occurs near the end, after an important revelation...once revealed the filmmakers go through an extensive series short flashbacks perhaps to reinforce the impact, but it seemed more an effort to spoon feed the audience the all the bits that led up to said revelation, as if we weren't all that bright to get it in the first place.  I was paying attention so the events tied to the revelation weren't lost on me, and I felt it unnecessary to rehash the material.  Another bit that annoyed me slightly was the lighting in Jigsaw's lair...I thought it odd how many lighting fixtures worked on a sporadic basis, flashing on and off.  I know this was done to help create an atmosphere, but it became a little irritating after awhile.  The traps featured here were pretty wild (and vicious), and the gore factor high.  There are some real nasty devices throughout, the worst, in my opinion, being the rack, which Jigsaw claimed his personal favorite (the shotgun shell collar was a trip, as was the hideous hog-o-matic processor).  I won't reveal any more about it, but know it provides for a whole lot of intense, lingering pain before delivering death.  There are a few twists near the end, one of which, involving Lynn, I thought particularly well done, especially given the fact Jigsaw provided a good deal of clues prior to the revelation.  These clues seem innocuous statements initially, but once fully understood, they provide a respectable punch to the gut.  The performances were suitable, the story thoughtful and generally well crafted (there are a few holes and elements that require a good deal of suspension of disbelief), the atmosphere suitably grimy and ookie, and the pacing reasonable.  The story was complicated, but I thought Bousman, along with his editor, did a good job in keeping things orderly, ultimately paving the way for another sequel.

This unrated DVD version (which runs 113 minutes compared to the 107 minute theatrical runtime), released by Lions Gate, features a sharp looking, widescreen anamorphic (1.78:1) picture, along with a vibrant audio track, available in both 5.1 and 2.0 Dolby Digital for English and Spanish.  There's a healthy assortment of extras including three featurettes, the first titled The Traps of Saw III, another titled The Details of Death: The Props of Saw III, and a third called Darren's Diary: Anatomy of a Director.  Also included are three commentary tracks, one featuring director Darren Lynn Bousman, writer/executive producer Leigh Whannell, and producers Oren Koules and Mark Burg, a second featuring executive producers Peter Block and Jason Constantine, and a third with director Darren Lynn Bousman, editor Kevin Greutert, and director of photography David A. Armstrong.  On top of that are deleted scenes, subtitles in English and Spanish, a theatrical trailer, a theatrical teaser, and trailers for Crank (2006), Saw Special Edition DVD, Saw II Special Edition DVD, The Punisher Extended Cut DVD, The Invincible Iron Man (2007) animated feature, and Hostel II (2007).  If you really thrive on extras, this is a decent edition to get, but you might want to wait and see if Lion's Gate, a company that seems to specialize in double dipping, is going to eventually release a two DVD special edition of the film, as they did with the previous Saw movies.

1561709,4,B00005JPBL,"Horror franchises aren't known for maintaining the energy and excitement of the first films in the respective series. I really enjoyed the first Saw - while it does have its flaws, I still think it was a refreshing film in comparison to the other horror movies that were coming out at the time. With that said, if you didn't enjoy the first Saw, you're not going to enjoy Saw 3 so don't bother.

Saw 3 picks up immediately after Saw II and while it is a horror movie so we're not talking about The Brothers Karamazov in terms of plot and character development, the viewer will enjoy Saw 3 more if the two previous films have been seen.

Ultimately it seems that the Saw movies come down to the traps and the twist ending. It seemed like the second Saw was all traps and the twist ending wasn't that surprising (some would say a cliche). Saw 3 has some very good traps but there's also some that seem unrealistic or shot poorly. Overall, they were okay - some definite moments that will stay with you but others that were just silly. As for the twist ending, I didn't get on board. It just seemed like the producers were so desperate to outdo themselves that they brainstormed all the possible twists they could come up with and threw them all in.

But even with those criticisms, I still had a good time with the film. I think it fits well into the series and while neither Saw 2 or 3 have matched the first film, they both stand up as welcome additions.",1169596800,5,1454,4.357933579335794

We see Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) slamming the door on a well and truly trapped Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg).  ""Game's over"", she mutters as she leaves.  But is the game over for Matthews?  It is for one other part II carryover; Kerry (Dina Meyer).  She is investigating the death of a former ex-con who has died in a most brutal manner.  At first, she doesn't expect Jigsaw was involved, but she soon learns otherwise as the video retrieved from the crime scene shows.

Soon, Kerry is abducted by Amanda and she meets the same gruesome demise as the crime scene victims she used to investigate.  But the real story follows .

There are two story lines in this movie.  One deals with Jigsaw's worsening brain tumor.  Realizing his condition is deterorating, he instructs Amanda to abduct Lynn (Bakar Soomekh), a successful surgeon, to help with his condition.  Upset with her life situation, Lynn is apparently just going through the motions at her job.  Amanda abducts her and leads her to Jigsaw, where she is fitted with an explosive collar designed to detonate if Jigsaw ""flatlines"".  She is forced to keep Jigsaw alive or risk her own death.

The other plot deals with a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen).  Jeff's young son was killed by a drunk driver, and he has been dealing with feelings of revenge.  Captured by Jigsaw and placed in a box, he is released and able to confront those responsible for the death of his son; the lone eyewitness, the leniant judge, and the driver himself.  He has the choice of saving each of these people or letting them die.  Will Jeff choose life or death?  Will he be able to overcome his feelings of rage and save these people, or will they die like so many other of Jigsaw's victims?

The best part of the movie is the final 15 minutes.  In this time, all of the questions and twists of the movie are neatly wrapped up.  Watch closely so you don't miss anything.

I found this movie to be the best of the ""Saw"" movies by far.  Tobin Bell does a magnificent job as the maniachal Jigsaw, and the other actors are very good as well.  What sets this movie apart from the first two is its excellent plot.  It will keep you guessing throughout until everything is revealed at the end.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The ""Saw"" series has become one of the biggest horror movie series in recent memory, and this thrilling and bloody installment maintains the earlier tradition.  The scenes in this movie are much more graphic than in the first two movies, so watch with caution.  This series has become one of my favorites, and ""Saw III"" keeps the action and blood flowing.",1169596800,3,2807,4.630831643002028

1561715,4,B00005JPBL,"`Saw III' directed by Darren Lynn Bousman is cut from the same cookie cutter script as the previous two movies, without the novelty of the first, but with just a scant improvement in plot over the second. The `Saw' series is the exemplar for an entire new genre of horror movie which can to some extent trace its roots back to `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. While these have been criticized as being nothing more than exercizes in blood and Sadism, I really find them big improvements over the very tired plotlines arrising out of the Halloween model which has been done to death a at least 13 times over and more. The basic premise replaces the nave teenager oblivious to the danger lurking behind him, with a fully aware victim in imminant peril that they fully appreciate, and which is drawn out with building expectation rather than diving in with a quick kill. Thus, in spite of all the gore and paraphenalia, there is much more psychological terror and vicarious fear being dished out here than by most appearences by Freddy or Jason or whomever.

The other side of the coin is the realization of how bare these movies are of new ideas. The whole premise of the first movie was culled from a three minute scene from `The Road Warrior'. And that was the best of the three movies. One of the opening `trap' scenes in this movie was taken from a similarly short scene in the first `Hellraiser' movie. The voice-over commentary from the director and producers make great exclamation on how well things are executed in this movie, totally ignoring the fact that the story line is radically disconnected and the behavior of the characters is improbable at best.

There is much to the criticism of this sub-genre of horror movie, and the criticism would lead to believing that the films had no value whatsoever, except that nobody else is doing the `Perils of Pauline' sthick at all, let alone well. That said, I will say that the `traps', that is, `the good parts' in this movie, are just a bit better than `the good parts' in `Saw I' and `Saw II'.",1169596800,4,2048,4.608219178082192
1561716,3,B00005JPBL,"I'm not even going to consider recent films like Hostel, the Hills Have Eyes and Saw films ""horror"". It's more like a demented version of a slasher film. These films in essence rely on buckets of gore to scare their audience but therein lies the rub: it doesn't scare. Instead what it does is create a feeling of disgust, a ""eww!"" or a cringe rather than chill you to the bone and make you lose sleep. While I'll admit Saw was a pretty good film for what it was, on subsequent viewings it did fall apart and Saw II was just awful. Saw 3 is more in spirit to 1 but it's also filled with flaws from both.

A bit more ambitious in scope, we follow 2 threads: Lynn, a doctor, is taken in by Amanda and Jigsaw because Jigsaw's tumor is getting worse and he wants to be alive to see the end of his next game. In another thread, Jeff, haunted by the death of his son, is not being tortured but what's tested is his need for revenge: he meets people that are strapped into torture devices and he has to get them out. Of course, in the world of Saw, it's not that simple.

Be forewarned: this is definately the goriest film the series has seen. Does it work? Kind of. The victims are dispatched in unbelievably gruesome ways but rather than let your imagination take over, we see everything so nothing is left to wonder about. While it does make you cringe, especially one scene involving surgery, it doesn't really scare you to the point where you get goosebumps but rather you're hoping your dinner doesn't come up. Luckily the film has enough of other things to take your mind off it rather than just mindlessly putting in gore for the sake of it(I'm looking at you Hostel).

How's the story and everything else? It's actually better. While there is plotholes and inconsistencies and whatnot, it's also a bit more better written and being able to juggle various stories, including scenes that involve the first 2 flims are fun so this is much better than part 2. Will we get a more super-duper version later on? I don't see how. We have all the gore we need, 3 commentaries and featurettes so what else needs to be shown? Although to capitalize on the inevitable Saw IV, we'll probably get another.

I don't know if you'll want to buy it unless you love this stuff but give it a rent then make your decision then. Me? I liked it, far from loved but I wouldn't want to own it.",1169510400,5,2369,4.340857787810384
1561717,5,B00005JPBL,"I did not think that they could do better than Saw 2, so was I in for a pleasant surprise.

Everything has gotten better with saw, and this time they have truly outdone themselves. The plot is better, and there is more of everything than in 1 or 2.

More blood, more traps, more characters and storylines..just more of everything.

Also there seem to be a lot more twists and turns in this one.

Another thing I liked about it , is that it picked up right where Saw 2 left off, as Amanda in closing the door on the cop.

This movie is so good, and so full of surprises, that I can't say anymore or it will spoil it. I will only say that Jigsaw is still alive in this movie, not dead dead like I thought from Saw 2.

This would be very hard to top if they decide to make a Saw 4 !",1169510400,4,779,3.8987341772151898

1561854,4,B00005JPBL,"While the first film is still by far the best one, fans of the ""Saw"" films won't be disappointed with this latest (and last?) installment in this gore-filled series. ""Saw III"" more than lives up to the reputation of it's thrilling predecessors...and yes, there is of course a big twist at the end!

The movie picks up almost exactly where ""Saw II"" left off, and takes the story down a new path. At the end of the second movie we (the audience) discovered that Amanda, the girl from the first movie who managed to escape the giant bear-trap attached to her jaw, was being groomed by Jigsaw to carry on his legacy of teaching carefully selected people the importance of life by placing them in horrifying torture devices and forcing them to extremes in order to escape, or die. In ""Saw III"" Jigsaw is dying from a brain tumor, and engages in one final game with Amanda...

While I'm not usually a fan of films with mindless gore, I actually don't mind the ""Saw"" movies because they offer a nice heaping helping of thrills and twists to go along with it's usual blood bath. While I found myself shutting my eyes during most of the overly disgusting torture scenes (note to self...shutting your eyes does not shut out the sound effects...learn to shut ears as well) I was still able to enjoy this movie without having nightmares afterwards.

What would you do if you knew that in a matter of minutes you were going to die in a terrifyingly painful and grotesque way? Would you be willing to cut off your own foot with a saw? Would you be willing to stick your arm in a vat of acid that will immediately eat the flesh away from your bone? Would you be willing to cut the only key that can set you free out of the body of a live human being? These are the dilemmas Jigsaw's victims face. They face the very human fear of death, and are forced to contemplate their mortality in the two minutes they have left to live. Jigsaw attempts to instill in these people a greater appreciation for life, and he gives each of them the opportunity to save themselves...or perish. Our instinct to survive is one of the most primal components in human nature, and the ""Saw"" films ask the question, ""What would you be willing to do to survive""?

 While the lengths he goes to are psychopathic at best...is Jigsaw wrong in his ideology that people in the depths of despair in humanity need a helping hand to see the light? Generally this help comes from healthier practices, such as counseling, group therapy, or even simply having good support from a loved one. Torture probably isn't the best way to enlighten such individuals.

This 3rd installment is definitely the grossest out of all of them, so be warned that it might make even the toughest person squirm. Admittedly, I sort of guessed the twist at the end before it happened, but it turns out I was only partially right. Even if you think you know what the twist is...I promise you'll find out there's more to it than you think.

Bottom line, a great gross-out movie! I don't recommend watching it alone...",1169251200,11,3042,4.52
1561855,5,B00005JPBL,"Here is my take on not just SAW III but all of them. A man who is faced with the concept that he knows he is going to die, an average guy at that, makes a choice. He makes the choice to teach other people a lesson. A lesson about how valuable the gift of life is. So he sets some rules. He never truly sets out to kill anyone. That is the brilliance of the whole series. He puts you in a situation. One where you have to fight for the life you have ""wasted away"".

He chooses the drug users, rapists, voyeurs, pretty much the lowlifes of society who basically have chosen an ugly life and are just wasting away because it is what they chose. Jigsaw, in his amazing wisdom, asks you either you fight for a better life because of the one you had chosen, or die the way you will be remembered as, a rapist, drug user, murderer, and so on.

The challenge asks you to destroy some of your body but to learn a lesson. The lesson is:

""Why was I put here in the first place?""

Answer: Because of what you chose.

Now he makes you make the ultimate choice, fight to live, or just chose to die.

He wants you to win. He wants you to live. He wants you to realize that you are wasting away, so fix it.

A lot of people would view Jigsaw as a villain, probably one of the most intelligent in movies, not just a hacker and slasher, but in the heart of this, he can be considered a hero too. He wants you to change your life for the better, and avoid forever being condemned for the crimes and choices we all make. He knows someday he will die of something he has no control over. So if you don't have that burden, why push towards an early grave.

He is a hero.

That is what makes these movies amazing. The SAW series isn't your average hacker or slasher, it has deeper meanings.",1169251200,16,1768,4.057471264367816
1561856,4,B00005JPBL,"It's hard to believe, after watching this third installment in the uber-gory Saw series, that a fourth is in the making. This is not because the movies are running out of ideas (the twists, although expected, still have some creative bite to them) or because they are lacking a certain gruesome appeal (the films have a faithful fan base that has made the movies a Halloween tradition). Instead, it's because the makers of this third flick, by the last frame, appear to have painted themselves into a corner with a bucket of pig guts and brain juice.

But, if there's one thing the Saw movies have to teach us (and they go out of their way to pretend that they have a lot of teaching to do), it's that appearances can be deceiving. This lesson I believe. The rest of Saw's lecturing, well, it's hard to listen to a sermon when the pastor is ripping your arm off.

All of the usual suspects are back this time around, with Jigsaw (a pale-as-rainwater Tobin Bell) and his accomplice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), providing us with yet another meticulously macabre experiment in death and personal redemption. This time the primary subjects are Jeff (a man subsumed by grief for his son, Dylan, killed by a hit-and-run driver) and Lynn (an ER doctor who is addicted to pain killers and her own ennui). Jeff is given the opportunity, in a series of tests, to watch those responsible for his son's demise (a witness, a judge, the driver himself) meet their maker. Or, if he chooses the moral high ground, Jeff can save them. Lynn, meanwhile, has a much easier task: keep the dying Jigsaw alive long enough to watch this last game play out. If Jigsaw's heart stops beating, so does hers.

How Jeff and Lynn are connected is anyone's guess (and your first one will probably be right), but, as per usual, the film still has a few bloody aces up its sleeve. Shot in a line-up of primary colors (each scene has its own color schema) and grittily textured, it's the most visceral Saw, yet. Thankfully it doesn't trade (too much) of its brains for blood; just as the second film capitalized on elements of the first, this third covers the bases in all of them and -- if you watch close enough -- does, in fact, set up a few questions to be answered in a fourth.

Some might not be interested in questions like these, though. Although the franchise hasn't really lost its edge, it does appear to be losing steam. Each Saw is staged, in some way, as a morality play, with people trapped inside their own brand of sick salvation. The first movie was both inventive and focused. The second widened its aim and, as such, missed a few targets. This third film, with its ever-more-intricate web of wicked wisdom, almost collapses under its own weight. Here's hoping that the next Saw tries to cut out its Deeper Message with a chainsaw, instead of a finely-edged scalpel.",1169164800,,2847,4.587426326129666

1561978,5,B00005JPBL,"Not being an avid fan of the first Saw and disliking a lot the second one, I nevertheless was very surprised in a good way about the third installment. Yes, it's utterly relentless and gory, I saw people covering their eyes with hands in a theater, even I winced a couple of times although I had seen many of the films alike. But what I liked the most here was not the brutal nature of Saw III (and it's quite important for the fans when a movie lives up to its R-rating, so that they can say money was spent wisely) and not even the intricate story-line that keeps you surprised and on the edge of your seat all the time. Not the final twist which was expected of course but surely you didn't know what it would be exactly.

The main merit of the third part is that it doesn't appear to be a usual stupid sequel that lacks ideas, it brings some new sense into the series, glues all the three films together making a perfect trilogy out of it which now can be watched as a one big 5-hour film. There's plenty of flashbacks here that explain a lot from the second and even the first part, and some things become clear that were not in the ends of previous series. It really takes talent to make a movie that not just stands alone, but adds a lot to the other parts and completes them. Guys that were making it are true professionals and real maniacs :)

And apart from being as it seems overly gory and graphic Saw III can boast of being rather thoughtful too. The evil genius of Jigsaw (and of the makers of the film) made the characters (and us along with them) think about rage and its manifestations, about revenge and people's insatiable urge to punish those who took their beloved ones. By quite simple examples inclusive of flesh-ripping, bone-crushing, joint-wresting etc. the killer himself shows us killing is bad. Those will survive who don't succumb to the desire of payback. Only forgiving can grant forgiveness for ourselves. And that's the rule for everyone, even for the evil manipulator's apprentice, and it can't be broken. Otherwise death awaits you as well as your victims. In this movie Jigsaw is seen not as an ordinary killer maniac, but as some kind of a teacher if you will. So this time his puzzles must be solved not only using strength, keen wit and will to live, but also by testing your own virtue and that's something new for this kind of flicks, don't you agree?

I don't know what they will do with Saw IV, because the third part wrapped it all very nice making a perfectly neat structure of a trilogy. I'd leave it like that. You can top previous parts in respect of blood and guts, but it'll be pretty hard to keep the same level of thoughtfulness the third part established.",1165363200,27,2709,4.414

But what I liked the most here was not the brutal nature of Saw III (and it's quite important for the fans when a movie lives up to its R-rating, so that they can say money was spent wisely) and not even the intricate story-line that keeps you surprised and on the edge of your seat all the time. Not the final twist which was expected of course but surely you didn't know what it would be exactly.

The main merit of the third part is that it doesn't appear to be a usual stupid sequel that lacks ideas, it brings some new sense into the series, glues all the three films together making a perfect trilogy out of it which now can be watched as a one big 5-hour film. There's plenty of flashbacks here that explain a lot from the second and even the first part, and some things become clear that were not in the ends of previous series. It really takes talent to make a movie that not just stands alone, but adds a lot to the other parts and completes them. Guys that were making it are true professionals and real maniacs :)

And apart from being as it seems overly gory and graphic Saw III can boast of being rather thoughtful too. The evil genius of Jigsaw (and of the makers of the film) made the characters (and us along with them) think about rage and its manifestations, about revenge and people's insatiable urge to punish those who took their beloved ones. By quite simple examples inclusive of flesh-ripping, bone-crushing, joint-wresting etc. the killer himself shows us killing is bad. Those will survive who don't succumb to the desire of payback. Only forgiving can grant forgiveness for ourselves. And that's the rule for everyone, even for the evil manipulator's apprentice, and it can't be broken. Otherwise death awaits you as well as your victims. In this movie Jigsaw is seen not as an ordinary killer maniac, but as some kind of a teacher if you will. So this time his puzzles must be solved not only using strength, keen wit and will to live, but also by testing your own virtue and that's something new for this kind of flicks, don't you agree?

I don't know what they will do with Saw IV, because the third part wrapped it all very nice making a perfectly neat structure of a trilogy. I'd leave it like that. You can top previous parts in respect of blood and guts, but it'll be pretty hard to keep the same level of thoughtfulness the third part established.",1164758400,6,2709,4.414
1561983,5,B00005JPBL,"Having just finished watching this movie half an hour ago, I think I can say that Saw 3 could very well be the best horror movie of this year. As seen in the previous 2 movies, it's full of twists, turns, and reveals even more of the story of the first 2 movies without ever losing your attention. It even recalls small characters from the first movie and makes them the main characters! Particularly the girl who worked with Dr. Gordon from the first movie. We get more into her character, who goes by Dr. Lynn in the movie, finding out she has a destructive family consisting of a husband and a daughter. However, the reason they're so out of hand is because they've been emotionally scarred ever since their young son died from getting hit by a taxi driver. She is caught and Amanda (Jigsaw's apprentice) forces her to help Jigsaw's health problems because he has a severe brain tumor, all the while her husband, Jeff, is having to go through a ""maze"" to find out who killed his son.

However, as other reviewers have stated, the movie focuses more on Amanda than anyone else. Hey, like Jigsaw said, ""Your life is in the hands of Dr. Lynn."" It turns out, Jigsaw was never through testing her, ever since he saved her from her drug addiction. Unfortunately, she failed. Well, there's a LOT more than that in the movie, but I don't want to give too much away.

Saw 3 is easily my favorite movie of the series. The storyline is very interesting, the gore is top notch and very realistic, the torture devices are fascinating, it shows what big role Amanda actually has in all of Jigsaw's games, and there's even a level of emotion in it; mainly because we realize that only Amanda understood Jigsaw, and vice-versa. So if you're a fan of the Saw series, go to your local theater and watch it NOW. It's the best one in the series yet, and is my personal choice for best horror movie, and maybe movie, of the year.",1164499200,11,1911,4.4415954415954415

1561985,4,B00005JPBL,"There aren't many movies that can make me grimace and squirm in my seat. Only two movies have ever scared me, and I think that once, perhaps, I jumped a bit in my seat at a part where the rest of the theater gasped or screamed. This is one of those few movies that made me squirm. The gruesome - but not gratuitous - torture scenes are creative and original, and the ""special effects"", i.e., what they do to make us believe that a guy really is breaking his own foot to be able to get out of shackles is just brilliant.

The inclusion of Amanda's character, and her own private struggles, gives this installment of the Saw trilogy - in my opinion - a stronger story line. Not only are there the ""games"" we have come to enjoy and expect, there are two psychologically damaged characters (Jigsaw and Amanda) to watch interact and develop.

The plot is fairly straightforward, but we don't realize this until we get to the end. In essence, Jigsaw is dying and he recruits the help of a beautiful young doctor who just happens to be the best in her field. That's the first extension of disbelief the movie demands. The climax asks us to *really* suspend disbelief, as it could not have happened if it weren't for a remarkable coincidence of concurrent events. This didn't do too much to hurt the film, but it certainly would have been nicer to end on a stronger, tighter note.

This is forgivable, because the rest of the film was very logical and things happened in their appropriate sequence.

Meanwhile, Jeff (Macfayden) is going through a series of tests in which he faces the people responsible for his son's death and must forgive them.  After all, Jigsaw just wants people to appreciate life.

""Saw III"" lives up to its predecessors, and even manages to tie up some loose ends.  Flashing back to points in the first two films, the makers of this movie are able to make things fit a little more tightly.  Tobin Bell is good as the mastermind Jigsaw, and the rest of the cast is good enough as his pawns.

Before Saw 3 even came out... they were already saying 4 was greenlit. Please... there's no need for a part 4. It's just going to end up feeling more forced than 3 did!

Yeah, that's my main gripe - Saw 3 felt SO forced. I'm a fan of ""twist ending"" movies. The twist in this one is LAME! Extremely forced. And when the twist comes, the almighty flashbacks serve more as a plea to buy the story than an unveiling of an ingenious plot. It's like the flashbacks beg, ""See? This is why the twist is good.

1562157,2,B00005JPBL,"Now that the Halloween ritual is over, so is the only good reason to see ""Saw III"" at a theatre. So here are some observations for those reading these comments while trying to decide whether they should pay good money to see the movie.

First off look at the situation objectively, by its third installment the ""Saw"" franchise has become what the film industry refers to as a ""pre-sold"" product. This means that during the pre-production phase it was known that virtually anything released to theatres with the title ""Saw III"" will do substantial business. For those (including myself) who enjoyed the first two, it would be a much-anticipated Halloween ritual. We would purposely not read comments or reviews (or even view trailers) to insure a completely pure viewing experience. Our tickets were essentially sold before ""Saw II"" had closed at our local mega-plex.

Although these economics guaranteed the production of the third installment (and apparently a fourth one), they provide no incentive for producing a film worthy of the preceding two. The original entry had to be good or suffer a ""direct to video"" fate, and the second benefited from (but was not over-whelmed by) a more professional production process because of its higher budget. In additon for the second one there was considerable incentive to prove that the first was not a lucky fluke.

Further red flags go up when you see that ""Saw III"" is using a ""worldwide"" saturation booking technique normally reserved for weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre-release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theatres (3167 in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide). This is normally done with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance. If a film is good it will be exhibited more discreetly because the producers are counting on positive ""buzz"" to promote attendance and reduce marketing costs.

Finally, the critics have overwhelmingly trashed ""Saw III"", even those who were extremely positive about the first two.

So as a potential (not a pre-sold viewer), you get on this site and sift through the comments to try to get a handle on the quality of the film while avoiding major spoilers; and you find an extremely divergent set of comments. My advice is to dig a little deeper into the source of the comments, click to see the comment history of each author. It is generally a good idea to give more weight to the more prolific writers-especially those whose comments about other films mirror your reactions.

In the case of ""Saw III"", the extremely positive (and least detailed) comments on the IMDb are almost exclusively from people for whom this is their first comment. If this seems extremely odd and if you are into conspiracy theories, you should at least consider the possibility that these are planted as part of the film's marketing campaign.

As for myself, I cannot imagine anyone who has not seen the first two films getting much enjoyment out to the third. Although there were times during the viewing process where I wished I was in this group because at least the confusion would have provided some degree of mental challenge during what turned out (IMHO) to be an extremely boring feature.

Nor would I expect anyone who did not get off on blood and gore to find this an enjoyable experience. The ""Saw"" films are in the horror sub-genre made famous by Dario Argneto and Mario Bava. This is called the ""gialli"" (yellow) style. These two Italian makers of horror/ thrillers place a huge emphasis on the deed of murder whereas other styles emphasize the solving of the murder.  Inherent in this style is almost constant self-parody, necessary to expand the target audience beyond the wiggers and drones who flock to the local mall.  The parody element fundamental to the first two installments is in short supply in ""Saw III"",  deliberately inserted into only one scene-the pig rendering trap.

Checking my watch every ten minutes I kept hoping that something would happen to give an interesting tilt to what I had already seen, as had happened in the first two. But by the midway point I had abandoned this (not the checking of my watch but the expectation that any magician could pull a rabbit out of this lame hat).

- REVIEW

""Saw III"" marks the final chapter of the series, and by that, I mean the final chapter with James Wan, Leigh Whannell, and Darren Bousman involved with the franchise (Lionsgate does not want the profitable series to end just yet). Because of that acknowledgement, this will be the last time I'm going to blatantly exploit the use of the word ""saw"", so here it goes.  The ""Saw"" series is a sight to see: it saw the attention it deserves, and it provides many curious horror fans something different to see.  It slices, it dices, and it cuts through the meat and bones, among a whole bunch of cheesy saw-related puns I can't even think of.

In all seriousness, the third outing is a surprising improvement over the previous installment, which I personally felt like it was on auto-pilot for the whole movie, keeping it on a steady pace with little outrageous moments.  It is nothing like that in this sequel, as it moves away the sporadic law-enforcement scenarios, and centers on what's truly important in the series: Jigsaw and his games.  This time, the movie goes behind-the-scenes into the business of his sadistic games.

The sequel acts as a direct continuation of ""Saw II"" as the movie starts off with Marky Mark's brother stuck in a bad predicament thanks to the Jigsaw.  Meanwhile, Dina Meyer's character tries to find him in a series of leads made by Jigsaw's victims.  The continuation was all simply to tie up loose-ends (in a ""Saw"" manner) just so the movie can move along with the confrontation of Jigsaw and his accomplice, Amanda.  That's right: the victim of the first two films is The Jigsaw's partner-in-crime/divine intervention.

A nurse named Lynn is captured by the hands of the duo, because The Jigsaw is not exactly at the top of his game, thanks to the malignant tumor in his noggin.  In this new game, the nurse must forcibly save the life of the husky-voiced maniac in order to save her own, while another (and Jigsaw's last) game takes place for a different victim following a three-step program to bitter torment.  The centered victim of the game is a father sworn for vengeance, and he'll come across paths and choices that will make him question his own principles, and ultimately decide if he achieves the one thing the Jigsaw tries to give to the victims: redemption...along with permanent physical and mental scars.

The sequel furthers the backstory approach of ""Saw II"" as it sheds (or shreds) some more light into Jigsaw's history, but it also explains the relationship between him and Amanda.  Amanda is viewed as a compassionate person who is solely devoted to the killer who she sees as a father figure, so her feelings entices him, yet dreads him at the same time.  Without giving too much away, Amanda is a very interesting character for this sequel.  Their relationship goes further as the movie shows how some of their infamous games were set up, which the flashbacks ties up a few loose-ends of the series; although, it still doesn't explain about the shock treatments from the first movie.  To extend open wounds to the story, Leigh Whannell makes a cameo appearance to explain how his character, Adam, got killed.  The only thing that baffles me about the backstory is when it gets into the intimate life of Jigsaw back when he was known as John: it only last for a couple of seconds and it was never explained as if it's an afterthought for some progression with the nurse.  Although the sequel didn't completely recovered the rough spots of the canon, at least with it solidifies the connection of the whole Jigsaw business.

Story aside, will there be more blood in the games in ""Saw III""?  There will be more blood, alright; there will also be more chains, more broken limbs, more screaming, more begging, more spastic camera movements, basically almost every gruesome thing to please the inner sadist.  Although the games are not quite the focus this time around, there are plenty of them, and most of them are twisted and inventive, just how Wan/Whannell/Bousman likes it.  Some will gross you out, and few will shock you, especially the torture device I like to call ""The Twist.""  Watching the scene with that device makes me think it could've been much more graphic, but that's where uncut DVDs are for.

""Saw III"" brought back the things I like from the original, the claustrophobic scenery, the tough-to-decide nature of the games, and the morbid philosophies of Jigsaw's intentions.  The sequel brings the pieces together, leading to one impressive climax.  To me, this is a satisfying closure to the series.",1162252800,,4870,4.81032412965186

1562161,3,B00005JPBL,"Ever since my first viewing of ""Saw,"" I, like most people, was intrigued and had my faith in modern horror reaffirmed. ""Saw"" emerged in a sea of tamed down, boring and pointless PG-13 movies and has become a modern classic, easily the most noteworthy horror movie to come out since the turn of the century. So, it wasn't surprising that ""Saw II"" was greenlit. Could they keep up the same level of integrity? Or would this franchise sink fast like so many others had before? Luckily, it was a smash. ""Saw II,"" while a different film from the first, was just as engrossing and disturbing as it's predecessor. And naturally, a year later, comes ""Saw III."" Before I get into my review, let me just say you can expect a ""Saw IV"" to hit theaters this time next year.

I have to come right out and say that I left the theater rather disappointed with ""Saw III."" Now, it's not that movie was bad, or that it was a typical, problem-ridden sequel like most of it's kind. The first problem? The movie is way, way too short. Everytime a good idea comes along, it seems like it is rushed out of the way to meet the 90-minute mark. Crucial character development and screentime is so compacted and condensed that it nearly destroys the film completely. What could have been a beautiful and epic story about revenge and redemption really just boils down to gratuitous violence by the end.

Maybe I had expectations that went way too high. I mean, the first two set a standard, but perhaps it was my mistake to assume that director Darren Lynn Bousman and co-creators James Wan and Leigh Wannell are invincible. As shown by this troubled film, they are not. Now, these are hugely talented guys, make no mistake. To establish such a reputation this early in their careers is extraordinary and should be respected. However, one can't help but wonder if their film suffered due to studio pressure. Like I said, the first two set a standard. Perhaps they weren't sure which audience they were supposed to be focusing on: The one that likes to just be shocked, or the one that likes to be shocked and have their minds tickled.

What is good about ""Saw III,"" however, is that it really has/had massive potential to do more. Do I hear ""Director's Cut?"" God, I hope so. The traps this time are of a different breed (check out the ""Pig Grinder"") but also embed themselves into your consciousness perhaps more effectively than before. The overall story is solid and at times, truly touching. I can't say that all the plot-twists weren't predictable, and I can't say all the performances were on-key, but there is definitely a good movie here. It's just smothered. ""Saw III"" is simply hurt by being too brief. Trying to accomplish so much in so little time should never, ever be attempted ever again.",1162166400,,2772,4.607287449392713

 I would have been willing to wait an extra year if the filmmakers could have come up with something better than this monument to human depravity. This film is disturbing -- alright, that's fine, shocking -- lovely, it's what we expect, but also something more. This film is depressing.

 From the very beginning, I have been a Saw fan. Ever since I saw the trailer for the first movie, I loved the concept, and went to see the film during its opening weekend. It was clever, the twist ending was fantastic, and a new horror icon was born. It was a psychological thriller as much as it was a horror movie. The traps were gruesome, yes, but they had a point. What made ""Saw"" a great movie was that the shocks had a point beyond shocking you.

 ""Saw II"" was a great surprise. The story was interesting, the characters were believeable, and the traps were stepped up a notch but still had a point. The infamous 'needle pit' will stand out in horror movie history.

 The first two movies were intelligent, well-thought-out horror movies.

 No longer.

 ""Saw III"" is depraved. The traps serve no purpose but to shock you. That is what I got out of the movie, which is fine on its own. ""Saw III"" on its own would stand head and shoulders above most horror movies. But I expected more from this film. ""Saw"" has degenerated into ""Hostel"" without any reason. I enjoyed ""Hostel"" because I got exactly what I was expecting -- basically, a snuff film. I expected something somewhat intelligent from ""Saw III"" because the other two were so innovative. ""Saw III,"" however, is not clever, is not intelligent, is forced, and commits suicide at the end. The twist ending that was *intended* is -- dare I say it? -- cliched.

 But the twist ending to this film is not what the filmmakers think it is. The real twist ending is that they've destroyed their series. The film is depressing. The movie's shocks don't retain a certain level of fun such as in the other two movies It keeps you on the edge of your seat, but for the wrong reasons.

STORY: The film begins with Eric Matthews waking up in the bathroom. He breaks his own foot to escape, and Kerry and the others are investigating Troy. After the death of Kerry, Jigsaw is on his last legs. He is in his final hours of life with Cancer, and Amanda kidnaps a doctor named Lynn, and Lynn is to keep Jiggy alive while he is to see if his new test works out.

Tobin Bell is still the man as Jigsaw, but Shawnee Smith and Angus Macfadyen are really strong here as well. I really liked how SAW III had flashbacks that tied all three films together nicely. This may be the best horror series of all time, just for the fact that all the films are pretty good, with none flat out sucking. I think by the way they ended this film, this may be the last film in the series, but when the studio sees how much money it makes this weekend, they may just find away to bring forth SAW IV in time for next Halloween. I think SAW III is the best and most disturbing of the series.",1161993600,2,771,4.045751633986928
1562311,5,B00005JPBL,"This could very well be the final saw movie and I think that is for the best. They don't need to run this in the ground like Freddy, Jason, and Michael Myers, just to name a few. The reason I think that this should be the last installment is because it is the best movie of the trilogy! Never or at least rarely is a third installment better than the first or second, but this movie delivers. It is far more gruesome and intense and the plot is by far the best yet. They pulled out all the stops on this one and you won't believe your eyes when you see some of these scenarios. It ties the story from the first two perfectly and answers all the questions you could possibly have and I think that is great. I don't wanna ramble or describe every detail of the movie to you like everyone else on this website, I just wanna tell you guys to go see this film if you loved the first two. You have to! This movie hit me on so many different levels. I was squirming in my seat and felt truly sorry for the people going through these dastasrdly torture sequences, and you will to. It's guts and glory people and this masterpiece in true horror deserves all the glory it receives. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed. You may wanna have a bag handy if you have a weak stomach though. GO SEE IT! MY GOD IT WAS GREAT!!!!!!!",1161993600,2,1324,4.135658914728682
1562312,4,B00005JPBL,"PREMISE:

Jigsaw, althought brilliant in his own right, has a tendancy of causing mayhem. He kidnaps people and puts them in a contraption that either makes them die, or forces them to lose something in order to gain freedom from his clutches. With the help of his new assistant, Amanda, he is able to continue to do his bidding on the lives of seemingly innocent (although we know better) people.

SYNOPSIS:

In the third, and probably final installment, Jigsaw has kidnapped a doctor, who is going through relationship problems and is disconnected with her children and friends. She is now part of Jigsaw's game. With a bomb wrapped around her neck, she must keep Jigsaw alive long enough for Jigsaw's latest player, Jeff, to escape the trenches of his dark past. Jeff must go through a series of rooms so that he can overcome the loss of his son be defying the people that not only caused his son's death, but did nothing to let the murderer rot in a jail cell. Somehow all of these people are related, and in this movie, you find out exactly how.

MENALITY GOING IN:

I did expect a lot. After seeing Saw, I was amazed at the clever writing, brilliant trap design, great acting, and overall erieness of the film. It was grotesque, dark, and fantastic. With an incredibly small budget, the film still managed to make a large bank, enough money in fact to pay for the next two movies. In Saw 2, the writers went in a different direction. They made it seem more like a Ratrace to get to the exit point and overcome the challenges along the way. Like the first movie, every player in the game was somehow connected, and they all had to choose their fate. The second one really made you understand Jigsaw's motives, and what he was trying to accomplish. The message was that you must not take life for granted, and must give up the things we love the most to deserve the right to live. A man of few, but powerful words. With all this prior experience with the film, I was very confident that the third film will live up to the hype, and live up to the Saw petigree.

REVIEW:

This film, at least at the beginning, seemed to try to go back to its roots. It was focusing on single person trying to escape, as opposed to a large group. Continue directly after the last movie, Daniel's father was trapped with a chain on his foot and left for dead. Directly following this trap, you are led to two more victims, in difference scenarios. What makes this dumb is, how they really don't connect to the main story. As things unfold, you are led on an emotional roller coaster, while we see Amanda and Jigsaw's disfunctional relationship fall apart. On his deathbed, Jigsaw is testing Jeff, who recently lost his son, and must face the witness who fled from the scene and could have put the murderer behind bars for life, the judge who let the murderer go, and finally the murderer himself. The traps weren't for him, and if he wanted, he could have let all three of them go. Jigsaw's task was to test his forgiveness, and see if he could finally let the past go and move on with his life. Jeff was obsessed with wanting to find and kill the murderer, and it was starting to distract and tear apart his family. Lynn, the doctor, has a neck brace with explosives set around the edges. If Jigsaw's heartrate flatlines, they explode, and she dies. She is forced to operate on his against his will to postpone his emminent death from his hemorrhaging brain long enough so that Jeff could erase his past. Amanda, who was saved by Jigsaw has been part of Jigsaw's game before. She had to cut a man open in the first one, and was thrown into a pit of syringes in the second one. Without giving too much away, I can say this, each movie had a really surprise ending that made you reevaluate the entire movie and totally threw you for a loop. This one, not so much. Although many of the traps were well executed and brilliant, they lacked the clever enginuity of the first two movies, and although the shock value was higher in this film, the twist at the end just wasn't as unpredictable is in the first two. One thing I did like though, was how the movie focused more one the victims than the on the cops, which is good to see. This makes you really understand the character more, like you have a deep seated relationship with them. Makes their story more effective if they were to die.

BOTTOM LINE:

I'd say that this is the weakest of the three films, but I wasn't entirely disappointed. The movie was still great, and had a few nice touches that made this a welcome edition to the Saw family.

RATING: B (4/5 stars)",1161907200,2,4602,4.429078014184397
1562313,3,B00005JPBL,"You know how trilogies that are based on one idea tend to lose their edge? Welcome to ""Saw III."" It is not as tense as the second (and best in this franchise), nor does it have the benefit of the surprise shock of the first (a movie I found to be enjoyable but grossly over-rated). Where ""Saw 2"" had the benefit of multiple characters playing cat and mouse in a single venue, ""Saw III"" pits Jigsaw and his protege Amanda against a Doctor and a man consumed by guilt. In other words, you have to care about how these four people play against each other in order to get caught up in the movie. A drawback to the original ""Saw"" was the fact that the acting was so hammily bad that I spent more time wondering about the film's many plotholes and continuity issues (climbing from a bathtub and not being wet?) than caring about the fates of the characters...and that happens here to a lesser degree.

But I am sure that most of the viewers to ""Saw III"" could give a rat's beak about such mundane things as plot. It's the gruesomely inventive tortures that matter here, and ""Saw III"" really delivers on the gore and gross points. As Jeff (Angus McFayden) tries to negotiate his way out of one of Jigsaw's death mazes, he is forced to confront his own rage and guilt over the loss of his son to a drunk driver. Instead of being the one in eminent danger of death, he must save those he feels responsible for the leniency shown the killer of the boy. And each of these victims is tortured in variously cinematic disgusting manners. (The pig-guts trap on the judge offers a minor funny subtext.)

Meanwhile, Jigsaw (played with subtle malevolence by Tobin Bell) is playing mind games with the doctor he has kidnapped into performing surgery on his cancer ridden brain and his assistant Amanda's slippery grasp on sanity. The gross-out factor here is Really High...I found myself cringing more in these surgical segments than during the those involving the death-traps. In an effort to shore up the motivational factors, ""Saw III"" lays on the flashbacks. You discover more of what brought Amanda under Jigsaw's spell, how the fates of the victims in one and two wrapped up (writer director Leigh Whannel shows up in that bathroom again, Donnie Wahlberg does as well) and the setups for the games of the prior flicks get explained, more or less.

Which is dead weight, frankly. The first two ""Saw"" movies came in at under two hours, working at a relentless pace (especially ""Saw 2""). Logging two hours and change drags the suspense out and made me wonder why I was being shown the back stories when I really wanted to see just how cinematically the next kill would be rendered. After all, the ""Saw"" franchise is a horror show with pain and suffering the real lead actors in a twisted morality play. The twist involving the four leads - and the fact that Jeff is forced to save the victims and not kill them in his Jigsaw game - is the biggest difference and greatest strength in ""Saw III."" But otherwise, there are segments of the movie that are as bloated as the hog carcasses being fed into the film's abattoir scene.",1161907200,,3108,4.546428571428572

7941543,5,B00005JPBL,"Better than the second and highly rewatchable.  Ive come to quite enjoy the highly different styles of these first three moves.  This is the most gruesome so far, but it still takes time to thoughtfully develop the overarching franchise story.

As Saw II (2005) rolled the credits, we left Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg; Dead Silence, Saw II-IV) for dead in the very same filth-painted bathroom as we opened and closed in part I, and Jigsaw (Tobin Bell; Boogeyman 2-3, Saw I-VII) escaped with his disciple Amanda (Shawnee Smith; The Blob, Saw I-III/VI, The Grudge 3). This sequel picks up right in that very same bathroom, with its accumulated cadavers ever more decayed.  Now on the third film in as many years, director Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II-IV, The Devils Carnival, Mothers Day), writer Leigh Whannell (Insidious 1-4, Saw I-III, Cooties) and executive producer James Wan (The Conjuring 1-2, Insidious 1-2) continue Jigsaws intestine-exposing shenanigans.

Whereas part I was character and story-driven, part II was a chaotically mean funhouse of horrors, and now part III takes yet a new approachthat of a Final Destination-style kill flick that basks in the gory glory of its death scenes.  Basically, while thoughtfully deepening the over-arching franchise story, these sequels keep getting meaner and clearly delight on transforming each subsequent release into something devastatingly harder to watch than the last.

Everything is yet more gruesome and brutal as we skip the saw and go right for bone-crushing blunt-force trauma.  The early chained victim sequence is viciously cruel, with the rib-ripping harness and the hypothermia rig follow suit.  But something else is new beyond the more abundantly showcased chunks of gore.  The camera lingers more on the suffering  The brain surgery scene offers exactly what you expect, yet takes its time to such extent that you find yourself dreading each application of the power drill.  Paving the way for films like Evil Dead (2013) and Drag Me to Hell (2009), the offal pit offers waves of putrefied bodies frappe-blended into a slimy drowning pool and the rack regaled us with the sounds of slippery twisting flesh punctuated by cracking and splintering bones exposing themselves through mangled skin.  Thats right, peopledont watch this with your grandmother.

----During the offal pit scene, I was eating scrambled eggs with chunks of bacon covered in (no joke, folks) a green avocado chili sauce.  Nice timing.  LOL.----

Each movie seems to have its star victim; the one with the deck stacked most against them. Gordon in part I, Detective Matthews son in part II, and part III follows Jeff (Angus Macfadyen; Saw IV) who encounters death trap victims at the mercy of his forgiveness.  Yesforgiveness.  This film is about redemption.  Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer; Bats, Saw I-IV, Piranha 3D) seeks to save Matthews, Amanda is trying to save Jigsaw, Jigsaw wants to save Amanda, and Jeff is challenged to save his family.

As each film in the series advances, so advances John Kramers cancer.  Now near death in his work shop, Amanda continues his handy work as we explore the history of their relationshipher frailty, his hopes for her, her jealousy, his disappointmentand how much it has evolved over the course of three films.  And therein lies the elegance of the franchisethree stylistically different films with three different approaches, but all stacking the deck high.  I continue to love all three films, but this third installment is probably the most rewatchable.",1506124800,,3546,5.180701754385965
