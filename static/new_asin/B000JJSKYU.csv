You don't go to Something Weird DVDs for high art, people. It's erotica, it's genre films, it's usually shot on a shoestring. These being 60s films, you don't get bush or oil-drilling shots, but that doesn't mean they're not erotic! They're cheap, sure, but kinky in their own way.

Ok, ""Electronic Lover""...here's one for the peeping Toms out there. ""Master"" sends out his minion ""Brother"" to film women so he can watch them through his wall-size computer/monitor he has in his canvas-walled ""lair"". The computer constantly makes sounds like a Moog having a seizure. Master becomes obsessed with a black woman, played by Linda Boyce. We are introduced to her while she dances nude with a blonde woman in a very striking scene that reminds me of Soledad Miranda's first dance in ""Vampyros Lesbos"". Master fantasizes about her, and imagines her dancing for him. Best scene of the film. He then proceeds to lose his mind. A woman takes over his lair, and Brother goes peeping for her. The end.

An enjoyable twisted film, and Linda Boyce looks amazing. She is an absolute goddess! Sculpted out of ebony, just beautiful. That scene where she dances with the blonde woman, their skin tones offset...it's such a beautiful scene of two races together. Coming out of the 60's, I'd almost consider it a civil rights statement! And the later scene where Linda looks up and sees Brother's peeping camera, and then smiles, is lovely. A bizarre plot tying it all together, but definitely kinky.

THE SPY WHO CAME is not quite so entertaining. Most of the bad guys are laughable cliches, while our hero has all the personality of a lump of clay. And the theme song is intrusively annoying! Yet this movie does have it's pervy joys, and a dark little heart at times. Brainwashing, girls in chains, girls being drugged, several nice butts on display too. And that scene  in the middle where the girl is grinding on the mannequins lap...that's a nice one. And the British spymaster/dominatrix is particularly fetching too.

EXTRAS on this disc are entertaining. You have several computer themed sexy trailers, including one for ""The Curious Dr. Humpp"", a movie familiar to many SW fans.  Does that not look like the best movie ever? Tel Star Striptease has two schmucks looking into a computer screen and watching 3 or 4 mediocre burlesque numbers. ""Girl of My Dreams"" doesn't really fit the computer theme - it's a very homemade dime-peeper type short - but it is 16 minutes of hanging out with a nude woman, so who's complaining? Though that vertical C section scar...yikes, girl.

So, there's a long drawn out review. I think these are two good examples of 60's B&W softcore exploitation films. Done on Z budgets, sure, but they're both nicely fetishistic in their own way. Don't hesitate to add this one to your cult cinema shelf.",1416614400,8,2950,4.759295499021526
