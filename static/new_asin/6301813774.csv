7815815,5,6301813774,I don't understand why there has been no DVD release of this great movie thriller. They release garbage movies while good ones like this waste away on a shelf somewhere. I watch it every time it's on a streaming service. Somebody tell the Beancounters they are losing money by not releasing this cult movie. Amazon please listen to your subscribers and release it for sale on instant video or DVD. THANKS!!!!!!,1385078400,2,410,4.788732394366197
7815816,4,6301813774,"Originally released on cable television back in the early 90s, THE CHINA LAKE MURDERS is a surprisingly effective thriller thanks to good direction, acting, and writing.  The story of a deranged policeman's annual killing spree in a small town and the local cop who engages him in a dangerous game of wits is played out in a strong, suspenseful drama that builds to a satisfying climax.  Setting and atmosphere are particularly well developed, and despite the exploitable subject matter nothing ever goes over the top, adding a layer of believability which ratchets the suspense even higher.  Tom Skerritt is great as Sherriff Sam Brodie, and Nancy Everhard is a strong and appealing romantic interest for him.  Doesn't get played on TV as often as it once did and not readily available on home video either, THE CHINA LAKE MURDERS is a rare gem in the world of made-for-TV drama.  More than worth a look if you can find it.",1167004800,4,924,4.786163522012578

7815819,2,6301813774,"Because I'm nice, and was looking to see if the Wolf Lake series had been released, I looked this up for you all:

It's actually an alternate title for the movie The Honor Guard, which is about a man unhinged by his son's death in the Vietnam war, who then goes on to terrorize a young couple.

So, there you are. :)  It was made in 1979.",1104883200,12,338,4.014925373134329
7815820,4,6301813774,"The one thing that surprsied me about this film that it was made for cable not for theatrical release being it was such a good film. Tom Skerrit plays a local sheriff of a small comunity who investigates a big time cop  suspious activites everytime he comes to town someone is killed. So the  game of good cop against bad cop begins. Skerrit plays his character with  such conviction and reality that`s it`s no wonder he remains such a good  actor for many years. i think having the story taking place in a smalltown  is a great idea no one would ever belive such a thing could ever take place  in a smalltown as oppose to the big city. The ending of the film was good  did not go overboard like some thrillers do today the villian got what he  desrverd brought down by a hail of bullets, by fellow police officers not  by the main character, which makes for a very interesting standout. I have  seen this film countless times since i`ts intital relesase in 1990. Ten  years later its still worthwhile to see.",957398400,11,1009,4.4
