Got it yesterday and put it in my DVD player, wouldn't load, something wrong with disc, my tv told me..checked it, no scratches, put it in again, same thing...I think this was not a new disc.  It's trash now, so no returning, just going to PBS and buying it there...",1500163200,,369,4.575757575757576

8710684,5,B00VNQWVRA,"This was a very interesting video of interviews with actors that were in the motion picture or their children.  It also delves into how the town
was affected by the film crew and actors.",1441238400,,186,4.470588235294118

8710686,5,B00VNQWVRA,"If you are a fan of the 1956 film Giant, then you will enjoy this documentary that was shown on PBS in April 2015. It blends archival footage, film clips, and contemporary interviews with both those that participated in making the film (Earl Holliman, Elsa Cardenas, and extras) and people living in the Marfa, Texas, area where the exterior shots were filmed. The film has a focus on the true life discrimination against Hispanics that the film depicted and challenged.  Two scenes among others are looked at in depth: the funeral of a Hispanic soldier and the fight in Sarge's diner between Sarge and Bick played by Rock Hudson. Nice music score in stereo and well-written narration.",1438473600,3,685,4.854700854700854
