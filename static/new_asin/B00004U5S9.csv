1354143,5,B00004U5S9,"Jubei-chan is about as absurd as anything you would want to see.  It's  also undeniably funny, but certainly not for everyone.  Poor 13 year-old  Jiyu, as the unwilling heir to the greatest swordsman of all time, is  threatened by the grudge of that swordsman's enemies.  Poor Koinusuke, the  swordsman's servant who has wandered the earth for 300 years looking for  Jiyu, only to find she keeps throwing away the heart-shaped eyepatch which  grants her skill with the sword.  But note: that's the least of the  silliness.  Basically every guy who sees Jiyu, from the other students to  her teachers, takes one look at her chest and falls in love with her.  This  is even more peculiar, because that chest is always safely hidden away  beneath a school uniform shirt and sweater, and--at least by anime  conventions--it's not especially out of proportion.  There's no nudity  worries here, at least in this first disc.  Jubei-chan is certainly much  less lewd than the average American sitcom (basically, the boys think about  Jiyu and picture her still-in-sweater chest).
This show is NOT a drama,  at least not in this first disc: it is a comedy which has some very nicely  done fighting sequences in it.  While some conventional elements of a drama  are present, they are deliberately absurd--you aren't supposed to take  Jiyu's predicament seriously.  The characters, not any sense of drama, make  this work: some of the best scenes are between Koinusuke and Jiyu's father,  who repeatedly tries and fails to understand why a samurai is now living in  his house as his daughter's servant.  If you can deal with the frequent  references to Jiyu's chest, you will laugh a lot while watching this disc.",968371200,13,1703,4.925531914893617
1354144,5,B00004U5S9,"If you are an anime fan, and are looking for something new, and fresh, this is it! Jubei-chan is an extremely funny anime, and I would recommend it to all. Though I have only seen the first few episodes on the tape, it  was enough to make me want to purchase it. I really do suggest your order  this. =)",964137600,,303,4.033333333333333
1354145,4,B00004U5S9,I saw part of this film at an anime special showing of parts of series'. My friends and I were very impressed with the way the story was portrayed with both humor and great action sequences.,962236800,,190,4.305555555555555
7923630,3,B00004U5S9,"It's cheap....but you really get what you pay for. It's rather amusing, and the action scenes are done fairly well, but there's a lot of holes. There's too much humor that's incredibly stupid and better suited for the younger audience. If you're over 13, I wouldn't reccomend buying this anime new....get it used and for cheap. You're MUCH better off saving your money and getting Rounin Kenshin.",1113868800,,396,4.925373134328358
7923631,5,B00004U5S9,"In this anime seven pretty Japanese girls are invited into the Magic Mirror Bus, the go-anywhere anime studio operated by Jubei, and kick the crotch area of Japanese anime characters. It's a rather unique fetish, but Jubei does it well: you get to see the shy, funny expressions on the faces of the girls as they're asked to kick, and the camera angles (including those all-important ""low angle"" shots). It's great to see these shy, laughing girls try to overcome their inhibitions and kick out with all their might. A great item for fans of the ball-kicking fetish known as ""tamakeri.""",1044748800,2,586,4.811881188118812
7923632,4,B00004U5S9,"I first saw the trailer for Jubei-chan on one of the vollumes of Outlaw Star, and in my head it clicked and said that I should see this little mini seris. I am glad I did. The 13 episode seris all starts with this volume. If you don't watch this one you will have no Earthly idea what is happening in the rest of the seris.
300 years ago the great swordsmen Yagu Jubei lost his life in the desprate fight against the Ryojoji Shinkagario. Before he died Jubei told his trusted friend Koinosuke Odago to find his succesor. When Koinosuke asks Lord Jubei how he will know the individual that will carry out his sword, he answers ""A big pair of bouncy bon-bons"" (sub version).Just prior to Jubei dieing he hands Koinosuke an eye patch, in the shape of a heart. He said that the pupil who wears the Lovely Eyepatch would aqurire his skills. Then Jubei dies. For the next 300 years, surviving on his spirit alone, Koinosuke Odago takes up the quest to find the succsesor of Yagu Jubei.
Then you meet Jiyu ""Jubei"" Nanohana, a 14 (?) year old 8th student who just moved to a new town. Along with the struggles of being a new student in a middle school, Jiyu has attracted the attention of 2 middle school boys, Shiro, and Bantaro (AKA Ban.
When Jiyu gets lost on her way home from school, she runs into Koinosuke. Koinosuke dose his best to convice Jiyu to behold the Lovely Eye Patch. Jiyu, being a normal teenager refuses to listen to Koinosuke. But when a new evil force appears and attacks Sai Nanohana (jiyu's dad), as if on cue Koinosuke appears, and puts the Lovely Eyepatch on Jiyu. Then Jiyu transforms into the great warrior Yagu Jebei The Second. After defeateing her first new enemy, Jiyu refuses to yeild the eyepatch.
How will Koinosuke convince a pluky, loudmouthed, smart alleck teenager that she is the savior of the world? And will Jiyu listen the what Koinosuke was to say? Watch this and you will find out
If you are a fan of Sailormoon, then you will more than likely enjoy this. It has the magical girl plot. The reason that I only gave it 4 stars is because, a little too much time is spent on the DVD with Shiro and Ban fawnning over Jiyu. After a while that starts to get a little boring. Other than that the DVD is well worth the money",1034899200,2,2253,4.366666666666666

i love it.  It's hilarious.  Most silly animation I've seen.  Voices (subbed version) are exellent!  This anime goes from humor to drama to action and back again in 5 minutes, it's amazing.
Content wise there's nothing wrong with this anime aside from a couple boob jokes.  No nudity, profanity, or blood.
the storyline is relatively compelling, but not super.  The episodes seem to center more on entertaining the viewer than progressing the storyline.
The dubbed version is even good with the exception of Jubei's voice.  She's supposed to be like 14 or 15 years old and her English dub over voice make her seem like she's 25 or so.
On a final note, the DVD menu for scene selection is the most organized I've seen, some dvd's put a very poor effort into this aspect of their product, resulting it it being hard to figure out where you need to start playing at.  Say if you stopped at episode 2, then the next day went back to watch the rest, it was very easy to find your place.  If anyone has ever tried to use scene selection on the DVD of Angel Sanctuary, you know what I mean.

7923634,4,B00004U5S9,"Man this title threw me off.  I thought it was going to be a bit like Shadow skills, but it was way better than that.  The humor reminded me of a mix 'tween Maze and Those who Hunt Elves.  The characters are awesomely funny!  Of course my fave is the father but hey they're all great.  Definately picking up Vol 2!!",996192000,,315,4.098360655737705
7923635,5,B00004U5S9,"As soon I saw the trailer for this on one of my Escaflowne DVDs, I had decided that I was going to get the first DVD and see how this series was. And by the first DVD, or rather, the first episode, I was totally and utterly hooked into this new series!
 First, you learn the sercret of Yagyu Jubei, the greatest swordsman, and how he died and passed the Lovely Eyepatch, containing his abilities, onto his suitable successor. And what's more, his disciple, Koinosuke Odago, had to search for 300 years to find the right person.... Jiyu Nanohana! Unwilling and unwanting, Jiyu (known as Jubei by her friends and family) does not really want to inherit the powers of the Lovely Eyepatch.. and Koinosuke must make her see that she must, in order to protect herself and others from the Ryujoji clan, who wants to rule the world with the power of the sword!
  I am an all-out anime fan, and like any kind of anime, so I immediately liked this one. But if you're the type for ""gloomy"" anime, this ""may"" (and i mean may) not be something for you.... But then again, the sword fights are always fun to watch, and the humor will always keep you laughing.
  So, if you do decide to buy it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! And as Vash the Stampede would say, Love and peace to everyone!! ^_~ ja!",995500800,3,1290,4.292181069958848
7923636,5,B00004U5S9,I luv this dvd its so funny. =^o^= I am usually a comedy type person so as soon as I saw my first ep. where The Silent Ninja Clan attacks the Nanohana household I knew I had to get this series. After I started to collect it and saw the warning about staying as far away from the tv as possible and watch in a well lit room during a insite of the fight that was ocuring I became a Jubei ... and needed to get all 4 of them asap. The animation is funny because it goes from good to bad in secs on perpose. The plot is u sorta typical storyline tho I guess sorta like a mix of stuff. The comedy is funny tho and stuff is linked together throughout the series like the Jubei-Yaki n stuff. The fighting sceens are so cool because it doesnt do that fake... where they stand still then attack then the bad guy falls down. They acually clash swords and move and just the right speed panning the view in and out so u can see it from dif angles. The ending has got to be the most suprising thing tho =^o^=. Hmm let me think...In con if u liked anime like Excel Saga or Dragon Half of stuff thats just funny like that then u will like this series. I give it the big happi kitty face stamp o aproval,992217600,,1187,3.95
7923637,5,B00004U5S9,"Oh my god, this is the funniest anime that I have ever seen!  I laughed so hard that my stomach hurt, and I almost wet myself.  It's about an absent-minded 8th grade girl who happens to have inherited the awesome powers of the greatest swordsman in the land, but she doesn't even know it.  I admit, it does sound kind of cheesy, but the overall humor makes up for any flaws that the series might have.  Ah, I laughed, I cried (from laughing too hard), this is definately the greatest anime that I have ever seen.",987292800,,512,4.302083333333333
7923638,3,B00004U5S9,"From seeing this for the first time, you wouldn't think this was one of those 'magical girl' shows.  A closer look, though, reveals just about every element a 'magical girl' show needs:  cute teenage girl as the lead, an otherwordly 'mascot' who also bestows upon her the power to transform into a super-heroine, the trinket that enables her to change, and her weirder-than-usual enemies.  Oh, and don't forget the tried-and-true stock-footage transformation sequence!  Don't be turned away by all this, though.  ""Jubei-Chan"" is one of the freshest new shows of the year.  The plot elements are original.  The characters are borderline insane.  The soundtrack's even good!  Not only that, the show is just plain hilarious.  I used muscles laughing that I hadn't used in years.  The first volume mainly deals with character introduction and the beginning of the story, but the action starts almost right away.  It's by no means your average 'magical girl' show.  The only detractors I saw were the dubbing, which is pretty horrendous, and the overuse of stock footage.  Otherwise, it's worth a look to fans of ""Sailor Moon"" and the like, and to people who just want to see something different, 'cause believe me, it is.",984355200,,1218,4.9950248756218905
7923639,4,B00004U5S9,"Jubei-chan the Ninja girl is an interesting series.  It's almost like 2 series rolled into one.  Part of the series is slapstick type of comedy, and the animation fits it for these parts.  Going super-deformed in some spots, fine in others.  The slapstick is totally funny, but the things to watch for are the fight scenes!  This series is strange, but you must see it for the fight scenes.  Most anime have pretty boring fight scenes, some that have only to slashes across the screne.  This anime, however, has huge fight scenes.  Dynamic camera angles, and fluid motion, never resorting to the slash, slash type of anime!  Very cool....Pick this one up, but rent or buy the first one.  This volume is a little more serious, and picks up on the story more, but the first volume introduces the characters, and has great fight scenes!",972604800,3,833,4.682758620689655
