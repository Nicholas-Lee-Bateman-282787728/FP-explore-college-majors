What a fascinating journey it is with Professor michael Krasny as your guide through more than a century of short fiction masterpieces.  All the way from Edgar Alan Poe to Nadine Gordimer and Raymond Carver.
It's more like a literary buffet to be able to not only read these tales, (many of them are free to read online due to copyright expiration) but also learn the life story of each author and learn the forces that influenced their writing.
