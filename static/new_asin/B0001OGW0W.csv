2022927,1,B0001OGW0W,"Don't take a chance on these discs as I did...wait for a studio release of the movies instead.
Platinum has done the type of job which could be expected of them...poor.
First, the transfer was made, not with the original films, but with the syndicated television versions of later years. Thus, each movie starts with excerpts from the movie to follow, and then with the King Features Syndicate opening credit sequence.
The picture on these transfers are muted grays. Never do any of the blacks look black, or whites look white.
WORST OF ALL, concerning the video portion....Platinum has elected to place a company logo ""bug"" in the lower right hand corner...just the type of nonsense that one buys DVD's to avoid!!!!
The sound is equally poor...a steady stream of background noise appears throughout the movie, and the volume must be turned up to hear the dialogue.
All in all, this is a set to avoid, regardless of your feeling toward these movies.",1088726400,55,949,4.828220858895706
2022928,4,B0001OGW0W,"I found the Platinum release of ""Blondie - volume 2"" to have a good picture and good sound, not perfection but completley watchable and enjoyable a real bargain for $5.  This disc features 5 episodes running about 70 minutes each on a single side of one disc. I won't list the episodes since someone already has.  These 5 shows are from 1940 to 1942, and have guest stars Glen Ford, William Frawley, & Lloyd Bridges featured in some of the shows. The Platinum set will definitely satisfy any Blondie fan until a bigger better boxed set comes along.  The one disconcerting thing about this set is the way when you click on an episode to watch it - it shows 3 to 4 minutes of previews of the film you are about to see before the opening song. I found this confusing and always left me scratching my head and wondering if I'd pushed the wrong button. Also all the episodes are on one side of the disc so if your home sick you can click ""play all"" and not have to get out of bed to flip the disc over. This is good wholesome family fun and a joy to see again after all these years.  I hope they put out more volumes in the future.",1086048000,13,1126,4.175115207373272
2022929,2,B0001OGW0W,"Note: Partially similar review of Vol 1.
They should have put 2-3 per DVD instead of five on one.  During high motion (Dagwood running out the door late for the bus, or Daisy running to get the newspaper) you'll be sure to notice blocky video.  I'm sure the originals didn't have that.
Regardless of the above, the movies are still very enjoyable to watch and I appreciate the fact that they're available on DVD.
Conclusion:  Movies get 5 Stars and DVD production/compression gets 2 stars.",1085875200,26,489,4.729411764705882
2022930,3,B0001OGW0W,"Sometimes there is a reason you can get five movies on one DVD for about $5.  While the sound has been digitally mastered the the prints are murky and/or greenish with a fair amount of flicker.
This is a Hearst Entertainment/King Features set so it begins with those pointless movie excerpts leading into the annoying theme song.  It's sad that Columbia hasn't released an actual set with the Chic Young opening credits intact and restored prints.  I recommend this set if you are a Blondie fanatic and do not mind VHS quality on a DVD.",1081900800,11,536,4.621052631578947
2022931,5,B0001OGW0W,"This DVD is an incredible value and a real treasure. The DVD includes five complete episodes of the Blondie comedies from the 1940s for an astonishingly low price. These remastered movies have very good sound and visual quality. The comedies have also held up very well and are as funny and engaging as they were over half a century ago. Baby Dumpling and Daisy the dog are cute scene-stealers throughout the series. My teenage daughter actually laughs out loud at these comedies, and it's a nostalgic pleasure for me to watch them again after so many years. Because of the enjoyable experience of watching these comedies and the exceptional value, I'd award them more than five stars if I could. This purchase is worth many times the price I paid. (Although the DVD case lists the run time as 72 minutes, the actual run time is five times that since each episode runs a little over 70 minutes.) This DVD features ""Blondie has Servant Trouble,"" Blondie Plays Cupid,"" ""Blondie Goes Latin,"" ""Blondie in Society,"" and ""Blondie Goes to College.""",1081468800,11,1041,4.82122905027933

2023076,4,B0001OGW0W,"Blondie Volume 2 DVD

The ""Blondie"" films used the characters from a popular comic strip in stories written by Hollywood. The situations reflect family life with a drama that is unusual for an ordinary family. These comic adventures were popular with the public so 28 films were produced over 12 years, a record that surpassed Abbott & Costello. The Bumsteads live in a house, they do not live in a rented flat. Blondie is shown as all knowing, and Dagwood as a bungler. Yet Dagwood has a responsible job and a private office as the assistant to the owner of a construction company. Blondie handles the money but cost-analyst Dagwood does not! The risky employment of office worker Dagwood seems unusual.

Dagwood catches a bus to get to work in the business district. What did you notice about life in those days? Most of the conflicts are over money or spending priorities. The Great Depression is unmentionable. You will watch the children grow over the years. These stories provide a comic view of ordinary life around 1941. [How do they compare to ""Married With Children""?]

2023077,3,B0001OGW0W,"This is a great value, however I wish King Features Syndicate would have left the original film titles on these films!  The versions on these DVDs were edited for TV (probably in the 50s, and have the Blondie TV Show Theme instead of the original movie titles, and the end music etc were simply cut off and the movie ends very abruptly.

The plots are kind of stupid, but I watch them for all the little gags that are really funny!  I love Blondie's wardrobe and those kitchen curtains!

2023081,3,B0001OGW0W,A great introdution to comic strips come to life in the movies.  This series of films (28)give B Movies a good name.

2023082,4,B0001OGW0W,"For those old enough to remember, this collection of five Blondie movies feels like a return to a gentler time.  Even if you haven't seen the Blondie movies, they may feel familiar just because of their similiarities to the situation comedies of the 50's and 60's.

The stories are simple and nicely told.  The movies are also interesting as a glimpse into America's less politically correct past. In one of the movies, for example, Blondie and Dagwood assume that a black man whom they meet in a mansion is a servant.  This proves not to be the case.  I won't spoil the plot by saying why he is there.  It is enough to notice that the screenwriters at the time thought it appropriate for Blondie and Dagwood to assume that he is there as a servant.

The character of Blondie obviously predates the women's movement.  Whenever she even slightly presses a wife's boundaries, things always go badly for her and she happily returns to the traditional role of wife and mother.  Blondie is no Murphy Brown.  But she does make a pretty good Doris Day.

I recommend this movie collection to anyone who enjoys the classic situation comedies of the 50's and 60's.  But, if you like Friends, you may not like the movies in this collection.

Endnote: a reminder not to confuse the actor with the part
Though the character of Blondie precedes the women's movement, that is not true of Penny Singleton, the actress who player her. Ms. Singleton died in 2003 at the age of 95.  Her offscreen activities included leading a strike by the Radio City Rockettes, and being the first woman president of an AFL-CIO union.  No doubt, if Mr Dithers (Dagwood's boss) had had to deal with Ms. Singleton instead of Mrs. Bumstead, the plot lines would have been very different.",1173571200,5,1750,4.6547231270358305
2023083,5,B0001OGW0W,"What a great walk back down memory lane when you could watch something on television that was full of laughter that the entire family could watch.

2023084,5,B0001OGW0W,"Platnium Disc Corporation comes up with another cute cover for Volume 2 of the ""Blondie"" film series.  The back cover has a typo.  While they do spell correctly ""Danny Mummert"" in one entry, the ""Blondie Goes To College"" entry on the back cover has mispelled his name as ""Memmert"".  All well.  ""E"" for enjoyable and entertainment and that is what the next five ""Blondie"" films will bring you.
BLONDIE HAS SERVANT TROUBLE (1940) 69 min.
  Daisy can't get the newspaper because a black cat went across her path (Daisy is actually a male).  Baby Dumpling (Larry Simms) knows his parents all too well and Alvin (Danny Mummert) comes in to offer his good morning advice.
  One thing I would like to point out here is Fay Helm played ""Mrs. Fuddle.  She played Alvin's mother in four Blondie films this being her last Blondie film.  Fay Helm passed away on September 27, 2003 at the age of 89.
  This film, the sixth in the series, is real cute, however some scenes might be too much for children to watch.  The Bumsteads stay in a haunted house with secret doors and secret passageways.  Watch the fun begin.
  Can you find the upside-down corn flakes box?

BLONDIE PLAYS CUPID (1941) 67 min.
  It's July 3 and Baby Dumpling wants fireworks for the Fourth of July.  Dagwood (Arthur Lake) bought a whole sack full, but Blondie (Penny Singleton) disapproves.  They decide to go to the country, but their trip isn't exactly trouble-free.  Blondie helps a young Glenn Young get back with his fiancee.  The scene after Baby Dumpling drives away in the car, Blondie and the others rush out on the front porch.  There you will see a properly-hung American flag with only 48 stars.  The movie was filmed in 1940.  Alaska and Hawaii had not entered the Union until 1959.  There is your history lesson for today.

BLONDIE GOES LATIN (1941) 67 min.
  This is the 8th film in the seires of 28 (1938-50).  Alvin is nice enough to visit the Bumsteads and give flowers to Blondie.  He has a poem to read titled, ""The Bumsteads Go To South America"".  The Bumstead family gets to go on a six-week cruise to South America thanks to Mr. Dithers.  Well, a telegram comes for Mr. Dithers.  To close a deal at the office, someone must be at the office Tuesday.  This is Mr. Dithers health cruise, so that means Dagwood must leave the ship to be at the office.  After all, Mr. Dithers is Dagwood's boss.  But Dithers insists on Blondie, Baby Dumpling and Daisy too to stay on the ship with him with his compliments.  Dagwood says a tearful goodbye.  Well, as you will see, Dagwood doesn't quite make it ashore.  He is still on the boat and is trying to hide rom Mr. Dithers.  Baby Dumpling meets a little girl (Janet Burston) and they sing a duet.  Penny Singleton gets to sing three beautiful somgs and dances too.

BLONDIE IN SOCIETY (1941) 75 min.
  Dagwood comes home to find the police waiting for him.  Someone has forged Dagwood's signature on his check, but as it turns out Dagwood did it himself to get paid back. What on earth was Dagwood thinking?  Now you know why they call him Dagwood.  Blondie sure is upset. Alvin drops by and lets Blondie know he heard the argument all the way in his house.  Baby Dumpling and Alvin begin to use slang, much to the disapproval of Blondie.  Dagwood buys a show dog that causes havoc in the Bumstead house.  The mailman is hiding in the tree this time and we all know why.  William Frawley plays a dog owner.  This role was 10 years before the ""I Love Lucy"" tv series. This film is perhaps a bit unpleasant at times to watch.  Too much serious Bumstead arguing and yelling.

BLONDIE GOES TO COLLEGE (1942) 73 min.
  This is the tenth film (of 28) in the Blondie film series.  The Bumsteads go to the football game, but Baby Dumpling is a bit disappointed.  The seats are right in the center of the goal posts and he can't see a thing.  But Baby does manage to catch the special football.  Dagwood decides he wants to go to college for the first time.  Later, Blondie wants him to stop dreaming and not be late for work this morning.  Blondie decides to talk to Mr. Dithers. Dithers thinks it's a great idea for Dagwood to go to college to get it out of his system.  He thinks Blondie should go to.  But Blondie has another idea. She's going to have another baby.  Dagwood doesn't know yet.  Lloyd Bridges plays a college student.  Sid Melton plays ""Mouse"".  Notice the scene when Dagwood tells Mrs. Dill that he dreamed he was a baby, and then yawns.  Notice Larry Simms laughing abit at Arthur.
  DVD contains no extras, no bonuses, no insert.

2023085,4,B0001OGW0W,"When I was a kid back in the 1970's, almost every weekend, I would sit (with a bowl of Coco Puffs) in front of my family's little 19"" inch set and watch a Baltimore local station broadcast the ""Sunday Morning Movie"". This must have been the start of my love of classic old B&W movies from yesteryear. I loved watching Tarzan, King Kong, Abbott & Costello and the Marx Brother's movies. But among my favorites was watching the 1930's & '40's series of ""Blondie"" movies, that featured actors, Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake. I couldn't get enough of hearing, that exasperated yell of ""Blooondieeee!!"" and watching the poor old mail carrier get run over in more ways then I can count! The 28 films, which ran from 1938-1950 were based on the Chic Young comic strip of the same name. The movies were a hilarious look at family life featuring hapless husband and dad, Dagwood Bumstead (Arthur Lake), his busybody but loving wife, Blondie (Penny Singleton), their precocious child, ""Baby Dumpling"" (Larry Simms) and finally the Marcel Marceau of pooches, Daisey. Most of the films usually had some variation of Dagwood getting fired by his tempermental boss, Mr. Dithers (Jonathan Hale) and Blondie getting him his job back. No, these were not Academy Award winning spectacles. They were just very funny, simple, low budget B films, that were always good for giving big belly laughs. Now, for the first time in 2 volumes the ""Blondie"" series is now available in the DVD format. As far as the quality of the DVDs go, this is the perfect example of ""getting what you pay for"". These budget priced DVDs have been produced on the cheap. The picture quality is watchable, but is on par with a VHS tape. For some strange reason you also get a 5 minute preview (usually the ending of the film) before each feature starts, which can be most disconcerting. Worst of all, every so often, the DVD company's logo appears in the lower corner of the screen! Despite these deficiencies, I would still recommend these DVDs simply because the ""Blondie"" films are so fun and entertaining! Hopefully, some one will have the common sense to put out the other 18 films (especially the ones with WWII era themes & plotlines). Highly recommended for both adults and kids alike!",1091145600,15,2249,4.754475703324808
