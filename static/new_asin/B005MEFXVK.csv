8479354,5,B005MEFXVK,"Having worked out with dozens of exercise DVD's I can say that Yin Yang Fusion is truly unique. The first workout, Cardio:  Expansion and Contraction is full of moves that are not ""the usual"" making the time fly by.  Having a handsome male instructor was a great change-up too.  The Total Body: Strength and Flexibility workout left me with room to improve and a desire to do it as often as I can to master the balancing exercises.  It makes you want to be a graceful as the lovely instructor, Jessica.  The Lower Body: Rhythm and was a fun kickboxing routine that was perfectly paced and allowed me to work on my form when kicking.  Core: Power and Flow and the relaxing segment were well paced, had good reminders to stay relaxed and added to my feeling of having totally conditioned and strengthened my body.  I think this would DVD would make a great gift for a man or a woman as it has no ""girly/feminine moves"" and a male and female instructor.",1352851200,,950,4.456647398843931
8479355,5,B005MEFXVK,"For the days when you need to exercise & it's hard to get moving - this is perfect! Short on time - perfect fit! If you've overdone it working out - perfect!  Working out to the entire DVD is a great well-balanced session. As individual sessions you can use it determining your needs for that day. It's invigorating & relaxing.  The trainers are easy to follow. It's a pleasant atmosphere. In busy schedules, this has great flexibility!  The guy trainer will count in Spanish along with English which is a nice change. He has a very nice accent. They are both easy to understand. For five am workouts, this is a must! Simple & effective!",1330473600,2,637,4.521739130434782
8479356,5,B005MEFXVK,"I'm getting to be more and more of a fan of workouts that give me an option to do one long workout or do several complete segments in the order that I choose to make my own workout.  Sensei Gomez does that in this workout where there are five segments, Cardio, Strength/Flexibility, Lower Body, Core & a relaxion segment.  All are 15 minutes long.  The cardio really gets you moving and was my favorite.  The instruction alternates, and Sensei Gomez does the Cardio, Lower Body & they both do relaxation, and Jessica Smith does Strength/Flexibility & Core.  The toughest I would say is the core section which does a fusion of pilates and some yoga.  I did two of the workouts one day and ended with the relaxation and the other two the next day with the relaxation done to end it nicely.

All of the segments were very good; well taught, well cued and easy to follow.  I would say this workout would be considered intermediate level.  The relaxation segment is a fusion of yoga & tai chi moves and was very centering after all of your hard work.

I previously had not done any of his workouts but consider myself a fan now, as I have purchased two that I know will be in my rotation for a while.

Overall, excellent workout, great instructors and a unique combination workout that will keep you motivated.",1328313600,3,1305,4.487288135593221
8479357,5,B005MEFXVK,"This dvd is appropriate for most all fitness levels-there is something for everyone! Both instructors do a fantastic job w/ form pointers & their cuing is excellent. Tons of variety & time options and so many unique and fun exercises! I really enjoyed all the segments & see myself using this dvd a lot. I can sum this workout up in two words ""unique & fun""! Love the variety. Worked up a great sweat in the cardio section and the core segment is awesome- so many unique moves- I don't know how the instructor comes up w/ so many new exercises to work the abs and keeps it fun. All the segments move right along and keep you moving- no boredom!

The dvd is really versatile and includes five 15 minute workouts that you can choose from or do all for a nice long workout! The dvd is a fusion of martial arts, chi gong, yoga, sculpting & pilates. The 2 instructors workout together in one segment but individually in the other 4. You won't need any equipment and each segment includes a short w/u & c/d. The segments are: Cardio: Expansion & Contraction, Total Body: Strength & Flexibility, Lower Body: Rhythm & Balance, Core: Power & Flow, Relax: Movement & Stillness.",1322438400,8,1167,4.504716981132075
