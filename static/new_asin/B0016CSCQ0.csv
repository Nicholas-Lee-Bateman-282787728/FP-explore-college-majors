The title M comes from a chalk mark (for 'murderer') placed by a beggar on the back of a suspected serial child killer.

Fritz Lang's M (1931) remains remarkably modern despite premiering in the early sound era. Peter Lorre as the homicidal maniac shines in the last 20 minutes or so, after he's cornered by an organized gang of street people and taken to an abandoned warehouse for a mock trial by every grifter, burglar, robber and miscreant in Berlin.

Nothing Lorre ever did subsequently approaches the passion and fear for his life that he exudes in this unfogettable scene in front of a crowd of low-lifes who convicted him even before he was ever apprehended.

Lang's experimentation here with extreme camera angles, shadows, rapid cuts and earthy language surpass anything then being done in the U.S. and because of these, M has a timeless quality.

The film originally ran 117 minutes and was cut drastically for a 1960 re-release to just over 90.

8262161,5,B0016CSCQ0,"i recall seeing the fritz lang movie ""m"" many years ago on my local pbs station and enjoyed watching it very much, so i was already familiar with the movie when i bought it from amazon.  this is a story about a child murderer who is hunted by both the police and the criminal element.  the movie shows that even the criminal element looks down on child killers and pedophiles.  at one point in the movie, the child murderer gives these excuses about he's not responsible for his disgusing actions and behavior.  does the criminal get caught?  if so, by who, the police or the criminal element?  the ending shows what happens.",1317859200,,625,4.535714285714286

8262163,5,B0016CSCQ0,"A must-see for any film noir enthusiast.  The portrayal of the murderer is way before it's time, clearly showing the struggle between the two opposing sides of the main character.  Anyone who loves Peter Lorre (yeah, I know there's a few of us out there!) will love this movie.  His reaction when he realizes that he is a marked man is priceless... and it will be a long time before you'll be able to listen to ""The Hall of the Mountain King"" without getting chills.

This film is about a serial child murder who has killed 8 children in Berlin, Germany.  Otto Wernick plays Insp. Karl Lohman the officer tracking the murder.  Peter Lorre plays Hans Beckman a sociopath who uses insanty as a ruse.  The director Fritz Lang in this film shows how insane the legal defense of insanity is.  The serial child murder Hans Beckman could be declared insane spend a few years in an insane asylum.  Later, he is delcared sane and let out so he can murder more children.  This is a very well made film and it deals with a problem we still have.",1254182400,3,1034,4.423280423280423
8262164,5,B0016CSCQ0,"Probably the first sound masterpiece. Though it's one of the first to use the new technology, it doesn't feel like it, as the camera is fluid and expressive and the sound effects are utilized perfectly and are even essential to the story. Lang's direction is superb, amping up the suspense and terror by using the cinematography, lighting, and sound together to create a very tense and distinctive atmosphere. Peter Lorre is fantastic in what is really the lead role of the film, making us feel sympathy and pity for a horrific child-murderer. The combination of German expressionism, film-noir tendencies, and social commentary that Lang injects into the film makes for a brilliant and gripping work. Simply a terrific film all-around.",1253664000,2,736,5.141666666666667
8262165,5,B0016CSCQ0,"The first talky by Fritz Lang in 1930-31. This great master of silent movies tries his hand on this talking long feature and succeeds in many ways. First the pictures are so beautiful, so well framed and lighted that the visual fascination Fritz Lang was a master of in the past is till there full and powerful.

Second the actors are still acting as if they were voiceless, their body language being essential for the understanding of the action and the feelings. What's more long silent sequences give some density to the sound when it comes back and this sound is used in full expressivity, even in its imperfection as if it were the real sound we could hear in the street, muffled, discordant and with interferences from all around.

Fritz Lang even manages not to have the typical sound of a sound stage though the whole film was shot in a studio, that sound stage sound so typical of so many American films of the 1930s. Then Fritz Lang deals with a subject that was just plain out in his time and yet he manages to do the job with such delicateness and tactfulness that it looks deeply human though dealing with the worst possible crime and criminal, and the board of censors of his time let it go through.

But Fritz Lang manages to demonstrate how even that criminal will have to get a real defense, a real trial, justice in other words. Two visions of justice are thus contrasted: the justice that looks for some kind of vengeance, or at least a full retaliation, and the justice that is considering the real state of mind of the criminal and hence his responsibility.

This explains well why the Nazis will ban the film later: it entirely condemns the Nazi expedient form of what they would have called justice which was always designating some kind of cleaning up of society, expurgating of the anti-social characters, be they political, sexual, criminal, religious or racial. And that's where the film today takes a new value.

It becomes an allegory of what was to come. Hitler and the Nazis will be those who will authorize the underworld to take over and we must admit that they are more effective than the police in  such situations and they don't wait for the judicial process to go through.

The SS were the police, the court, the jury, the judge and the executioner, all of them in one body. In five minutes the mystery was solved and the criminal was eliminated, even if it was not a criminal but a Jew or a Communist, these facts being the worst crimes the Nazis could identify, crimes deserving immediate death. That's this visionary aspect of the film that is disquieting.

Did the Germans know what was coming? Probably. So why did they not stop it? That is THE question and a very difficult one at that. Historians will still be asking that question in a couple of centuries.
