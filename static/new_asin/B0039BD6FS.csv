8392027,5,B0039BD6FS,"I am an avid Schumann lover and have been collecting recordings of his music for many years. I believe I have collected recordings of all of his music so I was absolutely delighted to have purchased this DVD. Having already DVD's of The Scenes from Faust and Manfred, I was excited to come across this disc. The conductor knows this music by heart and does not need to look at a score. The soloists are admirable. The sound and video are perfectly fine. Do not hesitate to buy this disc if you are a Schumann lover.
PS I am waiting for  decent DVD of Genoveva, unfortunately only the execrable production with Harnoncourt is available now.",1421107200,,639,4.556521739130435
