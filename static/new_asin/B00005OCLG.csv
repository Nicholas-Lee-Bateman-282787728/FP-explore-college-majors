7948898,1,B00005OCLG,"REVENGE IN THE HOUSE OF USHER is Jess Franco's take on the classic Poe tale. As such, it bears no resemblance to the original story whatsoever. It stars Howard Vernon (AWFUL DR. ORLOFF, DR. ORLOFF'S MONSTER, ZOMBIE LAKE) as the insane Dr. Eric Usher. A visitor named Alan Hacker finds out about the doctor's eeevil experiments w/ life-after-death, and the women -test subjects- locked in his dungeon. Hacker winds up listening to Usher's long-winded explanation, complete w/ lengthy (we're talking about 30 minutes of recycled footage here!), unnecessary flashback sequences from the first ORLOFF film! This movie is lazy filmmaking at it's most ridiculous! Let's face it, Vernon isn't the most dynamic actor, and listening to him drone endlessly on about nothing, is like being staked to an ant hill! My god! DR. ORLOFF is a great movie, so I'll just watch that instead of this cinematic whale turd!...",1372723200,2,903,5.067114093959732
7948899,1,B00005OCLG,"I love Mr Jess Franco but this film was very boring and tame. I wouldnt really want anyone to watch it. No reason to watch again and no gore, nudity or excitement. Pick up only if you watch all his films like me and just have to know whats its all about.",1367452800,2,254,3.9038461538461537
7948900,2,B00005OCLG,"Anyone who has read my reviews or seen my listmania list knows im a huge fan of gothic horror. As for this one, save your money for something better. The dubbing was horrific and i had a hard time understanding what the characters were saying. The movie was hard to follow (perhaps because i couldn't understand what was being said) and very slow moving. It was very hard to get through this one.",1013731200,5,396,4.438356164383562
7948901,4,B00005OCLG,"Typical Fanco film - castles, chained women, mad doctors, ghosts, lots of atmospheric photography. The story is an insane cross between ""House of Usher"", and the Orloff films (And does re-use some Orloff footage for flashbacks.) The film looks very nice, with plenty of colour and fantastic scenery shots. Not one of Franco's best, but atmospheric and entertaining.",1006646400,15,365,5.310344827586207
7948902,1,B00005OCLG,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! do not le the title fool you this film has nothing to do with zombies. i rented this movie under its alternate title ""Revenge in the House of Usher"" cause i knew it was alzo titled as ""Zombie 5."" i thought it would ave been better than it's follower ""Zombie 4:Virgin Among the Living Dead"" by was i wrong. if you ever see this ovie under this title or th other titl ""Revenge in the House of Usher"" RUN! unless you like movies with meaningless plots,horrible acting, the weakest blood and gore. then go ahead buy it but don't say i didn't warn you.",998006400,5,567,4.2592592592592595
7948903,1,B00005OCLG,"ignore this movie at all costs! ignore the title this movie hs nothing to do with zombies what so ever. its just a mix up of volent scenes put together in so many confusing orders. don't buy this movie unless you want the whole 'weird' zombie set. its code named tha because there's two sets of zombie films. this set is not the set to Lucio Fulci's masterpiece ""Zombie"" oh no it isn't. my advice ignore this [one] and move on.",997920000,3,427,4.283950617283951
