8092468,1,B000BTGY7S,Product said it was rectangular but I received oval one,1490832000,,55,4.6
8092469,5,B000BTGY7S,Tai Chi gets the kids moving in place.  Yoga has them quietly imitating objects and animals while stretching and bending.  A must have for PE in the classroom.,1292976000,,159,4.642857142857143
8092470,4,B000BTGY7S,Video teaches some body awareness and gentle activity.  Good for kids who are over-stimulated and need to relax and connect their brain and body again.  Our 6 year old likes it a lot and he seems more calm and focused after doing the workout.,1259971200,2,242,4.4772727272727275
8092471,5,B000BTGY7S,My kids love this video.  I wanted to get them something they could do twice a week for exercise.  It has kids doing the Tai Chi and Yoga workouts with the instructor. My kids do the exercises and it's like recess time for them.,1254614400,2,228,4.159090909090909
8092472,2,B000BTGY7S,I was expecting a very active video to help my child exercise while getting energy out. This video is more of a slow introduction to Tai Chi and other slow moving exercises.,1162857600,12,173,4.4375
