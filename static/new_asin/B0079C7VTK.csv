But now I'm ready to continue to see what happens to Tanya & the wives, and they do not make the DVDs for my region. That's so not fair. I fell in love with this series when it was on BBC America. All five seasons+ Footballers Wive$ Overtime, with Tanya's sister continuing the drama you can't turn away. Now I want to finish my collection, and I can't. This is an unhappy ending to a fabulous show. So sad!!!",1496275200,,489,4.157894736842105
