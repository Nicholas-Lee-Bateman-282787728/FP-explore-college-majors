3669632,4,B001KVZ6HK,"You don't have to be someone who has read literally thousands of comic books, and had the nerdy arguments about whether Thor could shatter Captain America's shield with a well-struck blow from his hammer, Mjolnir, to understand just how awe inspiring a movie like Marvel's The Avengers is. That type of person describes me to a tee, but even if that wasn't the case, seeing the likes of Captain America(Chris Evans), Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) and Thor(Chris Hemsworth) all together in one film is enough to make anybody start quoting Joe Biden: ""This is a big effing deal!!!!"". The Avengers puts any fanboy fears to rest, and gets the geek juices goin' in a way no other superhero film has ever done. So why even bother trying to be subtle about this? The Avengers is flat out incredible! It is the jaw-dropping, powerhouse comic book movie we all hoped it would be and more!

Marvel deserve a ton of credit for the amount of time and precise care they've put into building to this point, properly stoking the fires of the fanbase when necessary, but also playing coy as they dropped hints about where the film might go. They've been building to this moment since we were introduced to the billionaire genius, Tony Stark, back in 2008's Iron Man, where everybody surely remembers that heart stopping moment when cool as ice Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) turned up talking about the 'Avengers Initiative'. As perfect of a job as they did introducing us to the many heroes who make up The Avengers, the smartest move Marvel made, by a very large margin, was in hiring Joss Whedon as director and co-writer. It's largely in part due to him and his technical brilliance, goofy humor, and obvious love for these characters that makes The Avengers the peerless film it turned out to be. Anybody could have come on board and churned out a great looking film with awesome, wide-scale special effects, but few have that intimate knowledge of these characters and how they relate that Whedon clearly has. He was like a kid in a candy store, and all the lollipops were shaped like the superhero favorites from his childhood.

A complaint that has been lodged against the film by some is the simplicity of the plot, but those people fail to understand just how necessary that is to accommodate for so many characters who many folks don't know all that well. Most people have no clue who Maria Hill(Cobie Smulders) is, or why she's important in the larger scheme of things. They don't know why Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has such a mad on for his brother, Thor. These things must be addressed in a way that everyone can understand, and to make room for the inevitable, and desperately wanted sequels. Can we get a fast track on those, please? The irony that such a simple but perfect plot could have been written by Zak Penn, the guy who gave us the convoluted mess that was X-men 3, isn't totally lost on me.

The film starts out with an image of the Tesseract, and if you don't know what that is don't bother stressing out. It's also known as the Cosmic Cube, and was the MacGuffin of Captain America: The First Avenger, basically a mystical object with unlimited power. It's one of those items that is so insanely ludicrous in what it could do, that in movies like this it never actually does anything. People just fight over it. Nick Fury and the spy guys at S.H.I.E.L.D. have it, and Loki wants it back to become the all-powerful ruler he thinks himself to be. Setting his sights on their HQ, Loki cuts a destructive path through Fury's forces, stealing the Tesseract and possessing the minds of agent Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye(Clint Barton), and Dr. Erik Selvig(Stellen Skarsgard). With the country now at war from a super-powered threat, Fury is forced to try and pull together all the heroes he knows to combat the threat. Good luck with that. But wait...how can Loki possibly stand against the combined might of The Avengers all by himself? Easy. By employing the alien Chitauri to be his back-up. There's a perfectly calibrated, comical yet intense verbal throwdown between Loki and Tony Stark that sums up their characters on the nose. To sum it up: both are pompous asses.

One of the trademarks of The Avengers is the combination of volatile personalities, and it quickly becomes apparent that they are their own worst enemy. A team made up of loners with their own personal agendas, conflict is unavoidable, and Whedon mines it for all that it's worth. Iron Man's flashy, indulgent personality rubs the modest, conservative Captain America the wrong way. Actually, Iron Man doesn't seem to get along with anybody, brawling with Thor and trying to provoke Bruce Banner into revealing his meaner, greener side. Whedon does a fantastic job of giving everyone their moment to shine, especially the characters who could have easily been lost in the shuffle: Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye.  In fact, Black Widow is the catalyst for much of what happens in the film's opening hour, tracking down Banner and revealing her deep, personal feelings towards Hawkeye. Having him taken over by Loki was a smart move, as it gives his character a reason to stand out from the pack....besides looking really cool with a bow and arrow.

The biggest stand out amongst the cast is a new addition, and that's Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. Marvel has been trying to get the Hulk perfect for years, starting with Erica Bana in Ang Lee's underrated 2003 film, then with Edward Norton in 2008's The Incredible Hulk. Both were successful in their own way, but Ruffalo hits the nail right on the head in every respect. What Norton and Bana missed was that they tried to play Banner as too depressed, too passive. That has never been the character. He's a guy who understands his rages, and the nervous ticks he shows, such as his inability to ever be completely still, aren't so much for his own sake as they are out of concern for everybody else. Some of the film's best moments come as Banner and Stark, two technological and scientific marvels, banter back and forth in a language way too smart for anybody to totally understand. Plus, this version of the Hulk is just a heck of a lot more fun, as Whedon builds up the anticipation to his inevitable transformation in much the same way he toyed with us in The Cabin in the Woods. When the crap finally hits the fan and the Jade Giant emerges, he's the destructive force of nature Banner had done such a marvelous job warning everybody about.

Whedon adds all the little touches that you know he's been dying to show on the silver screen for ages. One that fanboys will appreciate is the fate of the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, always the first casualty of any major event. And you know, as we see the entire team locked in an enclosed office, bickering like schoolchildren, that Whedon has been dreaming up exactly how that little family squabble would go for years. There are so many ingenious moments that to list them all would take longer than the film's 2 1/2 hour runtime. Nobody balances humor with genuine stakes better than Whedon does.

As gifted as Whedon and Penn prove to be with the dialogue, the special effects also prove to be something extraordinary. Cities get destroyed, powers fly, and Hulks smash with reckless abandon. In IMAX 3D it's especially impressive. Whedon has been a director capable of making the most with sometimes limited resources, and given the ample backing of Marvel and Paramount, he's free to cut loose, and it's an opportunity he simply doesn't waste.

Ok, so this is basically a gush fest, but that's exactly what The Avengers inspires. There will be other superhero movies coming out this year, and they all will scratch a very specific kind of itch. The Avengers is the summer movie to end all summer movies, and probably the only one we'll see this year that not only meets our lofty expectations, but far and away surpasses them!",1335916800,3,7936,4.732465654374548
3669633,5,B001KVZ6HK,"And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's Mightiest Heroes found themselves united against a common threat! On that day, The Avengers were born, to fight the foes no single Super Hero could Withstand!

This is the event comic fans have eagerly awaited. The culmination of every Marvel movie over the last several years...The Avengers

When Loki, the maniacal adopted brother of Thor returns (having seemingly survived his fall from the Bifrst Bridge in ""Thor"") he delivers an Ultimatum to humanity, surrender or die. To combat this worldwide threat, Nick Fury the director of S.H.I.E.L.D (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) enacts The Avengers Initiative. The Team consists of Living Legend Captain America, Thor Loki's foster brother and Thunder God, The Invincible Iron Man, Master Archer Hawkeye, Super Spy The Black Widow and The Hulk strongest hero there is.

Loki desires above all else, the Tesseract a sort of power source a Cosmic Cube (that once powered the Jtunn Casket of Ancient Winters) S.H.I.E.L.D came into possession of after Red Skull's defeat during World War II (Captain America: The First Avenger). Loki along with his Chutauri Alien Army plan to use the power of the Tesseract to enslave humanity.

Can the Avengers defeat not only the invading Chutauri Army, but a crazed Norse God bent on conquest?",1335744000,2,1373,5.171171171171171
3669634,5,B001KVZ6HK,"This is the film we knew was coming before they even started to make it. The frequent cameo appearances by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in all the films hinted at the coming of this film. They goofed, and didn't introduce Fury in the first Iron Man (unless you watched post credits) and forced us to sit through a cliche filled second one so they could fit in Jackson and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson).

Loki, with ""ancient knowledge and a new purpose"" has returned (""the door opens from both sides"") and absconds with the Tesseract, a device of unlimited power. Loki is bent upon world destruction/domination. Nick Fury and the Black Widow travel the world to assemble a crack team of superheroes to save the planet. It is during this time we get a brief re-introduction of the characters: The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner introduced in ""Thor"") and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Thor comes in later. He sees the Loki issue as a family problem and doesn't want the Avengers butting in. This creates a brief three sided fight.

The film also boasts some good dialouge and many decent one liners especially for those who relish a good chiamus:

Captain America: ""Wait. We have to plan our attack.""
Iron Man: ""I have a plan. Attack.""

The production recreates the quirky characterizations. Iron Man is an egomaniac. Hulk is the reluctant hero. Black Widow is ever confident. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is sexy and intelligent. Captain America is the naive patriot. Lou Ferrigno (who else could it be?) is the voice of a larger Hulk than in the past. As expected, having a villain with the strength of the gods is not enough. There has to be some minor infighting due to personality differences.

The film includes a good blend of action, comedy, great special effects, and has a fairly decent plot at that. It does help to have seen the other films, especially ""Thor"", but it is not a requirement if you have some inkling of the superheroes mentioned.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Minor profanity (SOB).",1335571200,96,2098,4.813888888888889
3669635,5,B001KVZ6HK,"I don't know whether you should call them ""IT"" or ""They"". They( it) are so MARVELous!!! I thought when you put all the superheroes together, they would steal the main show from each other. Boy.... I was wrong! They actually form ONE BIG SUPERHERO as a TEAM especially towards the end of the movie "" The Avengers"". My heart was pounding at the end of how they managed to pull their remaining resources together to fight Loki, the ""vengeful"" & slicky half-brother of Thor.

So if you plan to watch this film, you'd better make sure you have watched ""Thor"" before this. It is really remarkable how Marvel Studio have creatively linked all the main characters together and you can actually relate them back to their individual movie.

3669744,5,B001KVZ6HK,"My daughter is in 1st grade and has been getting into superhero movies.  It started with Wonder Woman (a DC flick) and then somehow she saw Spiderman: Homecoming, I don't remember the details that led to that.  But if she's going to get into the MCU, she needs to watch them in order to get all the background and context.

Leading up to the Avengers, we needed to see Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America.  We also did Iron Man 2 as that came before the Avengers but we skipped the Hulk since it had another actor and didn't have an origin story, didn't really contribute like the others did.

So here we were, after all these movies building up to this one, finally letting her see the Avengers.  I remember seeing this one in 3D in the theater and knew it was a great movie, but would she think the same?

The answer was yes.  She loved it.  This was her first intro to the Hulk but she picked up on him okay.  In fact, the scene where Hulk bashes Loki around like a rag doll is one of her favorites, cracks her up every time.  This movie also warmed her up more on Captain America.

From a ""family friendly"" perspective, it's a little annoying that all these movies (not just MCU) feel the need to slip in one or two profanities just to cement a PG-13 rating.  I mean, I'm not profanity-adverse but I'm not in a hurry to expose a 6 year old to that language yet (not to mention her 3 year old sister watches them with her).  So far, though, they don't seem to have made an impression - I did tell her ""if you hear any grownup language, just ignore it"", for whatever that was worth...

Speaking of her younger sister, the Avengers is her favorite superhero movie by far.  Instead of just being along for the ride, she wanted to watch the ""Vengers"" again and again day after day until even her older sister was starting to get tired of it.

Overall a winner.",1517788800,6,1859,4.250712250712251

3669797,5,B001KVZ6HK,"Excellent movie that brought Iron Man, Thor Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow for a huge cinematic event that had never been done before! The Avengers was a treat, and how all the characters, with distinctly different personalities to work together to fight Thors brother Loki(who if you watched the end credit scene was given a special staff by Thanos-who finally makes his way to earth next year in Avengers Infinity War). It glued together the individual movies that built to this, amazing! And Marvel continues to pepper there movies with credit scenes that give you clues on future movies! Anyway, Avengers is just a classic that my grandkids in the future will watch. Marvel REALLY took off with this movie, and their shared universe, The Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU) has continued to expand from here with more Marvel superheros. Just an amazing thing!

Not enough story, too much destruction.  Found myself just muting the fight scenes, or skipping them entirely.  In order to fit in all of the characters, they failed to develop any of them, even Loki.  Coulson was the only one you could feel for.  If all you're looking for is testosterone, this is your movie.",1504224000,,472,4.765432098765432

3669898,5,B001KVZ6HK,"We watched this at the theater in IMAX 3D, so watching a Blu ray of this film at home had a lot to measure up to. I would say that it was quite acceptable. We watched it on a 55"" LG with passive 3D. The image was crisp and the 3D added, in my opinion, to the viewing experience over watching a standard Blu ray ... and I think that standard Blu rays normally look pretty good.

I doubt I have to fill anyone in about the subject of this movie. It takes several Marvel super-heroes who have all had their own films leading up to this and puts them in one epic package. True to the Marvel taste, for most of the film they do not get along well with each other, but come together when it counts to fight an exhausting and dangerous battle against seemingly impossible odds. But what else are super-heroes supposed to do? LOL

The acting is convincing, and there are quite a few moments of humor to give you a break from the more serious tone of the movie (a defect in the otherwise brilliant movies in the new Batman series).

The sound in this presentation is simply outstanding. I don't remember another film which has driven my subwoofer more powerfully or effectively. The rest of the sound comes through powerfully and crisply too. There is no problem with level balancing between the score, the sound effects and the dialogue.

If you like super-hero movies, this very well may be the best one ever released.",1503446400,2,1411,4.394636015325671

3669903,5,B001KVZ6HK,"I really can't add too much to the superlatives already expressed.  Greatest superhero movie ever made?  Check.  Best casting of a superhero ever?  Check (Downey).  Most fun villain in the history of - maybe everything?  Check.

I walked into Meijers one day after work, blissfully unaware of any of the Marvel films made since the Toby MacGuire Spider Man movies.  There on a large flat screen TV was Hawkeye shooting his exploding arrows at the SHIELD helicarrier.  I watched about 30 seconds, found a kid in the department and asked him what is this, he said it's THE AVENGERS.  I bought the Blu-Ray and my wife and I were watching it immediately after dinner.  Next day went out and bought all the predecessor films, and we've been hooked ever since.  They are ALL good - well except for Doctor Strange, which I wish would just go away.  Hulk, Thor, Cap, Ant Man, Guardians... all awesome but the 2012 Avengers movie will be tough to beat for a long time.  And the recasting of Mark Rufalo as Bruce Banner - genius move.  Not sure the story behind it, but even though it's a good movie in its own right, Edward Norton as Banner... just isn't weird enough.  Rufalo is perfect.  He sure isn't Bill Bixby, but I always thought of Bixby as Eddie's father and Tim O'Hara.  Rufalo is the perfect Banner, just as Downey is the perfect Iron Man.  The supporting cast all truly outstanding.  Every moment of this is fun.  Oh and there's Scarlett Johansson's ""interrogation"" scenes.  This is the Citizen Kane of superhero films.  Watch any portion of it... do like Ebert did with Kane, and randomly watch a scene, look for what you missed.  Did you see Steve pay off his bet?  And the outtakes and bloopers show just how much fun the cast had making this film.  It will be tough to ever do better, but I'm okay with it.  I've got all the others to watch, and I can watch Avengers as many times as I want.  Actually looking forward to running it on our new 60"" TV once we get everything back in place from re-flooring the living room.  This is in my all time top ten.",1502150400,,2060,4.447721179624665

While I felt Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger, while good, certainly didn't hold up as well as Iron Man, I'm glad I watched them before seeing the Avengers. Every hero gets their due credit and screentime. The chemistry, both while getting along and at each other's throats, had me invested well before the big New York battle.
Performances: While some stand out better than others, all done well and had me liking the heroes better than I did after their debut movies. Tom Hiddleston as Loki killed it much more than in Thor 1.
Action: Got me hyped up like I was 5 years old again. Honestly don't know how I would've done it any better.
Soundtrack: While Marvel is known for not having particularly memorable music, the Avengers theme is all I need. Powerful and heroic, it's likely the most recognizable music in the MCU thus far.

Overall, worth every one of these five stars.",1482624000,,939,4.6909090909090905

I cannot say avengers are good or not. on the one side, they can do protections but they can also do great destruction. do we really need this group of people to protect humans from high-tech dangers and some times alien dangers...but on another side, themselves are great weapons.
actually, i do believe we have such kind of groups, people are super armed and they do spying and elimination work... i know it is stupid, but  it is just what i imaged from the super hero movies..",1481155200,,768,4.446808510638298

After watching it I felt like the story was decent and it kept you entertained. That's what movies are supposed to do, entertain us. There was no nudity, but there were many brutal fights (not much blood, so don't expect it to be like Saving Private Ryan on the beaches of Normandy). Overall this isn't a movie I'd probably buy personally, but it was worth the rental and I'd maybe watch it again if it was free on Netflix or Amazon Prime later.",1473206400,,594,4.265486725663717

I wasn't sure where the Disc got packed off to in my move and I wanted to watch it with my daughter now that she is old enough for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Worth paying to rent what I already own! Avengers works on Every level.  The interrelationship of the heroes their internal conflicts on the team, great one liners and Tom Hiddleston.  Top notch movie and you don't need to watch any of the others first although if you have you get more subtext.  I suggest binge watching in their theatrical release order since there are easter eggs in each film to refer to the priors and the future films.",1472860800,11,658,4.368852459016393

3670400,5,B001KVZ6HK,Comes with all copies of the movie with so many formats. I never used the MP4 download code or w.e format but assume that it works wonderfully like the others. Very awesome to be able to bring the standard DVD to watch with others while also having the Blu-ray for watching with those who do. Preferred the 3d an unquantifiable amount more than I had in the movie theaters. Might have something to do with my Samsung and comfortable 3d accessory glasses but movie is stunning on Blu-ray  and would recommend for a collections or to test the capabilities. Can pick up a pair of active shutter glasses for relatively inexpensive. Don't forget to buy at least 2 but 3 always seems to be the right amount or magic number for watching with guests or friends.,1471305600,2,753,4.536764705882353

While it doesn't work as well with repeat viewings, even if you're only slightly familiar with the characters, there is a lot of fun writing, and popcorn action that will have you laughing and cheering (provided you're in a fun group).

3670448,5,B001KVZ6HK,"Fun, action-packed thrill ride based on comic books.  Don't look for anything deep or intense here.  Just good fun and excitement.  Some elements can be confusing if you have not seen others in series, but just sit back and enjoy--you can figure those things out when you watch other flicks.  Well cast with the superheroes showing complexities and insecurities of ""regular"" folks.  Well acted also, but none will receive Oscar nominations as this series in not classy enough for the Academy.  But if the box office/rentals/purchases matter, this series in hands down one of the best out there.",1468713600,,594,5.010204081632653

My biggest complaint is Cap's characterization here. He's such a butthead. What's up with his line about God? If you know the backstory you know he's extremely traumatized right now, but I wish they'd given us a little more about why he's being such a git. Thankfully he gets it together later.

There are four discs, but there are so many inserts from Disney and Marvel on top of the Music and DMA inserts that it's literally overstuffed.

The case doesn't lock closed anymore, so I'm really glad that it came with the dust cover, because that's all that's holding it together.

Otherwise, it's a great movie. Just thought it was worth noting.",1466899200,,592,4.5754716981132075

Also a good start to the steam of 'spin-off'movies and sequels.  Great special effects.  A decent storyline/plot.  Certainly teaches the teen-age fan base a lot about the ages old battle of Good -vs- Evil.  It's always nice to watch a movie where the Good Guys win.

3670595,2,B001KVZ6HK,"This is a very weird take on a classic British television show. While it retains some aspects of the television show : a convoluted plot by a villain bent on world conquest through the most confusing and self-defeating way possible, people wearing weird clothes for no particular reason; many of the choices are baffling. Scarlett Johansson, plays Emma Peel wonderfully. She fits into the classic black catsuit and keeps her dry British wits about her. But why did everyone call her Natasha? Also which character was supposed to be John Steed? None of them wore bowlers. At first, I thought Roberts Downey Jr. was playing Steed, but Steed would never dress up like a robot pimp. I also felt that the movie lost something from the original show when it was moved from London to New York.",1464825600,,786,4.744525547445256

He was almost prodded open by Stark and the rest yet he hid the 'big' guy trying so hard to keep him from humanity.  Fearing that brutal force within I felt moved by his own selflessness.

3670677,5,B001KVZ6HK,"Loved it. Actors were great, effects were great, scenes were awesome, action wasn't so crazy you couldn't enjoy the action, and the story was fun. There was a slight feeling that the movie had 6-hours worth of content crammed into 2 hours, but it didn't feel abridged. It seemed like there could have been more with Loki to drum up his agenda, and the attack on NY kinda felt like it was all happening on one city block (and therefore not much of a ""oh no the world's doomed"" sorta thing) but those are points that really take a back-seat to the overall movie.

Add the nostalgia of the characters to the modern special effects, mix in a superb all star cast, and all of these Marvel movies are absolutely fantastic.  The characters are true to their history and so well portrayed.  Solid work Disney, Marvel, and all involved!

I opted for the DVD instead of all of the super cool blu-ray and digital copy stuff because this was for my brother who lives over seas.  International movie watching is a little tricky depending on where you live, but he is able to watch DVDs.  Because of this, the price was fantastic.  How can you beat $6 for this great movie??

It arrived on time and was well packaged.  This was the perfect Christmas gift as he hadn't seen it and he had a few long flights ahead to return home after the holidays.

I highly recommend this film.  Our whole family loves it, including a 3 year old and a 5 year old.  One of the classics you can watch again and again and again!",1462752000,,970,4.35754189944134

This compilation of Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy an music is fine with respect to the first three aspects.  The disc copies played fine in my blu-ray player and regular DVD player. The downloading of the digital copy went fairly smoothly with a Mac and iTunes.  However, I'd have liked to get the actual soundtrack rather than ""music inspired by the Avengers"" with only one song that comes from the actual movie. Live to Rise is fine (ending credits) but that is the only song from the movie on this download. I might still have bought this set if I realized that, but I wish it had been clearer in the product description on Amazon. There is so much great music in that soundtrack - Captain America's theme, Black Widow's theme, the Avengers theme itself. Instead I got a lot of really screaming style rock & roll that I will never listen to again.

3670962,2,B001KVZ6HK,"initially I understood why so many people liked the film, but, as time has passed, my original feelings of disappointment and somehow feeling ""wronged"" by the film [that was promoted by the studio and fans alike as the ultimate fruition of super hero comics in cinematic form] held true.  I am an avid fan of comic-based films, but I'm also very critical of so many of them, and I find myself extremely critical of this film because of its shameless cash-grab on Marvel's part.  Had Iron Man not been as successful as it was, I feel this movie wouldn't have been made (Iron Man was a better film, but not by much).  Seeing an assemblage of interesting comic book characters is fraught with dangers of oversimplifying character development and plot, and The Avengers falls into both of these pits.  The plot is trite: super heroes unite to stop an evil force.  I wouldn't be so hard on this premise--it is more of a trope for fans of the genre whose importance can't be easily dismissed--if the major elements were at least more fleshed out.  Since the plot is very basic, it makes the flaws that much more glaring.  The clearest criticism I have are the stakes of the plot, which feel exceedingly contrived solely for the purpose of getting three characters from other, better executed Marvel films--Thor, Captain America, and the first two Iron Man films (none of which are very decent in themselves and cookie cutter versions of each other to some degree)--into one scenario so that the dynamics of the team can be explored.  The interpersonal relationships aren't even explored that much: quipping by no means necessarily create meaning character interaction.  Robert Downey Jr.'s Stark provides just enough irritation to the other characters to give an illusion that the team has a thoughtful structure of personal concurrences and conflicts.

The film's versions of Black Widow, Hawkeye, and even the Hulk are dilutions of their fairly rich source materials, and these three characters are shown as more as individual qualities masquerading as characters.  Black Widow appears to be nothing more than a solitary voice concerning team unity rather than a person with a history, despite the scenes that attempt to give her some degree of three dimensionality.  For this version of the Hulk, the director makes the false assumption that the audience is familiar with Ruffalo's specific incarnation of the character.  This would be okay, if there weren't so many Hulk movies and a need to distinguish the particularities of this Hulk's treatment.  The character, thus, acts as sort of a deus ex machina that is always in the wings but doesn't have much depth outside of being a plot-device, even in the hands of a very capable actor like Mark Ruffalo.  Hawkeye is virtually untouched in terms of development.  Aside from those characters, the three heroes with backstories established by previous films (Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor) are too informed by their previous respective film appearances.  The tension and chemistry that Whedon wants you to feel between these supposed major personalities simply isn't there.  When you think about it, the three major heroes aren't terribly different when you ignore the fact that they are taken from drastically different settings: each is faced with some sort of handicap that must be overcome, all three have a generic love story (fraught with fairly comparable degrees of difficulty) which motivates them, and none of them don't fit in with their surroundings.  So, the three characters who are supposed to provide the team with its major internal struggles aren't diverse enough as individuals to make their personal tensions all that endearing or believable.

Going back to my point about the stakes feeling weak, this is because the antagonism which unites the heroes to action has very little to offer in terms of originality.  Loki is recycled as the main villain, though a servant of Thanos, and is given the most generic evil army that I've yet to see on screen (at least the CGI Clone Troopers of Revenge of the Sith had bearing on the plot at large).  Hiddleston may play the role well, but his charm can't make up for the lack of challenge presented to the heroes.  Perhaps if they had introduced a threat that was more applicable to the immediate plot instead of merely being a way to give credence to the greater threat--which Marvel, and now Disney, plans on dragging out in order to cash in on virtually every character they feel can be put into a box-office contender--the plot's McGuffin (Loki's scepter) could have actually created a focal point for the confrontation between the protagonists and antagonist (I use the word singularly because there's essentially only one antagonist who matters for the purpose of this film).  Every conflict is so unevenly matched that there is no real question about the outcome when battle breaks out.  There is a protagonist character there to trump every antagonist, so there is no uncertainty about the outcome of confrontation.  Even Loki's confrontation with the Hulk is made boring by the predictability since Loki's power is so limited.  I feel that this film, along with almost all of the post-Iron Man Marvel adaptations, are trying to come across as an experimental approach to franchise story telling (as the film seems to imply): where, like detailed reading of comics, you need to be well-versed in the histories of characters and concepts in order to appreciate the refined nuances of the story.  There really aren't any refined nuances here, and it is very obvious that whatever unified vision for the future of this supposed epic saga of Marvel characters lacks a great deal of direction or appreciation for how this supposedly unique approach might evolve the comic elements instead of reducing them to so much fodder for corporate greed.  The phase approaches that have been announced seem less like the implied experiment with franchise story telling and more of an industrial awareness that fans of certain characters will pay to see them finally put on the big screen.  With the release of films like Guardian's of the Galaxy (the best of the Marvel movies by far), The Winter Soldier, and others, this first gathering of the Avengers seems like more of an expensive and long commercial rather than an installment, and what attention paid to this movie as a stand-alone film comes across as little more than the worst kind of unoriginal super hero narratives with an emphasis on fan service.",1454803200,,6519,4.9650735294117645

3671115,3,B001KVZ6HK,"Superhero movies tend to follow a formula thats so rigid as to be entirely predictable, and MAA is no exception to this rule. All the usual stuff is here including the bonhomie, action set pieces, and blockbuster effects. But MAA is elevated above most examples of the genre by Joss Whedons trademark wit, and to be honest I only watched this because he wrote it. There are some nice touches of humour along the way and they help mitigate the limitations of the format. Tom Hiddleston is well suited to his role as is the rest of the cast, with the exception of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth, both of whom are somewhat wooden. One thing that stuck me as I watched this movie is how lame some of the Marvel superheroes now seem. Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow in particular seem pretty feeble when compared to the Hulk, Iron Man etc., but I guess thats what comes of resurrecting such old franchises. Anyway, despite its flaws MAA is an entertaining movie and definitely one of the best in an increasingly crowded field. 3.5/5",1450396800,,1038,4.616216216216216

3671124,5,B001KVZ6HK,"I've always thought that Joss Whedon's productions and scripts were good but over-rated, good but not GRRRREAT the way all his fans say. This movie is an exception to my usual attitudes. Marvel's The Avengers is probably the best super-hero movie I've seen in a long time going all the way back to Richard Lester's Superman 2.

The first thing I liked is we don't have any tormented, self-conflicted superheroes in this movie. Each character has some kind of past conflict they need to confront, but Whedon keeps those revelations to a minimum. We certainly don't get anybody staring into a smashed mirror and asking ""Who am I?"" The focus is on the action and group dynamics.

The second thing I liked is Whedon's script. He's juggling many, many subplots. Though I had to watch the movie a second time to understand all the plot strands, it's amazing that the script is as organized and propulsive as it is. Whedon has always written snappy dialogue though with an unfortunate weakness for the so-called ""zinger:"" witty one-liners that are sometimes funny but never THAT funny. Whedon curbs his mere cleverness and delivers enjoyable dialogue that is either realistic or convincing (because, of course, there's nothing realistic about superheroes flying around on an airborne aircraft carrier...)

The third and final thing I liked is the combination of humor and SFX. These effects are astounding and astonishing in the best digital way, but Whedon's trademark humor prevents the action of the movie from turning into bone-crushing mayhem. I've always said that too few directors understand the difference between action and violence but in Marvel's The Avengers, Whedon definitely shows that he does understand that difference.

Admirers of Whedon's Firefly might notice similarities between Scarlett Johansson's character and another dangerous and curvaceous red-head from a Firefly episode entitled ""Our Mrs. Reynolds."" That one starred a very young Christina Hendricks as a similar kind of character. Just an FYI!",1449964800,,2019,5.222222222222222

3671131,2,B001KVZ6HK,"This is not smart like Iron Man. This is not gritty like Batman:
What sets this apart from the Fantastic 4?  Better actors.  It has no soul at its core and the longer the film goes, the more tiring it becomes.

Joss Whedon has not an ounce of original thought in his head on how to shoot an action scene, so he just takes big chunks of all the action movies that he has watched and mashes them up.  Its like a bad case of deja vu:
There is equal parts James Bond and Transformers when it comes to the action sequences.  Each scene seems like it has been played out so many times in every run of the mill action film, that boredom sets in.

There are only a handful of laughs and a majority of the best Tony Stark quip scenes are dragged out way beyond funny:
Robert Downey Jr. is his normal funny self as Tony Stark/Iron Man but director Joss Whedon didn't know when to reel him in, often letting his jokes and one liners fill full segments of dialog.

The common joke is this (minus Tony Starks scenes):
Set up.wait for it.wait for it..(sometimes punching and or kicking).wait for itPunchline..Complete with people laughing before the punchline because it was dragged out too long
Talk about lobbing it over the plate, each joke was set up with such clumsy predictability that many movie goers were saying the punchlines before they were said on screen.

The sets and green screen work is so stale that you will feel like you are inside a Dollhouse(crickets)
I searched each set looking for a natural tone, to feel like we could actually be immersed in something other than a green screen and fake buildings.  My search was fruitless and even some of the rooftop and flying scenes were really poorly done to the point of laughable.

Oh and why is Hawkeye in the movie?:
That same question could be asked about Black Widow, but it begs the question as to why the characters were added.  They didn't do much for the team and their story arcs were unexplained and also unimportant.

If you do not read The Avengers, it might not be all that interesting to watch:
I am sure that if I was a huge fan of the Avengers, I would have different feelings for this film because I would be so geeked to see them on screen that I could overlook all the flaws.  But why should these types of films only appeal to the fan boy?

The Captain America jokes get old as soon as they start telling them.  Then they go on for another hour and a half:
The Captain America schtick would have played better had they not gone to it over and over again.  Yes Joss, I get it he was frozen for 70 years so he doesnt understand all of the modern verbiage and technology.  Quit beating me over the head with it.

The spoon fed dialog portions of the film are far too many, the tantalizing action is far too few:
Never is this more apparent than at the end of the film.  Instead of letting the story dissolve naturally they decide to spoon feed you portions as if you hadnt watched any of the rest of it.  The ending was so poorly executed that it was hard to swallow the rest.

Because Follow That Bird is on netflix instant streaming:

The banter between Iron Man and the other characters is classic and amusing. My girlfriend had not seen the movie yet,  and she REALLY liked it as well. We both will be making references to this movie for months. Though it is not really MEANT to be a comedy, the parts that make you chuckle will stick with you for a while after the credits roll.

Recruited by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), the resurrected Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), ""Norse god"" Thor (Chris Hemsworth), scientist Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and secret agent Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), find themselves facing Thor's jealous foster-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who has gained--or rather regained--possession of the tesseract which originally served as the Red Skull's weapon during World War II, and by the way has also kidnapped several scientists and an American secret agent, super-archer (and Natasha's mentor) Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), using the artifact to dominate their minds.  With five very different characters thrown together in an impromptu team, conflict within the group as well as against the enemy is inevitable, especially since Thor considers the planet to be ""under my protection"" and Banner is struggling to keep his alter ego The Hulk from breaking out.  Meanwhile Loki, by the use of the tesseract, has assembled, or perhaps only recruited, an army of grotesque aliens who unexpectedly drop onto New York City through a rip in the sky above, and the Avengers (as Stark has named them) must put aside their personal differences and work together to defeat them.  Like all the recent Marvel flicks, this one is full of angst, personality conflict, and splendid special effects, and viewers who enjoyed the previous titles won't be disappointed.",1448841600,,2127,6.400696864111498

There is a lot of action combined some humor, and it is very fun seeing a group of superheroes brought together for a movie for all of them. It was the first movie this and it executed it perfectly. It is extremely entertaining, and i would recommend it to any Marvel fan! Of course, you'll have to start with Iron Man, and work your way up to it. That's something that I love about the movies. They are all connected and they make references to the other movies, which is only understandable through watching the other movies. All in all, it is a fantastic series of movies and i can't wait to see how the rest of the movies turn out.",1448668800,,693,4.297709923664122

3671201,4,B001KVZ6HK,"I was surprised how much I liked this action flick. I think Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson had a lot to do with it, and director Joss Whedon, and maybe that was enough. There was much more destruction than your average alien-invasion movie has, but like the old A Team tv show, it wasn't real violence. Thor's one good line was something like ""you're right about Loki--his actions aren't rational. But he is an Asgardian.""",1446940800,,432,4.697368421052632

3671222,4,B001KVZ6HK,"The Avengers is one of these rare movies where it lives up to all the tons of hype it has gotten! It has made over 1.5 billion dollars, and it has received high praise from both fans and critics. And the success of this movie is very well deserved! The really great thing about this movie doesn't come from all the action, humor or visual effects... It is to see all these characters interact with each other in one room! Joss Whedon truly was the man for the job, and he impresses once again with his ability to portray each character as meaningful as the other. Everybody counts! There isn't one hero, but six of them! And they are all relevant and meaningful, plus all their character development is superb... All of them! Whedon has my full respect!

The visual effects in this movie are out of this world! It really is spectacular and a joy to watch! The cinematography is likewise beautiful in this movie! But in the technical department all my praise and full respect goes to Alan Silvestri! His score for this movie blew me away! Especially, the ""Avengers Assemble"" tune! No gripes from me in the technical department!

As for the cast they are all terrific! Robert Downey Jr. is easily my favorite and probably the funniest in this movie! Mark Ruffalo makes the best Bruce Banner aka ""The Hulk"" to date, with a serious and human, yet comedic performance! Chris Evans is still quite good as Captain America. As far as performances go, this guy is probably the weakest. But he's still an awesome actor! Chris Hemsworth isn't a remarkable actor either, but he has nice charisma and fits the role as Thor! Scarlett Johansson is smoking hot and sexy, and much more relevant than she was in Iron Man 2! Jeremy Renner was just pure badass Agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye! Samuel L. Jackson was epic and badass in the role of Nick Fury! Tom Hiddleston isn't exactly a really strong or serious villain. Mostly he just feels like a comic relief. But Hiddleston can act, and he's got a few agonizing scenes! Stellan Skarsgrd and Cobie Smulders is also good in their supporting roles!",1446249600,2,2080,4.60377358490566

My Marvel's The Avengers 2  Disc Blu-ray/DVD combo came without the blu-ray movie, only the features in blu-ray & the DVD.  So I only have the dvd of the actual movie after paying for the blu-ray combo.

Next, I need the subtitles and the dvd only displays less than half of any of the dialogue regardless of what screen size displayed - in other words, its not just cut off of the bottom of the screen - more than half of any spoken sentence is not there at all in subtitles.

How can a Disney company put out such shoddy product for such high prices and still get away with it?  Shocked & disappointed, to say the least.",1440201600,2,700,4.265151515151516

3671606,5,B001KVZ6HK,"The Avengers
 At last the winter movie doldrums are over and we have the first mega blockbuster of the summer, a little early as it turns out because the summer season is not due for a few weeks yet.  This is a full-on four and a half saw blade action super stupendous success.  This is tremendous entertainment on every checkmark of interest to the movie going public.  The direction is deft and crisp, the performances inspired and the writing imaginative and intelligent.  And all this from comes from heroes invented for the pages of Marvel Comics.
 The producers gave movie genius Joss Whedon $220 million to make a huge, colorful, loud and above all, an interesting action-fantasy-adventure film.  Whedon has directed only one other Hollywood film, the cult favorite Serenity.  Serenity was the big screen spin off of the Sci-fi TV series Firefly, also directed by Whedon.  He is known for his well drawn characters, and director brings this talent to The Avengers.
 Chris Evens, Captain America, had his own movie last year, and the Whedon directed version of his character is superior to the first incarnation.  Ditto for Chris Hemsworth as Thor.  His acting cant have gotten so much better in the year between his appearance as Thor in the stand-alone movie of that name and The Avengers.  Whedon just asked more of him and got it.  To be fair, Whedon also wrote the script for The Avengers and gave both Evens and Hemsworth more interesting things to do.
 But Mark Ruffulo is also more interesting to watch as Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk than any previous Hulk.  Scarlett Johansson plays a muted, introspective Black Widow whose main talent turns out to be as a very subtle interrogator, often done just before acrobatically beating up assorted bad guys.  Robert Downey Jr.-Iron Man-could not improve on his earlier performances but he certainly keeps up his excellent record.  Tony Stark-Iron Man reveals a depth of character that his fans always knew was there, but his wise cracking persona never revealed.  Gwynth Paltrow reappears as Tony Starks girlfriend Pepper Potts, in two too quick near cameos.
 Only Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker) and Samuel L. Jackson (most movies made in the last decade) put in less than grand acting.  Renner wasn't asked to do much, so he didnt.  Jackson might just be tired, he seemed to be somewhere else, counting his money perhaps, and not paying attention to his character.
 But the hidden gem among the actors is Tom Hiddleston as Loki.  For an actor to convincingly play a Norse God without slipping over into self parody is difficult enough.  Hiddleston pulls it off, but Loki is also nuts to top it off.  We believe in the crazy deity completely, at least for the length of the movie.
 Also featured are Stellan Skarsgard, the voice of Paul Beltany and a quick take of Marvel creator Stan Lee.
 The clever but not over clever writing is also from movie genius Joss Whedon.  He wrote the script for Toy Story as well as Serenity and several other Hollywood films.  Between the writing and the directing the small touches that make a film both memorable and fun are due to his imagination.  (The special effects are fine but support rather than dominate the movie.)
 The PG-13 rated film runs two hours and 22 minutes.  It has taken in an astonishing $642 million worldwide.  This is movie making at its superlative best and has a shot at becoming a billion dollar movie.  Everybody will want to see it and most likely will.  Id like to see it again right now.",1437264000,,3506,4.76578073089701

3671765,4,B001KVZ6HK,"While the Dark Knight with Christian Bale is possibly the best superhero movie of the 21st century, this first installment of the group of Marvel heroes known as the Avengers is a decent addition to the canon. Unlike other groups of superheros, such as the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, several of the Avengers were previously superheros in their own right in previous incarnations. The oldest is Captain America, who first appeared in the 1940's and fought against the Axis Powers during World War II. Both Iron Man and the Wasp appeared previously in Marvel's ""Tales to Astonish"" in 1962, and Thor appeared first in Marvel's ""Journey into Mystery"" also in 1962. The Hulk like Captain America appeared previously in his own comic book in 1962. Like the original comic book published in 1963, this film of the Avengers has them battling Thor's adopted and wayward brother, Loki, who are part of a race of beings called the Asgardians.

The film begins with American scientists working on a strange cube-shaped artifact, the Tesseract, which seems to have come from another dimension. We later learn it was discovered in the ocean. Nick Fury, a kind of CIA-agent superhero in the Marvel Universe (played by Samuel Jackson), heads the operation in a secluded compound which would give the Pentagon a run for its money. The Tesseract appears to have powers beyond the comprehension of the mere mortals who can't stop working on the darn thing. Of course that doesn't stop them from playing with something out of their league. Sort of the SF equivalent of the Rings from the ""Lord of the Rings"".

However, instead of taming the cube, the scientists inadvertently open a kind of portal to another dimension, the realm of Asgard, the world where Thor hails from. And out pops Loki, replete with a grin which would make Medusa turn to stone. The grin alone let's us know from the get-go the baddie of the story. He also wields a magical spear/sword thingie which either turns you to mush or makes you one of his zombie-minions. Like a boot squashing insects, Loki makes mince meat out of the operatives and their security, hypnotizes a few, not the least of which turns out to be the Green Arrow, grabs the Tesseract and then melts down their entire complex. All within less time then it takes to order and receive a cup of coffee at your local coffee shop.

Nick Fury engages the Avenger Initiative to bring the members together. Gradually, each of the superheros who will make up the Avengers appears, each engaged in some sort of situation which defines their character and their abilities. I thought that each of their situations were enough to let us know who they were and what kind of powers they have without dwelling on it too much. Eventually, Iron Man, Captain America, the Black Widow, and the Hulk are summoned to S.H.I.E.L.D., their headquarters a kind of flying aircraft carrier.

Their plan is to capture Loki and find the Tesseract. Natasha, a.k.a. the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and Captain America (Chris Evans) accomplish the first goal relatively easily when Loki infiltrates a party of the upper-crust in Stuttgart, Germany. At first he gets a whole crowd of Germans on their knees until Captain America stops the show. While on their way back, Thor comes flying out of the sky from Asgard and grabs Loki from out from under Iron Man. At first Thor and Loki have their deep discussion, avoiding such topics as the weather. Then Iron Man comes back on the scene, and he begins battling with Thor, contending he should stay out of their dilemma. Captain America interrupts their fight, and eventually Loki is taken to S.H.I.E.L.D. which appears to be where Loki wants to be, and Thor accompanies them.

For me, this is where the fun really begins. When the members come together with their prisoner, they appear at odds with one another. The Iron Man, out of costume, begins a kind of rhetorical one-up-man-ship with Captain America. And the heroes begin taking different sides. Dr David Banner (aka the Incredible Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo when he isn't green) sides with Iron Man while Captain America and Thor appear to be at odds with everyone, although Nick Fury tries desperately to keep everything civil. We begin to learn this is part of Loki's plan, even though he is held captive. And yet he seems strangely complacent as if everything is working to his plan. From there, everything literally begins to unravel...

A great very entertaining installment in the Marvel Universe of 21st century films. All the cast members are terrific, but the best and most interesting lines, not to mention the most memorable moments, are between David Banner (the Hulk) and Iron Man. Captain America is just how you expect him, righteous in the morality department but rather one-dimensional in the rhetorical department. The only shortcoming I thought was the character of Nick Fury, who seemed like he needed a few more off-color lines, like Jackson's previous character in ""Pulp Fiction"". He seemed just a little too straightforward. The ending is foreshadowed somewhat in the middle but it all works. Definitely a must for Marvel fans.",1435449600,,5185,4.873015873015873

This wretched fad of superhero movies is just that: wretched.

The outcome is never in doubt; therefore it lacks any suspense. It's SFX eye candy from start to finish. And even if one of the superheroes did get killed off, they'd just bring him back in the sequel. In not one of these flicks will the movie ever end with the Bad Guys putting all The Avenger's decapitated heads on pikes shortly before wiping out humanity.

And maybe even worse, this movie, like others of its ilk, flagrantly violates any internal rules that it might start out with. Need to get out of a bad situation? Just make up some heretofore unknown gizmo or suddenly put some other good guy character on the scene whom we had no idea was anywhere near, etc.

One of these flicks, once a year, would be fun. But at this point, if you go to see all of them, it must be like choking to death on your favorite candy bar.",1433894400,5,940,4.23463687150838

3671895,3,B001KVZ6HK,"I am only rating the product, not the movie. I was gifted this product by a relative.

The product comes as shown, however I was a little bit dissappointed because the ones in the store come with a plastic case on top of the normal Blu-Ray case. Not a big deal, but does make it a little bit less asthetically pleasing compared to all the other Marvel movies I own that come with an additional sliding plastic case.

I have a Macbook, and it runs perfectly. I opened the Blu-ray case to find the little sheet of paper stating which website to go to download my digital copy. Unbeknownst to me, there was a digital copy disc, hidden behind the DVD included in this package. The website was AvengersAssembleOffers.com, and it looks completely authentic. I entered the code in the large box, and the page transferred me to another page, stating that I *must* answer all of the fields below in order to redeem my offer. I provided my birth date, first name, postal code, and email address.
It then stated I would recieve an email confirmation.

I waited for the email confirmation, which never came. I went back to the page, only to have my Mac freeze, and move to another page (I was only one the Avengers Assemble website). It was completely authentic looking, and requested to do an immediate scan, stating my computer had just been infected with a virus from the last website I had visited. I allowed it to (the website name was macbookhealth or something like that. My macbook listed it as a trusted site) scan, and it came up with a warning my Macbook had contracted the Tapsnake viurs. The solution was to download Macbook Keeper, an online app. This was an immediate red flag, and I researched this so called virus only to find that it is completely bogus, and Macbook Keeper is a fraudulent and malicious software. Beware!

The reason I link this to the Avengers combo pack is because a) I was only on the AvengersAssembleOffers.com website listed in the digital copy pamphlet, b) my Macbook stated that it was from the last website visited (AvengersAssembleOffers.com).

I have downloaded numerous Marvel movies, but none of them have ever been with this website. Usually, it is from the Marvel website. I reccomend using only the disc included to download your digital copy, and be wary of anyother sites besides the Marvel website.",1433721600,,2339,4.681265206812652

Although I was a huge comic book fan as a youngster, and I do enjoy a good action flick (Blow stuff up, keel da baddies - Yay!) I didn't get into the movies originally.  I think I was put off by the remake upon remake of the Supermans and Batmans that just keep coming, and saw the Marvel movies as more of the same old thing.  I am happy to admit the error of my ways.

I have started watching the films in a chronological order - ie, Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and just finished The Avengers.

If I ever knew it from before my mother threw out my comic books the day I left for boarding school, I've forgotten. But these are both well-written ensemble yarns about distinctive characters who've been really well cast.

3671969,5,B001KVZ6HK,"I've begun to get tired of all the Marvel movies because they were feeling formulaic.  But I have a friend who was so excited for The Avengers he could hardly stand it, and his enthusiasm was contagious, so we wound up seeing the movie together.  I'm glad I let him talk me into it because it was great.

Obviously, they've been building toward this movie for a while now with the other movies they've been releasing.  After all, this movie includes Robert Downey, Jr. and Iron Man/Tony Stark, Chris Evans as Captain America/Steve Rogers, and Chris Hemsworth as Thor.  It assumes you know a little bit about the characters already, so I was glad I had seen them.  This was especially true of Thor because that movie is the most directly involved in what happens here.  You could just jump in here and still enjoy it, but to fully get what happens here, it will have helped to see those previous movies.

S.H.I.E.L.D., an international peace keeping organization, has found a cube of energy and they are trying to figure out how to turn it into a new power source for Earth.  But that's before Loki (Tom Hiddleston) shows up from another dimension and takes it, destroying their research base in the process.

Now they have a crisis on their hands.  While Loki tries to use the cube to create a longer connection to another dimension so he can bring an army to destroy Earth, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D., begins to assemble a collection of superheroes to protect Earth.  The team includes CaptainAmerica, Iron Man, Thor, Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo/Computer), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).  Will they be able to defeat Loki?

I think one reason I liked this movie is that in many ways it felt like a sequel instead of a first movie.  That's where those previous individual superhero movies come in - they've set up the majority of these characters already so we already know who they are.  Yes, we need to assemble the team, but that's actually rather short, so then we can start with the actual story.

The story is definitely strong.  The movie is well over two hours long, and I never got restless.  There are several great action scenes that really do show off all the characters to their best.  I did feel the climatic battle was a bit long, but that's my only real complaint.

What really impressed me was how, in the midst of the story and the action, we got character development for all the Avengers as well.  Frankly, I thought we got more character development here than we did in some of the previous individual movies.  Not being a comic book guy, I wasn't familiar with Black Widow and Hawkeye before this film, and I enjoyed those characters that felt I got a bit of a feel for them here.  Honestly, I would love a solo movie with Black Widow; I just loved that character.

Then there's the humor.  This is definitely a Joss Whedon movie.  While I have a major beef in how he ends his TV shows (Buffy, Angel, and Serenity are his three strikes), I love his sense of humor and snappy one liners.  This movie had several lines and scenes that made the full theater I saw this with laugh hysterically.  There are many great lines.  This mix of humor helped make the movie for me.  Honestly, I'll admit that Joss's involvement as writer and director is probably why I loved this movie so much since characters and humor have always been his strengths.

The actors are all great here.  The performances kept me engaged and helped bring those characters to life.

And the movie is filled with special effects.  Personally, I bought what I saw on screen.  That's hardly surprising for a big budget movie in the days of computer graphics.

As with the other recent Marvel movies, it's worth staying through the credits.  There are two scenes to watch.  Many found the second scene to be pretty funny, but I didn't get it.  And the first?  It might be setting up the inevitable sequel.

The Avengers is indeed a summer blockbuster movie, and that's a good thing in my book.  It's fun and entertaining - everything a movie should be.",1432684800,,4106,4.60551724137931

Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a rag-tag team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from the demi-god Loki and his army.

What did I think?

Half an hour of exposition followed by two hours of rollicking comic action. Great fun. Some minor problems here and there but the ride is so much fun you simply don't care.

Mark Ruffalo steals the show as the Hulk and it seems inevitable that Joss Whedon will get a greenlight for a sequel. And perhaps Ruffalos performance means yet another Hulk movie?",1431561600,,546,4.540816326530612

3672058,5,B001KVZ6HK,Finally get to see the biggest Marvel heroes on a Blu Ray screen,1431388800,,64,4.0
3672059,5,B001KVZ6HK,"I just loved this movie and am in agreement with all the 7,000 plus reviewers here. I did see it in IMAX 3D and it was amazing. I could clearly here the dialogue all throughout the movie, so I don't know if the reviewers that say they couldn't hear it are deaf or going. The audio to me was crystal clear on my electronics and in the Theater.  Yep, that's it. The equipment used so that audio is at a good mix of dialogue and sounds. I had no problems with it and found it quite easy to follow. Yes, there was a plot, if you have seen the other Marvel movies prior to this one you'll know it was leading up to this point, at least for now.  If you haven't at least seen THOR or IRON MAN  you are really going to feel lost. For those of you, like me, that have seen all the Marvel movies prior to this release, you know exactly what is happening, so character development for the individuals is already there in form. None of them have actually worked together as a team, so don't expect a harmonious balance at first, but once everyone got to know each other, I think the team did well and Capt. America was able to lead the team in the defense of NYC.
Loki plays the baddie here coming to Earth hoping to rule it after being cast out of Asgard, basically. He's met with two of Earth's heroes and has to surrender, for the moment. Thor makes his entrance following Loki. How Thor knew where Loki was on the SHIELD aircraft is still unknown to me. Does he have a cosmic ""jedi"" feeling he can find his brother when he is near? I don't know. Thor knows the Teseract is still on Earth and has the potential threat of doing major damage to everyone. So, the goal or plot of the story is to take back the Teseract from Earth and get it back to Asgard where it can safely be stored in the Vault.
Loki has other plans and is basically enlisted by the villain Thanos to do his dirty work, this time. Loki and the army of Chitari (may not be spelled right) are going to try and defeat Earth's mightiest heroes. (Wait, where's Spiderman when you need him?) lol
All things don't go as planned as he is threatened by IRON MAN as to what is about to happen. Loki balks and starts ""The War"" with a sky ""hole"" opening up to outer space due to the Teseract and some highly valuable metal coming together to make one big, bad, technological machine on top Stark Tower.
The Avengers hold them all off with the Hulk smashing everything in his path that is foreign and alien, even going through buildings to get to them.
The Hulk eventually makes his way to Stark Tower and confronts Loki, to which could be one of the most hilarious scenes in Marvel Universe history. lol Then comes the Government, without the authorization of any US military, The President or the Pentagon for that matter, the ""Panel"" that oversees SHIELD decides to launch a nuclear strike on the island of Manhattan where the hole in space and aliens are above. (My question is this: How come not a single US military fighter jet was seen over the airspace of NYC? lol Surely they were not all told to ""stand down"" during an alien invasion from outer space?) Ahh, but we can't get into military strategy when we have the Avengers on the ground, not to mention a few NYC police and, wait, an Army unit or two showing up late in the fight? lol It's all about the Heroes that must do battle against the evil Loki and his schemes for World domination and they do a ""Marvelous"" job! lol

This edition has the movie in 3D, 2D, DVD, Digital Copy and Music download. (As far as the last two, I wouldn't hold my breath for them to work on everything technology has to offer to this date.)
The menu is fantastic with music from the movie in background and moving characters. Selections are easy.
Commentary by director Joss Whedon
Marvel One Shot: Item 47 (an alien weapon left over is somehow made useable and the two that have it use it for old fashioned bank robbing.)
Gag Reel
Deleted and Extended Scenes
Featurettes
Sound Garden Music Video ""Live To Rise""
A Visual Journey
Assembling the Ultimate Team
(If you got your package by the way of TARGET, you got an additional BLURAY BONUS DISC entitled ""Building A Cinematic Universe"" which is very good.) So, you basically got 3 BLURAYS and one DVD, if you don't count on those other two things that most would find useless in some way.
I love the movies and I love this one as well. It can only get more exciting as we get closer to the showdown of The Avengers all together battling Thanos with the ""Glove"".  As of this writing, up next is Captain America: Civl War due out next year. Principal photography has already started. Yay.

UPDATE: As of mid June 2015, The new actor for Spiderman has been cast and will be introduced in the next Captain America: Civil War!
Buy your Blu-rays of this one at a TARGET. If you have any problems you can exchange with receipt. Anyway, the bonus bluray disc is pretty good.

There's plenty of cartoon action (face it; CGI is just modern cartooning) but no real story, no hero is permanently damaged, so nothing has changed. Without change, becoming less, becoming more, it's just CGI action without any point. We know the franchise heroes aren't going to die, fall in love, marry, have children. There's no way we can become involved in life issues, so there's no drama. But if all you want from a movie is things blowing up and bad guys being killed, along with some comic relief provided by one-liners, then you should really enjoy this.",1431043200,,625,4.6909090909090905

Loki is a great villain in this movie and i'm happy they made movies of each individual superhero and not just make a movie to throw all these heros together. Marvel made a really great movie and i love watching it. I love captain america. He's my favorite hero out of the avengers.

The seller was quick, and the movie was well packed. My gripe is with the packaging. There has been a trend in the past few years to make dvd/bluray packaging plastic as thin as possible. My movie case was cracked in three places on arrival, with no apparent damage to the packaging. Furthermore, only one of the tabs that hold the discs in place was still intact. I'd rather my discs come in a clear vinyl sleeve with this kind of quality... Then again, those clear sleeves tend to be a bit thicker.",1429574400,,663,4.533333333333333

The only thing I don't care for it the way the speech is tough to hear and when mixed with music it becomes nearly impossible to hear the conversation, I had to use headphones to hear the dialog. I tried every setting on the home theater to improve the sound but Dolby audio has been doing something to mess up the voice quality over the past few years, wish they would consider the dialog when they make a movie and leave the audio effects as a secondary item, after all the noises are loud enough without pumping them up.",1428537600,,632,4.364406779661017

3672529,5,B001KVZ6HK,"There's never been a franchise like this before. From 2008 to 2011, Marvel released five superhero films.(Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) All five films had scenes at the end that hinted that a ""team"" was coming together. In 2012, they came together!
This was like the season finale. Everything has been building up to this and this was the payoff. And boy, was this a payoff!
There's never been anything like this before! Never before have four different film series come together in one film! Seeing these characters together, interacting with each other was incredible!(well, Bruce Banner not as much, seeing how he's played by a different actor. Mark Ruffalo rather than Edward Norton. Ruffalo was still great though!)
Some critic said that this film was like Christmas for Marvel fans. It was! There are so many references and characters that you will only get if you've seen the other films!
All that aside, this film is outstanding in it's own right! The cast is great! Robert Downey Jr. once again gives an outstanding performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Sam Jackson is strong as Nick Fury! Tom Hiddleston is great! As is Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson... and really everyone else.
Joss Whedon is an outstanding writer and director!
The action scenes are phenomenal! Each and every one!
The final battle in New York was so epic! Seeing them all fighting together was really something else.
The only criticism I have for this film is that Hawkeye, one of the six Avengers, gets pretty much no Character Development. This might be due to the fact that he is under Loki's mind control for the first 90 minutes of the film, but still.
The best scene of the film will always be the ""rag doll"" scene.(Hulk vs. Loki) There was not a single person in the overcrowded theater i saw this film in that wasn't clapping and laughing at that unforgettable scene! It was the scene that everybody was talking about too.
Long story short: This film is a classic!",1427241600,,2014,4.790229885057471

3672550,5,B001KVZ6HK,"This reboot of the 1998 Avengers was a successful blockbuster hit.  I don't exactly know why they wrote off Mr. Steed, but I guess that is forgivable.  Dr. Peels transformation was subtle by giving her a name change and code name.  I loved the movie because I'm an old hero spy action flick fanboy.  It used to be only fanboys liked movies like this and they did not do so well in the theaters.  So why did it really do so well?  First off, they did not make it corny or campy.  For some reason in the past comics converted into movies were generally corny.  Super corny.  The comics I followed were hardly corny and dealt with metaphors and human nature.  Only young children like corny, and you don't make a movie with fighting and violence for young children.  A good parent will be annoyed and not want to take them.  Keep the corny comic movies on TV where they belong.  Now who goes to movies more?  Young adults and teens.  It's great for a date.  When choosing a movie for a date, you want a movie the girl will enjoy and one that the guy can like too.  Avengers has three things girls really like a lot; Robert Downy Jr., Chris Hemsworth, and Chris Evans.  And for the guys; babes and lots of action.  As an extra added bonus, there is witty dialog and some brainy talk for those of us who enjoy that in a movie as well.  All and all, Avengers pleases the whole family, even the little kids who can enjoy the pretty colors and Hulk smashing Loki.  Oh yeah speaking of which, we don't all consciously notice it, but the pretty colors do effect our psyche and make the movie more appealing.  That's something the Director of Guardians of the Galaxy caught on to.  I hope they can use the same formula for the next Hulk movie.",1426982400,,1732,4.3105590062111805

3672609,5,B001KVZ6HK,"Not too often does the audience get a superhero movie that manages to do everything right. But that is just the case with the Marvel movie The Avengers.

Nick Fury arrives at a facility where Dr. Erik Selvig is doing research on the Tesseract. Upon arrival, the Tesseract begins to spiral out of control, and suddenly the Asgardian foe Loki appears wanting the Tesseract for his own use. As Loki gains control of SHIELD agent Clint ""Hawkeye"", and Dr. Selvig, Loki manages to escape with the Tesseract and Nick Fury realizes that the Avengers Initiative is needed now more than ever.

Robert Downey Jr. once again returns as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and he does a terrific job. Both the intelligent and sarcastic(but funny) side of Tony Stark are what we get to see as an audience; which for this movie in particular adds to the memorable humor this movie has. Captain America is still trying to adjust to life in the present day while still having flashbacks of his past, and Chris Evans does a great job in his role. Chris Hemsworth once again swings his mighty Mjolnir hammer as Thor and does a great job. I especially love the fight scene between Thor and the Hulk. And speaking of Hulk, Mark Ruffalo not only does an exceptional job, but he in fact steals the show as Bruce Banner/Hulk. There are NUMEROUS memorable moments in The Avengers, but each scene that involved the Hulk is absolutely AWESOME! Seriously. While I will say that I was surprised/disappointed that a Hulk solo movie was not included in the Phase 3 lineup, my sincere hope is that Mark Ruffalo(who reportedly has a six picture movie deal with Marvel) gets to portray Hulk in a solo film. Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury and does a good job. Scarlett Johansson returns as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow kicking a lot of butt and looking incredibly attractive while doing it. One thing that I have come to realize is that you can really tell Tom Hiddleston has a lot of fun playing Loki. Loki IS Tom Hiddleston's character and two words to describe Loki would be: Enchantingly Evil. The way he walks, talks, even that devilish grin of his, is all a part of why Loki is portrayed so very well by Tom Hiddleston. Clark Gregg returns as Agent Phil Coulson and does a nice job. Jeremy Renner stars as Hawkeye and even though he's not on screen very often, I enjoyed his performance thoroughly.

The action sequences and visuals are nothing short of incredible. While The Avengers deals with many characters, not one time does the movie lose its focus; nor does it ever lose your interest. The story is funny and action packed, but it also has some serious moments. That too, and the buildup is perfectly timed throughout the course of the movie's screentime. Whether you are a fan of Iron Man's suit, Captain America's shield, Natasha's dashingly good looks, Hulk's infamous Hulk smash, or the famous god of thunder Thor, The Avengers is a wonderful movie due to the acting, the fun-loving/perfectly paced timing of the story, the insanely good action scenes, and the talented direction of Joss Whedon.

So what's next for our heroes? Where do they go from here? Well on May 1, 2015, GET READY to find out.

A Great Experience

This turned out to be surpringly good for me even though I don't get into the graphic novel/comic book subculture all that much...I am one who can still appreciate the work that goes into it. Villainous Asgardian Loki, the god of mischief has been threatening to steal the ""tesseract"" (aka cosmic cube)...a portal that can bend reality to whatever the holder wishes. This weasely-looking character Loki (also Thor's half brother) conspired with the Chitauri , an alien race led by the ""Other"" who apparently promise Loki an alien army with the ability to subjugate all earthlings, in return for the powerful Tesseract . Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and the Hulk team up with Nick Fury ( the director of the S.H.E.I.LD agency), Black Widow and Hawkeye to defeat Loki and his alien arms once and for all.  For a blockbuster movie hit this one was a real winner and this combo pack dvd/blu-ray set with special features turned out to be an excellent purchase overall!

3672706,5,B001KVZ6HK,"At first I thought that this might not live up to the comic book version of Marvel's Avengers that I grew up with as a kid. I was pleasantly surprised and glad to be wrong. This not only lived up to my expectations but exceeded it. Nice touch, a black Nick Fury; Samuel Jackson plays the role well. With so much hype and success with the Iron Man movies, it was nice to see that this was a balanced approach to all the members of the team. The tech was great, the plot was very good, and the action was intense.

The plot revolves around Thor's Asgardian brother Loki, conspiring to gain the tesserract, (remember the cube that the Red Skull had to have in ""Captain America?"") He is staging an invasion of earth and only the Avengers can stop him. (naturally)

Black widow shines in the scene where she is tied to a chair and able to be killed by Russian mobsters. She gets a phone call from  Fury and the mobsters hand her her phone. She explains she is busy, that she has the mobster where she wants them and is about to break him. He tells her to come in anyway. She hangs up, and still tied to a chair, best at least four mobsters.

There was a memorable scene where Captain America is accusing Iron Man of being nothing without his suit. Tony Starks' replies that he is a ladies man, a billionaire, and a genius inventor--all without his suit. There is tension between the Avenger members. In one scene, Hulk punches Thor down, and Thor and Iron Man go at it over the possession of Loki, whom they'd captured.

I loved how both Black Widow and Hawkeye, the only two Avengers with no superpowers, stepped up during the final battle and used their skill sets at superpower levels.

I have to admit that I watch it again and again for this one scene. Thor's brother Loki, is confronted by The Hulk. He says to him that the he is a god, and he will not be manhandled. Hulk grabs him by the leg and smashes him left and right a few times against the concrete floor, and then pronounces, ""Puny God.""

Top rate action, and all of the cast did a superb job of acting, and the development of the characters in the plot was excellent. This is one of Marvel's best translation from comic book to cinema.

The way he rag dolled Loki and proclaimed ""Puny god"" had me on the floor. The subtle humor throughout is just good fun. Just sit back and enjoy something fun for a  change if this isn't your normal type of movie. If you read the comics when you were a kid you'll be glad you did.",1425081600,,570,4.181818181818182

3672726,5,B001KVZ6HK,"What else can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Marvel Studios continues to spin everything they touch into gold amd Joss Whedon does it again (cause he's a genius). It's an excellent movie, and Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Scarlet Johansen, and Jeremy Renner were made to play Steve Rogers/Captain America, Tony Stark/Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston reprises his role as a deliciously villianous Loki, and Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury with just the right edge of shade and brashness. The one actor I don't love in this movie is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk. I preferred Edward Norton as the Hulk, and there's something about Ruffalo's Hulk that doesn't quite sit right with me. I can't quite put my finger on it, but if I did, the Hulk would probably break it.

I cannot wait to see Ultron. James Spader is absolutely the choice to voice the bad guy.",1424649600,,927,4.75776397515528

Amazing f/x and a great musical score make for a can't miss movie. Whether you are a fan of these characters or this genre you shouldn't miss this movie.,1423958400,,307,4.703703703703703
3672777,3,B001KVZ6HK,"Good fun action adventure sci fi epic film, bringing in most of the Marvel characters together on a mission to save planet Earth from a cosmic alien invasion.  Let me state this to be clear, ""Avengers"" is NOT great film making nor is it worthy of being considered as an first rate epic movie.  Never the less it is entertaining with amazing special effects and good fight scenes between the superheroes.

 What was good about the film: Loved seeing Captain America team up with the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Colonel Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), and the Black Widow.  Bringing in all of the previous movies together into one epic masterpiece was well done, with excellent stunts, special effects, costumes, drama, and well kept continuity (unlike X-Men whose continuity is not good).

 Iron Man, the Hulk, and Captain America's characters are the focus of this film, while the villain from ""Thor"" is the primary bad guy.  New York is under attack again, and only the Avengers can stop these aliens from leveling the world.

 It did seem to me that unlike past superhero epics, the heroes are not entirely invincible, the good guys have no problem using their guns along with their hammer, shield, or laser blaster which makes the movie a bit more realistic.

 What I didn't like: It struck me that these alien soldiers were a bit carbon cookie cutter types, that they were really easy to kill and no real match for the heroes.  The plot did not strike me as being too complex or a ""thought provoking"" one, it seemed generic giving it the ability to attract and please most American movie goers who do not want to, nor in most cases have the intellectual capacitance to seek a more thought out plot driven film.  The movie makers from Marvel really wanted to focus on stunts, special effects, and eye candy actors with their imagery more then creating anything else deeper.  Because of this the film comes out very entertaining but ultimately hollow inside with no real message or deeper meaning unlike other past epics like ""Star Wars"" &""Star Trek"". ""Batman"", or ""Terminator"".

 Unfortunately Avengers 2 Age of Ultron I thought was terrible, but the Captain America sequel and this movie are very good.  This movie, if you are a sci fi action fan of comic book characters, is one you will probably like.",1423958400,,2295,4.738035264483627

3672832,3,B001KVZ6HK,"Much much much better than all the Marvel movies before it. But by the time I saw this on my third viewing I began to see past the novelty and the smokescreen of glamour this movie casted on me the first time.

I came to realize that I don't like Scarlet Johansson in the role of a Russian super spy. Just me. And I still don't care for Hemsworth as Thor in his fake blonde dyed hair and phony cape. Reminds me of Jessica Alba with her poorly dyed blonde hair and blue contact lenses to play Richard Reeves golden haired wife Susan (invisible girl) in the horribly made Marvel movie The Fantastic Four.

Never have been a big fan of the comic version of this title. Perhaps that's why I'm not totally a huge fan of this movie. The main plot is nothing inspiring. It lacks originality and is totally void of what makes people care for a character(s). However, the action is decent and the character interactions are humorous at times and the special effects are top notch. But that's all. I guess for some people that's all you really need.

The characters had their own demons, but they did play well together.

Loki had a certain charm, with his evil ways, that kept you from wanting to ""bitch slap him back"" to his home planet.

Great art and craft credits all around don't hurt a bit.  What fun!",1420416000,,319,5.235294117647059

3672982,5,B001KVZ6HK,"I just rented this on Amazon.com and LOVED it! I I cannot decide which I like better between this and Captain America:the Winter Soldier. Both films are OUTSTANDING! Easily the two best superhero movies EVER made! CGI/special effects that will blow...your...mind! I like Thor in this film much better than in his own films. He seems to be his normal, warrior self more in this film than in Thor(his own film). In Thor, he was I think a little ""weak in the knees"" compared to the Thor I grew up with in comics and cartoons. The Hulk was done excellently and with pinpoint accuracy. Iron Man fighting Thor was awesome! They kept this film true to the comics as to just how strong the heroes and villains are. When Captain America fought Loki, Cap was barely holding his own. When Iron Man started fighting Loki, Stark trashed Loki's behind in one shot! Loki can bench about 25 tons. Captain America can bench about 1 ton. Iron Man can bench about 50 tons. The Hulk fighting Thor has been the ""dream match"" for decades in comics and they have fought only a few times but when they have, they usually beat each other senseless! The Hulk at peak can bench about 500 tons. When calm, only about 85 tons.  Thor's strength has never been pushed to the limits but when calm he can bench about 120 tons. Thor at peak is rumored in comics to bench about 450 tons. Who would win in a fight to the death between Hulk and Thor? Unarmed, the Hulk. Armed with his hammer, Thor could actually beat the Hulk easily. I have an animated DVD film where Thor actually nearly killed the Hulk when Hulk invaded Asgard by using the full power of Mjolnir, the mystical hammer he carries which was blessed by Odin. Thor did not kill Hulk but when he showed the Hulk mercy, it was probably a mistake because the Hulk got up and nearly killed Thor! If it wasn't for Lorelei the Enchantress persuading Hela the Death Goddess not to take Thor to Niffleheim, the Norse Land of the Dead, the Hulk would have killed Thor! But enough of other films. The Avengers will satisfy the science fiction fan, the action fan, and the comic book fan to the maximum! With the possible exception of Captain America:the Winter Soldier, this is the best superhero movie EVER!",1420416000,,2226,4.496296296296296

3673247,5,B001KVZ6HK,"The Avengers is a superhero film produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It is based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. It is the sixth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the story,Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D.,recruits Iron Man,Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's adoptive brother Loki from subjugating Earth. When an unexpected enemy emerges that threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury finds himself in need of a team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. Spanning the globe, a daring recruitment effort begins.

Enhanced picture, enhanced sound, enhanced film: The Avengers feels like it's truly in its element on the small screen, and Buena Vista's impressive roster of supplements does the movie proud. Added to that,the performances are so well-pitched in The Avengers, meshing with such vividness and ease, that it's tempting to overpraise the good but not great movie that surrounds them. If you are a Marvel fan, then The Avengers will feel like Christmas. Thanks to the merry doings of the director, Joss Whedon, all your favorite characters are here, as shiny and as tempting as presents under the tree. Obviously,it is one of the best superhero films ever released on screen.",1419292800,,1343,5.132420091324201

Everyone else was, of course, excellent as expected.  The best thing about the movie, however, was the choice of director.

I know I can't be the Only viewer that feels this way.  I don't care if the movie is 2 hrs long if I can enjoy it better.

3673443,5,B001KVZ6HK,"Absolutely the best action movie of all time. And it will be very hard to top.
The cast selection on this movie was just about perfect.

Robet Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Scarlett Johanson as Black Widow, Chris Evans and Captain America
and Tom Hissleston as Loki were just perfect casting hands down. Anyone else trying to play those roles in the future are going to have a real problem filling those parts.

As for Samuel L. Jackson-The Black Nick Fury, Clark Greggs-Agent Phil Coulson, Gwyneth Paltrow-Pepper Potts, Chris Hemsworth-Thor, Mark Ruffalo-Hulk, Cobie Smulders-Maria Hill and Jeremy Renner-Hawkeye, these have made those rolls their own and will be hard to replace in future sequences. It would be a shame to replace them for future movies but that is sure to happen due to some of the actors other commitments. But if possible every effort should be made to get at least 5 more movies out of all the cast before anyone can be lost.

The dialogues of the movie are just great and the way that the characters play off of each other was just wonderfully refreshing. The witty wise cracks like Thor shifting from hes my brother to hes adopted,  Banner  saying,  you can smell crazy on him referring to Loki, the hilarious battle between Thor and the Hulk with Hulk sucker punching Thor,  and what I think is the best piece in movie history, when Loki rants Im a God and the Hulk snatches him and smacks the floor with him leaving him groaning and saying puny God- absolutely the best scene in movie history!! I saw the move three times when it came out and that scene drove the crowd crazy with laughter every time, myself included.

As I said, the Hulk, the only animated hero character of the movie, stole the show. His battle scenes against the aliens were fantastic. The animators clinched the essence of who the Hulk perfectly.

My only concern is that future sequels will be ruined by directors trying to be witty and over creative.
But as for now, this movie is the standard for action adventures. Only time will tell if the creators have the wisdom and ability to maintain this master piece going forward.",1419033600,,2120,4.647058823529412

3673450,3,B001KVZ6HK,"It's not a bad movie, but not great.  Pretty much all of the stars are good looking, even the villain, and they make a lot of noise destroying ""stuff"".  Still, it's at least never boring.  It's just okay.",1418947200,,204,4.315789473684211

8316230,4,B001KVZ6HK,Cool to bring these threads together.  Character-focused.  The plot isn't: can they stop the bad guy.  It's: Can these personalities work together to become more than the sum of their parts.  Meanwhile there's great quipping and decent action.  And is that finally a memorable line of music (if only one)?  And a decent villain.,1527033600,,328,4.981481481481482

8316232,5,B001KVZ6HK,"This movie marked the first time we seen the gang get together on the big screen. And it was so worth the wait.

From a cinematography standpoint this probably doesn't hold up against some of the recent Marvel films. But it is still remains a great film. And worth checking out.",1526688000,,278,4.450980392156863
