8316267,4,B001KVZGEI,"During the opening credits, a radio news report tells of four Christchurch residents reported missing and then cuts to a sleeping woman (Gina) alone in a room who awakens singing instead of talking. In another room, a man (Brian) experiences the same uncontrolable urge to sing. Hearing a distant scream, they leave their rooms, discover each other and come upon two others (Steph and Pete) with the same condition. After about 6 minutes, they stop singing and discover they can talk without singing.

A middle-aged woman(Carol) enters who says she has been in this place for a week and there are others. She introduces them to Hans, Felicity and Doug. Hans has been there the longest - 92 days. They have found that increasing, uncontrolable emotion forces them to sing and dance in harmony. In the course of trying to figure out who has done this to them and how to get out, various relationships develop and are examined.

At one point the Carol character says that ""Musicals don't need to make sense"". I agree - they don't. If they did, we would all be losers. Although there are some aspects of the dialogue that I feel could stand improvement and some further editing would be helpful, I think this is a unique and refreshing effort out of Christchurch that deserves great credit for a entertaining and memorable score and libretto. The soundtrack will probably sell quite well and deserves to do so, but do make a point of seeing the movie, if only to see something truly different this season - but careful, you might find yourself leaving it with an uncontrolable urge to sing.",1226620800,,1586,4.742753623188406
