8500061,5,B006K5H5M0,"There are two things I want to get across in this review.  1) Although this is a German release and all the packaging is in German, there is an option on the disk to play it in English.  When you insert the disk and the menu pops up you'll see an option for Einstellungen (settings), it's the third one down.  Once selected you'll see the option for English, select English and then Fortfahren (continue).  Now you can watch BnB just as you would on CBS here in the states.  2) Just because your DVD player is ""region 1"" doesn't mean you can't use this disk.  If you Google your DVD brand and model there are websites out there that provide codes to override the programming and make your player region free.  When DVDs first came out, regions were created as a way to protect the film industry because different countries would release films months apart.  That's not really an issue anymore.  I have about the cheapest DVD player you can buy so if i was able to do it chances are you will too.  Good luck!",1358294400,7,1007,4.365591397849462

8500063,3,B006K5H5M0,It would be nice if this was released in the US so we can buy for a more affordable price. I would  also like to see more episodes per collection. 25 episodes can be watched in just a few days. They should do a full year's worth.,1346803200,6,229,3.872340425531915
