An incredibly thorough accounting of a less known modern music phenomenon, the film includes countless interviews and testimonies from a broad variety of personalities who were central to the punk music scene in DC during the early 80's. Although I personally was not a part of that scene, nor a particularly avid punk music follower, I found the film to be engaging, educational and entertaining nonetheless. The cinematic quality proved that it doesn't take Hollywood budgets to produce a fine picture.  Anyone who appreciates a good rock documentary will enjoy this film.

7307224,3,B010CG2GLM,"** Review originally posted at https://midnighttosix.wordpress.com/

A documentary on the D.C. punk scene should be an easy win, yet somehow Scott Crawfords film falls short of expectations. He tells the story of how D.C. became a key stop on the map of American punk through old band footage, and interviews with a lot of same talking heads youve seen in a ton of other music documentaries (Thurston Moore, Ian MacKaye, Henry Rollins, Dave Grohletc.), yet despite D.C. housing such a fertile scene, with so many unique facets and characters, Crawfords movie sticks to the basics of whats already known, and ignores opportunities to dig deeper and pull new angles out of old stories. So, while you get the headlines of straightedge, Dischord, Revolution Summer, and the idea/ideal factory that is Ian MacKaye, the film ignores other interesting moments.

Among other things, why not look at:

*The Bad Brains leaving D.C. to move to New York?

*Henry Rollins leaving small local band State Of Alert to join Black Flag in California?

*What was it like for Alec MacKaye to be part of the DC scene, but always under his brothers shadow?

*Stories about the high-school aged Teen Idles travelling across the country to play shows in California?

*The economics of running a label like Dischord?

*What the local D.C. music/punk scene was like prior to Dischord and how those participants reacted to the new kids taking over their scene?

*D.C. punks fights with people from other East Coast punk scenes  specifically New York?

These things could have made the story behind the music a lot more human than it appears. With these elements missing you're left with a very watchable, but dry and mild-mannered documentary thats essentially a film version of a Wikipedia page, where facts take center stage over people and emotions.

In addition to the 103 minute film, theres a bunch of extra interview footage and lo-fi live performances.",1449792000,5,1933,5.00625
7307225,5,B010CG2GLM,"New from MVD is a long-awaited document of the Washington DC punk scene from 1980-1980. I have been a fan of many of the bands in this documentary since I was a teenager so this was one doc I did not want to miss.

Directed by scenester Scott Crawford (there is some great footage of him as a teen outside of a punk show back in the day), Salad Days is a chronicle of one of the most beloved and important time periods in punk rock history. Named after a Minor Threat song, this film features interviews with Minor Threat's Ian Mackaye, the most important figure from the DC hardcore scene and possibly of independent music itself, with his philosophies on affordable, youth oriented music through his Dischord record label and all ages shows. Also included are interviews with Henry Rollins, SNL's Fred Armisen and members of such integral DC bands as Fugazi, Government Issue, Minor Threat, Dag Nasty and many more.

Salad Days is a very welcome documentary for the punk community. Both informative and entertaining, with an amazing soundtrack (including a score from DC staple Michael Hampton from The Faith/Embrace/S.O.A.), this film excels on all levels. Well written, visually exciting are the words I would use to describe this great documentary. And the music! What great, great music.",1449532800,,1293,4.872727272727273
7307226,5,B010CG2GLM,Purchased as a gift.  Very happy.  You're missing out if you're a fan and don't buy this.,1448755200,,89,4.176470588235294
7307227,5,B010CG2GLM,"There are certain areas that are associated with particular genres and times in the history of music.  When you think of Seattle the first thing that comes to mind is either Starbucks or grunge.  The thriving music scene in Athens, GA gave us the B-52s and REM, among others, in the early 80s.  Among many cultural centers that are important to the development of punk rock, Washington, DC was the birthplace of a scene that created many of the trends and sound that have influenced punk and alternative music for the past 3 decades.  Director Scott Crawford set out to document those fertile years between 1980 and 1990 that saw a punk rock go from a handful of misfits, to a burgeoning scene, to a political force in the span of about a decade.

If you have any familiarity with punk during the 1980s you will find it as no surprise that much of this documentary focuses on Dischord Records, and the scene that grew around the label.  Originally formed as a way for Ian MacKaye to put out records by his bands (Teen Idles, Minor Threat, Embrace, Fugazi, Evens), Dischord soon became MacKayes vehicle for chronicling the growing scene around the Washington, DC area.  In the early 1980s the label released records by not only Ians bands, but SOA (featuring a young Henry Rollins on vocals), Void, Faith, and Government Issue, and in doing so turned a handful of hardcore bands into a movement with widespread influence beyond the isolation of their community.  Dischord remains a bastion of DIY integrity and great music to this day.

While hardcore and Dischord are the most familiar elements of the DC scene, There were bands outside of this realm that had a major impact on music . Certainly, the punk and reggae sound of Bad Brains has left an enduring influence on heavy music.  Bands like Soulside and Shudder To Think were years ahead of the mainstream alt rock that shook the late nineties.  While many think of straight edge as the primary social movement within this period (despite its divisive impact on the scene), Positive Force became a political and social revolution in the DC scene, leading punks to become both politically aware and socially active.  Even the go-go scene gets a nod in this documentary, which focuses on many elements of the creative burst of energy that occurred in the nations capital during this time.

I have never seen a documentary that covers this musical era as well as Salad Days does.  Interviews with a number of musicians and concert promoters give the viewer a very personal look into that period of time.  MacKaye, Rollins, J. Robbins (Government Issue, Jawbox, Burning Airlines), Dave Grohl (Scream, Nirvana, Foo Fighters) and Brian Baker (Minor Threat, Bad Religion) are but a few of the notable names that offer their insight into both the good and bad that came with the growth, development, and shifts of this iconic time in the musical landscape.  Grohl, a member of DC band Scream before joining Nirvana, offers some interesting insight on both the influence of 1980s DC punk, and the insular nature of the scene.  In the end, Ian MacKaye sums it up best, stating that Washington DC is a Petri dish of great ideas.  Those ideas have spilled over to infect hard rock, punk, alternative and heavy metal in a way that will be felt for generations to come.  Salad Days is an engrossing look at the inside of scene most of us only know by clichs and assumptions, and is, in many ways, the oral history of a movement.",1446768000,,3469,4.7135761589403975

7307257,5,B010CG2GLM,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

In the late seventies the music scene was stirred from complacency by a form of music that came to be known as punk. Fast and furious, three chord structure and unharmonious vocals were the rage providing anyone with the opportunity to become a rock star. Well except that the whole idea of punk music was to turn the establishment on its head so to be a star was sort of defeating the purpose. The whole idea of punk rock music was to strip music down to the essentials, getting rid of the overproduced music that had filled the airwaves and making it accessible to the masses. The lyrics were more political than even those of the protest fueled sixties. It was something new based in something old, the garage rock bands of the early days of rock. While remnants of the punk rock scene remain for the most part it came and went rather quickly, mostly gone within a decade.

One thing about the punk scene though was that it was as regional as the tried and true rock scene that came before. England had the jump on most with its working class heroes decked out in safety pins and dyed Mohawks. New York had the Ramones in the forefront and CBGBs featuring artists like Richard Hell and Talking Heads. California produced bands such as The Germs, X and the Dickies. But while those bands all seemed to attract the most attention there was a dedicated punk following beginning in of all places Washington, D.C. that spawned some of the bigger names outside of both coasts. Thats what this film is about.

Premiere among the bands from the D.C. area was Minor Threat. One of the main members of that band, Ian MacKaye takes center stage early on in this film having not only because of his involvement with that band but also because along with fellow band member Jeff Nelson he founded Dischord Records, the main record company to issue most of the music coming from bands in the D.C. scene.

The documentary focuses on the scene from its early inception through to the years when it seemed to falter and nearly disappear. What makes it more interesting than anything, at least in my opinion, was watching the discussions and timeline of the scene as it went from a rough and ready music that appealed to a niche market (which the bands were happy with) into a music that the masses of suburban kids adopted making it a bigger item. When that happened those who were there from the start began to lose interest or to become the stars that they never wanted to be. With something that was supposed to be so subversive it ended up following the same path that mainstream rock and roll had followed, changing from rawer sound to a more technically produced one, from basement production companies to major labels. This makes for a fascinating film that features numerous interviews and captures tons of live performances by both early and later bands.

Having been around during the time when punk was beginning I was never a fan. It wasn't until later that I began enjoying some of but not all the bands. That being the case this movie was more interesting for me then it might be for someone who is well versed in the history of the scene and its many players. As a novice to that music I found it interesting to watch the development of the music as it changed from the do it yourself style at first that eventually reshaped to the grunge movement later on. Id never made the connection before. I also never realized that there were different styles of punk rock music, some of which Id not heard before. Not only was there the straight punk scene it was divided into two forms, the straight edge scene (so called because they were made up of bands and fans that were mostly underage and didn't drink or do drugs) and the hardcore scene that did do these things.

Like the music or not to learn about the whole culture of the punk rock scene from D.C. makes for an interesting movie that holds your interest from start to finish. And while you watch and listen you might actually discover that some of the music being played is actually much better than you remember it being. For those of us raised on KISS and Journey to hear the bands like Minor Threat and The Ramones was a turn off early on. Looking back and listening to it now I find that I tend to appreciate it much more now than I did at the time. It also means that Ive discovered some bands I need to check out that I missed back then like Fugazi.

In the end this is a documentary that does what the genre of film making is supposed to do. It presents a head on look at the topic at hand, an even handed look that presents warts and all. Sure the director of this film was a fan and actually was a part of the scene at the time, but while his love of the topic at hand is apparent it doesnt cloud his judgement when making the film. He tells it like it is using a combination of interviews and archived footage to make the movie interesting, informative and above all else entertaining. It might not be your cup of tea but I highly recommend watching this one, a must for music fans and for everyone else as well.",1443484800,5,5133,4.419661733615222

7307259,5,B010CG2GLM,"I was lucky to see this in theaters twice, at AFI in Silver Springs, Md., and at a special screening at NPR. To see a doc twice and enjoy it equally (if not more) the second time than the the first time means it's worthy of 1.) purchasing on Amazon and 2.) encouraging others to do the same...

First off, this doc was the talk of town this past year -- and for good reason. Because DC is the last place you think of when you think of punk (or at least it was for me), but it turns out Washingtonians led the movement. This doc tells the unlikely and largely untold story of the punk scene in Washington. The photos and interviews are top notch and, at times, transported me to DC in the 80s. It also helped me redefine a town I once thought to be too stiff and uncool.

Even if you are not a hard core punk music aficionado you will enjoy the documentary Salad Days. As a film and history buff, and not so much a punk music buff, I found Salad Days to be fascinating  for the visuals alone as well as the amazing story. (Especially liked the filming in black and white of the past performances as well as current interviews with more mainstream musicians like Dave Grohl). Also interesting to learn that this movement started in the Georgetown area, which music forms influenced the punk scene, and how the punk artists and their audiences reacted to the emerging sound.",1442966400,3,1371,4.326848249027237
7307260,5,B010CG2GLM,"An excellent overview of a very specific and fertile time in the DC music scene. Much like Legs McNeil's classic punk book, Please Kill Me, Scott Crawford allows different, and often contradictory, points of view to be expressed, adding depth and humor to otherwise tired hardcore cliches like Straight Edge and Emo. Though probably even just worth watching for Brian Baker's dry wit and hearing the Minor Threat break-up story, this doc captures a great slice of inspired and inspiring rock'n'roll youth culture.",1442880000,3,513,5.192771084337349

7307262,5,B010CG2GLM,"Scott Crawford manages to condense what was perhaps the most fertile period of 'D.C. hardcore' down to a brisk 100+ minutes. Fans of harDCore are rewarded with loads of great interview subjects -- Brian 'later, nerds' Baker, John Stabb, Skeeter Thompson, Mike Dolfi, Ian MacKaye, and on and on -- and a narrative that effortlessly covers a lot of subject matter economically and enjoyably.  Growing up in the D.C. area, this filled in the gaps in my understanding of the era and the players involved.  Plus there are loads of never-before-seen clips of bands I didn't think there was footage of -- Void (!), Rites of Spring, Beefeater, etc.
