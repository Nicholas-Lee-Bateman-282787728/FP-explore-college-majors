I'v been searching for it since 1968 and am terribly elated that someone had it for sale. I'm thankful that the seller was willing to lower his price and that I could meet that price. Now, my granddaughter can enjoy seeing how The Night Before Christmas was actually written as her mother had an opportunity to do. If everything they sell is as good, I'm sure I'll be purchasing from them again.",1393286400,3,487,4.362637362637362
