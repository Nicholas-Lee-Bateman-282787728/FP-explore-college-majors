8406336,5,B003V1N4F8,Great soccer game! Pele was a huge soccer player! The final game in Mexico was a really exiting game with the right champion(a)!,1390521600,,128,4.608695652173913
8406337,5,B003V1N4F8,"The moment I popped this DVD in I felt I had been transported back
to 1970 in Mexico to watch the favorite team Brazil play a near
flawless title match.  I can't believe I was able to watch the game
in its entirety!  A game I have wanted to see my whole life and have
only seen highlights.  I actually had to order this twice.  The first
seller I ordered from sent me some crappy disc in a paper sleeve with
black marker handwriting on the disc that said ""This side up"". Are you
kidding me!!????  I messaged another seller who had it as new in
shrinkwrap and she said it was the version with the purple/pink case
and cover art but she would not open it up to say if it had a ugly
disc in it.  Boy was I relieved when I got it in the mail.  It was a
much better professional DVD all the way around.  And the quality was
very good!  The handwritten disc one I got the first time around was
extremely pixelated and the audio cut out numerous times.  I don't think
that seller is still on Amazon!  So MAKE sure you get one that comes with
the purple/pink DVD case w/artwork... I would only buy it new as well.
I am hoping they release more World Cup final matches in the future as
I want to relive all the finals!!!",1366070400,,1211,4.046218487394958
8406338,1,B003V1N4F8,"This item turned out to be a copy of the original and it did not come in the cover seen, it came in a plain dvd envelope. Do not purchase unless you really want to see the game, you can probably see it on Youtube.com. I just wanted to surprise my hubby with it.",1317945600,2,261,3.8518518518518516
8406339,4,B003V1N4F8,"I found it very hard to find close to a decent print of the 1970 final. I got one from the U.S.A from a private seller. It is a downloaded copy which was a total surprise when I got it for I felt I got ripped off. Within a little mail pack,a dvd appeared in a white sleeve, no plastic case or color cover, very basic. It starts in fast forward as an intro, then to normal. An English voice is doing the commentating, it may be John Motson. Its not a perfect print, but it is good enough,and it obviously was lifted from tv coverage. Good enough to get for the whole game, if no other choice.",1305158400,,591,4.016949152542373
8406340,5,B003V1N4F8,"IMPORTANT:  Make sure you get the DVD that comes with a case, artwork, and Authenticity Check, it is awesome!
  The quality of the game is quite good considering it is nearly 40 years old.  I made the mistake of buying
  from some guy up here who was just selling the disc and it was horrible.  It didn't have the MA case or
  anything!!??  Let's hope for a Brazil Italia rematch soon in the World Cup final.  And please FIFA do away
  with the stupid penalty kicks... for the games sake!!!  You are single handily ruining the great game of futbol!!!!",1299888000,,551,4.38
8406341,3,B003V1N4F8,"I don't know if it's the individual seller's fault or Amazon's, but I did not receive a nice DVD in a DVD case with all the cover art, as pictured above.  All I got was a DVD-R in a jewel case that someone burned on their home computer and wrote ""Italy v Brazil"" on it with a sharpie.  That being said, the DVD works fine and I'm watching the game as I write this (quality is as good as one could hope for for 1970 television standards).",1288742400,,437,4.011494252873563
8406342,5,B003V1N4F8,"This DVD contains the final game of the 1970 World Cup in its entirety!  I wasn't expecting all 90 mins, but it is all there from the opening kickoff til the final whistle.  The quality is really good considering it is 40 years old!  I believe it is the original English broadcast possibly from one of the US networks.  The graphics and replays are funny because they are so old. But there are even more funny things like the fact that they only have one ball so a few times it gets kicked into the stands and the players have to wait for the audience to throw it back down.
  But now to the game.... it is awesome.  Amazing passing, superb rushes and defenses and a few spectacular saves.  Pele is well... Pele... unbelievable even in his final cup appearance.  His teammates power around him and fend off an early Italy equalizer.  This is in my top 3 World Cup games of all time (and I'm a US fan).  The DVD has a few extras two.... it is from overseas but played fine in my Playstation 3.  I wish it came with some of the semi final games... that would be great because the semifinals that year were ranked even higher in some people's minds!",1278547200,,1146,4.27906976744186
