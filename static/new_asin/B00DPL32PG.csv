5842885,5,B00DPL32PG,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loved it! It arrived promptly and in new condition! Super!,1399248000,,101,4.1
5842886,1,B00DPL32PG,"The chapter dividers are by whole episode only so you can't even easily skip the openings. The discs stack halfway over each other, in the case, so to get to disc 2 you first need to remove disk one. But more seriously the color and image quality are poor. The image is intermittently over saturated, dark, and/or partially doubled.",1397779200,2,332,4.6440677966101696
5842887,5,B00DPL32PG,"I have watched every episode of this series every time it comes on, and love it every time. Some characters are lovable, some are jerks or worse, but what is also surprising is the ""big-name"" voices they got for characters like General Iroh and Zhao.  It's hard not to love the long, enjoyable yarn, and the artwork is world-class.  Kudos to everyone involved in the making of this imaginative and beautiful series!",1392940800,7,415,4.75
5842888,5,B00DPL32PG,"I love this complete collection!!! The ""movie"" butchers this so bad. So skip the ""movie"" and got straight for the source!!! You will not be disappointed!",1392595200,12,153,4.923076923076923
5842889,5,B00DPL32PG,"YEAH WHO NEEDED A LIFE? I DIDN'T, SO I BOUGHT MY FAV SHOW AND I WILL NEVER STOP WATCHING IT.",1391040000,15,92,3.65
5842890,1,B00DPL32PG,"This is a wonderful series. However, there is nothing more disappointing then getting hooked on a series and then realize that you have to stop watching because of a missing disc or mislabeled discs which throw a wrench into your viewing pleasure.  For example, on Season 1 Book 3 the set includes 4 discs. The 1st disc is episodes 1-3, the 2nd disc episodes 4-7. When I put the 3rd disc in it contained episodes 12-15.  I really want to know where episodes 8-11 are?  I have yet to check the rest of the set. I find this really interesting and spent a sick day watching it. I was anxious to purchase book 4 to complete season 1. I'm surprised it was not offered that way as the series shows book 1 as complete.  I would be more than happy to change my rating if the situation was resolved.",1390176000,,790,4.281879194630872
5842891,3,B00DPL32PG,"Disc one of Book Two was scratched very badly. It affected two episodes, making them very difficult to watch. Besides that, the image and sound quality per disc were excellent.",1390176000,,176,4.9
5842892,5,B00DPL32PG,"I absolutely love Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I was very happy with this purchase. I only wish that it came in some kind of box set to hold all three because it is the complete collection.",1388620800,3,192,4.216216216216216
5842893,5,B00DPL32PG,"Can't say enough about this great series. Would recommend to just about anyone. Giving this as a gift.
My whole family loves them.",1387065600,,130,4.695652173913044
5842934,1,B00DPL32PG,This is a great show but why would you buy this when the three books separately cost a total of 33 dollars. This collection is almost 4 times more expensive for no reason at all.,1435795200,6,178,4.114285714285714
5842935,5,B00DPL32PG,Don't buy this way over priced the single seasons are 14 dollars apiece.,1434326400,,72,4.615384615384615
5842936,3,B00DPL32PG,"I give three stars because this show is awesome, I would have given 5 expect I had two MAJOR issues with this. 1) There was nothing unique about this, just all three books wrapped together. They charge double for this, absolutely ridiculous! You should by these separate and save a ton of money. 2) They say its the complete series, but it isn't. Its missing episodes. I just finished this, and during some episodes they showed flashbacks which I did not see after just seeing the whole series. So if you are a diehard fan of this series like I am, just do the smart thing and buy the books separately.",1433894400,11,602,4.4324324324324325
5842937,5,B00DPL32PG,"Absolutely one of the best, well-made tv shows ever. Great art, music, characters, story, everything. Good for all ages, as in the goofy fun is great for kids, coming of age character development great for teens, and excellent craftsmanship (seriously, research all the work put into this series, it is crazy) is great for adults.

Only complaint is on the last disk of book 3 (I got this to re-watch the series, so I went through every disk and every episode) there was a smudge that messed up the video right as I was finishing watching the climax. But after wiping off the smudge, it worked perfectly.",1426377600,,604,4.644859813084112
5842938,5,B00DPL32PG,Good stuff!,1420588800,,11,5.0
5842939,3,B00DPL32PG,"I absolutely love this anime. Special features were a nice touch. My only complaint is that one of the discs was scratched when I received it. I wish I could just get a replacement disc, but you have to send the entire set back and receive a refund, and then buy it again.",1417996800,,272,4.150943396226415
5842940,5,B00DPL32PG,You can but each seperately for a total of about $45. So why does this cost $119? Makes no sence.,1412640000,,97,3.9
5842941,5,B00DPL32PG,"In my opinion this is, hands down, the best cartoon series America has produced yet. It is also the only cartoon series I've found that entertains my nephew while imparting some really legitimate lessons about ethics, family, friendship, community, and persevering through obstacles with hard work and a good attitude. I have never been an adult cartoon nerd, per se, but this series is fantastic. If you enjoy the animated series, I encourage you to NOT watch M. Night Shyamalan's deeply Godawful live-action interpretation. While the cartoon is amazing, I think I would rather watch a 2 hour movie of corpses rotting, expectant mothers having miscarriages, and bugs crawling out of my own navel than see the live-action film again.

TL;DR: This cartoon is amazing and you should watch it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THE LIVE ACTION FILM AS IT IS TRULY AWFUL",1410912000,5,858,4.917241379310345

5842974,5,B00DPL32PG,"We have really enjoyed this set of DVD's, my granddaughters, 13, 16, and 23.  We all sat thru all the dvds and enjoyed the bonding. We have seen various ones on TV but with commercials.  It was pleasant not having the interrupions and we could always pause.t",1408665600,,258,4.468085106382978
5842975,5,B00DPL32PG,I loveeeeeeeeeee this show! It's my favorite cartoon. The movie did not do this show justice. I watch it every chance I get. I promise you will not be disappointed. Buy the complete set!,1407542400,,186,4.5

5842980,3,B00DPL32PG,"I love this series, fantastic. When I got the disc pack it was obviously new and well put together. The only problem I had was that disc one  book one was scratched up quite a bit can't even watch the first episode because of it. I'll have to take it to a nearby disc repair place.",1402012800,,281,4.017857142857143
5842981,4,B00DPL32PG,"Same as what the title says. Everything shipped arrived fine, and for the most part it played well.  For some reason, (a new dvd too) one episode kept skipping like it was terribly scratched.",1400544000,,191,4.617647058823529
5842982,5,B00DPL32PG,"One of the few shows out there that don't talk down to children, that lay out big ideas and complicated relationships, and are still funny and engaging and make the adults tell the kids 'wait till I get there!  Don't turn it on yet!'",1400457600,4,233,4.295454545454546
5842983,5,B00DPL32PG,We love Avatar. It's a show we can watch as a family. Now that it's no longer on the streaming Neflix we found ourselves missing it. So we are glad to finally own it.,1399852800,,166,3.911764705882353

8596056,5,B00DPL32PG,"Fantastic, well written, children's series. Funny, realistic, playful and cute. We watched this as a family when my daughter was in middle school and in high school she asked me to purchase it for her. She wanted her kids to see it when she had them and she wanted to re-watch it again! Definitely worth the money!",1505692800,,314,4.526315789473684
8596057,1,B00DPL32PG,We cannot play the DVDs on any of our DVD players I will be trying to send it back I believe,1487030400,,92,3.4285714285714284
8596058,5,B00DPL32PG,Love the series so far!,1485734400,,23,3.8
8596059,1,B00DPL32PG,"The show itself is absolutely addicting. And not just for children in my opinion. My rating reflects the price. I bought all three at FYE (brand new) for 13 dollars a piece, it's awful that someone would up charge by so much. I just don't want to see so many people get scammed. It pays to check reviews.
One note on the discs: there are no subtitle options, and the boxes fall apart easily but aside from that I loved them. Just definitely not worth over 100 dollars.",1456704000,,468,4.329545454545454
8596060,5,B00DPL32PG,An excellent Japanese American crossover production with real substance to its storylines and depth to its characters.,1455062400,,118,6.0
8596061,5,B00DPL32PG,Great show. Special features are a little lacking. It may seem like episodes are missing but they just aren't on the first page of chapter selections.,1450742400,,150,4.8076923076923075

8596064,5,B00DPL32PG,Awesome. That's all I gotta say about that.,1436572800,,43,4.5
