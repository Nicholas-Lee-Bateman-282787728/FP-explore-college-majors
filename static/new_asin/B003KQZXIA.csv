8638144,2,B003KQZXIA,"The English subtitles are absolutely horrible. It's as if they translated it into Chinese first, then translated from Chinese to English. None of the sentence structure makes sense, and the characters names are translated into Chinese. At some points I wouldn't have even understood what was going on if I hadn't seen the show before. I am really disappointed, since this is a beautiful drama series, I've seen it in its entirety before and I truly love it; and I spent nearly $50 to own it, but the subtitling is so bad it's unwatchable. I didn't even make it through the first episode.",1375228800,,587,4.70873786407767
