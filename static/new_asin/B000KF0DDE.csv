2689001,5,B000KF0DDE,"....this would be it! I was fortunate to be able to see this documentary on a big screen at its release last year. I thought to myself, at the time, that nothing could top that, but that it was a film I would also like to own. The smaller screen wouldn't probably offer the same impact, but it was still a film to add to my library. So, when Amazon offered it, I pre-ordered it and waited. I was wrong. The intimacy of the smaller screen just re-newed my feelings of warmth, awe, shock at the struggles of chicanos in our very own American southwest in the early 40's and fifties, nay, TODAY! Mr. Galan's subtle message that discrimination is still very prevalent in our society today is woven beautifully into this personal family's struggle of rising above that very same treatment and making an unforgettable mark on today's music scene. You get the message, but you get it along with some of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring musical performances you will ever witness! These boys have real talent, and more importantly----something you don't see today----real family values and a deep respect for their heritage and their country, in spite of its treatment to them. Even if you're not a fan of Los Lonely Boys now, you'll enjoy this film---and after you've watched it, you WILL be.",1171497600,5,1289,4.682819383259912
2689002,5,B000KF0DDE,"This is one of the best documentary films I've seen in a long time. Los Lonely Boys overcame poverty and discrimination as children while learning music to rise to the very top of the music industry with their beautiful Grammy winning song ""Heaven"".

The film is an inspriation for young Hispanics and will certainly encourage many musicians to ""Never give up on your dreams"".",1171411200,6,376,4.875
2689003,5,B000KF0DDE,This is definitely the best rocumentary ever made.  Most rock & roll documentaries focus on the concerts and self-agrandizing interviews with the stars.  This movie digs deeper into the roots of Los Lonely Boys and their family.  The story is unforgettable and inspiring.  The sheer talent of the band shines through.  A must-have for anyone who loves rock and roll & blues.,1170806400,5,374,4.967741935483871
2689004,5,B000KF0DDE,"I finally was able to see this film in December after a long wait to see it. The Galans did a wonderful job and captured not only the music but the heart of the Garza family.

It was worth wating for, and I will be adding it to my collection.",1168387200,11,242,3.84
2689005,5,B000KF0DDE,"I saw Cottonfields and Crossroads at the South by Southwest film festival.  I've been waiting to add it to my DVD collection since then.  It captures the struggle that all musicians face as they chase down their dreams, and it delivers with magical moments as those dreams come true.",1168300800,6,283,4.755102040816326
2689006,5,B000KF0DDE,"I have had the honor and priveledge of viewing this Los Lonely Boys documentary several times.  Not only is this a story of 3 brothers rise from playing for 'crowds' in small pubs to having national success with their debut self-titled album. It goes in depth into the history of their hometown, growing up poor, and around discrimination.  It is a roller coaster of emotions, from laughing to being on the verge of tears. I am happy to say that I can watch this movie over and over.",1166745600,10,483,4.4772727272727275
2689007,5,B000KF0DDE,"I discovered the music of Henry, Jojo, and Ringo Garza one day while browsing CDs at a music store.  I listened to a sample of the first track, and I did something to me.  The second track was as equally great.  By the third sample, I had chills.  The SRV/Hendrix/Santana guitar sound was pouring out with a unique passion.  The harmonies reminded me of The Beatles, America, and Eagles.  I purchased the CD and started to search for information about Los Lonely Boys.  I related personally to these brothers from San Angelo on many levels.

Before all of this happened, though, there was a story to be told.  A story about three brothers and their family and their music.  Hector Galan, director of Cottonfields and Crossroads, saw them perform when they were playing in a small Austin bar and felt compelled to capture their electifying stage presense and raw ... yet polished sound.  All of this was before Grammys, magazine covers, and television appearances.

Don't make the mistake of concluding that Cottonfields and Crossroads was created as a promotional piece.  Galan was at the right place at the right time...  and uncovered a familiar story of living in West Texas and growing up as a Mexican-American with all of the richness and strugle that accompanies our raza.

Seeing this film made me even more proud of La Familia Garza and now... La Familia Galan.",1166572800,13,1369,4.7905982905982905

2689011,3,B000KF0DDE,"Just came in the mail last night. Couldn't wait to play it. It's NOT a concert. It's a Documentary.  I was very disappointed. Nobody's fault but mine.

I'll keep it for later when I feel like watching a Documentary, but right now I am going to go find a concert DVD of them.",1346284800,,324,4.209677419354839
2689012,5,B000KF0DDE,"I had the opportunity to meet Henry Garza when the LLB played in Spokane WA August of 2005. He was very personable and down-to-earth. I liked the video because it showed the where he came from and it shows people that you can be successful through hard work and persistence. Writing the song ""Heaven"" finally put LLB where they belong.  At the top!",1194825600,2,348,4.523809523809524

2689015,5,B000KF0DDE,"Great down to earth story of three young musicians and the influence from their Father supporting and encouraging the three brothers love and interest in music.

A very strong family bond, setting the foundation of love and respect for each other and their music.

The behind the scenes views on these three brothers is depedicated on this DVD is done very well.

Los Lonely Boys never forget their roots and where they came from and where it all started for them.

I would have liked to have seen more music performance as well as candid non-formal performance, but what is filmed on this DVD, is well represented of the brohters none the less. A must have if you're a Los Lonely Boys fan of their music.",1173312000,4,705,4.571428571428571
2689016,5,B000KF0DDE,"Well now, baby, I'm from Texas
And I just wanna let you know
'Bout the ways of life and livin' baby
On them Cottonfields and Crossroads

That's the first verse of Los Lonely Boys' song ""Cottonfields and Crossroads"".  It is a blues song that talks about rural West Texas and the part of town that we don't always get to see.

In turn, that song title is applied to Hector Galan's documentary of the early part of Los Lonely Boys ascent from (very) young men backing their dad, to taking creative control themselves, to becoming an Austin, then national favorite.

And you know what?  Mr. Galan takes us to that same part of town in those same rural West Texas towns to show the influences on los hermanos Garza.

Not in a sad or exploitational way, but as a means of setting the scene for the explosive arrival of Los Lonely Boys and Texican Rock and Roll.

For those of you not into long reviews, here's the summary.  GO BUY THIS DVD.

What should you as the buyer know in advance?  (Yes, I'm convinced you'll buy!)

This is a documentary, not a rock concert flick (although a couple of songs have been added for the DVD release).  While several songs are included as backing to the flow of the movie, this is about the boys, their father and mother and families, and a few others who have an insight to offer along the way.

There's been some criticism leveled that the interviews are so tight that they constitute more of an advertisement than an explanation or expansion.  Come on.  There's not 10 years worth of celebrities and critics to line up and interview - but there are people who know the heart and soul of LLB available to talk to the camera.  Advertisement?  Lengthy press release? I don't see it that way, and no one else that I have spoken to about the film has seen it that way; in all fairness, I am an avid LLB fan.

As stated above, the documentary sets the stage for LLB's burst onto the music scene by going back in time in San Angelo to show what it was (and is) like in some ways and coming forward (both at beginning and end) to LLB playing for the home town crowd.

The movie's timeline stops before the band's meteoric rise to take the Grammy for ""Heaven"" - but all of the joy is present, as is the personal charm of the boys.  Henry describing the definition of success will surely touch you.

And there's a fair amount of pain as well as the family splits so that Dad's dream can be followed.  One thing we don't get to see is the effect of all those miles and all those shows on the boy's individual families, which is a shame only in that the wives and children have also helped pay for LLB's success.

So, reader and potential purchaser, let me again offer that this DVD deserves a place in your collection.

If you are a fan anyway - as are the more than 14,000 members of the LLB Street Team - maybe you've already got a copy, and if not, go get it!

If you only have radio exposure to LLB by way of ""Heaven"", I recommend you pick up a copy of the DVD and see the backstory up close and very personal.

I can think of any number of places where this film would also be very, very valuable in the classroom - whether music or history class.

Where to find the DVD?  Here at Amazon and a couple of other outlets.  Order Texican Style, the music DVD of a huge show here in Austin while you are at it.

Where to find LLB on the road?  Go see the schedule at [...], and take my strongest recommendation to see a live LLB show.

And as for LLB themselves?

Still funny, thoughtful, down to earth guys, earning a living to support their families doing something that they truly love to do.

Still very much the home town San Angelo boys...but you knew that, cuz they told us so...

Yes some day I'm gonna go back, baby
And I'm gonna live on my own
But you can only find us baby
On them cottonfields and crossroads

God bless...",1171843200,14,3854,4.260330578512397
2689017,5,B000KF0DDE,"On the West Texas cap rock, where winter winds howl and summer winds blister, an amazing metamorphosis took place.  From hard pan clay and the hard scrabble life of three brothers, Henry, Jojo and Ringo Garza, emerged the fresh, vibrant sound known as Texican rock-n-roll.  Director Hector Galan captures this evolution in his heartwarming documentary, ""Cottonfields and Crossroads"".

La familia es todo becomes the underlying pulse of the film.  Father-and-son conflicts, father-and-son dreams fill the screen with the gamut of human emotion.  Picking cotton or picking guitar were Enrique Garza's sons' choices in the poor, rural area.  Watching Galan's excellent depiction of the family's trials and triumphs puts you IN the Garza shoes and lets you walk a mile.

It's not just music; it's not just trying to stay alive.  It's not just faith.  It's an electricity that flows through Henry's eloquent guitar riffs, Jojo's amazing bass and Ringo's powerful drums.  It's a unity that crowns tight harmony.  It's brotherhood and it's family.  And the Garzas' hearts, as well as their story, are large enough to welcome us all.

Orale!

8156210,5,B000KF0DDE,"This DVD gives you a good look at their upbringing in the Southwest, and a thorough understanding how significant music is to the Garza Bros.  You also see how important family is to them, and their entire family as well, including their parents and sisters.  They are hands down, three of the best musicians that not only San Angelo, Texas has to offer, but one of the very best trios in the world.  I saw them live, and I can vouch for them! They are trecherous, but yet very humble!  I hope they continue to make their style of music for many years to come, and more importantly, keep family first and stay together!  Their DVD, ""Live in Austin"" is awesome too!",1375488000,,664,4.409836065573771
