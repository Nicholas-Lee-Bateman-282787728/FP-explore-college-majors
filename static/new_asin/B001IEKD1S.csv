8310851,5,B001IEKD1S,"Ian Carmichael (Lord Peter Wimsey) was well-known early in his career for playing the ""twit"" - a stumbling character who really has no idea what is really happening around him.  Mr. Carmichael's twits always seemed somehow to prevail as a result of their inherently good nature.  ""Brothers in Law"" is a prime example of his skill at pulling off these roles.  As a young barrister who is just beginning his career in the English court system, he is a little fish swimming in circles in a big pond (make that an ocean).

An entertaining comedy, this film is also an interesting look into the complex workings of the British legal system.  Confusing even to the British, the system is as different as night from day to the U.S. system.  The film is based upon a popular novel written by a prominent judge, and one assumes a certain amount of accuracy.

Richard Attenborough plays Carmichael's more worldly roomate, and a very young Terry-Thomas has a small role as Carmichael's first client.  The highlight of the supporting cast, however, is Miles Malleson as a manic senior barrister who takes on Carmichael's beginner as his tutor.  ""Dad's Army"" fans will recognize John Le Messurier as Carmichael's nemesis - a judge who takes an instant dislike to the young barrister.

A fine example of the brilliant British comedies of the 1950's, this film brings to mind the endearing Ealing comedies of the day.",1345593600,2,1402,4.828451882845188
