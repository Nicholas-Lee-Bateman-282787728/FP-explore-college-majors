7824121,1,6302235944,"I hate to say this as I am and have always been a fan of Robert Wagner's but this film (remake of the original Indiscreet) is very off the mark and makes it very clear, Robert Wagner is no Cary Grant  Cary Grant owned this role even though the plot line is a bit of froth, you believe it in the Grant Bergman version.  If you have seen the original Indiscreet with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman you would understand what I am about to write.  The 1988 remake of Indiscreet with Robert Wagner is a horrible remake of a wonderful romantic movie.  In the original the repartee was wonderful, believable  Cary Grant played his role to the T as did Ms. Bergman.  You got the sense of an older couple who after being jaded and alone in the world meet and fall in love and have a highly sophisticated intelligent romance. One of the best scenes in the original Indiscreet was when Ingrid turns around unsuspectingly with cold cream on her face and faces the exquisite Cary Grant!  That scene is priceless.  And that is just one of many to follow in the 1958 version.  In the 1988 version, there is Robert Wagner at the bottom of an exquisite staircase looking up at Leslie which should have been played to the T as it was after all Robert Wagner, but he just stands there with this silly fake grin on his face looking idiotic with a very weak hello. And Leslie seems too frothy and stupid. None of the intelligence and naturalness that Bergman and Grant exuded.  Because of the trivalness of the '88 version I found my patience waning and it simply went on far too long, in the original I hated for it to end.  I give this 1988 version one star for effort.  A terrible remake.  But then I seldom like anything from the '70's or '80's genre of movies.  Perhaps it was the sign of the times.  Sorry Mr. Wagner, not one of your best.",1434499200,,1823,4.320588235294117
7824122,4,6302235944,"This movie is so predictable even to the person who didn't watch the original version of this movie years ago. It is fun to watch the story unfold, and even though you know what's going to happen, you enjoy watching the romance unfold.",1433894400,,235,4.488372093023256
7824123,1,6302235944,"I ordered this for my mother who is hard-of-hearing.
It is advertised as having closed-captioning, but it does not have it.
The movie is essentially worthless to her without the CC track.",1402790400,,187,4.875
7824124,5,6302235944,Indiscreet - Leslie-Anne Down and Robert Wagner.  This is one of my favourite movies and I have watched the VHS form countless times and can't understand why it has not been made into a DVD.  I love movies set in London and the scenery and the story are wonderful.  It is fun to watch and also moving.  It is so much better than the original version with Cary Grant.  I love Hart to Hart too but this film of Robert Wagner's is simply the best.,1344470400,3,444,4.176470588235294
7824125,4,6302235944,"Lesley-Anne Down and Robert Wagner do a great job stepping in for Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant. Robert Wagner is a latter day Cary Grant, when we so desperately need one. When he stands at the foot of the staircase looking up at Lesley-Anne Down, we're reminded of Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. This is a well made TV movie with great stars. Wonderfully shot on location in England,it's a great remake of the Bergman/Grant film. Kudos to all.",988243200,7,442,4.6075949367088604
