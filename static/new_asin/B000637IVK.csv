8037791,1,B000637IVK,"If god or any other big religous icon/leader saw this movie, he/she/spirit would rethink of creating the world if he/she/spirit saw this coming. Basicly the formula to make the crapiest movie ever. Showed cliched (clE-shAde) stock photos, unimportant interviews, and No Beatles Music at all (just dumb off-topic spiritaul music, that didn't sound good at all). It's a great way to torture a movie critic, and make him rethink his life.",1141344000,3,435,5.140845070422535
8037792,1,B000637IVK,"This is the worst movie ever concocted! I luckily did not spend money on this; instead it was given to me for Christmas, and because of it i will always concider the Christmas of 2005 to be the worst christmas ever(only joking)! But this really is the biggest waste of money ever. Let me give you a summary of the dvd: First the dvd smells like nail polish remover leading me to suspect these were made in the basement of the actor/ director/narrator/producer. Second: Its not authorized, and the whole thing is made by some akward,pretentious, hippy, with a fake british accent who has the nerve to describe himself as a ""critically acclaimed Beatles historian"" on the back of the movie that he made. Third: There are no beatles songs; only weird native american music with a kazoo, a terrible attempt to create an indian ravi shankar type sound thats extremely vexing and tiresome. Fourth: Besides that lame interview with the beatles at the airport with the Pan American Airlines Logo in the background that everyone in the world has seen,not to mention the sound quality is poor and its cut short, and a lame shot from 3 miles away of Paul McCartney speaking at some seminar, there is no footage of the actual beatles. Fifth: The movie only shows hours of stock photos that have been seen by everyone. Sixth: the hippy who narrated and directed just talks for hours about his take on the beatles. He also attempts to get access of old spots the beatles use to hang around in but cant so he films from miles away. In fact i think out of focus shots from 2 miles away of buildings seems to be a motiff of this dvd. THe best of those crappy shots is a 3 minute zoom from across the street into the window of abbey road studios that the beatles ""might"" have been in when they recorded an album. Seven: the interview with the people who ""kind of"" knew the beatles. When i say kind of, i mean the secratary of the manager(who only worked there for 2 weeks)of the bealtes limo service who once had a chat with Paul Mccartney. And some bartender from Germany whose cousins' roomates' sisters' husbands' best freinds nephews' teachers' fathers' collegues' therpasits' dentists' dog groomers' cleints' dog was once patted on the head by JOhn lennons' aunts' old teacher from grade school. Maby this movie was made just so i could make fun of it. Also its great movie if you need motivation to commit suicide. Oh or if you just want a stylish coaster that smells like nail polish. IN conclusion i think its a great alternative to flushing 14 dollars down the toilet.",1140739200,4,2559,4.5773420479302835
