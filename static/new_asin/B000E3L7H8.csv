It's kind of like Hamlet with the ghost and the warning...except not very good. I love scenes where Bruce Li gets hammered to ease the pain. That's the realness of these movies! From the start, Bruce boast of his fondness (aka 'extreme obsession') over Lee and then someone runs in and informs him ""Bruce Lee is dead"". Watch his face...no one pulls off facial expressions like him! His search for the truth leads Bruce to random fighting, avoiding lusty women (damn vixens!), and lots of vengeful rage. There is the great bus fight where camera decides to show a closeup of the bridge over water before the big ""SPLASH!"". Film school, BAH!! Nothing much gets answered and mediocre battles ensue. Oh man, it's a riot seeing Bruce plastered and hallucination scenes. How much did he drink?? Plus, the fateful flashback of Bruce's last night is so wrong, but another highlight of this one. I didn't know he wore shades while guzzling down Cuervo.

Note: This is NOT Bruce Lee. Bruce Li, my fave in the Bruceploitation genre, helps pull of a fave kampy pleasure here. Watch it for sheer deligh",1525910400,,1162,4.776119402985074
8105120,5,B000E3L7H8,"Another great movie featuring the legendary Ho Chung Tao (aka Bruce Li)!
I have seen at least 10 of the 30 movies that Ho Chung Tao has done. I must say, I have really enjoyed every movie!!
This is no different. Bruce Lee We Miss You is full of fast kicks, deadly punches and sneaky grappling moves. Bruce Li is awesome as he always is in his portrayal of Bruce Lee.
I rate this superb martial arts movie with 5 stars!
Don't miss this one-",1195344000,,439,4.176470588235294
