8158146,5,B000KLPHOS,"Great job by Mantak Chia for those who were looking for techniques to develop the spirit body, energy /yin or yang a must watch. Also those who have read ""The Magus Of Java"" this would be a follow up and well worth the price. Mantak Chia has some great info, i know by using his knowledge and researching them and trying them out. Mantak Chia is very much real in what he teaches, study from other sources you will be surprised that his dvds which are in the open are also the same techniques that are taught in the Wudang schools of neidan, again real stuff!!!

p.s. those who study (sorry to say)real martial arts (internal) this is a must.

p.s.s (all martial arts are designed to bring the person to a spiritual level of training not just punching and kicking, useful in their own right, but ultimately a waste of time. When you develop internal power (real chi storage,spirit power)you will never need to lift a finger ever again and you body will always be at it's best.",1216944000,11,976,4.446927374301676
