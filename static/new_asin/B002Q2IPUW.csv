8472578,1,B002Q2IPUW,"The good news is, the DVD is well filmed and divided up well into chapters.  The bad news is---the techniques are not broken down or discussed at all. What you have is a woman saying-for example-""here is a defense against a punch""....and that is the extent of the discussion. There is no details of how the techs should be done, what they are doing or what the major points are.  And a fair number of the techniques are fairly sloppy.  If I could get my money back I would.
