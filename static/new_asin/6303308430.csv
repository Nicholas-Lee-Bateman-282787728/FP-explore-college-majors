Farrah Fawcett is great in this film...her acting is perfect.
must see!!!!...one of the few films i like to watch and re-watch...over and over.
you will laugh and cry.",1221264000,,259,4.777777777777778
621711,4,6303308430,"Farrah Fawcett, Lea Thompson and Peter Weller all give excellent performances in this sweet little period drama. It's not the most taxing of stories, but has moments of genuine pathos and humour (witness Weller's imitation of an Owl/birdcalls and also highlights the hardship that the early American pioneers and settlers endured.. Farrah plays Pearl a prostitute who is brought in be a 'substitute wife' by Thompsom (as she is dying) for Weller and its interesting to watch as her character undergoes a change from brittle and hard to soft and caring.

A must have for Farrah fans and anyone who likes stories over action.",1169164800,10,623,4.990384615384615
621712,4,6303308430,"I've owned this movie for several years.  It's not a high budget crowning cinematic achievement, but hey I really liked it.  It's probably closer to reality than most people could imagine given the hard lifestyle of the early pioneers.  The homesteader works hard non-stop trying to carve a life for his wife and family, but his wife knows that she has something wrong inside.  An Army doctor confirms her worst fear - cancer - and she doesn't have long.  Concerned for her family and knowing that her children will soon need a new mother she decides to pick a wife and mother for her small children before she dies.  Not an easy task given the small number of available women on the prairie and not much to offer a new wife in the first place.  Newly widowed women are spoken for before their deceased hubands are fully laid to rest.

Her search draws her to town and the soiled dove community where she finds (Welch) plying her trade, worn out and looking for a way out of the oldest profession.

She's only got so much time to teach this prostitute all she will need to know to take her place.  Her husband begins to gradually have feelings for the newcomer, but it's up one day and downhill the next.

No action in this one, but it's just stark reality on the prairie.  More of a girl flick than a guy movie, but you realize at the end of the movie that people didn't have many choices and everyday was a test of survival.",1141344000,20,1426,4.380228136882129
621713,1,6303308430,She apparently had the same disease that Ali MacGraw had in Love Story.  This disease causes the sufferer to get more beautiful as she gets closer to death!,1109721600,3,156,4.571428571428571
621714,5,6303308430,"Given the restrictive social mores of the late 1800's and the incredible fortitude of the pioneer spirit, I find this movie extraordinary. Amy and Pearl, from opposite ends of the social spectrum and totally aware of their realities, stive to accomplish the same purpose. They have the needs and desires of any woman; security, home, family, and especially love. The plot is carried in the dialog--listen carefully. Some may say this is a ""chick flick,"" and yes, I went through a few tissues, but the candid portral of two women who have no illusions left, is brilliantly played by Lea Thompson and Farrah Fawcett.",999734400,4,614,4.913461538461538
621715,5,6303308430,"A pioneer wife and mother's failing health earns her a death sentence, so she sets out to find a new wife and mother for her family. None of the prospects meets her husband's requirement of causing 'the tingle', until she brings home a beautiful prostitute. As her time with her family grows shorter, she teaches the new woman the ways of a farmer's wife and mother, watching the affection grow between the new woman and her husband. But the love between the husband and wife remains, and the tears will flow as the changes come about and the wife suffers more than just physical pain. Definitely a 'box of klennex' video.",979430400,6,622,4.612612612612613
621815,5,6303308430,"This is one of my favorite movies and I watched it every chance I got. Until I lost the DVD. I was beside myself with grief and then decided instead of crying over spilled milk, I would just go on Amazon and order another copy. So you can only imagine my surprise when I saw that this DVD was anywhere between $50-$100!!! What the hell?!?! None of Farrah's other movies are this expensive so it can't be because she died. I WANT this film but I'm not willing to spend such an astronomical amount to get it. This is just pure greed. I'll find someone who already has a copy and have them burn it onto my laptop. The funny part is that none of the other reviewers even mention the crazy price. So either they didn't buy it at this asking price or we have some high rollers on Amazon.com.",1363305600,14,785,4.2052980132450335
621816,4,6303308430,Odd how she played in a movie that parallel her later life. All n all a must see for the true Farrah fan.,1360627200,,105,3.608695652173913
621817,5,6303308430,This was really a good movies.  I had seen it partially on TV but had not seen all of it.  Delivery was prompt.,1360540800,,111,3.782608695652174
621818,5,6303308430,"What would a pioneer woman do when faced with an aggressive cancer and no one around to help her husband maintain the homestead plus keep their young family together? This story line has some interesting twists and turns that include awkward situations seasoned with humor. Excellent acting from Lea Thompson, Peter Weller, and Farrah Fawcett that draws the viewer into the struggle of everyday life of an 19th century prairie homesteader. May make one ponder on the decisions this young woman has to face...I refuse to go on, I may spoil the ending! Well worth watching. If possible, try to find the DVD version, as the VHS version is a bit grainy. I had an opportunity to do so after purchasing the VHS tape and now I am very unhappy with myself!!!",1358467200,2,750,4.6893939393939394
621819,4,6303308430,"Hello, the video is perfect but unfortunately I have determined that the language was English only. Usually in the DVD there are several languages and was hoping to find the Italian language.
This film was not able to find it in Italy and I unfortunately do not speak English and perhaps it is for this reason that I did not understand from your website that the DVD was in English only.
I hope that the translation into English by google was enough to explain my problem.
Thank you.

621820,5,6303308430,"There is simply no way that anybody with any sensitivity at all can not like this movie. I just wish the price of the DVD would come down some. Why is it so expensive?  I have it on VHS and am always afraid that the tape will break or something because I've watched it so many times.  Farah Fawcett is not just a pretty face on a poster for sure. She does a perfect job in this movie. Peter Weller is perfect. I never liked Lea Thompson before but she is wonderful in this.  Now, anybody looking for a shoot em up, bang, bang, blow it up movie will certainly hate this but anybody with any real taste in movies will love it. It's certainly an unusual story but completely believable and a true picture of what life was like on the prairie for ""sod buster"" families. I can't recommend it highly enough. LATER: BTW, I finally was able to obtain a copy of this on DVD from EBAY for 20.00 shipping included. I'm sorry Amazon but your price was just too high this time.",1347494400,4,964,4.2
621821,5,6303308430,"Farah Fawcett is much missed and this movie is very touching, has a bit of comedy and hints at life on the plains in early America that we can't even imagine these days. If you are looking for a movie to make you smile and warm your heart, this is it.",1345593600,2,251,3.9411764705882355
621822,4,6303308430,"I received this DVD in a timely manner & as described. It is an older movie & the picture was not as sharp nor the color as bright as ""todays"" DVDs. I enjoyed seeing the movie again & am glad to have the DVD(I have a VHS copy) To the seller - thank you!",1344211200,,253,3.7037037037037037
621823,5,6303308430,"I'm a huge life long Farrah fan and grew up following her career, I still have my Farrah doll! This is one of Farrah Fawcett's best later movies, I saw it on TV a few times in the 90's on the lifetime channel. I had to get a VHS copy since the old dvd is out of print and very pricey. I don't understand why this hasn't been re released on DVD, it's really a shame Farrah has not been remembered and honored as a icon should be. Nevertheless this is a great movie. The story is a very unique mix of drama, romance, and humor, set in the 1800's a farmers wife learns she will soon die of a illness. She sets out to find a wife to help her husband raise their 4 children and work the family farm. Farrah is great as  a sassy tough prostitute who comes to live with the family. The plot has alot of twist and turns, the music and landscapes are beautiful. Well worth watching and enjoyable for any Farrah Fan. I would also love to get Farrah's 1979 film ""Sunburn"" on dvd.",1282953600,2,968,4.0680628272251305

7843132,5,6303308430,"I have seen this Movie on xfinity free movies for nearly 2 years now but it's expiring in December and I do not know what I'm going to do because I cannot afford it on dvd. I hope Netflix will listen to my pleas soon. This was one of my all time favorite movies and  it stayed in my Heart and I've searched for it for years. I was so happy to see it on my cable service that I cried.  I really came to see that Farrah had become by then an accomplished and fine actress from her breakthrough in the Burning Bed.  Peter Weller is an admirable and broad character in this and he's adorable, my husband quotes him all the time, he knows this movie by heart because I watch this every week while I still can.  To me, the standout is Lea Thompson to have handled this role is amazing.  It's as much a ( non kinky ) love story between the 2 women as much as it is a moral drama about hardships in marriage and in life. The last thing the women say to each other is so poignant if you have a heart it will move you.  I cry when her character dies and cry for Farrah being gone in real life too.  For anyone who can afford this I highly recommend it.",1408838400,2,1142,3.9391304347826086
7843133,1,6303308430,"I watched it today and it just made me feel sick. The acting was good but the way her husband slept with Farrah while his wife was still alive in the other room turned me off to this movie. It wasn't a romantic movie at all to me. I think most women would go crazy seeing their husband with another woman while they were dying, I know I would!",1397174400,5,343,3.9855072463768115
7843134,4,6303308430,"I remembered the movie from years ago, that it was a nice historical drama depicting the pioneer movement, and the trials of a family faced with a parents fatal disease.
