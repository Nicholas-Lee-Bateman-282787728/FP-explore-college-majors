8193010,3,B000PS8UI6,"The reason I purchased this movie is that my cousin, Anne Lise Christiansen, is in it.  The story line is pretty hokey and predictable/formulaic and you don't need to understand spoken Norwegian to get the basic plot [girl masquerading as boy, two characters who look alike]. Unless you have a family connection with one of the actors, you probably won't be interested in this film.  It was fun for me to see it because I'd heard so much about it.",1380844800,,447,4.575
