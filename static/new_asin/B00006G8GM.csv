7968274,2,B00006G8GM,"This DVD isn't awful, don't get me wrong. It's just that it seems a bit stuffed with filler rather than promising `outrageous' clips.

Most of the good material has been viewed to death anyway by other sources (the internet for example). The kickboxing `break a leg' still makes my eyes water, so do the rodeo moments and the arm wrestle straight from the Cronenberg's The Fly.

However, beyond that, there is little else to amaze. Unless you think naked sky diving is `outrageous' then I would suggest you either look elsewhere for clips that are `too hot for TV'.

I do not feel you get real value for money. Most of the time, the clips are replayed again and again in slow motion. If you think that repetition is an ideal substitute for substance, then buy it.

I bought this on Amazon UK and have tried to sell it THREE times with no success (at a low price).

Being fair, I suggest trying to renting it first to see for yourself.",1142294400,4,934,4.43859649122807
7968275,4,B00006G8GM,"Wow.... What a dvd of goofs and mishaps, Some of the clips were to sick and made me feel queesy. But i enjoyed it. If you want a sports dvd that shows the Graphic conclusions on what can go wrong well buy this.",1045267200,,210,3.9069767441860463
