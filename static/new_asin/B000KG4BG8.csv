8156411,4,B000KG4BG8,"This film begins with a very promising theme: The heroine, Marta, visits multiple pay telephones in Italy and uses a magnetic pickup coil to make recordings of telephone calls with a reel-to-reel tape recorder. She wants very much to be a telephone operator, so she trains very hard to learn the craft and then applies for a job with the Telephone Company. Marta is not blessed with the most pleasant telephone voice, but lands the job because she says she has no interest in ever getting married.

Besides working as a Directory Assistance operator, Marta has other passions, including a love of pasta. Along with her roommate, Marta goes though several men, before eventually marrying one of them. At first, the husband seems too good to be true. Sure enough, he ultimately leaves her to sail around the world with his old boyfriend from Germany (the flair for upholstery should have given her a clue).

Unfortunately, there's not very much telephone operating featured in the movie, and I'm left hungry for some of Marta's spaghetti with oil, garlic and fresh basil. Still, it's rather fun and campy. Worth watching!",1360281600,11,1119,4.915343915343915
8156412,5,B000KG4BG8,"I love this story!  If you are a John Phillip Law fan, you'll be thrilled to see his performance as a ""good Italian boy"" determined to wait until his wedding night for the big event.  His performance is so disarming and the only negative part of this film is that JPL isn't in it enough.",1169510400,5,287,4.2
