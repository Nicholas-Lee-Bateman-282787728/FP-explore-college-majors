201821,5,1629971804,"I have enjoyed many of The Great Courses series, and Professor Liulevicius is a perfect example of why. He is a leading scholar on the subject at hand, while also being engaging, inspiring, and entertaining. The good news is that he has produced several series with The Great Courses. I listened to his series called History's Greatest Voyages of Exploration on Audible.com. Now after watching this one, I am eager to check out his others!

This approach to history is wonderful. It manages to be both deep in content and entertaining at the same time. This is not some History Channel special filled with fake ""reenactments."" What you get is more like a great college course (but without the homework): a prominent scholar telling fascinating and detailed stories supported by maps, historical illustrations, and photos, then tying it together in a highly organized way that helps you see the big picture threads tying it all together. Discussing why they qualify as turning points is half the fun.

Highly recommended.",1429833600,,1020,5.029585798816568
201822,4,1629971804,"A brief overview of the fall of Constantinople.  It was a major turning point in world history.  If you want more detail there is a very good book ""1453"" which gives a lot more detail and broader understanding of exactly how this happened.",1429488000,,239,4.534883720930233
201823,5,1629971804,"This is the most interesting and fun history series I've ever watched! Many of the turning points are topics that are glossed over in traditional history classes and books. Other topics are given a fresh outlook by Prof. Liulevicius. He asks thought-provoking questions about many of the turning points and the examines the results.

This is a series for the history lover and also those who think they don't like history--Prof. Liulevicius is a natural speaker; very easy to listen to. I got so much more out of this than I expected.",1418774400,,534,4.804347826086956

7800594,5,1629971804,"This video courses provides an in-depth look at major events, and thus has breadth and depth. Events from Asia, Europe, and America are examined with much clarity, and I found a new appreciation for turning points such as the Gutenberg Press, the Treaty of Westphalia, the founding of the American Republic. In general, I found this more intriguing than reading about these events.

Part of what makes the course so good is that events are clearly explained, put in context, and related to the contemporary world. For example, the professor speaks about past and contemporary republics, which often struggled to maintain stability, in the lecture on the American Experiment Overall, it's sufficiently well done that I'm looking for more DVDs by this professor.",1431993600,,760,5.178861788617886
