7900022,1,7799711817,"I ordered this DVD set through Amazon from the from Asian Entertainment vendor who describes the DVDs as having ""Korean Audio with Good ENG subs.""

First of all, the product received did not match the picture. The picture on the product information page has the POH KIM or PK Entertainment stamp. I've purchased POH KIM/PK Entertainment discs before and have been very happy with the picture/sound/subs and case.

I was surprised at what arrived in the mail since I was expecting something different. I think the company who published this version of Baby Faced Beauty is called VOV (never heard of them before). Twenty episodes on three discs, individually wrapped in plastic liners, held in one case that had all three discs on the same nub (the nub, not sure exactly what it's called, just poked through the plastic liner of all three discs). The dvd case had serious typos on the cover and a ""love"" sticker over the bluray logo on the cover (these were not bluray discs). Sloppy production.

As far as the discs are concerned, disc one had an error on the menu (episodes 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5 and 8 were available for selection, obviously they meant episode 6). If you selected skip, it would skip to the next episode instead of the next chapter of the episode. Cannot rewind past the beginning of the episode to the end of the previous episode (had to return to the main menu to select episode and then fast forward). Every episode defaulted to the Chinese subs so if you selected English subs, once the next episode began, you had to re-select Eng subs.

Everything above, disappointing, but I was very happy with the picture quality, sound and English subs. Then I got to episode 13 and the English subs turned to gibberish. No longer a proper translation. For instance, ""Director Park"" was translated to ""White River"" or something like that. Translation was either missing or so poorly translated, one couldn't make sense of what was being said.

I skipped ahead to scan the next couple of episodes...more gibberish. I'm not sure if the English translation ever improved beyond that, I couldn't finish watching. I'm returning this version published by VOV and will be looking online for the version published by POH KIM.

Not sure if the other vendors are actually selling the POH KIM version pictured on the product info page. If not, the picture AMAZON is using on the product info page should be updated because it's very misleading.",1362528000,3,2437,4.749408983451537
7900023,1,7799711817,"I called the Korean broadcasting company, KBS, and asked them if this is an authentic product or not.

They said ""NO."" Those dramas are sold only through their website, not anywhere else.",1338508800,,187,4.84375
7900024,4,7799711817,"Just finished watching this K-drama.  It was pretty predictable; good-hearted, overworked unni gains the love/admiration of two princes - otoke?, but the characters had a lot of heart.  The little girl was a real scene stealer; extremely cute and believable. Choi Daniel (Jin Wook) played his part with a realistic exuberant and slightly naive flair.  His unstinting care and love for Ryu Jin's (So Young)character really was the heart of the series.  The ending was a picture perfect postcard of the future couple's happiness...very sweet!

While this kdrama is fluffy, I still found myself rooting for the characters and cussing the vindictive antagonists that continously found ways to torture So Young.
If you need some downtime, this romance fits the bill, and is great entertainment.",1326844800,2,789,5.28
