The movie will start in Spanish, just press the language button on your remote control and a pop-up will appear on screen and allow you to select English.

The movie was originally shot in English, and you will be bypassing the dubbed Spanish.

A wonderful pre-code movie. Highly recommend.

The movie was shipped promptly by DaaVeeDee.  Arriving in about 3 days.",1413590400,,425,5.014285714285714
