4595320,1,B0057FGD54,"Another venomous portrayal by the shallow ignorant airheads of filmmaking that presents the religious as shallow, ignorant, simple-minded, jealous, depraved, grotesquely selfish, and hysterically deluded about the existence of miracles. Buy this video if you're an unconscionable, airheaded anti-Catholic bigot. This applies even to Catholic anti-Catholic bigots. You'll love it.",1327968000,9,379,6.6
4595321,4,B0057FGD54,"This is a nice little film. It is relatively short (just over an hour and a half). Not a lot happens (except for one miracle of sorts). The pace is slow, even by Euro standards. But it is extremely pleasant and well worth a watch. The acting is excellent, including some of the less-noticeable minor characters, like the various invalid pilgrims and those who assist them. The visuals are lovely, and the film truly captures the atmosphere of being in Lourdes. There are many beautiful scenes of mountains, basilicas, processions, meals at table, and visits to the grotto-- all captured reverently, but not preachingly. That is perhaps the film's greatest point: it opens us up to the possibilities of faith, but also leads us to inquire how the spirit moves in our own lives. It is not a ""religious"" film at all, with all the preaching and dogmatics that might imply. But nor is it another simple screed against the limits of religion and the stupidity of those who believe. To the contrary, this film holds open the possibilities of faith, while at the same time reminding us that life-- in this life, and in the realm of belief-- can be complicated and seldom as simple as proponents on either side might like us to think.",1317254400,18,1225,4.675925925925926

8460591,5,B0057FGD54,"Although it's a shame that this film isn't available through Amazon's streaming service, it is worth the effort to purchase on DVD. This wonderful little French-language film explores many facets of humanity, including religion and faith-healing, but does so with a soft touch.",1440374400,,277,5.465116279069767

8460593,5,B0057FGD54,"This fictional film is about a modern-day paralyzed pilgrim's experience at Lourdes. This particular pilgrim was not deeply devout or religious. The film is very appealing to those who have never been to Lourdes. It gives a glimpse as to what happens when there is an alleged cure, and how fellow pilgrims in a tour group react to a cure. The film makes you want to go to Lourdes, maybe not so much for a cure, but just to experience Lourdes. Very well done film. I can see why this film has won awards. The end leaves you wondering too.",1363478400,2,537,4.38
8460594,1,B0057FGD54,"I actually liked the movie going in even though it was unpleasant but at the end it had me upset and the end does not make sense. I looked it up myself to see what the reaction is,it is NOT an Catholic Movie,Yes The Pilgrimage to Lourdes is nicely portrayed but the end leaves alot to be desired and seems to be an Anti-Catholic piece when you think deep,I saw it on Netflix and was very pleased thinking by the sound of the plot/description and going in,but I believe it portrays the Church in an Negative and Typical way that has been done ad-verbatim since the start against the Church. Secularists and Athiests and Non-Catholics and AntiCatholics and Soft Catholics might enjoy it or those that can't read between the lines.",1360108800,6,728,4.564885496183206
8460595,2,B0057FGD54,"This movie was an enormous let down. I had read nothing about the movie and knew absolutely nothing about it, so as I started watching it I was pleasantly surprised by how well shot and well acted it was. The pace was slow but smooth, every gesture with meaning, and the shots well framed and beautiful. That is what earned it two stars - that extra star is due to the hard work of the director. If I could give it two and a half stars, I would. But it doesn't really deserve three.

~*SPOILERS AHEAD - If you have not watched this movie yet and don't want it spoiled, stop reading here.*~

I really loved this film, up until roughly the last fifteen minutes. I am a staunch Roman Catholic. I had absolutely no problem with how brutally realistic the movie was - it was done in a tasteful way, and there seemed to be a solid understanding of morals throughout the film with realistic consequences for people's actions. The young and somewhat selfish female volunteer who slept with one of the male volunteers soon saw that man slip through her grasp. The gossiping, envious old shrews did not have their prayers answered, no matter how ""devout"" they pretended to be. The pious old woman of few words who spent most of her time in prayer and performing acts of charity helped to facilitate a miracle - almost. That is the really annoying part of this movie - the *almost* miracles. Halfway through the film when ""miracles"" began happening in an understated, extremely touching manner, I thought that this was going to be one of the best religious films that had come out in the last few years. But then, when they all mysteriously undo themselves, and the writer decides that miracles don't exist, that God likely doesn't exist (and if He does, He is not a kind and just God), that life is ultimately meaningless, random, and cruel, the film lost me.

Here's the thing - there are countless films with the exact same anti-Catholic, anti-Christian, anti-religious message. There is nothing unique, edgy, or clever about this kind of plot twist. There are a plethora of such movies out there, but at least most of them are honest as to what their message is from the very beginning, so that someone who has religious convictions can dump the film a few minutes in as soon as the tomfoolery starts. The fact that this movie's focus is on a site where Our Lady has appeared in recent memory, a site that is quite dear to Roman Catholics the world over, a site that has been the source of countless miracles, obviously leads any Catholic to believe that this movie will be focused on miraculous happenings and God's Love for mankind. Instead, I got to waste an hour and a half of my life on a film that denigrates my faith, much like almost every other movie to come out in the last forty or so years.

To those who are arguing that the ending was ""ambiguous"" - no it wasn't. There are countless clues in the dialogue and behavior of the surrounding characters, as well as the main character, that show the writer clearly intended to give the impression that no miracle had occurred and/or that God is some cruel, distant being. The only way it could be clearer is if the priest himself had gotten up on the stage and said ""Sorry folks, no miracles here, let's just go home and turn to a life of hedonism because our religion is obviously superstitious nonsense and God doesn't care anyway.""

In short, if you are a committed atheist or secularist, you'll probably love this movie. Everyone else will likely feel cheated.",1359072000,10,3515,4.555379746835443
8460596,4,B0057FGD54,"As most persons know,  the grotto in Lourdes was the site where St. Bernadette saw visions of the Virgin Mary; its waters (from time to time) have reputedly caused miracles of healing. Because of this history/reputation, thousands of pilgrims come from all over the world for the chance to get healed.  As a photo-essay on Lourdes, this film is splendid. As a viewer, I truly had a sense that I had ""visited"" the site - from its beautiful church to the peaceful landscapes.  But the film offers much more than that.

This is the story of a tour group which comes to Lourdes and one of its members does get miraculously cured.  Apparently she appears to be a woman of little faith and rather self-absorbed. Nevertheless, ""she"" is the one chosen (by God) to be healed.  The theme of the film is the reaction/change of the individual faced with this new development in her life as well as the reaction of all those who witness the incident...other members of the group, the priest, the medical authorities in Lourdes, the caretakers.  The theological question is why did she get cured over those in more need, those who are unselfish, those who are strong believers in the faith.

The film does not answer those questions, but rather poses them.  But I think it does a terrific job of accurately depicting the range of reactions to the event of a miracle...including not a little jealously, rage, or even disbelief.

Be on notice that this is an unusually slow film...its action unfolds mostly in eyes and facial expressions of the participants...and in that it is very well done. It is also a movie about ritual - not just religious ritual - but the ritual of daily life  (from the partaking of communal meals to the procedures for putting a person with multiple sclerosis into bed to the timing of prayers).  It is a movie which provokes us to examine how well we live our lives.",1332028800,8,1878,4.640483383685801
8460597,5,B0057FGD54,"An intimate look at the ambivalent and contested nature of miracles, pilgrimage and sacred sites. The film discloses with ethnographic precision the inner and outer conflicts surrounding what apparently seems to be a miraculous healing.",1331078400,2,236,5.771428571428571
8460598,4,B0057FGD54,"You know the town of Lourdes and its religious background. The seemingly simple story of the third film of Austrian director Jessica Hausner (""Lovely Rita"" and ""Hotel"") takes place in this small French town in the beautiful Pyrenees Mountains, where pilgrims from all over the world visit for the spring water that is believed to have healing powers. A young woman Christine (Sylvie Testud, Marion Cotillard's ""La Vie en rose"") is among them.

Not much is shown about Christine in the film, except that she is among the group of people making pilgrimages to the Grotto. She is in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the neck down, but after staying a few days something happens to her. Is this a miracle? Or a remission? And, more importantly, why her?

""Lourdes"" is open to more than one interpretation. It neither confirms nor denies. The observant film slowly unfolds the spiritual and the worldly sides of the characters, among whom some sort of equilibrium is attained. Maria, a young volunteer (played by La Seydoux, memorable as deadly assassin in ""Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocol"") seems more interested in a young male volunteer. It seems Mrs. Hartl (Gilette Barbier), who is frequently seen attending to Christine, joined the pilgrimage not because of illness. The delicate equilibrium surrounding Christine and other people is poised to change.

To me, ""Lourdes"" is less about a miracle than what it (or our hopes for one) brings to us. The film is slow-moving, but with downplayed humor, well-drawn characters played with nuanced acting, and beautiful on-location shots of Lourdes, the film is an engrossing experience.",1329523200,4,1628,5.1358490566037736
8460599,4,B0057FGD54,Why does God favor some and not others? This seems to be the question this movie asked. The movie is not preachy but seems to be made with a wider audience in mind. Miracles real or auto-suggested? This movie leaves it open to your own belief. I choose to believe in the miracle. I really liked the movie and did not find it anti-catholic as one reviewer suggested.,1329523200,2,365,4.382352941176471
