2557884,4,B000FA57I0,"If the Mavericks win the NBA crown,I will definely buy this DVD because they had a real good playoff series against the defending champs the San Antonio Spurs. I would love to see those highlights over and over again and it time for a new Texas team to hold the trophy up so I hope the Mavericks can be the Heat because this will be a great DVD.

2557982,5,B000FA57I0,"CAN YOU DIG IT?? WORLD  CHAMPIONS!!!!!!!!!! it was a Fantastic Finish to a Season that highs, lows&everything in  between. Pat Riley Came back&lead the charge.  Dwyane Wade became a SuperStar&Entered Legendary Status. Shaquille O'Neal added to His Legacy&then some. Great for Alonzo Mourning,Gary Payton, Tonie Walker,Haslem,&The Rest of the Team on Winning it all. Hopefully we can Repeat. this was a Huge Win. Shaq&Pat Riley shut up there critics. Jewlery Night is coming up in October. Can't wait for ring night. this DVD is a Must have for Miami Heat fans. 15 strong is the theme.",1155945600,2,584,5.0625
2557983,5,B000FA57I0,"HEAT FANS, GET READY! While the DVD is a bit brief, as in not including entire games, the DVD certainly delivers the excitement and insight into HEAT basketball. It cuts to the core of the HEAT'S rise to the Championship.

Like most NBA DVDS, it focuses on the human level as well as showing great action, particularly once it gets into the playoffs. The only thing I wish was some more feedback from the other team's players and how they rate the HEAT.

The film includes a couple brief bios on some of the players, as well as the 4th Quarter of Game 6.

All in all, certainly worth it, but don't expect entire NBA game coverage.",1153526400,4,630,4.367521367521367
2557984,5,B000FA57I0,"I am truly going to enjoy this DVD as the Miami Heat culminate their season with a championship.  When the ""Heat"" were down 2-0 to the ""Mavs"", I never lost hope.  I had a ""gut"" feeling that Senor Wade would recover from his illness and carry his team to the title.  How sweet it was to watch a supposedly ""superior"" team as the ""Mavs"" (lead by Dirk and owner Cuban) lose to the ""Heat"".  I can invision watching this DVD over and over.  Go ""Heat"" and sulk all you ""Mav"" fans!",1151280000,5,474,4.164835164835165

Wade early on in his prime rolling with shaq diesel, gary payton, jason williams and the list goes on. through the good, bad and ugly persevering through it all to get to the top.",1456704000,,447,4.333333333333333
