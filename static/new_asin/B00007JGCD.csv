1814120,4,B00007JGCD,Good product.  Has met up to my expectation from Amazon.  Thank you.,1124323200,,68,4.583333333333333
1814121,3,B00007JGCD,"In all honesty, this version of the familiar story is a bit too much. A bit too much graphic sex that is. I was actually embarassed for the actors while watching the sex scenes. And running about the meadow naked? That's a brave pair of actors!!!And while I think most women have no objection to seeing Mr. Bean's (Sean that is-NOT Rowan Atkinson) backside, I did not relish seeing it in constant motion (if you know what I mean). I think all of the sex got in the way of the love story. I didn't feel the love growing between Mellors and Lady Chatterly. The relationship seemed to go from sexual obscession devoid of love to sacrificial love in 0-3 seconds.

Parts of this film were reminiscent of cheesy old pornos with all of the noisy sex and unfitting music.

I suppose if titilating sex scenes are your interest, then you will like this film. But if you are easily embarassed or offended by the above described material you would do better to avoid seeing this one.",1109203200,8,971,4.480225988700565
1814122,4,B00007JGCD,"Joely Richardson is repressed Constance Chatterly, married to an embittered, paralyzed man (James Wilby) who suggests she take on a lover, the earthy, lowly, gamekeeper Oliver Mellors (Sean Bean).

Ken Russell's LADY CHATTERLY (Acorn), is a faithful adaptation of D. H. Lawrence's controversial novel that was the center of the 20th Century's most celebrated obscenity trial. Russell's film does not shy away from bold, passionate love scenes that include full frontal nudity.  He pulls out all the appropriate stops in this nearly four hour (2 disc) BBC production that lets us not only understand but sympathize with all the principals in the adulterous affair.

Don't be misled into thinking this is a staid and proper (read boring) British mini-series.  Joely Richardson's brave performance as the repressed wife whose passions are awakened made this one of the most talked about TV movies of the 90s.

Don't miss this exquisite, intelligent adaptation of a true literary classic with all the heat intact.",1106870400,4,1009,5.28125
1814123,5,B00007JGCD,"Oooooh! This is one great video! It's hot, it's spicy, and it's seriously well made and well written, which gives you a great excuse to watch it--you can say you're watching it for its artistic merit, instead of just admitting that you bought it to perve on Sean Bean's (Lord of the Rings) gorgeous bottom! (Or Joely Richardson's bits, if you'd rather.)

The cast is lovely, the script intelligent, the scenery opulent, and the plot intriguing. Need I say more? Watch it, preferably with your significant other. You won't be disappointed.",1106438400,19,538,4.912087912087912

I just finished it and I am not disappointed. What a great story! I do believe that the sex scenes are far from being shocking, they are justified, intense and beautiful. The previous reviews say it all - great story, adaptation, characters... over 200 minutes very, very well spent. I'll let the tears dry now.",1068595200,19,442,4.67948717948718
1814125,5,B00007JGCD,"This adaption of D.H. Lawrence has fairly explicit content, for a BBC adaption, and certainly won't be on Masterpiece Theatre, any time soon; at least, without some heavy editing.  Ms. Richardson displays quite a bit of flesh, in this adaption, as does Mr. Bean
(not the one played by Rowan Atkinson) and there are a few suprising inclusions of the most infamous word (we all know what that is) in the English language.  Wilby is sufficiently stuff, bitter, and arrogant as Lord Chatterley.  Bean is rough, yet tender, as Mellors; and Richardson is delicate but very sexy, as Lady Chatterley, and she has an attractive but stuffy sister, who could do with a bit of what Constance got.  Worth a definite look.",1064188800,4,708,4.778688524590164

1814233,4,B00007JGCD,"So, you must remember that the films of Ken Russell are always like a big gooey chocolate cake, wonderful, beautiful, and you have to enjoy them for their 'over the topness '. He's very '60's' if you know what I mean. The music is sometimes overwhelmingly 'twee', just a bit much. It won't spoil it for you. Take the dream sequence with the 'flowers in the hair running naked in the rain thing' with a grain of salt, THAT stuff is pure Ken Russell. Keep in mind the giddy, ' Hell in a hand basket 'atmosphere of the 20's and it will get you past a few of the remarks of Lady Chatterly that seem flippant. As far as the actors, everyone's brilliant, a really fine reworking of D. H.'s scandalous novel with a depth of portrayal by Sean Bean that leaves you empathizing with him more than any other character, and of course the love scenes are to die for, all thanks again to Mr. Bean.",1424304000,3,883,4.293413173652695

1814271,5,B00007JGCD,"Though certain scenes/themes are changed from the book and the ending is completely different, this mini-series is fantastic.  The acting is great, Sean Bean is hot, Clifford is sympathetic and annoying.  In the book, the whole story is framed around Clifford and his intellectual friends.  However, Clifford's friends did not make it into the series, nor did Michaelis, Lady Chatterley's first love affair from the book.  Michaelis was an important character because ultimately, it is his selfishness that makes Lady Chatterley completely lose touch with sensuality so it needs to be reawakened.  There are many other things lost in translation; however, the series does a very good job of illustrating the class divide and Clifford's ignorance toward humanity.

However, compared to other versions it is, to this viewer, very 'PG"" in nature.  Perhaps the director was loathe to deal with Amer. rating systems so the final 'cut' ends up losing much of the richness and authenticity which this reviewer believes the novel's writer intended for his audience.

1814328,5,B00007JGCD,"It's not commonly acknowledged, perhaps because the old dispute about obscenity still makes people nervous even though the book would be considered mild by contemporary standards.  But the story of Lady Chatterley is comparable to many of Shakespeare's plays in terms of human interest, complex characters and complex motivations for the characters, and many ways the story can be shaped by emphasis in production.  This film has some complex and very interesting ways of telling the story.",1382659200,,490,5.35064935064935

Therefore, I am not surprised I did not like this series.  I did not find the acting very good.  Sean Bean was a nice looking, sexual man but his scenes with Joley Richardson were dull.  There was no chemistry between them.  James Wilby, who plays the husband, was playing a James Wilby character - he didn't have to act too hard.

Honestly?  Boring production.  Unrealistic ending - even if it was part of one of D.H. Lawrence's books.  Not one to watch.",1367625600,,589,4.321100917431193

1814334,5,B00007JGCD,"For any one living on the moon who has never heard of Lady Chatterley, let me tell you the book was band in the time it was written. A married woman takes a lover at the request of her paraplegic husband to produce an heir. She falls in love and is torn between duty and the love of her life. He is poor, treated less as less than human by society. She is a lady. Her husband a high born snob. An emotional piece. Leave your husband out of this one.",1355702400,2,449,3.9450549450549453
1814335,4,B00007JGCD,"""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" was the naughty book that got passed around American junior high schools in the 1960's.  Little did we adolescents know that the real reasons the book was challenging and controversial had not to do with sex, but with class distinctions.

D.H. Lawrence remains an author worthy of study because of his passionate examination of the dehumanization inflicted by class structures, as well as his provocative belief in the subversive power of sex.  ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" in some respects isn't that far removed from George Orwell's ""1984"", in that it posits sex and humanity as redemptive forces in the face of oppression.

In this film version of ""Lady Chatterley"", director Ken Russell (who had earlier triumphed with his adaptation of Lawrence's ""Women in Love"") makes his (or Lawrence's) points without being too heavy-handed.  Scenes taking place in the rustic beauty of the Chatterley estate are nearly Edenic, with music supplied by Frederick Delius and other pastoralists.  (It's interesting that when Lady Chatterley embarks on the shaky ground of her affair with Mellors, the score changes to Gustav Holst's ""The Planets"" ).  When Russell shows the condition of the lower class miners, he leaches most of the color from the scenes to illustrate the dreary contrast of their lives.

It's also instructive to see how deftly Russell/Lawrence reveals the psychology of Lady Chatterley's affair.  Lord Chatterley, physically debilitated, encourages his wife to have an affair in order be provided with an heir.  Chatterley eases the burden on his wife by hiring a nurse (""Mrs. Bolton""), who we gradually witness taking on the role of a surrogate wife.  Although Mrs. Bolton presents the appearance of being sympathetic to Lady Chatterley's dilemma (her confinement in a loveless marraige), Mrs. Bolton secretly covets the role of Mrs. Chatterley and dreams of replacing her.

Lady Chatterley herself is an idealist, who as she gives herself over to Mellors the gamekeeper, gradually changes to a wanton sensualist.  She comes to see her relationship with Mellors as the fulfillment of love in a natural, unrestrained state.  But as a ""liberated female"", Lady Chatterley must make the decision to renounce her material and social standing.  Mellors pays a much heavier price for his transgression against class and propriety.

At the heart of it is the belief in Darwinian superiority that Lord Chatterley utters, waging war (in full military regalia) on the lower class.  He berates Mellors as a ""half-animal"", and proclaims that ""we are the bosses"" that are vested with the power to order the slovenly lower class minions about.

Unbelievably, nearly a century later, these ugly sentiments are still just beneath the surface of our current political strife.

Kudos to the actors/performers in this movie--especially to the ballsy performance by a young Joely Richardson, who seems to have added some pounds in order to play the sensual ""English Rose"", Lady Chatterley.",1355097600,2,3000,5.264705882352941
1814376,4,B00007JGCD,"Lady Chatterley's Lover was a banned book for so long in Britain that it because a cause celebre for easing censorship. After a long court case, the book was finally released, but what many overlooked was that this story was more about the class differences than the sex. In a time when one could not rise above one's class no matter how accomplished and educated, it was not the fact that Connie was committing adultery, after all, her husband had even suggested that she take a lover as he wanted an heir, and Mellors was not her first lover - it was that she was having an affair with a member of the lower class - a servant of all things! A betrayal of her class! That Mellors was quite well educated and had risen way above his origins, becoming an officer in the Indian Army, did not matter - ""he isn't one of us!"". After WWI he had returned to his hometown and would always be branded a member of the lower class. The only way to escape his origins was to emigrate.

Ken Russell had previously filmed Lawrence's Women in Love, and The Rainbow, so it is hardly surprising to find him taking on Lady Chatterley.  The incredibly versatile Sean Bean makes a superb Mellors, not least because he has the right accent, comes from that part of Britain, and exudes masculinity from every pore. He successfully displays the contempt for the idea of the class structure, rather than the people born into it. Millions had died in a terrible war which decimated the upper class and caused massive social upheaval, yet the workers were expected to go back to their place in life as it was before. Mellors has as much contempt for the lower class for accepting the status quo as he does for the upper class who make the rules. He really wants nothing to do with either group, but his affair with Connie is seen as a threat by both sides.

Joely Richardson is also worth a mention and does not overplay her role of the wartime bride from a more liberal background who discovered that to marry in haste is to repent at leisure.

The real star, in a supporting role, is Shirley Ann Field, as the social climbing nurse companion, Mrs. Bolton, who slyly encourages the affair as she sees her opportunity to become indispensable to Clifford, and thus, to rise above her station as far as possible. Not a servant, but almost one of the family. She is well aware that under normal circumstances Sir Clifford would never associate with her socially or consider her anything other than the paid help, but an opportunity has presented itself for her to mix with the gentry almost as a revered childhood nanny, and she is going to make the most of it. I got the feeling that if Connie had given up Mellors and decided to stay with Clifford, Mrs. Bolton might have soaped the stairs. Shirley Ann Field came from a difficult childhood in Lancashire, UK, to become a great beauty and popular actress in working class dramas. In this film she shows that she is more than a pretty face. I would recommend this film for its lovely photography as well as excellent acting.",1345161600,2,3046,4.502712477396022

But if Sean Bean wasn't in this movie it would get 1 star. I was always hesitant on watching this movie and now I see why. Last night I watch this movie and I didn't like it. Their are things I didn't like about this movie. First their was no chemistry between Sean Bean and Joely Richardson. For a I moment saw it, but then it went away whey they put to much, like Sean said it best in the movie ""f***ing"" scenes in the movie. Because you can't call it love making,you just can't .I felt more chemistry between Connie sister and Olivier when they met for the first time and had a argument on why he not the man for her sister. And he told her off. Then some of the times I had to fast forward because it was getting to be boring. Then I didn't like Connie played by Joely Richardson constant whining throughout the movie,if I you are going to comment adultery you should at least be confident and not whiny. A few times I had to fast forward her parts she was really getting on my nerves. In the movie did like the relationship between Connie and her sister had with each other. Even though they were different they still had each other backs. Then after ""f******"" Mr. Mellors 3 times she finds out his name,finds out he is also in a loveless marriage,  and oh yeah then poof she spitting out she loves him. How in the hell can you be in love after ""f******"" someone 3 times? I don't call it love, I call more like infatuated or lust. And then Connie getting jealous for him having a picture of his wife hanging in the hut were they ""f***"" at and were he lives at, when he already told her his wife didn't love him and she left him. I really felt that was a stupid part in the movie,if I was Connie I'm not going to get jealous if something or someone who isn't their. Out mind out of sight, honey. I wish they had more tender scenes in the being and less ""f******"" scenes in back of the movie instead of the other way around, it was back wards. I didn't feel any passion or the love. This is not a romance movie I felt that this story had no substance I didn't see the love growing between Oliver and Connie. And that were I'm more disappointed at, I just didn't feel the love between the two. I wish they had gotten to know more about each other. I wouldn't buy this movie watch it on YouTube like I did or rent it from the library. But if you want to see more love,more passion, and more tenderness in a movie go watch Harlequien Romance movies or Danielle Steel's movies on YouTube or you can find it right here on Amazon.

Not only did he directed and co-wrote an adaptation from a very controversial novel who exists in three different versions, though the third is the most common in bookstores, Ken Russell combined elements from the second and from the third version, mixing together only the best elements and keeping the same story together. Like he says in the interview on the dvd, he tried to remain in the spirit of the novel.

Great compliments go to all the actors, including Joely Richardson and Sean Bean, whose chemistry is perfect. Thanks to that, it makes the relationship between all characters believable.

Though the music soundtrack is not the same as the one used during the original broadcasts, apart from the diegetic music played on the piano or on the saxophone by the characters, I found the public-domain music used on the dvd very good. Though it would have been nice to know from Ken Russell in his interview which english composers he used for his original broadcast.

Anyway, an excellent tv series to watch.",1253836800,3,1092,4.797872340425532
1814382,5,B00007JGCD,"This miniseries is a superb retelling, on film, of the magnificent novel by D.H. Lawrence, which was banned from his homeland, Britain, and the United States, for thirty years.  A few changes were made in the plot, as the ending of the book is a long letter by the ""lover,"" which was not deemed dramatic enough for a film. Also, the place Connie vacationed was changed from Venice to some unidentified European beach, filled with sunshine, unlike the drab Midlands which was the main setting.

Almost every actor personifies to perfection the characters in the book, but the one most exactly like the novel is the actress who plays Mrs. Bolton, the nurse. Clifford Chatterley (James Wilby),his wife Connie (Joely Richardson), and the Gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors (Sean Bean) are excellent as the main characters. I didn't think all the changes were necessary, but they were minor compared with the over-dramatized ending.

It is impossible for any movie to capture the essence of Lawrence's philosophy, his hatred of modern life and the industrialism that casts a blight on almost all of nature and humanity. In contrast, the ""natural man,"" portrayed by the sensual, iconoclastic Mellors, is one of the last, best hopes for spiritual survival. For Lawrence,sex was a sacred thing, so it is doubly ironic that this marvelous work has been banned for so long due to a few Anglo-Saxon words and unequalled descriptions of female sexuality.  My advice is to see this beautiful film and then read or re-read an unexpurgated copy of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover.""  (Some parts of the film were taken from earlier versions of this infamous novel, which I have also read, ""The First Lady Chatterley"" and ""John Thomas and Lady Jane."")",1252713600,2,1719,4.996503496503497

They used to be intelectually compatible... but, is that enough to allow Constance to silence her young body and live out the rest of her life entombed in the Challerley mansion? Can Lord Chatterley combat his jealousy in order to fulfill his desire for an heir? Well, enter Mellors, the gamekeeper...

While young Sean Bean and Joely Richardson (lately of the ""Nip and Tuck"" fame) create great sexual chemistry on screen, their innocence and a degree of naivete prevent this adaptation from turning into a sordid tale of an affair. Yes, the writing and the direction are a bit choppey and do not raise to the same level of mastery as the novel. Yes, you do wish the director would have abandoned his desire to act (he cast himself as Constance's father). Still, the charisma of the two leads makes this adaptation a fantastic watch and a great companion to the book. And just like the leads in real life, the series has aged well and remains relevant to a 21st century viewer. Ejoy!

1814384,5,B00007JGCD,"Just after WWI, Sir Clifford Chatterley has inherited a large country estate and a title.  He is happily married to the beautiful Connie.  All would be wonderful, except Clifford is in a wheelchair due to injuries suffered in the war.  At first the Chatterley's try valiantly to keep that famous British stiff upper lip, but the devastating injury means life can never be the same for them.  Their marriage is now sexless, and there will be no children to inherit the title.  This takes a toll on their marriage, and Connie finds fulfillment in the arms of the gamekeeper.  But wait, it is completely unacceptable for a titled lady to become involved with a working class servant.  Had Connie chosen a lover of her own class, society would have turned a blind eye to it.  In fact, Sir Clifford had even suggested she should have an affair and have a child that they could raise as their own.  Even Connie's bohemian sister is shocked and disapproving of the affair with a rough laborer.

Now, I did read the book, but that was so long ago that I don't honestly remember enough to know if this production is true to the book or not.  It seems to be, to the best of my recollection.

This production is lavishly done.  The house and the scenery are beautiful.  I think at least some of the interior scenes were shot in the same house that was used in Gosford Park. At least, that staircase seems to be the same one.  Some reviewers have mentioned the terrible music.  I found out the rights for the music used when this program was broadcast were not available when the DVD was released, so other music was substituted.  It is repeated frequently, but it didn't bother me.

All the actors do a terrific job, and I felt they were all well cast.  I suppose that one could argue that Sean Bean as Mellors is more attractive than he is described in the novel, but he still fits the role.  Joely Richardson is good as Lady Chatterley, but the two characters I found most fascinating were Sir Clifford and his nurse Mrs. Bolten.  We see Clifford trying to remain cheerful, trying to have a good attitude, but he slowly sinks into bitterness.  He becomes spoiled, short tempered, and self centered.  This down turn in personality is oddly encouraged by Mrs. Bolten.  Yet, she also befriends Lady Chatterley, while on the other hand, she appears to deliberately drive a wedge between the couple.  The role of Sir Clifford is played by James Wilby, who just seems to have a blast with the role, especially in parts three and four, when Clifford has gone over the edge.

No review for this film would be complete without mention of the famous sex scenes.  Yes, there is a fair amount of nudity.  We even see Sir Clifford nude, including close-ups of bed sores on his buttocks.  (Imagine being the makeup artist with the task of creating fake bruising on an actor's behind.  Imagine being the actor.  LOL)  Also, there are quite a few sex scenes.  Here director Ken Russell does a good job of creating illusions that make you feel the sex scenes are more explicit than they really are.  The project comes across as quite sexy, but if you really stop to think about the sex scenes they aren't showing so much.  This is definitely a main stream movie, not softcore porn.

I think this DVD will appeal to the sort of people who like Masterpiece Theater, Merchant Ivory films, and British costume dramas.  This was a good purchase for me.",1242864000,5,3421,4.558292282430213
1814385,4,B00007JGCD,"This 1992 adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" is my favorite of the three adaptations I've watched [the other two being the 1981 version starring Sylvia Kristel in the lead, and the 2006 French version with Marina Hands].

For those unfamiliar with the story, the central character Lady Chatterley [played with consummate skill by Joely Richardson] is a sexually-frustrated wife to Lord Clifford Chatterley [James Wilby], a WW I paralyzed vet. Typical of upper class Brits and the landed gentry, Chatterley is concerned about providing an heir for his estate and suggests his wife takes a lover. Contrary to his expectations that Lady Chatterley will take up with a 'suitable' man, i.e. preferably titled, she goes for the well-built gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors [Sean Bean] and the pair begin a torrid affair that crosses the boundaries of class and all that is socially acceptable at the time.

The chemistry between Richardson's Lady Chatterley and Bean's Mellors is the highlight of this movie. The pair truly sizzle on-screen, and though Lawrence's novel was not merely a bodice-ripping read, but a serious attempt at portraying social themes, such as class boundaries etc, the passion is central to the main character's development. This was credibly portrayed on-screen as viewers get to see the evolution of Lady Chatterley as her burgeoning sexuality transforms her on the outside as much as it does internally, both emotionally and physically.

The sex scenes are graphic, but tastefully done. The cinematography is simply beautiful. As for the extras on the DVD, there is an interview with writer/director Ken Russell, a behind-the-scenes photo gallery, an author biography, and cast and crew filmographies. I'd rate this as my favorite screen adaptation of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" and recommend it to those who are fans of British period dramas, Brit Lit adaptations, as well as fans of romance dramas.",1240617600,2,1934,5.293159609120521

1814427,5,B00007JGCD,"On The cusp of my Lord of The Rings obsession, I've been passing the time by watching films starring the actors from Peter Jackson's Oscar winning epic trilogy. When my quest for Sean Bean films led me to watch Ronin- in English and Spanish-I broke down and bought the first movie I had seen the Boromir actor in- the 1993 BBC production of Lady Chatterley.
Sure Patriot Games and Goldeneye are great, but it was director Ken Russell's adaptation of the banned D.H. Lawrence novels that embedded Sean Bean in my brain. Sex, adultery, class divides, and naughty language sent not one, but three versions of D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover underground. When the third and most tame version was finally published in 1962, scandal and controversy erupted on both sides of the Atlantic.

I knew nothing of this history when I first saw the theatrical two hour version late at night on cable. Boy or girl, a young teen will find the soft core porn that is currently everywhere in our society. At the time, I often tuned in for Red Shoe Diaries. A few bumps and grinds, perhaps some [...], sometimes a nice story and historical location. The Marilyn Chambers movies, however, I could do without. I sought more than weak porn. I wanted a story.

Imagine my surprise when Lady Chatterley appeared. Unlike its early 20th century/World War I contemporaries Avonlea and The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Lady Chatterley stars Joely Richardson as the sexually repressed young wife of a paralyzed veteran (James Wilby) who finds love in a scandalous affair with her husband's gamekeeper (Sean Bean).
Make no mistake, there are kinky folks who will tune into the second and third parts of Lady Chatterley's four hours purely for the sex scenes. To take the series only for those visuals, is however an injustice. The miniseries format allows director Russell to take the time and set up the marriage of Lady Constance and Sir Clifford. They are both intellectuals in the upper class. Connie hails from a heady and upstanding artistic family, and Sir Clifford has a long list of noble names to live up to. The couple get on well enough, but there is already strain between them when the story opens. One might wonder how and why they married in the first place. The War? Perhaps the union was an unofficially arranged one? Already we have questions, as does Lady Chatterley. She yearns for more than serving as nurse to her often grumpy (although understandably so) husband. Sir Clifford, however, doesn't want to see his title end, and invites Connie to take a lover, in hopes of claiming an illegitimate child for his own.

At first, Constance clings to the image of a loyal wife-despite prodding from her own sister and father. She finds the ranch hand-foreman-wild-man-of-the-woods Mellors rude and fearful. Finally, after discussing the symbolism of the black horse of passion with Sir Clifford, Connie hires a nurse for her husband and sets off to explore her estate-an estate that the brutish and strong-not paralyzed-Mellors is always lurking. Inevitably, the Lady and the Gamekeeper begin a purely sexual affair. Their encounters grow to something more, and the couple seeks to find a escape from the society that divides them.

I dare say the serious opening and closing hours of Lady Chatterley are my favorites. The story's setup and resolution are indeed more important than the sex scenes, even though no sexual scene is superfluous or fluff. The reflections on the war, striking coalminers, and class debates all give weight to the story. Sir Clifford reads and becomes extremely intellectual while bound to his wheelchair, yet he sees nothing wrong with the English class divides. Connie of course disagrees with the notion that there will always be people who boss and people to boss. Mellors is a higher servant than most, yet he still must take orders from other household servants, and Sir Clifford mocks his accented speech. Constance's father and sister also find no problem with her taking a lover, but all expect it to be a man of upper standing, not a servant. Likewise, none of the lower class cared that Mellors and his wife lived separately until the affair with Lady Chatterley comes out. He becomes an outcast in his own society-a class that Clifford jokingly calls `the enemy'.

The absurdity of this class division is obvious to the viewer. The juxtaposition of the bright, big, and beautiful green Chatterley estate versus the cramped dirty, rocky mines is a smart move by Russell, as is the love scenes between Connie and Mellors. The natural wooded part of the estate is theirs, where class troubles can't reach them, and simplicity and innocence rule-unlike the cold, structured halls of the Wragby estate.
Russell and his co screenwriter Michael Haggaig also give double duty to the production's dialogue. I've not read any versions of Lawrence's books, only criticisms, but the screenwriters use the sound source materials to their advantage. Every line spoken has double and symbolic meaning. Part one ends with the first significant interaction between Mellors and Lady Chatterley. She wants a key for the hut on the property, and Mellors closes with, `If you let me know when you want it.' Sexual innuendo, the face value meaning, a little key into the lock penetration symbolism, and a hint of chastity belt referenced all in six words.

The acknowledgement of speech divides is also sharp. When Connie's sister Hilda (Hetty Baynes) finally meets Mellors, she asks him to speak `normal English'. The similar but different nature of the way they talk should keep the lovers apart, but it is a treat for the audience. Listen closely, and not just for the naughty language.
Now of Nip/Tuck fame, Joely Richardson was fairly new at the time of Lady Chatterley's release, as was future Sharpe star Sean Bean. Both give every ounce to the production, and the delivery from the actors is also perfect. The way Sean Bean says `Your Ladyship' alone shows his pent up torment. We follow Connie's perspective more, but listen closely to Mellors' speeches. He's been a lonely misunderstood soul and now he's found an emotional awakening with the one woman he shouldn't have. Likewise Joely Richardson is perfect in nearly every frame. She's so proper in the beginning, then shrinks in illness. She looks radiant and grows in beauty as her relationship with Mellors grows. The looks and unspoken movements between the two are exceptional. She bites her lips and nails when observing Mellors, and he often tilts his head or hunches away shy in her presence-as opposed to his upright towering over the permanently seated Clifford.

The chemistry between the leads is evident, yet Russell swiftly finds ways to symbolically divide them onscreen. Many of the scenes between Richardson and Bean are through fences or gates, implying one or the other is always locked out or in. Even after their relationship begins, trees or posts will cut the two shot down the middle, leaving a divided but symmetrical shot onscreen. Subtle but brilliant from Russell. These shots show how out of her element Constance is, but also how trapped Mellors is. The cinematography, acting, and dialogue all multitask, and multiple viewings of Lady Chatterley is a must if one is to catch everything.
Sir Clifford and his nurse Mrs. Bolton also develop a special relationship, parallel to Connie and Mellors, but acceptable of course. Their conversations seem more evenly matched. They play chess and the widowed nurse is more physically intimate with Sir Clifford then Connie, taking over the duties of bathing and shaving him. Her words are also accented, but Clifford never insults her about it. Wilby does a fine job as Clifford. He insults and bosses Mellors, but in fact it is Clifford who cannot function without his servants. Mellors may take orders, but he his own man, where Clifford's paralysis puts him at the mercy of everyone else-even Mellors. Wilby swiftly moves from sorrowful and intelligent to brutish and melancholy. You feel bad for Clifford when his motorized chair gets stuck, and further emotional when it is Mellors who must push the crippled husband of his lover. Sir Clifford of course insults Mellors and then we hate him again.

Perfectly matching James Wilby is Shirley Anne Field as Mrs. Bolton. She plays the widowed nurse expertly yet with a slight air of ambiguity. Her button up style and always proper air are perfect, if a little Mrs. Danover from Rebecca. She claims to be there for both the husband and wife but clearly puts together the pieces about Lady Chatterley and Mellors. When rumors begin about their affair, Russell alludes that it might have been Mrs. Bolton leading the servant talk, yet she swiftly covers for Connie and keeps Sir Clifford in the dark. Clueless as he is anyway, Clifford doesn't doubt Mrs. Bolton, nor does Lady Chatterley. It's almost as if she might have let something slip, but not out of malice. Mrs. Bolton seems to understand that Wragby Hall isn't where Connie belongs and seeks to speed her escape to Mellors. The women talk frankly about knowing true love, warmth, and tenderness from a man. Mrs. Bolton knows that is what Connie needs, and she won't get it from Sir Clifford.

Social and sexual intrigue aside, Lady Chatterley is a stunning period piece. The Wragby Hall location is breathtaking and takes on the feel of a supporting character itself. When Mellors waits on its vast steps, he's clearly out of his element. Likewise Clifford's room could seem like a dream. Incredible bed, books everywhere, the piano and the latest inventions. Connie, of course, fits neither in the uppity hall or the meager shack in the woods. Joely Richardson's costumes are so lush. Today such hats and flapper style dresses would seem ridiculous, but they looks gorgeous onscreen. The proper style, yet free spirited fabrics and layers fit the character so well, and Russell's attention to detail sets everything off. Richardson's wisps of hair and the clang of her beads set the tone for her wild ways.
Sean Bean's costume also says far more about his character than he does. So lowly valued, yet he wears a button collar and tie while he lurks the woods with a dog and a gun strapped to his back. The wearing or removing of his page boy hat also add depth to Mellors' mood and respectfulness. Even the music and props complete every scene. By no means is Lady Chatterley some B porn production. The wind up gramophones, old time radios, candelabras, and vintage cars sell every authenticity, and the score moves between modern jazz tunes and haunting classical arrangements. Russell insisted on using English compositions, and the tunes top off the flavor of the film.

But finally I must mention what I'm sure you've all been waiting for. The sex scenes in Lady Chatterley were spared nothing less than Russell's best, of course. There isn't any foreplay, fondling, or even oral sex. When Connie and Mellors finally get to it, they get to it. The initial consummation is a bit awkward for both parties. They discuss and try to resist but ultimately succumb to the sort of re-virginal experience. Lady Chatterley hasn't been with a real man in some time, and Mellors confesses his demeaning wife was the only woman he had ever been with. The dialogue is indeed necessary in the kinky scenes. If what's going on isn't clear in the visuals, the characters say what they mean, and I mean they say it!
The pre and post conversations are particularly important in two ambiguous sex scenes-one that is near rape and another that is most likely [...] sex. If you're not reeling and all giggles over those, prepare yourself for Part 3. I suspect Lady Chatterley's `For Mature Audiences Only' warning is for the full frontal nudity sequences. I don't wish to spoil it, but ladies if you go in slow motion, you will see the whole Bean.

In the end, however, Lady Chatterley isn't about the tawdry sex scenes. By part 4, sensitive types may need a box of tissues. The speeches from Connie and Mellors are so sincere, honest, and downright poetic that the audience can't help but root for the couple. Russell hold nothing back, from nasty husbands, kinky sex, and bad language so that we are raw, primed, and moved for the production's big finish. In Lady Chatterley's final fifteen minutes, you will be agonizing and cheering Connie and Mellors on to happiness. Do our fair lovers find each other at the end? I shan't tell!
The Lady Chatterley DVD is available in all regional formats at a very affordable price. Usually under $30 at most retailers, or online if you're a bit shy about the purchase. The double disc set has little special features to speak of, only a brief photo gallery, trailers, and an interview with Ken Russell. Not for children of course, I also don't think men will enjoy Lady Chatterley. Despite plenty of Joely's bits, males won't be interested in the story or period costume drama. Keep Lady Chatterley for your own guilty pleasure, or for that all girls night you've been planning. All four hours in one sitting, tears, and repeat viewings- I assure you Lady Chatterley will not disappoint.",1229299200,10,13172,4.891674127126231
1814428,2,B00007JGCD,"I was really dissapointed with this film. I am crazy for any adaptation of a British Lit Classic, and have a very large collection of those types of movies. Very rarely do I find one that I just don't like.  This one is that rare film.  I tried to watch it twice, and I just cannot get into it. The music is so dull and repetitive that it could put you to sleep. It's like who ever wrote the score completed two minutes worth then gave up and just decided to replay it over and over again because they were already bored of it. It is really annoying. Furthermore the acting is nothing to write home about, either very stiff or complete overkill.  I don't even think the costumes are that good, which is pretty surprising.  I do not know the novel, so I am not sure how the characters are supposed to be, but in this film they are irritating. It is hard to sit through hours of a film when you don't like the main characters. If Lady Chatterly were your friend you would tell her not to get involved with that creep and stop whining. I had no sympathy for her. Her lover is nasty. He does not seem to even like her and then POOF! they are in love and running naked through the woods together. The only one you have any sympathy for is Lady Chatterly's husband, and his character is pretty annoying too.  The actor who plays him WAY overdoes it.  He is played like a farce.  The crazy war veteran who hears gunfire and is still commanding his troops, wearing his old uniform. He is a ridiculous stereotype that would be more at home in a comedy. The only part I remotely enjoyed was when Lady Chatterly goes to visit her eccentric and entertaining family by the sea.  At least the scenery is pretty. Unfortunately you will probably fall asleep or shut it off before you get to that point. It is as if the filmakers felt that they could get by with this one simply with the sex. But that is not enough.  This is not aimed at a porn audience, this is supposed to be aimed at an audience interested in a literary classic-- literature that is not purchased at the adult book store! If all you want to see is some bad sex scenes, full frontal nudity, and a lot of moaning and groaning, cut the crap and buy some porn!",1193788800,,2210,4.2304038004750595
1814429,3,B00007JGCD,"If I did not know this was Ken Russel's work, I would mistake it for a run-of the-mill BBC mini series.  OK, but not exciting.  There is no chemistry between the lady and her lover.  Sir Clifford (the husband) is more likeable than Mellors (the lover) -- that should tell you something.  Russel's work falls especially flat after seeing a superb new French version of Lady Chatterley by Pascale Ferran.  For me, Ferran's is the ultimate interpretation of D.H.

1814430,1,B00007JGCD,"While this adaptation did draw many good points from the story it was based on, it was very nearly ruined by poor acting. There just wasn't much chemistry between the two main characters, and many of the other characters seemed flat. Lady Chatterly herself ended up seeming somewhat frigid, which is certainly not what you would expect from an adulteress.
The format of a miniseries can be a good choice when there is a great deal of content to be conveyed, but this one just seemed to drag on and on. What should have been an enjoyable and thought provolking romp popping with chemistry and passion was turned into seemingly endless tedium. The one bright spot in the whole film was the scene where the two run through the meadow in the rain. For the first time, the viewer begins to glimpse some tenderness and joy, but it is quickly dashed, as that is the last romantic scene in the whole movie.
Good luck sitting through it. If you really want to experience this story as it should be, but without reading it, I suggest buying the audiobook.",1183680000,2,1045,4.5638297872340425

1814433,5,B00007JGCD,"This BBC miniseries has a well earned reputation as being much looser and freer with its literary souce (here the source material is not just one work but several works of DH Lawrence)than most literary adaptations for English television. Also, while most BBC productions of literary masterpieces are studies in social conservatism this one obviously identifies with and invites us to identify with its most irreverent and forward-thinking characters: in this case the sultry and sophisticated, and somewhat libertine (in a 1920's kind of way), Lady Chatterly & the earthy and irreverent and smoldering (smoldering both with class resentment and with lust for a lady from the oppressive class) Oliver Mellors.  Both of these factors can be attributed to director Ken Russell who has had a long and illustrious career writing and directing some of the BBC's best programs (many of them about musical composers). Russell is nothing if not unconventional and freethinking. Of course most of us in the states know Ken Russell as the director of a handful of cult classics such as TOMMY (1975), ALTERED STATES (1979),and, GOTHIC (1986); all of which feature lurid dream sequences and, some would say, gratuitously lewd situations. But Ken Russell is actually a director with many facets, and Russell's interest in DH Lawrence goes back to at least 1969 when he made what is still the best DH Lawrence adaptation on film, WOMEN IN LOVE (starring Glenda Jackson, Oliver Reed & Alan Bates). He then followed that up twenties years later with THE RAINBOW (starring Amanda Donohoe, and Sammie Davis). Both of these adaptations are known for being restrained and fairly true to their sources even though Russell did add some scenes in both which were not in the original books; his additions, however, were tasteful and even added clarity to the material.

What is interesting about this new DH Lawrence adaptation is that Ken Russell seems to have remained interested in DH Lawrence for so many years and for many of the same reasons. DH Lawrence more than any other author in the English language, or any language for that matter, stands for the power of the body and the bodies experience over the power of reason. This was the main theme of his earlier DH Lawrence adaptations and this is the main theme of his latest. But this one is by far the most sensual of the three and that is largely due to the fact that Joely Richardson seems to be the very embodiment of sensual awakening; the actress seems as willing as her character to simply follow the dictates of the body regardless of social norms.  Its always a big deal when a high profile actress (especially one with the lineage of Joely Richardson) sheds her clothes on screen, but to do so on British televison for all to see takes more than a little boldness. The nudity is well done and adds to the allure of this BBC classic; no question about that. The greatest scene in the entire 4 hour miniseries is not the nudity, however, but, the vision Joely has before she ever ventures out to that hut in the woods. One night after hearing her blowhard husband, Lord Clifford  (who cares more for his family estate ""Wragby"" and his ""class"" than he does about any individual), read from Socrates about the white horse of reason and the black horse of desire, she dreams she is riding through a Greek temple full of nude men who seem to be growing like vines out of the stone. This is not something that DH Lawrence ever wrote, this is pure Ken Russell and yet its the most exciting thing in the whole miniseries; plus its the best way to deliver Lady Chatterly's state of mind (or body) to us. DH Lawrence is actually very wordy for one who claims to be interested in the body more than in the mind but Ken Russell has found a visual shorthand for delivering those Lawrentian themes with nice visuals. I only wish there were more moments like this. The most sensual acting is done by Joely Richarson when in her private chambers. And Russell seems to be keenly aware that it is Lady Chatterly's imagination that fires her body. After the horse dream Connie drapes a veil over her head and walks nude through the house down to Lord Clifford's first-floor room. This scene is more imaginatively and erotically charged than any of the actual love scenes that will follow.

The actual affair between Lady Chatterly and Oliver Mellors is a little odd; in fact its very awkward. At first they just agree (sort of) to use each other for sex. But of course that never works and soon they are intimates thoroughly engaged with each other, body and mind, and running naked through the rainy glades and meadows; then sitting nake dbefore a fire and pretending to be Lady Jane and John Thomas. Their ""understanding"" involves a mutual appreciation of nature, and a mutual loathing of Lord Clifford and the upper-class privileges that he defends as birthrights. Russell gets a lot of mileage out of the Racine and Proust reading and piano and chess playing Lord Clifford and his antagonisms toward all those that he perceives to be lower than himself (pretty much everyone in the coal mining community that he owns; this actor really has fun with this role and Russell obviously enjoys his rants because he gives him so many). Lord Clifford is actually a pretty forward-thinking guy, in his own way, as he does give his wife permission to take a lover, but, arguably, its for selfish reasons: he merely wants an heir. We certainly pity this WWI vet who must cart himself around in various malfunctioning contraptions (metaphors for the mind and its futile tinkerings perhaps; what people are reduced to when they no longer have a functioning body) but he just won't allow anyone to actually like him except his live-in nurse who finds him curiously attractive (a plot thread that Russell leaves undeveloped). He even vents about the lower classes ""knowing their place"" in the ""natural"" scheme of things right in front of his house servants. Russell lingers on the face of one table servant as he does so (another striking Russell touch). No mistaking whose side this film maker is on. So this affair of the body between Lady Chatterly and Mellors is actually informed by a social awareness and a mutual understanding and empathy (which one could argue is as much about reason as it is about the body). In any event we eventually come to accept that these two opposties are drawn to one another for a variety of social and sexual reasons: the one perhaps fueling the other.

Lady Chatterly's own father and sister are free-living  bohemians; so why exactly she was attracted to the repressed snob Lord Clifford Chatterly is a bit of a mystery. Both her father and sister encourage Connie to find lovers but her sister anyway is as much as a snob as Lord Clifford. We're not certain and we never hear what her father thinks of her affair with the gamekeeper Mellors so we never know if the affair has had social repercussions for Lady Chatterly herself.

The ending is a bit ...well I don't want to give it away. Suffice it to say that it's different than the book and it doesn't quite resolve those class issues that it raised. The answer seems to be: leave England. Perhaps the ending is based on one of Lawrence's short stories. In any event Ken Russell's creative attitude toward the ""classics"" is perhaps the most attractive thing about this adaptation. I hope his attitude is contagious and will inspire more loose and free treatments of the classics. This cultural freedom is refreshing and liberating (for mind and body).",1153699200,46,7559,4.751713632901752
1814434,4,B00007JGCD,"For anyone who has seen the 1981 film adaptation by Just Jaeckin and was dissapointed then this is for you. The 1981 film, I feel, failed to capture the essence of Lady Chatterley's character whilst this version has got it almost perfect. I think the filming and editing in this version far exceeds the film and the acting is a darn sight better. Joely Richardson does the lead justice and Sean Bean (although much better looking that the book describes Mellors but really, who's complaining?) compliments her well. The screen play is faithful considering filming constraints and all together I really enjoyed it. I'm now studying the novel for a university module and this has made me appreciate what is essentially a book/adaptation that pushes class boundaries through the guise of female sexuality. It caused a lot of controversy because of the female lead apparantly being stronger than her husband, taken to extreme in her sexual escapades, rather than being simply an object owned my him. At the trial of the book in the late 1920s the procecutor famously opened with the statement ""Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?"" Need he say more?
