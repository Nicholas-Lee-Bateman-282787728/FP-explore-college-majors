I think I love it so much because the town of Rosebud and its inhabitants that are featured in the story remind me very much of the small town that I moved to.  It's just a lighthearted, hilarious film. Nevermind it was made in the late 80's, the jokes are still great for a laugh!",1514160000,,333,4.1875

8620985,5,B00G5S86U2,"I only buy things I love and this is one of my top ten comedies. To be really picky, which I'm never, I would have made a couple of very minor changes to the cast and script but, overall, this is one I will watch many times; especially when I need a ' pick me up'. All Chevy's movies are incredible entertainment, which the world used to have in abundance, but sadly lacks as each year passes.",1465776000,3,393,4.116883116883117
