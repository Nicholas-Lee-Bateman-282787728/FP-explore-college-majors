8182841,5,6304132964,"The Broncos need to return to their old uniforms. They have the absolute worst uniforms in the league. When they lose, no one loses uglier than them. It's embarrasing how bad these damn uniforms are. When you put the 1965-66 jerseys that they wore in the 1994 75th Anniversary season with the classic helmet worn from 1968 - 1996 you have the best uniform in football. And they should always be wearing the orange pants on the road. That was a great road uniform. It's like Bowlen doesn't give a darn about Broncos tradition. And even Shanahan had some negative things to say about the uniform when the Broncos beat the Cowboys on Thanksgiving a few years back. And the new Mile High is a joke compared to MILE HIGH STADIUM. Invesco is a corporate building. Mile High was a football stadium. That's another subject.

What do you think about the Broncos returning to their old uniforms like the Jets and Giants? Teams like the Steelers (even though they switch to those weak looking soccer style numbers instead of the old block numbers) Redskins, Raiders have kept their great classic uniforms. Some owners understand uniform tradition while the Bowlens and Krafts spit on it.

  I really want the Broncos to return to their traditional uniforms. No one loses any uglier than Denver. I mean that literally and figuratively. Can we start a petition collectively?,(i.e the fans and writers)

I would like to see the Broncos take the field with the following uniforms:

1 - The Lou Saban D logo helmet worn from 1968-1996

2 - The Home Jersey worn in 1965 and again in 1994 commemorating the NFL 75th

3 - The Road Jersey worn in 1965 and again in 1994

4- The 1971 Orange Pants worn like back then, on the road. I can still see the old NFL Films footage with Tombstone Jackson, Lyle Alzado and Floyd Little wearing these old classics. Look at some of the tradition minded teams getting back or simply maintaining their classic uniforms. The Bills, Jets, Giants, Steelers, Chiefs and even the Raiders.",1316649600,,1998,4.685714285714286
