8236292,3,B000ZQ4RQ2,"Baker's movie career had a second life overseas in the '70s and here was a particularly *hot* example of her under-appreciated acting talent and incredible sensuality in a sometimes poignant, sometimes tragic setting: she's a '70s lady of leisure, married to a very successful Industrialist, who's also burned out psychologically...and otherwise.
His Psychologist is also a friend who has no problem advising him that some controlled promiscuity might help. Real period stuff. So he suddenly feels liberated and engages some other lost souls in his self-rescue mission.
Baker is just as frustrated but is very moral and still patient enough to wait for her husband's rejuvenation - to a point. Her feelings boil over while she is vacationing with her stepson, a handsome, young dude who has *his* act together.
Some exciting scenes throughout the movie, though it's dubbed in English, and so is Carroll Baker's voice! The voice-over is fine but what a shame to miss out that voice of liquid gold.",1233360000,5,996,5.116564417177914
