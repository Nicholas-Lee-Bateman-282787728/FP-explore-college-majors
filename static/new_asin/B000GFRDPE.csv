8131544,5,B000GFRDPE,This is the first Tex Ritter movie I watched and I loved it.,1456790400,,60,3.6923076923076925
8131545,3,B000GFRDPE,"According to the case cover of this DVD, the films are ""Digitally Restored.""  If that's true, then the term means nothing whatsoever.  There are splotches, blanks, dropouts, lost dialogue, lost lyrics in the songs, at the most important points, or so it seems as one watches.

As for the films themselves, well, Tex Ritter was no great shakes as an actor.  His hair was always combed and his clothes were always neat, even in fight scenes and even after he'd ridden hard after the bad guys.  But this was the fashion of the 1930s.  Roy Rogers and Gene Autry didn't get mussed either.  No, the films are fun for the sake of nostalgia alone.  There are much, much better western movies, but there was something about Tex, especially when he broke into song, that is very satisfying.

And he sure as heck deserved a better presentation than this ""digital restorer"" gave him.  I give this 5 stars for Tex and the appearance of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys western swing group; 0 for the restoration.",1183161600,2,999,4.625
