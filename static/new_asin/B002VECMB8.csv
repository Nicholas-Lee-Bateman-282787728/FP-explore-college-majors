3994531,5,B002VECMB8,"As someone who has both laid off staff and a year later, became the victim of a layoff after twelve years with the same company, I had a personal interest in seeing how director/co-screenwriter Jason Reitman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thank-You-for-Smoking/dp/B000H0MKOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thank You for Smoking</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno/dp/B0014CQNTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno</a>) was going to adapt Walter Kirn's smart, unsettling 2001 novel. Even though eight years have elapsed since the book's publication, the filmmaker - along with co-writer Sheldon Turner - manages to deepen Kirn's themes in this wry, emotionally resonant 2009 dramedy and make them even more relevant with the pervasive downsizing of corporate America. The movie also manages to surprise even when certain plot turns seem evident before they occur. Initially, there is a veneer of cynicism that makes you think the story will be an abject lesson in the impermanence of life, but instead, it evolves into one man's journey into the heart of the emotional turbulence he had been careful to avoid. Toward that end, Reitman seems to be inspired by Alexander Payne's equally perceptive road movies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/About-Schmidt/dp/B00005JLSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">About Schmidt</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sideways/dp/B0007TKOAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sideways</a>, films that reflect a similar storytelling style.

The plot focuses on laser-sharp corporate layoff consultant Ryan Bingham, a man who regales in the impermanence of life by traveling 322 days on the road, informing targeted employees that they are about to lose their jobs. There is a necessary callousness in his approach, but he knows it's necessary to be present and honest when it comes to conveying the unpleasant news. Bingham is also a motivational speaker who espouses unburdening one's life of possessions and fitting everything essential within the confines of a backpack. Proving his case, he lives in hotels, airplanes, and airport terminals with his one life goal being the seventh person to collect ten million frequent-flier miles. If you can get past the Spartan one-bedroom apartment he keeps in Omaha for the 43 days he is forced to be at home, the hatchet man appears to lead a charmed if rather solitary life. Complications, however, ensue on both personal and professional fronts.

Bingham meets a fellow transient traveler named Alex Goran in an airport lounge and assesses that he may have found his soul-mate, so much so that he invites her to come to his estranged sister's wedding in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Bingham's boss wants to introduce a new strategy proposed by a fresh-faced, post-grad school upstart. New hire Natalie Keener suggests using remote teleconferencing to perform the layoff notifications. Since the new technology is the antithesis of Bingham's one-on-one method, he brings Natalie along on the road to show her how it can't possibly work. In a role that feels custom-tailored to all his strengths, George Clooney plays Bingham with an emotional precision that complements his charismatic persona which pivots between swaggering and self-effacing. On one hand, it's his most definitive movie-star role, and yet Clooney has never revealed as much about himself onscreen.

The always watchable Vera Farmiga (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000M341QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Down-to-the-Bone/dp/B000I0QL7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Down to the Bone</a>) is sexy and confident as the woman who seems perfect for Bingham, even though their adroit compatibility could not possibly sustain an actual commitment. Their interplay is fun to watch because there is a Cary Grant-Rosalind Russell-level rapport that keeps both on their toes. Anna Kendrick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001P5HRMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>) is winning as Natalie even if her character's naivet feels a bit manufactured at times. Jason Bateman has a field day playing Bingham's smarmy boss, while Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey, and Danny McBride (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pineapple-Express/dp/B001J9KJ4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pineapple Express</a>) plays their accustomed types with aplomb as members of Bingham's immediate family. In cameos, J.K. Simmons (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno/dp/B000YABYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno</a>) and Zach Galifianakis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B001UV4XEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>) sharply play two of the victimized employees, but for the rest, Reitman uses non-actors replaying their recent experiences of getting laid off. As usual with Reitman's films, it boasts an eclectic soundtrack that works really well with the storyline.",1261267200,142,5252,6.966616084977238
3994532,4,B002VECMB8,"Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) has found what he thinks is the perfect way of life. He is able to travel the country giving the bad news to people that have been ""downsized"" by their corporations. This way he can rack up the miles, stay at high end hotels and avoid any of those messy emotional attachments that tie other people down.

But he gets thrown for a loop when his own company decides to replaces travel with video conferencing. A new employee named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) is the one who came up with this cost cutting measure. Ryan is, of course, furious with her. But is still given the task of showing her the ropes while the new system is being tested. The ""old dog vs bright young thing"" dynamic is very much in place and creates some smart and funny moments.

But the movie kicks into high gear after Ryan begins developing feelings for a fellow frequent flier named Alex (Vera Farmiga). These two have real chemistry and Ryan is forced to question if his free and easy lifestyle is really what he wants.

Clooney is silky smooth as the travelling businessman who thinks he has it made. It's almost a given he will receive an Oscar nomination for this role and, if so, it will be well deserved. Vera Farmiga is also excellent as a woman looking for a little committment free fun herself.

But what I liked most about this movie is it's ""old school"" charm that relies on character development and well written dialogue rather than crude jokes or flashy special effects. There are a few scenes that didn't work for me. But still it's nice to enjoy a movie written for mature adults rather than hormone crazed teens, there are still a few of us grown up types that go to the cinema after all.

It's not my favorite film of the year. But it is still pretty darn good. Look for this one to rack up the awards on Oscar night.",1261180800,,1835,4.433234421364985
3994533,5,B002VECMB8,"Before I was completely numb by the experience, I was afraid of commercial airplanes.  Totally drowning in tears whenever I was provoked to ride one, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-movies/dp/0780631684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the movies</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-d-seen/dp/B000065V40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'd seen</a>&nbsp;only exacerbated my phobia.  But there are the opposites who are thrilled by the flights, those that can't help but rest in the seats/flotation devices and sink in to the turbulence as they reach their rendezvous in high speeds, living life in the high plane.  For people like Ryan Bingham, travel by flight is THE way of life.  His job has him travel across city by city, doing his business without concern of human interaction while adjusted to the familiar scenery of airports and hotels, carrying light all the way.  Soon, he'll find out his 'bag' is starting to feel a bit heavier.

Director Jason Reitman is acclaimed as a promising new director, even moreso for his films than his father's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/current/dp/0783230370/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">current</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/slumps/dp/B000J4QW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">slumps</a>, though I had took the notion with a grain of salt.  ""Thank You For Smoking"" I liked, but ""Juno"" I did not, at least not after the first viewing; I gave ""Juno"" some approval out of modesty because of the particular indie angle, but I wasn't into it as every home skillet who has and I grew less interested in it after a few watches.  ""Up in the Air"", however, never gave me that feeling; I am warmly and unpretentiously embracing it.  Come to think of it, ""Up in the Air"" goes back to certain elements relating to Reitman's first film: having a suave protagonist who makes the job about ruining people's lives look easy, a cunning love interest that provokes promiscuity, the glow of social commentary, and quick d-bag verbalization.  The film also carries a few redeeming values of that Diablo Cody feature like human companionship and coping with unwanted expectations.  Somehow Jason Reitman manage to make this film blend the good parts of ""Smoking"" with the good parts of ""Juno"", and become a truly magnificent comedy-drama.

""Up in the Air"" is about Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney, a professional who makes a living firing people across cities by plane because, as he stated, 'the bosses were too much of a p**** to do it themselves' (already the humor's kicking in).  Back in his working place, he's greeted with a young new employee who she provided a less-costly alternative to layoff people: using webcams.  Not only did she made firing the workers even more heartless than it already is, but she made flight travel unnecessary, which Bingham didn't accept.  The quirky but very calculating new employee teamed up with confrontational Bingham so she can learn the tools of the trade, following his direct method and eventually understanding how cruel the job really is.  Bingham also met Vera Farmiga's character who's a genderswap version of himself, forming an intimate bond that, for him, became something more.

First things first, this is hilarious!  Reitman delivered an incredible sharp wit that actually made me laugh; most witty movies tried to be too clever and lose their humorous luster, but this is one of the rare witty movies I've seen that's smart and accessible.  It's the way the characters say their lines with such punchiness and how they responded 'positively' to troubled situations with such irony that made the humor excellent, such as the scene where Bingham explained why getting involved is unneeded to someone who's just been rejected.  Laughs aren't always the focus, there are moments where the cast try to endear themselves with their responsibilities and opportunities.  The cast are all good, but George Clooney's role knocked it out of the sky.  I can't hate Clooney, I can envy him but it's hard to spite him because he's got that charismatic Cary Grant-attitude going on and he showed it here.  His character is level-headed when he's on the job, but he can also have fun and let loose; at times during circumstances, he can be very sweet to others.

The film isn't just about a self-efficient job-killer having a change of heart after encountering a few people and in regards to his sister's wedding plan, it's about downsizing.  Besides actors like J.K. Simmons and The Hangover guy playing the parts, there's actual unemployed business workers being used during the firing scenes.  They add some degree of authenticity for these troubled moments, and their responses (whether they're verbatim or improv) range from amusing to depressing.  It's mostly amusing, but at times a few of them can be pretty grim, especially the one that's threatening to jump over a bridge; that one I'm not sure if that's an actor or not, but the response was so mute and to-the-point that it's haunting.  I'm reminded how bad job losses can affect people, and for others like Jason Bateman as Bingham's boss, the companies' losses are their gain.

I learned a lot from ""Up in the Air"", such as how to efficiently pack to go places, knowing the workings of Bingham's profession, the benefits of travel, and pigeonholing people properly; it's all done in a humorous light, but that doesn't make the film any less thought-provoking.  It kept me enthralled from beginning to the bittersweet end, and boy, was it mundane.  I knew about its certain turnaround and it still left me feeling bad.  From that point on showed Clooney's best performance, because he kept it all inside; he presents despair without actually expressing it, a true testament of acting.  A lot of things have been talked about in this movie, but it's what it showed that meant something, for Bingham to experience the joy of others and to realize the inescapable reality of his way of life.

If these parts don't piece together one of the best films of 2009, I don't what is.  At the very least, it's the second good film with the word ""Up"" in the title.",1261008000,,6263,5.311043566362716
3994534,3,B002VECMB8,"George Clooney plays the suave role here reminiscent (a bit) of his part in Michael Clayton. He looks more and more like Clark Gable in each movie.
His character Ryan travels from city to city, a glib corporate axe-man, signing on to fire staff at various companies when the in-house booses lack the guts to fire staff themselves. He prides himself on his coldness, his lack of attachments, no house, no wife, no friends nothing but a zillion American Airlines sky miles. He ""up in the air"" in the cold and clouds. He shows up, tells people they are fired, repeating the same routine about how this is their big chance to do what they always wanted, etc, etc. He meets a woman, Alex played by Vera Farmiga, who also lives in the air, more or less. ""Think of me as just like you, but with a v[female parts]"", she says.

The ""fire-ees""? ""terminateds""? in this movie are NOT actors, the director went for real people who had recently been fired and acted them to say, in their words, what then said when they were really axed. They lend gravitas. Clooney works for a company that specializes in this. The company decide to hire a new young woman, played by Anna Kendrick, who want to cut expenses (there is a Recession, after all...) by axing employees over the internet instead of in person.

The movie is very slick, very well acted and directed. Very believeable. Very soulless.

By the things change (I won't reveal the plot) and we are supposed to feel sorry for Clooney at the end, but it didn't work that way with me. It is supposed to be ironic and funny in places. It is funny in places, but I just felt really, really sad and sorry for all those people getting fired whose lives were being destroyed...",1260921600,5,1709,4.488745980707395

3994562,5,B002VECMB8,"There's an emotional depth to this movie which some reviewers apparently missed.  Most of it is conveyed non-verbally, through people's expressions, and if you can read those, you'll get a lot out of the movie.  Yes, George Clooney plays a man who goes around fireing people and is living a life in limbo: ""Up in the Air.""  At first he seems to be pretty heartless and unemotional but as the story progresses we see he's really a lot more empathetic and caring, and a lot more injured, than he appears at first glance.

Sure, there's a romantic relationship at the center but the focus isn't the relationship as much as what it does to Clooney's character. It makes him grow. It makes him realize that relationships matter, that having people in your life is a good thing.

Great movie for anyone who wants to be reminded that freedom from attachments isn't true freedom, that happiness comes from shared experiences and love. And no, it's not too cheesy or a chick film. It doesn't end perfectly but still isn't a tragedy. There's a nice balance.

Great movie, dark, real and depressing.  There are plenty of happy moments in this movie though, the movie did not end on a high note but is that a bad thing?  I just recently heard of this movie from listening to Anna Kendrick's book and was surprised that two of my favorite actors(Clooney and Kendrick) were in a movie together and I did not know it.  I see a lot of reviews about how the movie ended in a depressing way.  In my opinion that means the movie did its job, aren't we suppose to feel something after watching a movie?

3994762,3,B002VECMB8,"I was very interested in reading the reviews here before I saw this movie. I think, and this is supposition. That many folks here really didn't understand, or have gone through the ordeal of being let go. No one likes it. No one is ready for it. I like the idea that I get to see from the other side of the desk the person telling the bad news so to speak.

Don't take too much inside about the this movie, and I think it does well. George Clooney frankly is on Automatic Pilot so to speak. He could do this role in his sleep. I have seen him in many other movies that are far more exciting than this one. This one again proves his dynamic range as an actor. A wonderful thing.

The writing of this is a bit half baked, and is not any award winning material. But for what is does accomplish, a look into that curious part of your employ you hope you never experience. I like the interplay with the characters, though it is a bit shallow for my taste. Your mileage may vary. I cannot say too much without giving away too much. There are some inaccuracies. Hollywood seems to be great at that, but it doesn't hurt the presentation too much unless you happen to catch it, and it bothers you.

I like and identify with the travel, and the adventure that goes with it, and its purpose. I used to do allot of that myself as well.

I think the takeaway here is that there is stresses, and baggage no pun intended here, that we all carry to some extent. It defines who we are for better or worse. I think for George here, and the other characters it fits well. Jason Bateman through me for a loop in his performance. I didn't even pay attention that this was who he was. Good acting? I don't know.

If you take this movie for what it is, and don't ask too much of it, it will entertain. So basically don't look for first class performance in an economy motion picture, and all is good.",1482364800,3,1877,4.1740331491712706

Professional production details, slick and commercially viable, fast-moving script, but it's hard to find a lead character you really like.  It seems to share the chronic modern Hollywood problem, that of a smug soullessness defeating the filmmaker's quest for smartness.  If you can't get enough of Clooney in his professional role, the part of his life where he does something other than preach partisan politics, this will give you enough of his gorgeousness and sparkle to last a few days after viewing.",1481328000,,644,4.944444444444445

3994959,4,B002VECMB8,"This movie starts out with scenes that make you expect a slick, slightly shallow, but enjoyable film.  The choreographed suitcase snapping, card sliding, line skipping, and smug business travel scenes are captivating.  George Clooney plays the handsome, sharp dressed, confident, aloof-yet-somehow-charming, professional job terminator.  (Sigh.  George Clooney was so enjoyable to watch.) After a few scenes, he meets Alex (Vera Farminga), a sensual, elegant and smug female traveler, as well as co-worker Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a young know-it-all whose business ideas will threaten his way of life.  At this point I predicted the entire plot and then settled back expecting to watch a glossy, polished film. I was wrong. The characters began to develop.  New plot twists emerged.  Realistic scenes of people being fired felt sobering and raw. By the end of the movie, all my plot predictions had somehow managed to happen as well as to not happen by veering off course in new and unexpected directions.  I think what I liked best about this movie (besides watching George Clooney) is that while it started out slick, it ended with reality.  It doesn't have any answers and after watching this, you may not either.  But likely you will find yourself thinking about all the scenes and characters of the movie and wondering about them long after the movie has ended.",1480896000,,1367,5.144796380090498

3995126,5,B002VECMB8,"Five ENJOYABLE Stars! The dramedy ""Up In The Air"" is based on the novel by author Walter Kirn and has its plot built around a gruesome task. George Clooney stars as the protagonist who is a 'hired gun' in the business world, politely firing people for companies who don't want to do it themselves. And he's great at it, efficiently removing people from the rolls while racking up the air miles, rental car points, and other amenities in his solitary life, as he crisscrosses the country.  But unexpected changes are in the wind for him from 2 characters, excellently played by Vera Farmiga, who received a Best Supporting Actress-Academy Award nomination, and Anna Kendrick, plus a bothersome family wedding, as his life becomes challenging. Also starring Jason Bateman, Amy Morton, and Melanie Lynskey with J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis, and Sam Elliott in excellent cameos. Directed by Jason Reitman. Highly Recommended. Five FATEFUL Stars. (Paramount pictures. Rated R with a very brief nudity scene. CC. Time-2 hours. Showtime viewing.)",1459123200,,1042,5.2023809523809526

Human Resource drones no longer stand between the employee and management. They are the weapons employed to justify wage freezes, suspensions, and firings.

I liked the way the storyline addressed the fraudulent use of feel good words to hide the truth. It also exposes the shallowness of human relations including the family level. Narcism rules until the characters world evaporates, exposing an emptiness they never were cognizant of.

Those who have experienced multiple episodes know exactly what I mean. Those who haven't are represented by the 1 and 2 star reviewers who will never get it unless it happens to them.",1458259200,,761,5.2809917355371905

3995142,5,B002VECMB8,"Up In The Air is a comedy/drama film that stars George Clooney,Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick. It is a story about a corporate ""downsizer"" Ryan Bingham and his travels. The film follows his isolated life and philosophies along with the people he meets along the way. It was directed by Jason Reitman and co-written by Reitman and Sheldon Turner based on the novel of the title that was written by Walter Kirn.

Ryan Bingham (Clooney)makes his living personally handing out pink slips -- he's the top hatchet man at a company that other companies hire when they are downsizing. And since business is booming, his job keeps him on the go constantly. He flies all across the country, staying in a series of nice hotels. And although this itinerant lifestyle prevents him from having any kind of stable, regular life, this doesn't bother him in the slightest -- he's thrilled to be a boy in a traveling bubble. During one particular layover, he strikes up a conversation with Alex Goran (Farmiga), a fellow savvy traveler. They bond over the ins and outs of various airlines and hotels, and quickly fall into bed. By morning, they are figuring out when their schedules will allow them to meet up again, even though they both make it clear that there are no strings attached. When Ryan arrives back in the home office, he meets no-nonsense career- oriented twenty-something Natalie Keener (Kendrick), a fast-rising up- and-comer who wants to change the company's practices and save millions by having the staff fire people remotely via web cams. Furious at the thought of losing a lifestyle he's grown quite comfortable with, he convinces his boss to let him take Natalie on a few trips so that she can learn what it's really like to fire someone.

George Clooney is thoroughly likable as the amusingly callous Ray. Watching him at the heart-breaking job of terminating folk is fun and gives the film its heart. The other women - Farmiga and Kendrick - also provide memorable performances.

What makes it a wonderful film is the fact that it succeeds because it doesn't take itself that seriously and it shows a moment of fundamental change in a man's life that every viewer could probably relate to as he/she have lost a job which happens to be a common thing especially with the United States experiencing an economic downturn.

Overall,the movie delivers and a classic in the making.",1451174400,,2381,4.828431372549019
3995143,2,B002VECMB8,"No, thanks.

The only George Clooney role I've enjoyed watching is Danny Ocean.  This is a far cry from there.

Good visuals in the opening title sequence.  That was the real high point. All the sticking up for my generation of women mumbo-jumbo that Natalie insisted on saying was dreary.  Kind of fun to watch two people compare travel status programs... Kind of fun when Sam Elliott shows up.

Not much in the middle worth watching. Entirely predictable plot twist, unlikable characters.",1449100800,,490,4.914634146341464

 The best scenes are the sad ones, when Natalie has to fire a middle aged man in a teleconference. Or when Ryan is having a very sad conversation on an airport train and trying to contain his emotions in public. Rent the film for Clooney and Kendrick, they make it more than worth your three bucks.

Without giving up the plot, the big twist was a bit of a shock and with it...Clooney's character strikes off in a new direction.  I don't think this is an edge of your seat mystery, just a sweet romantic movie.  Ha, well romance and Clooney are a wonderful way to spend an evening.

3995297,5,B002VECMB8,"Clooney is Clooney.  ""Five words - randomly selected for Additional screening.""

Anna Kendrick in her break-out role is great (the youthful intensity is well done).  ""I type with purpose"".  ""I wanted to call them Terminators, but it bumped with legal.""

But the one who stole the scenes to me was Vera Farmiga ""Just think of me as yourself, only with a vagina.""  She provides the sexual tension and proves you don't have to be the traditional super-model to be HOT.

Small roles for Justine Bateman and J.K. Simmons, who both provide great characters in a few words, round out a great cast.

The script takes on one of the worst possible topics (face it - not a lot of Human Resources mega-hits out there) but shows the ability to see the multiple perspectives and add humor in doses.  It's not a side-splitting romp or an action thriller.  But if you like to get invested in truly complex characters, there's plenty here, even though the primary cast is only three people.

The script is full of one-liners that are typically laden with sarcasm or dry humor, but if you are into that, it works.  The actors were wonderfully cast to provide the right timing and delivery.  The dialog is witty, serious, and yet paces the film.  Think Aaron Sorkin at half the speed.  Sorkin fans will understand...

The end of the movie is provocative.  You feel so sorry for Clooney's character, Ryan Bingham, but his voice-over at the end seems to say he's ""back where he belongs"" and feels most comfortable.  If true, then it really becomes a happy ending.

Look, it's like Woody Allen movies (which I personally can't stand).  This will likely be a movie you love as I did, or you will hate it with the flaming passion of a thousand red hot suns.  But you likely won't just say, ""Meh...""",1443139200,,1774,4.603833865814696

Nostalgic romantic comedies or tragedies like the Money Pit or War of the Roses are more about the essential Battle of the Sexes given a new twist of Women's Lib and movies like Hoffman's role of transvestite in Tootsie.  Having gone 3/4 circle is Hollyweird trying to show itself off as favoring marriage and love???  No this film is a cynics' eye view of both in the character of Clooney as the anti-hero stooge for Corporate lack of heart and soul.  Is it accurate ~ Ask anyone who worked for GE in the 70'd and beyond!  This movie forms a very strong argument for divestiture of the Corp State run conglomerate and a complete revolution in the marketplace for the sake of families and future generations.",1443052800,,906,4.533742331288344

One reviewer said it looks at relationships from many perspectives rather than the old standard of marriage, etc. etc. makes you happy, but then the guy ends up wanting that very thing and losing it. Reaching his goal leaves him somewhat empty. The movie about this guy's confusion, but doesn't really do anything in the end but confirm that he was right to keep his backpack empty, except at the end I felt like he was depressed to find out he was right to do so. The best I can say for this movie is that I might have learned a thing or two about making flying easier or that George Clooney is handsome, but we knew that too.

Umm. I guess there is a point to this movie about superficial, shallow people needing to settle down by getting a life with people in it. But who knows? Seems like George Clooney movies are more about building this fake image of him as some super human cool dude that the rest of us are supposed to be in awe of and want to be like. So in perpetuating this myth this movie focuses on the part of the guy that is bad instead of making the good transformed one look ""good"". Typical. Clooney is a one trick pony. Once you have seen him you saw him. He looks the same, talks the same, acts the same, says the same things, etc, in all his movies. It makes him unbelievable and reminds you that you are watching a movie. And same for that girl . . . Anna something or another. Do they really write her lines in all her movies (Twilight, Pitch Perfect, etc) to say the exact same thing? She says the exact same words. And that mouth full of teeth . . . is just a distraction. Anyway, I don't understand movies lik this. Telling something that their way of life is bad. That you have to be like this person to be good. Some people like being alone. Some people like being married. Who cares? So in the end this movie wasn't really about anything with all of this going on or not going on depending upon how you look at it.",1442620800,6,1443,4.098939929328622

And keep pretending that this isn't blatant pandering.  On top of that, the choice to make his career one where he fires people and ruins lives for a living is just a colossal downer that drags down the movie's entertainment level significantly.",1442361600,,642,4.853211009174312
3995415,4,B002VECMB8,This is a really well done biopic featuring George Clooney in the role of a man who has insulated himself from the difficulties in relationships that can cause extreme emotional problems but is in itself a major problem as we were not designed to live isolated lives apart from one another. Definitely food for thought as we navigate our modern world and done in an entertaining and disarming manner. Good performances all around and properly paced for this type of story telling. It might leave some viewers wishing for more character info at the end but I think this was a conscious decision on the part of the filmmaker(s).

3995489,5,B002VECMB8,"This is a great story and is well acted. The story line seems to surround super-frequent flyers and George Clooney's quest to reach the 10 million mile club. Airport and hotel travel is the theme that connects all of the pieces but the story is about relationships. Chief is the relationship between Clooney and the female version of his character, played by Vera Farmiga, who is trying to have both the home life and enjoy the thrills of the business elite. The sparring between these road warriors is entertaining and you find yourself cheering for them. Anna Kendrick beautifully portrays a young Ivy League graduate who sweeps in to slay the business dragon and is summarily knocked off her game by the harsh reality that she never imagined in her business model. The movie also features the loss of relationship for long-time, middle-aged workers who are kicked to the cost-cutting curb called reduction in force. The dilemma is if love and home life can possibly fit into the chaotic world of business travel.

After looking at the 1 and 2 star raters, I suspect that this movie connects better for those of us who travel enough to know the business world depicted here, especially those who can recognize by sight the airports and hotels shown in the movie. I'll watch it again.",1441843200,,1285,4.788288288288288

If you do, you'll almost certainly like this movie.  It's based on a novel, and in a good way, that shows through.  It's a thoughtful movie.  I may watch it again.

3995594,3,B002VECMB8,"Summary - George Cluney's character is happier traveling than staying home.
This could have been a likable love story and it certainly does have it's moments. It could also have been a story of self discovery, but what's discovered is pretty shallow. Without revealing anything about the ending, it's fair to say it's not happy. There are moments of brilliance in the dialog, like when Cluney walks through the airport describing his life (""All the things you probably hate about travelling  the recycled air, the artificial lighting, the digital juice dispensers, the cheap sushi  are warm reminders that Im home.""). There are other uber-cynical speeches that don't carry as well (""We all die alone""). Overall, though I enjoyed the movie and was glad it did not follow the formulaic hard-bitten-cynical-traveling man-finds-love story-line, I was, however, left with a feeling that there were better ways I could have spent my 1.5 hours of life.",1436745600,4,945,5.169934640522876

3995601,5,B002VECMB8,"Ryan Bingham is happiest when he's traveling, either when he's at an airport contemplating his next flight, aboard a plane where he can meditate on the world from 30,000 feet, or flopping on the bed of a hotel room where he's treated like royalty. On the road, Ryan Bingham is somebody, a VIP customer who has racked up more flying miles than the equivalent of several trips to the moon. He gets the best hotel rooms, he cuts through long lines, and he can jump into rental cars faster than a speeding bullet without having his life-story entered into a computer terminal. He is one of thousands of frequent-flyer business travelers to whom hotels and rental car companies genuflect; they kiss his ring by offering the best rates, the best rooms, and loads of freebies. His one-bedroom apartment even resembles an hotel room, although from the get-go, we learn he doesn't like being at home. The road is his home and the people at American Airlines are his family. And occasionally he meets a similar bird-of-a-feather, a business traveler of the opposite sex, for a quick fling.

He has an unusual job: to fly to certain corporate American locales and lower the proverbial lay-off ax onto the necks of unsuspecting employees because the company doesn't have the guts to do it themselves. In an age of outsourcing, it shouldn't be surprising that even the dirty job of laying people off can and has been outsourced. Ryan Bingham is the ax men of ax men, firing hundreds of people at a single bound for a plethora of American companies. His own company has come up with a pamphlet that is supposed to ease the blow and convince the poor victim that this is the beginning of a new life. Bingham does his job well (but of course he knows the stupid pamphlet is meaningless), and the upside is he doesn't have to be at home. He does the dirty deed like an assassin-for-hire before heading back to the airport and beginning the cycle all over again. And in between these hits, other companies engage him as a motivational speaker where he likens people and possessions to luggage that drags you down. Of course he advocates traveling light, and not just in terms of what he takes on his business trips.

But then his neat and tidy world comes under threat when a new upstart less than half his age, Natalie Keener played by Anna Kendrick, propagates a more efficient way of doing the dirty work. Instead of paying for all those planes and hotels, the company could simply do the job from a virtual terminal back at the corporate office. Firing can now be done with the efficiency of a skype network video-conference style. The ax can be wielded in a setting that wouldn't be much different from ordering something through a Sears online catalog with a live agent on-screen. Complete virtual outsourcing. (You wonder if their next step would be to outsource the outsourcing to India!) The proposal however would mean no more frequent-flyer miles for Bingham. To add insult to injury, his company instructs Bingham to take the young upstart crow through the process. Now we have two reluctant bedfellows, as it were, traveling all over corporate America.

This was a pleasant surprise of a movie, maybe not for all tastes, but an incredible storyline with an absolutely tour-de-force performance by Clooney who moves from his usual Steve McQueen cool and eventually shows a more vulnerable side. Simultaneously, I wish there existed an Academy Award for honorable mention. One of the best aspects of the film were a few dozen short clips of the people being fired. According to an interview with Terri Gross, the filmmaker Jason Reitman used people who were not actors, but whose only prerequisite to being in the film was that they had recently lost their jobs. They were instructed to remember how they felt when they were fired and react impromptu on camera, something you don't see very often in films outside of reality television. Also high marks for Reitman who finds the appropriate tone and atmosphere for his story. I hope Clooney is nominated for best actor, but I also wish some of the people ""receiving the ax"" could be honored as well. These were not performances exactly but reenactments.",1433030400,,4196,4.7689133425034385

Film about Ryan Bingham/George Clooney, who makes a living terminating individuals.  His company is attempting to make it more streamline, which is why he takes ambitious rookie, Natalie Keener/Anna Kendrick, on the road.  Natalie Keener is both ambitious and nave, and she is still young enough to be broken.

I loved their interaction, and I like that Ryan Bingham understands that it is a bad life, a lonely life, a sorry life, and he wants more.

All the performances are good, human, and endearing.  But the most penetrating parts are those vignettes of people who have lost their jobs, and want to have some value again.

This film is entertaining, but not always easy to watch.  Still great.",1427068800,,881,4.82

3995628,1,B002VECMB8,"I cannot understand how people accept a movie with multiple commercials for a car rental company WRITTEN into the script as entertainment.  This move went way over the top with the commercials.  This was not just Reeses Pieces on the ground or an unspoken shot of a soda on the table, they talked on and on about a company.  I won't even justify it with the name.  I asked others, if they took out all the commercials, how long would the film really be?  Total foolishness and a bad signal to Hollywood that anyone rates this as o.k. with movie goers.  How did you not notice it people? It was in your face.",1424822400,5,607,4.327433628318584
3995629,4,B002VECMB8,"Why have I detested George Clooney?  Let me count the ways.  First, his insufferably smug, cute, knowingly good-looking character in ER.  Then the interviews, in which he always seemed ultra- impressed with how very cool he was

Now comes this modest film with him in the lead role, as a man who spends most of his life traveling [specifically FLYING] from place to place around the US, with the sole job of firing employees as part of corporate downsizing, or right-sizing, or whatever term one wishes to use.  That the script was written in the depths of the recession of 2008-2009 certainly helped give urgency to the plot, but its meant to remain relevant far into the future.

Bosses after all don't really enjoy firing people [at least, most bosses dont].  Besides all the tears and anger and indignation, theres always the possibility they will sue, or even get personal and come back with a gun or something.  Why not just contract out this most odious of jobs to professionals who make it their business to do it?

Clooneys character Ryan expresses his love of life in two sentences: Last year I spent 342 days on the road.  Which meant I had to suffer for 23 days of being at home.  He, like the real-life Clooney, seemed to float along aloofly, never becoming particularly attached to anyone.  Then a couple of things intrude on his merry solitary life.  The things are in the form of peoplewomen, specifically.  One, fresh out of college, who has convinced his boss that they could save 85% of their travel expenses by getting a good T1 line and firing people via videoconference.

Clooney throws up all kinds of reasons why the in-person touch is needed, the real reasons clearly being a) His life of travel will end, and b) Perhaps his OWN job will become obsolete as well?  Challenge number 2 comes in the form of Alex (Vera Famiga) a fellow road-warrior he meets traveling, and finds that they both seem to be developing more than casual feelings about each other

The movie leaves to the very end how this is all going to shake out, but what remains is a chilling depiction of people, working on behalf of corporations, destroying other peoples lives without ever really watching the resultsthe whole metaphor for which is in the title, Up In The Air, and in the opening sequence, in which one sees all kinds of landscapes around the US from around 30,000 feet up in the air.  I was surprised not only at how well Clooney fit his character, but also how he actually ACTED, and acted WELL, in some scenes.

PS: The nicest ""special"" on the Blu-Ray was a short one, about the making of the opening sequence with all the landscapes as seen from high in the air.  A separate small production company made this sequence, which was beautiful, and speak about their job and about how it fit into the film with enthusiasm.",1424736000,,2830,4.622

Parts are funny, sad, humbling and thought-provoking.

The main point that another reviewer made (or shall I say 'pointed out') was that the woman was ""the bad guy"" in this movie.  My view:  It is indeed rare to see the main female protagonist be revealed - as a person with something to hide.  Interesting.  Please take the time to watch this movie!

One thing I did not like was the married Vera F character.  Totally unbelievable.  Let's see - she's married and takes a weekend out of her life for a wedding with her other man.  What cheating married person does that?  Then when said other man shows up unannounced at her doorstep, she goes frigid. No, it's not a good idea to drop in on somebody unannounced, but still.  To give the other man a phone call and call him ""parenthesis"" is the height of coldness and cruelty.  I can't see a married woman doing that - mabye they do tho in real life.

All I could think was, ""This wealthy, well traveled, employed man doesn't have a woman?  Come on!""  Perhaps the one reviewer was right.  Perhaps at the end George Clooney's character dies and that's how he gets his major airline rewards.  Airline rewards - what are those again?",1412035200,,1032,4.449197860962567

3995683,3,B002VECMB8,"By now, youve heard all the accolades being received by Up in the Air, the new film
from director Jason Reitman (who also wrote/directed Juno and more importantly
Thank You for Smokingwhich if you haven't see, you should). Reitman is a
screenwriter/filmmaker whos not afraid to take box office gold and go against
Hollywood customs. He was nominated for an Oscar for his directing of Juno which
also was nominated for Best Picture. This year, he will undoubtedly be nominated again
for both categories for Up in the Air.
Ryan Bingham (Clooneys character) is an executive who travels around the county firing
people until his company decides to try firing by videoconferencingand grounds him.
But not before one last trip with a relatively new employee, Natalie (portrayed by Anna
Kendrick), who proposed the long-distance approach. There are several stories going on
in this tale, masterfully orchestrated by Reitman.
Clooney and Vera Farmiga (who plays his love interest Alex) are completely golden
together. This is their first time together on the big screen but hopefully not the last. And
Kendrick, who has achieved fame via the Twilight series in the supporting role of
Jessica, is fabulous in this film. Along with Kendrick is another actress weve seen a lot
who is proving to be an asset in the supporting role is Melanie Lynskey, who plays
Binghams younger sister in this film. Earlier in the year, she played Matt Damons wife
in the Golden Globe nominated The Informant. (Most of you might know Melanie as
the odd neighbor of Charlie Sheen in the television show, Two and a Half Men.

Another great character actor who you will find in this film is J.K. Simmons in a much
smaller role than even what hes used to doing. Hes best known as Spider-mans boss, J.
Jonah Jameson, in that series of films. In this film, Simmons is being fired by Bingham in
a scene that was a little Hollywood but still very believable and touching. In the scene,
Bingham notes on the resume of Simmons character that he once took a more than
passing interest in French cooking. How much did they pay you to give up that dream?
Bingham asks. The once angry character settles down and says, $24,000 a year. Very
moving for anyone who has ever had to sit on either side of that table. As a bit of trivia,
Simmons was one of only a few actors used during the firing scenes. In most cases the
people used had actually been recently laid off and were asked to conjure their emotions
of the event for the film (source: IMDb.com).
Go see this film if you're interested in entertainment that has depth and style, but then go
rent Thank You for Smoking. Get to know Jason Reitman.",1408406400,,2656,4.6995708154506435

We find very few here.  Vera Farmiga is convincing, charming. I am even now struggling with an intellectual-emotional response to Alex's moral agility.

3995719,4,B002VECMB8,"This movie has grown on me. The first time I watched, I was mainly drawn to see Vera Farmiga, who I wasn't familiar with, and I was also drawn in by a clip from early in the film in which Ryan (Clooney) is showing Alex (Farmiga) his credit cards and airline cards. It was a quick scene, with Ryan just going boom-boom-boom laying down his elite cards. It looked cool. So I watched it.
  I enjoyed the first viewing, though the plot did not follow my very precise wishes in every instance. I was quite impressed with Ms. Farmiga's acting, and Clooney is always reliable given good material. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend without reservation. And winter is the ideal time to watch it. Get your drinks, have the micro popcorn ready to go, snuggle up with your honey if you have one, and enjoy this movie!
SPOILER ALERT: Please stop reading now if you have not seen this movie.

For Readers who HAVE seen the movie, here are my further thoughts.
The second viewing is the one that I got emotionally caught up in. After the initial glow of Ryan meeting Alex, the easy familiarity with which they connect, their confidence in what they do, I expected the film to progress along those lines, only better for both of them. Well, as you know, things didn't exactly just get better. Ryan's set-up, which has matched his personality perfectly, is pulled out from under him. This worried me. I was worried for him, I mean. As we all could, I could see the narrowness of his world, but I identified with him because I am rather alone and friendless myself. I really wanted him to be able to keep doing what he liked. But then when he drive's to Alex's home address, and the kids are scrambling behind her when she opens the door, and the expression on her face, didn't you feel a stab of regret at that point? I did. So the vision promised early in the film, Ryan and Alex happily connecting whenever they could, is gone. I also found it tough to go through Ryan's interactions with his basically estranged family. That turned out OK, but it wasn't a lot of fun. Well, I'm out of ""review energy"" so I'll cut this off. I wish all of you the best in your movie viewing.",1390867200,2,2168,4.401496259351621

3995723,5,B002VECMB8,"Good movie, I enjoyed it. Reminiscent of times past when we shrived to achieve Diamond status each year, so I can relate to the character somewhat. Flying just blows these days, so I'm glad I was finally grounded!",1389657600,,213,4.631578947368421
3995724,5,B002VECMB8,"First, a short list of fun things to do during the movie: Try to decide if Vera Farmiga was more attractive in The Departed before she had a baby. Analyze Jason Bateman having a short beard. Imagine having to fire Zach Galifianakis.

I am fascinated with the Ryan Bingham character to the point where I have rewatched this movie more than any other film made in the last 5 years. Imagine finding job security in firing people for a living. Ryan is employed by a firm who does't consult or audit. They simply send representatives to deliver the bad news on a personal level - an awkward place where bosses and human resources are uncomfortable going. Imagine your place of employment footing the bill to fly someone in, put them up in a hotel and simply giving them a list of employees to terminate: without prejudice.

""Your position is no longer available. Here's a packet that should help you in your transition."" The rep hands you a folder that in that moment doesn't seem at all like a life preserver, it feels like the printed materials the insurance companies send you. You'll put the ""packet"" in a drawer somewhere and ultimately do what everyone does: look for another job. The newly unemployed who react belligerently are more fascinating than Ryan Bingham himself. That's where a terminating representative does their damage control. Ryan puts his own spin on it and explains the positives of being unemployed. Silver haired and golden voiced.

The producers of this movie hired people who had recently been fired and called them in for interviews to vent. I was personally alarmed by the number of people who showed some some sense of entitlement during their firing.  ""What am I supposed to do now?"" was a common question. Of course, Ryan had a perfect response for that we are talking about a pep talk from George Clooney here! On the book version, many people have said that the movie is better. That's rare but give credit to author Walter Kirn for providing the template for an interesting character who just needed some slight enhancements.

Here's why Ryan is so interesting: He's sort of a nonviolent version of Tyler Durden (Fight Club). Instead of starting fight clubs, Ryan tells people to get in a lifeboat. Ryan loves traveling by plane and staying at the Hilton. Ryan is going to pass a nearly unattainable frequent flyer milestone soon and mentions no other goals other than avoiding resistance while traveling. His side project involves traveling to his guest speaking gigs where he talks to people about avoiding commitments and the restrictions of having too many possessions. Between work and demotivational speaking, Ryan consciously avoids leaving the road to go home to his empty apartment. Ryan is always moving like a shark. Ryan lives in the air and in hotels but he's no sociopath because he believes he is terminating people with humility.

There would be no story here except that two game changers challenge this lifestyle. First, Ryan's company hires someone nearly half his age to implement a cost savings measure-by firing people remotely via a Skype interface. If travel is Ryan's reward for firing people, what fun will it be to work exclusively from a home office? Ryan must also take this rookie (Anna Kendrick who plays the role snappy whereas Ellen Page might have played it snarky) on the road with him to prove to her that his realtime, face to face delivery is superior. Secondly, Ryan meets the female version of himself while on the road. On the surface, this love interest does not challenge his need for independence. Ryan is more than happy to adjust his schedule so they are both working in the same city at the same time. Other hilarities ensue as loner Ryan is the only man who can talk his future brother-in-law off a ledge when he gets cold feet on his wedding day.",1389484800,,3827,4.7821482602118

3995744,4,B002VECMB8,"Though the film's title and plot is all about flying and the lifestyle that comes with it, it has a plot that is firmly grounded and therefore enjoyable to watch.  Of course, George Clooney is easy on the eyes.  But Mr. Clooney once again showcases his abilities as an actor, playing a man who allows his life to revolve around his travels and is happy because of it.  But his belief system, which he incorperates into his motivational speeches, is challenged by the arrival of an ambitious new colleague and a fellow traveler who might just be more than that.  I'll readily admit that I've never heard of Anna Kendrick before this film but that she impressed me in this film and I look forward to seeing more of her work.  It's amusing to watch her question the way of life held dear by Mr. Clooney's character, wondering if there isn't another way while silmaltaniously derailing the status-quo with her own ideas.  Vera Farmiga, who came to the audience's attention just three years earlier in ""The Departed"", brings a new role as she seems to be even more invested in Mr. Clooney's way of living than even Mr. Clooney.  This film is interesting as it thankfully never truely preaches in favor of one life or another but instead just shows us the pros and cons of different points of view, leaving it to us to make that ultimate decision.

3995752,5,B002VECMB8,"Up In The Air introduces you to some excellent characters that drive this narrative from start to finish. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a guy with practically no home, no center. He lives to travel, travels to live as he bounces from one city to another as part of his job, which is zany in itself. Bingham works for an outside contractor hired by firms conducting lay-offs. So he gets to fire everyone, which is no easy job. He meets Alex, a funky lady who is a free spirit, or so it seems. They strike up a relationship that seems perfect for both of them. Enter Natalie, an upstart technology expert who thinks Bingham's job can be done via web-chat, thus eliminating the need for Bingham to travel and thereby threatening his entire existence. Of course Bingham is the old hand and Natalie has a lot to learn. Along the way Alex pops in and out, causing Bingham to ultimately question what he's all about. Alex has a bombshell of her own, one that leaves Bingham reeling. This movie is seamless as it weaves the multi-layered drama between Bingham's job and his personal life on the road. However, please note, there are no winners and no losers in this flick, with perhaps (PERHAPS) one exception: Natalie, who finds a way out. It's almost a film noir project (but with no crime and everyone lives). Performances are outstanding, especially the dynamic between Bingham, Alex, and Natalie. When these three are together, it's impossible to look away. The ending will put a lump in your throat and make you think. And that's the way I like my movies.",1377216000,,1556,4.641304347826087

3995763,4,B002VECMB8,"In the 2009 film, Up In The Air, George Clooney portrays Ryan Bingham, a corporate downsizer who travels across the U.S. to fire people. Basically, his corporation sends him in to dismiss employees from their job, so that the employer doesn't have to. As part of his career, Ryan is constantly on the road, or more accurately, in the air for a large portion of his year. He is not close to his family, has a modest apartment that he rarely sleeps at, and has made it his personal goal to ten million frequent flyer miles.

His simple life is threatened when his employer hires an enthusiastic, young recruit, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) to help cut costs. As part of her plan, Natalie wants to fire people through video conference calls, making people like Ryan obsolete. Fearful that this new thinking will bring an end to his way of life, Ryan argues that Natalie is too inexperienced to fire people, and could never understand what he does on a daily basis. To his annoyance, Ryan's boss agrees that Natalie is inexperienced and tasks Ryan with mentoring her as she accompanies him on his travels.

As they begin their travels, we gain a deeper insight into each of the character's personal lives. Through their mismatched personalities and experiences, the two begin to form an understanding of each other. Along the way, Ryan encounters the female equivalent of himself, played by Vera Farmiga, who he quickly falls for. The film then follows Ryan as he tries to find a life for himself outside of an airport, and discover who he truly is.

Based on the 2001 novel by Walter Kirn, Up In The Air is one of those rare movies that actually improves upon the source material. Directed by Jason Reitman (Juno), the film consistently entertains while providing thought provoking commentary on economics and the state of American's social lives. While the novel was mainly made of anecdotes about Ryan's experiences, there is a much stronger narrative arch to the film that all leads to a believable conclusion.

The main character is a severe loner by choice, preferring to live his life ""up in the air"". He works for a company that specializes in firing employees for employers that cannot bring themselves to do it. Many of the people he fires have a hard time dealing with the loss of a job because it will have relationship implications, either with family members or because of the severance of a longstanding relationship to their employer. His colleagues, friends and family also have a number of relationship situations that are explored in the movie. The unique thing about this movie is the relentless travel imagery. The movie only stays in one place for a short period before heading off to another airport terminal, rental car depot or hotel lobby. For anyone who has traveled lately, the thought that someone could actually enjoy that kind of lifestyle is probably jarring. The most ironic thing about the film is that this main character whose disconnected lifestyle depends on his ability to connect with the people he is firing in person is threatened with becoming stationary because of a new system in which the company would be able to fire people remotely via the internet. The actors playing the main characters give a pretty convincing performance portraying their character types and there is a pretty impressive array of bit actors who do a good job playing the victims of corporate downsizing. This isn't the kind of move you watch for action, romance or happy endings. It is a movie that leaves a visual impression.",1362787200,,1826,4.745283018867925

The Movie
Review
By Richard Edward Noble

Well, who doesn't like George Clooney?

I am still a fan of Rosemary Clooney. So there you go.

I had never heard of this movie but I live out in the woods and I get to see most movies long after their prime ... at home.

That companies would hire other companies to fire their old, faithful employees is depressing enough but that a nice guy like George would be one of the nasty company's top hit men only serves to double the depression. But George takes it all in a kind of blue collar heroism.

George is our anti-hero in this movie but his job seems to be the least of his problems. He likes it. What can we say? The fact that he has no problem with this job and that it is not played up in the movie adds to the matter of fact, modern day cruelty that we have all become immunized to these days.

He likes firing people and feels he does it well. Being the companies # 1 hit man doesn't bother him in the slightest.

Now if I hadn't just recently read a book about a guy whose job it was to repossess the homes, fancy estates, yachts and other incidentals of the super-duper, I might have found George's character a stretch. But in today's world, this type thing seems to be the norm.

Consequently, like George, I had no problem identifying with this modern day hit man reality.

But besides having this great job that pays George to fly him anywhere and everywhere, George has an enviable personal life also.

He's a bachelor with a beautiful single's pad and he has a knockout chick who wants him just for his body. She's available around the world. And she just wants to jump Georgie's bones. She doesn't want to get involved. She's every single man's dream girl.

The story has enough twists and surprises to keep even those who didn't go to the movie solely to stare at George Clooney busy.

I was not shockingly surprised by any of the eventual results but I did find them clever and cute and all worth a big smile.

George's conflict with his job comes when the company wants to update and modernize its tactics. Why pay the expense of flying people all over the world to fire other people when they can do the job by Skype technology of sorts.

A TV screen placed in a private room with the victim, reduces risk and costs - no plane fares and no punch in the mouth or other nasty scenes. A person could now possibly do this job from the comfort of his home with no encumbering company conflicts. All these high priced, around the world hit men with large expense accounts to the company, could now be stay at home contract laborers.

The movie has three plots going on at the same time - George's business career which is truly depressing from any moral standard but apparently only to us viewers, played against his personal life which is more optimistic, followed by his affair with the hot to trot Vera.

George has a family and they are normal and nice.

Vera, who has primarily been an erotic part of the George's business adventure, finds herself being invited into George's personal and family business. She goes along.

All three plots end with Rod Serling or Alfred Hitchcock type surprises.

Though the story is truly ""Up in the Air"" the movie is grounded in real time.
Both George and Vera Faminga do a good job making their characters real and believable.

The Hobo Philosopher is a writer and the author of: ""A Baker's Dozen,"" a book of 13 short stories.",1362787200,,3439,4.394321766561514
3995787,5,B002VECMB8,"If you love satirical comedies, don't get offended easily, and can sit through long-building plots, this movie is for you! George Clooney really shows his wide range in skills in this movie, making you bust a gut whether he's delivering a clever monologue or playing off his co-stars. Anna Kindrick flawlessly displays the various facets of a complex character, portraying a young, uptight over-achiever who can also have you rolling on the floor as she brilliantly displays the naive heartbreak of a wide-eyed young adult trying to make sense of her world while attempting to hold together her ""adult"" composure.",1361836800,,613,5.14

3995806,4,B002VECMB8,"It was nice to watch this movie. The plot is not predictable and, thankfully, the characters and writing are without cliches. As someone who has fantasized about living a life in the air traveling the world, what grounds me is knowing the relationships and human connections I would have to sacrifice to have such a life. It was nice to have this movie depict what the reality of a life ""in the air"" would probably be like.

The shocker in the movie for me was the truth that came out about the character Alex. I was not expecting it, but after watching it I'm sure that what she was doing goes on quite a bit in real life. I also liked the scenes with George Clooney's character's family. Their lives came across as just the right kind of boring, but real, especially compared to the exciting, jet-setting lives Clooney's and Anne Farmiga's characters seemed to be enjoying.

In the end, the truth of the emptiness of lives spent ""up in the air"" surfaced. For me, this movie was a lesson in the fact that, yes, real life with houses to take care of and family weddings to go to may not be all that exciting, but it has great value and we need it. No matter how much we can travel the world, that kind of life would be meaningless without people to love, care about, and be committed to. Clooney's character realized this in the end.",1356739200,2,1333,4.392712550607287

I highly recommend this movie!!!",1355788800,,367,4.950819672131147
3995811,4,B002VECMB8,"Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a professional hatchet man. He's not a bad person, and works hard to do his job well and with the minimum of emotional damage. But, let's face it, he fires people for a living. His life, though, his home, is up in the air and in airports and hotels. He takes great pride in the perks of an extremely frequent flier. He can't stand being in Omaha, where he rents an apartment, and where his company is based, and hasn't seen his sisters in years. His tidy philosophy of life, summed up in a speech he delivers about letting go of emotional baggage and needless possessions, is upset by a new woman (Vera Farmiga) in his life and a new plan at work to do their downsizing from a distance, which means he would be stuck working from home.

""Up in the Air"" is a potent little film, tightly told with a pitch perfect script and compelling performances all around. It's funny and a delight to watch from the beginning, but builds into something much more than a showcase for a charismatic leading man. Sure, in a nutshell it can be summed up as a film about the trade-offs between the freedom from attachment and the loneliness of isolation. Still, there's something more here. The film manages to be extremely timely -- in its almost documentary depiction of the devastation that has followed in the wake of the current financial crisis -- and at the same time has the classic feel of an old Hollywood romance between mismatched and star-crossed sparring lovers. The film also addresses the impact on people of the lifestyle imposed by the modern way of doing business, of being up in the air and away from home all the time, and at the same time the film raises questions about what happens to relationships in a time when it's often easier to connect (and disconnect) via text or email or facebook than face-to-face. This is intelligent film making - entertaining to watch, but not mere escapism, and not false in its depictions of the contradictions and conflicts that characterize contemporary American life.",1355184000,,2040,4.650969529085873

Instead, the story is primarily about a man who, by having opted for a job in which he spends more time traveling than at home, pursues his two primary goals: that of avoiding any deep human connections (we're treated to lectures he gives in which he encourages audience members to imagine that a backpack - placed conveniently next to him at his lectern - contains all of the important people in their lives. ""Now imagine lifting it,"" he says), and of achieving 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles. We watch as he (almost) gives up on the former, and achieves the latter. While the manner in which those milestones occur are certainly very entertaining - and worth watching the film for, if you're in the mood for light fare - they're certainly not treated with any depth. There is much more reality and human drama in the brief segments in which people react to having just been fired. I wish the film had spent more time on those, and less time on the significantly less substantial ""main"" story.",1354579200,,1348,4.668067226890757

3995821,4,B002VECMB8,"It's not a romantic comedy but it has some of that vibe.  It's not Character driven drama but it has some of that.  It's not just an excuse for George Clooney to be really cool in a movie again but it has that too.  Up in the Air is a comedy, a character study piece, and a really entertaining film.  George Clooney plays a man who works for a company that other companies hire out to do their ""downsizing"" for them.  Basically he comes in and actually tells people that they are fired.  In the economic environment we are in right now, it's the business to be in.  Clooney's character is much more at home on a plane and in a hotel room than he is in the small, hotel room like, apartment that he spends a few days a year in.  A young woman, played by Anna Kendrick, fresh out of college joins the company with the idea that they could save a lot in travel expenses if they did their work by computer using web-cams.  The boss, played by Jason Bateman, sends her out with Clooney's character so she can experience what the job entails so she can create the new system that will keep the employees at home and not on the road.  Clooney's character is at home on the road and he, of course, hates the idea of being stuck in one place.  During his travels he meets a beautiful co-frequent flyer, played by Vera Farmiga, and they strike up an opportunistic ""relationship"".  This is the closest thing he's had to a real relationship and he begins to rethink his definition of what happiness is.  He's somewhat estranged from his family but is forced to face his family commitment at his sister's wedding.  Anna Kendrick's character basically has the opposite problem.  She wants and needs close relationships and finds that wearing your emotions too close to the outside can be difficult in her new line of work.  This movie works on every level.  It's funny, touching, and thought provoking all at once.  There are a lot of set ups for what look to be cliche' moments that turn in unexpected directions, thank goodness.  We are all pretty sick of the cliche's.  How many times can you watch someone running through an airport because they've found ""the one"" and don't want to lose them?  Well there is a similar scene here but not with the outcome we are used to seeing.  Again, thank goodness.  It's an original film that still has that comforting feeling of relatability.  There will be at least one character you can relate to and that always helps draw me into a film.

3995828,5,B002VECMB8,"It's hard to imagine a better film about the post-Great Recession business world than ""Up in the Air"" (UITA).  What makes UITA such a wonderful film is that is recognizes that businesses are people, and it does an excellent job portraying the feelings, relationships and travails that its characters, both major and minor, go through.  It does so in a way that is compelling, intelligent, nuanced, and at times humorous, as well as touching.  It is well worth a repeat viewing, which is one of my criteria for an excellent film.

George Clooney is perfectly cast in the lead role - it is a role that fully takes advantage of his good looks, intelligence, confidence, smooth delivery, and his ability to, at times, let his inner emotions shine through his outer shell.  Vera Farmiga doesn't have as big a role as Clooney, but she is similarly excellent as the woman who appears to be the perfect match for Clooney's character.  Anna Kendrick portrays a just-out-of-college young businessperson, and her performance accurately portrays the awkwardness and deference of her character.  There is also some excellent work done by the actors with bit parts.

The filmmaking in UITA is top notch:  the cinematography, the settings, the background music, the plot and the overall pacing of the film all show the deft touch of experienced hands.  The storyline is believable and fully captures the viewer's attention, allowing the characters' feelings to be revealed.  Those of us in the corporate world will easily identify with many aspects of that world as portrayed in UITA.

The film starts on a light note, showing us how life on the road (or the plane)looks like for many of those people, traveling for weeks at a time. The main subject itself is anything but funny or light. People are losing their jobs right and left and this film shows, how it is mostly handled by the big corporations. The director was able to show the individual pain that comes with the loss of a job and how the person on the other side of the table can't really feel, what the now unemployed person experiences - until it might hit them too.

3995846,5,B002VECMB8,"""Up in the Air"" is a comedy-drama film that follows the work of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) who informs workers all over America that they are laid off.

Bingham does the dirty work for restructuring businesses as an employee of an independent company Career Transitions Corporation (CTC). His life of travel and shallow living hits a snag though when he is teamed up with fresh faced Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who is looking at ways to reduce travel costs for CTC, but life on the road is where Bingham feels in his element.

For years Bingham has used smooth talk and insincere advice to comfort those that he has fired, yet spending time with Keener, developing a relationship with a fellow work travel junky he comes across, and the marriage of his younger sister combine to undo his world of ostentation.

The film narrative covers many themes such as selfishness, workplace cold heartedness, and reflecting on social attitudes that for a long time provided Bingham with comfort but are exposed to be flawed life compasses.

It is a movie that viewers will be able to relate to in their own ways with an assorted storyline that is at times saddening, often humorous, and philosophically informative.

3995847,5,B002VECMB8,"This movie is hands down my favorite movie ever. Starting with George Clooney, arguably one of the best actors we have right now, and continuing with the rest of this solid cast, and the storyline which I'm still trying to completely figure out, this movie is a true gem.

Ryan Bingham (Clooney) goes through life flying from one destination to another, firing people along the way. He's happy, he's content, he's at peace - until a series of disconcerting and unfamiliar events turn his world upside down. As a minimalist and a single middle-aged male, I identify with this character in a very strong way. I also love flying (and airports!) and I also practice a life of non-attachment and personal freedom. I loved his musings about ""What's in your backpack?"" and his ideas on letting go of possessions and attachments. He's good, he's on a path, he has a number in mind, he just hasn't hit it yet. But he has no idea what *will* hit him next.

This film is full of nuances and little plot developments and phrases that you will remember later in the story and go ""ahhh, that's what he meant!"". Every time I see it (yes, I've seen it several times), I catch something I hadn't noticed before. This film is for thinkers, because you cannot see it and not think and ponder and analyze everything that happens and how the characters were profoundly changed. Again, I cannot say enough good things about this film, and every actor in it are cast just right. If you haven't seen it, I assure you, you want to see it!",1335916800,3,1513,4.538461538461538
3995848,5,B002VECMB8,"The major theme is that top level successes in any given career may have to make unbearable sacrifices.  Frankly, I've always felt a strong dislike for Clooney, but here he finally drops most of his Hollywood smug arrogance and played a character developing real humility, depth, and maturity by the end.  His co-worker, boss, and lady friend are very well written and acted as well.  The final scene is so perfect.",1332979200,2,415,4.816901408450704
3995849,5,B002VECMB8,"Jason Reitman has directed four full-length films and I love them all. Thank You for Smoking and Young Adult are very good, while Juno and Up in the Air are close to perfect. All are a combination of drama and comedy, but Up in the Air has more dramatic elements than the other three.

Ryan Bingham (Clooney) spends most of his life traveling. He flies from one city to another to fire people on behalf of companies who don't want to perform the task. We are told that he spent 322 days on the road the previous year. Although that kind of life would be detested by most people, Bingham likes it. He lives in hotels and his apartment is just an extension of that environment.

The rest of Bingham's time is taken up by giving motivational speeches. His philosophy states that our lives are filled with meaningless possessions, so he asks us to imagine starting over. He also believes that people are weighed down by the relationships in their lives. Whether it's friends, work colleagues, family members or romantic partners, they can be the most significant burdens we face. As a result, Bingham doesn't allow himself to get close to anybody in any type of relationship.

Does that sound depressing? Many of the people who dislike the film cite that as the main reason. I find it poignant, charming, intelligent and very funny.

Bingham's existence is threatened when a potential innovation is considered by his company. Instead of sending representatives all over America, the company may switch to firing people remotely using an Internet connection. The scheme is suggested by Natalie (Kendrick), who is young, eager and ambitious. Bingham insists that she doesn't have a clue about the reality of his job and he's given the task of showing her how it works.

The other major character is Alex (Farmiga). Bingham meets her by chance at an airport terminal and the two discover that they have a lot in common. Their initial meeting is very amusing.

The main strength of the film is its script. Reitman injects humor into serious situations and lightens the mood. I do appreciate that losing your job can be a traumatic event, but Up in the Air doesn't take itself entirely seriously. Another strength is the acting. Clooney is magnificent at delivering humorous lines in dramatic situations and Farmiga gives the best performance of her career to date as Alex.

My favorite scene - and there are many candidates - is probably the first meeting between Bingham, Alex and Natalie. The dialogue is fast-paced and witty and it's here that I know I'm in for an enjoyable ride. The way Natalie is completely oblivious to the fact that she's insulting Alex and Bingham makes me laugh every time. All three actors were nominated for their performances and I can see why.

One of the best moments perfectly blends drama, humor and reality. Bingham shows Natalie how to fire people and one of the unlucky candidates is Bob (J. K. Simmons). Although he's only on the screen for a few minutes, Simmons delivers a memorable performance. He's initially unconvinced by Bingham's words and Natalie's attempts to intervene, but Bingham says something that reaches him. It's such a believable exchange. A potentially explosive situation is avoided and Bob walks away feeling positive about his future.

I won't reveal any more of the plot, but I look forward to every scene when I watch Up in the Air. Bingham is the most intriguing character and it's interesting to see how his relationships and philosophy evolve during the film.

I'm sure that people like Bingham exist. Many have observed that Up in the Air reflects the times in which we live. It focuses on loyalty and the uncertainty present in today's economy. I don't particularly care about its relevance. I watch it every few weeks because I love visiting that world. The final shot takes us into the air once more and there's a moment of silence. It's a perfect way to end the story and suggests peace and solitude. That's exactly what Bingham likes about his job when we first meet him.",1332979200,3,4035,4.792805755395683
3995850,5,B002VECMB8,"2009 was a really good year for movies and this one is no exception. This is one of my favourite movies of all time. George Clooney stars as a man who is a serial traveler for work and essentially lives in airports. He can't form relationships because he is always on the go. The movie makes a deep statement about how freeing and isolating this lifestyle is at the same time. He finally makes a connection with a woman he meets who has a similar lifestyle, but she eventually gives him the shock of his life when he realizes she has a grounded life as well.

There is nothing wrong with this movie. The story, acting, and soundtrack are all flawless. I never tire of watching it. Amazon's Instant Play is a great service, as well.

As a jet-setting lothario who makes his living telling worker bees their jobs no longer exist, George Clooney exudes charm and charisma; we like him even though he's essentially a hitman doing the dirty work of corporate C.E.O.'s. As with TRANSLATION, the outcome is cloudy but never really in doubt. Aided by an impeccable supporting cast that includes Anna Kendrick and the always-reliable J.K. Simmons, UP IN THE AIR should be considered among the front-runners for the year's best movie.",1332028800,,698,5.078260869565217
3995852,5,B002VECMB8,"While I'd hardly be inclined to label this movie as a must-see for everyone, it does work on several levels so as to appeal to a rather wide audience, making it certainly worth most people's while.

I suppose the most recognizable piece of the film is its star, George Clooney. No suspension of reality is required in order to believe the character Clooney is playing; he fits the part real well. So well in fact, that the emotional evocation brought out by his character, Ryan Bingham feels (dare I say it?) real and far from fabricated (though I figure it was, all the more credit to dir. Jason Reitman). A good-looking, globe-trotting bachelor, who has sworn off marriage and any chance at a stable home, Clooney's emotional development throughout the course of the film is what to watch for.

So, forget the planes, hotels and frequent flyer miles; more than any of that, the movie is about a man's solitude (brought about at his own behest) and the loneliness that so often follows when one thinks that they can take on the world all on their own. The difference between being surrounded by people (as Clooney often protests) and actually being with other people, is one that takes the course of the film to discover. While the entire film builds upon this idea, I felt it most evident during the wedding sequence, where Clooney's character returns home almost a stranger. More specifically, there is a scene where Clooney asks his sister if she wants him to walk her down the aisle (evidently after the passing of their father). She informs him she already has someone else. The look on Clooney's face and his subsequent stumbling for words is perhaps the most memorable part the film, at least emotionally. I mean it when I say, you feel his character's pain, and that's quite the accomplishment considering the type of character that he is.

Of course I could go on spilling praise for the rest of the cast, they all worked well, but it really is just Clooney's picture. A film about interconnectedness, isolation, and individualism in the modern world; one can't help leaving the film without thinking that maybe life's better with feet firmly on the ground.",1329868800,2,2167,4.757978723404255

Lots of trends in American society are touched on : downsizing, outsourcing, the provision of services through the internet, the drop in marriage rates, the polarization of society into groups of ""elite insiders"" who are treated like royalty (notably when travelling) and the have-nots.

Altogether a very worthwhile film : the three main actors (Clooney, Kendrick, Farmiga) all play their roles perfectly (see below for one exception). The script is also very good. Something I don't often notice that much : the opening credits and music were a lot of fun.

One issue with the acting : the scene where Kendrick is supposed to cry is either over-acted or was done that way following specific directions (in which case it's the directors fault!). I agree with another reviewer that it doesn't seem to quite capture the introverted miss perfect totally losing her cool(Reese Witherspoon did a much better job at this in Election).

3995860,5,B002VECMB8,"I had a chance to pick this up and didn't know much about the movie other than it is about a frequent flyer.

I had a coffee and popped this on and it was nice to have some extra scenery in the beginning of the film, and the beginning has some jazz and has a nice opening sequence. I think the film is structured like this: Mr Ryan Bingham, is a motivational speaker who also works for a corporation that is currently doing some downsizing, I think it is a retail or construction organization. He has some funny moments with his friend Natalie who is perfect as a new hire at giving video link up pink slips to soon to be former employees. Nice to know, that she took the job to follow a guy who she broke up with afterward by text message.

Through his sister Kara he learns of the marriage of Julie his other sister and is given a cutout of her and her fiance to photograph and locations that he travels to on business. Then he and Natalie go on a cruise in Miami where Natalie does karaoke and then the lights go out on the yacht and they have to take raft boats back to Miami Beach. He also gets his ranking in the airmiles program which entitles him to a platinum membership card and free tickets to be used or given as gifts.

This is more of a comedy than a drama which is what I had thought it was before, it has plenty of one liners that make you pay attention to the dialogue. Jason Reitman who directed this film made an incredible effort to pull together the right people for the right parts for this movie, and structure the scenes the way he did, so they flow together perfectly.

On thw whole, I enjoyed it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.",1320883200,,1652,4.185534591194968
3995861,4,B002VECMB8,"The last time that I reviewed a film starring George Clooney in this space he portrayed a much put-upon, but ultimately triumphant, fixer-man lawyer in the film, Michael Clayton. I mentioned there that you may ""buy"" the fixer-man off, you may knock him around the courts a little with some silly law suit but in no way do you try to kill the bugger when he is doing what he does best, fixing things. Apparently, according the story line here where Clooney plays the hatchet-man for a company that ""fires"" high level people for those who do not want to get their hands messy, or place themselves in the line of fire if things go awry, that same poor judgment prevails here.

Oh no, no one is trying to kill Brother Clooney here, well, except maybe kill his spirit through the huge advances in communications technology that allow a company to avoid the expenses associated with flying all over the place in economic bad times to do the ""canning"" and thus taking away an old school-style job from Clooney that he has become skilled at. It seems that somebody at headquarters got the bright idea to do the whole process by remote control, through computers. And the avatar of that idea was none other than a freshly- minted MBA (played by Anna Kendrick) out to win her spurs in the tough world of high-tech software innovations. Along the way though, as she tags along with Clooney on his aero-rounds, she gets ""religion"" and steps away to find a more socially useful way to flaunt her skills.

But back to George. See, he can see the writing on the wall a little but he is determined to run a rearguard action to defend his reason for existence, his style. Here he is clearly the first, well maybe not first but close, post-modern plastic card man who like Saul Bellows' Dangling Man, or any one of a number of John Updike's modern men, lives a purely existential life, and likes it. With the exception of a baffling relationship with a fellow female business-class traveler (played by fetching Vera Farmiga) who, shockingly (to Clooney) and incongruously (to me), turns out to be just another soccer mom on a lark his life, his solo life, is lived in hotels, airplanes, and rental cars. By the way (BTW for the cyber-slang crazed) George Clooney's cool, clinical demeanor, and his quietly-determined quest for ever more frequent-flyer miles is perfect in this role. But one more time-don't mess with the fixer-man, or the hatchet-man, not if his name is Clooney. Got it.",1319673600,,2469,4.673563218390805
3995862,5,B002VECMB8,"This movie  received almost universal acclaim by mainstream critics when it was first released.  Of the few that didn't like it, the commentary seemed to be more about the subject of firing people from their jobs.  George Clooney stars as Ryan who works for a company that handles employment terminations for other companies that don't have the balls to do it themselves.  Hell, I never even knew companies like that existed.  Clooney is cool as a cucumber in the role as you might expect.  He has no real home, or even financial or emotional objectives.  He just wants to fly and live in hotels across the country.  His only goal in life is to become the 7th person to fly 10 million miles on American Airlines.  American, Hilton and Hertz are prominently featured throughout the movie which I suspect help keep production costs down.  Ryan hooks up with another frequent flyer played by Vera Farmiga.  They become sexually entangled as they cross paths in various cities.  As part of a planned less personal approach to terminations Ryan brings with him a new, bright recently hired addition to the firm.  Natalie is played with unusual wit and sophistication by Anna Kendrick.  While not romantically involved, she and Clooney really work well together.  Kendrick is not your usual knock-out-gorgeous woman, but let's hope she gets more meaty roles like this in the future.

He's a professional fire man, who personally fires surplus employees on behalf of companies across the USA and obsessively clocks up air mile privileges along the way. Clooney's relationships with colleagues, a girl he meets in transit, sister and family act as counterpoints to his otherwise lonely existence. Old and contemporary themes find a home here in the pursuit of love and life's meaning amid the background detachment of modern air travel. The human drama and fragility of the characters from the fired (not actors but people fired in life) to those doing the firing holds your interest throughout.

3995865,2,B002VECMB8,"*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*

I'm trying to decide if my disappointment in this movie is due to all the hype it got during its awards season, or if I would've disliked it as much anyway. It was entertaining enough and moved along quickly, but when the credits rolled, I was left confused about why it was so lauded.

I didn't like any of the characters in the movie. The main character, Ryan Bingham, is the most developed and the most tolerable, mostly thanks to a nuanced performance by George Clooney. But when the movie ventures into some cliched romantic comedy moments (complete with Bingham suddenly dropping everything in the middle of a lecture and going running through an airport to see his beloved) it gets a little hard to watch.

The two main female characters are both awful in different ways. Natalie, a book smart but naive hotshot fresh out of college, is hired to completely overhaul the workings of what seems like a successful, well-established company that she has no experience at, in a field she's never worked in. During their professional travels together, Natalie takes it upon herself to angrily lecture Bingham about his lifestyle choices, the gall that he displays by not wishing to get married and have children, as if she had never heard of such a thing. I found that to be annoying and rude. Who talks like that to a coworker? But of course, that talk leads to an epiphany for Bingham.

Natalie also makes a huge show of bawling into Bingham's arms in a hotel lobby because her boyfriend broke up with her. It was such a ridiculous and over-acted scene, obviously played that way for comic effect, but it just made her look even more green and unprofessional. I couldn't suspend my belief enough to accept that a kid like that would manage to get hired to do that job.

Alex, the other female lead, seems more promising until her big shocking secret that ruins everything is revealed near the end. As far as I know, there was nothing hinted at that made us think she was anything other than an unattached, single woman, so that was disappointing. The writers could've kept her at least somewhat respectable by having her ultimately reject Bingham just because she wishes to not be committed to anyone, but instead she's just a manipulative woman cheating on her husband and lying to her family. Great.

The other negative is that the product placement of American Airlines and (to a lesser extent) Hertz was really distracting. It makes sense that a business would use a single airline and car rental company for its trips, but the extent to which the camera repeatedly lingers over the logos and slogans of American Airlines is too much. The characters also like to discuss all the perks they get from flying American Airlines. Sadly, all the product placement starts to make the movie feel like more of an American Airlines commercial than anything else.",1311120000,3,2892,4.750996015936255
3995866,5,B002VECMB8,"A very strange film that proposes no way out in the crisis situation which is part of everyday life in the USA: firing and getting fired. Today quite a few businesses have outsourced the processing of these firing procedures. So a business specialized in firing people comes into the picture to do it properly, to make limbos presentable and hell palatable, heaven-like if you want, with some nice words and a lot of mind manipulation.

These professional firers are plane people who can fly nearly 320 days a year and spend exactly 7 times 24 hours boarding planes in one year. They have very strict requirements about traveling light and traveling on light and flexible wheels. Home is airports all over the USA, some day all over the world. And they learn how to live with light sushi, and accepting or refusing a ""cancer"" when the stewardess proposes them ""a can, sir"".

They thus learn how to wrap up horror and death on a slow fire and so many other evils in the shiny suits of rebirth, a new beginning, an opportunity to excel in a new field of creativity. They forget the suffering they are going to create or even the death they are peddling day after day, be it jumping from a bridge, or slow poisoning on alcohol, or just triggering some fire arm.

But on the other side the younger ones out of Cornell University or some other high-rise higher education schools are just developing a new technique based on the Internet and communication tools and technologies to dehumanize firing by making direct contact, even be it only eye contact, impossible since two screens, two cameras, two mikes, two modems and a telephone line are between the firer and the firee. That's what  they are told and taught in these deluxe schools that can wrap any crap in gold to make us think it is a nugget or a piece of chocolate.

But Clooney brings another dimension in his airport ever perambulating home: that is to say just not being alone. Of course in those terminals and in those planes you can always find some human contact, be it purely professional and paid for, or be it some person casually met in a bar or restaurant, or for the more deprived be it only a chambermaid, or as for that a chamber-""valet"" or plain janitor. But he shows us how at one moment in this life the traveler will want some more permanent or regular contact and meeting. But that is nothing but an appearance meeting an appearance and hell it is for the one who believes this appearance, on this side or on the other side, is the real thing. Harder will the fall be, and harder is the fall.

A small film showing the total artificiality and somewhere absurdity of that civilization based on transience and mobility and rootless-ness and professional distance and non-empathy. Cruel but absurd. Samuel Beckett at its highest acme.

3995867,3,B002VECMB8,"Not a bad film at all, really, but one that I feel was somewhat overrated amidst all the hype and hoopla that it received during the 2010 Oscar push - a fact, I suspect, that was due more to the film's timely topic of unemployment and economic strife than anything else. And yet the script, for all of its timeliness, really doesn't break any new ground plot-wise (it's another middle-age man in crisis set-up) or pry much below the surface of its characters and scenario. But at least the direction is reasonably assured, and the acting is fairly solid. Clooney's performance, while not quite on par with his turn in ""Michael Clayton,"" is another in his increasingly solid body of work. Vera Farmiga is just fine, even if her character is a tad underdeveloped. The real scene-stealer here, however, is Anna Kendrick, who practically walks away with the show as Clooney's young protg. Despite my lukewarm reaction to the pic as a whole, there are a few very memorable scenes. The sequence in which a series of employees are fired is pretty dead-on in it awfulness; and another, more muted scene between Clooney and the sisters that he hasn't seen in years is quietly devastating.",1310169600,8,1179,4.7560975609756095
3995868,5,B002VECMB8,"I rarely give 5 stars in my reviews; Up In The Air was so good I have no choice but to do that. George Clooney was terrific as Ryan Bingham, a cynical consultant who goes around the country firing people. A very shallow man, concepts like romantic love are alien to his character, whose main desire in life is to accumulate millions of travelers' miles. As the movie progresses, Ryan develops into a much more likable human being who realizes how empty his life truly is. When he reaches his miles goal, he realizes it's utterly insignificant.

Clooney's costars are terrific as well--Ryan's would-be girlfriend, Alex, is played well by Vera Fermiga. Alex is a frequent traveler who also avoids long-term commitments, so she and Ryan naturally become close.  Anna Kendrick plays Natalie, a  too smart for her own good college grad who is forced to travel with Ryan but doesn't understand or approve of his life choices.

Another great thing about Up In The Air is the non-formulaic ending. It doesn't end quite as neatly as many similiar movies. Clooney's character grows as a human being, but he falls short of his ultimate goal.

Buy it, rent it, whatever... this is a must see.",1306713600,,1180,4.736585365853658
3995869,3,B002VECMB8,ok movie - a bit slow but tolerable and entertaining. I don't like the way Anna Kendrick talks: total loss of femininity that is so common in US among some women.,1306627200,,162,4.258064516129032
3995870,4,B002VECMB8,"What I really like about this film is that it deals with contemporary topics like unemployment and making commitments. George Clooney's character, Ryan, is hired by various companies to fire employees, and feels that living  and loving without any strings attached is perfect for him. When his boss suddenly announces he wants to cut costs by having Ryan make layoff announcements through videoconferencing instead, he tries to prove why dismissing people in person is a much better option. A new employee who proposed the idea of videoconferencing accompanies him, and both of them learn a lot about this industry as well as about life itself.

A couple of people argued that this movie is boring. It's true that ""Up in the Air"" doesn't contain fast-paced action or dramatic special effects, but this isn't the movie to watch if you're looking for any of those. What ""Up in the Air"" does provide is a relatively unpredictable, satisfying movie that most people can understand if not relate to themselves. And it might even teach you a lesson or two. Many employers in this recent recession had to fire devoted workers because of the need to cut costs, and since laying people off was such a daunting task, Ryan and others like him were hired to do it. But then, Ryan's company began to go through a similar transformation.

One issue this film raised for me was what kind of company costs should be kept despite harder financial times, as Ryan was trying to prove that his expensive plane tickets were worth defending. I thought the overall message of the movie was a bit ""up in the air"" and unclear, but otherwise, it was a great film.",1303603200,,1637,4.757042253521127

3995872,5,B002VECMB8,"In a time when our world changing far too quickly, there is always a film that comes along to define the sign of the times. This time George Clooney takes us into the mind of a man who just flat out hates being around people and involved with their lives. Guess what he does for a living? He has to fire people from their jobs and connect with them in order to motivate them to find a new opportunity.  So now what do you do when your line of work is telling you have to stop avoiding all connections and stay grounded? That is what the film `Up In The Air' is all about.

I knew that there was a huge buzz about this movie and I have to say I got a lot more than I expected out of this movie. First of all the cast is crazy amazing. Everyone from Clooney to Kendrick plays their roles unbelievably well. Anna Kendrick was of course my favorite, just because I was in her exact position not too long ago. I remember learning the tricks of the trade in my line of work and traveling to sit down with prospects. I remember sitting in a car almost crying because I found the job to be too much or just wondering if I was going to able to do this on my own for a living. What I loved about the film the most was how it depicted how distant we are becoming as a creature. How we break up with our significant others over a text message or that we can't sit face to face in the room with someone when we have to give them negative news. It shows that it turns us into soulless and spineless people. Whether you would agree with my views or not...that was what I got out of this film. Understand that this film can depress you at points, but it is a comedy and it has some great laughable moments and yes you do get a nice ending.

This is a movie that I recommend you see at least once, because it just a story about ordinary people trying to live the lives they want to live. That is something we as individuals do every day. The question is what makes you stand out amongst the others.",1299715200,,1981,4.035623409669212

He goes on a roadtrip with a neophyte hotshot that gets him to think a bit more.  They see a succession of airports, hotels, and wounded faces.  It is really quite depressing, but also very funny, kind of warm but knowlingly superficial.

3995875,5,B002VECMB8,"Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)  has carved out a life of weightlessness (almost).  He's an executive for an out-placement firm that is engaged when a company needs to get rid of large swatches of their employees.  He's pared down his existence to a single carry-on; so much so that he's beginning to carve out a side career teaching others how to shed their possessions, their obligations, even their relationships and loved ones.

He lacks one of the key elements of what it is to be human.  He's almost estranged from his family, he has no wife, no kids, no pets, not even a houseplant.  He does have a good business relationship with his boss, his assistant, and that's pretty much it.  He is so detached that he doesn't even notice anything is missing.  But, things will soon happen that shake up his world.

On first viewing, I admired the acting (especially Clooney), the set design, the lighting, the cinematography, and the sound.  The story itself was clever, but the movie watcher really knew what was going to happen.  Bingham was going to experience something (or someone) that would make him realize that his goal of being the seventh person to achieve the coveted 10 million mile status (the youngest to get there) paled in comparison to his startling lack of human involvement.  The movie was extremely well directed (by Jason Reitman) and well achieved, but curiously non-involving.  It's good, but it's not a film that will be taken down from the DVD shelf very often.

It's only after watching the commentary with director Reitman that I really appreciated the craft of the movie.  This commentary is why DVD special features were invented.  Playing the movie with the commentary on added a whole other dimension to the film.  Reitman grew up on Hollywood, his dad produced the film (Ivan Reitman), and he has many, many stories to tell about the making of the film.  So many, in fact, that he hardly ever stops talking.  There are two other members of the crew on the commentary, but you seldom hear from them.  Reitman just won't let them get a word in.  He's good and very entertaining to listen to, but why even have the other guys there?  And yet, he is entertaining as hell.  What a great dinner companion he would be.  Once he got going, you'd just sit back and listen.

I do have to also comment on the film's 'fired folks'.  Some of them are actors, but most of them are non-actors who were asked by Reitman to appear on camera and sort of relive their own firings.  These non-actors were very, very good, and certainly lent an air of authenticity to the film.  A stroke of brilliance to include these people.

Three and a half stars for 'Up in the Air'.  Four-and-a-half for the DVD extras (there's also an interesting interview with the company that did the opening shot, and other aerials in the film).

November 2015 update:  I've upped the rating to a full five stars.  The reason:  I have good memories of this film, and I've recommended ti to others, who have enjoyed it as well.  It's really a great melancholy film, with a nuanced portrayal of a 'lost' man in a harsh world.",1298246400,29,3109,4.631868131868132
3995876,5,B002VECMB8,"In ""Up in the Air,"" Ryan Bingham works for an Omaha, Nebraska-based company that provides ""transition assistance."" What that means is that Bingham flies all over the country telling employees whose own bosses are too chicken to do it themselves that they're fired. Given the horrible contraction of the US economy, this 2009 release could not have been more perfectly timed. For many people whose friends and family have been laid off, it's probably too painful to watch.

Bingham spends about a month a year at home in a tiny, sterile apartment. The rest of the time, he's speeding through rental car agencies, airports, hotels and corporate offices, racking up frequent flier miles, firing people and giving the occasional motivational speech about ""getting rid of your baggage,"" both material and human. Everything Bingham owns fits in a carry-on, he avoids his family, and his social life seems limited to the occasional hook-up with female business travelers who are as on-the-go and commitment-phobic as he is.

George Clooney gives a career-best performance as Bingham. Maybe it's just Clooney's personal charm, but he manages to convey just enough grudging compassion and decency that we find ourselves rooting for Bingham. When a 23-year-old business school graduate, Natalie, convinces Bingham's boss that the company can save a fortune in travel costs by firing its clients' employees over the Internet, Bingham does his level best to persuade them that's just too cold. It's too good a joke to spoil by telling it in detail, but he also does something to help his soon-to-be-married sister, even though it inconveniences him. I like Clooney but often find his acting a little dry for my taste. Here, playing the coolest of characters, he comes off oddly humane, empathic and vulnerable.

""Up in the Air"" has a fine supporting cast. Vera Farmiga plays Alex, one of Bingham's female business travelers. She's a great match for Clooney, a perfect foil for him temperamentally and pleasantly age-appropriate. Anna Kendrick does a wonderful job conveying the conflicting intellect and emotions of the anxious-to-prove-herself Natalie. Natalie's smart and full of profit-maximizing theory but she's not quite as tough as she thinks she is.

Director Jason Reitman had already convinced me he's excellent working with actors. With ""Up in the Air"" he's working with a witty script that's not burdened by the painful over-cleverness of his earlier film ""Juno,"" and he and his DP and set designer display a great sense of visual style. This compassionate film threatens to veer off into sentimentality but finally stays true to its characters. Strongly recommended.",1296086400,,2667,5.224299065420561
3995877,4,B002VECMB8,"Jason Reitman, like his famous father, is able to take even the most preposterous setup and turn it into an entertaining film with a keen eye for the human condition.  Ryan (George Clooney's character) flies about the country working for a firm that fires people.  This is somewhat of a gimmick - Reitman even filmed actual employees who had been downsized, asking them to re-enact their behavior when they were fired (or even to act as they ""in hindsight wished they would have acted""), and there are some genuinely noble and passionate observations to be made in these scenes.  In a lesser movie, Ryan would merely serve as the witness to their tragedies.  Instead, we are invited into the world of transients that Ryan inhabits - one of airports, 2-hour friendships with the guy sitting next to you on the flight - and Ryan's sharp observations on the fundamental isolation of human beings give us the first layer of the film.

The second layer is provided by the three women in Ryan's life - the woman next door with whom he has a ""neighbours with privileges"" arrangement, a fellow frequent flyer with whom he has ""frequent flyer privileges,"" and a young new co-worker who is trying to make his job obsolete.  I'm sure the first woman would not even be mentioned in most reviews, but her part, albeit small, is critical to the plot.  When Ryan comes home (to a souless apartment he sleeps in only 50 days of the year) his neighbour pops by for a chat.  It's clear that they have been sexual partners, but Ryan immediately back off when she tells him she's ""seeing somebody now.""  This is what establishes our sympathy for Ryan - he is essentially moral, unlike the sleazy bosses he is surrogate for.

That leaves the other two women free to serve as Ryan's antagonists.  Alex is a fellow frequent-flyer and business woman with whom he has an explicit agreement to meet up with for sex whenever their travel schedules overlap.  She states at the outset that she is just as independent and shackle-free as Ryan, but implies otherwise in numerous conversations that follow.  The unfortunately named Natalie Keener is the keen new co-worker aiming to revolutionize the business by eliminating the need to travel and enabling her and Ryan's company to save millions in airfare.  That this would destroy Ryan's way of life immediately sets him against her, but he smartly frames it as a professional discussion about how badly the company would fare if they became just another cheap hatchet-job operation.  Natalie sets off with Ryan to see ""how the job is done,"" and the three of them (Ryan, Natalie, and Alex) form a kind of triumvirate trolling the airport hotels.  Their conversations on life, love, and commitment form the actual heart of the movie - Ryan cynically independent, Natalie the the traditional romantic (talking and texting her boyfriend every night, having rejected offers from the most prestigious law firms in the big city to follow him to his new job in Kansas), and Alex occupying the middle ground as a sort of mediator.

We are now at the 2/3 mark of the film and all is well.  Unfortunately, either from studio pressure or through some sort of internal need for closure, Reitman allows the film to drift off into a more standard cookie-cutter resolution.  I'm okay with the fact that Natalie is given a closed story-arc because her character is designed for that purpose.  I'm okay that Ryan shows her up in a great scene of redemption where he notices something about the man he's firing that allows him to give the fired man hope and promise for a more satisfying life.  Again, I can forgive this scene as it is so well acted and contains such humanity (and because the fired man is played by Reitman's good-luck charm J.K. Simmons).  What I can't forgive is the whole-hearted and sudden transformation of Ryan from lone wolf to den-mother and the resolution of his relationship with Alex.  It's not so much the resolution itself, but the fact that the relationship was resolved that left me unsatisfied.  It's almost like it came from a different, more conventional movie, and it discolours all the events preceding it in such a way that it even spoils the film's re-watchability.  I wish Reitman would have taken a note from Sophia Coppola's playbook - we don't hear what Bill Murray's character says at the end of ""Lost in Translation"" because it would ruin the rest of the film (no matter what was actually said).

So we're left with a film that is excellent for about 3/4 of the time.  The good news is that most films are never good, and I'm thankful for those 3/4.  So I rate this film a 4/5 mainly because it let me down at the end with what I consider to be an artificial resolution.  For those buying the DVD, the director's commentary is actually fairly entertaining, and shows Reitman to be a thoughtful and interesting filmaker, and I look forward to his next project.",1295740800,,4908,4.714285714285714

His love interest played by the very talented Vera Farmiga really adds depth and there's also a dramatic twist at the end that I never saw coming. Anna Kendrick is also good in this film, her character is very naive in the start but by the end, she becomes a more compassionate and well-rounded person.

3995879,5,B002VECMB8,"George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick give the best performances of their careers in Jason Reitman's Up in the Air.  In the movie (an adaptation of Walter Kim's novel), Clooney plays a man that flies around the country to fire people and business is booming.  He is a man that values a life free from any kind of connections or attachments whatsoever and treasures his 300 plus days of life on the road.  In fact he is shooting for 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles that would make him part of a selected group of individuals.  While on the road, he meets Vera Farmiga's character.  As she puts it, she is exactly like him but has a vagina.  When he returns home, he is introduced to Anna Kendrick's character.  She wants to computerize the firing process in order to reduce costs.  Fearing that his life on the road is in jeopardy, he takes her on the road with him to show her that firing people face to face is better than doing it over a computer screen.  There are many things that make this film unique.  Real life victims of firing were in the film and they relived some of their experiences.  Another thing is that we end up liking Clooney's character even though he can be a very unlikable one at times.  We see his entire philosophy in action but end up liking and feeling sorry for him by the end of the film.  That is a remarkable feat in itself.  Finally, there are many ways to describe this film.  One could say that it is a film about a man that goes around the country firing people.  Another could say it is about a man trying to obtain 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles.  Another could say that is about a man finally willing to make a connection with another person.  One more could say that it is about the country's recession.  In fact, it is all of these.  Jason Reitman deserves credit for being able to combine comedy and drama in order to create not only one of the best films of 2009 but also one of the best films ever made.",1295136000,3,1957,4.3535911602209945
3995880,4,B002VECMB8,"If you have any experience with a large corporation as of late, Up In The Air is a film that may make you squirm with emotional discomfort. The recognition of the cold, unresponsive attitude of upper management driven to have greater profits at the expense of a loyal work force seen only as ""inventory"" is almost too much to watch. Up In The Air is character driven, and the thin story is played out through those experiences.

I both loved and hated this film. The knowledge that Clooney's charming and handsome portrayal of a corporate hatchet person was just that -- charming and handsome -- did nothing, for me, to soften the ultimate recognition that these positions are often filled by sociopaths who glory in the opportunity to damage others. Jason Bateman's cavalier approach to this business was perfection as he found new and more damaging ways to suck more profits from his trade.

I could not help but view Up In The Air through a lens of current financial and corporate reality, and the experiences of friends and family around me. It's hard to believe that anyone could view it without being smacked in the face by the real pain suggested here. See this film, but only if you feel you could deal with renewing that pain in all of Hollywood's ""glory.""",1294963200,,1265,4.668161434977579
3995881,4,B002VECMB8,"`Up In The Air' is a film that follows a man called Ryan Bingham (played by George Clooney) who travels around America firing people for various businesses and clocks up millions of air miles in the process. He prides himself on his independence and ability to have no responsibilities or commitments and seems to live a highly charmed life. That is until a young woman joins his company and tries to change the business model so he will eventually become grounded and virtually obsolete himself. He also strikes up an unusual relationship with a fellow traveller which starts to break down his hard outer shell and brings some real warmth to both Bingham and the film. Although there are some very funny moments in this film, this is not an outright comedy and in fact by the end it is tinged with a certain amount of sadness. Clooney plays his role excellently and I don't think I have seen him act as well as in this film. He is charming, detached, vulnerable, funny and more besides and manages to portray his character superbly. The other actors are also very good and Vera Farmiga is great as the fellow traveller who wends her way into his life. This is a gentle film and is very well written and this had me laughing out loud at times and also feeling a certain sadness at the end as well. The direction is great and I feel this to be one of Jason Reitman's better films to date and if he carries on like this then things can only get better. All in all this made for just over 100 minutes entertaining viewing and whilst it has a slightly downbeat feel to it, you will still reach the end having enjoyed it and with a sense of satisfaction.

Off hand I can think of two: not nominating Christian Bale for one of the greatest youth roles in the history of cinema, as 'Jim' in Spielberg's epic 'Empire of the Sun' and two not nominating Streisand as Best Director when Conroy's adaptation of the stellar 'Prince of Tides' was nominated for Best Picture.

Here then is another foible of incoherent nonsense the Academy offered as a Best Picture for the cravings of absolute boredom and ineptness. This truly was a gawker, a complete and total meltdown of cinema.

""Oh look at me, I'm an intellectual, oh look at me, this movie is for me, oh look at me the rabid coherent neanderthal who thinks anyone that doesn't 'get' this film, is sub-par to most other human beings, because we only like 'bam bam-knock em dead movies', oh look at me and my elite, upper east side tupaware party, PTA mom friends who will get together for dry martini's after this viewing and talk about how 'emotionally gratifying' it was that a film can touch on the 'pseudo' elites lifestyle.....oh look at me, I'm sophisticated, and well if you aren't you just won't get the film, so go watch it again, and if you still don't get it, well then go back to your Transformers, because your feeble mind could never grasp something so pure, driven; a film with such subtle nuances that it touches at the very heart and soul of life...""--->

Yeah that is what people say to those who give this work of contemptible garbage 1 star. Ohhhhhh all art housey, all bon vivant style acting, from the upper crust of gutter stylish hollywood. Ohh 'it so relates to our times in a way that the actors really touch on personal issues facing all of us and the deeper meaning of and endless search for happiness, when happiness is wafting all around us'. The Academy is an utter atrocity, nominating films like this and the horrid, deplorable Hurt Locker...but then again we know why Formiga Vermigo, Fermogo Verpevo, got nominated because of that little article in that big publication...save it, Nominations have raraly been about the pinnacle of the craft, if that were the case people like Sam Rockwell, Ed Norton, Mike York, Liam Neeson, Sam Elliott, John Malkovich and Joe Levitt, would have won multiple times, for multiple roles..... wahhhhhhh wahhhhh wahhhh

3995883,2,B002VECMB8,"You know those films that think they are so smart; the ones that brow beat you with their `message' but wind up blowing a lot of hot air for nothing, because they don't even know how to make their message come across as anything truly substantial?

`Up in the Air' is one of those films.

The basic premise behind `Up in the Air' is that of Ryan Bingham, a loner of sorts who ruins peoples lives for a living.  He is hired out by cowardly bosses to fire their employees.  He spends his life segregated from society and works his hardest to avoid any form of commitment, going as far to do motivational speaking where he instructs others on how to remove commitment from their lives (empty the backpack).  When Bingham's company sets in motion a change that will ground Bingham (who travels around the US to fire people) and forces him to fire individuals via internet conference, he starts to panic.  His self centered tendencies kick in, in the guise of mock concern for the people on the other end, and he finds himself traveling with a young business woman who is pimping the new system in order to `show her how it's done' so-to-speak.  Add to this an intoxicating woman named Alex who is just like Ryan, and you have a recipe for a mid-life crisis.

Sadly, this films immature construction and poorly explored themes results in a mediocre attempt to capitalize on potential.

I have a lot of minor issues here that culminate into one gigantic problem; the film is just too shallow, despite it's overabundance of overbearing `points'.

Director Jason Reitman has a specific style to his direction that serves itself better suited for lighter fare and younger crowds.  His take on `Juno' in 2007 is an example of his talents better directed.  He created something fresh and sincere and in tone.  I even thought that his sarcastic touches on `Thank You For Smoking' were nicely placed and propelled the story (no matter how underdeveloped the film really was).  Sadly, his directorial approaches here are just out of place and distracting.  The film comes across like a poorly realized `television movie' thanks to the carefree effervescence he lends to each scene.  It is so airy and light and thus devoid of necessary weight.  The film seems to be trying to hard to be young, and it is not a `young' story.  The film also doesn't know how to make the most of the key scenes.  Take for instance Ryan's talk with his future brother-in-law.  It just seems so anticlimactic, especially for a scene that is designed to shed light on Ryan's personal shifts.  The script is just horrendously fleshed out.  The ending dives off the edge into an endless barrage of clichs that try to (quickly) validate all the personality shifts in the central characters.  The endless finger pointing at Ryan's way of living was also a deterrent (not to mention that disgusting abuse of narration).  It was like Reitman thought his audience was too stupid to draw the right conclusion about Ryan's character and so he felt it necessary to remind us at every opportunity that his life was all about solidarity and that no one else around him (outside of Alex) understood him; thus he is abnormal.

But of course he's not strange; he's just confused...right?

The acting was a saving grace, although I'll never understand the praise and accolades heaped upon Anna Kendrick, who was fine but far from noteworthy.  George Clooney was charming and sincere and likable despite his unlikable tendencies.  In other words; he was very comfortable playing himself and it showed.  Whatever.  Vera Farmiga though, was a triumph and I'm so glad she was recognized by Oscar.  What she does with Alex is beyond words amazing.  She actually creates a character who is well rounded, understandable and three dimensional.  When her character is truly uncovered you sense all the layers of this woman stripping away and it is gloriously handled with a simple stare.  Farmiga is a master actress and I'm so glad that this film gave her the chance to make her name better known.

In the end I'm struggling with this one.  I mean, the whole `we are poignant because our current economic state is a mess' angle just didn't do it for me.  The ending collection of `confessions of the unemployed' was embarrassingly unnecessary.  It just felt like a lazy `tag on'.  The film isn't that invested in the idea that our current state of affairs is that relevant to Ryan's story.  This is a story about a man-child who needs to grow up.  Just because he happens to fire people for a living doesn't make his situation any different than 90% of all the other man-children depicted in cinema today.

Yes, we all need to realize that a job doesn't make us but it is the people who surround our lives that make us who we are.  I get that.  Watch `Days and Clouds' for a film that really understands the weight this economy has on a person.  For `Up in the Air', the economic crisis is just a gimmick to attract unwarranted attention.",1293494400,3,4978,4.684331797235023
3995884,5,B002VECMB8,"This hybrid comedy-drama-romance is a rare treat that honestly addresses job loss, love and relationships without resorting to common cliches or contrived situations. George Clooney and co-star Vera Farmiga are reminiscent of Cary Grant and Deobrah Kerr in An Affair To Remember.

Vera Farmiga is the strong, female co-star Clooney has long needed. She is beautiful, sophisticated and restrained, similar in many aspects to Brigit Bardot and Sophia Loren. She is Ukrainian but was raised in America. However, she did not speak English as a child which probably explains her elegant restraint when speaking English. Men will truly enjoy the brief but wonderful scene of Farmiga naked in Clooney's motel room. Wow, what a hot body.

Clooney is superb as a confident, insensitive but charming employee terminator during the economic collapse of 2008. Clooney works for a corporate consulting company based in Omaha, Nebraska that performs the dirty work for spineless business owners. It is a thriving business during the 2007-2009 recession. This movie was released during late 2009.

Clooney as Ryan Bingham boasts that during the previous year he spent 322 days on the road, flying from city to city in pursuit of victims. But, one day while sitting a hotel bar, he initiates a conversation with Vera Farmiga playing Alex Goran, a fellow road-warrior and corporate shark, equally consumed by frequent flyer perks and privileges. They end up in bed but the traditional, cliche love story never evolves.

The script is superb as is Farmiga who previously appeared in The Departed by Martin Scorsese and the 2004 remake of the Manchurian Candidate. Obviously, she is not an obscure actress but this role was meant for her. She plays her character with incredible charm, grace and sexual vitality telling Clooney ""Just think of me as yourself with a vagina."" Although captivated by Clooney's charm and appearance, Alex always remains his alter-ego much to his dismay.

In the end, Clooney is consumed by a life free from personal responsiblity and the daily toil of earth-bound inhabitants as he pursues his goal of becoming the seventh person in the world to achieve 10-million frequent flyer miles. I don't know if American Airlines paid a fee to partially sponsor this film but it is a long-form commercial for American Airlines elite frequent flyer awards program which bestows unique privileges to a select group of travellers.

The screenplay by Sheldon Turner and director Jason Reitman was adapted from the 2001 novel by Walter Kirn. It should be studied by screenwriting students at cinema schools because it is a rare example of honestly addressing difficult issues such as job loss and life without love. And, Jason Reitman should be applauded for honestly presenting the devestating effects of economic collapse while simultaneously entertaining us. It is both rare and rewarding to see documentary film seamlessly interwoven in a fictional story. Instead of resorting to token cliches, Reitman gives us real victims expressing their rage and anguish after losing long-time jobs.

This film is a tribute to great writing, acting, directing and producing. It successfully embraces comedy and tragedy and is truly enjoyable to watch.",1293148800,29,3239,5.229287090558767

That's the basic premise, but this film is much more than that. It also focuses on his lifestyle: living out of a suitcase, with a practically unfurnished apartment that he ""visits"" only a few days a year, and no significant relationships to speak of. Both his professional and personal lives take drastic turns, and that is really what makes this movie appealing.

As the box office indicated last year, many people are looking to see ""escapism"" movies, ones that make them forget their problems. Then comes Up In The Air, the timely movie that offers a first-hand look at a man who's been the enemy to many laid off employees over the past two years--the man who does the dirty work your boss didn't want to-- by handing you your walking papers in a professional, succinct way.
Now before you write this movie off, picture this: Ryan Bingham (played by George Clooney) travels 275 days in the year across the country to give thousands of people some of the worst news of their lives--that they've been let go. He has no real home, unless you call the friendly skies his home, he's completely alienated from relationships (friendly or otherwise), and he's perfectly fine with that. No arguments about who's going to pick up the kids from school, no complaints about spending too much time away from home, no hassle about forgetting someone's birthday. No strings attached. And as long as folks are getting laid off by the thousands, Bingham will always be employed and continue to keep his coveted lifestyle...until the day the game as he knows it changes and his life presents a whole new meaning to him. The rules of his professional and personal life are turned around and he's left feeling lost, alone, and--worst of all--vulnerable.
Up In The Air isn't necessarily designed to make you feel sympathetic toward the bad guy, but rather presents the other side of the recession, a side you may be more familiar with than you think. At the end of the day, Up In The Air makes us think about the importance of having someone to come home to and how we define ourselves on the job.",1291852800,,1881,4.651651651651652
3995887,4,B002VECMB8,"This is the story of a professional corporate down-sizer who spends his life in airports, hotels and rental cars and thrives on every minute of it. Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney underpins his career with a life philosophy of personal, emotional and material minimalism - the ""empty back pack"" approach as he calls it. The less baggage, the more freedom. The more freedom, the more control. But then we see Ryan learn that freedom might not be all its cracked up to be when his carefully crafted world suddenly starts to unravel under encroaching technology, and a creeping attachment to a fellow road warrior played by Vera Farmiga. This unmasking of Ryan's life is furthered by a persistent challenge to his philosophies from his idealistic and ambitious young protegee played by Anna Kendrick. What Ryan finds out is that frequent flier miles, preferred customer cards and hotel soap can fill up a back back just the same as kids and mortgages. Everything comes at a price.

This is a wonderfully sophisticated movie for adults.  It never drags or gets bogged down with pretentious self examination or over directing (the NYU-film-school pitfalls I hate so much). This is a very watchable movie that simply tells a story. George Clooney maintains his high standards and Vera Farmiga gives this movie a real genuineness.

My only real criticism of this movie is the inclusion of real life monologues from actual downsizing victims, tossed in throughout the movie. These segments jarred my suspension of disbelief and were simply distracting.  There's no question that losing a job is viscerally traumatizing, but business is business people. It's a cold, cold world. Listening to people ask someone who's simply delivering a message, how they can ""sleep at night"" or ""live with themselves"" comes across as effected and melodramatic. A non-actor re-creating an actual moment by, essentially, acting (and doing it badly)pulled the movie down and interfered with the steady pace of the story.

It's set in the turbulent times of office layoffs during the recession. George Clooney is cast as the hatchet man and he really loves his job.  He travels all the time and doesn't even have his own apartment because he's always in the air.  He loves this life he leads which consists of airports, fancy hotels, and occasional one night stands. We see him in an amorous adventure with Vera Farmiga.  She's also a high-powered executive who flies all the time and they meet for torrid couplings whenever they can. Suddenly things change.  Technology has entered the business and his boss wants to make these formerly face-to-face firings through computer screens. He's hired a hotshot aggressive young woman, Anna Kendrick, to manage this.  Clooney complains against this but his boss sends the young woman on a trip with him to test out this new system.

Naturally they are complications.  Some of them are the sad responses of the people being fired.  Another is how the presence of this young woman effects the relationship between Clooney and Famrmiga.  Some of this is outrageously funny and I found myself laughing out loud.  And other parts brought tears to my eyes as the people being fired watched their lives collapse.  And then there is Clooney's family, who is hosting a wedding for his niece.

All of this seemed very real.  The film moves fast and includes trials and tribulations as well s some high comic moments.  And then, just when I thought I knew how the film would end, there was a real surprise zinger which changed everything.

About 'Up In the Air': rarely has a film so incisively and painfully captured the spirit of the moment - mass layoffs, soulless firings, disconnected and transient lives.  Welcome to Corporate America, recession, jobless recoveries, the threat of double-dip recession and the possibility of more of the same over a long term.  Reitman's film nails the fallout from all that.  His coup is that interspersed amongst the scripted drama are interviews with real laid-off workers.  You can tell when these pop up in the narrative - there is real, palpable fear, anger and disappointment voiced to which no scripted work could do justice.  Reitman juxtaposes those pieces with the production line-like layoff work conducted by the characters portrayed by George Clooney, Anna Kendrick and Jason Bateman.  It's great film-making that serves to shake the heart and confidence of any working viewer.

There's also some nice work here in smaller roles by the always good J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis and - in a slightly bigger role - Danny McBride as Clooney's character's soon-to-be (or maybe not-to-be) brother-in-law.

3995891,5,B002VECMB8,"In a wrecked economy at least one industry seems to be thriving:  the sacking folks industry.  In this interesting field of endeavor we find spineless, litigious-leery employers turning to third-party entities to perform the firings for them.  Thus we have the bizarre premise of an excellent film, UP IN THE AIR, the adventures of corporate head chopper Ryan Bingham (an aloof George Clooney) as he travels the U.S., suavely and swiftly terminating workers--all while rapidly approaching the coveted Ten Million Mile Membership.  Accordingly, Ryan is barely home 40 nights a year. . .until his superior (Jason Bateman is priceless) calls him back to corporate headquarters, as the technology is now in place to fire via streaming live video.  Alas, Ryan is grounded.

Or so we thought.  The inspiration for the web cam terminations, young, gung-ho Natalie (Anna Kendrick), needs valuable experience in the field, so Ryan takes her under his wing and off they go to the airport, where Ryan tutors his protege on the fine art of streamlining travel.  And as they go, from city to city, Ryan hooks up with his female alter ego, Alex (a sizzling Vera Farmiga), while Natalie discovers she's just not cut out for the stark brutality of shattering a human being's life.  These interactions of the various characters furnish the charm of this film; they're not only infinitely interesting--they're very, very believable.  There are several termination scenes, some of them humorous, some of them disturbing, all of them compelling.

Yet the beauty of UP IN THE AIR is its delicious irony.  Ryan, so proud of his fierce independence and reliance on nothing but a departure board, finds himself falling in love.  Yet the emptiness of his life resonates when Alex can't return the love (she has a family of her own); thus Ryan, on the side a motivational speaker, no longer believes the nonsense he preaches (jettison all the burdens of your life); he realizes he's trapped in the life he so meticulously created.  (As the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for.)  Accordingly there is an element of angst as UP IN THE AIR concludes, yet aren't there aspects of life much the same?  Besides, Clooney, Farmiga, Bateman, Kendrick, and the rest of a very diverse, ensemble cast make for some very spirited movie watching.  Wrecked economy or no.

Probably the best performance of which George Clooney is capable.  Clooney's character is a highly successful executive leading a rootless life devoid of meaningful human contact, whose job is to inflict pain in the form of job termination, and whose other human contacts are a series of commercial transactions or acts of shallow self-gratification.  Like the anonymous protagonist of The Stranger, Clooney's character is a counter-example of a meaningful life should be.  In some ways, this is a fairly clever construction, using some of the romantic comedy conventions in a mildly subsersive manner.  Unlike The Stranger, where Camus remorsely drives the protagonist's lack of humanity to its logical conclusion with murder and execution, Up in The Air flinches by punishing Clooney's character for attempting to break out of his cul de sac.

3995894,3,B002VECMB8,"I'm starting to catch up on watching recent movies and one of those movies that I've wanted to see from 2009 is Up In The Air (2009) starring George Clooney and Vera Farmiga.  Director Jason Reitman, son of Director Ivan Reitman, has crafted a great feature film for only his 3rd effort as a director.  Up In The Air was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and deservedly belonged with that group of films.  Having now seen 3 of the nominated Best Picture films (Avatar, The Hurt Locker and Up In The Air), I still feel that The Hurt Locker (2008) was probably the best of the bunch.  Although Up In The Air is a close second to me.  Clooney and Farmiga are brilliant in their acting and the writing by Jason Reitman is top notch.  I've heard Reitman say that he is most interested in dialogue in movies, and the dialogue in Up In The Air is witty and interesting.  I fell in love with Vera Farmiga as an actress when she starred in a little USA TV Show called Touching Evil (2004).  The show didn't even last a full season before getting canceled, even though it was excellent IMO.  And Farmiga, along with Jeffrey Donovan, were what made that show so appealing.  They had great chemistry, as Farmiga seems to bring to all her roles.  Of course George Clooney brings his A-game to his role as Ryan Bingham as well.

While listening to a podcast discussion with writer/director Jason Reitman, he mentioned that what this movie is really about is this one man's journey and quest to answer the question of whether he wants to share his existence in this universe with someone.  I think the question and the answer(s) that he uncovers are perfect and I found myself very easily relating to Ryan Bingham. I think Bingham's journey through his life has been so similar to what many of us (men and women) go through in our modern culture.  We get easily wrapped up in our quest to achieve some goal, often in our career, and we lose sight of enjoying the journey to that goal.  And by the time we reach that goal, we find it less satisfying than we expected.  It's this realization that I've had for myself recently with my career, having reached the point I was striving to get to for so many years, and then being thoroughly disappointed in that achievement...especially because I didn't have anyone I wanted with me to enjoy it with.

As an adult drama, Up In The Air is a satisfying film and I wish more movies were made at this quality level.  The cinematography and production design are brilliant on the movie.  I must say one of my favorite set designs was a condo Clooney's character buys...but it only happens in the deleted scenes on the DVD, so it's missing from the actual film.  But that condo is very cool architecturally and I wish it was in the film...but thank god for DVD extras!",1286236800,3,2792,4.4694280078895465
3995895,3,B002VECMB8,"George Clooney is one of People magazine's most photographed ""older"" men, meaning ""older"" women want to see him which is among the reasons he is sought out for films like this one: a dramedy with a handsome leading actor who thinks he knows himself, finds out life is about more than he thinks it is, tries to reconcile this new knowledge to his new goals, and finds out he's trapped in the life he's made for himself. This is all very nice, of course, and it fooled a lot of critics that haven't seen many movies into believing it was unique to this film even though Frederick March played the role more wisely and with greater commitment in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-in-the-Gray-Flannel-Suit/dp/B0009NZ2OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a>&nbsp;more than a half-century ago.

Still, there is plenty to like about ""Up In the Air,"" not least of which is Clooney's characterization of a corporate head chopper -- the opposite of what used to be called a headhunter (someone that recruits candidates for open jobs.) In this role, Clooney plays the head chopper -- someone that goes around and tells people they are fired. The script says Clooney does this, ""because companies are too chicken s--t to do it themselves.""

That's disingenuous, of course. My wife was canned by a Fortune 500 corporation directly, not through a head chopper. She was called to personnel at 3 p.m. one day, told her job was eliminated and she was not being offered another in the company, that someone would get her coat, she should leave the building accompanied by company guards, and her personal belongings would be mailed to her.

In ""Up In the Air,"" once Clooney delivers the bad news, people were allowed to hang around their office the rest of the day. In real life, people would tear up the place, spew virtriol to their soon-to-be ex-coworkers, and use their computers to download viruses to wreck their company's operating system under such circumstances. But, I recall saying there were things to like about this movie...

Those include the film's second subject, Clooney's romance with another head chopper played by  Vera Farmiga (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000M341QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quid-Pro-Quo/dp/B000OU5NLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quid Pro Quo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-in-the-Time-of-Money/dp/B0000D9PNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love in the Time of Money</a>), who plays his female alter ego. In one scene they compare their travel and hospitality cards, a sad view into their lonely and empty lives spent on the road, in hotels, and in coporate backrooms telling people their careers are either dead, dying, or on life support, but a scene that seems on the surface to be one of happiness and fulfillment.

The pair have an affair, of course, and, in a later incomprehensibly dumb sequence at Clooney's sister's wedding -- where he takes the object of his affair as a date -- Clooney's life objective suddenly turns 180 degrees. He then bolts, revolts, tries to relent, and calls on Farmiga to be his soulmate. This episode is full of heartbreak and predictability, but so is much of the movie.

The main attraction of ""Up In the Air"" is the starry and beautiful leads, the breezy script that moves quickly from scene to scene, and the scenes where Clooney and Farmiga interact. Take away these elements and you have a fairly bland film about some aspects of corporate life in the post-2008 stock, auto, financial and employment markets' meltdown and its affect on the employees of those industries.

Just as Michael Douglas played the angry American who lost his job in the 1991-92 recession in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Falling-Down/dp/0790742780/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Falling Down</a>, George Clooney here represents the decaying infrastructure of America's coporations in the post-meltdown era.

It could work as a cute romance between Vera and George's character and it would be better than most such comedies today, or it could be a slam against corporate America, or a character study about the road not taken (and believe it or not, I like the road George's character took, like the poem. I also want that to be the meaning of the movie; but then again, on more than one occasion, I've been told I think too much). Reitman has the same problem in Juno, and the conflict seems to be deciding how to survive modern life, another theme in this movie. If the great soundtrack tells us the meaning, it's to have compassion for the overconfident, the undecided, the stereotype.

3995903,5,B002VECMB8,"""UP IN THE AIR"" is the film equitant of a large helping of ""sweet and sour pork"" - the points and counter-points of the story are symmetrically offset in so many interesting and surprising ways.

The self imposed, seeming simplistic and semi-nomadic life style of the central character Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) may well be the personification of the detachment of the later 20th century, when offered in directed juxtaposition to all of the other characters.  The cold deliberateness of a skilled surgeon allows Bingham to execute his assignments without any concern for the pain his actions cause.  A curious irony plays out when Bingham is effectively ""hoisted with his own petard"" as he is made obsolete by his employer's deployment of technology at the same time that he is attempting to ""settle down"".

I can't watch this film and not recall when I was fired from my job after many years of service.  While I re-live the hurt, anger and betrayal as it is expressed on screen (coincidentally by actual unemployed people - not actors - who were recruited for the film production); I endorse another point of the film, that: termination can be a ""rebirth"" on both a personal and profession levels by providing a change in perspective and a freedom of expression which is often restricted by the standardization of the work environment.

The poignancy of the story may lose its edge, as the economy of 2009 improves - but the central theme of the story is a morality tail of modern life, and will continue to offer inspiration.",1283817600,,1533,4.8320610687022905

I love this movie because it asks us to consider that happiness is personal, not cookie-cutter.  The protagonist loves his life of traveling and the lack of ties that go along with it. Some might see this as melancholy, and at times it is portrayed that way in the movie, but overall, it's clear that what most people want is not what the protagonist wants.

3995910,4,B002VECMB8,"A perfect story of the high-flying life led by Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) who is a corporate hatchet man, responsible for making sure that employee terminations go nice and smoothly. For all the brutality of his role, Bingham has found a way to give fired workers the dignity they need to leave their old, familiar jobs. For this talent, he is highly prized...and compensated. His lofty lifestyle is laid out wonderfully - he wears the finest suits, he knows the best restaurants, hotels and credit cards, and commands the best service. When, on one of his trips, he meets Vera Farmiga (Alex Goran) whose passion and knowledge of the good life matches his own, it seems like a match made in the heavens.

The wonderful thing about ""Up in the Air"" is that it doesn't follow any of the clichd plotlines that could have emerge from this situation. For one thing, Clooney is saddled with a rcent business school grad who wants to replace him with a computerized script. The tension between technologized youth and wisdom and humanity is priceless and timely. It's hard to discuss the movie without giving the story away. Suffice it to say that nothing is what it seems, and turbulence is a certainty.

3995913,4,B002VECMB8,"Entertaining, intelligently-made film with dead-on metaphors for the commitment-phobic and economic uncertainty. George Clooney is perfect casting as Ryan Bingham and the filmmakers did an excellent job in milking the film's ironies and metaphors. Bingham, a road warrior, thrives on constant travel and change while having, at his core, a steady job, a luxury compared to the people who, unlike him, rarely travel, have settled down into a steady home and desk job, and get fired for their efforts. No wonder he seems a little smug and superior to them even while he fires them. The irony, of course, is that he too is expendable, and when young whippersnapper Anna Kendrick shows up, it's his turn to defend his ""traditional"" way of working before teleconferencing gets him laid off. While this plot twist may sound contrived, it's done plausibly and very amusingly, as played by Clooney and Kendrick. Clooney is forced to take on the task of showing her why technology can't replace the task of firing people in person (ironic, since the laid off people are possibly victims of outsourced technology) by emphasizing his talent for ""empathy"". This is supposed to be ironic, since we're supposed to believe Clooney is impersonal and not that given to empathy anyway.

He ends up being a hypocrite again when his sister's fiance chickens out at the wedding and he's forced to give a convincing speech about why marriage is good. So Clooney has to play devil's advocate twice, voicing opinions that are the exact opposite of his nature. All of this is very brillantly laid out and entertaining.

So what's the problem? I think the film doesn't do a good job of showing how nasty, distant and impersonal Bingham is. Clooney is too likable and charming in the beginning, when he should have been the opposite - like Tom Cruise in ""Jerry Maguire"". Cruise was so irritating and annoying I wanted to dump the film halfway - that's what Clooney lacks, the ability to be truly creepy and repulsive. He seems humane and even kind to the laid off workers, so that when he finally shows Kendrick the ropes, I never felt he was acting just to prove something to her. Thus Clooney's ""transformation"" is never wholly convincing - he's not a guy you love to hate, just a guy who's a little lost and misguided. This throws the film off the tracks - you can't rejoice over his final ephinany (that his life is lonely) because he didn't seem that distant from that insight in the first place.

What a pity. This could have been a great film, but as it is, I can really watch it and enjoy it, but regret there's something missing.",1278892800,,2611,4.746696035242291

It makes a statement about following your dreams, family, and goals as Clooney's words somehow always come back to haunt him. I had to laugh at loud when Sam Elliot came back to talk to Clooney about joining the 10 million mile club. Shades of ""The Big Lebowski."" I kept expecting him to call George ""dude"" and tell him he was his father. The movie is bittersweet at times and sad at others, although not a tear jerker. I was confused about his occupation. He is paid to come into an industry and tell the workers they are laid off. Doesn't HR fire people? Do they really hire an outside company to do that? The irony of a man who fires people for a living speaking at a conference called ""Goalquest"" is a bit Orwellian. The best line in the movie was during a firing that he allowed his young assistant to do. She got into trouble, so Clooney the master ax man, steps in and says, ""Do you know why kids love ball players?"" The old man says ""Because the make a lot of money and have sex with beautiful women."" Clooney responds, ""No, that is why we love them. The reason why kids love them is because they followed their dream.""

3995916,5,B002VECMB8,"During this last generation or so, it has been common for employees to have to travel extensively for their jobs, but usually not to the extent that Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) does in ""Up in the Air.""  Ryan's job is anything but stress-free, either, as he has to fire people for a living in a very tough economy--he is hired to do so by firms that do not want to fire their employees themselves.

Ryan leads a solitary life, but in the course of his travels he meets and takes an interest in hottie Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), a fellow road-warrior, and also meets Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young employee in his company who suggests changes that, if implemented, would radically change his job duties and lifestyle.

In the course of the film, the issue of commitment, and how each of the three deals with it, surfaces.  Ryan states that he doesn't see many stable marriages, but he has no close family ties, no rich friendships, no absorbing and stimulating hobbies, no intellectual pursuits, and no acts of community service--nothing that would make an unmarried life fulfilling and rewarding.  When he is not working, he just rides on airplanes--period.  There is a difference as wide as the Mississippi between him avoiding what he sees as unwise or unhealthy commitments and simply damning existence altogether.  He does start to have feelings for Alex, and the viewer does ultimately see whether his dealings with Alex reinforce or dispel his reluctance to commit.

The movie is rated R for adult content, but this is a movie that most children would not be drawn to anyway, as it is for mature audiences.  Even if you are not a big film buff, don't miss this one.  Since the film examines the issues of commitment and economic dislocation, ""Up in the Air"" might be seen decades from now as being emblematic of the late Aughts and early Teens.

And most broadly, the movie portrays the important lesson that, in our quest for meaningful lives, human relationships may be the best we can do.

But I was bothered by a few things, so I have to drop my rating to 4 stars.  Most prominently, the main character Ryan strikes me as implausible: he's handsome, charismatic, can empathize with the people he lays off, and generally seems mature in many ways, yet he inexplicably goes to extremes to avoid close relationships; also, he likes to be pampered while traveling, yet he tolerates spending his relatively few days at home in a somewhat dumpy little place.  Similarly, I found it implausible to see how Alex, his female counterpart, was clearly sending him signs of romantic interest, yet in the end turned out to supposedly not be interested at all.  Likewise, I found the character of Natalie to be somewhat of a stereotyped cliche.  Last but certainly not least, I didn't find that the portrayal of the people being laid off effectively connected me with the distinct pain they must have felt at that moment.

3995924,3,B002VECMB8,"On the face of it, I get why George Clooney is a Huge Movie Star.  It goes without saying just exactly why Gorgeous George is, well, gorgeous.  Clooney exudes that kind of Old Hollywood glamour and masculine charisma of manly-men actors of eras past.  There is even something very reminiscent of Cary Grant in that famous Batman jaw line and the insouciant way that George wears his clothes.  The man is a bona fide Movie Star, creating massive red carpet excitement wherever he goes.  And yet, despite all of George's considerable charms, his film work leaves me absolutely cold and reluctant to put him in the top drawer of American actors.  Somehow I can't shake the inescapable feeling that what we see of Clooney is exactly all there is to get, and that for all of his box-office charisma, George is a very limited actor, with a stock-in-trade of essentially one persona.  It seems like when I go to a Clooney picture, I am getting the same variation on a theme over and over again.  Clooney can't stop playing Doug Ross, the maverick pediatric surgeon that made Clooney a star on ""ER""--except that on the small screen, it worked.  Doug Ross was a great creation, a character for the ages, and it could be argued that the show suffered a fatal blow that it never quite recovered from when Clooney hung up his scrubs.  Was Doug Ross simply an extension of Clooney, the man, and that's why the two blended effortlessly into one another?  Maybe.  But George plays all of his big-screen characters more or less like extensions of himself, too, which gives each of his roles an odd feeling of dj vu.  Clooney is a Big Name in Hollywood, and it's a marquee name, with the chops to open a picture and open it big.  But Big Name is not synonymous with Big Talent, alas.  George is kind of like a male Sandra Bullock, who, recent Oscar win notwithstanding, is a Movie Star for the same reason that Clooney is: she looks good and can be relied upon to deliver the same likeable performance again and again playing essentially a variation on her own likeable down-home self.

I could be confusing the man with a carefully-constructed faade, I suppose.  If so, what an elegant faade it is!  Even Cary Grant once said, famously: ""Even I wish I were Cary Grant.""  Does George ever wake up wishing that he, too, could be George Clooney?  There was one time I can recall that George bucked the `Clooney' persona and gave a surprising and hilarious screen performance, in ""O Brother Where Art Thou?'  That is, sadly, the only Clooney performance I ever wholeheartedly enjoyed, because it was the only performance I know of where George stopped being a brand long enough to actually, well, ACT.

Which brings us the long way `round to the most recent addition to the Clooney canon, ""Up in the Air"".  I finally screened this in the full knowledge that no way could it be as fantastic as all the praise heaped on it at awards time.  It wasn't.  But it is a case of art imitating life to such a degree that it is spooky.  This role of the high-flying corporate `facilitator of redundancies' is such a perfect meshing of the Clooney persona with a role that it HAD to be created just for George by director/screenwriter Jason Reitman.  I wonder if Mr. Clooney ever, in a few moments of solitude, reflected just how much this character is like himself, and whether that gave him any sort of pause.  After all, Mr. Clooney, like his character, is a dedicated bachelor in his late 40s who, until very recently, never finished out a calendar year with the same girlfriend on his arm.  Like his character, Mr. Clooney must enjoy exhaustive air travel, owning as he does a villa in Lake Cuomo, Italy.  George is living a life that is the envy of every ticket-buying man in the world right now, but one wonders if, in those quiet moments George ever asks himself if an enviable lifestyle passes for a meaningful life.  I wonder.  The realization that it isn't is one that his character, Ryan Bingham, comes to, tardily, but he's been so glib during the proceeding hour-plus, it's hard to sympathize.  Clooney seems destined to have slights and arrows just roll off his back, even when he tries to emote the angst of a less successful man.  The suave Clooney facade doesn't extend to projecting emotional gravitas.

They say that great acting is that in which the heavy lifting never shows.  George makes it look so very easy, that by that definition, he should be one of our greatest actors of all time.  But I think he's not so much skillfully hiding the seams of his craft as there's no `there' there to show.  I could be very wrong.  He could actually belong in the `minimalist' school of acting exemplified by the likes of Cary Grant, Robert Redford or another current practitioner, Clive Owen.  But I doubt it.  I think we have allowed ourselves to become so distracted by Gorgeous George's window-dressing that we have lost sight of he fact that for all his pleasing physical proportions, he is not an actor of heft.  Even Brad Pitt, for whom things have often seemed to come too easily onscreen as well has given us some interesting efforts that buck his Hollywood hunk stereotype.  Gorgeous George seems quite content to exist at the Hollywood hunk level.  And why not, when the payday is so great and he has been endowed by his Creator with the genes for hunkdom?  Why work harder than you have to?  When you look like George, that seems like a no-brainer.  Too bad they couldn't somehow bottle ""Eau de Clooney"" so we could all at least smell a little bit like George.",1275868800,4,5553,4.585192697768763

3995928,4,B002VECMB8,"""Up in The Air"" is a film that is both a character study and a love story.  This film examines the persona of a man tasked  to perform actions that put him at the center of situations where people respond with anger and pain.  Than same man, a confirmed bachelor set in his ways, encounters a woman who is his match.

The primary  theme of ""Up in the Air"" is about helping people adjust to the reality that our poor economy may hurt them.  Companies need to downsize or go bankrupt.  But executives in the companies do not like to fire people.  So in comes Ryan Bingham played by George Clooney, who performs two services.  First he fires the people with style and grace, and listens to their rage.  Second he counsels each person, presents him with severance package that includes  transition training and a job placement service.  George Clooney is perfect for this part.  George's personality, his charm, and interpersonal skills, shine as Ryan carefully and tactfully handles each person he counsels.

To perform his marvels, Ryan must travel.  He is constantly on the road.  Accordingly he becomes an expert at efficient travel.  At each airport, hotel, and rental agency, he is a known commodity.  He is efficient and loves his job.

Ryan has determined that he does not wish what other people crave - family, permanent home and family.  He is the penultimate bachelor who thinks he loves the single life.  He cherishes his freedom and limits his goals to accruing  ten million travel points, and become one of a rare few to attain such a distinction.
On one of his trips Ryan meets Alex (played by Vera Farmiga) who also travels most of her life.  Ryan and Alex develop a relationship that becomes a vital subplot of the film.  As Ryan starts to like Alex he begins to question his life style decisions, which leads to more excitement for the story.

I recommend ""Up in the Air"".  It is an entertaining film with an interesting story and  characterization.",1275264000,2,1963,4.680351906158358
3995929,5,B002VECMB8,"In a perfect world we wouldn't need undertakers or IRS auditors or for that matter an employment terminator.  In the latter occupation Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) does it so well even if he doesn't particularly like it or dislike it for that matter. To maintain some sense of sanity Ryan engages in casual affairs or keeps a log of his frequent flier miles and takes pride in the comps he's accumulated.  With the current economic climate things couldn't be better for Ryan's field.  Ryan, however, is at a mid-career crisis.  The home office in Omaha wants to keep him off the road by doing internet hook-up firings.  At home in Wisconsin he's reminded of the disconnect with his own roots and family.  At this crossroad Ryan has some serious choices to make.  I found ""Up in the Air"" to be a piece with director Jason Reitman's earlier effort ""Thank You For Smoking"" in that Reitman challenges the audience to sympathize with a central character with an unsavory occupation.  George Clooney is excellent in suggesting the complexities of Ryan.  The real find here is Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener, Ryan's Ivy League protogee.  Natalie could have come off as an automaton but Kendrick mines the humanity and humor of the character.  Vera Fermiga is alright but essentially her character is the standard girlfriend part.  The accolades drawn by the film seem have caused a negative reaction among some viewers.  Divorce it from the hype you will find it is an excellent film.",1274918400,4,1479,4.844621513944223

3995931,3,B002VECMB8,"I get the movie but I don't get the gushing critical praise and the slew of award nominations. It's a good movie. It's nice to see a studio film that feels small-- basically a three character play only with big scenery. I guess what resonated with critics and the film peers who nominate awards contenders is the idea that American society is encouraging us to pull away from each other-- that human isolation is becoming the norm.  Maybe that's because movie critics and showbiz insiders get to fly around a lot and are constantly uprooted-- maybe blissfully so. They may look at me as I go to the same workplace day after day then come back to my little home in the suburbs and consider it the ideal of social stability and support.  But golly, they sure don't opt for it, even though they can. On the other hand, the rest of us can't try their lifestyles even though we may dream. This movie might represent those people as they look at my grass like its greener. They want us to experience their solitary pain. This movie just doesn't emotionally touch the same nerve for me that it does for them.

Not that I don't buy into the film's thesis as I look at my city sprawling away from the notion of community. There does seem to be more disconnection and isolation than ever before. Right now, I am nose-down in a computer when I could be lunching with friends, or taking a daylight walk and interacting with neighbors who are doing the same. However, this movie almost made being anti-social seem like an elegant, viable life-choice. You wouldn't want to give up your Ritz-Carlton VIP card just for having a few relationships, would you? If I had one, I'm not sure I would.",1274572800,,1677,4.509868421052632
3995932,4,B002VECMB8,"Though I originally had no interest in seeing Up in the Air when it first came out, its numerous Oscar nominations made me rethink my point of view and I decided to rent the movie to see if there is finally one George Clooney movie that I liked. I went into this movie thinking that it would be just another Clooney movie that showed how snarky he can be without having any substance. I was greatly surprised!

The plot of the film is very simple, Clooney plays a man whose job it is to fire people. His company is hired by another company that wants to downsize but does not have the heart to let the people go themselves. Instead, Clooney flies in to personally fire each person that the company has decided to let go. While others view his job as rat-like, he honestly enjoys his career. He is not sadistic nor does he take pleasure in people's unemployment, but he loves to constantly be on the road. Clooney's character boasts that he is well on his way to reaching 1 million miles after which he will be given a plaque, a special flyers card, and the chance to have a conversation with a pilot. It is a great achievement for any constant flyer for only 6 other people have ever reached 1 million miles. Because he flies constantly, Clooney has no home and lives out of a residential hotel when he is ""home"". This doesn't bother him though because he enjoys the travel life of different hotels and restaurants each night.

His entire life gets thrown off course when a new college graduate is hired by his company and she develops a way to do their work remotely. Instead of flying to each agency to lay off people in person, she has created Skype-like software that allows Clooney's company to fire people from their desk at the home office. Before this program can be implemented, Clooney challenges the young woman to join him on the road so she can see how difficult and sensitive his work is. Their time together is touching and humorous in a completely sincere and not cliched way.

While on his travels, Clooney meets his female counter-part in Vera Farmiga. Though both have sworn that they will never marry and only enjoy having a relationship when they are in the same hotel, Clooney starts to think about giving up his traveling life and settling down. Of course, none of these female relationships are what they seem and nothing goes according in plan.

I thought that this movie was incredibly interesting and quite tender without being sappy or annoying. I had an inkling where the film was going to take me but I still enjoyed ""the ride"". In this struggling economy and extremely high unemployment rates, I found this movie to be incredibly timely and poignant. I enjoyed Clooney's character as well as his acting which is something that I have been unable to say in the past. The female supporting roles were equally powerful and I was very impressed by Anna Kendrick's performance. Though some viewers thought that it lagged at times, I disagree with that perception. Some parts were certainly not as dramatic at others, but I completely enjoyed the entire film and highly recommend it!",1274313600,,3108,4.6148282097649185

3995934,4,B002VECMB8,"Great film. Deserving of the Certified Fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes (which means MOST people who know what they're talking about regarding films think it was good.) I hadn't heard the idea of hiring an outside agency to do one's firing before this film. Seems more expensive than needed. Anyway, a simple but relatable story and wonderfully cast. I didn't think Clooney's character evolved as much as he could have, but he obviously did evolve (which you see at the end.) Some people who watch the film may miss the subtleness in which his character grows (the visual portrayal of the evolution is explained in the commentary, which is definitely worth watching/listening to.) And to say that the movie is boring is to also miss the subtleness of the development of the story/characters. One final thought: I think anyone of my generation (Gen X) and certainly later could easily see a future in which we get fired in this manner (in the end when Natalie is showing Ryan the, eh, call center.) Film score 4.25 out of 5.

Overall, the DVD is excellent. For a short second, I kind of wished there was a separate extras disc, but then I realized there didn't need to be. They have the teaser trailer as well as theatrical trailer (at minimum the DVD should have the theatrical trailer.) There is a short featurette ""Shadowplay: Before the Story"" that's about the company that did the opening titles (which were very well done.) The deleted scenes are probably worth the rental by themselves (if you saw this movie in theaters.) There is an extended sequence called ""Omaha Montage"" that is very good and quite interesting as it poses a kind of alternate leading-up-to-the ending. I understand why this sequence was cut (time and pacing of the film) and I agree, but I think it really works to show how much Ryan has evolved. Again, the commentary is very good, but I kind of felt like they would get a bit off track in comparison to what was going on on screen. DVD score 4.

we are to show sympathy for someone who makes a living at firing people, who has to travel thousands of lonely miles, stay in cheap hotels and deals with airport security issues. we hear the stories of the unemployed, but it's the 'firing' contractor who must deal with their emotional ups and downs. it's the contractor who must quietly accept the fact that he is employed, when others are not.

Interesting premises to work with-business travel, relationships on the road, making a successful career out of firing others - but the supporting cast and editing really get in the way.

3995940,5,B002VECMB8,"Not a feel-good movie, but an ironic one about people that have come up with a philosophy to minimize engagement with the human element of their lives.

George Clooney's character; Ryan Bingham, has come up with a personal philosophy that sterilizes his life. He travels with the sparest of luggage and has streamlined his routine for the ultimate efficiency. He has created a system that works. In fact he teaches a course on his philosophy and it is clear relationships are filed under baggage.

He is a corporate axman, the most heartless of positions. He is the person that is hired in to fire people. He is on the top of his game and thinks he is essential. Ironic considering what he does for a living. Essential or so he thought until a young new hire (Anna Kendrick) in his company thinks she can out efficient him and take it up another step to virtual firing. In a bid to show just how essential firing done live is (to keep him on the road for his frequent flyer miles), this ax man, offers to show her the ropes, on why his way is better.

On the way, he meets Alex (Vera Farminga), a similarly-minded woman, with the same philosophy that he has and they forge an alliance, of non-involvement.

So as not to provide a spoiler for the movie, I will stop here.

You can see how heartless virtual firing would be, though only a step up from an anonymous person handing you your papers and the movie only too well demonstrates this.
I also found the conversation between the new hire in her 20s on working and relationships with Alex, clearly a woman in her 40s enlightening. Do young women think they are letting older women down, when they don't put their jobs first?

I felt the acting was very well done. George Clooney was on top of his game as the polished confident (and somewhat cocky) executive. Alex (Vera Farminga) had a similar polish with a  warmer edge and the new hire (Anna Kendrick) was clearly on her way. Her acting was wonderful and clearly captured all the emotions of this experience.

While I'm not normally prone to lavish praise on George Clooney, after seeing his performance I would be hard pressed to cast another in the role of Ryan Bingham.  He is confident without being smug with a disarming charm mild enough to keep from raising undue suspicion.  And, curiously enough, he is genuinely careful to break the bad news to the soon-to-be-unemployed as painlessly as possible with their pride not only intact but even bolstered.

The rising drama of the story comes when a very bright and even more ambitious young graduate proposes a means of completely streamlining the human element of what Ryan Bingham does in favor of a computer screen and a T-1 connection to the Internet.  It's difficult to say whether it is understandable or ironic that Bingham would take such offense to the notion, but he is certainly offended!  His punishment for not keeping that opionion to himself?  He gets to personally train the young woman who made the proposal for virtual firing.  At first, he is incredulous but he quickly realizes that this is really the best way to make his point and make it stick!

Great premise and great direction, but I do wish some of the same ruthlessness that marked Reitman's first two films was present here as well.  There should have been a menagerie of women with whom Ryan Bingham would cavort before he tried to make things work with one.  And the second to last scene should have been him looking at all of these other women and feeling even more distant from that opposite sex than ever.  That, for me at least, would have made the romantic elements of this story far less formulaic.

But, all in all, this film deserved far more attention that it received.  It should have been a _real_ contender for best picture and not that mindless slop that Cameron was serving!

In the face of the lower ratings others have awarded, I'm giving this one five stars with bells and whistles.

There wasn't a single scene in this film that didn't wholly engross me. As I watched, I kept thinking, good, good, yes, yes... And the plot kept going, and building. There's no doubt in my mind that most of the women I know will hate this film. I hope they'll forgive me (no chance) for saying this, but to me ""Up in the Air"" seemed gut-level honest. Maybe it's because at some level the hero's persona came so close to my own. Whatever the reason, I ached when he dared to hope the American dream might be possible for him.

Is there some element that everyone downrating this one is missing? No. What you're seeing in the statistics is a division of the sexes. They hate it, we love it. In my view, this is an excruciatingly human film and it will be a shame if every guy who sees it doesn't take the time to talk about it a little.

Because, like Bergman's silents, this is one of those films you want to watch a second time, and then a third and then a fourth and at last you finally start to see what's really there.

P.S. Whew! Vera Farmiga is hotter than a two dollar pistol in this one, and George Clooney - who was that elderly actress who had the classic punch line, ""he's no slouch in bed?""

It is a movie about being laid off, so if you have been laid off during this ecconomicly hard time i would think twice about seeing it before you get another job. it CAN be a little on the depressing side if you let it.

George Clooney has the same comic meter that he did in Oceans 11 and i loved that one too. It just doesn't have the great ensamble cast that Ocean's 11 had.

I'd say the romance in this film is more between the main character and his lifestyle, but there is also a short-lived affair for George Clooney's character, Ryan Bingham, with Alex who is played by the lovely, sexy and, at one moment, semi-nude Vera Farmiga. Clooney still looks good and still knows how to trick you into thinking he really is the guy you're watching on the screen. Anna Kendrick was excellent in her role of Natalie. I think she plays the perfect fresh-out-of-college-wants-to-please-everyone-before-herself-hardcore-business-exec-newbie. Her crying scene is hilarious, too, and I especially like the relationship that developed between Kendrick's and Clooney's characters. The thing I like best about this movie is the end; Bingham's last few lines and the way in which they are delivered by Clooney - almost poetic. I also think the title is perfect, and I take it two ways in relation to Clooney's character - He's literally up in the air, and also the things and relationships in his life are how he wants them to be so nothing is really ""up in the air"" in those areas. Ryan Bingham has got his certainty, and I think that's nice. There are probably more meanings to that title, and maybe I'm naive in picking up on those obvious ideas, but that's what I gather for now.

Even though it wouldn't be my career choice, I sort of envy one part of Ryan Bingham's job...the part that includes flying from place to place and never staying put. Of course, after a while that becomes boring and very routine, and I'd want more normalcy on the ground. I think Ryan Bingham's obsession with earning 10-million sky miles and his elite membership card collection sort of pacifies his need for more in a way, and though he eventually does give in to being the guy who does want more of a normal, settled life aka the guy he previously decided not to be, you can somehow predict that he'll return to being that almost non-existent shadow flying overhead. That's where his destiny lies, and, at the end of the film, I was comforted knowing that Bingham was back ""up in the air"" and didn't end up miserable and alone. Yes, he is alone, but I think he's happy. He's happier, at least, for having taken a chance and opened himself up to something new, even if it was just for a short time. What's the old saying? Better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all.",1272240000,,2695,4.671578947368421
3995951,4,B002VECMB8,"Clooney is the movie even though he has a strong supporting cast of two delightful women helping him.  The plot was the boring part from the standpoint that I have never heard of anything resembling his job and job functions even though I had over 30 years of managerial experiences.  He was a convincing ""bumper"" who was lucky he did not have bad things happen to him.  Had it not been for the two supporters this movie would have been a 2 or 3 star at best.  Additionally, throwing in a little bit of sex only addressed the script's weakness.  It was a tad bit much for the writer to attempt making us believe that George was so stupid that he did not know the necessary secrets of his bunkmate.  In fact. it made both of them look stupid but the title should go to the writers.  The music was quite good; however, the sound mixing was mediocre at best.  On a slightly off topic subject, I hope someone can help me by explaining how this standard DVD differs from Blu-Ray disk.",1272153600,2,979,4.34065934065934

3995953,4,B002VECMB8,"First of all- my comment about this movie being a ""Rorschach"" test is in jest: top level, I found it very entertaining and enjoyable.

However, this movie can be a good conversation piece: discussing it with several folks, I was amazed by the diversity of their take on it and some of the unque interpretations. Like a multi-faceted diamond, folks can view it in many ways, and hence, perhaps reflect their own inner state of being.

One thing to highlight: some reviewers pointed out that they saw the ""catch"" coming a mile away and anyone who did not see it must be a PT BARNUM victim (i.e. ""sucker born every minute""). I sincerely did not see it, and when I asked a handful of colleagues who also saw the emovie, they too admitted not seeing the twist coming.

Hmmm....like I said - this movie a ""Rorschach"" test.",1271894400,,816,4.537414965986395
3995954,4,B002VECMB8,"This movie is essentially making the point for family and marriage versus being single and career driven. It is about the sad solitude for someone who has no roots, someone who travels 300 days a year and has no one to come home to. Naturally, the inevitable conclusion and the lesson the main character (Clooney) learns at the end is that none of the success and mileage accumulating (the big goal is to make it into the 10 million mile club for the heck of it) mean anything, if you don't have anyone to share it with, if you don't have anyone to come home to. In this case, we find out that he is actually in an even worse shape than the people he fires, because they all have someone to go home to, someone who will help them get through it, while Clooney's character - despite all the material privileges and looks - doesnt.

The lesson here then is to try to do everything you can to not be alone, which  - according to this movie - is worth than death.

The movie is entertaining and i must say I appreciated the independent feel of it. It wasn't all fake and glammed up and except for Clooney and Farmiga, none of the actors looked like they had jumped out of some  photoshopped Vogue pages. They were real people (which somehow made Clooney be out of place...but that's another story) who felt and looked real. Overall pretty entertaining and fun - if you are not completely and utterly alone.",1271894400,,1402,4.380769230769231
3995955,5,B002VECMB8,"When I first heard about this movie, all I knew was that George Clooney plays a character who spends most of his time traveling. Consequently, I couldn't imagine why it got so much critical acclaim. After seeing it, I agree completely with the acclaim and highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great and interesting drama/comedy. The acting is wonderful, the writing is engaging and witty, and the story is a little unusual.

Ryan Bingham (Clooney) works for a company whose business is informing people they've been fired by their employers. Personally, I didn't know such a business existed, but I can see how some bosses might actually hire other people to do their firing for them. Ryan clearly has been doing his job for many years and while he doesn't enjoy firing people, he knows how to handle it well. The part of his job he actually enjoys is the constant travel; he's only in his own apartment for a few days a year. Then along comes Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who's almost fresh from college and sells the company on the idea of firing people remotely instead of traveling to do it in person. Ryan and Natalie end up traveling together to allow Natalie to see how things are currently done and to test the new system. Natalie developed this new idea without ever being involved personally with firing someone before.

Relationships - and the avoidance of them - are integral to the story. Ryan makes additional money doing speeches on how not to weigh yourself down, an idea which includes keeping some distance from others. He meets Alex, who seems to be his female counterpart in many ways, while traveling and they begin a casual relationship. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Natalie has a boyfriend and cannot understand Ryan's approach to life. It's clear Ryan even keeps his family at a distance when his sister's wedding comes up. Still, he does care for his family and even begins to connect more with Alex, so he asks her along as his guest.

With a story quite unlike his previous success ""Juno"", Jason Reitman has again done a superb job balancing drama and comedy. It even includes a couple of unexpected twists which will leave you thinking. The theme of layoffs is naturally especially relevant today, but the story doesn't get so bogged down as to become too depressing.",1271894400,4,2320,4.737623762376238
3995956,4,B002VECMB8,"George Clooney has a tendency to pick movies with great dialogue and original storylines every year.  In 2009, it paid of with this drama that nabbed a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars.  The story background is about around a man whose professional life is traveling from company to company, where his job is to fire people.  The plot focuses on his life, and how it is complicated by a female colleague who is trying to change how he does his job.  There are numerous surprises throughout the movie, which is anchored by great dialogue from all the characters.  There is some romance, and some comedy.  Overall, a good movie, though I do not think it deserved a Best Picture nomination when other, better movies from 2009, such as Star Trek and Harry Potter, did not get a nod.",1271721600,,783,4.597122302158273
3995957,3,B002VECMB8,"Even with all the Oscar hype for this movie I don't feel I went in with extremely high expectations, yet I was mostly underwhelmed with ""Up In The Air.""

First, I didn't feel the acting was all that great, especially by the leads. Much like Vince Vaughn, I never expect George Clooney to play anyone but George Clooney, and I'm OK with that. And, much like Vince Vaughn, that's going to work 95 percent of the time. But when a director is striving to relay a deeper meaning or explore complex feelings and issues, a guy basically playing himself and mugging for the camera just does not work. Vera Farmiga's role seemingly could have been played by anybody with blond hair (her character is a key character but the actress brings no depth), and Anna Kendrick's role also could have been filled by any actress. The best performances come from Amy Morton as Ryan's sister Kara, J.K. Simmons as one of the firees, Jason Bateman as the boss and even Danny McBride *NOT* hamming it up has a strong presence. Sadly, these roles are basically wasted.

Second, Ryan's transformation is a major point in the movie, yet it feels like its forced or not quite complete. Even when he walks out on his backpack presentation, it feels (to me) that there is still a part of him still questioning the sedentary lifestyle he's avoided.

Third, I never go for forced/easy love interests, but that's what this movie has and that love interest is one major element driving the film. I didn't find the Ryan-Alex relationship to be all that developed or believable.

Also, the ending just seemed a bit off. An ending is just that -- a resolution to a plot or (in a movie like this that doesn't have much of a plot) a character's growth. Neither really happens, and though Ryan does have a bit of an epiphany (which is quickly crushed), the fact there is no reaction to it (that we see, anyway) and the realization that epiphany was bogus kind of makes the previous two hours a bit pointless. The viewer invests all this time and is left with very little to take home. The way I interpreted the ending left me questioning what good it was for Ryan to have his awakening.

Last, there are some run-of-the mill complaints (opening credit music = awful, bland dialogue, the fact much of the movie was a commercial for Hertz, Chrysler and American Airlines) that helped tie the cement shoes to this one.

I didn't think ""Up In The Air"" was awful, yet it struggled to live up to even modest expectations.",1271721600,,2475,4.563063063063063
3995958,5,B002VECMB8,"Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is in the air 322 days a year, flying from one city to another to fire people. Business managers are too cowardly to terminate their employees personally, so they hire they hire the firm Bingham works for to do it for them. Bingham, we are soon convinced, is just plain cold. As fired employees cry, explode in anger or express thoughts of a hopeless future, Bingham sends them on their way to a new life.

 Clooney is simply superb in this role. Charming, though we want to hate him for what he does.

 He is also an isolated man. Ryan Bingham has no attachments. No wife, present or former; no children; just a distant relationship with his sisters. He hates the 43 days a year he has to spend at ""home"", a sparsely furnished, small apartment.

 Again, only a guy like Clooney supported by a brilliant script and direction could handle this rule. If it weren't for Clooney, we'd tune out and walk out quickly.

 The story is carefully constructed. Just as we are about to consign Ryan Bingham to nothingness, he meets a woman at a hotel bar. Alex (Vera Farmiga) is apparently like Ryan: forever on the road, with apparently nothing tying her down. They get very friendly and the scene of them comparing flight schedules to figure out their next liaison is hilarious.

 Ryan is called back to the office. The firm is going to cut costs and adopt new technology by firing people using webcams on the internet, courtesy of a scheme developed by the young college gad Natalie, who is brilliantly played by Anna Kendrick.

 Coming off the road would be a disaster for Ryan: he loves flying from place to place, never being at ""home"". He also has a secret goal, something he desires more than anything.

 Bingham objects to the new plan as being heartless and he is ordered to take Natalie on the road.

 The road trip exposes the arrogant Natalie to real life in more ways than one.

 There is a drive to an end - and I'm not going to tell you what it is.

 But the final third of the film is something of a tour d'force of emotion. It does not end as you might expect it to, but it does conclude in an oddly fascinating, if not satisfying, way.

 If you like extremely well done sophisticated comedy, you owe yourself a viewing of this film. It is truly excellent.

I hope to see more of Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick in the future.  Of course Jason Bateman is always good and I am glad to see him in more films.  George Clooney was fantastic too.  The scene at the end where he stands there and says nothing but watching his facial expressions change was superb acting.  Using out of work people in the scenes was genious.

3995960,4,B002VECMB8,"This movie was only about half as good as I thought it would be.  It came very close to being the equivalent for George Clooney of what ""Jerry Maguire"" was for Tom Cruise.

3995961,1,B002VECMB8,"I read Walter Kirn's book when it came out a couple of years ago; I found it meandering and that the author strained to be quirky and hip.  Kind of like the aging hipster everyone knows who is purposefully outrageous in a desperate attempt to get an increasingly distinterested audience to continue to pay attention. (Chuck Palahniuk, I'm looking at you.) After passing on it at the theater, I succumbed to Oscar hype and just saw the movie on DVD; after all, how could a movie with three acting nominations (George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick) be that bad.  Now that I have seen it, I can safely report that, yes, it is that bad.

My impressions of the movie:

(i) The movie really is character driven, which is to say that inasmuch as it really doesn't have much of a plot to move the movie forward, it relies on engaging audiences in character development rather than plot development (i.e. who the characters ARE, not what the characters DO).  This is not an indictment by itself; some of the best works of fiction are essentially character studies (for example, Catcher in the Rye's Holden Caufield really doesn't do much, the book is about who he is and his conception of the world).  However, if you rely on characters as the tentpoles of your movie, those characters need to be compelling, to have something that makes the audience want to understand them better, to be empathic enough that the audience can relate to thoughts that they themsleves have thought or emotions that approximate what they have felt.  The characters here, as far as I can tell, offer nothing new or interesting.  At the beginning, George Clooney's character's philosophy of non-commitment seemed like it had something novel underneath the surface, but turned out that really it amounted to nothing more than what you can hear from any random freshman frat brother (""I ain't never getting married.  Kids, who needs them?"")  The movie never really explores what is behind his philosophy or how it informs his life. I won't even go into the two lead women's characters; they really were studies in one dimensional caricatures.

(ii) The acting was servicable, but really not in the realm of Oscar-worthiness.  The main character's defining traits are isolated stoicism and detatched coolness.  Clooney does what he always does by playing himself.  I defy anyone to come up with any diferentiating traits between his characters in ER, Oceans 11/12/13, the Peacemaker, Out of Sight, Leatherheads, Intolerable Cruelty, etc.  (I'll give you Syriana and Oh Brother, Where Art Thou).  The point is again, as the movie relies primarily on making this character compelling, the bar is higher than just two hours of Clooney mugging for the camera. Anna Kindrick nomination was questionable, but ultimately justifiable (though I am not sure how hard it is to do uptight career girl). Vera Farmiga's nomination was sheer madness; I am guessing it had more to do with a certain New York Times Magazine article than anything else.

(iii) The movie just makes you feel bad and not in a good way.  I love sad movies and, when earned, will applaud any movie that makes you feel it emotionally.  However, I would put this in a category of manipulative movies which simply trigger external feelings by barfing it onto the screen.  Viewers already feel worried about losing their jobs in this environment and empathize with those who have lost their jobs.  Throwing a bunch of real folks on the screen to showcase the misery of the lowest point of their lives really is not the same as building an interesting and empathetic character or story to engage the audience on an internal level.

******SPOILER******
(iv) I can't really say a lot about the plot as there really is not much there.  Man tries to get 10mm frequent flier miles, succeeds, finds that it's not as rewarding as he expected.  Along the way, he has a relationship with a married woman and tutors a new recruit, who comes to find the world is more complicated than she expected.  That's pretty much it.  Again, this is not meant to be a plot driven movie.
******END OF SPOILER******

Overall, am I glad I saw it?  No, not really.  It really did not give me anything that I have not seen before or anything to think about that has not been covered better in any number of other places.",1271635200,23,4327,4.778225806451613
3995962,3,B002VECMB8,"I think this is where the viewer's own experience will figure in his/her reaction to this rather sad comedy.

On the plus side, the arguments for why losing a good job is one of life's great opportunities are presented for what they are--nonsense, especially in the current job market.  As that ridiculously stereotyped young lady explains how being fired is just a step towards new horizons.  On the minus, there seemed to be a morality tale, as if Clooney was somehow being punished in his private life as comeuppance for what he did for a living.

There is some clever dialog but even here its giving with one hand while taking with the other.  The subtext is that if you're clever and articulate enough you can convince people that the loss of a job, while serious, is likely to be an opportunity.  And frankly, the alternative to Clooney's lifestyle, the young midwestern couple getting married, didn't look all that appealing, either.

No doubt this movie will resonate with a small number of people who ended up better off as the result of a layoff and those are the stories everyone likes to hear.  I worked for a company where everyone lost their job so I have some idea of the probabilities.  But its ironic, don't you think, that if people like Ryan Bingham actually exist, on the one hand, a company could be desperately trying to save money by firing staff while on the other, cover the cost of flying somebody all over the country to do what their own personnel department should do?",1271462400,,1497,4.640151515151516
3995963,4,B002VECMB8,"The sophisticated comedy of manners, which saw its heyday in cinema with the films of Ernst Lubitsch and Howard Hawks, went out of style so long ago that it sometimes seems like a lost art.  As one who appreciates this particular kind of comedy, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that Up in the Air is, in many respects, a comedy of manners in the Howard Hawks vein.

Sure-footed and seasoned professional George Clooney engages in love-duel with his intellectual equal, Hawksian woman Vera Farmiga, while tutoring the equally competent but less experienced Anna Kendrick.  It's all done in rapid-fire banter of the type that was Hawks' comedic trademark.  It makes me wonder if director Jason Reitman was thinking of Hawks when he made this film.

Of course, this film is about unemployment and the Great Recession, so the comedy has to be tinged with a shot of realism, and the story does take a few detours to highlight the superficiality of the main character's lifestyle, but for me Up in the Air was a welcome reminder that Hollywood still appreciates urbane humor.

3995969,5,B002VECMB8,"Think you've got plenty of frequent flyer miles? Wait until you meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burn-After-Reading/dp/B001JIE7JM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burn After Reading</a>), a guy who flies almost nonstop. It's his job that gets him Up in the Air all the time. He travels around the States firing people as humanely as he can. Trouble is, though, is that this job makes him the most detached person alive. No family ties. Not married. No kids. Not even a real home anywhere. Ryan lives out of his carry-ons and knows how to move through airports like grease through a goose.

But things are about to change. His boss Craig (Jason Bateman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokin-Aces/dp/B002VEJKQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokin' Aces</a>) just hired a hot-shot who's idea to tele-fire people remotely (via computer) has the potential to ground Ryan. But he's not giving up without a fight. This new up-and-comer named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has a few thins to learn. So Ryan takes her on the road with him to show her why firing face-to-face has its merits.

Paralleling Ryan is the female version of him; a woman named Alex (Vera Farmiga,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000M5AJQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>) who so mirrors his sentiments that they seemed destined for one another. Sexual sparks fly but their jobs (and flights) keep them apart more often than not. Which initially seems fine for both of them.

As Ryan shows hot-shot Natalie the ropes of how-to and how-not-to fire someone, we learn that Natalie is more brittle than previously believed. A broken relationship with a boyfriend sends her reeling, much to the confusion of Ryan who's never had a serious relationship in his life. ""Everything I own can fit in this backpack. Even my relationships.""

But as Ryan sees his job changing, he also sees his life moving in a different direction. He's headed for a three-way fulcrum. The first is that he might actually need someone. And as he begins to see that not everything fits so neatly into his backpack, his feelings for Alex change his views. The second is that he has a family member who's about to get married, and he finds that seeing a wedding and how people actually enjoy needing one another changes his outlook. And finally we get to his frequent flyer miles. He's about to hit a milestone that only a handful of other people have made it to. Millions upon millions of miles. And as the realization that he's collected all of these miles alone comes to him, he finds that maybe, just maybe, he needs to make a connection ...not a connecting flight but an actual human connection.

It is here that I have to end my summation of the movie and simply say that this isn't going to be some formulaic film where a person finds what they need and everyone lives happily ever after. Life just isn't that cleanly laid out. I applaud writer/director Jason Reitman for having the gumption to not take the road most traveled. Although I saw what was coming for Ryan after he decided to make a change, the impact of it astounded me. Clooney did a great job making us care for a man that we really shouldn't care for. We want to give him a shot at a normal life, but when that option is snatched away, we feel exactly the same way Ryan does: cheated. Even though he's been a complete butthead most of his life.

This is a story with no special effects. No tricks. And it pulls no punches. It's just a great story well-told. I loved it.",1271030400,4,3655,5.1447811447811445

3995975,1,B002VECMB8,"OK. We have Clooney as someone totally cut off from ""normal"" human relations who enjoys being a hired gun firing people. The extra shots of people acting like they've suddenly been yanked out of normality to be sent to a concentration camp only shows the movie-maker's ignorance of white-collar employment. In addition, try firing a minority without an entire series of formal warnings and you will be sued for racism. Anyone working in white collar position knows storm clouds are about to hit. If someone making $90,000 a year doesnt realize their job could end and has not prepared for it doesnt deserve to be making $90,000 a year. 3 months severance pay and being a minority (which would almost guarantee an instant hire at that kind of white-collar level) is hardly the recipe for a character's suicide.

The girl is feisty enough to say ""it's a number"" when Clooney admits his 10 million mile goal, and is also confident in other areas that would make it INCONGRUOUS for us to see her throw down her co-worker's cutout because he doesn't ascribe to her ideas on ""love.""

This writer's block could be seen in Juno as well when the guy who knocks up Juno acts irresponsibly nonchalant while she adores him. The makers of this movie take characters and suddenly place them in incongruous situations simply because they started something they don't know how to finish. We are tested to see if we can sit thru Clooney's sister's wedding, and ""we"" - or should i say ""I"" - simply couldn't. Fast-forward to the credits.

In addition to the absurdity of putting the Company video-hookup on hold, when it proved it worked better, is the depressing ignorance on Clooney's part (altho it's meant to show the opposite)  of putting an uncommitted groom into marriage, almost guaranteeing the failure and phoniness he had criticized earlier in the film.",1270771200,3,1968,4.883233532934132

He likes his work and his life, which is uncomplicated by relationships or domestic demands.  On one stop-over, however, Ryan meets a female version of himself (Vera Farmiga) and sparks fly.

The success of this movie must be due entirely to the charm of its leading man, because it is in no other way unusual or special.  Clooney is indeed quite likable playing a slick smooth-talker while Farmiga is good in an undemanding role, but neither perfromance was  worthy of an Oscar nomination in my opinion.

It gives you a real good look at how impersonal the world we live in is becoming. The plot was fairly intersting as Clooney discovers he wants to put down roots again and tries to build real connections with people. He succeeds in some areas and fails in others.

Clooney plays an executive who goes from city to city(with a heap of flyer miles to boot)and fires people from their jobs. To watch these parts of the movie is sobering to say the very least and then it gets downright impersonal when a new young upstart(Anna Kendrick) brings in an idea to do it via videocam; First of all, it was funky doing it in personal, now it got downright terrible. Quite a sobering movie. Clooney already knows the drill and the job, but he meets a lady(Vera Farmiga), whom he likes because she lives a similar life and feels that perhaps she's the one for him but come to find out she has her own separate life that slaps him in the face. The scene where he is coming from meeting her and he finds out he got the 10 Million Miles points and special pin makes you wonder if that was worth all that he put up with. The young lady that he pairs up with and had the good idea, hits the road because the job gets to HER(imagine that) but all in all, the movie is worth the accolades it deserves. I must also speak on the opening song performed by Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. That alone sets the tone for the movie and is worth you checking out the group on You Tube. I am sorry they didn't get Best Picture but it was worth the nomination it received. One more thing. Jason Reitman, who is the director, is noteworthy and one to watch for because this was his second time coming up for an Oscar and he's pretty much the new kid on the block.",1270512000,,1577,4.140065146579804

3995983,4,B002VECMB8,"Ryan Bingham is close to chalking up a mythical 10 million miles on American Airlines when a perky new executive, Natalie, threatens to take the personal touch out of giving employees the boot by turning it into a web-cam experience.  Bingham is a no-nonsense ""outplacement representative"" who is close to reaching a major frequent-flyer milestone.  He also finds himself wrestling with a cardboard cut-out of his sister and fiance, which they want him to photograph in front of landmarks around the US.  Not to be thwarted from his ""magic number,"" he leads Natalie on a round of outplacements to demonstrate that this is something that can only be done in person.

Clooney has become quite comfortable in this type of role, growing ever more attractive with his gray highlights and open smile.  He seems to have met a good match in Vera Farminga (Alex), who similarly has taken on a pleasant ""weathered"" look, despite being only 36 years old.  The two play off each other like in a Billy Wilder movie.  Social commentary is kept to a minimum, although Natalie feels the brunt of outplacing persons when they are forced to give Detroit autoworkers the heave-ho.

Jason Reitman seems more polished now.  He avoids getting overly sentimental, although there was a point where you thought this movie might go the way of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepless-in-Seattle/dp/B0000AOV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepless in Seattle</a>.

3995984,3,B002VECMB8,"George Clooney has earned his way into the category of trusted actor. It happened on the last feature I saw him in, Michael Clayton. Afterwards, I decided the films he takes on are worthy, period. There are few other actors in this category. Renee Zellwiger, Morgan Freeman, Christopher Walken, Jeff Bridges. The point is, Clooney chooses his projects wisely. Aside from 'Oceans', which he does for camaraderie, Clooney has climbed to the top, several steps above his previous status of 'charismatic with face value'.

'Up In The Air' finds George in the curious role of Ryan Bingham. Employment for Ryan is dependent on the expendibility of fellow professionals. He is a hired gun, who terminates and transitions employees for companies who would rather outsource their blood-letting. Ryan lives comfortably out of a carry-on suitcase. He has mastered the art of transition, thus he is an expert at what he does.

Back at the home office, Ryan's boss (Jason Bateman) has hired a recent firestorm of a grad (Anna Kendrick), who has plans on modernizing the way his company does business. Ryan is tasked with taking her on the road and indoctrinating her into his way of doing things. Along the way, Ryan's latest partner in the mile high club (Vera Farmiga) slowly evolves into something more. Transition is the major theme of 'Up In The Air'. That takes on many contexts in this fine drama fused with romance and comedic splashes.

'Up In The Air' is directed by Jason Reitman, who previously helmed the outstanding 'Juno' and a favorite of mine 'Thank You For Smoking'. Reitman is quite good at dealing with everyday situations coupled with exceptional dialogue. The actors are allowed the latitude to expand their characters while remaining on a smart pace. This occurs when room for expression is granted yet not allowed to linger. This fine line can also be observed in the editing which is very good as well.

As stated Mr. Clooney has elevated his stature, yet his supporting cast is undeniably outstanding. Vera Farmiga is truly wonderful as Mr. Clooney's mirror image throughout. She has a great script to indulge in and appears comfortable matching wits with Clooney. I also thought that Anna Kendrick was perfect for the role and spot on from her first scene to the last. Hers is a new world of a matter of fact 'company man' on the rise. Jason Bateman turns in another fine performance as Clooney's supportive but realistic boss. His previous role in 2009's 'State of Play' saw him scaling new heights as well.

The DVD is available in Blu-ray as well as regular DVD. It plays with a crystal clear picture and sounds great (screened on a Sony BVD-360 with a Samsung 40"" 1080p HD set). Special Features include commentary from the director, Jason Reitman, and deleted scenes.",1270339200,,2786,4.881606765327696

Sometimes the change is so exaggerated that it isn't believable, but, when done right, there *is* always some kind of a change. In this film, I kept rooting for the borderline-unlikeable Ryan Bingham to change in some perceptible way and, though he comes close, that doesn't happen. Also, the ""plot twist' with Alex is too easy to guess.

Clooney is just Clooney (read Danny Ocean) and, although the idea had legs, I don't think the writing was all that clever, provocative, or funny.  Anna Kendrick is the only bright spot in an otherwise somewhat blah picture and the only element of the movie that deserved any nominations this award season.",1270252800,,467,4.614457831325301
3995987,3,B002VECMB8,"George Clooney is very talented and not bad to look at so I generally go to see whatever he's in.  A few of my favorite films are ""Michael Clayton"" and ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"".

Clooney as Ryan Bingham is a  good choice since he can pull off the role of a self centered professional who fire's personnel for a living and still be likable.  Vera Farmiga as Alex was well done too.  Her role seems ordinary as a kind of ""comfortable in her own skin"" and friendly colleague if it weren't for the duel life she leads.  But Anna Kendrick's portrayal of Natalie a ivy leagued go getter with book smarts but no common sense was a much more interesting character to watch albeit an unpleasant personality.  And Jason Bateman always plays a shady fast talker very well.

But my problem with Up In The Air is some parts of it didn't seem to complement other areas.
In the introduction some people didn't seem authentic talking about losing there jobs.  After the fact I can certainly respect private citizens talking about there real terminations.  But in the theater I was thinking wow some of these extras cant act.......

Ryan Bingham's family seemed odd and  frumpy compared to his well dressed, charming and dignified persona.  They also seemed to be mad with him simply because he lives his own life away from the brood.  Ryan's older sister specifically seemed cold, angry and needy.  I really couldn't understand why adults would be furious because a sibling was successful and living on his own?

The whole wedding and Danny McBride's entering the film was confusing since I expected to laugh right away because his comedy is usually delivered with a straight face.  Whenever he was in a scene I couldn't take it seriously because of his smirk.

If the message Up In The Air was trying to convey is to value friends and family the characters in the film that represented that lifestyle were contradictory, selfish and unlikable.  Natalie spoke of wanting to get married and having a family as if it were on one of her flow charts to be checked off like a task.  Alex had a family she was willing to cheat on regularly.  And Ryan's siblings were willing to include him in their life as long as he lived by their rules and geographical boundaries.

Seemed to me Ryan Bingham was the only honest sympathetic person in the film.  And my advise to him is, ""Ryan if you ever start thinking about what your missing, don't.""",1270252800,,2419,4.600467289719626

They do nothing most of the film and then she just walks away when he shows up at her door to find she has a husband and family.  You call that chemistry? I call it boring.  I did enjoy the part played by the young girl, although her acting was strictly minor league.  I suspect I will get slammed by other readers for this review.  That is fine.

The film explores the lack of connection and empathy on his part in regard to the horrible job he has, and how others  can spend time with family while he has almost no one to spend time with except on a temporary basis.

I'm not sure why this had so many nominations.  It's solid work from Clooney but certainly not his best role by any means.  His role in O Brother, Where Art Thou?  was much stronger and more substantial.",1270080000,,616,4.177966101694915
3995991,5,B002VECMB8,"According to the tagline of the film, ""Up in the Air"" is about ""The story of a man ready to make a connection."" The irony is that Ryan Bingham, our protagonist, is a corporate downsizer, a man traveling across the country to fire employees. He is hired by their employers who would rather not see them in person. He spends his days traveling around the country to meet people he knows he will never see again.

""Up in the Air"" is a comedy drama, but its subject matter is immediate and very serious. Another irony of the film is that Ryan Bingham, the corporate downsizer ready to make a connection, is played by George Clooney, one of Hollywood's most likable stars. In fact Ryan, always efficient and professional, is able to charm his way through life. Ryan is so confident, and perhaps he should be, though we are aware that behind the amusing (and satirical) sketches of him there is something missing in his life.

Things get more complicated for him when Ryan meets two women: Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), an enigmatic frequent flyer Ryan sleeps with, and Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), his ambitious coworker selling her own idea to Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman): firing people through the Internet and video camera. Obviously Ryan's life is about to change, but can he really connect to other people? Or what does he want in his life?

Having seen ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno,"" I think Jason Reitman is one of the most talented directors of his generation. He turns controversial issues into drama with humor and thought-provoking challenges for viewers. He knows the right way to do it. You may not like what his characters are doing - and they often do it with confidence - but you definitely care them, or are at least interested in them and their life.

Not everything is perfect, I admit. Though her acting is fine, Anna Kendrick's character (her back story about the boyfriend, for instance) doesn't really convince. The story is told with good pace, but some part of it is a bit familiar, and charming Melanie Lynskey is sadly underused. Still ""Up in the Air"" is an intelligent comedy drama with one serious theme, bolstered by superb acting from the three leads, George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick.",1269907200,,2236,4.740359897172237
3995992,5,B002VECMB8,"I admittedly am a George Clooney basher.  Not that I spend much time or effort in doing so, but every time I review something he has a hand in making, I am always wondering what the uproar is about this guy.  He makes mediocre films at best and can't take a lead role in anything really worth watching.  That was until ""Up in the Air"".  This was a damn good movie.  Let me get that out of the way right up front.  George Clooney was fabulous in this picture.  Ryan, his character, was made for George Clooney to beautifully portray.

The film focuses on Ryan, whose primary job is firing people.  There appears to be too many people in management lacking the balls to extinguish their employees, so they hire Ryan and his company to fly in and do the job for them.  I happen to agree with the management lacking balls statement personally as well, but what do I know.  So Ryan flies in, cuts the driftwood and flies home.......  Well that is the interesting part.  He doesn't actually fly home, since he is on the road almost every day of every week of every month of every year.  He has no real home to fly to.

As with all misguided corporate flailing, Ryan's company hires a fledgling out of college who thinks that she can cut costs by firing people remotely, via web conference.  I love this.  How cathartic is corporate America becoming.  So Natalie brilliantly played by Anna Kendrick, sets out to learn the ropes from Ryan all the while setting up her cost saving death by video scenario.  In addition to tutoring young Natalie in the ways of death dealing, Ryan has found his love interest in the form of Alex, played by Vera Farmiga.  Possibly the one woman in the world as superficial as he is.

As with all lonely lost souls the second Ryan opens his heart it is crushed underfoot.  He might have found his only true calling, is a lonely existence, helping pathetic corporate America cut loose its dead weight.  It is a sad story showing how lonely we are as individuals even while we are engulfed by superficial relationships everywhere we turn.  How many people truly know us?  How many people care about who we are as individuals?  Where is the one or two true friends who help make our lives worth living?

If you only see a handful of movies each year, you really need to make ""Up in the Air"" one of them.  Hats off to Mr. Clooney for finally making a fantastic movie that gets you thinking, gives you hope, and crushes your sensitivity all at the same time.",1269907200,,2475,4.427937915742794
3995993,5,B002VECMB8,"In ""Up in the Air"" George Clooney starts off as a cold-blooded, self-absorbed man whose job is telling people that their companies are firing them (laying them off). His business is thriving because we are, of course, in the middle of a recession, His job requires him to travel incessantly and rack up millions of frequent flyer air miles. His goal in life, perhaps his only goal, is to prove how self-sufficient he is and reach ten million miles. He's good at his job at giving people the ax and uses psychology to make them accept it. He's full of slogans and bromides for himself and others.
 The ghoulish company he works for has a lot of people on the road flying everywhere to tell people that they've been made redundant; that their jobs have been terminated. As far as the poor people are concerned, they as human beings have been terminated. In many brief scenes we see these people reacting sometimes profanely to Clooney's news. He also, in his spare time, gives inspirational talks on how people have to be sharks and worry only about themselves and their needs, not to weigh themselves down, the philosophy of selfishness.
 Along comes a young woman who talks Clooney's boss into taking all the bad news purveyors off the road to save money by having the hapless terminated people be informed by tele-conferences. Clooney says the idea stinks because the people need to confront a real person.
 He takes this young woman out on the road to show her what the human dimensions of the job are. She has to first learn to pack economically and not have any checked luggage. Out on the road, as she gives the bad news, one woman even threatens suicide. It's hell out there, she finds out.
 The movie presents Clooney like a twenty-first century gladiator, packing his roll-on carry on bag which effortlessly fits into the overhead compartment. It shows how efficiently he goes through security, how he goes to the airport frequent flyer lounges, how often travel workers greet him by name. He loves being the seasoned, honored frequent traveler. He's a pro at what he does, spending 322 days on the road. But isn't he in reality a loser, lacking a co-pilot, nothing but a parenthesis?",1269907200,,2192,4.715404699738904
3995994,4,B002VECMB8,"Up in the Air is well made, has good actors, has a decent premise, and has some good moments. Four stars. But for me I did not connect with George Clooney playing Ryan Bingham, because Ryan Bingham seemed more of a sketch idea for a character than an actual person. I suppose the scenes where he takes Vera Farmiga's character to his home town were an attempt to provide some substance, but even that was more of a sketch - especially since even to his own family he was not really substantial. Ryan Bingham has no home (a bare apartment he's rarely in), no friends, no friendly co-workers, no past (except for the hometown visit), no real character at all. He feels more like a vehicle for a movie idea than a person. To Clooney's credit, he made Ryan Bingham watchable, because George is a likeable guy, but still I felt there was ""no there there"".

I thought Vera Farmiga was the best actor in this movie. She conveyed so much with just a look. Anna Kendrick was OK but didn't quite ring true in some scenes, such as when she breaks down in front of Ryan and Alex and tells them about what she wants from life. Jason Bateman and others were fine.

There were quite a few good moments - many from the people losing their jobs, some from Ryan's family, some from Alex, etc. There were some funny moments too. But for me it never pulled together into a great movie because I didn't really care about Ryan Bingham, or even really have much of an idea of who he was.

On a side note, the music choices for the movie were good but the music was almost too intrusive it was so up front at some points.

3995997,2,B002VECMB8,"Yikes.  I was really looking forward to seeing this much discussed film.  My review will not help the review of my reviews in general, since most folks seem to like it.

The premise is fascinating.  The execution seemed to me two-dimensional and predictable.  The writing had a couple of good moments, but most of it was wooden and ""mannered""--not the way real people actually talk (except for the real people actually in the film).

George Clooney's acting is likewise self-conscious and two-dimensional--as though he is always looking in the mirror, watching himself being the actor, George Clooney.  Maya F. who plays Alex, is a far more natural actor, and contributed the single memorable performance in the film.  She also had better lines and a wider range to work with, so that certainly helped.

It's too bad that such a potentially interesting film turned out almost never to leave George Clooney's head and enter the world in which he works, which supports the work he does, and which includes the actual other people with whom he interacts.  Ironically, the air bubble in which he exists would have stood out much more vividly, and interestingly, if there had been more in the film ... besides air bubbles.",1269648000,,1217,4.892682926829268
3995998,5,B002VECMB8,"In movies recently, American audiences are fed alot of crap, frankly. We get the inevitable Saw VI, Alvin And the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel, and other tripe that American filmgoers seem to flock to. Rarely are we shown a movie that shows people for what they really are, and life, for what it really is, and even less frequently do audiences actually acknowledge it. And, for this holiday season, which is more or less a dumping ground for Oscar nominees and hopefuls, we are shown a bright, intelligent, fresh, witty, hilarious, yet depressing picture from some of the best in the business. That picture, my friends, is Up in the Air.

Up in the Air features George Clooney as a man named Ryan Bingham, a ""corporate downsizer"", who goes from town to boring town, to fire employees, for businesses who don't have the guts to do it themselves. He's never had a real human connection in his life until he meets another frequent flyer named Alex, lovably played by Vera Farmiga, who showed real, gutsy, raw talent in the criminally overlooked horror flick Orphan, earlier this year. Alex shares alot of emotional stamina with Ryan, they click almost instantly. The chemistry that these two actors share is worth the price of admission alone.

Later on, we meet an ambitious young worker named Natalie (a beautiful star turn by Anna Kendrick, who had a brief part in the Twilight movies), who has an idea to cut costs by conducting employee layoffs from the internet.

After so many films a director makes, something of a trademark begins to appear, and Jason Reitman has his trademark down. And it's not a bad trademark like other directors certainly have. He has a knack for making emotionally relevant, and hilarious, yet deeply poignant and insightful films that are extremely watchable, and separate themselves from the usual Hollywood dreck that we're so used to.

His last film, 2007's Oscar hopeful Juno did kind of the same thing. It gave us that salty-sweet combination, and a lot of memorable dialogue. I could only imagine what this picture would be had Juno's Diablo Cody written it. But Reitman, writing alongside Sheldon Turner, whose previous credits include 2005's remake The Longest Yard, which I didn't particularly care for. As I've said, the writing here is witty, hilarious, and completely realistic.

Up in the Air is a very timely picture as well. Its major themes are corporate downsizing, and budget cuts. There's a scene in the movie where Natalie's boyfriend breaks up with her over a text message, and that's something that I know well, and I'm sure everybody else does as well. It brings up issues about how impossible love is if you're a member of today's generation, and that's part of what makes this movie so exciting.

Up in the Air is a difficult movie to describe. It's not quite a comedy, not quite a drama, and there's romance, but it's by no means a romantic comedy, or a romantic ""dramedy"". There's triumph and tragedy, laughs, and tears. But what's so amazing to me about it, is how closely it relates to real life. It's real, and rewarding, and a movie I'd certainly recommend.",1269475200,4,3115,4.813084112149533

 Last year's award nominated film, Up in the Air, provides many lovely aerial shots, along with a clever script, humor and competent performances.
 Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a big believer in keeping his distance. His life is about not letting anything, or especially anyone, close to him. In this film, directed by Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking and Juno) from the novel by Walter Kim, Ryan Bingham has based his life and his philosophy on travel. He spends all but a couple of his weeks in airplanes, conference rooms, rental cars and hotel rooms. The few weeks at ""home"" are in an apartment with as much personality as the hotel rooms that are more of a home to him.
 Bingham has two jobs. One is as roving ""life transition consultant"" (he fires people for bosses and corporations who would rather avoid such messy situations) and as a motivational speaker. In his speeches he uses the metaphor of a backpack. He asks his audience to imagine a backpack on their shoulders. He asks them to load the knick knacks of their houses into the backpack and then to imagine the feel of the straps on their shoulders. Then he asks them to imagine their furniture and car and house or apartment all in the backpack and the weight they would feel and the impossibility of moving around.
 Then he asks the audience to imagine their friends and family in the backpack. He argues that the more attachments one has, the tougher it is to move -- and moving is life. Talking to salespeople, he changes metaphors, and says they are sharks, and if they stop moving, they will die.
 There is something to be said about not being attached to material possessions. Jesus has a lot to say about being willing to give up stuff that would weigh us down.  But in the film, Bingham reconsiders his attitude toward relationships.
 It's true that keeping people at a distance keeps us from ugly sights (aerial views are prettier). But ultimately, Bingham learns that though people sometimes add to our loads, more often people help us carry our loads.
 In his job, he sees people that lose their jobs and have no place to turn, as opposed to the people who face such difficulties with the support of friends and family. The film also has an extensive scene in a Lutheran church. Sure, it's for a wedding, but it is a reminder of another place support can be found to carry our loads.
 The writer of Hebrews, in chapter 25:10, wrote, ""Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching.""
 We might be able to travel more quickly on our own. But we won't necessarily get where we want to be.",1269388800,,2880,4.563953488372093
3996000,2,B002VECMB8,"hmmm I'm a bit confused right now cos I may be posting this review for the wrong movie. This one is about Up In the Air, starring George Clooney. I have a feeling this is not the same film that most other reviewers saw.

This one is about a corporate American dude whose job is to basically tell people they are fired, in a way that leads to as little drama as possible. Apparently it's a job that pays pretty well, and also requires him to travel around the country from firm to firm. Now of course this lifestyle isn't really conducive to having a settled family and kids - unless you are interested in living a dual life - one on the road and one at home.

Ok, so does this film tell you anything you don't already know? Nope, nada. Fair enough, but there are many classy movies without an interesting message that can still entertain you for 2 hours. Is this one of those? Not a chance. Nothing and nobody interesting or engaging.

Work sucks. Working as a professional in America sucks big time - in the air or on the ground.

If I had a job like that, I'd be with a different woman every night. One needs their escape.

Indeed, it is not the feel-good flick of the year, but I feel like this movie has captured the current mood of our country's crisis with a solid cast and sharp-as-a-tack writing. I persoanally never felt depressed at any point in this fim, but then again it was a welcome relief from watching ""Precious"" the night prior.

3996002,4,B002VECMB8,"Synopsis:  Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a motivational speaker who collects his regular paycheck by traveling the United States and being a career transition counselor (read:  he conducts layoffs for companies who won't do it themselves.)  During his time spent traveling he talks about how glad he is not to have baggage per se (everything he needs travels in a carry-on) and how his big goal is to get ten million frequent flyer miles as a result of his travels. Bingham met another frequent flyer named Alex (Vera Farmiga) during his travels and the two pursue a friends-with-benefits kind of relationship.

Bingham is introduced to an ambitious young coworker named Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), whom has been hired to find a way to streamline the layoff process without involving much travel (much to Bingham's dismay because he won't get the miles).  Bingham convinces his boss Craig (Jason Bateman) to let him take Natalie throughout the country, as to show her the ropes per se.  While Bingham displays his typical callous demeanor, Natalie is shocked and saddened once the reality of her job hits her, leaving her disillusioned in what she's trying to accomplish for a career.

During their time away from the job, Bingham starts to miss companionship as a result of his time with Natalie while she starts to gain her independence.  And since their paths cross repeatedly, Alex starts to become more involved in Bingham's life.  Will Bingham continue to be the ""lone wolf"" he's always wanted to be or will he be willing to settle down?  Will Natalie effectively transition into her career as a remote ""career transition counselor?""

There were people I saw the movie with that lamented that the movie wasn't more light-hearted.  All I have to say is that this movie was an epic drama with funny parts throughout.  After I saw the movie, I was left thinking this question:  What if one day, when everything comes full-circle and everyone could get what they want, will people receive the things they really wanted or just what they convinced themselves they needed as life went on?  It made me think and for that, I chalk one in the positive column for not being mindless entertainment.

The movie deserves all the acclaim it's received and I highly recommend it to anyone age-appropriate to see it.",1269302400,,2313,4.907455012853471
3996003,5,B002VECMB8,"Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, Jason Reitman's latest hit Up in the Air revolves around Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who is hired to do what corporate bosses don't have the stomach to do: he fires people. As a corporate axe man, Ryan is constantly flying all over the country and is extremely systematic in his travels. He is very close to reaching that big number (10 million) in frequent flier miles, and this seems to be the solitary goal in his life. That is, until a wrench or two get thrown into the machine of Ryan's life.

He meets a fellow frequent flier named Alex (Vera Farmiga) in an airport lounge, and almost immediately begins the infatuation between them-or is it more than that? This is Ryan's question to himself, and with his way of doing business also put in jeopardy by a newcomer, Cornell graduate Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), he must also decide what he really wants in his life, and whether or not what he wants is best.

What makes Up in the Air work so well is the smart, edgy script, and the way the story never makes anything into a gimmick. There are many opportunities for broad jokes and gags to barge in, and in lesser hands, they very well might have. Luckily, Reitman handles the material with care, and delivers each scene with sharp precision. The comic and dramatic moments are brilliantly balanced, and there never seemed to be a moment of discomfort or awkwardness. It is a smooth plane ride without the turbulence of many dramatic comedies around these days.

This is the point I think: it is so rare to see such a well conceived and executed film such as this. It is so terrifically written and directed, polished and edited, and it delivers some excellent performances from Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick. There are also some delightful cameos from Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons, Danny McBride, and Sam Elliot, whose wisdom and presence grow the more his moustache does. His scene reminded me very much of the stranger's encounter with the Dude in The Big Lebowski.

I enjoyed Up in the Air much more than Juno in 2007. I found it to be sharper and more intelligent, and one of the best films of the year. All of the positive things I heard people say about Juno are here, and that has everything to do with the script. This reminded me more of Thank You For Smoking, which Jason Reitman also wrote. He is a tremendously talented and young director/writer, and I'm sure he has many great films left in him.",1269216000,,2455,4.585421412300684

One where the stoic individual that need no one breaks down in the end and even wants to be a part of something; this can be the start of something big. The second formula is firing people or tearing down a company. Waite did not we see this vary same combination in ""Office Space"", ""Cash McCall"", ""Pretty Woman"" etc.

So being left without innovation we are left with acting. Hey, wasn't George Clooney great in ""Solaris"" (2002) where he showed emotion or ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) where he showed action, now we get cardboard.

We start from nowhere go to nowhere. Moreover, do nothing. The only redeeming social value was the lady (Vera Farmiga) wearing the tie; now that was class.

I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. However, the voice over commentary helps you figure out what the purpose of the film was.",1269043200,,868,4.660130718954249
3996005,2,B002VECMB8,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

With the plague of 'corporate downsizing' now reaching its zenith, such a social phenomenon is bound to come to the attention of Hollywood's top name producers. Hence, Jason Reitman, son of famous Hollywood producer/director Ivan Reitman, has been given the reins to address this very issue. It also helps to have heart-throb George Clooney in the role of corporate down-sizer Ryan Bingham, who flies around the country as a sort of 'hired gun', informing various downsized employees that their services are no longer required.

Soon a young upstart, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), comes up with the brilliant idea of firing employees via a computer video linkup. One wonders why Ryan's company hadn't embraced this method years before, since obviously it is much more cost effective. And it's also hard to believe that a new employee such as Natalie, who is just out of school, would be the one introducing the new prototype as these video linkups (as just pointed out) have not only been around for quite some time but it's more likely a more experienced person would probably be responsible for developing or customizing it.

Somehow Ryan convinces his boss that 'face-to-face' firings still are much more preferable to firings via computer and that Natalie needs to understand the value of the 'human touch'. Ryan's boss puts the video project on hold and allows Ryan to keep jetting about firing people in person as long as Natalie accompanies him. This of course allows 'Up in the Air' to become something of a 'buddy' picture with Ryan and Natalie 'duking it out' over the nature of relationships. When Natalie finds out that Ryan has been having a casual affair with Alex, who is he is constantly meeting up with while on the road, she castigates him for not getting involved. Let me add that Natalie only becomes emotional over this issue after she has been dumped by her own boyfriend (via text message). For the most part, she is a one-note cold fish who soon learns the delicate art of firing people face to face, under Ryan's tutelage.

Not much happens during the 'second act' of 'Up in the Air'. Director Reitman spends too much time presenting cameos of real-life people recreating their reactions to the news that they've been downsized. Was it necessary to 'pad' the film with these cameos? Basically one minute of the fired employees would have been enough to convey the despair of these hapless people. There are additional repetitious scenes with Ryan, while moonlighting as a motivational speaker, utilizing a backpack to illustrate his 'life philosophy' to an audience of self-help junkies at various hotel conference rooms. Reitman wastes additional time with a scene where the three principals attend a corporate party, culminating with a 'heart-to-heart' talk between Alex and Ryan on a corporate yacht.

You would think that the big 'Act Two Climax' would have something to do with the relationship between Ryan, Alex and Natalie, but it doesn't. Instead, there's an awkward subplot that pops up involving Ryan's sister's fianc who gets cold feet just before he's about to get married. Ryan is called in by his other sister and uses his 'motivational speaker' skills to convince the errant husband-to-be, to go ahead with the wedding--which of course he does and the couple live happily ever after.

The wrap up of Act Three is decidedly a downer--and thoroughly unconvincing to boot. Despite the fact that Alex attends Ryan's sister's wedding and seemingly is now ready to become more involved with him, it just doesn't turn out that way. After giving up his motivational speaker gig, Ryan somehow finds Alex's home address and knocks on her door--only to discover that she is a married woman. Since Alex only wanted a casual relationship, it would have been much easier for her to simply tell Ryan that she was married and there would have been no hard feelings. But since the film's screenwriter was desperate to create some kind of drama (and there is so little of it in this film), we're treated to the unlikely scenario of Ryan being deflated when he discovers the true nature of Alex's marital status. As for Natalie, she quits the company after learning that one of the downsized employees that she had fired, killed herself. It appears that both Ryan and Natalie did not heed this particular employee's pronouncement while on one of their firing jaunts, as the woman did indeed explicitly state that she was going to jump off a bridge. Inexplicably, Ryan's boss puts the computer video link program on hold despite the fact that the communication between Ryan and Natalie and this particular employee, took place face to face!

Up in the Air is a slow-moving 'dramedy' with an underdeveloped plot. While it's a very nice-looking film, the actors can do very little with their parts due to the weak script. Clooney basically plays himself (as he usually does) and offers up an only serviceable performance. On the basis of director Reitman's last two films ('Juno' preceded 'Up in the Air'), it's likely we'll be seeing uninspired, mediocre films from him in the future.",1269043200,6,5148,4.944508670520231
3996006,3,B002VECMB8,"Is it amusing? Yes. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is there a message at the end? Yes. But is it this amazing, fantastic, best movie of the year that everyone is saying it is? Not really.

Is it the ""feel-good"" movie it claims to be on its packaging? No. See all those people smiling in the photos for this product page? Misleading. A big, fat lie. And that's a big clue as to what it knows about itself. It will not appeal to people who are looking for a feel-good comedy. You have to be prepared for ""depressing"". Nothing wrong with that, but I hate misleading packaging. At least it's nowhere near as dishonest as the packaging for ""World's Greatest Dad.""

3996007,5,B002VECMB8,"The beauty of this film is in the writing imho - a very timely approach at examining the current economic climate in America and how it affects those on both sides of the issue. The nuances are brilliantly framed through the lens that is Clooney's character (whose acting definitely deserved the academy award nomination that he got), a man who is on the 'safe' side of the layoff business but whose personal life leaves much to be desired. The acting, scriptwriting, directing are all too real - if only corporate America had as much insight as this script-writer, America might still be a pretty good place to live.",1269043200,2,617,4.722222222222222
3996008,4,B002VECMB8,"""Up In The Air"" is a reality check for individuals who have chosen professional and material success over family obligations and mainstream sentimentalities.  Yes, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) has made great sacrifices that seem unconventional, but does not conventionalism come with its own price?  ""Up In The Air"" reconciles unorthodox reasoning with collective thinking.  At one point in the movie when it appears that Bingham will become a relic of the past, he is redeemed.  It's a man versus machine moment when corporate heads decide to disband its new technology of contractually terminating employees through teleconferencing in favor of face-to-face relations.  In an altered reality, the boilerplate would have Bingham losing his job; due to the changing work environment and lamenting about the personal relationships he sacrificed to be a corporate dweller.  Fortunately, this doesn't happen, which is a ""thumbs up"" for personal choice.

  In the end, the clear message is that life is filled with choices that have an ""upside"" and a ""downside"" attached.  As one undergoes a ""Cost-Benefit Analysis,"" it is important to take the long view of a myriad of decisions.  There are no moral absolutes!  Rather, happiness is a culmination of core choices surrounding individual contentment.

 ""Up In The Air"" is a great movie for individuals on both sides of the equation--those who have abandoned personal relationships for professional success and those who have abandoned self actualization for familial responsibilities.

If you are Up in the Air about work, family, travel,
relationships, the economy, committment, loyalty,
career, well then this is the perfect movie for you...
From start to finish this is one movie that really takes off but never
really lands...and that is the movie,s intent

The film examines the cold, calculating  inhuman
methods of terminating people from their jobs and perhaps their identities as well.
It explores the impersonality of the modern work place
and the current corporate climate.

The films main character George Clooney, is a slick
carefree, non commital corporate suit flying from one location
to another terminating peoples livelihoods without regret.

Though he seems content flying high above the real world
of feelings, he eventually free falls into an abyss of
shocking isolation. He becomes a victim to his own
detachment and ruthlessness.  I won't spoil the shocker scene
but in a moment of frailty he discovers what it,s like to
be on the receiving end of getting the cold shoulder, and
it entails not just losing one,s job.

The entire cast give fine performances throughout this pertinent drama with very adept direction.  The script is solid, the editing tight and crisp.

If you,re looking for a short flight of entertainment
and introspection, then Up in the Air is the perfect
movie in which to land.  It will leave you reexamining
your own flights of fancy.

It brought back a lot of memory and certainly fun to watch, now that my heart no longer ached.

This movie has a great script and a great acting all around.  It correctly points out that we should re-evaluate our Life's goal every now and then.

I won't describe the story, since it's done so well throughout the other reviews. However, I will say that while I enjoyed it thoroughly, the firing parts can be a little rough to watch. I also would have liked many of the deleted scenes in the DVD ""extras"" (with the exception of one about a bizarre astronaut dream) to have been included in the movie to make the story and reactions of the characters come together better towards the end. In fact, there's a whole section of the story in these scenes about how Ryan manages his life after he's ""grounded"" in Omaha that makes these worth watching.

There aren't a lot of other extras on the DVD. But, there is a good director/writer commentary version which is also well worth watching! Insights about how they used real recently laid off folks without scripts for the firing scenes, other improvisations and how they shot in the various locations add a lot of insight and appeal to an already good movie.

Bottom Line: If you've ever been a frequent user of a frequent flyer program, worked for a large corporatation or just plain like George Clooney - you're going to like this one, and the limited but good extras make it even better.",1268611200,2,1499,4.520295202952029

I think that is the flaw of the movie, you have to actually hate the George Clooney character.  I didn't, I loved it.  The character, not Geoge Clooney.  Seriously, he made a great lifestyle choice and we are supposed to hate that?  He doesn't want to have kids?  So what?  If you see the commercials, that is what the film is about.  A guy has a boring job where he tells people that they are fired and he has to travel to do it.

Oh yea, his life sucks and he is a loner but he has a girlfriend through out the entire film?  The director serves this film to us in a dry/boring, almost too realistic manner.  I guess we are supposed to appreciate the low-key subtleness of the film.  Sorry, you guys aren't the Cohen brothers.  It just comes off as very, very boring.

3996021,5,B002VECMB8,"First of, I applaud the brilliance of Jason Reitman who masterfully
directed and wrote this film. He is proof that creative genius does
sometimes run in families. This film has very adult sensibilities in
it's wit & humor, it's weighty & timely subject matter, it's showing of how
we tend to compartmentalize our lives and attempt to control things in a way
which we think can gaurd us from being hurt, but of course, in the end we
are only fooling ourselves. Bottomline is, we are all built to interact
and in those interactions, there's going to be joy and there's going to be pain.
Nobody gets out of here unscathed, but if we are smart and lucky and take the risk
of commiting ourselves to something or someone, then we stand to gain much more
than we can ever loose. Out of all of George Clooney's performances so far,
I like him in this one the best!---He nails it and you feel for him completely.
His performance is supported beautifully by that of Vera Farmiga, who seems to be
his perfect female counterpart in his clean, cut & dry, no regrets/no attachments
life philosophy...at least it seems that way. (That later twist threw me for a loop!)

Anna Kendrick is great as the young over-achiever college grad who, in her way,
thinks she has her life and career all mapped out, but she too learns that just when
you think you have all the angles figured out, the game of life switches & shifts on you.
Jason Bateman is also great in his supporting role as George Clooney's and Anna Kendrick's
characters funny but very bottomline boss.
I also think it was brilliant of Jason Reitman to use people who have really
recently been fired from their jobs for no reason other than the economic downturn,
because it adds such depth and reality to their reactions when Clooney's
and Kendrick's characters do what it is that they do for a living,
which is flying from city to city and being the human resources ""heavies"" for
companies who don't even have the guts to fire their own otherwise loyal and
hardworking employees face to face. Many of these people reflect the scenarios
of what so many others in this situation have had to deal with....just heart-breaking stuff.
This is a great film and deserves all the accolades it's received this year.
It gets off some great messages without being preachy about it.

3996022,5,B002VECMB8,"Up in the Air is an entertaining, sardonic, prescient, honest dramedy for grown-ups. It is also among the very best films of the year. It is basically Clooney's vehicle entirely; here he plays Ryan Bingham, a man who is constantly traveling around the country helping companies facilitate mass layoffs and artfully giving employees the bad news. He is sharp and experienced, and if not satisfied in life then subconsciously at peace with it. Enter in Vera Farmiga as his sexy and consistently interesting lover, and Anna Kendrick, as the new kid on the block hoping to revolutionize the ""employee transition"" process via online video conferencing. The three intersect with eachother in varied ways, each teaching the other deep life lessons in the guise of everyday circumstance and twists of fate. Jason Reitman directs lean, nuanced performances out of the actors, and gives the film a visual sheen congruent to the character's too-structured lives. The film is basically about major life themes of life, regret, love, personal responsibility, and in the subtle ways growing older influences your choices and carves out a path for you different than anything you anticipated. Clooney and Farmiga are as charming as any characters you're likely to see, and the film has undertones of sincerity that quickly make you invested in it and wanting everything to be tied up neatly in the end. Life, however, seldom turns out that way, but Up in the Air serves as a gentle reminder that no one is perfect, and that no one is ever really alone.",1268524800,2,1537,4.98443579766537

The movie shows George in an airport, shows the name of the city on the screen, Georges fires someone, George is back flying again, city name on the screen, fires someone, etc., et....  It never goes anywhere of interest.  The fact that he and the supporting female character were nominated for academy awards is beyond me.  Neither put in a ""wow"" performance.

3996024,4,B002VECMB8,"This movie did an amazing thing it took a fairly serious look at downsizing at a personal level at various companies, but it made me smile almost all the way through the movie. The movie took place in cities like Omaha, Des Moines, Milwaukee and Detroit. The movie didn't pull punches at the final interviews. I've been downsized and this felt real. These people were hurting in different ways. The laughable help the company provides for placement was just right. My manager gave me a help wanted page ad from the local paper for a job $40k less than my current salary and for which I wasn't really qualified. He must have spent a minute looking for it. However, the movie did not lambaste the companies. The companies were hurting too.  The movie did not take the obvious route in most of the movie. There were some nice twists.

The actors were all good, but George Clooney was great. He exhibited just the right amount of charm and denial. He was going through a mid life crisis and there were no easy answers. He had the life he wanted, but realized it was empty. He daily job of firing people emphasized his own emptiness. Clooney's character was an inspirational speaker too. His speech was hilarious and scary. Some people think this way.

Jason Bateman was good too. He played the boss, who was trying to run the company the best way he knew how, but basically was an insensitive jerk. Who else could come up with a company like this?

I strongly recommend the movie. It has comedy, charm, and pathos. It is a great look at our society and what it values.",1268524800,,1564,4.5159010600706715

3996028,5,B002VECMB8,"In the run-up to the recent 2010 Academy Awards, it seemed like the only thing people could talk about was the matchup between the mighty ""Avatar"" and little ""The Hurt Locker"". Both fine films in their own right. But lost in all the noisy hub-bub was another small, marvelous, nominated film. It had no space aliens or bombs going off. Instead it was just a well made, quiet, intelligent film about people called ""Up in the Air"".

In ""Up in the Air"" we meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who makes his living traveling from company to company firing/laying off employees in the downturn economy. In other words, he's a professional hatchetman. He does his job with a certain sense of style and grace. He sets people adrift, gently. He travels without end, living a life, that is mainly made up of airport bars & lounges, rental car counters and chain hotels. What we hate about traveling he loves. His one kick in life seems to be collecting exclusive memberships in travel industry clubs, that offer big perks to those on the road and in the skies. What he dosn't have is a real home, wife, children or significant other ETC. Instead he espouses and lives an insular life without any true emotional responsiblities or commitments.

This all changes when two women enter his life. One is Natalie (Anna Kendrick) a smart, energetic, young woman, who's business ideas could lead to the end of Ryan's nomadic wanderings (she wants employees fired via the internet). The other is Alex (Vera Farmiga), a mature, sexy business woman, who seems 'to get' Ryan's interests and lifestyle. Ryan and Alex meet at various junctures on the road for a series of sexual liasons. Together, these two interesting women turn Ryan's life upside down, causing him to finally question the path he has chosen for himself.

Writer/Director, Jason Rietman has created a film, which is a wonderful character study. It portrays a man, who at first thinks he knows it all, but winds up eventually questioning everything. I love the way Reitman strips away his characters, until finally the truth is revealed. ""Up in the Air"" has a smart and funny script, which has razor-sharp, intelligent dialogue. It treats its characters with respect. I really love the fact that this movie dosn't try to tie everything up with a fake Hollywood ending. Instead the film leaves us on a more ambiguous note.

The cast in this film is steller. George Clooney essentially gives the best performance of his career (so far). Anna Kendrick also gives a poised, well acted performance as the young upstart, who is both a pain and conscious for Clooney's character. But the real discovery of the film is actress, Vera Farmiga. She really gives a ""star is born"" type of performance. Its hard to match an actor like Clooney, charisma-wise, but Vera Farmiga manages to do it. Her sexy, smart business woman really jumps out at you. Its an amazing performance. I predict big things for this actress in the future.

I think ""Up in the Air"" was one of the best movies I saw all year. Its both heartfelt and humorous. A great piece of storytelling. Give it a try!",1268352000,2,3107,4.7569573283859

3996031,3,B002VECMB8,"Jason Reitman directs his third dramedy of contemporary social mores with ""Up in the Air"", based on the novel of the same name by Walter Kirn. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) flies around the country firing people for a living. He works for an Omaha-based company that is paid by other companies to fire their employees, a business that's booming in the recession. But ambitious young Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) proposes to save the company money and keep the terminators home by creating a system to fire people remotely, via a video link. Ryan balks, and his boss (Jason Bateman) sends him on the road with Natalie so that she might benefit from his experience, which also gives him a chance to hook up with Alex (Vera Farmiga), a fellow vagabond and itinerant lover.

In spite of the security measures, oxygen deprivation, bad food, and cramped seating, this guy loves airports and air travel. The airport scenes are the most memorable and will probably be looked upon by future generations of filmgoers as representative of the times. That is where ""Up in the Air"" is most successful. It smoothly represents an angst peculiar to early 21st-century careerists who criss-cross the country to climb the corporate ladder. It also taps into one of the grim realities of the current economic crisis: high unemployment. George Clooney is charming. It mercifully avoids traditional romantic comedy territory. It wraps up neatly. ""Up in the Air"" is well-constructed light entertainment that stops short of being appealing.

As suave and manipulative as Ryan is, he makes a living by lying to people. Natalie is alternately callous and childish. At some point it occurred to me that all three business travelers are dishonest, hypocritical, and distasteful. It was about the time the film turned preachy, not about the characters' lack of scruple but about Ryan's loner lifestyle, which is trivial. And it is the only thing about Ryan that is appealing. Why would a movie preach against the very thing that keeps us watching? We have a timely milieu, some sharp dialogue, and a trio of distasteful characters in a movie whose message is ""everybody needs somebody"". It's trite. What begins as an edgy dramedy ends up screaming: ""I conform!"" It's fun to watch Ryan and Alex one-up each other in one-liners and bedroom antics, but -yikes!- what an insidious, sheepish denouement.

The DVD (Paramount 2010): There are 5 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a teaser trailer (2 min), and theatrical trailer (2  min), an audio commentary, and one featurette.

3996032,5,B002VECMB8,"Jason Reitman's Up In The Air deftly balances a light comedic approach with the stark reality of today's down economic times.  George Clooney is at his confident & charming best as Ryan Bingham a hired corporate hatchet man who fires people for a living and spends about 320 a year on the road.  Ryan has created a bubble for himself where he has essentially shut himself off from any personal relationships including his family and has stripped himself of most of his possessions to those only of essence to his work existence.  He meets the sexy and smart Alex (Vera Farmiga) on one of his trips and they set His world is threatened to collapse when a young Ivy Leaguer, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) joins his company and pitches an idea to eliminate the need to go on the road by doing the firings over the internet.  Ryan balks at the idea and reluctantly takes Natalie on the road to show her the ropes.  Along the way Ryan starts to break out of his self-imposed cocoon and see that people and personal relationships are important.  Mr. Clooney, Ms. Farmiga and Ms. Kendrick all give Oscar worthy performances and the rest of the cast is equally appealing including Jason Bateman as Ryan & Natalie's somewhat sleazy boss and Danny McBride as Ryan's soon to be brother-in-law.  J.K. Simmons has a hilarious and poignant cameo as one the people Ryan & Natalie fire as does Zach Galifianakis in the opening scene as the first person we see Ryan fire.

It's really strange how a lot of my college classes in the past year have coincided with movies I end up watching. Right now, I'm taking a course on Civic Engagement & The Power of Social Capital, then another on Business Anthropology. Civic Engagement basically teaches us that society as a whole isn't what it used to be; people are more isolated these days, technology has made us inexplicably more distant from one another, and there just isn't much of a human connection anymore, at least like there used to be in generations past. Business Anthropology is about the concepts of change and difference and how things (be they in life or the business world) are always evolving and need to adapt over time. Enter: Up in the Air, an incredibly accurate testament and indicative measure of the times we're currently living in and the complications that come with it. It's a story about how we choose to live our lives and is backed by a very clever analogy in ""The Empty Backpack."" Of all the material things we own and all the people we know and the baggage that comes with those relationships, do we really need to weigh ourselves down with that? Our dead-end jobs, friends, and family; is there really a point to having all of these and keeping them close outside of what cultural norms tell us we need? On the other hand, if we didn't engage with one another and actually socialize from time to time, humanity certainly wouldn't be as welcoming and we all probably wouldn't have those friends and family to share some of the happier moments with. I think this movie does a brilliant job with its script and screenplay showing both the benefits and hindrances of choosing between the two lifestyles. Until this semester, I would actually say I was somewhere in-between, but leaning closer to the loner side. However, with these classes and now the viewing of this fine movie, I'd say I'm stuck back in the middle again, but with no real preference. Moderation and balance are always a good thing, right? And with that said, kudos to Jason Reitman for a very poignant film and to George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick for some outstanding performances. Up in the Air may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those interested in a ""ground-based"" (there's an oxymoron), slice-of-life drama, that's also a great psychological and character study about how society works, this is definitely worth a watch.

Video - 5.0

Brought to you by Paramount in 1080p via the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, Up in the Air is as perfect a picture as you will find. Colors are vibrant from the very beginning of the opening credits sequence and throughout the entire movie, separating clothes, backgrounds, skin tones, hair, lighting, etc. Detail and textures are also very distinct between people and objects, most notably for me between George Clooney and the many suits he wears and the patterns on both his and everyone else's business attire. Black levels are deep, though not amazingly so given there are very few instances of pure pitch blackness. Contrast is also excellent and compliments the fine layer of grain for a remarkably theatrical feel. There are also zero instances of artifacting, debris, and image manipulation. It's not reference material in the sense of wowing your guests, but flawless is still flawless.

Audio - 4.5

Some may find it odd to give a dialogue-driven character drama a 4.5 for audio, but even with its limited sound design, this DTS-HD track is surprisingly ample. Dialogue is clear with no dropout or volume issues, and what few ambient sound effects there are resonate accordingly from the front and side speakers. But the star of the audio is the music, which really supports the film as a whole emanating profusely from all speakers and creating a subtle, if not melancholy, mood to help convey the story. The only element obviously lacking, though, are any real levels of LFE output. There's one scene during a party that makes for some great bass in the on-screen music, but that's it.

Extras - 2.0

Armed with only a commentary track (a pretty good one) and deleted scenes (in HD, and also with good commentary), Up in the Air doesn't have much else aside from a couple of features about how they constructed the opening sequence and a storyboard comparison. I would really liked to have seen interviews from the rest of the staff, the author of the original book, or cast members about there thoughts on the film itself, but perhaps they thought the film wouldn't be as well-received enough, and hence, decided not to go through the trouble? That's a shame.

Overall - 4.0

While the extras are severely lacking, I'd still highly recommend this film for its outstanding story and A/V presentation. It's a story that I, personally, find very enduring and enjoyable thanks in part to its eloquent message about isolation, the benefits of companionship, the deteriorating affinity we have with one another, the impact of change, and just how important it is to see both sides of the coin when it comes to life. With outstanding direction and writing from Reitman, a subtle, yet fun script, exceptional performances by veterans Clooney and Farmiga, and a prominent job by Kendrick (who shows a lot of potential), Up in the Air is one of the finest character dramas I've seen in a while and should be one of the things you keep in your proverbial backpack.",1268092800,,5434,4.778487752928648

3996038,5,B002VECMB8,"George Clooney does a terrific job in this drama comedy about the ultimate in alienation in the American work place.  His job is firing people around the country.  But that's just the surface.  He is the ultimate disconnect, the logical progression of where we went as a people in moving our work lives further and further away from the rest of our lives.  Clooney's character made the total jump and has NO life apart from moving from airport to airport and hotel room and hotel room as he does his job. His apartment could be a hotel room.  There are two women who start to warm him up into becoming a human being.  One is a career woman who like he is in the air a lot.  The other is a new female protege who has been hired to revolutionize the whole process so that she can fire people over a laptop linkup.  Clooney will be doing the same.  The young woman, however, unlike Clooney and the career woman, is a ball of emotion over everything.  She took this job solely to follow a man to the city rather than having a man follow her (since she was the top of her class). He breaks up with her and she melts down.  It turns out she wants ALL the personal stuff and this corporate lifestyle was something for her to do before she got it.  So here she is the brightest and most modern of all of them, a whiz at high tech no less, yet she is also the least alienated. The difference is that she is emotional.  Clooney begins to wake up to his own emotions and starts to become a human being as well.  His life begins to get messy in all respects which is what emotions do to us. See this film.  It is terrific.

3996039,5,B002VECMB8,"UP IN THE AIR is one of those small, quiet films that builds up impact, and then hits you over the heart with everything it's got.  The film follows Ryan Bingham (no relation to the country singer/composer of CRAZY HEART, by the way) as he flies across the nation firing people.  Ryan doesn't care much for love and marriage (despite his kid sister's upcoming wedding), but he falls hard for Alex, another frequent-flier.  The biggest thing in Ryan's life is his job; but that's all about to change.

Okay, the plot for UP IN THE AIR sounds rather tedious.  And, in lesser hands, it would be.  The film isn't a romantic comedy; nor is it a serious contemplation on the redemptive/destructive power of love.  It's a commentary on the current economic status (most of the people getting fired in this film are non-actors reliving the moment they lost their job); and yet it never takes itself too seriously.  It features stellar chemistry from the two leads (George Clooney and Vera Farmiga, both deserving their Oscar nods and more), as well as strong support from Anna Kendrick (also deserving that Oscar nod), Jason Bateman, and cameos from J.K. Simmons, Sam Eliot, Danny McBride, Zack Galifianakis.  The directing (courtesy of Jason Reitman, surpassing his previous films JUNO and even THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) is top-notch, and the script is stellar; if the film has any flaw, it's that it comes off as a bit over-polished.  And yet, with such a likable and enigmatic cast (boldly led by Clooney at his finest), this film also feels organic and natural.  UP IN THE AIR is proof that serious filmmaking still exists in Hollywood.",1267833600,,1629,4.802867383512544
3996040,5,B002VECMB8,"Up in the Air is a timely story about the frontline, corporate downsizers who terminate workers across the country.  It's an unpleasant job with emotional backlash, and George Clooney's performance as a top gun terminator is exemplary. Abetted by assured direction by Jason Reitman (Juno), this is a film for our times.

Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is very good at what he does, and he has the mileage to prove it.  You see, corporations hire him to fly across the country to fire their employees.  So good is Bingham that he has a perfect response for every possible reaction or objection.  It is an art, and he has honed his skills over the years while living an insulated life of perks and frequent flier miles without any emotional attachments or long term plans for the future.  He is even distant from his family.  He has his routine down and lectures as a motivational speaker.  Ah, what a life.

During a layover, he meets another frequent flyer, Alex (Vera Farmiga), who, like him, jets cross country and lives on her corporate credit cards and comps.  So begins their jet setting affair and multi-city rendezvous.  When Ryan's employer decides to streamline expenses, a new hired gun, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), brings big changes including cutting down travel expenses and relying more on a telemarketer setup to conduct the corporate firings.  This is a direct threat to Ryan's lifestyle and he proposes to show her the ropes and what it is like to personally fire someone.  It is a sobering, learning experience for Natalie as Ryan mentors her and espouses his words of wisdom and his hands on approach compared to her more empirical, scientific methods.  It becomes apparent that they have differing values and philosophies on life.  When Natalie tries to do a firing, it becomes a game changing event with severe ramifications for all.  She is the young, wide eyed idealist, who learns about life the hard way.

At the same time, Ryan's sister calls about a wedding that he is reluctant to attend.  While most people go home for the holidays, he feels the opposite.  He grudgingly takes pictures of cardboard replicas of his sister and fianc in his travels since they can't afford the trips.  He even uses his powers of persuasion on his sister's fianc who has second thoughts about marriage.  It is in this moment that Ryan has an epiphany and learns about himself and what's important in life.  As Ryan begins to have feelings for Alex and sets about to make his future, he discovers some startling, harsh truths that will alter his outlook on life forever.

Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, Reitman has created a smart, engaging film whose subject of corporate firings amid an economic downturn is quite timely.  It is those scenes that are fascinating as they are heartbreaking, and Clooney's Ryan is a master at finessing verbal interplay.  This film puts faces and souls on the nameless whose lives are destroyed.  A scene where a fired employee (J. K. Simmons is excellent) is inspired by Ryan to try something else is masterfully written.

Clooney's Ryan is a distant cousin of sorts to his recent standout job in Michael Clayton.  Rarely has he been more charming!  His character lives in airport terminals and judges his success by his independence and frequent flyer miles.  When Natalie, Alex and his own family converge on his life, we see him change, and that is what makes the film so special.  To see someone whose outlook on life is changed forever is a rewarding, enriching feeling.  When Ryan and Alex talk about life from their experiences, it is in stark contrast to the neophyte Natalie.  What is refreshing is to see how Ryan becomes genuinely affected and how in the end he does the right things to correct an injustice.

Farmiga (The Departed) registers strongly as the mysterious lover, and Kendrick (Twilight) shines as the nave Natalie.  Jason Bateman (Juno) re-ups with Reitman and scores as a corporate manager.  A note of interest is that many of the fired workers are played by actual, laid off employees so that their scenes do take on a sense of immediacy and realism.

This is one of those films that makes all the best lists of the year because it's smartly written, well acted, and leaves you with that aftertaste of time well spent.",1267747200,,4280,4.782016348773842
3996041,5,B002VECMB8,"Director Jason Reitman, the director of Juno, has given us one of the best films of the year with Up In The Air, a superb character study about the meaning of life. Both heartbreaking and hilarious, this is a culturally relevant and timely film that is not easily forgotten.

George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man who fires people for a living. He basically executes what the big bosses are too timid to carry out themselves, and he has it down to a science. On the side, he is a motivational speaker who encourages his listeners to get rid of the excess baggage in their lives, in an effort to reach their personal goals and make their dreams a reality. The only problem is that Ryan does not have much of a life to speak of. He lives out of his suitcase, and has distanced himself from his friends and family, and has given himself over to casual relationships instead. His personal goal is to reach ten million frequent flier miles, and he is almost there. On one particular business trip, he meets and becomes close with a fellow frequent flier named Alex. They instantly hit it off, and begin an affair.

Meanwhile, back at the company offices, Ryan meets his new colleague, Natalie Keener. She is young, headstrong, and ultimately determined to work her way up in the business. Ryan feels threatened by the young lady, and insists that she is too nave to carry out the demands of the job. It is at this moment that the boss suggests that Ryan take Natalie along with him on his travels to show her the ropes. She goes along with Ryan, and sits beside him as he brings in numerous unsuspecting individuals, and informs them that their jobs have been terminated. He asks each individual to see the situation in a positive light. It's not a termination so much as it is an opportunity to begin again. Ryan is a master of persuasion, and some people step away with a hopeful outlook. Others break down in shock - angry, frustrated, and confused. After a particularly disturbing encounter, Natalie begins to examine her position from an ethical standpoint. Of course, Ryan is there to soften the blow, as he tries to put things into perspective for her, with ambiguous results. Natalie returns to the main office, where she formulates a system that will allow her to fire people via the internet, rather than having to do it face to face.

Alex meets up with Ryan shortly thereafter, and their relationship grows from casual to something a bit more serious. Ryan invites Alex to his sister's wedding, and she accompanies him. It is during this time that Ryan's journey really begins. Will he remain an avid frequent flier, living in isolation, bouncing from hotel room to hotel room, or will he grab hold of the life that he has left and find true meaning? This is the existential dilemma that drives the film.

The performances are excellent all around. George Clooney plays Ryan, and totally becomes the character. This is his best performance in years. It's Clooney as you have never seen him before. Vera Farmiga plays his love interest, Alex.  She may receive an Oscar nomination for her work here. Anna Kendrick plays Natalie, and she is simply breathtaking. She has come a long way since Twilight.

Jason Reitman proves once again that he is a director to watch. This film is just as strong as Juno, and just as important.

The only thing though is that I felt the movie is not completed and there is something missing, not at the ending, but rather something in the process. But that was the feeling before I watched the Bluray version with the deleted scenes, especially the last two sequences. They actually push the movie to something fantastic, and make the story whole and quite arty. The whole story took place in the troubled time, and everything around was casted in a grey sad colour. But at the end it was"" family"" support, warm, comfort and encourage everybody to get through. But what did Ryan get from all these experience or anything changed to his philosophy and his life?  How Nat dealt with the suicide case, would she be in law pursuit trouble? The answer seems to be there, but the movie just did say enough leaving the characters less fullness. The two deleted scenes gave me complete satisfaction on everything. Their running times are every long and in HD quality, well edited. It seems it's just because  they need to fit the movie to the cinema rules, so they have to cut the two deleted scenes down, and I'm sure in later DVD and Bluray, there will be the director's extended cut to show the movie as it should be.

For such a grim task  he comes with a great smile, a cool attitude, and an happy complexion, like a scorpio on honeymoon. He goes from airport, to luxury hotel, to Office to airport, to luxury hotel, to office in different cities with the task of saying: ""OK, old buddy, I'm so sorry but... you're fired"". He has also the task of training a young employee for this thankless job. Meanwhile, he enjoys volatile (that's the word!) encounters with a friend and lover. Soon we'll see what an empty life is this, and he'll realize that too, in a most harrowing way.
This is a very poignant social commentary, very sad but so true: and the uprooter of jobs is so good at his job, we learn, because HE HAS NO ROOTS.",1267315200,,874,4.361963190184049

3996045,5,B002VECMB8,"People will call Avatar and Inglourious Basterds the purest entertainment of 2009. Those are my other 2 favorite films of the year, behind ""Up In The Air"". I walked into this film with relatively low expectations, thinking it was going to be the big overrated Oscar sensation of the year, and was hugely wrong on that prediction. Instead, I was given a film with a flawless balance of comedy and drama. That's right, absolutely flawless. This is one of those rare films in which the characters are the ones running the movie, and not the story line. Although the story is fascinating in every way, it's the chemistry between the films ensemble that makes this film work so well that it's placed in an atmosphere of respect I give to very few current films. If you can say that the characters are honestly the most interesting thing about the entire movie, then you are one step in the right direction of making an excellent film because most characters and their dialogue is strictly filler in most films nowadays. ""Up In The Air"" feels wonderfully authentic and the story's entire execution is as sharp as any other. It's just as hysterical as it is tragic, which is a difficult task that's almost impossible to accomplish. The film sets up about every contrived dramedy cliche imaginable and then completely side steps every single one, giving you one of the most enjoyable and clever films you've seen in a while.

3996046,2,B002VECMB8,"My husband and I just saw UP IN THE AIR, and I have to say that neither of us liked it very much.  UP IN THE AIR is a depressing, unsatisfying waste of time.  A movie should entertain me, teach me something, or make me think.  UP IN THE AIR did none of these things.

UP IN THE AIR is the story of Ryan Bingham, a man who spends most of his life on the road:  in airplanes, hotel rooms, bars, and restaurants.  His job?  To travel from company to company firing people.  He is never in one place very long, and he has no real relationships.  He doesn't really even know his family.  His main goal in life is to reach 10 million frequent flier miles, a number only 6 people have reached prior to him.  His life is all about loyalty status and points.  But suddenly, his company decides that they are going to try to fire people via internet video conferencing, instead of face to face.  Bingham is going to be grounded, forced to actually live in Omaha, and to give up his swanky life style.  Oh my, what will happen next?  Do I even care? Uh, no...

I am not sure what the point is to UP IN THE AIR.  For two hours, we watch this man fight to stay on the road, so he can increase his status.  He is shallow, has no attachments, and no other interests.  Even when he finally meets a woman, one who understands him, one he might actually WANT to settle down with, it turns out to all be a lie.  The viewer ends up frustrated and irritated.  After two hours of watching increasingly unsympathetic characters, I at least want the big change, the happy ending.  I felt nothing for anyone in this film, except for the people he so callously and adeptly fired.

UP IN THE AIR is painful to watch, and IMHO, not funny at all.  Seriously, I want those two hours of my life back.  If UP IN THE AIR is the best that 2009 has to offer, then I am really glad we have moved on to 2010.",1266969600,11,1871,4.102209944751381
3996047,4,B002VECMB8,"**contains spoilers**

I enjoyed the film, but as someone else said ""something is missing."" As a semi-frequent traveller myself I was interested in the storyline of airports and rental car companies, lines and priority club memberships, but that of course was made more of a backdrop to the main character's relationship with himself and really no one else. I knew we would be set up with a contrite and typical ""cherish your family and relationships"" kind of ending so I wasn't surprised by it, but I guess I was still disappointed with it none the less. Another minor criticism is that the movie has kind of a cheap corporate feel to it, like one long commercial for Hertz, American Airlines, and Hilton Hotels.

The movie was funny at times and was entertaining, though a bit slow-moving I thought and after waiting for a pay-off, we get the usual contrite ending of ""cherish your family and relationships."" Now that I've said that twice in my review, wouldn't it annoy you if I said it another 3 or 4 times in this review? Well, that's how this movie felt to me - I've heard this all before, so I was annoyed with the film's ""message.""

Clooney is good in the role but his acting is not really memorable as it was in say ""Michael Clayton"" - I felt he really nailed that character role.  Although I did like the anti-climacticness of him reaching his goal of 10 million lifetime frequent flier miles. This seemed sort of realistic to me. Have you ever had a goal you had set for yourself, and once you reach it, it maybe isn't quite what you expected or it's great, but then it's over and now what? Clooney's characters goal to reach 10 million frequent flier miles was such a part of who he was that ""going after"" the goal was really the goal itself. So once he achieved it, it felt a little unremarkable to him, because if he isn't the guy going after that goal, then who is he?

I liked his character but even that was a problem because in the end he felt the need to change himself. And over what? Because he got hurt by the first girl he cared about in a long time? At least the film didn't make him fall in love and love conquers all, the end. I was glad when he found out the girl he was into was married. I mean it made sense after all. The way you begin in a relationship says a lot about the relationship. If you are a ""casual guy"" as his character was, then you likely will attract those looking for casual relationships. Clooney's character before the girl realized this, and embraced this about himself. Who he became at the end of the film was just another cookie cutter character.

**January 2011: I've watched this film three times now and although there are parts of the film I don't like, it is a movie I have enjoyed re-watching and have enjoyed the film more after the 2nd and 3rd viewing.

STARRING: George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey, J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Elliot

WRITTEN BY: Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner; based on the novel by Walter Kern

DIRECTED BY: Jason Reitman
Rated: R
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 23 December 2009

I wouldn't say George Clooney is one of the best actors as far as range is concerned; but he is a long way from the worst and is certainly one of the most likable. Clooney brings his own charisma to the screen that's nothing short of A-list status. It's his unique delivery and charming personality that makes him so enjoyable to watch and there is no shortage of either in the hilarious comedy, Up in the Air.

Clooney plays Ryan Bingham; a guy who's more comfortable in a three piece suit than he would be in his pajamas or lounge-wear. He has fired so many people throughout his career that he can't remember the last time he actually hired someone.

He is exceptional at this. He's a fire extinguisher to ruckuses and potential lawsuits. His company is so enthralled with his `tact' of letting people go, that they spend a small fortune sending him all over the country to do so, for other companies.

It's because of this lifestyle that Ryan prefers being `up in the air' than down on the ground. `Up in the air' meaning the amount of time he spends flying to and from cities to fire people. There are perhaps half a dozen or more additional metaphors to be found in the title; one of the biggest being that his character lives `up in the air' instead of in reality with the rest of us.

He has no wife, no kids, no pets and no friends. What little family he has, barely considers him relevant. His home is an absolute joke and is less appealing than the frequent hotels he spends more than two thirds of every year, living in. He has only his career and the occasional one night stand here and there; forming from a few cocktails at whatever hotel's bar he spends his evening at.

It's at one of these said locations, that he meets his match, Alex; played delightfully by Vera Farmiga. Thank God someone has finally given her the Oscar nomination she has been so deserving of!

Farmiga plays Alex to be every bit as pathetic as Ryan, in reference to their similar tastes and personalities. Naturally, neither of them wants any sort of a commitment. With all of that as un-satisfying as it may sound to the majority - Ryan couldn't be happier.

His world is flipped upside down however, when his company grows weary of the financial strain that this brings to them each fiscal year. They hire an uptight young woman straight out of college, with her hair pulled back just a little too tight, to put a new plan in motion.

The woman is 23-year-old Natalie Keener, played magnificently by Anna Kendrick. Her plan is to ground the twenty-something employees they fly around excessively to fire people. They will instead, do all of their terminating electronically via web-cam. Sounds thoughtful huh?

Ryan is crushed to say the least. We get the sad-puppy-dog-Clooney face that we have all become familiar with, as he sits in his chair barely able to breathe during this little conference. Whatever will he do? What will his life become if he is to be stuck in the same location day in and day out? Ryan can't and won't let that happen.

He challenges the youngster in front of their boss, played terrifically by Jason Bateman. Ryan outsmarts her, but in the end is put side by side with her to finish out the last few clients that are to be let go in person. This scene is very smartly written, well acted and hysterical, as was the entire film.

In addition to enjoying his job to the fullest extent possible, Ryan's other goal is to reach a certain amount of frequent flyer miles. The number is so disgusting that I won't even share it with you. Should Ryan hit his target number, he will be awarded with a string of nuances, and will be among an elite single digit number of people to have done this, in the world.

On their last few firing frenzies together, we learn a lot about Ryan and we learn a lot about Natalie and hopefully a thing or two about ourselves. They help each other with personal problems and character flaws, which are to be expected, but it's never predictable or corny. There are some very nice twists rolled into the second and third acts as well, including a major one, that I never saw coming.

The film is full of laugh-out-loud moments that couldn't have been better written. The story moves along at 100 miles an hour and we are never bored even for a second. I've heard some people consider it to be a comedy / drama, and it does contain some dramatic elements; but it's very much a comedy, to me.

Clooney definitely has some competition from the other nominees, in regards to taking home the Oscar, but we will see what happens. Up in the Air is well deserving of every single nomination it received and it could easily walk away with several of them.

I liked writer / director Jason Reitman's first film Thank You for Smoking, I loved his second film Juno, and this was his best one yet. The man is severely talented and with these three perfect films under his belt, it's safe to say the sky is the limit for him. Don't worry I won't be overly cheesy and say that his success will bring him `Up in the air.' That would be too much.",1266796800,2,5412,4.504081632653061
3996050,5,B002VECMB8,"The film begins by showing us views taken from the plane; you know that sense of everything being so far down there, so unreal and disconnected from you.  I believe most people have the feeling of isolation when on a plane that things below look so small and insignificant with distinctly defined lines and markings.  This is in fact true of Ryan Bingham (Georgorgeous Clooney)who prides himself on being unencumbered by any ties, who spends the biggest part of his life flying from state to stete, laying people off.  The role his job has trained him to play, namely to be cooly polite and calmly aloof is the one he has espoused in real life.  In other words his work role and his real life role are one and the same thing.  Thus he has estranged himself from his family and friends, being content with the casual affairs and acquaintances he makes along the way, safely detached from his emotions.

Up In The Air is Ryan's life, but it is also the life of the people who are suddenly told that they are no longer required, whose years of dedicated hard work and devotion are ""downsized"" in a thin file Ryan hands them, telling them of the  meagre benefits contained therein. And those devastated people ask themselves ""what now?""  It is also a harsh look at a world where the  huge corporates have eliminated personal relationships among employers and employees, the latter being just anonymous beings to be sacked with no concern or consideration for their personal plight.  The transience and uncertainty of the work concept today is exposd in what I considered a brutal yet totally realistic way. Our future, professionally at least, is most certainly, ""up in the air"".

As part of his job, Ryan gives lectures to colleagues on how to be more effective and efficient by unburdening themselves of all that 'impedes' their lives including relatives and friends. It is a cold blooded, callous attitude which wins him fame, admiration and recognition. What surprised me, was that Ryan remained likeable and appealing as a personality. I was taken aback at the realization that this must be how these people are in real life and not the heartless monsters I envisioned.

Ryan's dream of attaining the ten million flier miles that only six people have ever achieved, is threatened when young employee, Natlie Keenan, (played by Anna Kendrick), proposes  using a teleconfrencing method to lay off employees. This will save the company millions on staff expenses so the boss is eager to put this method into practice.  Ryan Bingham is enraged as he does not believe this can realistically be successful and of course it would mean a total reversal of his one suitcase lifestyle. He takes Natalie on a what seems to be a last trip to show her first hand how the system works.  Perhaps because his own routine is threatened, he begins to see Vera Farmiga as more than a casual affair to be enjoyed when their schedules coincide.  He even asks her to accompany him to his niece's wedding as he has become sick of being the one who is always unaccompanied, with no dancing partner.

George Clooney is perfectfor the role, using his cool detachment, suave appearance and wry humour, to bring off the character of Ryan Bingham superbly. Vera Farmiga is perfect as the female version of Ryan, his female alter ego in fact. Jason Reitman successfully managed to convey the multiple levels and the subtle implications of being ""up in the air"". The film shocked me with its candid ruthlessness, it made me laugh with its humour, it depressed me with its harsh reality.  I came out of the cinema feeling as if a bucket of ice had been emptied over me.  I fear that the situations the film depicts are very much with us. There is a ray of hope which comes from the strength and support gained from our personal relationships that seem to be the only stability and certainty in life.  That was a consolation, at least.  But don't go unprepared like me who,for some reason, expected to see a light comedy.",1266710400,2,3989,4.7107913669064745
3996051,5,B002VECMB8,"Jason Reitman impresses me every time. Previous films Thank You For Smoking and Juno show his progress up to this amazing film. I'm not really a big George Clooney fan, I kind of liked him in Michael Clayton (Although I couldn't really figure out what was going on in that movie, I was watching it on my iPod with loud music blaring throughout the rest of the car), but he has a great performance in this.

Other actors impressed me, that short dude from the Hangover proved himself as a semi-dramatic actor. His part in the film is partial comedy, but he cries. Of course, he cries in The Hangover too. Hmm.

There's Jason Bateman, who I love from Arrested Development and not much else, was in there as Clooney's boss, he did a good job of being the boss that makes decisions you hate. And Anna Kendrick . . . that was a risky move. Going with an actor from Twilight isn't really the way to make an Oscar Best Picture (Winner? Fingers crossed) but she proved herself in this. And she wasn't one of the sparkly douchetes (from what I've heard. Never saw it. I try to avoid films directed at pre teen girls). Apparently, she played one of the slightly competent humans. I can't see her drinking blood anyway.

Oh! And that dude from Pineapple Expres! The guy who wouldn't die, every time they tried. He was in it too! Kinda different character, instead of an injured drug dealer he's a poor fiance of Clooney's sister. His character's sister, not his real-life sister.

They made some weird choices with the actors, but they paid off. I already saw this movie twice, and already I can't wait for the DVD. Oh, and the story. That was good. Written well. Good time for the plot. The plot's about a guy firing people for a living. Kind of depressing . . . Reitman likes characters that are . . . different. Tobacco lobbyist, pregnant teen, and firer . . . is that a word? Fireist . . . Fireman . . . they have a name for it, I just don't know it. I'll go with fireman. So the fireman is very isolated in his life, and by the end of the film has changed his view on how we should live. At the start he thinks that our lives are easier without other people, but by the end, he gains an understanding of how valuable other people are to our lives. Some of the characters he fires come back and explain how they wouldn't have survived being laid off without their family members. So he learns something. Yay! The point is, this film is great, it took risks not only with actors but with the topic itself, and they worked. So it makes a good film.",1266451200,2,2539,4.316561844863732
3996052,2,B002VECMB8,"""Up In The Air"" is a smug film. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad film but, considering it'd like to woo audiences into a kind of back-patting ""smart"" sentimentality, it certainly can't qualify as a great one.

At virtually every key moment when he could draw the audience closer, director Jason Reitman pulls away for a zing, or to regard his actors, particularly George Clooney, from a pitying, judgmental distance. Exceedingly well-paced for most of its running time - and deft for all its moving parts - its flaws are exposed in the last 15 minutes, which drenches Clooney with one bucket of cold water after another as if to say ""You see? Feel it!"" There's something indecent about a comedy doing that, self-defeating. ""Up In the Air"" appears to resent its smile, which is to say it doesn't really have one.

The premise veers toward satire without telegraphing its trajectory: Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a corporate samurai who fires people when companies don't feel like it. In the role, Ryan's a method actor, capably (and somewhat inexplicably) adjusting his persona to the newly axed sitting across the desk from him. Clooney is smooth in those scenes, canny and clever. We smile in the midst of misery; it's secretly fun to watch someone good at what they do. A murderer. A thief. A hatchet man.

Believable? Borderline. But Ryan's ""personal touch"" is juxtaposed with new sidekick Natalie (Anna Kendrick), fresh out of college with the notion of firing people over the Internet - which means Ryan will be grounded, strapped to a headset, and stuck in a cubicle. Given the timing of ""Up In The Air,"" and the economic meltdown that transpired in 2008, Natalie's ""corporate concept,"" predictably debunked in the field, is ludicrous, for one. A ""postal"" invitation, for two.

Ryan likes his life. He spends 320 days a year on the road. He enjoys an elite level of service in every airport, hotel and Hertz he enters. He's cultivated side career as motivational speaker, where he appeals to rooms of ""warriors"" like him to limit their lives to a backpack. No family. No entanglements. His parents are dead. His sisters are out of sight and mind in Wisconsin.

But female fellow-warrior Alex (Vera Farmiga) provides a complication: Seemingly unburdened like Ryan, she purrs his way into his bed with the right mix of seduction and sass; Natalie pushes Ryan further toward love by projecting her own wishes for a relationship onto Alex.

Ostensibly a film about a new, cold-hearted American economy - and, by extension, the world - the movie is actually an excoriation of the admittedly lemon-headed values of the Eighties and its offspring, the late Aughties, as children of the Reagan-era yuppie couples stride boldly - and somewhat foolishly - into the world, expecting it to shrink down to oyster size upon command, or, at the very least, the purchase of the appropriate technology and furniture. Natalie, played as a insufferable prig by Kendrick, quickly gets her wake-up call. Ryan's comeuppance marinates for the movie's running time and serves as a stunning detour to the predicted story arc.

These penalties are fine, I suppose, but what's the moral here? Work shouldn't be important? If so, why the proverbial violin scenes where Ryan and Natalie 86 blubbering, pleading employees? Is sobriety the aim? Sadness? Pointed resignation to the world at hand?

I don't think ""Up In the Air"" ever tries to figure itself out. Like Ryan, it lives in the moment, enjoying its overhead shots of various cities without minding the meaning. Consider that, in a key moment, we're meant to laugh at a lame engagement ring designed by the fiancee (Danny McBride) of Ryan's younger sister (Melanie Lynsky). The McBride character is a retread of Dermot Mulroney's idiot in ""About Schmidt."" Why is he a dope? Why is it funny that he's a dope, in a movie that makes pains to connect with ""regular folks?"" Why are small engagement rings funny? People lose their jobs - but the size of diamond remains sacrosanct?

Why are we shown scenes of Ryan lecturing sizable groups of ""backpack warriors,"" and none of him actually mingling with them? Because it's a construct. Why are they there? Who would choose to attend such a seminar? Samurai warriors? The crudest scene involves a suicide that mostly serves as a double-downer to Ryan's personal journey. Reitman wants to score cheap emotional points late in the game to catch up with the gloss that precedes it.

And the movie has gloss. It's terrifically made, its screenplay light and clever, juggling several plotlines - the road trip, the prodigal son, the caustic corporate rant, the bizarre quest of Ryan's to reach a certain number of airline miles - with speed and ease. The skill in ""Up In the Air"" trumps its emptiness in many ways; only in the movie's final act do you see the hustle begin to emerge, the sweet con of overturned, folded cards.

Farmiga is excellent as the sharp, non-committal Alex. Farmiga is comfortable being inside cold, rough characters, and she nails most of the notes she's forced to play. But she also gets off easy, and once the plot turns, you'll know why a short phone call that ends with the line ""I'm an adult"" doesn't even begin to explain the decisions Alex makes. Clooney looks thin, old. He's still a nice guy as an actor, self-aware of his charm - and how it wears off, after a moment. Some critics don't care for his sheepish notes, but I like them.

But Reitman doesn't make either Clooney or Farmiga - or Kendrick, who's awful on purpose - get messy with their emotions. The great directors know how to take a scene up to the beat, and then just past it, into a raw, furious scream of drama, delivered in caustic, brittle lines. Wilder knew how. Lumet still does. Woody Allen once did. The best Europeans have that talent. There is a moment in ""Up In the Air"" that begs for a showdown. Reitman misses it. A shame. It's a keystone to the film's flaw - that it's trapped in Movieland, without the sense to get out.",1266192000,10,6007,4.787644787644788

He spends most of his time on the road.  His job, laying people off, is not the most logical source of comedic material.

To many, the foundations of a good film are big name actors, A-list directing and a current subject.  But I have always thought that the foundation of any good film is the same as any good book: a good story based upon interesting ideas.  In that sense, the most important thing I gained by watching this movie was a keen desire to read the book upon which it was based.  I have not yet read the novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-in-the-Air/dp/B000QCSATA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up in the Air</a>&nbsp;by Walter Kirn.  But, I will soon.  Because this story is based upon extremely interesting ideas.

This is not a *one-size-fits-all* kind of a story.  This story will appeal to a certain group of people yet it is bound to polarize audiences.  The key thing you have to ask yourself before you purchase this movie is, ""Am I in the group of people that will appreciate this movie, or will I be bored with it?""  If you are looking for traditional movie entertainment, this movie is NOT for you.  It's slow, deliberate, and at times depressing.  But if you have a dark sense of humor and can appreciate films that portray life's darkness without apologies, then you will likely appreciate this movie and where it eventually leads.

About 60% of the way through this movie, I was ready to relegate this to the ""average"" category.  Sure, there were a lot of things that I loved about the movie.  I could relate to the dialogue and I could see the deeper significance that belies the story.  The paradox between isolation and freedom have seldom been dealt with so directly in a mainstream film.  And yet there were obvious problems.  It is true that some of the dialogue is trite and forced.  At times, the movie drags on, though I believe there is a purpose for that.  The point is, if you focus on any one element, it is not perfect.  In that sense, it's a lot like real life.  And in some ways, this movie captures the isolation of travelling for work better than any other that I could think of.

But then at a certain point, the movie comes together.  As far as the plot goes, the actual events that occur are all predictable.  And yet the plot is executed in an honest way.  It never feels like a plot point was added to either throw us off or to conform to a clich.  It feels more like a recounting than a telling of a story, which is the best compliment a dark comedy can receive.

I love the cast of this movie, though to be honest none of them were given tremendously great lines when looked at as individual parts.  This movie is really more than a sum of its parts.

While the core plot is very well structured, there are story elements that I might have done differently.  Some of the politically incorrect dialogue given to Clooney's character seems forced.  Yet the story is strong enough to overcome those small things.  By the end of the film, the things that were annoying in the beginning become after-thoughts.

CONCLUSION

Overall, I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would.  I plan on gifting it to like-minded road-warriors with similarly dark humor.  This is one of those stories where both the criticism and the praise have elements of truth to them.  You will have to determine if it's the right kind of movie for you.

3996054,3,B002VECMB8,"""Up in the Air"" had all the ingredients to be a great film: accomplished director and writer, talented actors, a clever and timely topic. And yet something feels amiss in this film, as though it came so close to the mark but just didn't quite make it.

George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a man whose job entails flying about the country laying off employees because their bosses don't want to do the dirty work themselves. Ryan is a man who is detached from everyone in his life, and is convinced that he doesn't have a need for human connection and interaction. Throughout the film, two things happen: first, he is forced to take on a young trainee (Natalie Keener, played by Anna Kendrick) and show her his business, and second, he meets Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) a fellow professional traveler with whom he begins a relationship. The film follows these characters as they connect and disconnect and try to make sense of one another.

The characters are compelling, and at times the film is poignant, but overall the whole is not greater than its parts. Perhaps part of the problem was the feeling that two stories were being told: the first act of the film focuses on Natalie and her travels with Ryan, and then Natalie disappears for much of the second act, which centers around Ryan and Alex. Both stories are compelling, but they don't fit together very well, and as a result neither feels like it received proper treatment. This is not to say that films must end well-resolved and clear-cut; this is not the case. Nevertheless the characters in the film should undergo some sort of arc, and I'm forced to question whether the characters here were given enough time to have an arc, or if their stories were cut short but trying to fit too much into one film. The story for the most part is engaging, though it is often predictable and occasionally tedious, and I wonder if it couldn't have been a more nuanced film.

This is not to say ""Up in the Air"" is a bad film -- it is not by any means. It is fun (albeit depressing) and Clooney and Farmiga are both excellent in their roles. Director Jason Reitman is an accomplished filmmaker, though next to his past efforts, ""Juno"" and ""Thank You For Smoking,"" ""Up in the Air"" is his weakest film.

Perhaps my expectations were set too high by all of the acclaim and hype the movie received, but it is my belief that this film had the potential to be far greater than it was. It is certainly worth a watch, but something about it doesn't quite add up.",1265846400,19,2497,4.517699115044247
3996055,2,B002VECMB8,"""Up in the Air"" is primarily a long advertisement for American Airlines, Hertz Rent-A-Car, and Hilton Hotels. It also wasn't funny watching a sophomoric approach to firing people - especially by gutless managers that couldn't do it themselves. (I've never heard of that in reality.) Finally, the movie would have been more credible if George Clooney had been fired in the end, after his associates' ""Go To Meeting"" Internet no-travel approach had been institutionalized. At least she had the sense to move on with her life, leaving Clooney to return to being a lonely drag on society. I can't believe this movie is being considered for an award!",1265673600,3,645,4.981481481481482

Moreover, if you take a glimpse around the last sixty years, you will be notice how modest has been this season in which the originality and creativity glitter for their absence.

The personal record of this executive has been reached: Ten millions miles in the air. But beneath the curious anecdote, there's a lonely man who has wrought a peculiar life philosophy: to live without hindrances or emotional ties.

Meanwhile, three facts will make its appearance in order to alterate his habitual way of life: he will meet another female executive who lives a similar life, on the other hand, a young woman tries to follow his steps as executive (but fails in her attempt) and besides, his own sister is going to be married and he is invited for her wedding.

The emotional impact of this marriage will make think and reflect about his existential profile, far beyond all the successes and achieved goal.

Two previous films have remarked and inspired this one: Lost in Tokyo and Amelie.

In sum, a dramatic comedy that in honor to the truth has been overrated, due the proposed idea promised much more. To be honest, the film doesn't match the status to be nominated as Best Film.

3996057,5,B002VECMB8,"Jason Reitman (director and co-writer with Sheldon Turner based on Walter Kirn's novel of the same name)  is a bright light among the new directors of important stature.  He has a style: he makes comedy films touching on serious matters (JUNO deals with teen pregnancy, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING deals with the dangers of tobacco); his films open with significant and elaborate sequences; his main characters offer highly subjective narrations and tend to be self-confident people who end up re-thinking their lives; he tends to favor continued using of a troupe of ensemble actors (here JK Simmons, Sam Elliott, James Bateman).  UP IN THE AIR shares all of these traits and more.  It dares to talk about firing people in a time when everyone in this country is frightened about the job market and somehow manages to show the compassion for both the victims and the perpetrators. It is a challenge of the first order and Reitman makes it work very well.  This is not a feel good comedy; this is a drama with comic relief that addresses serious issues and people's responses to them - employment, relationships, marriage, and apparent self-sufficiency.

Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) spends his time in the air, flying to companies across the USA whose CEOs don't want the job of informing employees they are no longer needed.  Ryan manages to make these encounters as human as possible and he is an artist in his work. His personal life is rather arid: his love needs are met by women on the run, he has distanced himself from his family, electing to maintain a sterile one room apartment in Omaha which he uses the few days out of the year when he is not flying. He meets a very beautiful, smart, and seductive woman Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and a crazy courtship ensues as they meet in different cities  - both being traveling business people.

Things change when Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman) takes on a fresh graduate student with big ideas for reducing the costs of the company.  Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is smart, a focused designer of telecommunications who has sold Craig on the idea of doing the firing remotely rather than spending the money to fly Ryan et al around the country. Ryan bristles and demands that Natalie accompany him on his personalized interview firings before the company goes Skype.  The two - Ryan and Natalie - are paired for an excursion of real life jobs terminations and both learn from each other.  Ryan continues to have trysts with Alex and eventually Ryan, Alex and Natalie party together.  Natalie discovers the human side of Ryan's work and finds the person to person contact difficult.  At the same time Natalie challenges Ryan's inability to form realistic relationships with women.  Hurtful things happen to each to the three fliers, causing each to re-think their career goals as well as their personal needs.

Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick deliver first class performances (very obviously Oscar worthy), but then so do the many cameo actors in the film: Amy Morton, Melanie Lynsky and Danny McBride as Ryan's needy family, and a long list of very brief but deeply moving cameos of people being fired by an extraordinary group of actors (casting director Mindy Marin deserves an Oscar also).  The gorgeous cinematography is by Eric Steelberg and the music score is by Rolfe Kent (with a special nod to the composer and singer and guitar player who ends the movie credits with a song that summarizes the ideas of the film).  And shining over all of these factors is the superlative, flawless direction of Jason Reitman.  This film may have unpopular themes, but it is most assuredly on of the best films of 2009.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, February 10",1265500800,12,3709,4.855555555555555
3996058,4,B002VECMB8,"George Clooney stars in this well done character study written and directed by Juno director Jason Reitman. It touches on things like the cold and clinical world of Corporate America, self-imposed isolation and self examination.

Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man working for a company that is contracted by various other companies around the country to be more or less hatchetmen and fire employees when the client company's own executives are too chicken to do it themselves. Confused? Of course, it's Corporate America, what do you expect? Ryan flies all over the country going from one corporate office to another giving out the pink slips. His job is to master the technique of making it easy for the target employee. In the film's beginning, we see a collage of a variety of reactions from the employees, the crying, the anger and in a hilarious cameo by The Hangover's Zach Galifianakis, that rare occurence of an employee who decides to arm himself.

Ryan has become quite content with his work and has become quite good at it as well. But he's not really content at firing people, he's content at the fact that all this constant traveling allows him to escape any possible serious comittment with anyone. He has a philosophy of being free of permanent relationships that he preaches at seminars on the side. This philosophy is put to the test when he encounters two women, an up and coming young co-worker who has her own thoughts on relationships, and a fellow traveler Ryan meets and developes a casual relationship with only to later discover a startling revelation about her. This makes him have second thoughts on his own philosophy. Both women are played by Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga (The Departed) respectfully.

The film is well done with acting kudos to the whole cast, but the real stand out to me is newcomer Anna Kendrick. She's up for an Oscar on this one, and I won't be surprised if she gets it. Reitman's quirky rapid editing direction fits well with the film along with some great cinematography.

All in all, this is a good character study that probes into why some people choose to isolate themselves even in the most crowded environment. I always like a film that can make you think and this one certainly does. Chalk up another winner for Reitman.",1265500800,,2282,4.784263959390863

All throughout the movie I was expecting the obvious conclusion (the firer being fired) and was surprised to get something completely different in return, but even UP IN THE AIR's schocker scene, managed to make so much sense it's hard for me to understand how I didn't see it coming.

Plus the supporting characters are also well drawn out and performed to perfection by Anne Kendricks, Vera Farmiga, J.K. Simmons and Danny McBride.

3996063,4,B002VECMB8,"It is certainly ironic that a film like ""Up in the Air"" should coincide with the global financial crisis and a very serious recession the United States.  Ironic, because the lead role of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a hired gun.  He travels for 322 days a year firing people on behalf of downsizing companies.

Clooney is wonderful in this role.  He is cool, calm and manages to remain detached from the raw emotions that can be provoked as part of the process of ""letting people go"".  Yet, for all his skill, he is marked for downsizing himself as a young woman in the office develops the idea of firing people online.  Instantly, travel and associated costs are eliminated.  But, so too is Bingham's very life style.  He lives for the life on the road and its privileges and anonymity.  He dreads having to return to his ""home town"" of Omaha.  Here, he keeps only a very modest apartment.  After all, nine days in ten sees him travelling.

In his travels, Bingham comes across Alex (Vera Farmiga) who seems in a strange way to be his soul mate.  Ah, but there is more than meets the eye with Alex.  She has her own secrets which, in due course, are stumbled upon by Bingham.

""Up in the Air"" is a surprisingly good film.  It is deeper that I might have thought.  It is also funny and touching.  Perhaps George Clooney has been type cast.  This is a shame.  He is a very good actor and this role suits him admirably.",1264204800,,1421,4.413127413127413

It starts off ok enough Clooney in cruise control playing George Clooney just like every other film he is in. Then oh oh trout pout love interest Vera Farmiga shows up - with the worst body double you have ever seen for the nude scene - and the film becomes yet another sappy rom-com.

But what makes this worse is that while it tries to take itself seriously regarding lay-offs, unemployment, love marriage, whats the point of it all blah blah - it runs off down the buddy movie path with that old clich of the old pro (Clooney) and the young eager but green new recruit ( Anna Kendrick ) who Clooney takes under his wing and guides her through the job while she helps him become a better person.

Oh dear how many movies have tread this wearisome path. Not interesting not funny not particularly well acted - how on earth did this get such glowing reviews from the critics?",1264118400,10,953,4.318435754189944
3996065,5,B002VECMB8,"Having flown >55k/yr for 4+yrs, I personally understand Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) world: Blackberry in hand, efficiently filling grey TSA bins, hotel key cards as home key, snatching a boarding pass from a kiosk while by-passing non-Elite, living a week from rolling luggage, laptop on hotel WiFi, hotel shuttle as one's commute, and satellite offices as one's ""home"" office. These images of what people hate about travel are truly fond reminders of a frequent flyer's home. His Omaha office's and corporate apartment's sparseness both prove his fear of not being on the move. The camera carefully but quickly frames each fleeting postcard from the frequent flyer's world. Their world is not just a dream but a daily reality briefly hinted to some and lived by only a few.

Warning: frequent fliers expecting a rehash of their lives and loves will be disappointed. The movie must venture into emotional drama thus is not a documentary about high mileage.

Stereotypes of men as emotionally unavailable simpletons fall under Ryan's admissions of growing loneliness and desire to see someone more than once: his casual hotel fling, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Ryan's purposefully designed world of emotional isolation, as many mature male knows, is unsustainable. Attending his sister's wedding pangs his conscience. His loyal partner/fling saves Ryan from a potentially lonely event. Life is a tease: we just want to be loved and to love.

New hire Natalie Keener's (Anna Kendrick) proposal of firing via videoconferencing grounds Ryan's high-flying ambitions. Her Ivy League psychology degree belies her chilly exterior, each glance able to efficiently e-fire an anonymous worker bee. Ryan's boss charges him with tour guiding Natalie through in-person firings on the road. Beyond the comedy of Natalie's new-to-flying hiccups is the familiar notion that coworkers become adopted families. Work experiences become unexpected opportunities to share personal revelations not told to even (or especially) family members. Personal, private turmoils burst into one's professional life. Work and life blur as working hours lengthen, as business travel forces ad hoc families.

The movie's purposeful shift to a ponderous ending comes after a series of unexpected turns. Emotional isolation becomes impossible. A family crisis undoes his intentional emotional distance from them. Each firing brings Ryan closer to his own firing. The trainee becomes the trainer. The unfamiliar world of frequent flying becomes too familiar. The theme song ""Help Yourself"" sarcastically toasts the new economy. This movie has its pulse on our lives. Widespread acclaim of the movie is thanks to its balancing a fun lifestyle which is based on true stories which relate to our lives: emotionally isolating 1-night stands, unforgivingly impersonal corporate climate, travel as general burden, and family rifts growing and healing. The movie covers much ground without ever leaving home ... pun intended.",1263945600,3,2982,5.490196078431373
3996066,4,B002VECMB8,"From the director of ""Thank you for smoking"" and ""Juno"" comes another film called Up in the air. The film has been shot all over USA but yet what you get to see are yachts and getaway planes. You see airports, hotels, offices and you see people waiting in lines offended about some jerk who just cut them off in the line because he has special privileges. That jerk is played masterfully by George Clooney who's style of acting I'm finally starting to like. Vera Farmiga played a good co-star and the other actors, I don't know their names so I won't bother.

In this film, Clooney shines as Ryan Bingham, a 40 something hedonist who is very good at his job and packing his luggage. The editing is sharp and the soundtrack was good.  I won't bother explaining his job but I can tell you one thing, this is one of those few films which are a little better than what the trailer offers. I don't think we can call this is an indie film because the subject matter is unique. I wondered how the film would end halfway through it. The dialogues are very entertaining and humorous without being fashionably dark.

The only thing that surprised me was how I was the only person in the house-full AMC audi who clapped much to everyone's smiling displeasure. Do not miss this film, watch it on the big screen before they take it off. Some very good acting, good characters, good music and heavy handed end. This film has it all.

3996067,5,B002VECMB8,"It seems a bit strange, even sacrilegious to say that a film about people losing their jobs is a great film, funny and moving. But ""Up In The Air"", the new film from writer - director Jason Reitman (""Juno"", ""Thank You For Smoking"") is a very good (great?) film deftly mixing comedy, funny and dark, with real human emotions and familiar situations. Starring George Clooney,"" Air"" is a film to watch when the Awards season begins.

Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) plays a man who lives on airplanes; Ryan works for a company who hires him out to travel around the country and fire people who are being laid off. Basically, he does the dirty work for people who are too afraid to do it themselves. He spends so much time in airports, on airplanes, and in chain hotels, these have become his new home. He prefers these places to his actual apartment in Omaha and dreads returning there. He also has a goal. He wants to earn a coveted award from his airline of choice for flying more than a million miles. Then, his boss (Jason Bateman) tells him they have just hired a new college graduate, Natalie (Anna Kendrick, ""Twilight"") who has come up with a revolutionary way for them to do their job, through teleconferencing. But before they implement this plan, he wants Natalie to travel with Ryan, to learn the ropes. Ryan meets another fellow traveler, Alex (Vera Farmiga) who seems equally at home in airports and hotels. They hook up and realize they want to meet as often as possible. Both of these women begin to change the way Ryan thinks. But is it too late for him to change his life?

It is almost amazing how accomplished and interesting the short career of director Jason Reitman has been. Sure, he is the son of mega-director Ivan (of ""Ghostbusters"" fame), but Jason's films have shown a remarkable amount of talent, skill and thought. His first film, ""Thank You For Smoking"" is a scathing, very funny satire about lobbyists. His second, ""Juno"", propelled Ellen Page to stardom and earned some Awards buzz. Now, with ""Up In The Air"", the director has created his most accomplished, introspective, meaningful and interesting film yet. ""Air"" is sure to be a contender for many awards in the next few months.

Reitman's ""Air"" is the story of a man who travels across country and fires people for a living. And because of this, Ryan Bingham is basically an unlikable guy, which isn't a bad thing at all, but it is a strange thing to find in a major studio release. And a lot of credit for our interest in watching Ryan's journey has to go to Clooney. We get a feeling for Bingham, who he is, what he is, why he is, all of which is illustrated very succinctly in a voice over from Ryan. Ryan seems to revel in the world he has created for himself. Always on the move, always in another airplane, another hotel room. At one point, Ryan swipes a frequent customer card and announces to us the employee is programmed to great him in a specific way. The way Ryan (and Clooney) tells us about this barely hides the frequent flyer's pleasure at having reached such a lofty level of business with this other corporation. While this reveals a lot about Ryan's business dealings to us, it also shows a lot about his character. He seems to revel in the fact that some anonymous woman, who could care less about him (and vice versa) has to greet him in a specific way. This is what constitutes a relationship in his world and he is all the happier for it. And of course, we can see how shallow and empty his world is, so we feel more than a little empathy for him. All of these feelings come flooding through us even as we begin to have opposite feelings towards him, because we can't forget he goes around firing people, taking their livelihood from them.

But as soon as these conflicts start to stir within us, they quickly disappear. We start to like Ryan and care for him. If he didn't do this job, someone else would. And he doesn't seem to revel in the actual details of the job; he seems to try to be as empathetic to the people around him as possible. Someone else would probably be less kind to the unfortunate souls.

Clooney's performance seems effortless and this makes Ryan seem all the more viable a person. And because of this, I have no doubt he will be nominated for a slew of awards in the next few weeks.

Wisely, Reitman does a very interesting thing to help make Ryan all the more human. Ryan's boss (Jason Bateman) introduces Natalie (Anna Kendrick ""New Moon"", ""Twilight"") as a new hotshot college graduate with some great ideas. And soon, the idea is revealed. If they start to do their job through teleconferencing, the company will save a lot of money on airfare, hotels, etc. This will effectively ground Ryan, causing him to panic slightly. But he also realizes physically sitting in front of someone they are firing helps the situation. Sure, it is a crappy situation to begin with, but firing people long distance isn't going to help an already bad situation get any better. This is illustrated when they give the new system a trial run.

In a way, they make Natalie even worse than Ryan and this helps to make Ryan more likable.

Natalie and Ryan take a road trip together, to give Natalie some real world experience before the company fully adopts her plan. This trip becomes a growing experience for the recent college grad as Ryan tries to impart everything he has learned to her.

One night, Ryan meets Alex (Vera Farmiga) at the hotel he is staying at. They have dinner, drinks and start to flirt over who has better Executive Rewards Cards. Ryan recognizes a kindred spirit and they really get along well, so they start to try to plan their schedules around when they can hook up together. The more they see each other, the more attracted they become and Ryan begins to question his existence, everything he has set-up for his life.

The more we see and live with Ryan, the more we grow to like him, the more we grow to accept him.

Reitman also uses a bunch of actual people who were recently fired as the victims of Ryan and Natalie's work. This gives the entire film a greater resonance and makes it seem more personal. Each of the real people reportedly gives the same response they gave when they were actually fired. These people are presented in a couple of quick montages giving us an overview of what Ryan does everyday, how many people he has to deal with, how many negative reactions and what has led him to become slightly numb but also horrified at Natalie's new plans.

This sums up what makes ""Up In The Air"" so successful. Most of the things in the film, the characters, the story, their actions, the places they go, have at least two sides. Reitman and his cast and crew show us both, and this helps make everything more interesting and real.

3996068,4,B002VECMB8,"Sometimes karma can be a real b***h.  Take Ryan Bingham, who works for a company that specializes in firing other companies' employees.  Yet, despite the harshness of what he's paid to do, Ryan genuinely loves his job and the confirmed-bachelor lifestyle it allows him to lead.  He loves being away from home 270 days out of the year.  He loves flying on planes - to the point where he's about to crack the magical 10 million-mile mark on his Frequent Flyer plan.  He even loves the place he officially calls home: a sterile motel room in Omaha where he barely gets time to shower and shave and unpack his bags before heading off to another destination.

The problem is that all these business trips are placing an onerous financial burden on the company.  The solution the bigwigs have come up with is to simply remove the human-contact element from the firing process altogether and replace it with the impersonality of the dreaded teleconference.  For Ryan, this means that his days of flying the friendly skies may well be numbered.  Before that happens, however, Ryan is determined to make one last stand with his boss, agreeing to take Natalie Keener, the young woman who came up with the idea, on the road with him to demonstrate just how crucially important the ""personal-touch"" can be when terminating an employee.  Meanwhile, despite his avowals about how much he loves the bachelor life, a crack in his armor may be starting to show, for Ryan may in fact be falling for Alex, a 30-something fellow-traveler he meets in a bar one night and with whom he begins an initially ""casual,"" typically no-strings-attached romance.  But will it stay that way?

""Up in the Air"" is the latest work by Jason Reitman, the director who gave us ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno"" in recent years.  Like those earlier efforts, ""Up in the Air"" is a subtle, thought-provoking comedy/drama that explores not only the complexities of romance and human relationships but the destructive effect rampant corporate downsizing has on the shell-shocked individuals who are its victims and on the fabric of society as a whole.

Reitman is scrupulously evenhanded in his depiction of the protagonist.  Ryan may not crave an ongoing relationship with that one ""special"" individual, but he doesn't inflict his values on other people and doesn't expect everyone to agree with how he lives his life.  For Ryan, living alone is simply a lifestyle choice that seems to be working for him.  He isn't even particularly callous in the way he treats those he's in the process of lowering the employment-ending boom on.  Ryan knows that someone has to do his job and it might as well be him.  It certainly beats doing it in the new highly impersonal way Natalie has come up with.  The cosmic question becomes is Ryan's eternal bachelor mindset truly endemic to his personality, or could he find true happiness with another person if he just gave it the old college try?

Reitman's wryly humorous screenplay (co-authored with Sheldon Turner and based on the book by Walter Kim) explores Ryan's relationship - one platonic, the other not - with two women:  the brash but actually quite nave Natalie who, despite her seeming emotional detachment, believes in happily-ever-after storybook endings and long-term marital bliss, and the more seasoned Alex who has few illusions about what life has to offer in either of those two regards.  The movie hears out all sides on the issue without casting judgment and without settling for easy answers.  For that very reason, the movie also earns points for refusing to cater to the audience's expectations for a stereotypical, copout ending.

As Ryan, George Clooney really makes his rugged good looks and laid back charm work for him in this role, and Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga, as the two women in his life, match him every step of the way in their performances.

Given the hard economic times in which we live, ""Up in the Air"" could not be more topical in its treatment of unemployment and the devastating effect it has on the people who suffer the ravages of it.  The movie may not blow you away as other social dramas do, but it will get you to thinking about your own life - and provide you with a few good laughs to lighten the load.",1263340800,,4253,4.774590163934426

George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a hatchet man for hire, traveling the country delivering the bad news to employees whose own bosses are too spineless to do the deed themselves.

He enjoys his job of delivering bad news to folks with a human touch, but with no desire to spend more than ten minutes of his life with them.  There is some hope for Bingham developing into an actual human being, via a relationship with another travel addicted businesswoman Alex(played perfectly by Vera Farmiga) but that is dashed when Bingham discovers that the road warrior has a family back at home in Chicago.

This is NOT a family movie.  There are some incredibly vulgar scenes, and some brief nudity.  I watched this with my wife and mother-in-law and the scene where Bingham is exchanging text messages with his fling, Alex made me more than a little uncomfortable.  It was filthy, and unnecessary.

This movie is about the exploration of a philosophy- that of rootless hedonism.  What is community?  What is home?  What makes us human?  It is our relationships with  others that define us, and this movie shows us what a completely pompous jerk a man can be when he has none of those ties.

The soundtrack is exceptional, and as with Reitman's other films, worth putting in your collection even before the DVD of the film itself.",1263081600,,1782,4.67524115755627
3996070,5,B002VECMB8,"I was not a fan of Jason Reitman's last film, the over-hyped ""Juno,"" but I thought I'd enjoy ""Up in the Air"" based on the cast and premise.  Indeed, ""Up in the Air"" is far superior to the self-conscious ""Juno;"" in fact, it's one of the best dramedies in recent years.  The perfectly cast George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, who works for an Omaha-based company that fires people for other companies.  He terminates employees all over the country, so he spends most of his times ""up in the air"" travelling to different cities.  For him, traveling isn't just a job - it's a lifestyle - and he remains firmly rootless, which means avoiding relationships as well.  Eventually, he meets a beautiful fellow frequent flyer (Vera Farmiga) with whom he develops a ""no strings"" relationship.  They meet up whenever they happen to be in the same city for business.  Bingham is forced to examine his life, though, when his company threatens to pull him off the road and then saddles him for his final trips with a young newcomer (Anna Kendrick).

""Up in the Air"" is a timely movie that taps into the apprehension so many people currently have about possibly being fired, and it speaks to the death knell of the concept of people working for the same company their entire lives.  The air of chilly detachment the movie invokes captures this post-9/11 era of financial uncertainty, with Bingham the model of professional and emotional detachment.  The movie manages to be darkly funny, perhaps because so much of it strikes a chord, often in a painful way.  Incidentally, if the segments of people being fired often seem real, it's because Reitman put ads in newspapers recruiting people who had recently been laid off and claimed that it was for a documentary.  He filmed them discussing their experiences and then asked them to re-enact their firing!

Reitman wrote each part with the current cast in mind, and the actors really deliver.  Clooney's brand of sexy aloofness is ideal for the role, and Farmiga has never been better as his equally chilly ""girlfriend.""  The two have been racking up award nominations, including the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards.  I wasn't very familiar with Anna Kendrick previously, but she is also very good as the young somewhat shrill hotshot who is paired with Clooney.  She also has received numerous award nominations and is considered a lock for an Oscar nomination.  Ultimate credit for the movie, though, goes to Reitman, who has shown tremendous growth since ""Juno.""  His direction is amazing and the script, adapted from a 2001 novel by Walter Kirn, is easily the best of the year; I particularly admire how it refuses to take the easy way out.  The only thing I didn't like about the film is the sometimes twee soundtrack which sometime undercuts the drama of the situations.  Otherwise, ""Up in the Air"" signals the maturation of a major directing talent.",1262995200,3,2901,4.831983805668016
3996071,5,B002VECMB8,"Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) likes his unencumbered lifestyle--as a corporate downsizing consultant, he spends most of the year traveling across the country, breaking the news to the formerly employed that their positions are ""no longer available"" and ""preparing"" them for the next stage of their life by handing them a packet.  A number of events conspire to cause him to reevaluate his life: he is assigned the task of showing the ropes to a young up-and-comer (Anna Kendrick) who wants to rock his industry, he meets a woman (Vera Farmiga) that he actually wants to spend more time with, and a sister (Melanie Lynskey) he rarely sees decides to get married.

This perceptive film about life, work, and the deep insecurities we all feel in these precarious economic times reminds us to cherish the people in our lives.  It is interesting that such a famously confirmed bachelor as Clooney stars in such a paean to the comforts of married life--sort of an ""only Nixon could go to China"" situation.

George Clooney plays a man who loves his isolation, traveling, and his job--firing people. The current economy has made that aspect of the film a relevant topic, but it's only an aspect of the film. It's mostly about growing up and figuring out what you want from life. ""Up In The Air"" gives an interesting character study and is written in such a way that the ending should have you talking; it is by no standards a bad film--just an overrated one.",1262908800,2,613,4.339130434782609

Great flick, but beware Up in the Air will leave you down in the dumps. George Clooney plays corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham and his job is to travel around the country and hand out pink slips to the sad and sometimes disgruntled corporate employee. If that isn't depressing enough, Clooney will make it even tougher on you, the moviegoer, as he plays his part so well that you actually begin to feel sorry for him. There are great lines in the movie and chances are you will find yourself laughing out loud on more than one occasion.

3996077,5,B002VECMB8,"Son of acclaimed director/producer Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Stripes), Jason Reitman was born into a life of filmmaking. Even his first kiss took place in front of the camera during a scene of his father's movie, Kindergarten Cop.  After launching a career of his own with the critically acclaimed films, Thank You for Smoking and Juno, Reitman is quickly establishing himself as one of the most talented and unique directors working today. None of his films follow any of the conventional Hollywood formulas; they tackle real-life issues head-on in a smart and genuine fashion, yet are always tagged with his dry and witty sense of humor. With Up in the Air, only his third film, Jason Reitman seems to already be at the top of his game.

 George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, whose job is to be, more or less, the bearer of bad news. His company employs him to fly around the country and lay off workers for companies who are too afraid to do it themselves. He also, on occasion, is hired as a motivational speaker where he preaches his message that the only way live life is to void yourself of all relationships and emotional attachments.  They are, as he puts, ""the heaviest components of your life.""

Being on the road for over 300 days of the year, Ryan practices what he preaches. He has mastered the art of flying and manages to have little possessions outside of his suitcase and his only people he stays in contact with are his sisters, but even talking with them is a rare occurrence. He recognizes names and faces of flight attendants, but the small talk with them on a flight or a one-night stand in a hotel are the extent of his interactions with people.
Ryan soon finds himself challenged by an up and coming employee, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who has created and easier and more efficient method for firing people that would essential make his position obsolete. He also meets a lady friend along the way (Vera Farmiga) who is essentially a female version of him and seems to be the first person in a long time he actually connects to. Both of them force him to reflect upon his life and make him question whether not one can go on in this world without forming any serious relationships.

One of the many things that make this film so great is the remarkable on-screen chemistry between Clooney and Farmiga. It is so natural and effortless that one can only hope that this isn't the last time we see them work together. Each of their performances here are near-locks for Oscar nominations. Reitman's directing is spot-on, as well. He seems confident and assured as ever behind the camera. To make a film this good so early in his career shows limitless potential as a director.  An Oscar for Best Director seems inevitable for him at some point.

Despite originally being written years earlier, other projects prevented him from releasing this until now. Ironically enough, this delay may have helped the film out, as its release comes during one of the worst economic downturns in American history. This film will no doubt hit home for anyone who has last his or her job recently or has had a loved that's suffered a similar fate.

With a cast of A-list actors each at the top of their game, and a director who knows exactly what to do with them, Up in the Air proves to be a perfect reflection of the current social and political climate in America and is easily one the best pictures to be released this year, of not the best. Jason Reitman may only be 32 years old, but he may have just created his masterpiece.

3996078,4,B002VECMB8,"Up in the Air is that rare film where you don't know what's going to happen at the end.  I was all set to believe, for example, that George Clooney, after firing 17,000 workers, would wind up fired himself: that would be the way Richard Yates would have played it.  Finally I realized how director Jason Reitman was harvesting all this narratological surprise.  Basically the film is two different movies, each with its own story, and the stories are chopped up and intersected with each other to provide a jolt of surprise from time to time.  The first story is the high concept story, Clooney as Ryan Bingham who makes it his business to fire innocent people, hired almost as a mercenary by companies whose executives lack the balls to make the cuts themselves.  I don't know what you all made of this storyline, but I found all of the characters involved morally repellent, soulless.  They were funny (Jason Bateman), charming (Clooney), lovably young and insecure (Anna Kendrick, as the Cornell graduate with a new vision for firing people more cheaply), but all of them disgusted me.  I guess that's ok in a movie, who wants a film with a bunch of goody two shoes, but are any of them redeemed at the end?  To do that you'd have to redeem the whole capitalist system of profit trumping everything.

At the same time as we register discomfort with what Bingham does, we are encouraged to envy him his ten million miles and his Concierge card from American made out of graphite.  It's so rare people doubt it exists!  But we see it in action.  When he comes towards them, people in slavery to American must bow down to him and greet him warmly.  Fake warmth that Bingham recognizes, and yet he seems to enjoy--well, who wouldn't.  Yes, the perks of his position are what it's all about.

The second story is that of George Clooney (Ryan Bingham) as a man who has not let himself be vulnerable enough to love.  That's the more appealing story, and perhaps the more familiar.  We see him let his guard down with the elegant, beautiful Vera Farmiga, a woman as expert with airline schedules as he.  I liked all of this story, but it's as old as Hollywood itself.  We saw it with Clark Gable and Greer Garson 60 years ago, it's as old as time.

The movie shows you don't need fifty million dollars worth of CGI to tell an entertaining tale, but after leaving the theater I felt a huge number of qualms about the admittedly risky nature of the story I had just seen and I wasn't sure how I felt--that's a good thing, right?  The use of real people playing the people fired by Bingham--clever, but ultimately exploitative?  Or vice versa?",1261872000,,2635,4.549893842887474
3996079,4,B002VECMB8,"Up in the Air is an excellent film. It's never dull, well-acted and satisfying in that certain way. You know the one. It goes something like this:

""Gawd, I'm just so glad to finally see a film that's actually intelligent and doesn't make me cringe. ""

It's kind of sad we have to set the bar for a good film so pathetically low. Intelligence shouldn't be rare like diamonds in the movie theater. But it is.

If there's anything wrong with the film, it's just too pat. Too safe. The plot twists are predictable, the ending one of many potentialities the reasonably smart movie-goer will at least fleetingly consider long before the credits roll. And because of that I can't call this movie great with a capital G. It's merely very good.

And given how rare ""merely very good"" happens to be these days, I'll take it whenever I can get it.",1261785600,,837,4.4868421052631575
3996080,5,B002VECMB8,"I was completely blown away by ""Up in the Air,"" which is an outstanding film and possibly George Clooney's best performance yet. (Oscar buzz, anyone?)

The movie stars Clooney as Ryan Bingham, a man who makes a living traveling around the country to fire random people in place of bosses who don't have the guts to do the dirty work themselves. Ryan has lived out of a suitcase for years and is perfectly content with that. However, he is suddenly faced with two major hurdles. First of all, his company decides to start managing mass layoffs via video conferencing, which threatens Ryan's up in the air lifestyle. Also, Ryan meets a woman, Alex (Vera Farmiga), whom he actually begins to develop feelings for, which really throws him for a loop.

This movie combines a brilliant screenplay that tackles very difficult and personal subject matters with a fantastic cast. In addition to Clooney and Farmiga, ""Up in the Air"" features stellar performances by Anna Kendrick (famous for her role as ditzy Jessica in the ""Twilight"" saga) and Jason Bateman (known for roles in ""Juno"" and the ""Arrested Development' television series0. The film mixes painful emotions of loss and loneliness with tender and often humorous moments. The result is a very touching film that is timely during this country's recession, and which forces the audience to take a close look at their own lives and reacess their priorities.

""Up in the Air"" is one of the best films of 2009, hands-down. This is definitely a movie worth seeing.",1261785600,,1509,4.88671875
3996081,5,B002VECMB8,"I don't get to travel nearly as much as I'd like to. I'd love it if I could go to a new city every few months, fly to places I've never been, see all the sites, and all that good stuff. That said, I don't know that I'd want to travel as much as the main character of Jason Reitman's latest film, Up in the Air, an isolated, rootless man whose goal is to reach 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles.

George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man who is on the road over 300 days a year. He's a master business traveler, who knows all the ins and outs of how to get through security quickly, how to get extra miles and comments on the fact that his goal of reaching 10 million miles is one accomplished by only six other people, which is less than the number of people who have walked on them Moon.

He lives in airports, first class lounges and airplanes. He has an actual apartment near his home office in Omaha, but it's even more sterile and impersonal than the hotels he stays in.

Bingham travels mostly for work, and his job is one I'd not heard of before: he goes to companies that are too gutless to actually fire people and does it for them. He does it in a firm, but not entirely impersonal, way and is very good at his job, and is appalled when he finds out that his company plans to ground him and everyone else and start firing people over the internet.

This is one of the most adult movies I've seen, and by that I don't mean that it's filled with violence, sex or anything like that. No, I mean that it's a movie that's made by adults, for adults. It explores adult relationships from a very adult angle. You don't see lots of big hysterics or grand romantic gestures (and the only attempt at one of those backfires). You just adults being adults.

Everything about this movie works and works well. The acting is excellent, the directing is top notch, the writing is fresh and intelligent. A particularly nice touch is that the establishing shots showing places like Kansas City and Wichita are done from an airplane looking down, as though one were a passenger. It's a nice touch.

This is a completely entertaining and fascinating film. I fully expect it to get several Oscar nominations and rightly so. This is one great movie!",1261785600,,2235,4.360576923076923
3996082,5,B002VECMB8,"Up In the Air mixes romantic comedy with a portrait of these harsh economic times; and it comes up a winner because it does a good job exploring both themes without being either superficial or maudlin. There is fine character development and superb acting, too. The plot moves along quite well and I was never once bored. The cinematography was wonderful--I especially liked those aerial shots of the cities and the plains as seen from an airplane above. The choreography works equally well, too. The script was very well written and its use of real people, not actors, expressing what they felt when they were fired in real life adds to the quality of this film.

When the film starts, we quickly meet corporate road warrior Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) whose life is actually so empty that his only real relationships are with American Airlines, Hertz and the Hilton hotel chain. Indeed, Ryan's only real goal for himself is to travel so much that he's earned ten million frequent flyer miles! Ryan's job is to fly to cities where there are companies with bosses too afraid to fire their employees when downsizing; Ryan is the guy who gets paid to take the heat from someone who might become crazed or worse when they find out that they've been terminated from their job. Things are actually going well for Ryan who doesn't seem to mind his really rough job, but then his boss brings in a newcomer who wants to completely change the game plan. Young, snooty and recent graduate upstart Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) wants to do away with the road warriors--and save the company 85% of its expenses by terminating people using webcams! Of course, this jeopardizes Ryan's own job, so he offers to take Natalie on the road with him ostensibly to ""show her the ropes.""

Meanwhile, Ryan begins a relatively light-hearted, pleasure for the sake of just fun relationship with a female road warrior, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Ryan slowly but surely warms up to her; Alex becomes the first person Ryan's ever even considered reaching out to for a meaningful relationship. Ryan's emotional life has been so empty that when he mentions he's attending the wedding of his sister Julie (Melanie Lynskey) he adds that he doesn't ""really know her all that well.""

Of course, much more happens to Ryan, Alex, Natalie, Julie and others in this picture but I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that this romantic comedy gains strength and meaning from its simultaneous, realistic look at the serious unemployment at this time as well as relationships that aren't always what they appear to be; I really like that because it gives the film a type of universal appeal which drew me in more than a traditional romantic comedy would have.

I hope that when this comes out on DVD they have good extra features! In addition, look for some great acting by Amy Morton as Ryan's other sister Kara; Danny McBride as Jim Miller, Julie's fianc; Jason Bateman as Craig Gregory and J.K. Simmons as Bob--and more! I should also mention that director/co-writer Jason Reitman did a splendid job.

Up In the Air offers a romantic comedy with meaning, depth and excellent character development. This is far better than your average romantic comedy and I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this movie. Of course, if you're interested in the road warrior experience or even a look at how the economy is costing so many people their jobs these days and possibly changing their lives forever, this is a film you should see.",1261699200,3,3519,4.762295081967213
3996083,5,B002VECMB8,"Jason Reitman has struck gold with ""Up in the Air"" a brilliant seriocomedy starring George Clooney as Ryan Bingham, a man who is always on the move.  Ryan's mission is to fly around the country, terminating people firmly but professionally.  He tries to avoid unpleasant scenes and messy lawsuits, and Bingham is very good at what he does.  He is handsome, suave, cool, and always in control.  Ryan is a professional traveler who hates coming home to his bare and unprepossessing apartment.  He packs very little baggage--necessities only--and is inordinately proud of the number of miles he has logged.  He is firm in his determination to avoid romantic commitments, and is delighted to meet his match in Alex Goran, played by the sexy and intelligent Vera Farmiga.  Alex is also a well-paid workaholic and a frequent flyer, who claims to be perfectly content with the no-strings relationship that she and Ryan enjoy.

""Up in the Air"" resonates greatly during this era of high unemployment.  Many companies do hire go-betweens to help them downsize their labor force.  Reitman's dead-on screenplay, co-written with Sheldon Turner, captures the misery of the newly out-of-work.  Many of the terminated men and women in the film are not actors, but ordinary people who have actually been fired and explain, with tears, rage, disbelief, and despair, exactly how it feels to be told that your services are no longer needed.  The scenes between Ryan and the men and women whom he lets go are genuinely heartbreaking.

Adding to the movie's richness is a subplot featuring Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener, a recent hire in Ryan's firm whose bold new ideas undercut everything Ryan has worked so hard to achieve.  The nave Keener and somewhat jaded Ryan have some lively scenes in which they disagree vociferously, each one reluctant to give an inch.  Another slightly less successful sequence deals a bit sentimentally with the wedding of Ryan's sister, Julie, whom he barely knows.

Reitman, the director, evokes magnificent performances from both his lead and supporting actors.  Clooney plays Bingham with an edge of cynicism tempered with a touch of humanity and developing self-knowledge.  Farmiga is perfect as Alex, a modern woman who can and does have it all and refuses to compromise.  Keener is appealing as the twenty-three year old Natalie, who finds out the hard way that she has a great deal to learn about life.  The veteran character actors J. K. Simmons and Sam Elliott are, as always, impressive in small roles. Special kudos go to the wonderful editor, Dana E. Glauberman, for the film's magnificent pacing.

""Up in the Air"" has many deliciously ironic moments and some intriguing surprises.  It will engage those who are disheartened by the impersonal world in which we live, a world that is increasingly ruled by Blackberry-toting, texting, twittering, and cell-phoning electronic junkies who have lost touch with reality.  This is a poignant and timely movie, one of the best of 2009.",1261612800,,3001,5.054878048780488
3996084,5,B002VECMB8,"George Clooney is NOT a great actor.  Seriously, can you picture him pulling of  Shakespeare or something like the character Daniel Plainview in THERE WILL BE BLOOD?  That's not in him...and based on the roles he selects, is not of interest to him either.  However, George Clooney IS a movie star...and I mean that in the best way.  Like Cary Grant before him, he simply oozes charm, easy, charisma and a self-deprecating sense of humor.  But what makes him so particularly invaluable is that much of the time, his ""star power"" makes his on-screen interactions with everyone contain loads of chemistry.  Think about how he and Jennifer Lopez sizzled in OUT OF SIGHT (has she every had similar charisma with any of her co-stars since?).  Or how he was able to make Tilda Swinton seems vaguely passionate in BURN AFTER READING (or how their very different chemistry elevated her to Oscar status in  MICHAEL CLAYTON).  He commands the screen, yet has enough generosity in his performance to elevate others.  An ""actor"" like Daniel Day Lewis or Meryl Streep elevates others because they know they need to bring their A-games just to keep up.  Clooney makes actors seem more normal and down-to-earth, and by the same token, charming and vivacious.

It's this quality that makes UP IN THE AIR so successful.  Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a gun-for-hire whose job is to fly around the country to different companies and fire people.  People he doesn't know and will never see again.  He does it for bosses who are to afraid to do it themselves.  He does it with an offhand charm that shields him totally from the deep emotions of the folks he's letting go.  He disarms and defuses their anger.  He's a master at what he does, and his world-traveling ways apparently perfectly suit his desire to have few real connections with people.  He is a nice guy who is nonetheless totally self-centered...which is what makes him perfect at his work.  He lacks real empathy for others, but to him, it's not  weakness but a desirable trait he actively cultivates.  He's trying to become only the 7th traveler to rack up 10 million miles.  He has all the ""executive"" level loyalty programs from hotels, car rental agencies, etc.  He never has to stand in line to check in for anything.  His home base is in Omaha, but he's only there 42 days out of the year (and his apartment is the dreariest living space he has...it is very utilitarian).

One day, his comfortable world is rocked a bit, because his firm has hired a go-getter grad student (Anna Kendrick), who has this great idea about firing people via teleconference.  It's more efficient.  Clooney, of course, is appalled...not just because such an endeavor is incredibly impersonal, but because it threatens HIS way of life.  He takes Kendrick on the road with him to show  her the ins-and-outs of firing...hoping, of course, to make her see the error of her ways.  She's a young, very tightly wound young lady...super smart and witty, but also insecure.

Their travels are punctuated by occasional Clooney's occasional liaisons with a fellow world traveler (Vera Farmiga), an age appropriate ""hook up"" for Clooney that becomes more and more serious.

The movie is exploring two themes.  It has the tone of a satirical romantic comedy (will Clooney shed his cocooned ways  to embrace a relationship with this woman who is so clearly well-matched for him?).  It also explores the current condition of our economy.  We see lots of people being fired, including REAL people who've been let go.  They are integrated into scenes with Clooney, expressing their recollections of their reactions to their own layoffs.  It's an effective device in some ways, but it also makes the ""acted"" sequences, with folks like the marvelous JK Simmons and Zach Galifinakis seem a bit hollow.  Their scenes are scripted and played somewhat for laughs...and seem petty in comparison to the real pain we see.  Ultimately, for me, this commentary, critique or  satire of the current economy (not sure exactly WHICH director Jason Reitman was aiming for) falls short.  There are moments of genuine anguish, which I appreciate...but the statement seems to be:  times are tough and it is scary to be fired.  Not exactly sure if this is revelatory!

On the other hand, I enjoyed every moment of the ""journey"" Clooney, Farmiga & Kendricks take.  While there are many moments that on the surface sound as though they'd be very conventional, predictable rom-com clichs...nothing in the film feels forced or wrong.  The three actors have chemistry and charm to burn and they all sizzle on screen.  We just really like spending time in their company.  Farmiga gives her best performance, because she has never seemed to be more easy-going or sexy.  Her character grows from convincingly charmed by Clooney (their first meeting could have been a coy, overly-clever patch of unbelievable dialogue, but is instead executed with convincing panache...they instantly achieve the chemistry that Clive Owen and Julia Roberts only dreamed of in DUPLICITY) to a mature fondness and affection.  Clooney's charm has made it easy for Farmiga to just relax and be ""herself.""  The interactions between Clooney and Kendricks are hilarious and charming as well.  She is able to disarm him in small ways, and he is able to crack her exterior some.  While Clooney dislikes her idea intensely, he never really takes it out on her personally.  Kendricks, even when her character is at her most uptight, is grounded and down to earth and doesn't try to  hard.  The two actors, one a veteran and the other quite new to the screen, interact like they've worked together for  years, and again, I must attribute much of that to Clooney.  He is a master of disarming and charming.

UP IN THE AIR has received lots of Oscar buzz, and I predict many nominations.  The acting is stellar and the script, even with the aforementioned problems, is intelligent, witty and unpredictable even when events are predictable.  I'm a little less effusive about director Reitman...however, I give  him credit for making films with super smart and charming actors and letting them tear into scripts that give adult audiences something to revel in (THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is a brilliant satire and JUNO was simply a high-energy showcase for some truly fine actors).  However, while Reitman excels in writing and in spot-on casting...his visual sense is a bit lacking.  Each location in UP IN THE AIR, whether Omaha, Wisconsin, Las Vegas or Florida feels exactly the same.  The entire movie feels like its taking place in winter...but a winter that has the same lighting in South Florida as in North Wisconsin.  It becomes a bit oppressive, and if it's meant to show that Clooney's life is just one long string of generic, dreary locales...there was no reason for that.  It is competently edited, but nothing special.  Minor quibbles.

So in the end, while I'm not as in love with UP IN THE AIR as, say, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly who named it best of the year...it is a highly entertaining, well-written movie that almost perfectly spotlights all the strengths of George Clooney, the movie star.  Absolutely a movie worth seeing.",1261526400,2,7200,4.900662251655629

8381999,4,B002VECMB8,"Was he living the good life? Flying constantly from city to city staying in hotel room after hotel room and spending his days telling people that they no longer have a job, or an income....or a purpose...all the while he was smiling through it. I know that he was supposed to be the really cool guy but to me that life would just seem empty and worthless.  He was affable, friendly and a smoozer and he repeated the same practiced speeches over and over and over. How many of us remember all the characters who made a living trying to get every employee and management person fired up?....and the most important thing to him is to qualify for a high mileage card.....How depressing. Lets not pretend that the people being fired were impressed and thought that he was a good guy....the whole thing was depressing. Then, he was dumped by a person who was even more unfeeling than he was...",1523577600,,887,4.54375

I thought I had this movie figured out early on.  I thought that Clooney's character was going to have to fire the woman he met at the airport after developing a sexual relationship with her and even falling in love with her.  Well, the movie went in a different direction and the ending left everything unresolved.  On the one hand, that's life.  On the other hand, there was no closure for the characters or the viewers.",1523145600,,560,4.4411764705882355
