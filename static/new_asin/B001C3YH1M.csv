3504688,5,B001C3YH1M,"Having read J. Meade Faulkner's book of the same name originally published for children during the late 1890s.  It is right up there with ""Treasure Island"" and ""Kidnapped.""  The 1955 film is known for Stewart Granger at the height of his acting career.  And anyone familiar with the TV show ""Bewitched"" will recognise Joan Greenwood, albeit much younger, but her voice is distinctive and well-remembered in her role as Darren's mother-in-law.  Her voice has an almost devilish tone to it.

This movie is a good family film and has action, swashbuckling, and mystery, all made in an era of movie making before blood & gore, or cussing became all the rage in Hollywood productions.  This definitely is a movie for old film buffs.  The acting is superb and costumes reasonably accurate and convincing.",1365984000,5,798,4.954887218045113

3504690,4,B001C3YH1M,I am a fan of Stewart Granger and Jon Whitely so it is easy for me to enjoy this film.  Also I am a fan of the classic film era when films had great stories and were well acted - not relying on special effects as they do today.  Stewart Granger suited the sword fighting type films and really did not get appreciated enough for some of the fine roles he played.  This film was about smuggling and the relationship between an orphaned relative of the main character.  He wanted to get rid of the child but of course he could not help developing a fatherly feeling for him.  George Sanders was another fine actor in this film.,1358640000,,624,4.254237288135593

3504693,4,B001C3YH1M,"Set in the mid 18th century on the coast of Dorset in Great Britain, a young boy (Jon Whiteley) arrives in search of a protector (Stewart Granger) that his deceased mother has entrusted him to. While quite the elegant gentleman on the surface, it's just a cover for the protector's smuggling activities and he has ambivalent feelings about the boy's arrival. Based on a novel by J. Meade Falkner, the film has the feel of a Robert Louis Stevenson boys' adventure like KIDNAPPED or TREASURE ISLAND. It's an old fashioned but modestly enjoyable effort from the great Fritz Lang, who hated shooting it in the CinemaScope process (it's his only true wide screen film) which necessitated his famous remark regarding the format that ""it wasn't meant for human beings. Just snakes and funerals"". Nonetheless, cinematographer Robert Planck's wide screen lensing is quite effective despite obviously being shot on soundstages rather than authentic English coast locations. The film suffers from a deadly performance by young master Whiteley who can't even seem to smile naturally. There's a marvelously atmospheric score by Miklos Rozsa. With George Sanders, Viveca Lindfors, Joan Greenwood, Liliane Montevecchi, Melville Cooper, Sean McClory, Alan Napier, John Hoyt, Jack Elam, Frank Feguson, Donna Corcoran, Ian Wolfe and Peggy Maley.

The Warners DVD via the Netherlands is a gorgeous and colorful anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer with English and French soundtracks and optional subtitles.",1325721600,3,1490,5.394849785407725
3504694,1,B001C3YH1M,"Warner Archive took a fairly entertaining colorful film and produced a defective DVD-R edition by using a 1:1.33 aspect ratio Television copy of the film to transfer onto the Widescreen 1:1.77 format. Guess what it looks like? People are fatter, trees are wider, buildings are lower and longer, etc. The viewer gets their first warning of this problem during the opening titles when you can see that the sides are cut off and the complete credits are not readable. I suppose if you really like this film you can ignore these problems, but if you are looking for a quality produced disc, find another title.",1301184000,13,606,4.780952380952381
3504695,5,B001C3YH1M,"If you're thinking of buying this disc, chances are you know that 1955's MOONFLEET was German-American director Fritz Lang's only film shot in the widescreen Cinemascope process - and you may have seen the quote I referenced in my title.  Despite his apparent hatred of the format, I'm pleased to say - and I hope that most will agree - that MOONFLEET makes fine use of Cinemascope, and is one of the director's best late films to boot.  It's general neglect in America is something of a mystery; it's always been well-regarded in France, it has a couple of relatively significant if not enormous stars in Stewart Granger and George Sanders, and it's one of the best films made at the height of the short-lived pirate movie fad in the mid-50s, though none of it actually takes place at sea.  But now we finally have a proper widescreen DVD of it, and you don't have to take my word for it.

The storyline is fairly simply told:  in the 1760s young John Mohune (Jon Whiteley) is sent by his mother just before her death to be cared for by a gentleman named Jeremy Fox (Granger) in the coastal town of Moonfleet.  Fox wants nothing to do with the boy - who is a continual reminder of his own mixed history with the Mohune family - though he's willing to defend him against insults to the cynical Lord and Lady Ashwood (Sanders and Joan Greenwood) and others in his broken-down old castle, and in the process the boy quickly develops a hero-worship of Fox and wants to stay with him despite the man's protestations.  For Fox, you see, is actually a smuggler, who needs to keep his secret from his rich friends even more than he needs to keep it from the boy.  His operation is conducted in caves under the old church graveyard, and when the boy overhears some of what's going on, he's in it too deep - and soon compounds the difficulties in his relationship with his unwilling guardian when he finds something that Fox must have at any cost.

MOONFLEET is based on an 1898 novel by J. Meade Faulkner; I haven't read the book but it is apparently very different.  Screenwriters Jan Lustig and Margaret Fitts have, in any case, crafted a story here that is very much in keeping with director Lang's typical moral outlook, and his resigned and gloomy attitude towards man's fate.  Granger's Fox seems a doomed man from the start, with the deck stacked very much against him the moment he takes an interest in his young charge - though it's clear that he stands apart from both the generally vicious smugglers who he employs, and the no less amoral wealthy lords and ladies with whom he consorts in the daytime.  He's playing all sides, and the introduction of a new element (young Mohune) into the mix may damn him as well as save him.  If you've seen many films from this director, you can probably guess the likely direction things will go in.

Despite the director's disdain for the widescreen, he does use it rather effectively as I mentioned in the first paragraph, and nowhere better than in a spectacular if brief duel in the Moonfleet village inn between Fox with his rapier, and one of his men turning against him with a pole-arm.  There are also a couple of excellent coastal scenes, representing the freedom that Fox thinks he'll enjoy when he finally decides he must leave England; they're the only sequences shot on location, all the rest of the film being done on sets.  So it's a quite artificial and claustrophobic world that the denizens of MOONFLEET inhabit, and this helps to emphasize the closing in of Fox's world even as he dreams of a future possible life outside of the village, outside of the Mohunes which he has been connected with, always.  The color, too, is rather extravagant and unreal, though the Eastmancolor process used isn't quite as vibrant as Technicolor.  And I would be remiss not to mention that the excellent, moody score is by Miklos Rozsa, one of the greatest of all film composers, working at a high level here if not perhaps at the very top for him.

Some viewers of the film have been very critical of the young Jon Whiteley's performance, arguing that he has the same one-note emotional range throughout the film.  It's true that he doesn't change much, but I would argue that this is appropriate, as he is quite young, in novel circumstances - and caught up in a serious hero-worship of a man who he can't really understand.  It's all the more touching I think that Jon Mohune remains so steadfast and wondering towards Fox, when Fox at various times in the film is entirely ready to abandon him, and it makes the emotional ending of the film all the more powerful.

As usual with these Warner Archive discs, there's nothing in the way of extras here; the print is fine though, and it's well worth picking up for serious Lang fans who don't already have the French R2 disc - which does have a couple of short critical commentaries, and is on the whole about the same quality as this release.  In any case, this is one of Lang's best and most sorely neglected films, and it's a joy to welcome it to an official American release.  Let's hope WESTERN UNION and BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT will follow before long.",1291075200,22,5152,4.56290672451193

8285849,3,B001C3YH1M,"For fans of English adventure stories, Moonfleet is an entertaining if lukewarm film, the tale of a young boy returning to his ancestral village to try and discover his birthright but finding a den of scoundrels instead.  I have never read the original book, but the story is reminiscent of Robert Louis Stevenson's work and I'd imagine could be an enjoyable read.

Part of the issue with the film is that although Fritz Lang brings a great amount of dark atmosphere to the stormy coasts of England, he has little feel for the British and the film feels very stagey, its performances lackluster.  Stewart Granger looks every bit the pompous Brit, but he kind of just prances around the screen like a prig and all of the secondary characters are wafer thin.  Young Jon Whiteley is very cute as the orphaned boy, but Lang certainly didn't have the Spielberg touch when working with young actors and this sort of material.  And for those looking for grand seafaring adventure, you'll be barking up the wrong cliff (there is none), while those looking for a great coming-of-age story will be similarly disappointed.  I'm pretty certain it's for these reasons that the film has been largely forgotten, unrestored, and presented here with a vintage early-90s home video transfer.

Even with fine visuals, Lang is tonally all over the map.  Does he want to turn Moonfleet into a haunted village?  A menacing one?  It's really pretty unclear and largely unsuccessful.  Still, for fans of the genre there's still something here to enjoy -- so if you don't mind its juvenile dialogue and weak characters, you'll probably have a good time.",1480204800,,1628,4.86231884057971

8285854,5,B001C3YH1M,"This is the first time I have gotten to see this movie from beginning to end, I've always just caught bits & pieces. I really enjoyed this movie but I am a big Stewart Granger fan. While not his best swashbuckling work certainly a nice addition if you are collecting Stewart Granger movies. I will say that it is much more cerebral than the average swashbuckler or pirate movie as it doesn't focus on the pirates high seas adventure of violently stripping treasure away from its defenders but gives you a look at the laundering of stolen goods & other smuggling practices! This is a nice picture on many different levels. But few people realize that pirates couldn't just walk into a bar & hand the owner a gold necklace that used to be owned by some Spanish noble woman, even back in those days such item's would have been reported & recorded as stolen & would draw negative attention in the hands of some stumbling drunken wharf rat. It is well recorded in history that the pirates were the first to have a system of workman's compensation & earned shares of the booty! It wouldn't have been practical to divide the spoils on deck, as often those spoils were bolts of cloth, barrels of whiskey & you don't destroy beautiful jewelry trying to distribute it into shares so this movie is a nice example of how Pirates would liquidate their booty into dividable cash through nefarious nobility that would ""fence"" or ""Launder"" the booty for the pirates! Stewart Granger plays just such a character in this emotionally complex adventure period piece, it also sells the morality that its never to late to change  & do the right thing. All the actors involved do a great job & this movie makes a great addition to any swashbuckler's collection if only for its unique perspective.",1418601600,5,1773,4.646496815286624
8285855,4,B001C3YH1M,"Fritz Lang's Moonfleet is a gothic melodrama, (akin to Jamaica Inn), with the king of MGM swashbucklers Stewart Granger, who befriends an orphan boy unaware that he leads a gang of smugglers. The young lad is played by Jon Whitley who was so good in The Kidnappers and with Dirk Bogarde in The Spanish Gardner and Hunted.
There is a wealth of talent in the supporting cast including the lady with the 'whiskey soaked' voice, Joan Greenwood, how we miss her mesmerising screen presence.
Lang made a great impact with films in his native Germany, but never quite achieved the quality of his early work in Hollywood, although many of his later works, now quite rightly, have gained a cult status following.
