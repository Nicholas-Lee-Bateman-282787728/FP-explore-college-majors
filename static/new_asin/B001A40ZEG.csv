8275925,5,B001A40ZEG,"This is a very good video for anyone that works out regularly, but is not some hard-core gym rat. Mike Mentzer does a great job with Markus Reinhardt as the trainee, of showing all the basic exercises, and how to do them so that all the focus is on your muscle growth. I had bought a Mike Mentzer book many years ago, and seeing this video really illustrated what he was always talking about, the focus on slow movement during the exercise. Mentzer also gives good info about the positions on the weight training machines, super-sets, and other valuable training information.

I enjoyed this video, but I was a fan of Mentzer for many years, and had read his magazine columns and some of his books. I mention that, because the back cover of the video makes the somewhat tasteless boast that the video features footage of Mike Mentzer taken just a few hours before his death. The video was supposed to have 4 parts, but it only has 3 and then the last day of the shoot, which is included as ""Behind the Scenes"" when Mentzer was chain-smoking and looked sick. Apparently they never got to finish the 4th part of the video, so they used the ""behind the scenes"" segment instead.

His brother Ray Mentzer was there also, talking about his dialysis, and his plans to open a training center at the end of the month. Kind of sad to watch them both talking about their plans for the future, just hours before Mike died. Ray Mentzer died two days after his brother. This section of the video was only useful if you were a fan of Mike and Ray Mentzer, bodybuilders of the 1970s. If you had never heard of Mentzer before buying this video, seeing him looking a bit sickly might be a turn-off (as one of the reviewers here complained about his nasally voice).

The information and video of Markus Reinhardt is very good, and the techniques and ideas will work for you. Strictly for workout information, I would give this video a B, since it was missing one segment (due to the death of Mike Mentzer). However, if you are a fan of bodybuilding, it is a great video to watch, and the lessons are worth the small price of this video.",1335398400,5,2117,4.451030927835052

a must for Mike Mentzer fans or anyone interested in high intensity training in action.
plus info not in any of Mikes books.",1302220800,3,189,4.588235294117647

8275928,1,B001A40ZEG,"I read the other reviews from this DVD to make sure I was getting a great product.  I was looking for some videoes for my husband for Christmas.  So I thought, based on the reviews, that it would make a great gift!  Well, it's not so great of a video.  Mike's voice is very nasally, and my husband just couldn't get past how annoying that was.  He just couldn't focus on working out with this in the background.  I'm sure Mike had done some great things in his time, but it just wasn't for us.",1294099200,3,493,4.136842105263158
8275929,5,B001A40ZEG,Got this video because I wanted to make sure I understood this exactly. Sometimes a visual is much better then reading it. Also as a personal trainer I want to make sure I'm doing things correctly for my clients. Great video and gives a new twist to training even if it's olds chool.,1252713600,2,283,4.3584905660377355
8275930,5,B001A40ZEG,"Considering the routines used by some of the worlds great BB's, the remarkably short but highly intense routine detailed here presents a whole new world of thought on the subject. Very interesting. Have never seen anything like it. The time saved alone through such a short routine makes it worthwhile.",1247529600,4,302,5.06
