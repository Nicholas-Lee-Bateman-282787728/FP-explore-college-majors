7815348,3,6301801385,not a bad version.  not a good version.  I have many so I know.,1510963200,,63,3.4285714285714284
7815349,1,6301801385,"Wonderful version. I just wish that I could afford the dvd, but it the BBC versions of this and ""A Little Princess"" are way out of reach, to the point that it is ludicrous. I don't want anything that much.

Mostly, I wish that ""The Secret Garden"" were either closed captioned or subtitles. It is difficult for the hard of hearing to enjoy these.

I implore Amazon to require that the sellers state whether or not a movie has either of these features. It is next to impossible to determine t his from the information provided. I would buy more movies, if I could have either of these feautures.",1424217600,,593,4.431192660550459
7815350,4,6301801385,"I own every English version of this movie, plus a Japanese version.  I like it that much.  I'd had this version, which is supposed to be an eight-part TV mini-series, made in Scotland.  I like it best, perhaps because of the greater detail, relevant to the book.  However, I loaned out my DVD version and never got it back.  I ordered this because the Product Details said it's 210 minutes.  THIS WAS WRONG.  The version I got the second time is only 107 minutes.  I want the full version, but don't know how to get it other than ordering and sending them back when they're wrong.",1404086400,,580,4.40566037735849

7815352,5,6301801385,"I believe ""Secret Garden"" is a movie both children and adults can easily lose themselves and enjoy.  Each moment The Secret Garden has the potential to take you to another place and time, while guiding your spirit and imagination from dark places, and then shedding light and answers into life's truest beauty.",1228089600,2,310,4.961538461538462

7815354,5,6301801385,"Although this is obviously a low-budget film, I like it the best of all the versions because it follows the story the closest, actually taking most of its dialogue from the book.  The acting is great, but as another viewer said, I also can't understand why some parts seem to be taped.  Also, most  unfortunately, the garden seems to me to be a set, but I could be wrong.  For those who prefer the magnificent garden and setting which I'm sure  Frances Hodgson Burnett intended, it would be best to see the Kate Maberly  version (in my opinion, that was a close second with this one).  I've seen  every version made, and all have been good, except for a pretty bad one  made in 1987.",947376000,12,683,4.4
