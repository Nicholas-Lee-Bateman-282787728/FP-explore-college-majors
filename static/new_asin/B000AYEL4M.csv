2397234,5,B000AYEL4M,"Living in Germany,I had to order this wonderful portrait in the US. And I`m glad I did so! This DVD gives a great view into the lives of our Golden Girls,how they became theses lovely ladys we adore so much. Thanks to Lifetime for sharing this with all of us!",1140566400,6,259,4.2
2397235,5,B000AYEL4M,"If you are a Golden Girls fan then this is a must have for  your collection. It gives an interesting look at each Golden Girl's background.

Ther only negative thing I find wrong with it is that for some unknown reason they decided to edited it for home viewing. Why they did that is beyond me and I really wish they wouldn't have done that. They could have made this a two disc set if space was the issue. Having said that it isn't chopped up and you don't know what is missing so maybe it is an okay thing.

You can either play the entire thing or just view which Golden Girl you want to know more about.  It is 170 minutes long.

Again this is a definite must have for every Golden Girl Fan so what are you waiting for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1138579200,7,737,4.161971830985915
2397236,5,B000AYEL4M,"As a long time fan, the behind the scenes stories with these great women really makes you admire and love them more than you already do from the series.",1138492800,,152,4.275862068965517
2397237,5,B000AYEL4M,I loved this DVD. There was so much about these girls I didn't know. I would definatly recommend this.,1137196800,,102,4.421052631578948
2397238,4,B000AYEL4M,"The interviews were very informative and gave a background of each actress.  The cover can be confusing as it is not necessarily about the show Golden Girls, and why they have Estelle Getty in Sophia make-up is their way to sell more DVD's I assume.  Each interview only includes a only small amount of information about their time on Golden Girls.",1137024000,11,348,4.688524590163935
2397239,5,B000AYEL4M,"When I first learned this dvd would be available on Amazon I was delighted because Beatrice Arthur is my favorite Golden Girl, and I had missed seeing her intimate portrait when it aired on Lifetime. Needless to say I was absolutely thrilled to pop in the dvd and learn more about my favorite funny lady!!!

The main thing I most enjoy about the intimate portrait series are the interviews are in the star's own words, so you really get to know them more intimately! Bea, Rue, Betty, and Estelle we love you!!!!",1133481600,41,511,4.554347826086956
2397240,5,B000AYEL4M,"Did you know anything about the actresses of the Golden Girls? If not, then you will soon know after buying this above average biography of each Golden Girl. Here are some shockers, Bea Arthur used to be a man, just kidding. However, Bea Arthur did use her manly voice to her advantage when she starred in Broadway. Bea Arthur, of course, became an international star when she starred in Maude. Sadly, the end of her marriage also ended, when success became too big for her husband. Rue McClanahan has been married 6 times. She is also a survivor of breast cancer. Betty White found the love of her life in her late forties but tragically he died and left her a widow. Lastly, Estelle Getty is a big aids activist and has a big gay following. Estelle also is separated from her husband. Sadly, Estelle Getty is also a victim of Parkenson disease. This may very well be her last interview.  Special Guest Appearances including the late John Ritter, Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Asner, Rosie O'Donnell and other surprises. This is a must for your Golden Girl collection. Buy it today as a compliment to any Golden Girl dvd series.",1132617600,24,1120,4.6
2397241,5,B000AYEL4M,"Of all the Golden Girls profiles aired, these are by far the most thorough and accurate tellings of each of the actresses' stories.  And included here is perhaps one of the last (if not the last) interviews of Estelle Getty.",1128297600,45,224,4.6
2397242,5,B000AYEL4M,When This Was On Lifetime They Had Outtakes Of The Golden Girls And Bloopers...Maybe It Will Have It On Here Also..But Whatever The Case I Will Be Getting This! No Golden Girl Fan Should Be Without It!,1125446400,15,201,4.45945945945946

2397251,5,B000AYEL4M,"A collection of the Intimate Portrait series shown on Lifetime regarding each ""Golden Girl"".  Shows a lot about each of them which you may be unaware of and offers one a greater appreciation for what each has done in their lives.",1220313600,,229,4.585365853658536
2397252,5,B000AYEL4M,"I purchased this DVD because, of course, I am a huge fan of The Golden Girls.  I enjoyed this DVD very much.  I had seen the Intimate Portrait of Rue (Blanche) on Lifetime before, but have never seen the other girls or even knew that they had an Initmate Portrait.

2397255,4,B000AYEL4M,"Everything I wanted to know about each Golden Girl is in this interesting DVD. For instance, I din't know anything about Estelle Getty's long career in the theater before her role as Sophia. And I din't know Rue had been married so many times ;o) And what about Bea Arthur, my favorite Golden Girl. She is such a talented actress and I din't know she had been a lab technician before becoming the great actress we all love. And I also din't know Betty White had been married twice before marrying the love of her life: Allen Ludden. All in all, the four of them were absolutely great in ""The Golden Girls"" and I intend to buy all the DVD's.",1194825600,7,640,4.341666666666667

From the first episode to the last, I lived, loved, and laughed with these Golden ladies.",1188604800,2,338,4.491803278688525

2397261,5,B000AYEL4M,"I have been a die-hard fan of the Golden Girls since I was 7 years old.  I could quote every line of every episode, but I knew very little about the actresses behind my favorite T.V. characters. When I received this, I watched it right away and found it very interesting.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, is only a casual fan of the show, and he was bored silly!!! If you are a big fan of the show and just want to know more about the lives of these women, order now.

2397262,4,B000AYEL4M,This was mostly the stars talking about their life history and showing photographs.  It would have been better if they would have shown scenes from the golden girls or the stars performances from other shows.,1168905600,3,208,4.942857142857143
2397263,5,B000AYEL4M,"This DVD proved to be quite a treat for fans of The Golden Girls when it was released. It features 4 wonderful specials on each of the Golden Girls: Bea Arthur, Estelle Getty, Betty White, and Rue McClanahan. Each episode lasts about 40 to 50 minutes long and is entertaining, yet very informative. What fan doesn't want to learn more about their favorite Golden Girl? I'm so glad this DVD was released. It's a treat for all the GG fans out there.",1154995200,19,447,4.463414634146342

8080569,5,B000AYEL4M,"Really, really good. We watched all the original shows, and saw these women at their finest. This documentary of each ""golden"" separately, was respectful while being honest, and the women themselves took us  through the great, the lousy, and the hallmarks  of their fame, from stage to television. I bought if for my Betty White Type mother, who is now 89.y.o, in a nursing home, and doing fantastic--especially with all the show's reruns available to her, and all the rest of us baby boomers in their retirement years now.",1459036800,,523,4.865168539325842
8080570,4,B000AYEL4M,"What a fun DVD!  We love the guilty pleasure of the Golden Girls.  This put the life stories of the those four behind their acting.  I was going to watch one segment a day, but ending up wasting the whole afternoon.  I couldn't turn it off.  Amazing how accepted the Hollywood lifestyle is...in Hollywood.  Made me very thankful, one more time,  for my fantastic wife of 35 years.  But, as I said, if you enjoy the Golden Girls, you'll love this DVD!  Dave (in Colorado)",1453852800,,470,4.435294117647059
