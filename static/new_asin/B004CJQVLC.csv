8423062,5,B004CJQVLC,"high quality dvd. I so enjoyed that the picture and sound were clear, crisp.",1470096000,,76,4.5
8423063,2,B004CJQVLC,"Second disc doesn't play the rest of the episodes. It stops during the second Dragnet and won't play the Burke's Law or Checkmate episodes. Disc 1 plays great. It would have been a fun set otherwise, as it's nice to have a variety of episodes to sample.
Film quality is mediocre, like what you see for public domain movies/tv.",1459900800,,326,4.5423728813559325
8423064,1,B004CJQVLC,"I know it was inexpensive but seriously!  The second episode of Dragnet would not play after a few minutes. Nothing, The disk is not damaged etc. Just would not play. When I tried the one episode of Checkmate it played a Richard Diamond episode!  The quality varies.  Dragnet is horrid, but Richard Diamond is ok all thing considered.  I don't expect much but I do expect all the shows to be there as advertised.  This was disc 2. Haven't tried disc one as yet.",1428192000,2,461,4.440476190476191

8423066,5,B004CJQVLC,"The shows on this Dvd set is a show the whole family can watch together. It keeps you on the edge of your seat.
and you do not have to worry about words or scene, not fit for children.",1393372800,4,184,3.7435897435897436
