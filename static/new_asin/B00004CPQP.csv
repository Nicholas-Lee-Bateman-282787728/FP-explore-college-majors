There's something wrong with this picture when a kid has to stand up for what's right, because not a single grown adult will. The boy Charlie probably wouldn't have changed though, had Walter ""Gossett"" not gone out of his way to be nice to him, unlike his drunk worthless father. All the actors are very believable with their rolls and Joseph Mazzello gives a heartwrenching performance as usual. Actually I watched this film after seeing ""The Cure,"" ""another movie starring Mazzello about prejudisim,"" because he's such an excellent and emotional actor. I hadn't really payed attention to the credits before watching ""High Lonesome"" and the whole entire time I thought the father was Patrick Swayze. Him and his brother Don must be identical twins, they look so much alike!",1251504000,2,855,4.944444444444445
1339754,5,B00004CPQP,"This is absolutely one of my favorite movies, ever.  I was lucky enough to capture it on VHS way back when it first aired 10+ years ago.  I have watched my old VHS version over and over again, and have shared it so many times with extended family, that I finally decided it was time to upgrade to DVD.  What I adore so much about this story is the powerful portrayal of how love and undeserved mercy can reverse the effects of hate, and win the enemy over to higher thinking and being.  The story illustrates the greatest height of human character:  a willingness to choose to ""do good to those who persecute you.""  Add to this the old-fashioned charm of yester-year (the setting is the era of the great depression); and add the truly excellent performances of the cast, and you have a timeless, beautiful treasure on film.  If you prefer to see the good guys win, and win big, then you'll love this movie.  Due to the historically accurate racial violence in the film, I recommend parents of very young children watch it first to determine appropriateness.  Otherwise it is family programming at its very best.  Thank you Hollywood!",1235779200,9,1133,4.592039800995025
1339755,5,B00004CPQP,"Lous Gossett, Jr. did again, with the help of a talented young actor.  Together and wove an intimate, touching story that dealt with the harsh realities of life in the old, wild west; a time where the color of a person's skin determines whether he stay alive or not.",1225670400,4,266,4.428571428571429
1339780,4,B00004CPQP,"Heartwarming story that is excellently acted.  Saw this made-for-tv movie many years ago as ""A Father for Charley.""  Was amazed that I could find it now on DVD although under a different title.  Only reason for 4 stars is that it IS a tv movie.  Would liked to see what they could have done with a movie theatre length story and production values.",1385164800,2,347,4.4603174603174605
1339781,5,B00004CPQP,This is my favorite tv movie of all time!  Lou Gossett Jr. is excellent.  A great lesson about love overcoming prejudice.,1384905600,,121,4.714285714285714

1339783,5,B00004CPQP,"I used this movie in VHS format years ago when teaching 5th grade. The portrayal of the time period and racism in the South is spot on. After changing grade levels and moving to literature, I now use this as a better viewing choice after reading  ""Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"". There are parallel story lines, and the setting is the comparable. I am thankful that I remembered this as a Hallmark Movie called ""A Father for Charlie"" back in the day. It is a great teaching tool and well worth the classroom time it takes to view.",1329091200,2,529,4.343434343434343
1339784,5,B00004CPQP,I looked for this movie for a long time.  I first saw it on TV under the name A father for Charlie.  Changing the title was very confusing.  It is a great movie .  I highly recommend it as a good family movie.,1325635200,,209,3.7906976744186047
1339785,5,B00004CPQP,"High Lonesome (True Stories Collection TV Movie

High Lonesome is another movie that I got for Louis Gossett Jr, but gained 2 more favorite actors. The little boy, Joseph Mazzello , stills my heart. As an African American man, I get very angry when I watch movies about the past injustices done to African Americans by whites. It is movies like this that reminds me that I'm on the right path, because I choose not to see all whites as evil, just as I choose not to pretend that my fellow African Americans are faultless in today's society. I warn you, Joseph will tear your heart to pieces, and put it back together in the right way. You can't watch this movie and not want to be a better person. Joseph is an amazing actor. Very few adult actors/actresses can compete with his talent.",1286582400,2,786,4.458333333333333
1339786,5,B00004CPQP,"Really good movie that shows love overcomes racial differances. A young white boy befriends an older black man because his drunken father cares less about him, if at all. Highly recomend for anyone who has a heart.",1286064000,,214,4.8108108108108105

7920188,5,B00004CPQP,"High Lonesome is one of the more accessible films I've seen on the matter of Southern United States racism and the Ku Klux Klan, but it is still not for the faint hearted, as it does not hide anything. It is, however, more three dimensional in its characterisation than many other treatises of the genre, and is therefore a lot more helpful to those of us who seek to combat racism. There is a small amount of humour, which makes the pathos more palatable, and the quality of the acting will hold you throughout. Louis Gossett jr. and Joseph Mazzello deserve recognition for the quality of their work here. The DVD worked well.",1406678400,2,627,4.557522123893805
