The mixture of the actors/actresses ethnically played well with the areas the movie was shot in as well as the character development without the use of stereotypes (a relief, given the usage of stereotypes in movies and TV shows currently).  I thoroughly enjoyed the interaction between all of the characters in the film, although a few of them seemed fairly contrived and taken to extremes (must have been all of the IPA consumed during the film).  Overall the film was very entertaining, had a very realistic ending and was over with well before I wanted it to end.  If you like rock and roll and would like to get a hint of what it is really like (not the euphemistic plots hurled at us in most other movies) being an aspiring musician or you just want to entertained for while, this is the movie for you.",1368403200,5,940,4.511764705882353

8612266,5,B00F4FJ08E,This one's worth watching! The story line is up to date and the situations are real! The mix of races is noteworthy as it isn't seen much in movies and these youngsters are modern America!,1402963200,,188,4.4
8612267,5,B00F4FJ08E,"The Crumbles is a great, feel-good sort of movie about youngsters starting a rock band. It's very realistic and enjoyable, and I think anyone who has a best friend can relate to it. Also, there is fun music in it that will put a smile on your face. If you enjoy awkward humor, endearing characters, fun songs, and great acting, this is definitely the movie you want to watch!",1399075200,2,375,4.449275362318841
8612268,5,B00F4FJ08E,"The first impression I got from watching the trailer was the movie looked like a feel-good, cult-following, niche-audience, young-adult to hipster-adult, indie movie, that  seemed a bit like (though Hollywood, with some minor-to-famous cameos) the movie, Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist. The trailer gives off that the movie will have its trials and tribulations, but also a sense of humor, and that relatable feeling of trying to make a living and following ones passions/hobbies in life. The actors in the film look like normal people you would see in suburbs or on the streets, not like the plastic always dressed to the nines glamour and stylish Los Angelenos.

The songs were catchy, the drama was relatable, and the laughs had good timing.
The little picturesque shots of Echo Park made the movie have a nice home-away-from-home feeling mixed with some hip tour-guiding.",1397952000,,878,5.176056338028169
8612269,4,B00F4FJ08E,"Fun, fast moving, unpretentious and very entertaining.  Also, it made Los Angeles look like a cool city which is impressive, since it's not a cool city.",1389225600,,152,4.846153846153846
8612270,4,B00F4FJ08E,"I saw this movie at the Laemmle Playhouse 7 in Pasadena, CA... twice! I really enjoyed Quetzal Flores' kick-ass soundtrack, the relatable and ethnically diverse characters, and the locations (as my friend commented, the city of Silverlake was a character of its own). The Crumbles is difficult to categorize because it isn't overtly a comedy and it doesn't take itself seriously like a drama. It's 73 minutes spent with 3 dorky 20-somethings trying to start a rock band -- and it's perfect as just that. (On a side note, $10 is actually a great price considering most independent movies charge $15-$20 for their DVDs)

The story is straight-forward: Laid-back singer/guitarist Darla wants to start a band. Her friend, free-spirited keytarist Elisa, is back in town indefinitely and asks to crash at Darla's apartment (for an indefinite period of time). They recruit Darla's friend, soft-spoken (and six-pack-ab-packing) drummer Dante. Darla is serious about the band, but Elisa's behavior is unpredictable. We spend a little over an hour hanging out with these three bandmates, watching them find their musical groove, drinking, posing awkwardly at a photo shoot, getting into arguments, and playing their first two shows.

The Crumbles is a movie about a garage rock band so a kick-ass soundtrack is obligatory (I don't have any other adjective to describe this soundtrack because ""kick-ass"" is all encompassing of Flores' work). Crunchy guitars, danceable drums, playful synthesizers, and pop-punk vocals make up the majority of the soundscape, along with sections of instrumental reggae-esque and dreamy guitar film score. The original songs really capture the essence of a rock band in its beginning phase -- not fully developed but 100% fun, energetic, and to the point.

Being born and raised in Los Angeles, I really appreciated the filmmakers' attention to locations and the multi-racial cast. Protagonists in Hollywood are disproportionately Caucasian, so we often have to rely on independently-produced movies for diverse representations. But I don't want to scare people into thinking that they won't be able to ""relate"" to The Crumbles. The filmmakers do not place any emphasis on ethnicity (or gender) -- the main protagonists just happen to be Asian American females. What I really enjoyed was that all of the characters reminded of somebody I know/knew in real life: the awkward musicians, the free-spirited one, the obnoxious (yet lovable) roommate who constantly announces his sexual escapades. Oh, and not to mention the brooding boyfriend that nobody likes.",1383091200,2,2576,5.3399014778325125
