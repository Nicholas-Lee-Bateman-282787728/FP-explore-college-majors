5426974,5,B00AIBZKFG,"I have read reviews that this was trite and very Hollywood. Although it has a larger feel than the Paradise Lost trilogy, it is still extremely informative. I have watch all the documentaries on this case, researched all the court documents online and read Life After Death and Devil's Knot out of curiosity and fascination. This story is heartbreaking and the documentary is a wonderful end to a grueling battle. There are cheesy parts, especially the end, but it's hard to not be emotionally cheesy after such a long hard fight for justice. I recommend watching the trilogy, and researching this case prior to watching this documentary to fully understand how much hard work and time was put into getting the WM3 free. Although the battle is not won entirely, it is so satisfying to see these men finally get a large portion of freedom back. Keep supporting the WM3 until their names are cleared and the real killer is caught.",1375142400,3,928,4.770186335403727

5426976,5,B00AIBZKFG,"""West of Memphis"" (2012 release; 147 min.) brings the story of the West Memphis Three case, in which three teenagers in West Memphis, Arkansas are accused and convicted of the 1993 murder of three 8 year old boys in what appears to be a ""satanic"" killing after sexual abuse. But we know by now (and this is not ruining the 'plot') that the three teenagers would eventually be released. Several comments:

First, in the retelling of the events, the documentary reminds us that one of the three teenagers in fact confessed to being at and witnessing the murders, even though in fact he did not. This is reminiscent of that other documentary from last year (""Central Park Five""), in which a group of teeneagers confess to a crime they did not commit. Why do the innocent then confess? Just watch! Second, there are a lot of interesting tidbits in the movie that will make you revolt against the way the prosecution AND the jury AND the West Arkansas community at large essentially railroaded the three defendants at the time of the trial. They all wanted someone to be convicted, and they got three of them to be convicted. Third, it only takes about the first hour of the movie to expose the injustice and at that point I thought to myself ""what else is there to be told for another hour and a half?"". Let me simply assure you that the documentary goes into several new directions that will surprise and make you shake your head even more.

A lot of people gave their all to expose this injustice, including Peter ""Lord of the Rings"" Jackson and Eddie ""Pearl Jam"" Vedder, just to name those. I found it rather strange that so much screen time was given to Jackson in particular, but then when the credits started rolling at the end of the movie, I noticed that the movie is co-produced by Peter Jackson (and Damien, one of the three defendants). Director Amy Berg, who previously gave us another excellent documentary called ""Deliver Us From Evil"", does a great job pulling everything together, although I will admist that at 2 1/2 hrs., the movie is just a bit too long for its own good. Last but not least, the excellent soundtrack for the documentary comes courtesy of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (of the Bad Seeds), who last year also scored the excellent ""Lawless"". I happened to catch this movie recently in Sydney, Australia while I was there on a bunisness trip. It's supposed to come in theatres soon in the US. Bottom line: this movie is riveting and revolting at the same time. As a lawyer myself, it just never ceases to amaze me how certain procescutors will do whatever it takes to come to a ""politically correct"" verdict, regardless of the facts and at whatever cost. Meanwhile ""West of Memphis"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1362009600,22,2738,4.631687242798354
5426977,5,B00AIBZKFG,"This movie shows a true mistake in the American justice system. If you know anything about the case of the west Memphis 3 than you know that Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley Jr were wrongfully convicted of the murder of 3 eight year old boys. West Of Memphis shows the damning amount of evidence against Terry Hobbs a victims step father. He is the only parent of the victims that still believe's the West Memphis three are the killers. What is truly sad is that because the state of Arkansas will not admit a mistake, Terry Hobbs has gotten away with murdering 3 eight year old boys. This movie shows when the West Memphis 3 walked free after accepting an Alford Plea. If you don't know what that is it means the West Memphis 3 can maintain their innocence but must plead guilty to the murders. That means that the case is closed and the real murder Terry Hobbs gets away with it. This shows that the state does not care about justice AT ALL they only care about being right.",1357862400,59,995,4.442622950819672

5427079,5,B00AIBZKFG,"Since it was released after the boys were released this story ultimately is able to tell the whole story from it's beginnings to it's end. As such, it is able to tell the entire story in a concise way.

The story is well known but I'll repeat it for reference. In May 1993 three boys went missing. The next day their naked corpses were found in a ditch bound with their own laces. People believed they had been mutilated, and after a month a teenager named Jessie Miskelley confessed, implicating two other boys (Jason Baldwin and Damian Echols). A year later he and his two friends were convicted; Jason and Jessie got life, while the alleged ringleader Damian was sentenced to death. Normally that would have been the end of the story, but as it turns out some film makers were filming the entire trial for a documentary about killer kids. Fortunately for the world, they noticed something deeply wrong and in 1996 the documentary Paradise Lost was released. The documentary brought the case to a wider audience and exposed some of the problems (Jessie was interrogated without a lawyer or a parent present despite being mentally handicapped, his ""confessions"" were utterly inconsistent with both common sense and the facts of the case, the ""ritual murder"" motive made absolutely no sense.) It wasn't a perfect documentary (Jessie did confess more than once and Damian did have some mental problems) but fortunately these omissions were not as damaging (the confessions were still garbage and the worst problems attributed to Damian were largely embellished by his probation officer or local rumor). In short, Damian had issues but he was NOT a killer and Jessie's confessions were utter garbage.

For a while it was an indy cause, with some celebrities supporting it....but in 2007 things took a remarkable turn. Peter Jackson paid to get DNA testing done, and the DNA implicated Terry Wayne Hobbs, the stepfather of one of the victims. Further investigation revealed that Hobbs alibi was extremely weak AND that he had a history of violence against women and children (including attempting to rape his neighbor for reporting his domestic abuse). Just as importantly, the defense was able to hire 7 extremely qualified and gifted experts, who challenged the state's medical examiner and exposed his incompetence. As the cracks grew, the state continued to dig in and try to bury their mistake even as John Mark Byers and Pamela Hobbs (who once hated the three) started to support them.

Fortunately, in 2010 two things happened; firstly Judge Burnett (who had deliberately stonewalled all the previous attempts) got elected to state senate, allowing a more impartial judge to take a look. Secondly, the Arkansas Supreme Court allowed evidentiary hearings to be held for a new trial, rejecting the prosecutor's logic that defendants should be forbidden to do testing to prove their innocence. The next year the state of Arkansas, realizing that they would most likely loose a new trial, agreed to an alford plea (the boys pled guilty but were allowed to protest their innocence); despite their reluctance they agreed and are now free.

Ultimately, the documentary is a indictment of the power of fear, and the elements of society that we are ashamed to acknowledge. When I was watching it I commented that the lead investigator (Gary Gitchell) did not impress me (in fact the guy's pretty much every corrupt hillbilly stereotype known to man.) My father, who was watching it, agreed but asked ""who hired detective Gitchell?"" It's a fair point; it's easy to assume that Gitchell's a lone wolf and not a common practice of law enforcement but that's an avoidance of the truth (which is that people like Gitchell are only able to do damage because people either actively want officers like him or don't care.) It's like how with the Jon Burge scandal many officers prefer to ignore that a lot of the higher ups AGREED with Burge's habit of torturing people with electroshock (or in the case of Richard Devine looked the other way). Even the supporters of the boys fell into that trap for a while (from 1996 up until 2007, when DNA testing implicated Hobbs they suspected Byers largely due to his over the top and flamboyant behavior and unfairly harassed him. As Dennis Riordan points out this is no different than how the boys were treated by scared townspeople.) As such they were as embarrassed by the DNA results implicating Terry Hobbs as much as the non believers were

More than anything the film captures the heartbreak and loss that these families and the three wrongfully convicted felt. The story accurately captures the sadness and misery the surviving families endured, never letting the viewer forget that the boys had hopes and dreams. John Mark Byers and Pamela Hobbs, people who once hated the three men, are highly sympathetic. Byers is a man who lost his child and let his grief take him down a dark road; however he was ultimately able to admit that he was wrong when confronted with proof of their innocents (which is a mark of strength); even the Moore family (who still clings to the belief that the right men were convicted) are ultimately sympathetic. Todd Moore may be wrong in his hatred, but it comes from the grief of a man who lost his son. The three men are also tragic; Damian, for all his flaws, did not deserve to be thrown on death row, and shows that for all he's lost he's an articulate and intelligent (if somewhat arrogant) young man. Jessie Miskelley is the kind hearted but not terribly smart kid who ultimately got shanghaied by corrupt officials, and Jason is the ultimately normal boy who like Jessie fell prey to the corrupt. You will truly feel anger at both John Fogelman (the prosecutor) Gary Gitchell (the corrupt officer who manipulated Jessie) and Judge Burnett (the judge who refused to call the prosecutors out on their unethical tactics) for the heartless cruelty they showed to both the three convicted and in a way to the families

In it's current state the case is in limbo; while Michael Hobbs (brother of Terry Hobbs) may know something he won't talk unless he's dragged before a grand jury and the state (who has the power to try and get the truth) refuses to do so for fear of admitting that they made a horrible mistake. As such the case is still in limbo; unlike others though it has a happy ending (or as happy as such a tragedy can have.) Ultimately the three innocents were released and Terry Hobbs (who is in all likelihood the true killer) is not having an easy time.

All in all should be watched by anyone who thinks we have a good system",1505692800,,6607,4.795434591747147

It provides an enormous amount of detail and incredibly compelling new evidence that was uncovered by the newest defense team (and the many supporters) of the WM3, that ultimately led to their release (in a truly bizarre manner). Also, the Paradise Lost films were pretty sensationalistic, especially the 2nd one in regards to the Byers step-father and portraying him as the murderer. Don't get me wrong... the PL movies were compelling in their own way, and, of course if it weren't for those films, this film would've probably never been made and Damian Echols may not be alive today, I just feel that this one does a more thorough job of detailing all the screwups of the prosecution and the West Memphis PD, as well as shining a light on the amazing twists and turns uncovered during the final years of the case.",1495497600,,884,4.673076923076923

5427149,4,B00AIBZKFG,"This was by far the best of the WM3 documentaries. Paradise Lost was pretty decent but the second Paradise Lost made me disgusted with the film makers. They were doing to Byers what they claimed  the prosecution did to the WM3. Their agenda was blinding. This was a much more balanced film and while I do think setting innocent men free from jail for murders they didn't commit, I found myself really angry that people seemed to not care as much about the TRUE victims. Those 8 year old boys were brutalized. It's unconscionable. I felt sorry for Byers to be accused of killing his stepson just because he was ""strange."" They seemed to not care about WHY he was strange. This film does help some in exonerating him, unlike Paradise Lost 2 that disgustingly painted him as a murderer to fit their agenda. I want to see as much outrage over the fact that those 3 poor little boys were brutalized and murdered that the public showed for the falsely accused.

  First of all, I think anyone that only watches these propaganda movies and jumps to a quick, emotional conclusion whether these 3 are guilty or not, is preposterous. This movie, just like other three, manipulates and carefully overlooks several undeniable facts about this case. If you are interested like me, READ the case files, if you are willing to invest your time, a whole, entirely different picture paints if front of your eyes.  First: Echols has  a complete and well documented violent schizophrenia/psychosis history, which was presented during the trial. He was institutionalized TWICE, for a year. He is by all accounts: violent, delusional and dangerous. His own parents want him out of the house because of threat to his siblings. No word about it, in any of the movies. Second, Miskelley misses a lot of details during his interrogation because per his own words, he is drunk out of his mind during the whole event. Disturbingly enough he mentions many FACTUAL information, like the location of empty whiskey bottle, he consumed that night at the crime scene, or that the boys were hog tied. He confesses, not once or twice, he does it on numerous basis, even in front of his own lawyer. Echols, is a proven manipulator and most of all, a LAIR. For instance he claims he has never been around Robinhood Woods, where in fact, he lived in the apartments in front of the woods. There are many other, proven lies.  No physical evidence? The lake knife matches exactly Stevie's head injuries. And lastly, not a single of these guys has an worthy alibi. Please read, all the factual case information.
  Also, Im strongly disturbed by these so called step parents of these boys. Their criminal backgrounds is one thing, but to clown around and treat this whole situation as a source of profits is simply sick. Please remember about Michael, Stevie and Christopher. Their own home state has let them down. Lastly, too bad these senselessly slaughtered children haven't had a 20 million dollar scrupulous investigation, but 20 some later year later Hollywood circus shows up to turn everything upside down...",1489449600,,2377,4.868811881188119

5427275,4,B00AIBZKFG,"Other than having a passing knowledge of the West Memphis 3 situation I had unfortunately up to this point gone on without really looking into it. My mother recently borrowed a movie from a friend about it called 'Devil's Knot' and then proceeded to tell me every minute detail about the case anytime we spoke including reams of print outs. I could start to see why so many people cared and all the celebrities got on board.

 So I came across this doco 'West of Memphis' and picked it up for her and when I went around for dinner the other night we watched it. The anger you feel for the misjustice that was inflicted on these three young men is incredible. Putting aside the poor little kids that were murdered, how the hell could a police dept, lawyers and court be so incompetent. It's like they just decided from the get go these three young men must've done it and worked backwards trying to tie everything to them.

 All that 'satanic panic' stuff was below the belt and sadder that it seems a number of people perhaps due to lack of education and leading mundane lives dreamt up fantasy stories to tell authorities in helping to convict them.

 I think the doco would've been better if they didn't focus so much on Terry Hobbs. The doco would stand up on it's own just focusing on the fact the WM3 were clearly innocent and they needed to be released, unfortunately by being found guilty at the same time meaning Hobbs can never be tried.

Or you could save yourself six hours or so and just go straight to 'West of Memphis.' It covers most of the same ground but is more professionally produced and has the benefit of hindsight.

5427473,5,B00AIBZKFG,"While the story of the West Memphis Three, their awful flawed trial and subsequent efforts to obtain freedom were well covered in the Paradise Lost trilogy of films, this one film overview has a lot of value.  Perhaps because the case can now be looked back on, it feels like there is a clearer focus here than in the excellent Paradise Lost series.  There also seems to be more of a focus on the emotion and humanity of ALL the victims  the three falsely convicted young men, but also the families that lost their children.  Last, the film makes some of the awful holes in the prosecution case more simple and clear than earlier accounts, as well as putting a chilling spotlight on the possible real perpetrator, but without the theatrics that harmed Paradise Lost 2, which seemed to do some of what the trial did to the three boys; throw suspicion on a subject largely because he acted weird.

Here the investigation feels more dispassionate and scientific, and less manipulated, leaving one with questions rather than forcing conclusions.  The world might not have needed another film on the subject, but personally, I feel the more injustice can be intelligently examined and exposed the better off we are as a society.",1453161600,3,1223,4.7725118483412325

5427490,4,B00AIBZKFG,"Entertaining movie with lots of interesting tidbits. However, be advised, this is a very impartial take on the case. Don't get me wrong, the original trial was a sham, but there was a little more objectivity in Paradise Lost. This film is put together by Damian Echols' wife, who certainly does not shun attention. Many disturbing points are made about the state of Arkansas, in particular, the prosecuting attorneys and the crime lab. It does seem that evidence was buried and cooked by a state more interested in finding a scapegoat than finding the actual killer or killers. I believe there was a miscarriage of justice when the three boys were originally convicted. I am also concerned with Echols' statement that what happened to them happens every day in America. That is disturbing.",1448150400,,789,4.93984962406015

I don't believe in an afterlife, but if I'm wrong these individuals will have some atoning to do.

5427555,5,B00AIBZKFG,"Another compelling chapter in the case of the West Memphis 3. If you are not familiar with this case or the HBO Paradise Lost trilogy you really must watch this to see how local politics and corrupt public service workers can put 3 innocent teens on death row while the real killer goes free. If you are interested in this case I would recommend the Paradise Lost series first since it is currently available free with Amazon prime. However if you do not have prime and don't want to rent the previous movies, this movie does work well on its own. It summarizes most of what happens in the first the documentaries and then gives some additional information not in the first 3 films . After watching the first Paradise lost film I was compelled to watch the remaining film, then this film, and also purchases some of the books By Damien Echols, the oldest of the 3 teens sentenced to death row who had used his 18 years on death row to become a very proficient writer.  The story of how these Kids were wronged by the justice system yet never gave up to despair and managed to walk away with most of their humanity intact while seeing the murder who put them in their situation walk free from persecution is both inspiring and gut wrenching at the same time.",1438387200,,1257,4.441558441558442

5427636,4,B00AIBZKFG,"If you've watched all three of the HBO ""Paradise Lost"" documentaries concerning the ""West Memphis 3, Robin Hood Hills child murders"" this documentary will serve as both a summary and add-on. The initial case through incarceration is screened early on and moved aside quickly as we start to get into the aftershocks of what just happened.

The amazing thing about this case is the absolute lack of physical evidence tying any of the defendants to the crime. There isn't just a lack, there just isn't any ... at all. The whole case hinged on a) the coerced confession of a frightened, mentally challenged young man. b) Damion Echols personality c) False testimony by highly questionable sources. But, given this was Arkansas and the country was gripped by ""satanic"" cults, this was enough to send two to prison for life and one to the death chamber. Astounding stuff.

Some big name celebrities got behind the case early on and raised money on behalf of the defendants. Damien Echols' girlfriend was instrumental in reaching out, organizing and ultimately, saving Damien's life along with freeing Jesse and Jason.

The strength oi this documentary is in the depth of coverage given to the independent analysis of the evidence given by very respected individuals in their fields. It's astonishing when you compare the original state's case against the newer analysis that you just shake your head. In 1993 Arkansas just wanted a head to feed to the public and they found three of them in the form of Echolls, Baldwin and Misskelley.

As the new evidence is presented to the original trial judge he denies new hearings, one after the other. His reasoning will anger you and, again, you'll just shake your head.

Eventually, in the face of overwhelming evidence presented to the state's supreme court, and in-lieu of a retrial, the state let's the defendants cop an ""Alford"" plea which allows them to be sentenced to time-served. Out they go but, they had to plead guilty. Sickening.

Enjoy this documentary it's extremely well put together and the content is fascinating but, also see it as a cautionary tail.",1438214400,9,2105,4.932203389830509

It's maddening that apparently they didn't do complete investigative searches at the parents' homes.
It's criminal that the prosecution KNEW the knife in the lake was there a year before the crime yet entered it into evidence.
It should be unlawful for the prosecution to send in a drug-addled woman to bring in false information on Damien with no punitive actions against her or the police.
The judge & prosecutor should be behind bars & the entire detective division of the police force should  have been fired & replaced.
They now seem to point guilt at Terry hobbs. Just like they previously pointed to John Mark Byers & the 3 teens.

5427699,4,B00AIBZKFG,"First of all, this is a pro-WM3 documentary and most people would agree that its a biased angle. But its probably the best of all the WM3 documentaries. If you don't believe that the three men did the crime then its also the best documentary in terms of making a convincing case of who possibly committed these crimes. Ive seen four documentaries and listened to the confessions by Jessie Miskelley Jr. and read transcripts from the trial. So, I haven't seen everything or looked at everything but I do have to admit that I would not have been able to find any three of these men guilty under reasonable jury instructions. It still puzzles me how the jury got such an assured verdict based on what seemingly little they had to go on at trial. I do wish that the documentarians had made better use of questioning the juror they featured in this movie. Its refreshing to look at the case with the benefit of time passing so that you can get all the information in one spot. I have felt like Paradise Lost lost its credibility after the first documentary. Apart from all the agendas, messages and hoopla aside --- this would even be a worthy document of how the longterm effect jail has on defendants and relationships. Its also a positive look on how to take a grim situation and meld it into something more meaningful. This has to be one of the most controversial/talked-about cases in our countrys history. While it doesnt bring a whole lot new to the table on who may have done these murders and mostly only uses the wrongful accusations based on appearance/entertainment interests of the convicted three --- I think that West of Memphis is one of the best documentaries about this specific case.",1427587200,,1697,4.622516556291391

I saw the original documentary back when it first aired and have followed the case ever since.  Its hard to believe these guys went through what they had to endure for almost 2 full decades.  Also the families of the victims.  Re-living this over and over because of the publicity it received - forcing the topic again and again to the forefront.  Had the idiot of a judge just admitted his mistakes - everyone involved would have been spared untold heart ache and misery.  A corrupt and self serving prosecutor and police detective and a back woods, ignorant, holy crap this guy actually got elected to the senate judge - all combined together = one of the hardest to believe stories ever.  Its crazy to imagine that every word of this is true and that 3 guys had to go through everything they went through and 3 families had to endure everything they had to endure bc of a group of redneck idiots who couldn't admit they were wrong.  the real killer may not have been caught - although i think the world knows who it really is now (thanks to the films) - but at least they can move on with their lives and aren't forced to relive the most tragic day of their lives over and over bc of the publicity. It's happy yet also sad in every area to me.  3 guys who got what is truly a crappy deal in the end, but at least they got their freedom and can move on and start to put the pieces back together thanks to some very generous and thank God caring celeb's at least they can start to have lives.  Eddie Vedder, Johnny Depp, Henry Rollins, The Free WM3 team and all the others - u guys/gals really did something good!  Not just for the wm3 guys but for the victims families as well.  Eddie especially has always been a guy I've admired as an artist and person - but he really showed he's ""real"" by dedicating his time, talent and money to help out 3 poor underprivileged strangers and 3 innocent young boys who were robbed of every chance.  Although nothing can be done to help the 3 victims at least you didn't sit back and allow there to be 3 more innocent boys robbed of life.

5427895,5,B00AIBZKFG,This documentary knocked it out of the park for me. I remember the first in the HBO documentary Paradise Lost thinking those boys did not do that. I lost track of it. And some people were talking about it  in one of my Facebook group. So I was curious what I had missed all these years. Because I believe without a doubt those boys were indeed innocent. So I watched Paradise Lost Purgatory and Paradise Lost Revelations. And I did more research and come upon this. Did I want to pay full price for purchase..NO! But it was worth it. It tied up every loose end I had. And I said from the beginning I did not like Terry Wayne Hobbs. It was something just off about him and I was right on the money. I believe he did it. My friends and I debate all the time and sometimes we can get the other to see the others point of view in this instance I won't budge. I don't believe those boys did it. I believe they were rail roaded for simply being different. And I believe to this day had HBO not kept an eye on what  was happening there those boys would still be behind bars. I also think it was a deads to right indicatior the boys didn't do it by the fact the judicial system made them plead guilty before releasing them. It makes me sick what happened there. Please keep in mind this is only my opinion but if you want a balanced and informed way to decide on how you feel about the West Memphis 3 you should watch this.,1403740800,2,1415,4.1046931407942235

5427898,4,B00AIBZKFG,"I remember the West Memphis murders. I was a new mother and watched the trial unfold in the media, and like many others, I believed the three teenagers who were convicted were guilty. My opinion changed over time, and this documentary does a very good job at explaining why.

The film starts slowly with detailed accounts of the crime, arrests, trial and convictions. The facts of the case are presented in a detached style with no overt displays of bias, and It took about 30 minutes before the subject of alternate theories and evidence are broached. At that point, the film takes a sharp turn and it's clear where viewers are being led.

The film does a good job depicting and dissecting the moral hysteria that struck the community, and shines a spotlight on flaws and unethical practices within the legal system. Major players in the case are re-interviewed - including several witnesses who admit they lied to authorities. Jurors are questioned, along with family members of the victims.

Despite the strengths, the documentary left me uneasy. The film denounces rush to judgments, but seems to do just that by pointing an accusing finger at a man who hasn't been charged, much less found guilty.

I'd also warn that graphic crime scene and autopsy photos are present throughout - including images of the three little boys being pulled naked from the marsh.",1403136000,2,1363,4.862068965517241

5428002,3,B00AIBZKFG,"I teach history at the university level. I have been using the first documentary in the Paradise Lost trilogy in the classroom for about eight years. While there is some previously unused footage in West of Memphis, the major difference for me between this film and the Berlinger/Sinofsky documentaries is the pace and perspective. West of Memphis jumps all around the timeline, from the trial to prison and back again - that alone makes West of Memphis unusable for my purposes because that is one hell of a spoiler, frankly. When I show the documentary to students, they feel confident that the trial will end in acquittal before the end of the movie. (Usually only a few of them know about the case a priori because the only news they get is Jon Stewart, otherwise they'd know all about the case outcomes from NPR etc.). Their rage, confusion, bafflement, and fear when they discover that the WM3 get sent to prison is what I want as part of their learning outcome; I teach the case in a unit on the early modern witch craze, and have students compare the WM3 trial to those of European cases and Salem. It robs them of their complacency, their ""it could never happen now, it could never happen here"" - and I *want* them not to feel complacent, I want them to be aware and alert and to participate in what's happening in their communities and states. The first documentary builds from the discovery of the bodies to the trial, and ends with the conviction. The camera perspectives and use of interview provide an immersive viewing experience and the documentary has a sense of narrative continuity. I would not want to show West of Memphis to someone unfamiliar with the case, they'd be confused as hell about the when/where of things as the narrative position on the timeline jumps all around. Also, and I do not get this one tiny bit, West of Memphis has the weirdest score I think I've ever heard in a documentary. It's sort of subliminal until you notice it, but once you do it will make you insane, because it's basically like a Bach fugue slowed down by 100x playing continuously in the background, so it's just one note for two minutes, then another note for two minutes, and so on. I'm sure it's supposed to feel melancholy or something, but it's just incredibly annoying. It's like having someone saying ""DURRRRRRRRRRRR"" in the background all the time, with slight variations in pitch. I hate to neg the movie; I wanted to like it, but I couldn't make it. I could not believe it was possible to make the story of the WM3 so relentlessly boring, because heaven knows it is NOT. All I can say is that if you're wanting to teach one of the four documentaries in a classroom, choose the first one, because all of your students will spend the next few free hours they can grab doing research to find out what happened when and how this could happen and etc. - if you want a summary of the case stripped off all the bizarre color and community context and crime scene footage and weird people, get this. I think the filmmakers wanted to remove all of that from the story in order to make claims about the justice system without all the weirdo West Memphis people making it look like something that happened in Crazytown (and could only happen in Crazytown). I think that's a bad choice. Witch hunts happen when communities go insane, and it's not actually that hard to tip them over, especially if they're uneducated, especially if they're religiously fundamentalist, especially if they're isolated, etc. - to me, that's an incredibly important takeaway. Smoothing off all those edges, showing all the people who were involved in a retrospective view that makes them look repentant and rational, taking away the nightmarish carnivalesque atmosphere of the whole thing... Makes the story less scary, and more like Just Another Miscarriage of Justice instead of what it really was: an actual witch hunt, in America, in the 20th century, which nearly cost three young men their freedom, and for one of them - his life.  You will get a better sense of the human element, the community dynamic, the time and place, and the energy that runs through the events culminating in the trial with the first  documentary. In my opinion, it is the best and most powerful of all four films.",1393718400,28,4280,4.66005291005291

5428009,5,B00AIBZKFG,"For those that would like some insight on how the US Justice System mostly works, then this is the doc for you. Don't even think that these three innocent men are the only ones rotting in a prison when they have done nothing wrong.  Far too many folks are not given a fair shake and once the word ""Guilty"" is dropped on them, they are ignored and all but forgotten, with appeals taking years and most of those being denied before a judge even looks at the file.
 This particular case garnered so much attention because of the absolute bungling the state of Arkansas performed on the case of the murdered three boys.  Instead of trying to actually solve the crime, they took the easy way out and went full-bore on three teens who had alibis (which were ignored), had never met the boys (didn't matter) and had absolutely no motive (what's that?).  Although I am glad with the release of Damien, Jesse and Jason, I am appalled that they still have to walk with guilt tied around their necks just so Arkansas doesn't have to admit to any wrongdoing.
 Justice in this case will not come if the murderer is not found. On top of that, though, justice will not come until the prosecutor, judge and jurors of the original trial are all behind bars, where they belong.  They ruined three lives based on bigotry and ignorance.  I hope they all rot.",1389052800,3,1338,4.481481481481482

It takes the position that innocence is a foregone conclusion for the three men convicted.  Damien Echols and his wife Lorri are producers of this film, so that tells us something about its bias.

I have yet to see an OBJECTIVE film on this subject.  Between the three Paradise Lost films, and this one, you'd get the impression that everyone involved with law enforcement in Arkansas are inbred hillbillies who arrested the three young men because they wore black clothing.

This film leaves out everything that points to the guilt of the three defendants.  Before the murders, Damien was on Social Security Disability for severe mental illness, and he has a troubling history.  He apparently beat and kicked a Great Dane to death and stomped on its head because he wanted to see if its eyeballs would pop out.  Of course, this doesn't prove he murdered anyone.

Maybe these three men didn't kill those children.  I hope they didn't.  However, this documentary paints an overly flattering portrait of all three and does not include any factors which point to their guilt.  The only time that evidence is referred to in this film is in a mocking tone which makes the prosecutors look like they don't have two brain cells to rub together.",1381536000,3,1344,4.745689655172414

I FINALLY got smart and contacted some people who understood and pointed me in the right direction. I FINALLY received the correct Blu-Ray today, and WOW. But before I go there, let me talk about what is happening with some used and purportedly new copies of this film, AND OTHER FILMS being sold on Amazon. What I received two times in a row, from two different sellers were RENTAL COPIES. They look exactly like the actual retail version; same packaging, same disc label art and a similar opening menu (I say similar, because the menu indicates no special features) ... with ONE HUGE DIFFERENCE! What I and others have received contains absolutely NO SPECIAL FEATURES, other than trailers that you cannot skip over. I decided to contact SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT and was able to speak to a very kind and helpful man in the home entertainment consumer affairs department. Within ten minutes he concluded that what I had purchased from two different sellers, one that was actually shrink-wrapped, was re-packaged rental copies. He also explained that this is happening a lot on Amazon and in other on-line venues and stores that sell used media as well. Many sellers on Amazon indicate whether or not a used Blu-Ray is a RENTAL version. In both instances my sellers did NOT. Either they were completely unaware of what they were selling or KNEW IT, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they did NOT know. In both cases, I was quickly given a refund. One more thing: I was asked by SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT to take pictures of the discs, including the packaging, so they can determine whether or not these are actually rental copies or bootleg versions.

I also took my case to Amazon and once again I spoke to a really kind and helpful person in the help department. They explained exactly how I could get the version that is genuine retail and includes all the special features, and it makes perfect sense: Order a copy DIRECTLY from and SOLD BY AMAZON, otherwise you are taking a chance that you will not get the version you actually ordered. I would advise anyone ordering used copies to request that the seller checks to see what version you are getting. Enough said, now for the review.

""West of Memphis"" is the fourth feature film to continue the story of three young men who were victims of a bizarre legal system; convicted of the positively horrible murder of three little Arkansas boys. While the HBO films were certainly compelling, although a bit over-the-top and insensitive in spots, ""West Of Memphis"" is far better organized and offers some startling new material, instead of re-hashing old stuff. That statement is not a criticism of the HBO trilogy. I found the trilogy to be nothing short of compelling, and ultimately shocking. What I didn't find in the HBO trilogy is a humanistic approach to the story. What impacted me so much about ""West of Memphis"" was  the powerful focus on the families so deeply affected by the senseless loss and the brutal nature of the tragedy, as well as the loss of freedom and innocence for those wrongfully accused. ""West Of Memphis"" wore me out and left me shaking from emotion. Quite frankly this is one of the very best documentaries I have ever experienced, and its obvious snub-job from Oscar consideration confuses and angers me.

Now, to the SPECIAL FEATURES on this Blu-Ray: The nearly ninety minutes of deleted scenes are another film in itself, and nothing short of spellbinding in their importance to this evolving story. I couldn't budge from my seat during this segment of the special features. In itself, the deleted scenes could be a separate retail item that I would gladly pay for. But the extras on the correct disc don't end there; There is about an hour of Toronto Film Festival panel discussions, along with three additional featurettes and the trailer. To be a fan of this film and NOT be able to have the Special Features as well, is unthinkable. For my money, this is one of the best and most feature-heavy and informative Blu-Rays to date; totally worthy of being called a ""Special Edition.""",1381449600,5,4234,4.733062330623306

Officialdom's praise of totally biased discrimination means there is no person in this state safe before the law.  These young men, jailed  for years for a crime they could not have committed, survived with grace and poise. That their many supporters continued to battle for their cause was uplifting and ennobling.  Altogether a fine example of heroism.

5428076,4,B00AIBZKFG,"Just as is likely for most people watching this movie, I saw Paradise Lost when it first was on HBO and subsequently watched the two sequels. For all these years I've been shocked and saddened about the injustice of this case, not only because of the lack of a fair trial for these three boys but also because the real killer(s) remains unknown.

I have also grown up a lot over the past 20 years, just as Demian has (we are the same age) and I agree with what he says in this movie that, sadly, injustice like this is much more common in the US than any of us would like to think. This is one of the reasons why the middle of the movie bothers me.

It is not for this movie to put Terry Hobbs on trial. Perhaps it's a terrible wrong that the police seem to turn away from the possibility that he needs to be more thoroughly investigated. That could certainly be the case. But that presumption is not worthy of a gigantic chunk of this movie because a film cannot function effectively as a courtroom and the audience is certainly not a jury.

Would you like to be put on trial the way Terry Hobbs was in this film? Have a director editing and manipulating all the visual and quotes about your possible involvement in something from 20 years ago? Taking your DNA when you are out of the room for a moment? Maybe it's easy after the Paradise Lost movies to pretend that a film can function as a courtroom and audience can play jury. Maybe we feel like we all played a part (as audience and advocates) for the West Memphis 3. Maybe so. But these feelings are not facts and in this particular forum after the interminable witch hunt and its catastrophic consequences, this seems irresponsible.

I gave this movie four stars because I so loved the ending. Last Spring I saw Demian Echols walking in a SoHo (I live in NYC) and it completely made my day just to glimpse him finally free in the world on a beautiful day. For me, that was a glorious thing to see. I watched this movie because I wanted to see the day he, Jason, and Jesse got out of prison and some of what came after. It was worthy of four stars from me to see that.",1380240000,3,2124,4.237037037037037

5428080,3,B00AIBZKFG,"While most of the time you'll read these reviews and learn of the newest blockbuster to make it's way to DVD I like to occasionally post something a little different. It might be an unknown movie that was just released or even a foreign film you might never have heard of. And on occasion I talk about documentaries.

I'm very wary of documentaries for one reason. Documentaries are never unbiased. Each film made is created by someone with a point of view who then attempts to convince you that what they believe is true. This has increased in recent years and gone so far as to have someone like film maker Michael Moore re-edit conversations, complete false data and more only to win an Academy Award after doing so. Suffice to say when it comes to documentaries I'm a bit of a skeptic.

They can prove interesting though and such is the case with the release of WEST OF MEMPHIS. If you've never heard of the Memphis Three don't fret. The opening sequence of this film will rehash the story from the beginning. It's the true story of three young boys who on May 5th, 1993, were murdered. The story unfolds in interviews with one of the boy's mother as well as others who were there at the time and then combines that with news footage taken at the time.

In search of the killer/killers of these children a few rumors led to the arrest of three teenagers, Jessie Misskelly, Jason Baldwin and Damien Echolls, based solely on the fact that others thought them strange and involved in satanic rituals. Their arrest was coupled with a confession of one of the boys which led in turn to more speculation as well as false evidence eventually ending in their conviction. From all appearances as you watch this, it seems as if they were indeed guilty.

The case of these boys, who became known as the Memphis Three since that's where they came from, garnered the attention of the press and select celebrities who sympathized with their case. This is perhaps the weakest point of this documentary. It would have been enlightening to find out why these celebrities took the case to heart. Was it contact with people fighting for the boys and if so was it new evidence or just sympathy that led them there? This isn't shown but in any case people like Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam joined the bandwagon in trying to have the verdict overturned and the three released.

Those who believed in their innocence went on to make three different documentaries about the case, each titled PARADISE LOST (1, 2 and 3 respectively), that tried to paint a picture of their innocence and shift the blame on to someone else, occasionally ruining the lives of others who were touched by this tragedy. Perhaps the strongest supporter of them all was Lorri Davis who began corresponding with the Echolls, eventually marrying him. Her determination found her contacting lawyers and celebrities in the hopes of making things happen.

As the story unfolds the mishandling of the case is presented from manipulation of the press to twisting the words of mentally challenged Misskelly to make him sound guilty. The state's refusal to grant a new trial or to even hear new evidence as the years went by makes for a compelling case to free the boys. The film offers the evidence as well as a reasonable scenario as to who the real killer was. But was all of this enough to get them released? If you don't know the answer, watch the film.

The story makes for an interesting film that holds your attention from start to finish. Most people will blindly assume this is all that needs to be said. Other will criticize the facts left out about the boys that led to their becoming suspects to begin with. This is where the biased opinions of a film maker become apparent. In omitting those details it makes it appear as though there was something to hide, making them no better than the prosecutors they portray as manipulative. For me I believe you present the entire story and let the viewer decide based on that.

The movie does make a great case for displaying a sloppy judicial system that isn't perfect, a law enforcement organization that wants to close a case rather than find the guilty and shows that when people get involved perhaps the truth will come out. But not all judges are terrible, not all law enforcement people are bad and sometimes even the truth can get twisted. Go in knowing this and you'll find an interesting movie that hopes to make sense of the case of the Memphis Three.",1378944000,5,4460,4.615384615384615

5428142,3,B00AIBZKFG,"I have been a supporter of Jason Baldwin, Jessie Misskelley, and Damien Echols since the three of them were accused, tried, and convicted. I have been very vocal about my support where I live, which is Jonesboro, Arkansas. After the convictions, I wrote all three men and told them I was certain they had convicted the wrong people. I was a college student at the time and had no idea there were other supporters interested in the case. Then I simply typed in their names and I was led to WM3.org. There, I became acquainted with other supporters and the basic founder of an important support base:  Kathy Bakken, Burk Sauls, Grove Pashley, and Lisa Fancher. I cannot begin to explain their impact on this case and the hard work they, and other supporters, have done. These four were the people who began the movement to strive toward truth and justice, not Arkansas Take Action as this documentary would have led one to believe.

The documentary served as a basic 'how to' type of information for one not well acquainted with the case. I felt that Amy Berg spent far too much time speaking to 'celebrity' supporters such as Eddie Vedder, Natalie Maines, and to a lesser degree, Henry Rollins. It seemed as if no one else but celebrities were supporters, which is horribly untrue. Of course, the documentary showed supporters at various intervals, but did not bother to mention Bakken, Sauls, Pashley, or Fancher outside of a WM3.org sticker on the bumper of what I assumed was Lorri Davis' vehicle. Not that I have anything against Ms. Davis or Mara Leveritt. Both have shown extreme dedication. However, so have other supporters around the globe. In fact, when I saw the case unfolding before my very eyes, I was there from the beginning. I am not saying focus should have been placed on me, and that Berg aspired to focus more on the new evidence than supporters. Yet, at the same time, Arkansas Take Action were shown in a manner to lead folks not familiar with the case to assume they were the meat of the supporter movement, and the celebrities were also interviewed more than anyone else.

Arkansas Take Action claimed once to be THE support group in Arkansas. A little education, folks, is that from what I understand, ATA didn't become involved with the case until 2007. THE support group here in Arkansas and over various parts of the globe was begun by Bakken, Sauls, Pashley, and Fancher. I have also heard that most of ATA never contributed money to the convicted in prison or funds for the Defense Fund begun by Lorri Davis in the late '90s. What they were good at was seducing the press. If cameras were there, so were they, only briefly. During Baldwin and Misskelley's Rule 37 hearing, this 'dedicated' group showed up ONCE to view the proceedings for approximately fifteen minutes, spending more time conversing with the press than actually observing the hearings. Also, none of them spoke directly to Misskelley and more with Baldwin. It was as if they somehow blamed Misskelley for the convictions of Baldwin and Echols. The entire situation was corrupt [not ATA specifically], but the investigation and interviews conducted by the West Memphis Police Department.

I have never met Damien Echols, although I send him positive messages through Twitter, as I have heard he is often attacked. When the Rule 37 was happening in 1998 for him, the deputies would not allow interaction between the 'peanut gallery.' In the latest hearings for Baldwin and Misskelley, the deputies were somewhat more lenient, and supporters could speak to both men. After doing so [thanks Lisa for introducing me], I learned that no one could have actually believed these guys were guilty. I'm not a 'babe in the woods' type person, as I have done social work in my career and was schooled to look out for lying. Not that I believed they were guilty, but if anyone would have spent some time with either, they would have been convinced.

Berg did an educational documentary for those unschooled with the basics of the case. I felt she ignored the main supporter movement, and wish she had done more with the pioneers. Although I adore Mara Leveritt and have always found Lorri Davis to be quite pleasant and dedicated to her husband and the case, I would not have wanted to associate with ATA. I didn't. The film left much to be desired. I have extreme sympathy for the Hicks,' Moore's, and Byers' family. I also have the same feelings toward the families of the convicted. One day, I hope that either the three men are exonerated or the West Memphis Police Department would act like a professional organization instead of the Keystone Cops. If they had taken steps to be more careful and cautious, this case might have turned out differently. Instead, their so-called 'motive' was that it had been perpetrated by a Satanic cult. Anyone with knowledge of the occult would have easily found this not to be true. The FBI should have, if at all possible, been consulted more. The work of Dr. Perretti was completely slanted toward the prosecution. The defense for the three convicted did not have the opportunity or funds to pursue other opinions about the killings. The one true hero from the defense team was Judge Dan Stidham. He is an amazing man and humanitarian. He is also still dedicated to the case. It has been mentioned that these murders were the work of 'thrill killers.' Simply not true. The site where the bodies were found was near a set of apartments and a busy highway. The crime scene was too neat, as if the killer(s) had beaten the victims and dumped them in the ditch. Thrill killers aren't very concerned with hiding what they've done, they want the world to see it, and they make sure of it. And yes, I consider my opinion valued, since I have extensively studied Criminology and absorb any type of material that relates to these types of killings.

Further, Dale Griffis should not call himself an occult expert. His 'expertise' seems to lean toward the ridiculous. Further, the 'evidence' against the three is non-existent outside Misskelley's false confessions. When speaking to Misskelley, it is quite obvious he is extremely suggestible and will insert himself in any story one tells him so he can please the listener. Berg failed to speak much to Misskelley or Baldwin. The focus was geared more toward Echols. I can also understand that. After all, he was the one on death row with a ticking clock. The documentary is an attention grabber, for sure, but seasoned supporters won't truly hear any earth shattering differences that Berlinger and Sinofsky portrayed in the three documentaries they presented. Mara Leveritt has done incredible work, and if not for her tenacity, most of the people who are supporters would never have gotten interested. It was more or less Berlinger, Sinofsky, Bakken, Sauls, Pashley, Fancher, and Leveritt who spearheaded the supporter movement, knowing well the obstacles they were forced to jump over whether they liked it or not.

In the beginning of this case, especially in Arkansas, if one was a supporter and vocal, there were terrible consequences. People lost jobs, friends, and received verbal abuse. The tide has turned completely. When once it was considered 'stupid' to be a supporter, today, it almost seems 'fashionable.' More attention is never a bad thing, unless it is carried out in a negative fashion. And it has been. I applaud Berg and the people who helped her compile this film. I only wish she had done more with Misskelley and Baldwin. I worry about them all, of course, but Misskelley continues to be the one of whom I worry most. He doesn't have the support base [in their personal lives] that Baldwin and Echols has. I feel badly for them all, but Jessie Misskelley remains on my mind the most. I am ecstatic they are free, living their lives, and trying to rebuild a shattered existence for so many unnecessary years. Berg's attempt falls short, and I wish she had done more. Some of us did not become involved in the case after watching documentaries. There were many of us there, on the front lines, and doing whatever we could.",1378771200,2,8112,4.79

5428174,3,B00AIBZKFG,"WEST of MEMPHIS is a very compelling documentary about a huge--and not as uncommon as we'd like to think--miscarriage of justice. The most haunting aspect of the film is how guilty the ""Memphis 3"" appear during the trial, yet how innocent they seem once certain facts emerge afterward. No matter what really happened in this particular case, WEST of MEMPHIS succeeds in showing how completely innocent people can be routinely convicted of the most heinous crimes imaginable due to corruption and human error, some of it understandable, some of it otherwise. The ease at which prosecutors motivated by their own ""professional"" or political agendas can distort the truth and elicit confessions from the innocent yet vulnerable is truly bone-jarring. Most of us want to believe in the fundamental integrity of America's justice system, which is why cases such as this are so irksome.

Having said all of this, I must add the following caveat: It's still entirely possible that the Memphis 3 were guilty all along. I found this film very persuasive at first, but a little further investigation into the matter revealed many new aspects, with much conflicting evidence, to this story. WEST of MEMPHIS really stacks the cards in covering only the ""these poor, innocent, misunderstood boys"" side of things.

This documentary is long and often repetitively detailed, which is nevertheless helpful in allowing the audience to understand how everything supposedly happened. Still, it may prove a little ponderous for the more casual viewer. There are some very disturbing images--crime scene photos of the eight-year-old victims, etc--as well as blunt descriptions of the mutilations done to the bodies.

5428177,5,B00AIBZKFG,"What, one could argue, could possibly be added to story of the West Memphis Three which wasn't covered in the Paradise Lost Trilogy?  After finally watching West of Memphis, this viewer can emphatically state, ""TONS!""

It is important to note that I think West of Memphis and the Paradise Lost films cannot and should not be compared.  Both are excellent.  The Paradise Lost films are more about a horrific crime and an unfolding story - did they do it or did they not?  Especially in the first film, it is impossible not to be moved by the pain of the families of the murdered children.  West of Memphis obviously recounts the crime, but comes from a stance that the WM3 are innocent and how justice might be achieved for them.

Like many of you, I watched Paradise Lost the first time it aired on HBO.  I remember seeing film-makers Berlinger & Sinofsky on the Today show in advance, telling that they went to film the trial because they were both parents of young children and they wanted to find answers as to how children could so brutally kill other children.  They said they came away with a story other than the one they went to film - indeed they did.

Also like many of you, I bought vhs copies, then later dvd copies of the Paradise Lost movies, joined the Free the WM3 site, bought the t-shirts, read the books, etc.  This case wouldn't let go.  What West of Memphis delves into is all of the new evidence findings (yes, addressed somewhat in Paradise Lost II), and delving into it in great depth. West of Memphis goes into much greater detail of what the missed evidence was, where it was found and it answers a really big question of where was all the blood from the injuries on the bodies of the little boys?  If the kill site was different, how could killer/killers transport victims from a kill site to a dump site without anyone seeing? And what about the serrated knife that magically appeared in the lake behind Jason's home? For me so many of the evidentiary questions were finally answered - except the ""who did it?""  Although the film makes a very strong case for the guilt of Terry Hobbs as the killer of the boys, likely we will never know - the state of Arkansas' prosecutorial representatives make it pretty clear this case is closed as far as Arkansas is concerned.

West of Memphis also goes into more detail about who the WM3 are as adult men.  There are more interviews with them in this film than likely were allowed by the prisons in the Paradise Lost films. Especially the interviews with Jesse Misskelly in the extras of WOM moved me tremendously. This film also shows the phalanx of high profile lawyers required and brought on board (thanks to the support from a lot of people, including some generous famous folks with some pretty deep pockets) to argue and advocate for these guys.

For me West of Memphis and the Paradise Lost films are integral parts of the same piece - not just because they are dealing with the same case, but because they each tell a different, critical part of this story from completely different vantage points. That being said, they are both stand-alone films, each excellent.

Ever doubt the power of film and its ability to bring about change?  Imagine where the WM3 would be without that first Paradise Lost film.  Damien would likely already have been executed by now, a footnote on the evening news.  Jason and Jesse would be lost in the penal system, remembered only by their families.  Instead these films forced the rest of us to make a personal choice to either get involved and speak up or just look away.  West of Memphis showed what could happen when a bright light is shown on something dark and ugly and what could be done when we speak up.  Although I hate they had to invoke the Alford plea to get out, I am just so glad that Damien, Jason and Jesse ARE out.

The first time I went to Memphis, TN, I crossed the bridge over the Mississippi and found myself in sad, poor West Memphis, Arkansas.  Memphis, TN with its museums, culture and bright lights must have seemed a universe away to those young men back in 1993.  Today, they can go anywhere!",1376870400,3,4127,4.519515477792732

If you have not seen the PARADISE LOST titles, WEST OF MEMPHIS is a shortcut to learning about that egregious injustice.

Innocent people are imprisoned for cultural and political purposes all the time in America.  As WEST OF MEMPHIS depicts, the three young men were sent to jail for both reasons in West Memphis, Arkansas.",1376784000,3,666,4.824561403508772

5428180,5,B00AIBZKFG,"This is a great documentary for anyone.  Those like myself who have followed this case since the first documentary will find some repeat information however also really new insight into whom I believe is the real killer; Terry Hobbs!  Those who did not follow the case will even be more amazed at the injustice since this film covers it from beginning to end and unfortunately while thankfully all three are free they had to cop an Alfred Plea to get out.  They are all innocent of these atrocious crimes; they were children themselves when they happened and it was a total witch hunt. The attorney for Jason was really ridiculous because certainly they should have had that soft spoken cute little child take the stand and speak for himself.  Damien was also innocent but at an attitude that could be mistaken for guilty by an overeager jury and entire state that wanted somebody to pay the price for the horrific deaths of three innocent little boys.  As for Jessie he was borderline retarded and only after the cops told him everything to say did he finally ""confess"" because he just wanted to get out of the interrogation room!!  He didn't even know the times the crimes were committed, nothing!!  Forcing the three to take the Alfred Plea was cowardly and a crime in and of itself for robbing these three boys of their entire youth; they were all just teenagers when they were locked up for a crime they did not commit and when they got out they were grown men and the state almost put somebody to death that did nothing wrong and that would have been murder!!  Luckily they are still relatively young being in their thirties and can have families of their own.  I find Jason to have a particularly incredible attitude considering the completely unjust circumstances.  I used to think Mark Byers was guilty but he turned out to be a stand up guy and actually taking a lie detector test (and passing ) totally on film indicated his innocence.  It isn't generally the one in the spot light but the quiet guy in the corner hiding from the media that turns up as the guilty one.  These type of crimes are almost always an inside job; somebody in the family or close to the family and this film showed clearly that Terry Hobbs was lying about not seeing the boys that night and the neighbor with no bone in the fight said she saw Terry with them!!  DNA goes to further prove his guilt.  He should be arrested and tried.  There is enough evidence in my opinion even after all this time for a conviction.  Even Pam his ex wife has major doubts about him today.  I recommend this film highly; it will teach you about the justice system and how in certain cases such as this one it seriously can let you down.",1376611200,3,2705,4.4989775051124745

5428222,5,B00AIBZKFG,"I started to watch the trilogy produced for HBO years ago called ""Paradise Lost"" about the West Memphis 3 murder trial but never found time to finish it. This movie - in its 2 hours and 27 minutes, not only held my attention, but brought the case up to date (well as up to date as September 2012 when it premiered. I guess you could read other reviews here and finds out how it ends but, if you've read my many other Amazon reviews, you know I'm not a believer in ""spoilers"" so, unless you have sen Paradise Lost or know the story of the case, I'm going to suggest that you go in knowing nothing except that the documentary follows the case of three 16 year old boys who are charged with the grisly murder of three eight-year old boys in Arkansas and serve 18 years in prison. Whether they are guilty or not - and whether the real killer is still loose will be revealed by the end, and Director Amy Berg unravels the story so the film doesn't seem as long as it actually is.

The difference between this film and HBO's Paradise Lost is that this film was made because of both financial support  - and, later, participation in, by such A-list celebrities as Director Peter Jackson, actor Johnny Depp, rocker Eddie Vedder and Country Music activist Natalie Maines (who actually drawn into the case because of a lawsuit).

There are other lengthy reviews here to read if you want but I'll just say I recommend it and concentrate on the DVD and Bluray bonus features - which are substantial.
Both the BD and DVD have eight deleted scenes. Usually ""deleted scenes"" are short. Here they run nearly 87 minutes! The two formats also have five short ""RE-creations "" of defendant Damien Echols' past life.

The Bluray adds a fulm length commentary with Echols, his wife and the director (I did not listen to this) as well as two events from the premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2012. The first is a Red Carpet Q&A and a panel discussion which includes Maines and Depp plus a recorded intro to the film by Jackson. This runs about 12 minutes. Then there is a 38-minute press conference with Echols, his wife, and the Director in attendance, plus Jackson via satellite. The questions covered in these two sessions do overlap a lot but are still worth watching.
So you can either choose to watch just the film - and you will remain riveted to the screen, or dig deeper, if you choose, with the bonus features. Either way, you will look upon the criminal justice system in the State of Arkansas with new eyes after watching this excellent film.

I hope you found this 5review both informative and helpful.

5428267,5,B00AIBZKFG,"I have to give this documentary 5 stars because it was even more riveting, thought-provoking and devastating than the original Paradise Lost film which I saw on HBO when it first came out in 1996. Though a bit long and drawn out in parts (should have been edited down to make it a neat 2 hours) I simply could not stop watching. I have never been convinced one way or the other about this case. On the one hand, I thought the evidence against the WM3 as presented in Paradise Lost and several of the books written about the case was minimal, I don't think I ever lost sight of the fact that 3 beautiful little children were viciously ripped from the world by someone and, putting the evidence together as it was presented by the prosecution, I could understand why the 3 were found guilty. This film doesn't gloss over that evidence or pretend it didn't exist but carefully and precisely dissects that original evidence presented in the prosecution's case to illustrate how it was misinterpreted, misrepresented and used to paint a picture of what they thought likely happened, NOT what was, in fact, the truth.

Motivated by electoral pressure, hearsay and ignorance, the state of Arkansas concocted a scenario (which ends up being proven wrong in this film) fueled by Jerry Driver, a 'Satanic cult' specialist and an unlicensed medical examiner who worked for the prosecution. Putting these things together, the prosecution produced this satanic scenario and made Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley fit this profile along with the so-called ritualistic wounds that were purportedly present on the victims. These wounds were misinterpreted to be evidence of sexual assault and ritualized murder from the start, based on the penile mutilation of one of the victims. West of Memphis analyzes these wounds and proves that they were post-mortem and NOT inflicted by the killer or killers. This fact alone puts the kybosh on the theory of satanic sacrifice altogether and demonstrates that not only were investigators jumping to conclusions from jumpstreet, but also that they didn't rule out any other possible explanation for what had happened to these boys if it did not fit their Satanic vision.

On the other side of this, before I saw this film, I still had my doubts about the innocence of the WM3. Again, based on hearsay and others' interpretations of evidence, I still felt it was possible that they were, in fact, guilty. Years ago when I heard that many celebs were coming forward to support these men and I saw all the new-found interest in the case I wondered if all the public support and outcries about injustice were based on celebrity involvement. (Wow, Eddie Vedder believes these guys are innocent and I love Eddie Vedder so they MUST be!! or  Johnny Depp is friends with Damien Echols and I LOVE Johnny Depp and he must be right because he's so famous and hot and I want to be involved with what he's involved with etc. etc.) I didn't want to be one of these people who were jumping on some new pop-culture band-wagon so I remained neutral in my stance that the WM3 might be innocent but then again, they might very well be guilty.

Watching this film, changed that for me. West of Memphis breaks down the case bit by bit and points out exactly where the major mishaps occurred within the prosecution's original case. Some of these 'mishaps' were the result of bad politics, lousy investigative protocol and plain old ignorance. These errors could be considered similar to the messes that were made of the Simpson and JonBenet Ramsey investigations and deemed as products of human error. But, in this case, it is obvious that there was much malicious intent on the part of the prosecution, illustrated best by the prosecution's insistence that the knife found in the lake behind the Baldwin home was the murder weapon, when they knew for certain that, in fact, it couldn't have been. This film has many of these a-ha moments where you come to realize that these 3 men weren't victims of circumstance but of blatant and deliberate prosecutorial misconduct.

Yes, I've been online and have read through the West Memphis Three facts site that claim to have scores of evidence proving the 3 to be guilty. The only problem there is, how do we know ANY of that is true? More lies, more hearsay, more people talking about what they heard someone said or what they heard was found in Damien Echols' bedroom etc. etc. This film on the other hand, displays the facts and truths of this case that so many of us haven't heard. For instance, Jesse Miskelley's confession is scrutinized step by step and shows without question that he was coerced and led towards a confession by investigators hell-bent on getting an admission of guilt. Jessie's story is 100% hogwash and this film proves that.

The investigation done by WM3 supporters into the questionable character of Terry Hobbs paints a very disturbing picture of what is a much more likely scenario about how these boys were murdered. An abusive step-father accidentally beats his step-son to death and does it while his two friends are either present or somewhere in the house as eye or ear witnesses. The father has to get rid of them or they will tell what he did to his step-son. The father kills the other two, ties them up and dumps their bodies and bikes in the river. However, though this all does make sense and does point the finger at Hobbs, the only evidence that he was involved is a piece of his hair found entwined in one of the boy's ligatures.  He may actually have been the one who did this to these children but then again, maybe not.

The state of Arkansas could care less about justice for these murdered boys. They are indifferent to the fact that 3 men spent 20 years in prison though they were innocent. They are simply concerned with pleasing the public and not looking like Mayberry morons for grossly manipulating the law. The Alford Plea takes care of all that. The WM3 get their freedom, the state can say that they got the right guys because they 'plead guilty' to the murders, they can wash their hands of all future lawsuits and they don't have to investigate or look for the real killer, which makes Hobbs, guilty or not, basically immune to investigation by the state of Arkansas.

To be fair though, I still would have liked to have heard a definitive cause of death for these boys. At one point, John Douglas (FBI profiler) says that they were put into the water alive. I'm not sure I buy that. If it is true, then I would have liked a certain explanation of what they believe happened. I never heard that these boys had water in their lungs. In fact, I thought it was later a universally agreed-upon fact that the boys were murdered elsewhere and the river was simply a dumping ground. This doesn't jive with that. So yet another question that should have a simple answer but does not. Not sure why.

In the end, this film is heart and gut-wrenching and disturbing to say in the least. It sheds new light on a story you may think you already know well and will make you sick to your stomach when you find out exactly how the wheels of justice in this country often turn. The gratification of seeing the WM3 finally see freedom makes it all worth it, although you won't watch the end credits with any sense of true justice here. Three little boys were murdered 17 years ago. Three other little boys spent their youth and young adulthood behind bars and lost a quarter of their lives for nothing. Prosecutors were re-elected, judges moved higher up on the political ladder, none have accepted or acknowledged their role in any wrongdoing and still, we have no justice for three little boys. Sadly, this film's greater message is that the state of Arkansas lost sight of their duty to ensure justice for three little boys and blundered on all levels of ethics and politics when their focus became not on Stevie, Michael or Christopher but on a different set of 3 who will, according to the state of Arkansas, now always be considered murderers.",1375747200,48,8034,4.68342776203966
5428268,4,B00AIBZKFG,"Perhaps it is because I know too much about the case?  I have seen all movies and shows on the case and read everything available online and so the first hour was a yawnfest.  After that it got interesting with the focus on discrediting the case and then on Hobbs -- but I think there are portions of this that would have benefited from being narrated -- such as the scene with the turtles.  While I ""got"" the inferences presented by the director, I am sure that there are many people who did not and it would have helped if she got a doctor to look at the wounds on the dead pig and compare them to the boys wounds in the photos.  Another section that would have benefitted from narration to put the scenes into context was the scene with the female juror -- did she sit down and listen to all of the new evidence regarding the crimes? Was she given information showing that there was no DNA connection to the crimes?  Or, did she review all of the new information and she still feels the same way today as she did in 1993 and why is that ???  WHat would she have liked to have seen or known in the trial that might have changed her vote ?  (Also would have helped if you could find another juror who has an opposite view today than he or she did in 1993 and why the juror changed their mind -- it would have shown balance AND depict the controversy as it stands today -- a house divided for whatever reasons they believe the way that they do).  Applause should be given for tracking down Michael Carson and at least getting some perspective from him regarding why he would say what he did on the witness stand (although he does not admit that he lied for obvious reasons (I believe that the state would try to prosecute for perjury if they could) he did actually apologize to Jason Baldwin for what it was worth today).  Applause also for the pursuit of Terry Hobbs in showing the many places that he lied and getting him on tape with David Jacoby was the BEST part of the movie -- Hobbs tells Jacoby that when the three are released that the state is preparing two new death row cells and it sent chills up my spine just WAITING for Terry Hobbs to slip and say something like ""so you need to stick to your story and I will stick to mine -- that we were together ALL night long with very few or no gaps in the timeline !"" -- and although it was not said, it was pretty much inferred in that conversation.  Up to this point, Jacoby had been somewhat of a ""lost link"" and Berg did a good job with him and showing how he felt about it all for all of these years and the portions with Jacoby and the telephone call sealed it for me as far as Hobbs is concerned -- it was even better than the new witnesses with the ""Hobbs family secret"" material.  I found a chill run up my spine.  Another avenue that might have been explored a little better was the reason why Hobbs has not been prosecuted and the supposed ""transfer"" of his and Jacoby's hair to the crime scene.  First, I also believe in innocent transfer of hair in this case -- Hobbs was at Jacobys house and picked up Jacoby's hair from there on his pant leg and then left it at the crime scene (the Jacoby hair was found at shin/ankle level on a nearby bush which Hobbs probably walked by when he was at the crime scene).  That is the ONLY innocent transfer of evidence at that crime scene - david Jacoby was not there but his hair ended up being innocently transported there by Terry Hobbs. The other hair -- Terry Hobbs hair -- ended up in a much more sinister place for obvious reasons.  Narration would have helped here with an exploration of several convicted murderers and what evidence the state had on each of those murderers to show that in many instances, convictions are obtained with much LESS evidence than exists against Terry Hobbs in this case (some research could have found comparison cases in several states).  This entire case was shameful and the police and prosecution really dropped the ball when it came to pursuing the most likely and obvious suspect -- a parent or stepparent -- and the fact that they continue to stand by that conviction and would have killed an innocent man is sickening.  Disturbing, really.  Absence of evidence in this case IS the REAL evidence -- there is no way that three teenage boys could have committed a crime like that and not left anything behind at the scene and not taken something from the scene with them on their persons.  This was BEFORE DNA testing was well known and I do not think Damien Echols was a mastermind smart enough to make sure that none of them left anything at the scene (picture this ""Okay boys, we don't know it yet, but in a few years there will be new technology that will reveal who was at a murder scene using the tiniest bit of biological evidence -- so please be careful not to leave any hairs, sweat or skin behind when we do these murders !! ""  COME ON !! Arkansas needs to wake up and my respect for Scott Ellington would grow by leaps and bounds if he would simply reopen this case and bring the real killer to justice.  Overall it was a good telling of the story with a few new items peppered throughout in various spots -- it was a little slow as she went through the background information and it could have benefitted greatly in some spots with narration to pull things together and keep things in context.  THe absence of evidence and the DNA testing should have been explained more (WHY this is so important because I don't think that people really get that point/concept) and comparison cases/evidence should or could have been explored and compared to what there is on Hobbs  (as I said, I am certain there are many cases with a lot LESS damning evidence where the defendant was convicted).",1375747200,3,5743,4.336753731343284
5428269,1,B00AIBZKFG,"I find the reviews for this film fascinating. They're all drinking the kool-aid. If they spent a few minutes researching the facts of this case they would realize how foolish they sound.

West of Memphis, along with the HBO documentary series ""Paradise Lost"" are completely one-sided takes on the Robin Hood Hills murders. It's easy to believe the ""West Memphis Three"" are innocent if you only watch these films, but if you dig deeper you will find that there is overwhelming evidence against them. Obviously you won't find any of that in the film, but everyone has access to testimonies and court transcripts, so hopefully one day someone will make a documentary that gives the full story.

That being said, this film (I won't call it a documentary) - being 100% propaganda, is moderately entertaining. There are some facts presented here, but they ignore other facts, such as Damien having serious mental problems (believing that drinking kool-aid packets gave him powers), having blood of one of the victims on a crucifix he wore, three different knots being used to tie up the boys, absolutely NO alibis for any of the suspects (despite this film claiming otherwise), and it doesn't bring up how Jessie confessed to the crime while he was incarcerated to a girl he had met online who came to visit him, who was a huge supporter of the West Memphis Three, and stopped defending them abruptly.

I'm not saying the West Memphis Three are guilty, but there is significantly more evidence against them than anyone else, and that is why they were convicted. The reason they were set free is because any new jury would be familiar with the documentaries and find them innocent regardless of the facts, so it made sense to save the state millions of dollars.
