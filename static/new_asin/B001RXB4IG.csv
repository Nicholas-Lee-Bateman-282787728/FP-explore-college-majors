8339133,4,B001RXB4IG,"The product itself is great.  We so miss seeing the cartoons on Saturday morning.  This video collection was purchased ""new"" as a Christmas gift for my husband.  Unfortunately, the product was not received in new condition.  I contacted the seller regarding the condition and they did offer me monetary credit.  I told them I needed to wait until after Christmas to check to make sure that the DVD's themselves were in working order & they understood & were very receptive.  The DVD's all worked fine & I requested a specific credit for my order.  The seller, dvdsdeals, gave me the credit I requested.  While I was upset about the condition of the product, dvdsdeals was very understanding & took the appropriate action to make me whole.  I would order from them again.",1301184000,,770,4.7727272727272725
8339134,5,B001RXB4IG,"The description does not quite clarify that this set has no volume #3. Instead... Volume 3 is the set of Looney tune movies. I did not understand this when I bought the set so I was looking everywhere for volume 3... not to mention the fact that I had already bought the movie set separately so now I had 2 copies...

I was just about ready to send an email to customer service about the missing volume #3 (thinking it was a packaging mistake) when I decided to check on the Looney Tune Spotlight set on Wikipedia to see what was supposed to be on that volume. That's where I learned that volume 3 of the set was supposed to be the movies. But it was a little confusing since all of the other volumes were numbered 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 with no 3. Surely they could have taken the time to put the number 3 on that volume to save confusion?

Anyway, if I had not looked on Wikipedia, I would not have known about the 3rd volume of this set being without numbering and listed as the movie collection.

Hopefully, this will help the next person who is confused about volume 3 and save some wasted effort in trying to find out about it.

Otherwise, it is a great set of cartoons. There is also a Looney Tunes golden collection. Wikipedia has a full listing of the Warner brother cartoons and list the names and dates of each by decade. They also include the abbreviations to show you which set of DVD's carries each cartoon... such as LTSC or LTGC and the volume number for reference. It is helpful if you are looking for specific cartoons.

I had to buy the Bugs Bunny Falling hare with the gremlins on a separate DVD (not with either set according to Wikipedia but I'll find out when I've had a chance to watch all of them)... which also has the Ding Dong Daddy cartoon about the dog who was in love with the steel lawn dog statue named Daisy which ends up in an ammunition factory.

For those of you under 40 who are too young to remember... Keep in mind that all of the Pre 50's cartoons were made for adults which played before the movie at the theaters... before the days of TV's. So while kids may enjoy them, the satire is adult. Also, keep in mind that these are the unedited, uncensored copies of these cartoons (at least this is so on the Golden Collection. I have not gone through the spotlight collection yet). So, these cartoons have smoking and racially sensitive characters and WWII subjects... which you may not want your kids to see. But for collectors... we want the cartoons to be uncut and uncensored in their original form.

According to Wikipedia, this spotlight set has less of the sensitive material than the golden collection. So, if you are overly sensitive about what your children watch... you might want to preview the cartoons first. It wasn't until the 50's and later that the cartoons were made for the younger audiences.

However, the satire is great for adults. When I watched them as a child in the 50's, I did not understand the satire, but they were no less enjoyable as a child and the questionable subjects did not have any negative effect on me. I loved them just the same even though I did not get the hidden jokes or parody's. However, when watching the cartoons again as an adult, the satire was a treat to enjoy the second time around.",1300320000,19,3268,4.381188118811881
