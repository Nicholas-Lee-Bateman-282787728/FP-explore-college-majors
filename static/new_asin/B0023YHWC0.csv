8350131,5,B0023YHWC0,"This is my favorite concert by this artist so far. All her concerts on dvd are excellent. Her ability to combine excellent singing with dancing is what separates her from most other artists. Many out there may not know she's also an excellent actress. Check out the movies she made with John Lloyd Cruz. They are excellent. It will also give you the chance to familiarize yourself with some of the people who perform with her as well as some of the theme songs from the movies. If there's one slight negative, it would be the apparent lack of response from the audience at the end of the songs. I don't know if it was editing or perhaps my lack of understanding of the way audiences are over there. These performances would have garnered enthusiastic applause and perhaps standing ovations in the States. I hope sometime in the near future more people in the States discover her. All in all stunning-----just like Sarah's smile.",1388620800,,928,4.664634146341464
