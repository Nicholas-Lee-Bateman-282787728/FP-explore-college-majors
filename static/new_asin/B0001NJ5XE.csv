8015214,5,B0001NJ5XE,A film of a charge of Australian Cavalry in Palestine during World War I difficult to find in video and  DVD,1206316800,,108,4.142857142857143
8015215,5,B0001NJ5XE,"I would like to see this movie. In an effort to draw more attention to it, I gave it 5 stars. If this were a DVD, I would buy it tonight, despite the price tag and the long wait for delivery. If you have seen this movie, please write down your thoughts here.
It sounds very exciting. Should this be a ""Classic"" WWI movie? Unless it receives more attention, it will remain a secret pearl of Australia.
""They were the men of Australia and New Zealand-the ANZACS-the mad bushmen-the men from Down Under."" My husband, who is a gifted historian, knows of these legendary soldiers, but he had never heard of this movie either. We would both like to see it!
I would like to thank firehouse444 for bringing it to my attention in his/her list 'So you'd like to... Find the true gems of Australian cinema !!'. Thanks.",1085011200,15,807,4.422818791946309
