2579387,1,B000FOPPC4,"I knew one day Warner Bros. would put these great movies in Widescreen and thus, help me add them to my shelves. But today is not that day! After seeing this advertised as Widescreen on this website and the Warner Home Video website, I was beside myself with glee and anticipation. I went to four different stores in California, and found that each time I went to purchase, the back of the DVD read, Includes full screen version. Confused I bought it anyway. Thinking maybe the back was a mis-print? Or maybe it meant, includes widescreen and full screen. I was wrong... On both counts! So when I contacted Warner Home Video, and nasty Nurse Ratched answered the phone and told me that ""If I didn't buy it on their website then what did they care that it was being advertised wrongfully"", I knew that these movies would not find a place on my DVD shelves anytime soon.

Buyer beware! This is not only being advertised wrongly but, no one will care once you purchased it!",1156377600,48,970,4.511363636363637
2579388,1,B000FOPPC4,"I've been waiting for years since the LaserDisc release.

What's up with this. Advertised as WS, but on the back clearly states FS.

As Ray Davies said  ... ""Give the People what they want!""

WE DON'T WANT THIS",1156377600,18,210,4.447368421052632
2579389,1,B000FOPPC4,"warner's has sunk to a new level to exploit consumers. this warner's stated ""widescreen"" version is 16x9 or fullscreen (made to fit you tv). i guess if you've already purchased the other releases of this, you'll be up to 5 or 6 copies in your collection when warner's decides they've tricked you as many times as is still profitable, and really releases a widescreen version. this is beyond shameful, and i hope there's some truth to other people's statements of warner's getting sued. someone should be out there helping to protect consumers from companies like this.",1156291200,19,568,4.927083333333333
2579390,1,B000FOPPC4,"This is just ridiculous. The movies ARE in full screen. I called Warner Home Video and some obnoxious woman answered. I explained it was full screen and being advertised as widescreen. She said ""did you buy it from OUR website"" and I said, the upc matched the one in the store. It is the same item and it IS being falsely advertised. Warners is just trying to make a quick buck off this one. She refused to even pass along the information. California is getting a call tomorrow for sure!",1156291200,13,487,4.4222222222222225
2579391,1,B000FOPPC4,"OK, so we had the original release in fullscreen, then the box set in fullscreen, and now finally the widescreen but with both movies on a single disc!  There is obviously no space for all of the extras and outtakes that you will want to see from this cast.  Why does Warner continues to jerk us around?  Because folks buy it when it comes out initially, then they buy again when Warner double-dips with the ""special edition"" or some such nonsense title.  This time, they are going for the triple-dip.  Send them a message by not purchasing this title.",1155513600,9,552,4.5353535353535355
2579392,4,B000FOPPC4,"We've waited a long time for this. Finally in WIDESCREEN! 2-4 disc collector box set would've been nice. I'll pre-order this one.
****UPDATE****
What a waste of time. FULL SCREEN, not WIDESCREEN. Only reason I wanted this set. Amazon has changed the description since then. Now properly says ""Fullscreen"". Wish I hadn't gotten rid of my LD's of both movies in ""LETTERBOX"".  Bummer.........",1149465600,4,389,5.174603174603175

The chemistry between these two actors is fresh and engaging in the first film, which is superior to the second.  However, there are enough moments of humor in the second film (Grumpier Old Men) to more than keep the viewer laughing.  Definitely worth having both films.",1520121600,,396,5.061538461538461

2579497,5,B000FOPPC4,"Walther Matthau and Jack Lemmon play two old geizers who are long time frenemies, battling it out in the matters of the heart and the fishing rod. If they can ever manage to stop competing, they might realize how much they actually care about each other.

I grew up watching these movies, because I am a big fan of the Odd Couple and even those these are not a sequel per se, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau still have that magical chemistry with a similar sense of humor. These movies have a lot of heart. They are not politically correct by any means--there's a lot of misogyny if you pay attention. However, I think the heart of the story, the enduring friendship and loyalty is the message of the movie, and it's a great message. These are great movies for a casual, fun, feel good time.",1488672000,,790,4.410958904109589

Although this is in a nice packaging, it doesn't have the retail packaging as you would see in the store.  The case is flimsy and the DVD has no label.  Almost looked home made.  1-star deduction for packaging and quality.",1468022400,,482,4.5

2579939,5,B000FOPPC4,"1.) Always read the NEW reviews first.
2.) Always go for the Blu-ray... unless there's a DRASTIC price difference.

This is a great double-feature! I'm sure you've already seen one or the other.
Ten bucks for TWO decent movies, in Blu-ray, that is only $2 more than the
same collection on DVD [which ISN'T in w-i-d-e-s-c-r-e-e-n].
BTW, also available, seperately is the more expensive FIRST movie [only],
in Blu-ray. The ""Double"" is half the price of the single movie [?].",1421193600,3,472,4.9

2580159,5,B000FOPPC4,"Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau are a pair of laughs almost from the start of the movie to the end. Its a tale of two people who you could say never really grow up and are always trying to out-compete each other in every way. It is always a pleasure to watch these two ""Grownups"" go at it with each other over women, be it because they want to date them or get ride of them; and the tricks each devise to do this task. Reminds me of my childhood and when I used to come up with ideas and schemes to get out of things myself.

It is funny how they always manage to come together at some points and then a single incident will once again destroy everything again and they will go back to attacking each other like little kids. Always makes me laugh when I watch this movie no matter how many times I watch it.",1398816000,,805,4.03125

While I'm at it.....anyone who has a high def television, GET A BLU RAY PLAYER. If you have a TV that plays 1080 and you're still buyind DVD's, you're wasting your money. That shiny new TV you purchased won't look right without signals from high def sources.

I'm amazed at how little people know about what they're buying when they get these flat screens. My uncle bought a new Plasma then hooked up to a cable box that didn't even have component connections, let alone HDMI. He called me asking why the picture on his new TV looked so bad!

I can hear audio just fine for any other Blu Ray DTS MA or Dolby True HD & any DVD.

My equipment is Panasonic DMP BD 80 Blu Ray player & Pioneer Sc 05 AVR.

My AVR is set to automatically detect the audio format; Dolby True HD, DTS Master Audio, Dolby 5.1, Mono, Stereo, etc. It does do this & when playing the movie in question it does display: "" DTS Master Audio."" But, no sound. I tried the Spanish & the French track & they play just fine but they are not DTS Master Audio. 2nd movie audio plays just fine & but it is  DTS Master Audio 5.1.

As two irrascible, but likeable geezers in these movies, these great comedic actors play off each other in the uniquely American type of deprecatory humor, while hiding great affection for each other.  Pitted against one another in the unlikely pursuit of lovely Ann Margret in the first, and the symetrical but equally unlikely matching of Matthau with beautiful Sofia Loren, sparks frequently fly, while the problems of advancing age loom in the background.  It's all handled beautifully by these two, with a little help from Burgess Meredith (Jack Lemon's horny Dad) and of course from the two lovely ladies in nicely complimentary roles.  Of course, the Blu-Ray format is outstanding.  This two movie set makes for a great way to spend a lazy afternoon.

the audio on the Grumpy title would only play in French and Spanish, not English.
The Grumpier title had no problem.
So I decided to search the web for any other comments about this. Ah, there was someone else out there. I do have a DTS receiver, but for whatever reason, and I am no rocket scientist, I had to reset my audio out feature on blu ray player to PCM? I don't know. Somehow I managed, and it worked. Since the Grumpy feature is only a 2.0 DTS. while the foreign language was Dolby Digital. Since the track was only 2.0 why did they have to make it DTS?

I was very excited to get this Blu Ray in the mail a few days ago! The transfers look awesome! Very clean, and sharp, and, at LAST, in 16x9 WIDESCREEN.

I do agree with the reviews that I've read, stating most people are kind of upset about being able to own BOTH films for the same price, or less than, the cost paid for Grumpy Old Men on Blu Ray. I too bought the Grumpy Old Men Blu Ray, back in December. I paid $17.99 here on Amazon for it. Then a few weeks later I saw the listing, thanks to High Def Digest ([...]) and was bummed to think I bought 1 film for 17.99, when the pre-list price for BOTH was 17.99! But oh well! I am just EXTREMELY happy to see both of these great films on Blu Ray!

Now I am hoping that FOX will release Out To Sea on Blu Ray! Walter and Jack were the greatest duo in the past 30 years, and are always a joy to watch!!!

Sure this disc is missing the trailers, and there are NO special features. But, if you like the movies, BUY this Blu Ray! You will NOT be disappointed!!!",1267315200,31,1179,4.008510638297873

The Blu-ray itself, for both films, look as good as they probably can and the audio (both sport DTS-HD Master Audio, with Grumpy has 2.0 channels and Grumpier has 5.1) for both are better than acceptable. Also, both films are on one disc but given there are no features, a 50GB Blu-ray disc easily handles them both.

If you're a fan like I am for both of these films, Warner has set a respectable SRP ($24.98 at the time of this writing) so it very well may reach the $10 mark in the not too distant future. For those who don't appreciate Warner doing this, I understand, but if you can get it on the cheap, then just think of it as getting this sequel and ignore the original (if you already own the stand alone Blu-ray).

Personally, I think it's worth it to get the widescreen transfer at long last...",1267228800,12,1081,4.533333333333333

Now...they release it again with the bonus of the sequel also on BLU-RAY!!  I don't understand why these companies wonder why sales are dropping? First its re-releasing DVDs with more features months after initial release then TV series complete releases making individual seasons expensive and lacking in bonus features and now reliable Warner Bros..(one of the normal good guys) burning all of us who paid more than this for the first film only.  Its like waiting for the other shoe to drop now when DVDs or Blu-Rays come out as to when the EXTRA, CHEAPER, BONUS LADEN, version will arrive to make fools of us who ran out and supported the initial release. If you waited...then you are rewarded and this would be a delightful double bill. I thought the movies had cross generational appeal and the talented stars were at peak performance.

2580519,5,B000FOPPC4,These films are perfect.  Especially if you are in this age bracket and are yourself married to a Grumpy Old Man.  My friend who has been ice fishing said that was a true example of what happens out on the ice.  For grumpy people in general it probably hits too close to home.  Great movies no matter the format.  They are both wonderful. The first a little less predictable than the second.  But the second's actors were wonderful in different ways.,1261180800,,450,4.493827160493828

2580532,1,B000FOPPC4,"The ""Grumpy Old Men"" movies are very funny and very well produced.  They were produced at a visual aspect of 1.85:1.  However, they have never been released on DVD at that ratio.  They have been slashed down to 1.33:1 ... the so-called ""full"" screen ratio.  ""Full"" screen is the rip-off industry's euphemism for ""mutilated"".  A truly FULL screen is the screen of the original production.

If you want to buy this butchered product and miss fully 30% of the original films, go ahead. Let me know if you do:  I have some nice riverside property in New Orleans I'd like you to consider buying.",1249948800,5,590,4.615384615384615

2580534,1,B000FOPPC4,"Ok, now I'm officially disgruntled.  This is the THIRD time these movies have been released on DVD.  This is also the THIRD time Warner couldn't see fit to release these in their original aspect ratio (a.k.a. WIDESCREEN).  This really is unbelievable.  My eyes lit up when I saw the listing with the new cover art and the words ""pre-order"".  So here I am thinking that maybe.....just maybe they finally got it right.  Third time's a charm, right?  WRONG!  You know with the first film, Warner saw fit to release the widescreen edition on Blu-Ray, and yet the DVD format gets three releases, and all of them ""modified to fit your TV"".  Shame on Warner for doing this to fans of the films.  It really is a huge disappointment.  As much as I LOVE these movies, and as much as I'd love to have them sit atop my DVD shelf, I refuse to purchase them in this manner.  To drop the ball 3 consecutive times on the same 2 movies is just uncalled for.",1248048000,11,940,4.369942196531792

I bought it as a gift for my sister in the UK since it's not available in region 2 format.

HOWEVER !

Please be aware that both movies are in 4:3 Full Screen format.

Why does the USA insist on damaging movies and releasing them in this format on DVD.

2580541,5,B000FOPPC4,"Two geezers arguing is funny as it is.  Two geezers taking that argument further and pulling immature pranks on each other is even funnier.  What makes it funniest is the great comedic duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are the two geezers behind those pranks.

That's what you get with ""Grumpy Old Men/Grumpier Old Men.""  In the first installment  the two old grumps compete for the attention of an attractive widow (Ann-Margret) who's just moved in across the street from them.  In the sequel, Matthau and Lemmon return, but this time to stop their beloved bait shop from being turned into a restaurant.  In translation, war between Maria (Sophia Lauren) and Max (Matthau) and John (Lemmon).

Together Matthau and Lemmon are comedy gold...Matthau with his charmingly sarcastic jokes and witty one-liners and Lemmon also with some witty one-liners, but he was always the more serious of the two, constantly trying to fix the messes that Matthau`s characters would create.  Their chemistry on screen was amazing and can never be duplicated.  This double feature is a must have for fans of Matthau and Lemmon.

Ignore the one star reviews...they just bash the fact that it's not widescreen claiming they were all schemed.  The back of the DVD clearly states that the movies are FULL screen.",1218326400,,1292,4.9581395348837205

You get Two movies on one two-sided DVD (2x1) at the price of a single coffee Latte at Starbucks, Pete's, Java or at your favorite spot.

WIDE-SCREEN vs. FULL-SCREEN format, hmm???, needless to say we might buy it on Blue-Ray in the near future, however if you can spear less than Ten Bucks for Two movies with Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon the best ever comedic duo, plus the supporting roles of both sultry royalty actresses Ann-Margret, and Sophia Loren, also in the cast are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, Both movies are very funny at least the first one is hilarious.

Have a few laughs and enjoy. Thanks.

2580556,5,B000FOPPC4,"ive been a fan of both these movies since i was a kid. im not sure why. it seems like you cant really relate or anything being young, but these were what made me think getting old might not be so bad. very funny, entertaining movies. the chemistry between these actors was great.

but my tv is full screen anyway, so i don't really care about everybody complaining about the lack of widescreen. besides, its written right on the back ""FULLSCREEN""... this is america, and i know how low the literacy rate is, but come on..

Grumpy old Men focuses on John Gustufson(lemmon) and Max Goldman(matthau) as they battle for the affection of the new neighbor Ariel(Ann Margret)

Grumpier focuses on the marriage of Max and Johns Children, along with the loneliness of Max, and the solution to said problem.

Lemmon and Matthau are probably the best comedy team of our time. both movies are classics and should be part of any comedy collection.",1203292800,2,934,4.676829268292683

Plus, I checked my old separate collections of each film, and they were also in fullscreen--nothing ventured, nothing gained!

Just kick back and enjoy the work of 2 masterful actors who have since left us; the lovely/saucy presence of Ann-Margret (and later, Sophia Loren); plus, the scene-stealing ""dirty old man"" Burgess Meredith.

I bought these films on VHS years ago but didn't buy the first dvd releases of them because they weren't in, you guessed it, widescreen. I can see how really big fans of them would be upset by that. It does seem funny to me because in the past Warner Bros. has rereleased films like ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Ace Ventura:Pet Detective"" in widescreen, the latter just last week. This rerelease of the ""Grumpy"" films looks to me like the original dvd releases put on one disk, as the menus and special features seem to indicate so.
