The military is trying to tell the media it is was a product of Nazi war propaganda from WW2, but Professor Quatermass thinks it  is from another planet. Some people who enter the craft claim they have  seen things and some are even controlled for brief periods.  Quatermass  theorizes that the craft and those that were aboard it had a hand in our  evolution and he also thinks the craft may be alive.  This film shows  how far a good script can take a film because this is certainly interesting  from beginning to end. A fine cast really does a good job, ecspially Keir  and Shelley. Some of the special effects are weak like the locust  creatures, but for the most part Hammer does a great job of making this  look more expensive than it was.  The craft, the excavation site, the  flying objects and the destruction at the conclusion all look good for the  time.

902983,5,6304632444,"Quatermass & The Pit is one of the finest sci-fi movies ever made, period.  Set in 1960s London, a tube station is being extended when bones and what might be an unexploded World War II bomb are found.  This is the  cue for some intense weirdness to start happening.
The screenplay does  not suffer for the changes for the movie from the original tv series some  12 years earlier, as it was done by writer Nigel Kneale himself.  Roy Ward  Baker's direction is spot on as well, giving Julian Glover, Barbara  Shelley, James Donald and particularly Andrew Keir as Quatermass room to  perform.
The DVD itself has a delightful second soundtrack taking the  form of a discussion between Kneale and Baker which sheds light on many  aspects of the filming, as well as theatre and tv trailers and the World Of  Hammer episode on science fiction.

903118,5,6304632444,"5 Stars because this odd, low budget, quirky little 1960s SF film from Hammer Studios (of Dracula 'B' pictures fame) has a definite and stubbornly enduring appeal.

Filmed in Britain as 'Quatermass And The Pit"" and featuring the English Professor Quatermass (a British TV series character that few outside Britain had heard of) it was wisely re-titled for its USA release as the more SF-sounding 'Five Million Miles To Earth'.

The low budget shows. The 1960s special effects are, well, 1960s Hammer Films level-- you expect to see plastic vampire teeth appear any second. The script and direction are uneven, and the film starts more slowly and awkwardly than any SF film I can think of--it takes forever to introduce our 4 main characters, all of whom are pretty much made of cardboard, with wooden delivery and a total lack of humor or comic relief.

Still, there's an interesting concept here, and even though it never really gets fully developed, it's interesting enough to keep this movie alive 45+ years later (and here I am writing a review for it in 2015).

Other reviewers have covered the (fairly simple) plot pretty completely. Suffice to say that excavations to expand a London Subway have unearthed what is first thought to be an unexploded WW2 German buzz bomb, but soon proves to be a long-buried alien spacecraft--5,000,000 years old, in fact.

Aboard the long-buried ship are some equally long-dead grasshopper-like aliens. It's never really clear how the ship is actually dated to 5M, or how the ship is traced to Mars, but for the remainder of the film these insects are referred to as 'The Martians'.
And apparently these grasshoppers decided to build a spaceship out of what appears to be 1960s race-car-body fiberglass and they came to Earth, somehow jumpstarting (or intentionally interfering with, it's never quite clear) early human evolution.
Well, okay. Interesting concept (this is well before Von Daniken and 'Chariots Of The Gods', who I always suspected got his multi-zillion-bestseller concept direct from this movie script)
After arriving, and somehow altering human evolution, they then died out. Yet their psychic energy is so superhumanly powerful that they manifest violent poltergeist disturbances, causing earthquakes in the subway, and finally possessing a mob of London passersby, including Quatermass himself. Finally the Martian-grasshopper-spaceship begins glowing, then fading out in that film-negative-reversal 1960s effect used for Star Trek's transporter beam, and disappears. To where? Piloted by whom? Back in time? Back to Mars? Off to another dimension?
We never get an explanation, and the characters never discuss even a speculation. The film raises some interesting questions, then runs out of time and the end credits roll.
It's an annoying Hammer Films thing, like those hasty trick endings in which an all-triumphant Dracula suddenly slips on a banana peel and opens the window curtains, suddenly disintegrating in daylight while the credits roll.

Still, the film raises some fun ideas that you can kick around afterwards, and I give it full credit for raising these ideas first (they are familiar mainstream concepts now, but only because this Quatermass film introduced them to us).

I wouldn't pay a lot to own this--it's not infinitely re-watchable, and the more times you view it, the more obvious the plot and continuity gaps become, and the more this feels like 'Hammer Films-copies-Dr. Who'-- but everyone should see it at least once, and it's perfect to see on Streaming or a rental.

As I stated above, this is a good movie remake, it's just that there is so much going on in the original six-part TV version that it's hard to fit everything into this 98-minute movie, and some of the good stuff in the TV version had to be left out of this theatrical version. Like, for one example, the underlined moral point of the story is lost in this version. I also think the TV version was scarier, more realistic, and was better directed. But this theatrical version is still worth getting mainly because it's still really suspenseful, it's got pretty good special effects in it considering it was made back in 1967; better special effects than in the TV version, and it also gets you through the story a lot quicker. And after all, it does got the same good story that the original had in it and it's written by the same person - the great Nigel Kneale. I also think Andrew Keir makes an excellent Quatermass. I've been a fan of Andrew Keir ever since I seen him in the Doctor Who film ""Daleks: Invasion Earth 2150 A.D."".

903338,2,6304632444,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  'Five Million Years to Earth' is the US title for the British film, 'Quartermass and the Pit'. It's based on a BBC six-part TV serial, broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. There were two prior TV series, The Quartermass Experiment (1953) and Quartermass II (1955), followed by two films of the same name released in 1955 and 1957 respectively. The original BBC TV Series can be seen on Youtube in 21 separate segments (however, the year of release, 1955, is confused with the year Quartermass II, the TV series, and The Quartermass Experiment, the film, were released).

  The advantage of the 1967 film over the 1958-59 TV serial, is that it's condensed, and the story moves along at a better, somewhat brisk pace. The main disadvantage of the 1967 film is that Quartermass is woodenly played by Andrew Keir, who hated acting in the film because he believed the director really wanted another actor (Kenneth More) to play the role. Keir plays Quartermass deadpan and bores us to tears. Contrast Keir's acting with Andre Morell in the original TV series. Morell reminds one of the wry Leo G. Carroll and one of the reasons why the TV series was so successful, was precisely due to Morrell's air of sophistication and dry wit.

  Despite moving at a faster pace in the film version, 'Five Million Years to Earth' is still nothing more than what one critic at the time called a ""wordy, blob of hokum"". It takes an inordinate amount of time before the big reveal, which is when the creatures are discovered. In the TV series, the insect-like creatures actually look pretty realistic--this is probably due to the fact that the TV series was filmed in black and white. Now in crisp, 60s color, these so-called 'arthopods', which resemble really big grasshoppers, appear as too obvious, papier-mach models. There's all quite a bit of overacting here: probably the most guilty is Duncan Lamont who plays Sladden, the drill operator. Once the repressed memories from the aliens are unleashed, Sladden makes his way to a cemetery, looking more like a goofy, drunken reveler at a party, than someone with severe psychiatric problems. When the masses are possessed at film's end, none of it feels realistic or scary. Contrast that again with the TV series, which manages to convey a heady verisimilitude. I should also mention that the music is vastly superior in the original series than the paltry, clichd, 60s score, written for the film.

  The characterizations of the principals also fail to draw one in. Colonel Breen is your basic military martinet, opposed by Quartermass, who represents the triumphant voice of pacifism. Breen is the one who comes up with the idiotic idea that the alien ship is basically a Nazi missile dressed up as a propaganda tool and the defense minister immediately announces that it's safe for the press to examine the spaceship inside the subway station. As it turns out, no one heeds the 'brilliant' Quartermass, who has warned everyone of the alien danger; it's only when Dr. Roney, Quartermass' paleontologist colleague/comrade at the site, crashes a crane into the alien spectral image, that the repressed memories of the crazed mob are 'shut off' at the scene, thus preventing mass havoc from becoming a garish reality, all over Britain.

  Julian Glover matches Anthony Bushell, who plays Breen in the TV series; both manage to convey the character's lack of flexibility and unbending attitude as an authority figure. It should be noted that the scenarist, Nigel Kneale, who wrote the original script, has Breen basically hypnotized by the aliens before being done in by them. Kneale is suggesting here that authoritarian types are inherently passive and paints Breen as one who too easily acquiesces to voices in authority during a time of crisis.

  In the BBC series, Dr. Roney is played by a rather blas, Cec Linder, a Canadian actor; James Donald, who reminds me of a little like Michael York, seems more right for the part in the film, as he has more of an aura of sophistication than Linder. The more plain-looking Christine Finn as Barbara Judd in the original TV series, seems to work better than Barbara Shelley in the film, as there's more of a contrast when the Judd character suddenly becomes possessed.

  For all those film goers who view 'Five Million Years to Earth', as a cult classic, I can only once again recommend that you watch some of the original BBC TV series on Youtube. It's a shame that the 1967 film wasn't shot in black and white, as the film needed much more of a documentary feel to it (which was accomplished in the TV series). It's surprising that Roy Ward Baker, the director of the most excellent, 'A Night to Remember', the 1958 film about the Titanic, was unable to successfully handle the special effects here in 'Five Million Years to Earth'. Had he been successful, it still wouldn't have mattered that much--'Five Million Years to Earth', is still a film that surprisingly lacks (in the words of a film critic writing at the time the film was released), ""imagination,""",1320710400,3,5094,4.8523644752018456

903345,5,6304632444,"Once upon a time, during the 1950s, three popular science-fiction serials aired on BBC TV, all featuring that thinking man's hero, Professor Bernard Quatermass. Hammer Films grabbed these serials and turned them into feature films. FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH, also known as QUARTERMASS AND THE PIT, is the final entry and it happens to be the best of the trilogy (the other two are THE CREEPING UNKNOWN a.k.a. THE QUARTERMASS XPERIMENT and ENEMY FROM SPACE a.k.a. QUARTERMASS 2). FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH flourishes on an intelligent script (all three films do), but it is the bleakest entry, and it introduces a most foreboding conceit. It supposes that the darkest aspects of the human condition are unchangeable and irreversible and, what's more, are traits for which man had been purposely bred on a genetic scale by a fiendish extraterrestrial species. That'll sit you back pensively in your chair.

Seeking to extend the London Underground, workers dig into Hobbs End, a neighborhood historically notorious for weird happenings, and an ancient alien space ship is unearthed. Curiosity is a two-edged sword, as we learn again when scientists and military factions descend on Hobbs End. The cautionary story spins off from that. Appropriately, because this is a Hammer Films produced project, the story is also tinged with a strong horror element. The tone is consistently foreboding, and the escalation to horror is gradual but it builds and builds. Hammer's lovely leading scream queen Barbara Shelley submits a very credible performance (and she doesn't even scream in this one). Andrew Keir as Prof. Quatermass is an improvement on Brian Donlevy who was lamentably a bit too strident and, worse, American. Keir's take is more understated and his scientist more humane.

This movie echoes plenty of that sense of paranoia, mirrors the irrational fears, harbored by a global population during the Cold War. Although not quite in the same timeless mold, FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH holds up pretty well against other cautionary sci-fi classics (THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS). The cold illumination of science strives to cast out the shadows of long held superstitions, but what the hell do you do when scientific findings instead uphold those superstitions? In this movie, a hostile alien race dead these millions of years may not be as dead as first supposed. And we are their children, cursed with a race memory of violence and malevolence.

Maybe I'm poking too deep, but there seems to be a whiff of a theme of the British government as a totalitarian regime. Professor Quatermass and his allies attempt to warn the public but struggle against the unshaking obtuseness and obfuscation of the Ministry of Defense, which seeks to control or spin the staggering unfolding events its own way. Nothing wrong here, nothing to see. Just move on, chaps. This costs London dearly, as we watch the film's chilling final twenty minutes. The closing credits roll over a scene empty of dialogue. Quatermass and Barbara Shelley's heroine wearily slump across from each other, amidst London's rubble, unable to look each other in the eye, well cognizant of what they've done, of how close they've gotten to that abyss. There's no escaping the alien race's insidious influence. The human race may be well and truly bollocksed.",1278720000,,3389,5.091726618705036
903346,5,6304632444,"Do you want to *not* pay ridiculous scalper's prices for this timeless and expensive film [DVD]? Turner Classic Movies runs this one occasionally under its American title (according to Ben Mankiewicz who hosts on TCM and, affirmed by IMDB online) ""Five Million Years to Earth"" and *you* know what to do about that in this age of DVR and DVD recorder technology! I hope that helps you out.

*The Story*

While renovating a closed London underground station, city workers uncover an ancient spaceship, (a contention that is of course debated by a noxious British Army officer who wants to whitewash the discovery by calling it a WW II German propaganda weapon, designed to cause a general panic.) But Professor Quatermass [rockets are his thing] isn't going to stand for any of *that* nonsense and he and a renowned anthropologist search for the truth.

What they discover is that the site has long been associated with very spiritually evil happenings. Then the two scientists find that the power of the ship's former occupants (giant grasshoppers from Mars) has been awakened through the unfortunate excavation. Soon thereafter, chaos in the form of an invisible devilish entity threatens to decimate London (and beyond) through mind control of humans and it's up to the two professors to quash this nefarious space demon!

I realize that this sounds like a really stupid film but it's not -- that's because it's a Hammer Film Production (1968) and it's a top-notch movie. This is the third (final period entry) of the so-called ""Professor Quatermass films"", shot in color, running for about 98 minutes, and presented in letterbox format.

In summary, if you're either a classic science fiction or horror film fan then you've hit the jackpot here. Well-done and mega-Kudos to Hammer Films for yet another great old scary movie.

Highly recommended.",1278720000,4,1848,5.0426229508196725
903347,5,6304632444,"After a decade long absence from the silver screen, Hammer released Quatermass And The Pit in 1967. Adapted by Nigel Kneale from his own TV serial that aired in 1958 and early 1959 on the BBC, the film version would prove to be as much as fitting conclusion to the Hammer Quatermass films as it TV counterpart was for the BBC serials. For like the TV version it remains not only the best of best of the three initial Quatermass stories but also one of the most imaginative and brilliantly crafted pieces of science fiction to ever be put on a screen either big or small.

The film features a fine cast of actors. Playing Professor Bernard Quatermass is Andrew Keir, replacing Brian Donlevy from the first two Hammer Quatermass films (and the fifth actor to play the role if you include the three BBC serials). Keir, alongside actor Andr Morell as Quatermass in the TV version of Pit, gives what might very well be the definitive Quatermass. From the moment Keir appears he takes on the role and makes it his own. He does this by being convincing as both scientist and as a man frightened by what he discovers in the pit and beyond. He is man who discovers a horrifying truth and struggles to convince his bureaucratic bosses of it before an even greater horror is unleashed yet retains a sense of authority at the same time, not an easy thing to do but Keir pulls it off brilliantly. Even more important, Keir's performance makes the whole film all the better for it.

Joining Keir is a fine supporting cast. James Donald is Dr. Matthew Roney, the anthropologist who is fascinated by his discoveries and willing to face the consequences of them no matter the cost. Julian Glover is Colonel Breen, a military man forced upon Quatermass' British Rocket Group who takes Quatermass into the pit and, as a man almost primitive in his thinking to the point of ignoring the facts, becomes most responsible for the films ending. There's others as well ranging from Bryan Marshall as the leader of the bomb disposal squad to Barbara Shelley as Roney's assistant to Duncan Lamont (who incidentally appeared in a pivotal role in the BBC version of first Quatermass serial, The Quatermass Experiment) as Sladden and Edwin Richfield as the Minister of Defense as well. The supporting cast, in roles big and small, give fine performances while anchoring the film firmly in reality.

With with its fine cast, it is as much the aspects of the serial behind the camera that make Quatermass And The Pit as imaginative and brilliantly crafted as it is. The sets stand out from the Underground (subway here in the States) station where the pit is located to Roney's lab and the halls of the Ministry of Defense. The score by composer Tristram Cary, in both its orchestral and electronic pieces, helps give the film a strong sense of both atmosphere and tension, especially in the lead up to its finale. The special effects are well done as well ranging from the effective insect like Martians to the various effects seen in the finale. While some of the effects might not be up to the standards of present day CGI, they remain effective nonetheless.

Then there is the script of course. Though it took nearly a decade before it could be brought to the big screen, writer Nigel Kneale superbly adapts his classic serial into a fine piece of science fiction film. The film, released a year before Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke brought it to the mainstream in 2001: A Space Odessy, asks the fascinating (and to some terrifying) question ""what if what makes us human isn't human at all?"" and terrifyingly answers it in a way that turns 2001's ideas standing on their heads. Kneale looks at human nature and in particular racism and the occult in a science fiction context and shows us the consequences of racism in a way that is too realistic to be ignored. Though free from the limitations of live TV and only about half the length of the TV version, Kneale's script is full of fine dialogue and debates on everything from the nature of racism to the military takeover of otherwise peaceful scientific research. In particular there is one scene set at the Ministry where Quatermass is called to explain what has been found in the pit, that stands out as amongst the best pieces of science fiction writing ever. If there is a fault with the script it is that it ends the film at a rather odd point when compared to the TV version and misses out on using a fine piece of Kneale's original script in the process. Overall though Kneale adapts his scripts superbly and gives this remake a life of its own.

In short Quatermass And The Pit is not only the best of the Hammer Quatermass films but may well be the finest film Hammer ever produced. This is thanks to the films fine performances, good effects, fine music and a brilliant script. While perhaps too dialogue heavy for some, Quatermass And The Pit is proof that you don't necessarily need a huge budget to create a fine science fiction film. Quatermass couldn't have ended at Hammer any better.",1275436800,3,5032,4.63677130044843
903447,5,6304632444,"By the time this film was released in America as FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH in 1968, I was a confirmed fan of Hammer Films and tried to see as many of their movies as I could. Somehow I missed this one in the theaters and at the drive-ins so I had to wait 10 years before I caught up with it on television. It quickly became one of my favorite Hammer offerings thanks to a fascinating script by Nigel Kneale, great performances from an ensemble cast and tight, no-nonsense direction from Roy Ward Baker. QUATERMASS AND THE PIT is Hammer Sci-Fi's finest hour.

The story centers around the finding of a large buried object in the London Underground and the issues and implications that arise from its discovery. Physics professor Bernard Quatermass (the main character of a series of BBC television shows and two previous films) and his colleagues believe the object to be extraterrestrial, the military and the authorities do not. By the time the truth is discovered and fully realized after a series of disturbing incidents, all hell breaks loose (literally) in a way that no one could imagine. The ending is a real stunner.

This is a classic example of intelligent sci-fi that mixes evolution, politics and the origins of spiritual evil. The implications raised by the script are absolutely fascinating and clever beyond words. That's what keeps me coming back to this film when I get tired of today's multi-million dollar technical extravaganzas. The film is a major miracle on a minor budget. Unfortunately the Region 1 DVD is out of print and very expensive. Try renting or downloading it or if you have the proper player get an affordable Region 2 copy.

903451,5,6304632444,"""Quatermass and the Pit"" is the most exciting science fiction/horror hybrid I've seen from Hammer Productions.  The plot is intricate, exciting and thought provoking; it offers extremely unique theories of man's origin on earth.

  Professor Quatermass (Andrew Keir of ""Dracula:  Prince of Darkness"") is investigating what first appears to be an unexploded bomb found during the construction of a subway line.  Upon further examination, he learns that it is an alien spacecraft that is over five million years old.  The identity of its crewmembers is quite disturbing.  Worse of all, the spacecraft appears to have a life of its own.  Pandemonium breaks out in London as the spacecraft takes possession of men's bodies and souls, turning them into killing machines that can't be stopped.

  ""Quatermass and the Pit"" is a must have for everyone who owns a collection of science fiction and/or Hammer Production classics.  I could not afford to purchase the one from Anchor Bay; instead I bought the one released by Optimum Classic, which is NTSC Region 1, from Britain.  The audio and video are great.

However, I wouldn't recommend it to those who don't appreciate what classic sci-fi is all about. The story is intriguing and it unfolds in very well-crafted manner. The acting is sometimes a bit overdone but blends in with the overall urgency of the plot. Lots of loose ends are not explained but enough are to be satisfactory and even with the limited special effects, there's and eeriness about the music and the alien design work that is still quite effective. If the original series fill in more of the details (or maybe a book version?) it would probably rate as a top notch sci-fi piece.

903454,5,6304632444,"""Quatermass and the Pit"" is a 1967 Hammer procuction and was released in the USA as ""Five Million Years to Earth,"" which is a better title in my opinion.

THE STORY: Digging constuction workers in London discover neanderthal-like skeletons and a large object initially thought to be a WWII missile. Col. Breen (Julian Glover) and Prof. Quatermass (Andrew Keir) are put in charge of the operation and draw completely different conclusions about the discovery: Breen ludicrously believes it's a German propaganda weapon from WWII, whereas Quartermass concludes that it's a martian spacecraft that incredibly explains the origins of the human species (!), not to mention so-called myths about the devil, demons, gargoyles and various other occultic items. Unearthing the object turns out to be a big mistake because it lets loose a malevolent supernatural force that starts to possess the populace.

I remember seeing ""Five Million Years to Earth"" a handful of times growing up and I never failed to be enthralled by the creepy and thought-provoking events of the story. Viewing it recently, I was interested to see how well it would hold up in the new mellennium and if it could still inspire and maintain my fascination now that I'm an adult. Well, it holds up quite well, and I still found it thought-provoking, spooky and fairly fascinating. Yes, the clothing is decidedly dated, and naturally so, but that adds to the charm. Some complain about the dated ""special effects"" but -- c'mon -- this was made in the mid-60s! I feel the F/X hold up quite well and don't detract from the story at all. Hey, at least they're better than the F/X of the original Star Trek TV Series. The spaceship, the Martian carcasses, the numerous floating objects and the eerie Satanic image at the end all work fine as far as I'm concerned. Besides, it's the story that counts and this is Sci-Fi of the highest order.

One highlight is the beautiful Barbara Shelley, who assists in the operation; she was 34 at the time. If there's an American remake, I'm sure her part will be played by a 22 year-old skinny blond with oversized breasts. Shelley incidentally appeared in a few other Hammer flicks, like ""Rasputin, the Mad Monk"" and ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness.""

The climax is quite apocalyptic [SPOILER ALERT!]. I love the final shot of Quatermass and Barbara, still in shock, recovering from the events and just thankful to be alive; then the credits start rolling, accompanied by a beautiful melancholic musical piece. A potent ending to a stellar 60's Sci-fi masterpiece.",1206489600,4,2557,4.93953488372093
903455,4,6304632444,"I hadn't seen this for a very long time, so to watch it again on a big widescreen TV was a real treat. This is a film that has aged well. Its forty years old now, yet somehow the special effects still seem reasonable. In fact at the end I was quite surprised at just how good the effects still looked.

Andrew Keir does a fine job portraying Quatermass. Keir was a Hammer regular and appeared in many British TV series over the years. His Quatermass is immensley frustrated by the military, who he has to work with most of the time. He and Col Breen (Julian Glover) really loath each other and never miss an opportunity to try and humilate each other. I was slightly less convinced by James Donald's performance as Dr Roney, he was just a little bit stilted.

The story and screenplay by Nigel Kneale is intelligent Sci-fi, which although out-dated now, at least has a plausible side to it. Go back ten or more years earlier and watch a film like ""When Worlds Collide"" (which is a very good Sci-fi film btw) to see just how silly Sci-fi can get once science catches up. Whilst excavating in a London underground station the workman come across some old skulls and what initially is thought to be an unexploded 2nd world war bomb. This of course is far from the truth...

I won't bother you with the plotline - Amazon does an adequate job of that.

903539,5,6304632444,"One of Hammer Films finest moments, produced at the prestigious MGM British Studios it contains intelligent direction, a great script, and most importantly first rate performances from the actors, the one genre of movie the success of which is highly dependant on the believability of the acting is that of science fiction, if one is anything but completely convinced you have a comedy, these days the load is carried to a large extent by sophisticated special effects but nothing is as satisfying as to be totally engrossed due to the integrity of fine actors who can give a film true realism, what we have with this version of Quatermass and the Pit is just that, the entire cast give 100% including and most importantly the actors playing the small roles.

 Andrew Keir is quite brilliant in the lead roll of Bernard Quatermass; James Donald always full of subtleties gives his usual insightful performance as anthropologist Dr Roney, Barbara Shelley is superb in a particularly demanding role as is Duncan Lamont, The direction by Roy Ward Baker is well thought out and economically creative, there is one scene where the camera is tracking as an actor exits the ""pit"" and then ""catches "" the entrance of another cast member as he comes into the frame and tracks back to the original point. Most directors would have just made a cut at this juncture but Baker's incisive and thoughtful preparation allows the action to flow without editing and helps with the kinetics of the film.

Without giving too much away of the plot what is thought to be an unexploded bomb is found by workmen digging a new extension on London's underground train network, for at least twenty years after WW11 unexploded bombs were being discovered on a fairly regular basis in London where a considerable amount of rebuilding was taking place.

It is in the investigation of just what it is that is buried that the movie unfolds, This is a very thought provoking film on several levels and it's creator Nigel Kneale covers a lot of ground during the one hour and thirty eight minutes of the films duration, why we are here, where do we come from, the conflict between myopic government bureaucracy and scientists, supernatural goings on and army belligerence, casting is superb and all the characters are well developed, in addition Tristram Cary's score is also a highly affective ingredient.

The DVD transfer is good and there is an informative commentary with director Roy Ward Baker and writer Nigel Kneale.

Being made in 1967 special effects rely mostly on ingenuity but current technology is not particularly missed save for the only disappointing moment in the film where a brief view of creatures on another planet is unconvincing, it's difficult to imagine the circumstances by which this clip was thought to be convincing and acceptable.

I cannot recommend Quatermass and the Pit highly enough, an edge of your seat treat and one of the most impressive of sci-fi movies eclipsed only by the next film to be made at MGM British Studios ""2001 A Space Odyssey""",1140739200,5,3049,4.874517374517374
903540,5,6304632444,"Quatermass and the Pit is a genuinely great screenplay, one of the smartest sci-fi films ever written because it deals with interesting ideas rather than stock effects. There are a few of them, some good, some bad, and the budget isn't always enough for the ambition, but the ideas are what carry this one - tying in colonisation, evolution, race memories, the Devil, hauntings and other theories alongside military and government closed-mindedness into a cohesive intelligent whole by not going for the sensational but sitting to down to think, ""Now where could that belief in so many people have really come from?"" The conclusions may be outlandish, but the logic is rational and the treatment straightfaced, and once it builds up its head of steam, it's not just compelling but also a little bit worrying - particularly when civilisation starts to break down in an extremely violent way. Andrew Keir and James Donald are excellent and Barbara Shelley manages to be a convincing strong female lead in a genre that doesn't usually allow them and also to look really good in red jumper and Wellie boots! Powerful stuff and highly recommended - there really is a lot going on here, and it has a strong story sense to back it up. Just remember: ""We're the Martians now!""

This Anchor Bay DVD version is the one to go for - unlike the vanilla R2 version, this has commentary and trailers. Worth every penny!",1120262400,3,1404,4.801652892561983
903541,3,6304632444,"I should say right off this is one of my guilty pleasures, but it seems a little balance would useful in the reviews.  There are many good things about it, the plot is imaginative and I like some of the acting.  But the logic and the production fail in so many ways that anyone but a fan is likely to view it as a camp humor flick rather than a serious sci-fi movie.

For a sci-fi picture to work the science must at least be plausible, and there are just too many problems, starting with Breen asserting that the first one to build bases on the moon and Mars will be able ""to police the earth with nuclear weapons"".  I trust I don't need to point out how comical that is, and shame on the producers for assuming the audience would be so thick.  After that howler it's difficult to take it seriously, like the brain vision equipment, presented as if it were an everyday thing; oh, we just hook this up to that, and zang!  Brain movies.  Yeah, right.  And why would the Martians decompose so fast, even assuming they would have stayed juicy for 5 million years?  Silly.

Then there's the logic lapses.  The explanation by the overly-rigid and formalistic Breen is that the spacecraft must have been a German propaganda weapon.  This is spite of the material being harder than diamonds, incredibly resistant to heat (even Quatermass seems to miss the fact that it absorbs heat, which should have been a warning), the intact buildings overhead, the unlikelyhood of something buried that deep ever being found (how did it get there??) and so forth.  Sure, a by-the-book military type as a foil to Quatermass makes good sense, but Breen would have to be a barnyard idiot.

Finally the production values are very cheesy.  The clay they are digging is obviously in a stage set, you can see where the roof beams end next to the stage wall.  The exposition is sometimes very ham-handed (like a ""bomb squad"" billboard attached to the hood of a jeep), the news stories horribly corny (""New Finds!"").  Stuff like that makes you wince.

Well, at least this DVD is welcome to those who have a soft spot for this thing, like me.  And at least it puts the film together correctly.  For years and years it ran on local US television with the sequences completely out of order, and apparently no one running the film even noticed!

903542,5,6304632444,"Here's proof that quality science-fiction isn't about bloated budgets or state-of-the-art special effects -- it's about ideas, presented in an intelligent & gripping fashion. Nigel Kneale's work has always had the power to tap into the depths of the Unconscious, and never to greater effect than in this fine film. Simply as suspense & intellectual adventure, it's compelling; but as metaphor examining the dark places of the human psyche, it's absolutely stunning.

Kneale states in no uncertain terms that humanity is driven by primal, nearly forgotten forces which can spring to terrifying life at the proper impetus. No accident that the alien ship & the bones of our enslaved ancestors are discovered underground! And once those primal forces are activated, the veneer of rational, civilized life is stripped away, leaving a naked psyche driven by overwhelming, demonic instinct. The scene of a mob psychically attacking & killing a perceived ""outsider,"" who just moments before was just another neighbor, has been repeated throughout history. And given the current state of the world, it's likely to be repeated again.

It's notable that courage alone isn't enough to shut down this latest eruption of the irrational. Quatermass & Roney must use their minds, their reason, to face the monstrous threat, rather than surrendering to fear & superstition. It's not enough to label the threat as ""evil,"" which merely gives it a greater hold on the terrified mind; it must be faced & *understood* if it's to be countered.

So, ignore any complaints about poor or insufficient special effects. Those who can't see beyond the surface will never grasp the depths of this superb film anyway. But if you're ready for a thoughtful story, one which will leave you wondering about quite a few questions afterwards, then you've come to the right place.

Although critics appear on the whole to regard the Morell film as the definitive version, this 1968 retelling is an impressive effort.

 I sympathize with David Pirie, who criticized Roy Ward Baker for the ""limitless number of close-ups in an attempt to convey tension"". Certainly the close-ups are a little overdone, and Tristram Cary's otherwise brilliant score is a little too obvious too early on, yet still Quatermass and the Pit is a gripping, tense thriller with considerable suspense and atmosphere.

903646,5,6304632444,"Quatermass and the Pit (1968) is the third in the Quatermass series, beginning with The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), and followed by Quatermass 2 (1957), all written by Nigel Kneale, and is certainly one of the better Hammer Studios releases.  (That's a whole lot of Quatermass...)
The film starts out with an interesting find during the renovation of an underground subway station in the English town of Hobb's End.  Seems the workers found some ancient skeletal remains, early primate man it appears, prompting the work to stop, allowing for Dr. Mathew Roney (James Donald), his assistant Barbara Judd (Barbara Shelley, yowsa, yowsa) and a group of anthropologists to catalogue this remarkable discovery.  The situation soon turns from fantastic to frightening, as part of a large, metal object is uncovered, leading some to believe it may be an unexploded German bomb from the last world war.  Professor Bernard Quatermass (Andrew Kier), a physicist and rocket scientist, along with Colonel Breen (Julian Glover, who later appeared in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) and the military soon arrive to deal with the situation, but further digging reveals the large object not to be a remnant of a past war.  Turns out, it's not even an object of this Earth, as various attempts to penetrate the hull prove fruitless, as the object is of a material not recognizable to anyone.  Not only that, but a secret compartment reveals child-sized inhabitants of a bug-like nature.  As the scientists, the military, and the government grapple with this incredible find and all its' possible implications, the dissention amongst the parties involved begins, as not only of the origin of the object, and how best to disseminate information to the questioning public.
After Barbara, with the flaming red hair and beckoning green eyes (sorry...I got a little carried away) uncovers information about past odd happenings in the Hobb's End area, Professor Quatermass develops some interesting theories about the possibility of alien intervention in human development and reasons why.  This opens a whole new can of worms, and to say Colonel Breen and various high-ranking government officials were less than receptive to these theories is putting it lightly.  There position, akin to an ostrich putting its' head in the sand, is that the object and anything within was all a part of some German propaganda during the past war, designed to sow confusion and fear.  This turns out not to be true, as everyone learns later.  More scientific investigation reveals some truly interesting, and somewhat terrifying details.  In the end, the terror becomes a reality, and the stuff really hits the fan as the object turns out to be much more than anyone had expected or could have conceived.
To me, this is an excellent example of a true science fiction film.  The story is thick with rich, creamy flavor as elements are revealed, tying in not only with the present, but also the past.  The conclusion to the story is satisfying, but one is left with any number of questions that may never be answered, due to the plot intricacies developed through the film.  I really liked the portrayal of the powers that be in that they weren't trying to cover up some big secret, but just unwilling to face certain facts for fear that this information would have repercussions beyond the imagination, and most would probably not be able to even begin to wrap their minds around the possibilities presented with the alien object.  There is a real depth to this movie, one that keeps drawing you deeper and deeper, heaping implications on top of implications, giving this viewer the sense that his mind was actually being blown.  The whole affair was very intelligent and well put together, leading up to a very exciting climax.  I would recommend this to any fan of true science fiction, as it exemplifies what can be achieved when all the pieces come together.  This would certainly be the career highlight of capable director Roy Ward Baker, who also directed such films as Scars of Dracula (1970), Asylum (1972), And Now the Screaming Starts (1973), and The Monster Club (1980).  James Donald (Dr. Mathew Roney) also appeared prominently the classic WWII film The Great Escape (1963).  Andrew Kier (Prof. Quatermass) appeared in other Hammer films like Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966), along with costar Barbara Shelley, and also the less than stellar The Viking Queen (1967).
The wide screen print on the disc looks very good, with only very minor signs of wear in a couple of places, and special features, which are on the flipside of the disc, include US and UK theatrical trailers, TV spots, a feature length commentary track by director Roy Ward Baker and writer Nigel Kneale, and a World of Hammer episode entitled `Sci-Fi'.  If you're in the mood for an intelligent and highly entertaining science fiction film, you won't be disappointed in Quatermass and the Pit.

I bought the movie on the strength of that feeling and it didn't disappoint me to see it again as an adult.
Although I bought all three movies, this is my favourite Quatermass movie because the acting is so much better than the first two films.
Andrew Keir is the best and most sympathetic Quatermass in my opinion and the supporting cast, particularly James Donald (the real hero) and Barbara Shelley help raise the overall quality of the film.
Credit must also go to the author Nigel Kneale who has some terrific ideas and a real feel for science fiction. He also researches his subject well so his stories generally contain 'believable' science( the odd plant man not withstanding).
The way he weaves the old tales of goblins and devil folklore into the story is impressive and original, making the sudden discovery of these creatures less far-fetched  and ultimately quite courageous for it's time, considering the heresy at the heart of the story, that we owe our existence and evolution to clever insectoid martians!
The special effects are good considering the lack of technology available at the time and the story kicks along at a cracking pace. Be warned though, you may well be repeating lines in the pub like  ....they were leaping and jumping!!! for days afterwards with a bug-eyed expression on your face.
Or is that just me? (I'll get my coat.........)
I would say you if you like science fiction films you won't feel let down if you buy this movie. It's a movie worthy of the title 'classic'and I think stands up pretty well against today's efforts.",1079481600,8,1696,4.65
903648,5,6304632444,"Workers in a London underground railway station unearth humanoid skeletons---setting off excitement among the scientific and anthropological experts. But then a stranger object is found and the military gets involved, believing it to be a bomb. It turns out to be a spacecraft. Col. Breen (Julian Glover) explains it all away as a German craft left over from WWII. Dr. Roney (James Donald) and his assistant Barbara Judd (Barbara Shelley) are skeptical due to the skeletons but the estimable physicist Prof. Quatermass (Andrew Keir) thinks there's a more otherworldly explanation. There are legends and superstitions around the railway station area of hauntings and ""goblins"" that are too well documented to be ignored. Then strange vibrations begin to eminate from the spacecraft and the remains of the hideous crew are discovered. Breen and his superiors go into complete denial of extraterrestrial visitation while Roney, Barbara and Quatermass bond together to explore things further. And the results are horrifying. Superior Martian lifeforms that resemble giant locusts came to earth in these ships and took back with them ape-like early human beings to mutate with in an attempt to cleanse their own race...then returned with them to earth to repopulate on our planet as Mars was no longer capable of supporting life. Thus, we are descended from this unspeakable union! What's more, this arthropodic race of Martians were evil---capable of creating such powerful telekinetic energy that could create havoc and destroy as well as control the minds of lesser beings. When the ship vibrates to life, sending telekinetic energy every which way, all hell breaks loose. This is an incredible, intelligent sci-fi/horror story with a matchless cast delivering expert performances. A truly superior Hammer film. Excellent color, claustrophobic atmosphere and modest but remarkable special effects with top-notch direction from Roy Ward Baker make this a collector's item for any sci-fi/horror/Hammer fan. Excellent DVD treatment from Anchor Bay as well. Highly recommended all around.",1059868800,8,2082,5.509375
903649,4,6304632444,"Workers in London excavating a tunnel for a new ""Underground"" station, unearth more than...earth in the few first minutes of this Brit classic c. 1968.  Preparing to open a station at the ominously named ""Hobbs End"", they find bones of a long dead somebody that either resembled a very short ugly ape, or an uglier old man.  Nearby, they find an object - a bigger one.  Harder than diamond, as large as a small truck, yet non-magnetic, it immediately sparks the interest of Bernard Quatermass.
Who?
I confess, I never heard of Quatermass before catching this flick on the late-night movie (the idea of late-night movies is itself a fossil of an older, doomed and otherworldly civilization).  Even if you've never heard of Quatermass, you're still likely to find this an unimaginably creepy flick, the inspiration for at least several John Carpenter movies, and an incredible chiller.  As scientists ""reconstruct"" the skeleton and excavate the ""object"", the authorities dream up a reasonable explanation for both, which (coming from the government) won't fool you for a moment.  (The object is an unexploded Nazi ""V-weapon"", they say; besides being unexciting, the answer fails to explain how the Nazis synthesized a non-ferrous substance that can stand up to a diamond-tipped drill, and doesn't begin to explain how an object that big came down without disturbing any of the houses on top - buildings that look far older than the war).  Quatermass isn't so sure, but he pieces together the clues in a way that not only gives both the object and the dwarf an exotic origin, but one that bodes ill for both the roots and end of mankind.  Quatermass believes the object a spacecraft from Mars, an artifact of a now dead species that created life on various planets before dying out - invasion by proxy.  Though far advanced from us, the Martians are hardly benevolent - hinted by the fact that the human race may be the longest-living legacy to their evil.  Consumed by an impulse towards race war, the Martians killed themselves off in conflicts meant to resemble the Munich parades of the late 1930s (the idea of the ship being a Nazi weapon seems apt, metaphorically speaking).  Now free of its tomb, the Martian ship exerts anew its influence on the human race, one that both feeds off our fears and hatred of others, and empowers it.
""Five"" is a classic flick - a relentless chiller that never actually shocks you.  Still, there are some bits you wish the script was less subtle about - like near the end when it's unclear that normal Londoners are becoming aliens, empowered and yet enslaved by the ghost of an intelligence that's been dead for millions of years.  Also, you wish the script gave Quatermass a bit more to on when it allowed him to conclude that the ship was built by a technologically advanced yet racially minded (and therefore evil) species of Martians.  Bravely, the flick offers decidedly non-divine explanation for the creation of man that nevertheless embraces the existence of good and evil.  If you're looking for a conventional sci-fi epic in which the alien invaders are foiled in the end, look somewhere else.  This is definitely a thinking sci-fi epic.",1059264000,3,3183,4.855822550831793

I will simply say that this movie seems to be a pivotal piece between the at times Rank B style Scifi movies of the 50's and a next step up to some more thoughtful and well thought out story and special effects.  It left me breathless at moments the first time I saw it.  I tend to be one of those guys who covers my eyes like a big kid at the scary parts.  And this one had me covered several times over.  Anyway, this is worth the money because it is very simply one of the best runs for our money that came along in a long time.  It was released initially titled 3 or 5 million years to Earth which was quite disturbing when I went to look for that title.

903652,4,6304632444,"Quatermass and the Pit (aka Five Million Years to Earth to those of us in the US)is a stunning science fiction film from Hammer. Produced during a period when Hammer films had begun to look cheap, Pit has a number of stunning performances and well designed action sequences. Although the optical effects haven't aged all too well (the sequence where we ""see"" the Martians during their eugenics war looks about as convincing as the Zanti Misfits in the Outer Limits), the acting and imaginative sets save the day. I do have to praise the opticals at the close of the film as they still look stunning and are quite imaginative.
The plot is essentialy this; Martians left their planet and cultivated humanoids to be their slaves. They helped us along the evolutionary path. They also instilled something of their Martian mentality in us as well. When a spacecraft is discovered during a routine excavation for a new subway route, all hell breaks lose quite literally. A scientist named Quatermass (the delightful Andrew Keir) is called in to assist the military. The ship is actived and goes into something of a defense mode. It manipulates the humans turning them into Martians by somehow accessing a primal instinct programmed into humanity by the Martians.
There's a great deal of discussion about the myth of the Devil, religion and how the Martians figure into it. The script is sharp, literate and interesting. Roy Ward Baker's direction is tight and controlled creating suspense throughout the film. Anchor & Bay have done a great job with the transfer and included audio commentary from the writer and director.
I can't compare this to the television version produced for the BBC as I've never seen it but can't imagine a 6 hour version of this being anything but talky and less than suspenseful.",1035504000,,1801,4.888888888888889
903653,5,6304632444,"This was the first of 7 films that Roy Ward Baker directed for Hammer. I also feel that it was possibly Hammer's finest moment. I have seen this movie at least 5 times and I still love it. This is a remake of a British television series entitled Quatermass and the Pit. The same writer was used on the film and much of the same dialogue is used. And maybe Hammer has some other moments as equally fine as this, but this is such a good movie.
While digging a new subway tunnel underneath London, a large, metallic object is discovered. Different experts are brought in and the official story from the military is that it is an experimental type of bomb from from the Germans from WW II that didn't work. Others aren't so sure, including Professor Quatermass (Andrew Keir).
A little bit of detective work by Professor Quatermass and his assistant Barbara Judd (Barbara Shelley) turns up that the area of London that the object was discovered at, Hobbs Lane, has had a history of strange phenomena going back centuries. In fact the name Hobbs as it turns out, is actually a medieval name for the Devil.
Quatermass proposes that the object is an alien craft that has been buried for centuries, if not millennia, despite the military's insistence that it is a German dud. And soon after the discovery of the object, workers start dying or start having psychotic episodes with visions of seeing aliens that look like insects (kind of like a cross between a praying mantis and a grasshopper actually). The military is trying every tool they can to drill into the object, but to no effect. A cover finally opens up and all hell starts breaking loose around Hobbs Lane. Winds are blowing and people are being driven mad by the visions they are seeing. There is also a giant apparition of an alien that appears in the sky above Hobbs Lane. The Professor figures out a way to bring the power in the spaceship to a halt by running a giant electrified crane into the apparition and save London.
If you have ever seen Lifeforce (1985), you'll notice the endings are somewhat similar. There are winds swirling around London with debris flying everywhere and sirens going off and some terrific noise all around. People are running through the streets either out of their minds or trying to get away from the madness. And one lone figure knows how to put a stop to all of it.
I hope my description of the movie doesn't turn you off, because despite the goofy sounding story it really is a well done movie. All of the principle actors do an outstanding job, especially Barbara Shelley and Andrew Kier. The first time I saw this movie on TV in the late 70's it was under the title 5 Million Years to Earth. It was probably 10 years before I saw the movie again on TV, and I was so excited to be seeing it again. Fortunately for all of us, Anchor Bay has released this movie on dvd in 1998. What is included on the disk is a commentary by director Roy Ward Baker and a World of Hammer episode entitled ""Sci-Fi"". I have only ever seen one copy in dvd stores and of course I bought it.

Nigel Kneale's script is a landmark of television science fiction, with ideas that have influenced a number of more modern television series (especially ""Doctor Who""). The script itself borrows heavily from HP Lovecraft (especially the ancient alien artefact that drives humans mad) and is the reason why both the television series and the movie are as good as they are. The premise is smart and rock solid, and the characters are extremely well realized.</P>

903742,5,6304632444,"Veteran sci-fi/horror scriptwriter Nigel Kneale's best script, with a great cast and even passable special effects.
British government rocket scientist Bernard Quatermass is more than happy enough to take time out from his busy schedule of helping the Ministry of Defense put missiles on the Moon, to check out an odd supposed German V-weapon left over from the war discovered in the London tubes.  Not only isn't it a missile, but its metal is unknown, and it has unusual properties.  And it's resting on top of five million year old human bones, much older than man is supposed to have been around on Earth.
One odd clue leads to another, with Quatermass and a growing scientific team coming to eventually discover that what they have found is a Martian spaceship  -  complete with dessicated, insectoid Little Green Man occupants  -  that crash-landed all those many millions of years ago.  The Ministry is reluctant to believe that these glorified grasshoppers either came from the Red Planet, or had anything to do with engineering the human race into existence, and plan a public exhibition to put rumors to rest.
But that's when the fun really starts  -  because the ship and its occupants aren't quite as dead as they appear...
This is brilliant sci-fi, a genuine classic, which works primarily due to a superiorly intelligent script and great performances from the entire cast.  Even those not usually into sci-fi will probably love it, as it's really more a great melodrama than anything else, just with a sci-fi premise.

""Quatermass and the Pit"" quickly gets you hooked, as workers extending the London subway system uncover some ancient skeletons to the delight of Dr. Mathew Roney (James Donald) and his assistant Barbara Judd (Barbara Shelley). By the time Prof. Bernard Quatermass (Andrew Keir) arrives upon the scene, the workers have uncovered an alien spaceship and the strange insect-like creatures that apparently piloted it from another planet. Unfortunately the arrogant Colonel Breen (Julian Glover) dismisses it all as a Nazi hoax, nothing more than a propaganda weapon left over from the war, despite the fact the craft is made from an unknown metal. Quatermass deduces the strange creatures might have been ancient Martians and is worried about all the strange psychic phenomenon associated with this area. But Breen and the ministerial bureaucrats have their way until all hell breaks loose in Hobbs End.

Like the original version of ""The Thing From Another World,"" this is a film where the dialogue and the performances make you forget we are dealing with strange creatures from another planet. In point of fact, ""Quatermass and the Pit"" uses a bare minimum of special effects to create its thrills and chills. To be fair, the idea of Martians affecting human evolution to institute a surrogate race war is way out there when it comes to explaining what is going on, but such concerns are forgotten when the giant Martian image turns everybody in London mad and all that is left between humanity and the end of civilization are a couple of scientists and a giant crane.  This 1967 film was directed by Roy Ward Baker, whose eclectic list of credits includes ""A Night to Remember"" and ""The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires."" Baker deserves a lot of credit for the tone of the film, which he maintains even during the final credits as an exhausted Quatermass and Barbara survey the ruins around them.

""Quatermass and the Pit"" aired on the BBC in 1958, running 207 minutes and with Andre Morell replacing John Robinson as Quatermass.  Apparently this was the most expensive British television production to that point in time and with ""The Quatermass Collection"" being released on DVD I am hoping to track it down.

The super intelligent Professor Quatermass  ( Andrew Kier ) along  with an anthropologist, and his assistant (the beautiful Babara Shelley)  are all curious about the  craft buried in the earth. The concept is that  mankind recieved his intellegence from large insects from outer space (only  the ones who find Whoopi Goldberg funny) Any way lots of  excitement and  excellent acting by an extraordinary cast. The vision of large hopping  locusts in army parade type formation was eerie. Great for all you Sci Fi  fans and even for those who like a little suspense...SEE IT WIDESCREEN!",960595200,2,802,5.0
903872,5,6304632444,"The combination of elements in this movie (alien invaders, the supernatural, cranky but brilliant scientists) are the reason DR. WHO and THE X-FILES became such wonderful successes. Indeed, the plot resembles (and probably inspired) any of several DR. WHO plots from the early 70s. The issues explored in the film are fascinating and relevant, and the acting and script are terrific. Without dissing Andrew Keir, Barbara Shelley, or Julian Glover (who are all fantastic--and damned attractive, in Shelley's case), this movie was probably the best showcase for the underrated James Donald, who had important if glum roles in THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI and THE GREAT ESCAPE. Here, the director lets him cut loose and be one of those great scientific yet moral figures that are littered throughout British literature and history. Also, I, too, found the contrasting trailers at the end (with the American emphasis on ""Mars Needs Women!"") gutwrenchingly hilarious. Having heard of the TV series, and reading the other reviews, I'm extremely anxious to check out the original 50s version of the story. Still, as far as feature films go, this is one of the best possible ""midnight movies"" ever.",958953600,2,1192,5.149484536082475
903873,5,6304632444,"I don't have too much to add to previous reviews, however, I would like to correct one of those reviews. Barbara Shelley, not Barbara Steele, is the actress in this film. It may seem petty, but those of us who have seen  these two will understand my nitpicking over their differences. Also, the  army officer, played by Julian Glover, refers to military bases on the moon  being used to patrol the earth. Mars is briefly mentioned in that  conversation, but it takes place before the Martian element becomes  prevalent in the film. I realize this may be petty of me, but I just had to  chime in with these corrections.",951177600,5,618,4.572727272727272

7874975,4,6304632444,"One of my favorite sci-fis, I have watched this movie 4 or 5 times. There is very little about it that is uncredible, at least conceptual-wise. A remake in modern times with updated technology might improve the story, if the cast is as good as this, and if they don't try to make technology the focus (which is the demise of many remakes and sequels). Right up the alley of the X-Files.",1520121600,2,386,4.375
7874976,5,6304632444,"This is a story about Martian hybrids that came to colonize earth five million years ago. One of their ships went off course and ended up in the mud. The ship is found during a subway excavation and the fun begins.

When I was a youngster many movies gave me nightmares such as ""It Came from Outer Space"" (1953) where I kept seeing eyeballs. Now only one movie left to get over, you guessed it, this one. I can not look a grasshopper in the face. And as with most viewers I saw it on late night television as ""Five Million Years to Earth""

This film is logical and spooky especially by 1960's standards. And you get all the stereotypes such as the military that is just determined that this object found buried is a bomb. It makes you want to slap him around. Then there is the professor that knows better and is ignored. I could go on. But you need to see this movie. The only thing that is stretching but fits in a sci-fi movie is the device that changes thoughts into pictures; see this setup again in ""Brainstorm"" (1983).",1501286400,,1025,4.305699481865285
7874977,5,6304632444,"One of my all time favorite science fiction films!  Although it would be considered a low budget production by today standards, it is very
well done. It is more of a thinking persons film, no glaring sound track, no CGI overkill. This was written as a story, not just a fill in
for special effects. If you want something with some meat on the bone, rather than fluff, this is your kind of film.",1501113600,3,394,4.324324324324325
