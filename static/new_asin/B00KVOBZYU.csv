8661914,4,B00KVOBZYU,"I find it interesting the way some opera composers become canonical to the point where their most unsuccessful (often deservedly so) works still get produced while others, equally famous in their day, disappear pretty much entirely. One of the latter group is Gaspare Spontini who had a long career stretching from the the late 18th into the middle of the 19th centuries during which he was active in Italy, Paris, Vienna and Germany. There was a revival of his La Vestale at La Scala with Visconti directing and Callas in the title role but otherwise the 20th century pretty much ignored him. So obscure had he become that the Wikipedia entry for his operas describes hisLa fuga in maschera as ""genre unknown"". Perhaps that's not so surprising as the work was last performed in 1800 and the score was thought to be lost until it turned up in an English bookshop in 2007. Subsequently it was performed in 2012 at the Teatro GB Pergolesi in Jesi as part of the Festival Pergolesi Spontini.
It's a curious workin some ways. It's a comedy with clear roots in the commedia. The plot is ridiculous but the score is actually quite good with a couple of big arias for each of the main characters, often in a slightly parodic style, lots of patter song and tons of quick fire ensembles. The plot concerns a rich, elderly artist Marzucco who wants to marry off his daughter Elena to an erudite doctor Doralbo who is a total fraud. She isn't interested and fancies a vegetable grower; the rather thick Nardullo. Things are complicated because Marzucco's well endowed (in many ways) niece fancies Doralbo. It gets even whackier when the scheming tart Corallina arrives. Her plans to marry Marzucco are complicated by the fact that Nardullo is her brother and owes her a lot of money while she knows all about Doralbo and may in fact have been his mistress at some point. Throw in some whacky servants, a fake seance; set up by Corallina but hijacked by Nardullo, multiple conflicting wedding contracts and a whole series of predictable misunderstandings and there is the basis of a pretty good farce.
The production, directed by Leo Muscato, is interesting. Costumes are a bit cartoonish (which at least helps keep who is who straight) and ""sets"" are realised almost entirely from projections, scrims and back lighting. There's lots of movement and the pacing is what one needs and expects from a farce. It's a bit reminiscent of Dario Fo's famous Barber of Seville which maybe isn't surprising as the whole thing feels a bit like what you would get if Figaro was a bit thick and Despina showed up to pull the strings.
The mostly Italian cast is really rather good. Corallina is sung by Alessandra Marianelli. She's vocally secure and a very good actress. Perhaps the most lyrical singing comes from the impressive Ruth Rosique as Elena. She gets a couple of showpiece arias and sounds very good in them. Filippo Morace as Marzucco is an old style buffa baritone which is exactly what's needed and everybody else is just fine too. Corrado Rovaris directs from the harpsichord with I Virtuosi Italiani on historical instruments in the pit.
Vido direction is by Tiziano Mancini and he does a good job of filming a tricky production. Heavy use of projections is never easy to handle. On Blu-ray the high definition picture and DTS-HD surround sound are well up to standard (There is PCM stereo as well). There aren't any extras but there's a helpful essay in the booklet as well as a detailed track listing which I found essential for sorting out who was who in the early stages of the piece. Subtitle options are English, French, German and Italian.
This is a very enjoyable disk if a bit silly. It's certainly more than just a rescue job from the Valley of Lost Things.",1487116800,,3757,4.728658536585366

Overly long, silly, cute but enjoyable overall.
Not everything needs to be earth-shaking or have meaning for the ages, reveal universal truths, teach moral lessons, deal with human deep truths or foibles.
The cast was fun & quite good in their singing & emoting (for what the Opera is).
I enjoyed the projections & silly costumes.
The orchestra was excellent
The audience seemed to have fun.
Picture & sound were very good as as the cinematography",1477094400,,482,4.819277108433735
8661916,3,B00KVOBZYU,"There is the only video recording I know about this recently discovered opera by Spontini.  For us, the curious opera funs, this interesting and there are some new things to learn, but for the rest you can skip it.
Musically it is interesting since you hear some Mozart components and some that will appear later in Rossini, but it failed to fully engaged me. There are a few nice areas, but not too much more.  The staging is quite creative. I found the curtain made of semi-transparent strips and the illumination as effective as they can be. Making the convoluted librettos in vogue in 1800 interesting to present audiences is always a challenge, and this production doesnt particularly succeed.  The singers are OK, but no more than that. The coordination between the orchestra and the singers is far from perfect, and the sound of the recording, although of very good quality, is not exciting. The costumes are interesting although I am not sure if it helps the presentation of this opera.
In summary, I doubt there will be many additional recordings of this opera, so, if you are curious, it is for you.",1468195200,,1109,4.7357512953367875
8661917,3,B00KVOBZYU,"It's hard to believe that the composer of La Vestale composed this opera.  It's light hearted but a bit heavy handed, and I did not find the singing as impressive as some listeners' reviews promised.  I'm not sorry to have heard it, but doubt I will play it again.",1450051200,,264,4.36734693877551
8661918,4,B00KVOBZYU,"This opera by Spontini, a well-respected opera composer during his lifetime 1774-1851, and thought lost was discovered as recently as 2007.  The opera was subsequently obtained by the municipality of Maiolati Spontini, the composers birthplace. The first modern performance of this newly discovered work was at the Festival Pergolesi Spontini in Jesi, Italy. This recording originates from the same venue and was first published in 2014.

Spontinis writing in this light opera, a relatively early work dating from his Italian period, involves much hair-raising virtuoso writing of the essential ingredients of rhythmic repetition, motoric ensembles and play with word fragments which Rossini made much of. If anything, the writing is even more demanding of vocal dexterity than that demanded by Rossini in some of his more demanding passages.

The plot revolves around seven characters that all have conflicting interests in the matrimonial stakes. Most of these claims to matrimonial bliss are doubtful but at the end of the opera most of the complications are resolved for good or ill.

This could not be described as a deep operatic experience but no-one could doubt the vocal skills of the whole cast who despatch their vocally demanding roles with remarkable and breath-taking skill. These young singers will be ones to watch out for in the future when more emotionally demanding or convincing roles may be expected of them.

Rather than providing an in-depth consideration of each singer within this opera it should be sufficient to list them for the future as equally note-worthy. They are Ruth Rosique as Elena, Caterina Di Tonno as Olimpia, Alessandra Marianelli as Corallina, Clemente Daliotti as Nardullo, Filippo Morace as Marzucco, Alassandro Spina as Nastagio and Dionigi DOstuni as Doralbo.

The orchestra, the well-known I Virtuosi Italiani under Corrado Rovaris on this occasion, provide sharply characterised and scintillating playing throughout. The stage production is more likely to be controversial though.

There is much use made of projected imaging upon the stage curtain to imply alternative situations and scenery. The main male character is supported by three henchmen who are constantly on show and behave non-endingly in a buffoon-like manner. This, if it is intended to be humorous, is self-defeatingly laboured at best and distracting at worst. The main female figure, of superb vocal merit, is required to stand in a gawky pigeon-toed attitude throughout and one is sincerely relieved to find that this is a stage direction when she walks normally on for her well-deserved applause at the end. The whole production is set in a modern context of no particular date or location.

Technically the opera is well recorded with clear and sharp imaging. The degree of involvement will depend on ones response to the production. Sonically the product is excellent and is presented inDTS-HD5.1 and stereo. Sub-titles are provided in English, French, German and Italian. The sleeve notes are informative and interesting.

It is unlikely that potential purchasers will have much choice in this opera as regards further recordings. They will need to be very forgiving as regards the production but will be well rewarded in terms of performance. Comedy is best when not over-worked and this is very over-worked.
