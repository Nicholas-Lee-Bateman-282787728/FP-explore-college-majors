8133562,5,B000GLOF8G,"Very organized presentation: various aspects demonstrated by Bobby Hull, Jr and other very able hockey players. Constructive criticism of the demonstrators technique as well - so you know what to look for to correct your own technique. There is a very young lad as well (as hockey player aged demonstrators) who aptly demonstrates these techniques and this provides a means of showing what you'll probably look like until you get good at it.
I really get the impression that many hockey players just put the roller blades on and run out there and scramble around until they can do a decent job of getting from A to B forward or backward and that the Bobby Hull school of roller blading helps these athletes as well get it all straight.
I've looked at ""The Best Inline Skating Instructions Ever! "" which is good at changing your fundamental approach to skating and I recommend it as well because you'll skate much more efficiently. But this goes into all technique at all levels and thoroughly demonstrates and explains it.
A real polished act!",1313798400,,1043,4.8
