They did a really good job detailing the greatest moments in history for this great organization.  My only fault with it lies in they didn't cover how and when the built the Superdome.  Other than that, they did a good job on this one.  Glad I bought it.  Recommended to any Saints fan.",1383350400,4,425,4.5131578947368425

8594756,4,B00DNF1RV0,"The DVD is great for the price, got it for someone as a gift. Only problem with the item is that the cover looked a little dirty coming out of the package but that was just the print, it looks like someone burnt a copy from the original. Had issues with shipping, sent about 3 emails and eventually everything worked itself out. Only complaint about the Rep. Jeevan G. He or she told me ""anymore inquiries about my order would not receive a response"" 1. It's your job to answer any and all questions that a paying customer has.
2. If you have a problem with the duties of a customer rep maybe get another job.",1482364800,,609,4.258620689655173
