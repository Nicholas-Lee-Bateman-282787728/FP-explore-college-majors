8215285,5,B000UVV2A6,"Overall, pretty good, but you do not need to buy this if you own ultimate knockouts one and two, almost identical.",1233187200,,114,4.476190476190476
8215286,4,B000UVV2A6,"If you love MMA, you'll love this dvd, my wife got it for me as a gift & I loved it. Its just ko after ko after ko. Only down side was that toward the last maybe 3 fights they were longer into the rounds, but well worth the watch for any fan!!!",1232236800,,244,3.6226415094339623
8215287,1,B000UVV2A6,"Like the other reviews have stated, its repetitive. A couple knockouts taken from the ultimate series 1-3 and then they decided to throw in about 20 minutes of garbage stoppages. if your going to have a dvd that is the ultimate ultimate knockouts, you at least better have the silva/belfort knockout. the last 15 minutes is fights that aren't even knockouts; they are long, drawn out stoppages by low level fighters. Dont buy this dvd if your looking for something new in the series or if you think its a greatest hits compilation cuz its not.",1201132800,4,543,4.666666666666667
8215288,1,B000UVV2A6,"Don't buy this item if you are expecting a new knockout video, that is what i did and it was a big mistake. As a big UFC fan I buy all the knockout videos and have never regretted it until this one. This video is the same knockouts that are in Ultimate Knockouts volume 1,2,3 that i already own.",1198540800,6,295,4.016949152542373
8215289,1,B000UVV2A6,"I got this DVD for my BDay, and being a huge MMA/UFC fan I was really excited.  Then I watched the DVD, and my excitement turned to sheer dissapointment.  If you own Ultimate Knockouts 1 through 4, don't buy this DVD, all the fights are on prior knockout dvds.  There are only two new fights on this DVD that aren't on the others, Vera vs. ""Some Guy"" and Couture vs. Liddell 3.  Nothing else is new, there is no Gonzaga vs. Cro Cop, nothing past 2005.  I am beyond disappointed.",1196812800,9,478,4.266666666666667
