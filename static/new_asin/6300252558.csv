I watched the whole movie in three minutes (looked for the nudity in the scrub panel, and stopped every three seconds to listen to the gut wrenching dialog).  Whoever made this movie, and took themselves seriously, should be slapped back into the 70's. Even if you tried to add the power of absolute to Black Shampoo, it would still find its way into the negative values. Horrible Blaxploitation film.

282494,3,6300252558,"They sure don't make 'em like this anymore. ""Black Shampoo"" is a hilariously cheesy exploitation film from 1976 starring John Daniels as Jonathan, a muscular hairdresser who is popular with the ladies. The trouble starts when his new receptionist, Brenda (Tanya Boyd,) turns out to have very disenfranchised mob ties. Hilarious editing and mobster caricatures (seriously, these have to be the worst mobsters ever,) along with unbelievably bad acting make this an oddly entertaining movie. Also noteworthy are the amazing seventies hair and wardrobe: watch particularly for Artie (Skip E. Lowe) the stereotypical stylist in the most astounding pants I have ever seen. I am still stunned by the otherworldly cookout scene (think ""Hee Haw on LSD."") After poor Artie suffers third degree burns from a curling iron in the worst way imaginable, it's revenge time. Although you might think that a chainsaw would be a poor choice as a stealthy weapon, and while many would speculate that bringing a chainsaw to a gun fight might be ill-advised, ""Black Shampoo"" corrects those misconceptions with gleeful abandon. If you enjoy lots of driving around and running through the woods, you have a treat in store here; otherwise you may find this to be occasionally bloated in the running time department. Worthy of special notoriety here is Joe Ortiz as Mr. Wilson, resident mob boss and by far the perpetrator of the worst performance in the film. (Your ribs may ache from the laughing.)

The DVD has a lot of extras including interviews with John Daniels and Tanya Boyd that I enjoyed, trailers, behind the scenes photos, deleted scenes, and a commentary track with director Greydon ""Satan's Cheerleaders"" Clark, which I found interesting and enjoyable. Although the film is padded and would have been better if the driving and running through the woods was pruned down, it gets bonus points for the mobster pool cue skewering and other wholly outlandish scenes that would never be contemplated today.",1416009600,3,1989,5.12

After some bad guys come after the new receptionist, he falls for her & goes after them.  Blaxploitation movie at it's finest.  Tons of fun.",1358553600,,293,4.105263157894737

282539,4,6300252558,"Mr. Jonathan runs a hair salon, but it comes across more like a brothel considering the women lining up for Jonathan's...ahem...services.  Jonathan seems to jump in the sack with just about any woman that steps through the door, yet he comes across as rather bored with ""servicing"" these women.  This changes though when he develops feelings for his new receptionist, Brenda.  Ya see, Brenda's on the run from Mr. Wilson(no, not the guy from Dennis The Menace), who's obsessed with her and wants to keep her for his own.
Mr. Wilson tracks her to the salon and tries to strongarm her back, but now he's got Mr. Jonathan to deal with.
This is Black Shampoo!!  It's a fun blaxploitation romp from Greydon Clark, who as you all remember, brought us such fun flicks as Satan's Cheerleaders and Joysticks.  The first third or so of the film is dedicated to Jonathan's sexploits, then it's kind of a love story, then Jonathan gets to put the hurt on the mobster goons(and they really are goons here!).
Since we don't deal with any real violence or action til the final act, some may find this a tad boring.  The beginning is kind of like a softcore Skinemax flick.  One disturbing scene has Jonathan accosted and nearly raped poolside by two girls who don't look a day over fifteen!  And to make a disturbing scene even more disturbing, Jonathan ends up having sex with the mother of the girls at the poolside with the girls watching from the pool!
The final act is a hoot as we're treated to chainsaw carnage, vehicular manslaughter and curling iron sodomy.  Who can resist watching it now after knowing that?
John Daniels is a memorable leading man, but the character seems like he's swallowed a handful of downers, even during the fight scenes.  Is that one cool cat or what?
The tone is a bit tongue in cheek, but it's not really as funny as it tries to be, especially in a scene where the goons trash the salon.  It's obviously done in a way that's supposed to be comical, but it plays out kinda long winded and just kinda....odd.  There's another odd scene where Jonathan and Brenda are running through the woods trying to escape Mr. Wilson and his goons.  Brenda(I'm assuming)is tired and out of breath, but is making sounds like she's having sex.  It's strange.
In the end, this is a fun piece of 70s blaxploitation, maybe a tad slow at times, but fans of the genre will know what they're getting into.",1353715200,2,2403,4.58411214953271
282540,5,6300252558,"I am amazed at the bad reviews of this film. really? Does anybody understand what the whole blaxploitation movement was about? Black films made on shoestring budgets, in an industry where black folk couldn't get a job in film for about 50 years! This film is what it was meant to be: FUll of sex, violence and a leading BLACK star. It achieves this on all fronts, and is pretty damned entertaining. Read some books if you weren't alive during that time. These films weren't made to win Academy awards, they were made to make MONEY! You want acting, go see Denzel, you want action, this is the film for you! DO some research before you ost pointless comments about ""BAd acting and bad plot"" What did u expect!

I will give the condensed review; Good nudity (check out the 2 PAWG in the pool scene) and sexual innuendo, bad everything else.  I knew it was bad going in but I figured it would at least have some over the top acting and comedic elements - the good news is, it had both.  The bad news is, the over the top acting and comedic elements were terrible (even if by design).  Get if for your collection if you so desire but be warned Black Shampoo needs a perm (and that's a good line compared to what you get in this lame excuse for a blaxploitation film).",1328745600,5,634,4.130081300813008

282577,3,6300252558,"Though I am a fan of blaxploitation movies and I am collecting them all Black Shampoo was nothing short of watching a soft core porn, bad acting and all. Though for me, blaxploitation movies are all about the bad acting and just looking at how far the directors went to make a movie. This movie is indeed ""exploitation"". With scences often having the main character ""whoring"" himself out to women and us often getting a flash of skin every other second this movie is indeed soft core porn. But for its worth it definitely entertaining 1 time and that's the first time you watch it.

Only bright spot, some comedic relief from two members of the supporting cast.

282580,3,6300252558,"Well, this is a wild movie!  First it is weird because it features a muscular guy who owns a hair salon, but his clients seem to go there to get it on instead of wanting their hair done!  It is not an action film, but despite it's ""R"" rating, this film is on par with soft porn!

The first thing that caught my eye on this one is Tayna Boyd (AKA Celeste from ""Days of our Lives"") is in this.  This is what attracted me to the film(yeah, I saw it every now and then).  I know that Tanya is one fine women today, and I was shocked to find out that she went back to the 1970's!  However, I was saddened by her role in this porno.  I doubt if any of the main players got more than $2,000 for their roles, but Tanya was more or less a porn actor before ""Days.""

This film seems to be mainly about sexual encounters more than and plot.  Johnathan, the lead, makes house calls for hair only to be hit on by the clients two (clearly) teenage daughters!  They not only take off their bikini tops, but they take off the bottoms too, and you see it ALL!  These girls looked their ages, so I do not know how this got by!  Then the mother comes out and pushes the daughters away and disrobes and starts riding the guy and yes, you see it ALL!

Then, 'thugs' come by and destroy the man's shop.  His receptionist (Boyd) advises Johnathan that she will leave and go back to her pimp to avoid further problems.  She leaves, then comes right back and starts taking her clothes off!  I always liked what Boyd was packing even today and I always wanted to see what she was workin with - but I had no idea that I would see ALL that she was workin with!  I see it quite a few times in this film!  In fact, she is more or less FULLY naked throughout the movie!

Johnathan is taking a shower (right after his place is destroyed?) and then Boyd joins him for some soft porn shower scene with ALL being seen at times.  Then the next scene is of the two of them waking up nude.  Boyd gets up and you see it ALL, then Johnathan is lying there and you see it ALL!  This film is nothing but porn and I do not know how it is ""R"" rated instead of ""X.""  It is as if the director knew he had no plot so he just threw in a bounch of sex and strong nudity in the film to keep our attention from what otherwise is a piece of garbage movie.

I won't give it all away(!), but later on Boyd goes back to the pimp and Johnathan is paid to stay away, which he does.  Boyd continues to show it ALL.  So sad what Hollywood did to black women in those blaxploitation days.  Then Johnathan goes away after attending a wild party (a nude party for no reason), then he meets Boyd again and acts as if he was in love with her.  We never got the idea that he loved her!  He had sex with other women while she listened ,so she knew it and he took the money with the quickness to back off.  Sounds like love?

This is a wild movie and it is sad that people (Boyd) would go this far for what I am sure is a low paycheck.  Even if it were millions, it is a shame.  She has a sexy body and should have been a model instead.  Well, at least she has respectable work on ""Days"" even if the shows will never be repeated like movies.  For the sex scenes and wildness alone, you might as well check it out.  Not a classic film, but classic for the sex without an ""X"" rating.  It still shocks me that there are so many ho's in Hollywood that will do ANYTHING for a dollar.  If it's on the corner, on video, in a club or in a ""movie,"" it is still the same - prostitution.

This has plenty of cheezy acting, especially from the stereotypical gay hairdressers. The film is definitely not boring, except for some romantic 70s montages in the middle. There's plenty of sex, nudity, and violence resulting in a conclusion that involves chainsaw mutilations and a pool cue impaling! It shouldn't dramatically disappoint fans of the genre, but don't expect laughs like the Dolemite films. After you see it once, you probably won't come back to it.
