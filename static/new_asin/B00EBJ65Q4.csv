5901155,5,B00EBJ65Q4,"This film gives us a small glimpse into the current world of Human Trafficking in Cambodia. ""The Pink Room"" is where the young child virgins are first ""sold and used."" It's inhumane and horrific :'(

While this is a very hard film to sit through for many reasons, the film also shows a great hope for these girls: a ministry that works to not only rescue the girls from the brothels and bars at which they are forced to work, but rehabilitates them emotionally, as well as occupationally.

I would use great caution as to what age group I would show this film. While there is nothing explicit shown, the content is obviously of sexual and slave nature.",1392940800,6,652,4.516949152542373

5901160,5,B00EBJ65Q4,"One of the most heart-breaking movies ever,& something EVERYONE needs to see & know about. It's too easy burying our head in the sand & convincing ourselves ""this couldn't happen here"" but it is just as prevalent ,but not as open in the USA!!!!",1425945600,2,244,4.568181818181818
5901161,5,B00EBJ65Q4,A very well produced documentary on a true story about human trafficking. It will enlighten you about what goes on in the brothels and how one organization is rescuing and training young women to be productive wage earners. I highly recommend this video to everyone who wants to stop human trafficking.,1421798400,2,302,4.9411764705882355
5901162,5,B00EBJ65Q4,"Sometimes people are hesitant to watch documentaries about child sex trafficking because of the difficult, depressing content. However, I kindly challenge people to consider watching this film as it not only exposes the horrors of child sex trafficking in Cambodia, but also ends on a note that will bring a smile. This film is also about hope. It is about bringing hope to some of the most horrific places by being bold enough to find creative ways to bring change. I loved this film so much that I screened it in my hometown. I have personally met a couple of the people who work for AIM (featured in this film) and they are wonderful people. It is well worth the small amount you will pay to view this film, and the money is helping rescue little kids.",1417910400,,755,4.518248175182482
5901163,5,B00EBJ65Q4,"This film is well worth the watch. It's right around an hour, so it doesn't take much time (there's no fluff), and every ounce of the story is told in such a personal way.

Hats off to the director and producers, as this is actually one of the better documentaries I've seen recently, and I'm a huge fan of the genre.

The Pink Room both broke my heart AND lifted my spirits. It is a deeply moving and inspiring story about one girl's hope and courage and also explores what we can accomplish together when we work for the common good.",1411776000,3,535,4.287128712871287
5901164,4,B00EBJ65Q4,"An incredible presentation depicting the heart-wrenching story of sexual abuse and exploitation in Cambodia, and what Agape International Mission is doing about it.  In a season when the issues of human trafficking are hyped by the media and often addressed by individuals and groups without proper understanding and training, AIM is the real deal!",1410134400,3,348,5.444444444444445
5901165,5,B00EBJ65Q4,"Not exactly fun to watch, but incredible nonetheless. The truth of trafficking is horrific even for the listener who has lived so far removed from the actuality of it.  This documentary shows the ups and downs of the war against this brutal crime affecting so many children.  Painful though it may be, it is hugely important that we are aware of the facts and how we can be a part of the solution.",1405382400,2,397,4.424657534246576
8603572,5,B00EBJ65Q4,"Have a box of tissues ready when you sit down to watch this. Can the West please start tracking men who fly to places like Cambodia regularly and thoroughly investigate them? I feel like this problem will never be fixed unless we deal with the root cause. And I mean HARSHLY deal with the root cause. Where there is demand, there will always be a supply. USA, Britain, Canada, etc. pay attention and stop ignoring this evil!

The girls are lovely souls who just needed someone to believe in them and love them just as they are. It's amazing work these folks are doing, bringing hope to the abused and helping to restore their dignity and sense of self worth. It is a shame there is such a need for it, but they are absolutely dedicated to the cause and have helped so many.",1524182400,2,773,4.368055555555555
8603573,5,B00EBJ65Q4,"A Must See Movie!!!  Where there's no demand, there's no supply.  People need to be educated on the moral standards of not selling their children and go for prostitutions in there. I really appreciate these amazing kindness of the organization and all the volunteers working so hard for the cause.  You are all the angels on earth to inspire us to love and help each other! Keep up your wonderful angelic works! God Bless You and Your Family!",1523664000,,442,4.641025641025641

8603577,5,B00EBJ65Q4,Sad but good documentary and necessary to let others in the world know about. But so good to see charities helping in a positive way. I hope others will get involved or at least donate to help these children and girls.,1510358400,,218,4.341463414634147
