8198150,1,B000QXCZKE,"I bought this dvd thinking it would be an hour of Ghost Hunting. What I got was about thirty minutes of a group that seemed to be less organized than they should be, and so many in a room that you could not determine too well what was going on in the investigation. After all that, little evidence was shown.
I am not thrilled with this dvd and wouldn't advise purchasing it due to length.",1258588800,,389,4.2
8198151,1,B000QXCZKE,THIS DVD WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.THE CREDITS WERE LONGER THAN THE PROGRAM.VERY DISAPPOINTED !,1247443200,,90,5.066666666666666
8198152,3,B000QXCZKE,This DVD content was ok but not as good as others I have watched. It was very short for the money you spent but it does have some good ghost hunting segments.,1193097600,2,158,3.96875
8198153,3,B000QXCZKE,"This video is very short and it doesn't show the results of the Ghost Hunting teams' expedition. It's not terrible but ""Ghost Hunters"" on the Sci-fi channel is much more informative and worth-while.",1193011200,5,198,5.03030303030303
8198154,1,B000QXCZKE,"I purchased this for $15.00 and it was not worth it.  It is about 15 minutes long and was just an added news story segment for the nightly news, it is not a show or anything.  They don't find ANYTHING.  (Even their ""orbs"" looked like bugs).",1191283200,4,240,4.173913043478261
