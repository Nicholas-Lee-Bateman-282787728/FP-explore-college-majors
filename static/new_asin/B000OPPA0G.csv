8186250,5,B000OPPA0G,"The problem with most animated productions of classic tales, is well they stink... It is hard to figure out where the good ones are. Thankfully, this one is a treat. This DVD is a full length animated feature, very fun for kids, suitable for age 6 and up. Unlike a lot of what is out there, this one is very good. It has been shown on Nickelodeon and you may have seen it there. It was first released on DVD in 2002. The story is based on the classic Robert Louis Stevenson tale of the same name. A young man meets Captain Long John Silver, and the adventure of a lifetime begins. Sailing ships, pirates, swordplay, buried treasure, it's all here.  I thought it was an enjoyable afternoon of viewing with my son.

This movie is one of those that parents or babysitting teens will not mind watching too. It is 74 minutes long. The animation is fluid, the voice actors are good. Nice animated effects. Extras include bloopers, a behind the scenes show, and fun facts with Inspector Gadget. The same animation studio, ""DIC"", has released several titles to video and TV, such as animated versions of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Treasure Island, Time Kid, Sabrina, Globehunters, Zorro, and Dinosaur Island. The last 2 titles are really good. They also made the Archie's In Jugman movie, and Madeline, Dennis the Menace, and Inspector Gadget. Extras on the disc are Inspector Gadget info and fun facts. DVD quality is good, picture and sound clean, no issues with freezing up or anything.

By the way, until they fix it, Amazon.com is listing this review on both the DIC Entertainment movie, and the same review is appearing on another animated version by Golden Hill Media. They are two completely different movies despite both being animated tales with the same name. My review is for the 2002 production by DIC Entertainment (released to DVD in 2008 for the second time), the much better version of the two.",1262649600,3,1906,4.683582089552239
8186251,1,B000OPPA0G,"Whose going to sit in front of a TV reading (and hearing it read) page after page on the screen of the entire unabridged text of one of the greatest books ever!  I thought the DVD would be some form of dramatization, or ANYTHING, other than what it was.  Better to READ the book, see the movie, or anything, but don't waste your money on this so-called ""DVD"".  Ok,there ya go.",1227571200,11,376,4.267605633802817
