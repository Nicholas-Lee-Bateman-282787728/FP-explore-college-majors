8011805,4,B0001FTWIK,Well Big Daddy Cool was hurt going into the main event but the match was already booked so they did the best they could but the King of the Ring it self was pretty good and Mabel has good heat in all his matches.,1509580800,,212,3.840909090909091
8011806,1,B0001FTWIK,"Quater Finals

Savio Vega VS Yokozuna: Razor Ramon is injuried and his best friend beats IRS pre-PPV to earn the spot. This match sucked, a recurring theme throughout the event.

Bob Holly VS Roadie: Holly looks good in the first few minutes, getting many near falls. The match slows the pace down as Roadie wins after he got his foot up as Holly attempted a top rope move. It looked like Holly kicked out but the ref said it was a three and Roadie advances.

Shawn Michaels battled Kama to a 15-minute draw. I thought it went well even though Kama can't hold a 15-minute match.

Mabel VS Undertaker: 'Taker had this match won, Kama comes out and delivers a weak kick to 'Takers back, Mabel splashes the deadman, and it's over.

This first round was the reason why this is considered one of the worst PPV's in WWF history. Ramon, HBK, Undertaker are all defeated and I guess you could make the case for Yokozuna.

Semi Finals:

Savio Vega VS Roadie: Eh, not a bad match but nothing i'd ever watch again.

Kiss My Foot match featuring Bret Hart VS Jerry Lawler: I guess this is the only match worth watching since WWE has since put this on other sets and left everything else in the vaults. It was good but nothing speical.

King of The Ring final sees Mabel beat Vega. What a bad idea from WWF creative. Mabel can wrestle on occasion but this was the last man WWF should have pushed with business in the crapper. Like I said, three of the biggest favorites were already out by the first round.

Tatanka and Sid VS World Champion Diesel and Bam Bam Bigelow: Diesel has an arm injury and tries to sell it well. Sid-Diesel stunk up the place when they were in the ring. Once again, Bigelow was the MVP of the match and him facing off against Sid and Tatanka went well. It's a shame WWF never used Bigelow to his full poetintal, considering he was a far better wrestler then Yokozuna. Yea it might be a shocker but Bigelow could do so much more while most of Yoko's matches are the same. He would have been a good heel champion. Anyways, Diesel's arm gets better by the end as he doesn't show affects of the injury, and pins Tatnaka as Sid walks off.

Overall, what a stinker. As I said, the only match from the PPV to be released on other sets is the Lawler-Hart match. The biggest draws are gone after the first round and Mabel sucked as the King of the Ring. I don't know if these kids reviews are a joke but believe me, this one is better forgotten.",1337385600,3,2449,4.32532751091703
8011807,1,B0001FTWIK,One of the worst PPV shows of the 1990's. Every match in the KOTR tournament was bad & forgettable. The Jerry Lawler-Bret Hart-Kiss My Foot match was childish & dumb. The Diesel/Bam Bam Bigelow-Sycho Sid/Tananka tag team match was a dud and should hae happened on Monday Night Raw instead of a PPV. I give this show a 2 out of 10.,1283040000,,330,4.338709677419355
8011808,3,B0001FTWIK,"The BodyDonnas-The Underdogs match was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the 8 Divas tag team elimination match. The Goldust-Bam Bam Bigelow match while not a bad bout,I still think of it as a match that should have happened on RAW or Superstars. The Darkside-The Royals match was nothing more then a one sided comedy flop. The ""WildCard"" match was nothing more then a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"". The World championship match between Bret Hart & Diesel(Kevin Nash) was a solid/hard-hitting showstealer. I give this event a 6 out of 10.",1279497600,,552,4.821052631578947
8011809,4,B0001FTWIK,"Marty Jannetty, Bob Holly, Hakushi, Barry Horowitz VS Skip, Rad Radford, Tom Prichard, 1-2-3 Kid: A pretty good openr despite the various crappy gimmicks it included.

Alundra Blayze, Kyoko Inoue, Sakie Hasegawa, Chaparita Asari VS Bertha Faye, Aja Kong, Tomoko Watanabe, Lioness Asuka: Same as any other wreslting review i've done

Bam Bam Bigelow VS Goldust: The final WWF match for Bigelow. It was just a way to put over 'Dust at the time.

Undertaker, Fatu, Savio Vega, Henry Godwinn VS King Mabel, Jerry Lawler, Hunter Hearst Hemlsley, Issac Yankem: A really stupid match. The Undertaker returns, with phantom in the mask in tow. 'Taker eliminated all three men and Mabel gets counted out. This was the customary count out that every Survivor Series featured. I know Taker returned but I could careless.

Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, British Bulldog, Sid VS Razor Ramon, Dean Douglas, Owen Hart, Yokozuna: This was a wild card match featuring faces and heels on the same team. It started off pretty good but went south pretty quick. Bulldog leaps over Razor while trying to break a pin but Razor covers him again and wins. There is little botches till the end as Yoko looks completly bored and doesnt put a full effort in this match. It was a good but nothing i'd go out of the way for.

Bret Hart VS Diesel: I don't know why but i'll always watch a Diesel match. This was one of his best matches against The Hitman. This featured the first table break in WWF history. An excellent match with Hart retaining the world title in the end via small package.

The Wild Card match was fun despite the little botches here and there. The world title match is worth checking out and can be seen on various other WWE dvds. I'd recommend checking it out since 95 was a bad year for WWF, this turned out good.",1258416000,,1804,4.639498432601881
8011810,3,B0001FTWIK,"Thanks to WWE 24/7, I was able to see a good PPV from the WWF in 1995 (and there wasn't alot of them) in the Survivor Series...which featured the return to the WWF of Mr. Perfect.

Underdogs vs. Body Donnas: Marty Jannetty, Bob Holly, Hakushi, Barry Horowitz vs. Skip, Rad Radford, Tom Prichard, 1-2-3 Kid - Just like the usual openers for Survivor Series, this was a good one to kick the show off.  There were two main stories that were being put over thoughout this match and one was Rad Radford trying to become a Body Donna with Skip telling him what to do & having it cost him in the end.  The other story was to continue what happened on the previous RAW where the 1-2-3 Kid alligned himself with the Million $ Corporation & turning his back on Razor Ramon to side with Sid...to the point where Sid came out to help Kid win the end while Razor Ramon was so angry that he destroyed the monitor backstage & had to be forced back into the locker room when he tried to come to ringside.  The match itself was your typical Survivor Series opener with the highlight being the final encounter between the Kid & the underrated Jannetty.

Alundra Blayze, Kyoko Inoue, Sakie Hasegawa, Chaparita Asari vs. Bertha Faye, Aja Kong, Tomoko Watanabe, Lioness Asuka - WWE's Womens Division at this time was based around Alundra Blaze and whatever woman they could bring in for a few months to win the belt before Blaze wins it back.  So with the exception of Faye & Blayze...all the women here were shipped in from Japan & weren't seen in WWF before & after this match so you didn't have a reason to care.  It was alright for what it was but the only footnote for this match was that this is Blayze's last PPV appearence for WWF as she would go to WCW and trash the Womens Championship.

Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Goldust - In a nutshell, Bigelow was just a major named superstar for Goldust to get over on because Bigelow was on the defense a majority of the match.  The only noteworthy thing of this match was the pre-match skit involving Todd P. interviewing ""Bill Clinton"" and Clinton getting scared off by Bigelow's pyro.

Darkside vs. Royals: Undertaker, Fatu, Savio Vega, Henry Godwinn vs. King Mabel, Jerry Lawler, Hunter Hearst Hemlsley, Issac Yankem D.D.S. - This match marked another return of the Undertaker as the match for the most part was it going back & forth between the two teams until Undertaker was tagged in & eliminated all of the Royals while King Mabel ran off.  This is the third time that an entire team survived at Survivor Series.

Wild Card Match: Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, British Bulldog, Sid vs. Razor Ramon, Dean Douglas, Owen Hart, Yokozuna - This was the first (and so far, only) time in S. Series history where both teams were a mix of faces & heels against each other.  This match was also Ahmed Johnson's debut.  This was a very weird match in that you saw things that you wouldn't have seen at that time such as Razor Ramon helping Owen Hart with a double team in the corner on Shawn Michaels along with British Bulldog saving HBK from a pinfall.  There were at times where the teams fell apart such as Dean Douglas' elimination thanks to Razor & Sid attacking HBK after his elimination but overall, a fun match.

No Holds Barred Match: WWF Champion Diesel vs. Bret Hart - The match could only end in pinfall or submission due to their last two matches not having a clear winner.  This match made history...as this was the first time a wrestler went thought the spanish announce table which would become a WWF tradition for the next couple of years.  This was one of the most physical matches in both mens careers as they not only used various weapons against each other (steel exposed turnbuckles, steel chairs, camera cords) but they just beat on each other in what was a slow physical brawl mixed with some good wrestling.  Bret would regain the title in the end.
(Match also available on Bret Hart ""Best There Is, Best There Was, Best There Ever Will Be"" DVD set)

Overall, this Survivor Series wasn't as good as the previous years because of the womens match, Goldust's squash, and Undertaker squashing the entire Royals team in less than 2 minutes (unless your a hardcore Undertaker fan).  The other elimination matches were solid from top to bottom & you got one of Diesel's best matches in his career along with a match Bret was so proud of, he put on his DVD set.  Depending on your taste, if your strickly a fan of the elimination matches then I would recommend but if your looking for a card that is fulfilling from top to bottom...I would wait for the Survivor Series DVD anthology to get this event.",1196208000,,4640,4.511933174224343
