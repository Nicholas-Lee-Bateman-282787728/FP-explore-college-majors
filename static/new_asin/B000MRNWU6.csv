8171401,4,B000MRNWU6,"Uma (Natalia Verbeke) is a flight attendant who loves her job, but something is missing in her life.  She wants a baby.  She visits a sperm bank in London, but is turned off by the clinical attendant who gives her a shopping list of genetic characteristics she can choose for her baby's father.  When Uma returns to Buenos Aires, she confides her dilemma to her best friend, Luca (Nancy Dupla).  Somehow she blurts out that she already has the perfect donor in mind.  The problem is that the ideal man is Luca's drop dead gorgeous boyfriend, Nico (Pablo Echarri).

Reluctantly, Luca gives Uma permission to ask Nico if he wants to be the ""donor"" - no involvement, no strings.  Nico is horrified by the very idea!  Uma's disappointment, verging on black depression, is too much for Luca.  She has a change of heart and does everything she can to encourage Nico to become the donor.  However, once the deed is done and Uma is on her way to becoming a mother, Luca becomes unglued.  She wants to put as much distance as possible between Uma and Nico, which makes her behave coldly with both of them.  Nature takes its course.

""Apasionados"" is a co-production from Argentina and Spain, but its sensibilities are more Hollywood. Had this movie actually been made in Hollywood, Uma would be played by Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts and Nico would have been cast with Hugh Grant or Hugh Jackman.  It's refreshing to see new faces in the romantic comedy genre.  Natalia Verbeke has a very high ""adorable"" factor and does a great job with the role.  Pablo Echarri is quite endearing as the romantic leading man.  After seeing him cast in the vastly different ""Plata Quemada"" and ""El Mtodo"" I have to say the man has range!  Veteran actor, Hctor Alterio (""Plata Quemada,"" ""El hijo de la novia,"" and ""Esperando al mesas"") is terrific as Nico's bemused father.

As a bonus, there are some beautifully photographed stunning locations including the Perito Moreno Glacier in Patagonia, and Ibiza in Spain.

All in all this is a very nice chick flick.
