7913290,2,B00000JRUZ,"This is the third and last of a 3 volume video series on Judo by Hayward Nishoka, a former U.S. Judo champion.  Hayward Nishoka narrates in all 3 volumes.  The demonstrations are almost always performed by others who are most likely students of Hayward Nishioka.  The throw done for the sake of demonstration are all done in very good form.

This volume starts out the first four minutes in the same manner as the beginning minutes on the first two video volumes with Hayward Nishioka narrating a very brief summary comments on the origins of  Judo and praises for Judo and Jigoro kano, the founder of  Judo.

This volume breaks away from the structured presentations format of the previous two volumes.  Instead of being video recorded in a studio, this volume now appears to have been either recorded in a dojo or gym used as a judo dojo during a class or practice session when Judo students in this video happen to be engaged in Randori, the freestyle sparring matches when students try to apply what they have learned to an opponent who will not be so cooperative.  It is competition.  All 3 video volumes in this series on Judo by Hayward Nishioka emphasizes and covers the competitive sport aspect of Judo.  There is no demonstration with emphasis on self-defense applications in this series.  If you are looking for self-defense applications, I recommend that you consider Wally Jay's book and 5 volume video series on Small Circle Jujitsu instead.

After about 20 minutes of  exposure to freestyle Randori, this volume returns to the structured demonstrations of  throws in a studio.  The throws demonstrated are a spinning Uchimata,  Osoto Haraigoshi combination, Koshi Guruma,  Ouchigari,  Kouchigari,  and Kosotogake.

Hayward Nishioka concludes instruction on this volume after only 27 ? minutes has passed since the start.  This is the biggest disappointment because the video cover says that it is 45 minutes long.  For this reason I am not recommending that you buy this volume unless you come across an opportunity to buy it at half price or less or otherwise money is not issue of concern to you and you really have a desire learn the throws I listed above.

Hayward Nishioka authored a small book called ""Foot Throws.""  Only 5 of  the throws covered in that book are performed in this video series.  I do recommend to anyone who is interested in learning about foot throws to buy the book, to read it carefully again and again and to practice the throws covered in that book.  It is a good book.",1146268800,,2513,4.794871794871795
