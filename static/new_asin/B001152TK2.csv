3060446,5,B001152TK2,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, especially since I was a big fan of Ti West's last film, THE ROOST.  That film had a very withdrawn, simplistic approach to genre material and Ti takes that approach even further with this film.  I can see why people wouldn't like this film.  The first half hour is very slow, but it builds to a tremendous payoff!  When the violence strikes, it's quite shocking.  The location work was breathtaking, especially towards the end of the film when our hero wonders through an adandoned factory.  The film does require patience, which will probably be met with a lot of disdain for today's A.D.D. cinema-aficionados, but if you're looking for a different kind of movie-watching experience, I whole-heartedly recommend this flick!  I can't wait to see what Ti West comes up with next!",1207526400,8,829,4.836879432624113

The camera work was horrible and done with a cheap home video camera and the dvd was totally unrealistic.  Basically 3 city punks who know nothing about guns or hunting go off ""hunting"" in a city park with a paved jogging trail a few feet away. They are ""hunting"" in short sleeve tee shirts, all together tramping through what looks like a metropolitican city park. The dvd made no sense and was so boring and poorly done that I had to fast forward through it. The acting was nonexistent and the whole dvd looked like it was produced for less than $100 including gas.  They probably spent more money paying off the reviewers on the cover than producing this piece of trash.",1206403200,3,748,4.452554744525547

8240551,3,B001152TK2,"A loud, fast and simple piece of cut-and-dry, indie filmmaking that hints at films Ti West would later perfect. NOT for the faint of heart.",1461888000,,139,4.6
8240552,1,B001152TK2,"As a completionist, I bought this movie because I've enjoyed most everything I've seen from writer/director/editor Ti West, but I'll be completely honest with you -- you can miss this one and be COMPLETELY OK.  Even ""The Roost"" has its charisma and wacky off-the-wall charm, but ""Trigger Man"" attempts a completely different jump with a new found obsession with minimalism.  The end result is a bunch of shaky cam nonsense with amateur actors, a script approximately the length of this review, and a couple of mildly neat exterior shots with a waterfall.  About three quarters of the film ticks away while we follow some boring actors pretending to do a series of boring outdoor activities, like lying down silently on logs in the middle of a park (no, I am not kidding).  Then, some mystery character starts shooting at them.  We never discover who this person is, or why he's doing what he's doing, and I guess it doesn't really matter, because you're probably going to be asleep by then anyway.

This movie is an hour and twenty minutes long, and it's probably an hour too long.  I am not being excessive or mean in any way.  Once you have watched this movie, you will understand what I mean.

With indie guru Larry Fessenden and Ti West teaming up again, I would've thought we'd be in for something at least as good as ""The Roost"" was, which, while not perfect by any means, it was still at least entertaining.  But this . . . it's just terrible.  Just godawful.  One of the worst movies I've ever bought on Amazon.

And all this coming from a long time Ti West fan.",1456099200,,1570,4.564285714285714

8240554,1,B001152TK2,"The ""Trigger Man"" should have shot every person that had ANYTHING to do with the making of this complete and utter train wreck.  There's an hour and 20 minutes of my life I can never get back.  A shaking camera and creepy music does not make a film scary.  The bad acting, however, mad it HORRIFYING!!!",1441152000,,302,4.357142857142857
8240555,1,B001152TK2,"Ill preface this by saying Im a fan of Ti West (apart from the questionable Cabin Fever sequel) and I truly enjoy slowly building tension, claustrophobic atmosphere, haunting mood, and a sudden, shocking conclusion. I would argue his three big films all succeed in all these areas. However, Trigger Man fails in each. To be honest, I can hardly consider this a movie, per se. It feels like B roll footage that West taped together and called a film. I see what he was going for: true reality, grit, and everyman in a dangerous situation scenario. But the characters are paper thin, especially the lead, who seems to have been lobotomized for all the fear and emotion he shows. And there is no dread, no slow burn; in fact, theres nothing to burn. Even Cinma vrit requires some degree of drama, some human element, at least quality cinematography. Trigger Man feels like a failed college film. Im glad West has moved on to much greater things. We all have to start somewhere.",1433721600,,973,4.662790697674419
8240556,2,B001152TK2,"I can't honestly say I saw a lot of this.  I play B movies as background noise while I work.  I didn't look up much because there is hardly any dialogue.  The music in the beginning really, really irritated me.  The in-city scene did not help me know or care much about the characters.  There was a racial slur about an Arabic owner of the convenience store, which didn't make me like them any better.  One of the guys had given his girl a ring.  One was better off financially than the others.  One was in a bad mood.  That is honestly all I remember about them.  I didn't care much about them when they were hunting.  I was hoping there was some twist, other than someone shooting at them in the woods. The plus is that the make up was unusually good.  I imagine that the wounds were very accurately depicted.  I will try to watch again before my rental expires.  What I saw was one dimensional.",1420243200,,897,4.261904761904762
8240557,2,B001152TK2,"Having just seen Ti West's The Innkeepers, I wanted to check out some more of his cinematic wares.  Trigger Man is one of West's earlier films, and I cannot say I'm very impressed.  With the exception of the special effects, this was a thoroughly amateurish film that feels unmercifully long at a mere 79 minutes.  If you've ever wondered how important music is to a film, watch Trigger Man to find out how bad things get when you have to watch long, boring sequences with no musical accompaniment whatsoever.  It's just brutal.  The very worst thing about this movie, though, is the camera work.  Apparently, the whole movie was filmed by a child who just received his very first video camera.  The camera never stays still; it's always zooming in and out without any rhyme or reason, panning around pointlessly, or shaking like a bad singer facing Simon Cowell.

The plot (what little there is) is supposedly based on a true story.  Basically, these three city guys go out for a day of hunting.  This translates into interminable minutes of them walking through the woods, sans any music whatsoever, with two of them intermittently complaining about not having anything to shoot at.  These woods, I must note, happen to lie adjacent to a park trail, so it's not exactly the best place to be shooting off guns, anyway.  Eventually, the guys take a beer break near the edge of the forest, right across from what appears to be an old, abandoned mill.  Suddenly, a shot rings out.  Thus begins our three incredibly annoying characters' struggle to somehow stay alive and escape from an unknown sharpshooter determined to kill them.  You would think this would lead to some tense, emotional moments - but it doesn't.  If you're like me, you won't care who lives or dies or who the killer is - you'll just want the movie to hurry up and end already.",1351382400,,1845,4.683229813664596
8240558,3,B001152TK2,"Patient filmmaking, to say the least.  As seems to be demonstrated by the array of reviews here, Trigger Man is not for everyone.  But it worked for me ... The suspense was often painful, created by (yes) long stretches of silence without any dialogue ... but waiting for the horror to come (and it does come) and not knowing when or from where ... well it just had me squirming in my seat.

No fast-paced Quantum of Silence/Bourne-style editing here, and impatient viewers who aren't interested in anything but in-your-face fast cuts and loud explosions probably won't even connect to the tension that's building here ... but if you're tuned into that sort of wavelength, you'll enjoy this gripping little walk through the woods.",1288310400,,730,4.870967741935484
8240559,2,B001152TK2,"Having really liked Ti West's newest film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-House-of-The-Devil/dp/B002OVO18A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The House of The Devil</a>, I was anxious to see this film.  I must say that I was disappointed.  It's not bad like so many thrillers made these days are, but it's not that great either.  The main sticking point for me was the camera work.  The whole zoom in/zoom out style was distracting.  I also got tired of seemingly endless shots of the backs of people's heads.  I saw so much of the cast's scalps that I felt I should be checking them for lice.  True, Ti West was able to generate a decent amount of suspense but, I found my attention constantly diverted to the camera as it focused and then went out of focus before zooming in and then zooming out yet again.  The actors deliver decent performances despite the lack of much dialogue for them to deliver (something which actually works in the film's favor), and the film does bring to mind such classic ""stalked in the woods"" films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rituals/dp/B002R2ZC6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rituals</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deliverance-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B000RTB0R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deliverance (Deluxe Edition)</a>.  Despite these good points, it's not enough to save this film from being filed under the heading ""misfire.""",1257120000,,1503,6.5125628140703515
8240560,3,B001152TK2,"I really hate the fact that I had to give this a 3 star rating... director Ti West's first film, The Roost, was such an enjoyable ode to the minimalist horror films of the 70's that it felt like it was made distinctly for people like myself (you know, the guy who constantly rewatches movies like TCM, Halloween, Phantasm, Black Christmas, Dawn Of The Dead, etc., and rarely delivers praise to anything made past the new millenium... yeah, that guy).  Instead of rabid bats that turn people into the living dead (!), this time around we get a story about three friends reconnecting for a hunting trip only to become prey themselves to a mysterious sniper.  Now for the good and bad points...

THE GOOD:
- Feels almost like a documentary with the way it was filmed, putting you right there with the rest of the group.
- Characters look like they could be normal people you'd see on the street (as opposed to the gorgeous types often found in most movies), and are facing off against an all too real threat.
- Builds a nice sense of foreboding and uses the scenery to create some excellent atmosphere.
- Great effects when the bullets start flying (particularly the brain matter!).
- The music is fantastic!  Thumping bass lines that echo back and forth while violens screech and stab at each other, superb stuff!
- For those that hope of making a movie with a dollar and a dream, here's proof that it's possible.

THE BAD:
- Feels like a documentary... filmed entirely with a handheld camera, often with shaky and out of focus results (a friend watching this with me said it made her sick).
- There are only 3 characters that share the majority of screen time (and only 6 all together) and about 30 lines of dialogue is spoken throughout the film.
- Looooooong shots of characters walking through the woods, often not saying anything at all.  It does build suspense (because you know something is going to happen any minute now... any minute... just a little longer... wait for it... any minute now...), however, it's at the risk of losing the more impatient viewers.
- Truly some great effects when death does occur but, with only 6 total characters, death just doesn't occur as much as you might like.
- Sound is important to the film, unfortunately it can be overwhelming at times, even drowning out characters dialogue (luckily there isn't much dialogue huh?).
- By the end, you might realize that making a GOOD movie with a dollar and a dream is harder then it looks.

So I liked it, but at the same time I understand that this won't be a movie the majority is going to want to sit through (even horror fans).  It takes awhile to get going, and even when it does it only switches from a snail's pace to a turtle's pace... also the finale may underwhelm most who feel they deserved more after sitting through the first hour and ten minutes.  Now for those that can appreciate Ti West's vision and his ability to make movies on such a micro-budget, Trigger Man should deliver a solid watch (although I would still recommend seeing The Roost first), regretfully I would warn all others to pass on this.  The DVD from Kino (the company that brought Takashi Miike's Dead Or Alive trilogy to the U.S.) is excellent and features a couple audio commentary tracks as well as a fun videotaped Q&A with Ti and the entire cast.",1213401600,5,3319,4.563025210084033
