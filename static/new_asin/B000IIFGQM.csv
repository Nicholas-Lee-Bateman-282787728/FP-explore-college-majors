8145630,5,B000IIFGQM,"I agree with Zou Jie about movie stars.  That's ironic, because this film uses movie stars and it's pretty good.

Sometimes you need to turn things around in order to make a point.",1404086400,,180,4.424242424242424
8145631,5,B000IIFGQM,I'm a big fan of Zhang Ziyi so it's a no brainer that I love all of her movies.  But I like this one for it's unusual twist that Zhang plays three generations of women in a family.  Bad luck in love and the sacrifices made for one's children.  I truly enjoyed it!,1330128000,,263,3.9245283018867925
8145632,4,B000IIFGQM,"especially the last 15 minutes or so.

Let it not be said that Zhang Ziyi doesn't take on unusual roles, or challenge herself.  In this she gives a tour-de-force, with relatively unpleasant but strong material.  The ending is especially unforgettable.",1243296000,2,251,5.225
8145633,2,B000IIFGQM,"As famous Chinese film director's Zhang Yi Mou's former cameraman, Hou Yong did his best to make this film into a grand piece even with Zhang's help (he read the script and suggested Hou not to use one actress to play three roles).  However, it's obvious that he's lack of Zhang's talent and creativeness. Everywhere in the movie, you can see his effort which very annoying to watch. The movie is based on the short fiction originally written by prestigious novelist Su Dong which was more a stylish writing than a simply story. It written style and language is superb however the story itself has many flaws historically since Su failed to do his research about the 20s' to 30's era.

In terms of acting, Zhang Ziyi did her best to play the leading role, however her lack of experience about life and Chinese history obviously made her acting a lot off balance.

As someone whose family legacy is around the same period of time in the same city Shanghai, I can only say that this movie is a poor attempt to retell a story that portraits the sad and chaotic time from the 20s'  to 80s' of Shanghai.

For someone who is not familiar with Chinese contemporary history, this movie maybe an interesting one to watch, however, to those whose family lived through the same era, this film is too pretentious and phony to watch.",1226620800,6,1320,4.576271186440678
8145634,4,B000IIFGQM,"JASMINE WOMEN is a Chinese chick-flick. A tear-jerker showcasing the top Chinese actress today -- Zhang Ziyi -- playing 3 generations of luckless-in-love young women with Joan Chen (the premiere Chinese actress of almost two decades ago) taking the maternal role to her, whether as mother or grandmother. Evidently, combining the names of the 3 women Zi plays -- Mo, Li, and Hua -- results in the Mandarin word for ""Jasmine"".

Most of the movie's melodrama didn't move me, in part cuz I ain't a chick. And, in part cuz the script was composed of scenes of short bursts ( la Hollywood's impatient style) which fail to produce dramatic depth.

Still, I got fairly involved in the second story set during the Cultural Revolution when the story took a couple turns that I didn't expect. (For a fascinating film of the travails of a Chinese family during Mao's reign, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TO-LIVE/dp/B00005JM6H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TO LIVE</a>&nbsp;with Gong Li -- the immediate predecessor to Zi as the top Chinese star and almost the star of this film.) And I became totally caught up in the film's very intense and very unexpected climax which almost justified the rest of the movie.

At least there were lots of pretty pictures, albeit with a slightly bleached color palette shifting hues with each episode, but still more colorful than today's Hollywood style. With Zi front and center, growing in beauty as the movie progressed, there was nothing to complain about.

In common with Gong Li, Zhang Ziyi is one of the most appealing and potent of actresses ever -- with her child-like beauty, luminous screen presence and sublime acting talent. As usual, she gave it her all thru out the film.

Joan Chen is still stunning and has to be aged by makeup. Unfortunately, she has a fairly marginal role in the first part, but as her roles grow in importance in sections two and three, so does her effectiveness -- altho she remains in the background clearly in support of Zi.

The drama is overall paper thin and, even with the skilled moviemaking technique, is worth 3 stars at best. However, Zi soars above it and earns it an extra one.

The ""My Way"" DVD has a ""making of"" featurette -- in Mandarin -- with no English subtitles (???).",1201478400,3,2295,4.976501305483029
8145635,1,B000IIFGQM,"It is quite rare that I did not even want to finish watching a film. But this movie is beyond just a bad make.  The directorship, the script and the performance in combination is probably one of the worst among recent Chinese films.  Zhang Zi-yi tried.  But even the best actors in the world cannot salvage a movie under such poor construction. The dialogue is as ridiculous as it can be.  Joan Chen's performance is as her usual- plain and phony.  Cinematography is the only thing worth given some credit.  What a waste though.  This movie is a rare trash.",1185926400,6,557,4.51
