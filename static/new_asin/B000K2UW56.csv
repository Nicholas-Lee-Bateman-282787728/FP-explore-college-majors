For instance his riding, gun-handling, fighting-everything he learned at Republic he carried over to the Lone Ranger portrayal -he actually  re-fined all of this and  deepen  his  voice and there you have it-The Lone Ranger!",1389312000,,397,5.125

JESSE JAMES trivia:

Holly Bane (Tim) appeared in an episode of the 1966 TV series ""The Legend of Jesse James.""  Bane portrayed a prisoner.

Silent screen comedian Chester Conklin has a minor comic relief role here. Conklin and his walrus mustache may be seen in Mack Sennett/Charlie Chaplin/Keystone Kops shorts from the early 'teens, right up to 1959's film adaptation of the Broadway musical, Li'l Abner.

Tom Steele, who had several small parts in JESSE JAMES (including stunt-double for Clayton Moore), stunted in over 250 serials and films, such as: ""The Blues Brothers,"" ""Flash Gordon,"" ""Diamonds are Forever,"" ""Gunga Din,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""Buck Rogers,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" ""Mighty Joe Young"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure.""

(""Lone Ranger"") Clayton Moore's first professional job was as a circus acrobat. He was 8-years-old. Moore performed aerial feats at the 1934 World's Fair and also worked as a male model before Hollywood (and 'B' movie limbo) beckoned in 1938.

BIOS:
1. Clayton Moore (aka: Jack Carlton Moore)
Date of birth: 14 September 1914 - Chicago, Illinois (some sources say 1908)
Date of death: 28 December 1999 - Los Angeles, California

Special Footnote, Clayton Moore was a circus acrobat at the age of eight and grew up in the Midwest (Illinois) ... worked in the circus and traveled to New York and then Hollywood where he became a stuntman and bit player ... appeared in various serials ""Peril of Nyoka"" (1942), ""The Crimson Ghost"" (1946), ""Jesse James Rides Again"" (1947), ""The Adventures of Frank and Jesse James"" (1948), ""G-Men Never Forget"" (1948), ""Ghost of Zorro"" (1949), ""Radar Men from the Moon"" (1952), ""Jungle Drums of Africa"" (1953) ... .inducted into the ""Stuntman's Hall of Fame"" in 1982...also received the ""Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame'"" also the ""Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum"" both in 1990...Clayton was once quoted ""Playing him [the Lone Ranger] made me a better person."", ""Once I got the Lone Ranger role, I didn't want any other. I was playing the good guy.""...""I will continue wearing the white hat and black mask until I ride up into the big ranch in the sky."" (On his costume as the Lone Ranger, February 4, 1985)...Clayton very much enjoyed quoting and lived by ""A Ranger's Creed"" which included this moral lesson ""That God put the firewood there, but every man must gather and light it himself.""

BIOS:
2. Roy Barcroft (aka: Howard Harold Ravenscroft)
Date of birth: 7 September 1902 - Crab Orchard, Nebraska
Date of death: 28 November 1969 - Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California

Second Special Footnote, actor Roy Barcroft one of the most sought after badmen of the Saturday Matinee era --- His face appeared in more westerns than any cowboy villain who rode the range in the '40s and '50s --- an complete account of ""Roy Barcroft:King of the Badmen"", which is the title of Bobby J. Copeland's book on the life and times of ""Republic Pictures Number One Villain"". Barcroft appeared in B-Westerns and Serials - became one of the most recognized actors, when you heard that familiar voice --- you were in for it. Roy was one of the few bad guys that once you saw his name in the credits, you were going to get your money's worth. Barcroft was my first favorite and my second was Harry Woods, who in many ways reminded me of each other --- I remember watching Barcroft in a variety of Republic Serials --- ""Manhunt of Mystery Island"" (1945), as Captain Mephisto --- ""The Purple Monster Strikes"" (1945), as the invading Martian --- ""G-Men Never Forget"" (1948), a dual role as the honest police commissioner and the lead villain (good & bad look-alikes) --- ""Don Daredevil Rides Again"" (1951) --- ""Radar Men from the Moon"" (1952), as Retik --- My favorite B-Westerns were the casting of Wild ""Bill"" Elliott and Allan ""Rocky"" Lane vs the under handed dealings of Roy Barcroft, boss, leader of the gang or henchmen --- every frame was B-Westerns at their best --- With knock-down-drag-out fight scenes that gave you everything you ever wished for and more in an action film --- fellow actors, producers and directors all agree Roy Barcroft was as beloved as anybody else in the Motion Picture business.

3. Linda Stirling (aka: Louise Schultz)
Date of birth: 11 October 1921 - Long Beach, California
Date of death: 20 July 1997 - Studio City, Los Angeles, California

Third Special Footnote, Linda Stirling was the most popular action star of serials in the 1940s, she was spotted in an advertisement by executives of Republic Studios, who were looking for a beautiful but athletic woman to star in their upcoming serial, ""The Tiger Woman"" (1944). Despite having no experience in the kind of stunts and athletics that would be required, Stirling was able to convince not only the executives but ace stuntman Yakima Canutt of her capability. She won the role and a contract from Republic, and played hard-riding and -fighting heroines in numerous serials, Westerns, and low-budget adventure films over the next three or four years ... Stirling appeared in three other notable serials ""Zorro's Black Whip"" (1944), ""Manhunt of Mystery Island"" (1945), ""The Purple Monster Strikes"" (1945) and ""Crimson Ghost"" (1946) ... where she rapidly earned the title ""Queen of the Serials."" ... She married Republic screenwriter Sloan Nibley in 1946, then retired from films the following year, had a family and once her children were grown Stirling enrolled at UCLA, eventually earning an MA, a BFA and--at age 50--a PhD ... during 1960s, she began a whole new career as a teacher of college English and Drama.
