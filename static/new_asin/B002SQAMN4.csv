3982049,5,B002SQAMN4,"While I admire the efforts of some to show our hip-hop artists (and all their Bling-Bling), it's nice to see something so well done and put together feature an attractive and articulate group of African-Americans who speak openly and candidly about their many successes and few failures.  It's an inspiration for us all to never stop reaching for success in life...",1359763200,,365,4.983606557377049

8379462,5,B002SQAMN4,"The great thing about this documentary series is that it features prominent African Americans as well as those you will not see on the big screen.  Do not expect a typical HBO documentary style, this is more or less like having a conversation on your couch with some intriguing figures.  It is devoid of typical celebrity rants and just focuses on each persons individual journey, struggles and identity.  Very powerful and a great teaching tool for the younger generation on positive role models.",1395360000,,497,4.963855421686747
