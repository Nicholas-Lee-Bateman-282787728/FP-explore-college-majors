3820079,5,B001V7YZ9S,It was my plesure to buy those dvd's from you  it have been long time ago i was looking for some where to get it from ..thank you for giving me this chans,1325894400,,154,3.6666666666666665
3820080,1,B001V7YZ9S,"I have always been a fan of the Hercule Poirot mysteries and was pleasantly surprised when I bought ""Movie Collection"" Set 4. I had not seen the episodes included on these discs and they were very well done and longer than most of the usual Poirot episodes: as advertised, they were ""Movie"" length. I went on to buy sets 1, 2 and 3 and upon opening sets 1 and 3 was disappointed to find the episodes are exactly the same as the original recordings (which I already owned). These collections are sold using a STRONG suggestion that they are substantively different from the original recordings. I mean, it's only logical to believe they would be. Otherwise, why would Acorn Media sell the collections under the new description of ""Movie"" length? Why, indeed?
If you own ANY of the original recordings of the Poirot episodes listed in the Movie Collections (with David Suchet), don't waste your money on these: they're the same.",1324339200,68,926,4.75776397515528
3820081,5,B001V7YZ9S,"I own all but 2 of the Poirot series with David Suchet as Poirot. I will eventually purchase the whole series, and will be sad when I have come to the end. David Suchet has portrayed Poirot excellently. I do not compare the movies to the Agatha Christies books. I have not read the books but will someday. I enjoy setting down at days end, plugging in a DVD of Poroit and engulfing myself in a life style of England and the world of years ago. It is hours of entertainment that I can watch over and over.
Thank you",1310860800,,514,4.15
3820082,5,B001V7YZ9S,"Well worth the money.  I watch them and then wait about a year and can watch them again and not have a CLUE who ""done it"".  I guess losing one's memory has its advantages.",1306108800,,171,4.0

3820085,4,B001V7YZ9S,"David Suchet is the best Poirot ever.  These are great videos and stories; however, Acorn Media really needs to start including closed captioning or subtitles.  My wife, who is nearly totally deaf, likes the A&E versions because they include closed captioning.  When we watch Acorn Media, I have to stop, explain what's going on and then continue on.",1278374400,21,350,5.0

3820093,5,B001V7YZ9S,"Poirot is always a joy to watch, and I think it's because the lead character is played by David Suchet.  He is a prolific and consummate actor.  Agatha Christie invented a gem of a detective and he lives on in DVD's.",1374105600,,216,4.2439024390243905

3820097,5,B001V7YZ9S,"I haven't seen these in YEARS!!!  I thought they may not be out on video.  So very glad they are.  I could watch my Christis all day, and have!  The movies are true to the books, and Suchet is true to Poirot!  This is a good place to start if you haven't seen any of her books put to film....and, if you enjoy a good mystery, you'll be buying them all up...as I am!  They are timeless which is the sign of wonderful writing.  You can't go wrong with these which were put out by BBC. They love Ms. Christi and have made sure that she was done proud!",1366934400,,548,3.9724770642201834
