1717083,4,B000067J4J,"Well, a really good pay-per-view until we got to the double main events. Hogan and Taker (as much as i like The Dead Man) are single handedly killing the WWE's product.
Billy Kidman and Tajiri actually hold the crowd's attention (which is hard to do when you're a Cruiserweight) with an awesome opener and match.
Scott Hall vs. Bradshaw is better left not talked about
Trish vs. Jazz was a tad disappointing knowing how good these two are when it comes to putting on a good match.
Brock completely destroys Jeff Hardy, making him just another Goldberg wannabe.
In an early Match Of The Year Candidate, Edge and Angle tear the roof off of the house with a ****1/2 match. definately Edge's best match. (look who he was facing)
RVD and Eddie Guerrero face off next in the second of a string of awesome matches. they prove you don't have to destroy each other with dangerous spots to have a godd match.
next, however, the show goes to hell. Austin and Undertaker was supposed to be good/great but these two were way off on this night. what's worse is that they got 30 minutes to put on a match that was extremely boring and unmotivated.
Billy and Chuck against Al Snow and Maven looked like it might be good but it wasn't. Al Snow and Maven looked like they were trying deperately to have a good match but Billy supplied us with the normal suckfest.
Hollywood Hogan is overrated and Triple H hasn't been as good as he was since his injury, so, needless to say,this was horrible. just like 18 years ago, Hogan wins his way to a World Title despite not having an ounce of talent.
Is Backlash worth buying? YES. Watch as Hogan holds down Kidman, Tajiri, RVD,Eddie Guerrero,Edge, and Kurt Angle. Plus, Austin continues to get [cheated] by the WWE as he is put into senseless feuds with guys who should have been retired a year or 10 ago. in all actuality, the whole card, except for the last three matches, is worth watching. just make sure that, as Taker's match comes up, you Fast Forward and don't look back.",1023840000,,2003,4.5054945054945055

WWE Light-Heavyweight Championship
Billy Kidman v Tagiri
This was a great opener. One of the best matches on the card. Billy Kidman is so impressive and I hope to see more crusierweight matches in the future. Lots of high-flying and close pinfalls hype the crowd up in this great opening contest.
Bradshaw v Scott Hall
You would of expected this to be a typical match between two roughneck brawlers. Think again, this was a smash mouth in your face slobebr knocker and the reuniting of the APA hyped up the fans. Bradshaw is ready for singles match-ups and he put it all ont he line, taking a beating but returning twice as bad. The interfernece of X Pac led to Farrooq delivering an APA style butt kicking to the little member of the nWo.
WWE Womans Championship
Trish v Jazz
Oh what a match!!!!! This was great, sexy and watchable in every way. Finally, the women put on a good show (not as good as the womens match at Wrestlemania X8) but still a great contest.
Jeff Hardy v Brock Lesner
WOW!!!That Brock is one tough and strong competitor. He lays out the biggest beaten on a dismantled Jeff Hardy and their are alot of OOOOOS and AAAHHHHS from the crowd. Great Match!!!!!!!!
Kurt Angle v Edge
SHOW STEALER!!!!!!!!!!
This was the greatest and most intense match of the night. Two of the greatest superstars in the WWE go at it. This match had the fans on their feet for 20 minutes! It was tense, brutal and techinal. Both Edge and Angle stole the show with this epic match. A MATCH OF THE YEAR CANADATE!!!!!
WWE Intercontinental Championship
RVD v Eddie Guerriro
Another great match. Alot of high spots and bad falls. These two work well as they both deliver the Frog Splash like no other!!!!
Stone Cold v Undertaker
This was great!!
Maybe a bit to long, but a smash mouth match. Funny in parts and brutal in ways. Flair adds the tension and Austin kicks 3:16 butt like old times. The crowd are wild during this long-awaited match and the ending is unexpected!!
WWE Undisputed Championship
Triple H v Hulk Hogan
LEGENDARY! SENSATIONAL! UNFORGETTABLE! SPECTACLE!!

The cruiserweight title match with Kidman and Tajiri was excellent, better than the Greg Serb/Klo Cruiserweight from the old WCW days. Hooray for Brock Lesnar... they give him an opponent that he can easily beat on... Hardy. They must feed Lesnar kibbles n' bits. Can't wait for Lesnar to lock up with the likes of Hoss Pete. Kurt Angle/Edge match was great, especially with Angle nailing himself with the chair off the ropes. The Undertaker/Austin encounter gets old, even with Flair in there because he makes no difference except for the ending of the match. The championship match was a good one, Jericho was expected to interfere of course, but not the Undertaker. It's too bad they fired Scott Hall recently. Hogan and HHH was an old-style type fight. Hogan defeating HHH at this stage of his career really proves that no one is still better and that he always will be the man now. Hogan will end up as the last WWF champion since it's recently turned to WWE. How fitting. The WWF had a great pay-per-view even w/o The Rock. WWF has done this before when they lost The Rock to Scorpion King filming and Fandrei to Dazed and Confused In Indianapolis. Wonder if they will include any special features, usually they don't unless it's a Rumble, Mania, Summerslam, or WrestleMania... but there have been some.

1717142,3,B000067J4J,"In my opinion, this was one of the last good PPVs the WWE put on.  The card is solid top to bottom, with 3 very good matches and a main event that was very entertainer and climatic.

I attended this show and was very impressed with it from where I sat.  Watching the DVD just confirmed my opinion of Backlash 2002.  I could of gave this show 4 stars but will stick with 3 and give it a strong recommendation.

-Kidman v. Tajiri

This was by far the best match on the show.  Tajiri really showed how talented he is and really gives flashes of his ECW days.

-Edge v. Kurt Angle

This match started their classic feud that ended with Kurt Angle getting the Baron Von Raschke treatment.  Both guys really worked their tails off in this contest - Edge really stepped up to the plate with the former world champion.

-Eddie Guerrero v. Rob Van Dam

Another solid match with Guerrero returning to the WWE and eventually setting up his run as WWE champ.  As much as I like Van Dam he's not as good as Guerrero, and it kind of shows in this bout.

-Hulk Hogan v. HHH

This match was really good live - the heat Hogan got in an old NWA town was very surprising but cool.  HHH is very intense in this match and tries to keep Hogan focused on business inside the ring.  Also, compare how HUGE HHH was then and how smaller he is now...

There are not alot of extras on this disc, but the package about Brock Lesnar's debut is cool.",1115424000,5,1419,4.173431734317343
1717143,4,B000067J4J,"I had mixed emotions about this one. I still gave it four stars because there were some exciting parts that saved it. Tag title match was a dumb idea for a pay per view. And it was silly having Jeff Hardy and Brock go at it this way. Also, sadly, I have to agree with some of what has been said about the World Championship match. I loved Hogan coming back, however it really took the steam out of Triple H's one and only run as the good guy. Which was actually really exciting up until this point. And they ended up having Hogan lose the title to Undertaker the very next month, so this whole thing was really pointless and badly thought out.

Tajiri and Kidman was solid and entertaining. Edge and Angle was totally awesome as usuall. Kurt and Edge stole the show again!

As for the woman's title on this event and all these other pay per views that have been reviewed on here...You people need to lighten up. I know it isn't exactly Angle and Benoit quality or anything, but it is great in comparison to Woman's Wrestling in the old days. And shoot...you get to see two hot babes go at it...How bad could that be? I like the Divas stuff usually. Sometimes they are better than others. And I freely admit they were much better a couple years ago when Lita first came on the scene and all.

So, my opinion is that this is worth it if you were a fan in 2002, and you can find the dvd cheap. I mean...over all 2002 was a great and historically signifigant year for the WWE. And you'll probably want it anyway if you are a Hulkamaniac!!",1113177600,,1534,4.2465753424657535
1717144,3,B000067J4J,"this was an okay PPV from April 2002 which included the first ever meeting between HHH and Hogan. I know what you think, but if you look past that awful match, there were quite some (to be exact: 3) great matches.

1 Tajiri (w/ Torrie) vs. Kidman for the CW Title  ****

excellent opener. good pace, two great workers and some spectacular moves

2 Bradshaw (w/ Faarooq) vs. Scott Hall (w/ X-Pac) -

bleh. one is in the baddest shape he could possibly be (Hall), the other one was known as a member of the boring APA (Bradshaw). godawful match because of Hall

3 Jazz vs. Trish (Women's Title match)  **

good for a women's match, but really, who cares?

4 Brock (w/ Heyman) vs. Jeff Hardy (w/ Lita) **

this was only to get Brock over as a monster heel. nothing really entertaining here except for the awkward ending

5 Kurt Angle vs. Edge  **** 1/2

one of the best matches of 2002. the crowd was HOT for this one. why weren't these two fighting in the main events instead of you-know-who? definately a must-see here

6 RVD vs. Eddie Guerrero (IC Title Match)  *** 1/2

cool match, but nothing really special. lots of nice moves. Eddie dominates most of the match and wins (almost) clean

7 Taker vs. Austin (special ref: Flair) 1/2 *

ugh. both WAY past their prime. slow, dull, absolutely no heat. this is fast-forward-button's favorite

8 Billy & Chuck (w/ Rico) vs. Al Snow & Maven (TT Title Match) *

wow. talk about an useless PPV match. just a filler without any meaningful reason to be on this event. who cares bout these low midcarders?

9 HHH vs. Hogan (WWF Title Match) -

oh boy. one of the worst decisions ever made by the WWF was to put the belt on Hogan right here. nobody really needed that. this match is atrocious. it's real suffering watching this. about 2 wrestling moves are used in the entire match which is WAAAAAAY too long for Hogan (he was 53 at this time!!!). s*it like this is a good reason to hate Vince. of course Hogan's title reign flopped BIG TIME and he had to pass the title to the Taker (another godawful decision) one month later

overall: watch the Tajiri-Kidman, Angle-Edge and RVD-Eddie matches and forget the rest",1112400000,,2155,4.441326530612245

Excellent opener that really had the crowd warmed up. Another example of how good cruiserweights can be.

2. Scott Hall def. Bradshaw 0.5/5

Any momentum the show had from the opener was lost with this snoozer. Should have been an early sign to McMahon that NOBODY cares about Bradshaw.

3. Jazz def. Trish Stratus 2.5/5

Decent women's match with Trish selling a pre-match back injury at the hands of Molly Holly.

4. Brock Lesnar def. Jeff Hardy 2.5/5

The Next Big Thing's PPV debut did what it set out to accomplish, make Lesnar look dominating. Some guy sitting behind me actually thought Hardy had a chance of winning. WOW!

5. Kurt Angle def. Edge 5/5

This was easily the best match of the night and ended up as one of the best of 2002. The back and forth action, false finishes, and hot crowd made this a forgotten classic.

6. Eddie Guerrero def. Rob Van Dam 4/5

Another great match. These two men are true in ring artists, but I feel they could have done more.

7. Undertaker def. Stone Cold Steve Austin Ref. Ric Flair 0/5

This was the worst match I had ever seen in person in my life! Slow pace, dead crowd and a predictable finish. This match isn't worth wasting your time to watch.

8. Billy & Chuck def. Al Snow & Maven 1.5/5

This match had no purpose on PPV to begin with. Match did not deliver anything.

9. Hollywood Hulk Hogan def. Triple H 1.5/5

For a PPV main event this was a dud. Hogan gets yet another run with the belt while more deserving performers get pushed aside.

Amazing way to kick off the show.  Great action from beginning to end.  One of the best cruiserweight matches of the year.  (9/10)

2. Scott Hall vs. Bradshaw

I don't really know why this match was on here.  The WWF has been trying forever to bring up Bradshaw in the singles ranks and finally it has worked, but not for this match.  This was Scott Hall's last appearance in the WWF before he was fired.  Nothing too exciting in the match.  (6.5/10)

3. Jazz vs. Trish Stratus (Women's Title)

Women's match.  Nothing happens.  (2/10)

Lesnar's first appearance at a WWF PPV.  He had already injured Matt Hardy on RAW and he tossed Jeff around like a rag doll in this match.  Lesnar is just so strong.  (7.5/10)

5. Edge vs. Kurt Angle

This match kicked off their long lasting fued.  This match stole the show.  The two have great chemisty together and battled it out to the end.  Good finish with a lot of near falls.  (9/10)

6. Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van Dam (Intercontinental Title)

Eddie's return to the ring started his rise up the ranks.  Good match between the two although it could have been a little better, but Eddie had a lot of ring rust.  (8/10)

7. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Undertaker (#1 Contender Undisputed Title/Ric Flair as Guest Referee)

One of the most boring matches I have ever seen.  The match is very long, slow paced, goes by very slow, and is way too predictable.  (3/10)

8. Billy & Chuck vs. Maven & Al Snow (Tag Titles)

It is nice to see Maven and Snow teaming together, but nothing really happens.  Okay match.  (7/10)

9. Triple H vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan (Undisputed Title)

Not the best match, but it was needed.  Triple H made Hogan look good in this match.  Undertaker and Vince McMahon makes appearances over the course of the match.  (7.5/10)

OUT OF 5 STARS

WWE Cruserweight Championship

Tajiri v. Billy Kidman **1/2

Good, solid match. Nothing outstanding. Lots of high flying and flips and dips that come with the smaller guys. Nothing too great, but very solid no less.

Bradshaw v. Scott Hall **1/2

I'm kinda dumbfounded as to how Bradshaw ended up being the nWo cop, but then again, that's the WWE for ya. Horrible booking for this match but all things considered, these two put on the best show they could given the circumstances. Nothing great here, but again, a passable match.

WWE Women's Championship

Jazz (c) v. Trish **1/2

Actually a pretty decent match! By far the suprise of this DVD. Both use their fulll moveset and do actually look decent in the ring. As far as women's wrestling is concerned, this is a good showing.

Brock Lesnar v. Jeff Hardy **

Good match for Brock to showcase his stuff. Absolutely DESTROYS Hardy. Hardy does a good job of selling as well. Nothing wow. By all means a squash match. But that was it's purpose. Brock was mighty impressive.

Edge v. Kurt Angle ***

An outstanding match! Very good spots and both really look solid here. Match of the night so far.

WWE Intercontinental Championship

Rob Van Dam (c) v. Eddie Guererro ****

Another outstanding match, and this time, IS the match of the night. Eddie's first match back and it's a great show!

#1 Contenders Match Ric Flair Special Guest Referee

Stone Cold Steve Austin v. The Undertaker ***

Good match, but I think these two can do better. The screwjob ending kinda hurt it too... Again, Solid, but nothing eye popping.

WWE Undisputed Championship Match

Triple H (c) v. Hollywood Hulk Hogan ***

As far as actual action in the match, it's slow and plodding. Hogan just isn't main event material anymore, but nonetheless, the match is full of emotion and there's great psychology between the two. I enjoyed it just for the drama, but the action itself isn't anything to get excited about.

Overall this is a decent ppv. The matches are either very emotional or very good in the ring. Only the intercontinental title match really combined both. Worth a buy if you're a big Hogan fan, but other then that i'd go with a solid rental. If you want a decent watch on a friday night, it's worth picking up for a rental. I'd save the big money on this though..",1092355200,,2505,4.6431818181818185

Though the match was awesome it just didn't hold it up for me.
Austin/Taker match wasn't a big deal for me Because It was nothing important except that it's for the no1 contender for the wwe championship....
I give this 3 stars for the match and the
BIG SHOW/SHANE match which stole the show for me.
These two men flat out killed eachother.
This was better than there match at Judgmentday which was 2/3 years ago I think....

Smackdown and Raw brands now may be two totally different style shows, but back then they
were pretty evenly matched. This event had two incredible matches, one a great all-style

Billy Kidman vs. Tajiri
 Typical match from these two, which is very good and exciting. Nothing new here,
Tajiri with his excelent technique and kicks and Billy Kidman an average high-flyer. The
WWE should be careful: while these matches would be considered excellent and ground-breaking

Helmsley wasn't one of them. Talk about boring and over-long. I guess HHH was trying to
relive all those horrid (yes, horrid) Hulk Hogan matches from his youth. I have never seen
a Hogan singles match that didn't involve me getting up and fixing a glass of orange juice.

 Yes! I really love these matches. Jazz is the best woman wrestler I've seen. I can't wait
until she and Victoria lock horns. Trish Stratus is going to be great someday. This was a good
if short, showing.
  rating: 3
Jeff Hardy vs. Brock Lesnar
 I guess you've seen a Lesnar match by now. This is a very good and scary squash match
which shows off all of Lesnar's big moves (except for that shooting star press. Just wait).
  rating: 3
Kurt Angle vs. Edge
 This is Edge and Angle's second ppv match against each other (their first was at King Of The Ring 2001).
As great as that match was, this one is even better. In one of the best matches of the year, Kurt and Edge create some
incredible spots and truly get the crowd behind them. I have a feeling that in a few years these two will be facing each
other in a ppv main event Title match, that one being a match for the ages.
  rating: 5
Rob Van Dam vs. Eddie Guerrero
 RVD, the best high flyer in the world, and Eddie Guerrer, possibly the best all around wrestler in the world, face
off in the best match of the night, month, and second best match of the year (behind Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero, Smackdown nhb).
It is hard to put this match into words. This was without a doubt the match that relaunched Eddie's career. RVD put on a great
performance, obviously upset about his less than stellar match with William Regal at WM 18. Eddie put RVD through some
excruciating submissions and scientific suplexes. RVD gave out some of the greatest spots of the year. These two would recreate
this match later on Raw, this time with a ladder. It just didn't seem quite the same. Many people only speak of RVD as a
high-flyer. This match showed that he has some great technical counters, but in the end it just couldn't beat the technical
wizard known as Eddie Guerrero.
  rating: 5
Stone Cold vs. The Undertaker
 These two have tangled so much, what would make someone want to see this over, say, Judgement Day 2001 or Summerslam
1998? Well, not much. This is the worst match the two have had on PAY-PER-VIEW. While not BAD, this match just pales in
comparrison to those brawling classics. The Undertaker's days are getting shorter, and Stone Cold, while still able to put
on great matches, just has lost some of his juice.
  rating: 2
Billy & Chuck vs. Al Snow and Maven
 Jeez, why did you give Maven a ppv match? He's so green! Al Snow has no character. Billy and Chuck are as lame as it
can get. Not a very good match at all.

1717234,4,B000067J4J,"Backlash 2002 was the fallout from Wrestlemania X8.  Overall it was a decent event.  First of all, Billy Kidman and Tajiri showed the world why the cruiserweight division is the hottest thing in wrestling today as Tajiri tries to regain his title.  Scott Hall makes his last WWE P.P.V. appearance as he takes on Bradshaw.  Jazz defends her Women's Title in a rematch with Canadian hottie Trish Stratus.  ""The Next BIG Thing"" Brock Lesnar debuts on P.P.V. against Jeff Hardy.  Edge goes one on one with Kurt Angle in a definite match of the year candidate.  Eddie Guerrero challenges Rob Van Dam for the Intercontinental Title in another classic bout.  In a #1 contender match, Stone Cold Steve Austin takes on the Undertaker.  Ric Flair serves as the special guest referee.  Teacher and student, Al Snow and Maven challenge Billy & Chuck for the Tag Team Titles.  In the main event, Triple H defends the Undisputed WWE Championship against Hollywood Hulk Hogan.  As far as DVD extras are concerned, there are some great backstage interviews with the wrestlers after they competed in their matches.  There is also hihglights from the Sunday Night Heat broadcast that was on the air just before the P.P.V.  Included is one bonus match which was a handicap match pitting the Big Show against Steven Richards and Justin Credible.

1717238,4,B000067J4J,"WWE Backlash 2002 was great.  The first Pay Per View with the brand extension was not bad at all.  Here are all the matches and how they were......
#1 WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Tajiri (with Torrie Wilson) vs Billy Kidman- A great opening and solid match between two cruiserwights.  The only bad thing was having to seeing Torrie in that ridiculous outfit.
#2 Bradshaw (with Farooq) vs Scott Hall (with X-pac) a match that really could have been.  The rivalry was exiting but this match was boring.  The only exciting thing was Bradshaw (from RAW) being with his former APA partner Farooq (from Smackdown!)
#3 WWE Women's Championship: Trish Stratus vs Jazz- Not as good as the match from Royal Rumble 2002.  Could have been better if there wasn't interference from Molly Holly before the match started.
#4 Jeff Hardy (with Lita) vs Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heymen) a not so good match because already did Brock Lesnar (being so big strong) had an unfair advantage and he was just showing off what he could do to people smaller then him.
#5 Edge vs Kurt Angle- A great exciting match between 2 former buds.  This match led the rivalry up to the ""Hair vs Hair"" match at Judgment Day and made Edge bring the ""YOU SUCK"" T-shirt
#6 WWE Intercontinental Championship: RVD vs Eddie Gurrero- A nice match that deserves two thumbs up.  The Frog Splashes were awesome
#7 No. 1 contenders match for WWE title: Undertaker vs Stone Cold with special guest Ref. Ric Flair- A good solid.  Lots of good moves happened and although the match took a long time there was a real shocking end!
#8 WWE Tag Team Championship: Al Snow & Maven vs Billy & Chuck (with Rico)- A bad match because to Billy & Chuck, all it was about was beating up the rookie Maven.
#9 WWE Undisputed Championship: HHH vs Hollywood Hulk Hogan- a good ending match.  These two put up a good match with their sweet moves.  The interference from Chris Jericho and the Undertaker made the match more exciting.
Overall, I thing that WWE Backlash 2002 was a really good pay per view.  I guarantee anybody who buys will like it.  Get it.",1027987200,,2089,4.598382749326146

1717240,4,B000067J4J,"Backlash was not the greatest ppv but, a good one with some spectacular matches. Lets first start with the DVD extras. First is an interview with Billy Kidman. A Al Snow and Maven interview. Buh Buh Ray Dudly interview. An APA interview. A Trish Stratus interview. A segment on Brock Lesnars impact. And The Big Show vs. Steven Richards & Justin Credible in a handicap match. Now to the ppv.
Cruiserweight Championship. Billy Kidman vs. Tajiri. This was a great cruiserwieght championship match with some great looking moves. We see the Japanese Buzzsaw take the title away from Kidman. I give it 10 stars.
Bradshaw vs. Scott Hall. Okay people this wasn't the greatest match on the card but it was very emotional with great fan reaction when Farooq comes out at the begging to help his former partner. Scott Hall beats Bradshaw with the distraction of X-pac. I give it an 8 stars because of the emotion.
Womens Championship. Jazz vs. Trish Stratus. Molly ruins the whole match at the get go. But some how Trish And Jazz put on a better performance then there Royal Rumble match. And I loved the hurricarana move by Trish to Jazz. Jazz retains her title by submission the STF. Shocking good match. I give it an 8.
Jeff Hardy vs. Brock Lesner. In Brocks debut him and Jeff put on a good match and it wasn't all Brock. Jeff hit some of his signature moves like his Corkscrew Moonsault and of course the infamous Swanton Bomb. Brock wins by knocking out Jeff Hardy. I give it an 9.
Edge vs. Kurt Angle. Im going to use the line the put on the back of the dvd which is... Old freinds can sometimes make the best enemies. And what a match did these 2 put on. Like everybody said show stealer, great pace, great chemistry, great intensity, this was just a great match. The german suplex by Edge landed Angle on his head. Kurt wins by the Angle Slam. 10 star match.
Intercontinental Championship. RVD vs. Eddie Guerrero. This was also a great match these 2 gave it there all. This wasn't a 10 star match for the simple fact that we never got to see the best moves of RVD. He never hit his Frog Splash or his Split Legged Moonsault. Eddie Guerrero wins by his Frog Splash. 9 stars.
Number 1 Contender Match. Stone Cold vs. The Undertaker. Ric Flair special guest referee. Most peole said the match was long and which it was but the match itself was funny. Stone Cold
did push ups flipped off The Undertaker the commentary by The King towards Ric Flair was truely funny. It didn't make sense though why they brought out the NWO. Well The Undertake wins
after kicking a chair in Austin's face and Ric Flair counted the 1,2,3 with the foot on the rope. I give this match a 9.
Tag Team Championship. Billy & Chuck vs. Al Snow & Maven.
Yes this was a dissapointment the match itself was boring and pointless. Billy and Chuck wins by pining Maven after a
superkick. I give it a 6 don't ask me why?
Undisputed Championship. HHH vs. Hulk Hogan. I will be honest the match wasn't bad but I don't like Hulk Hogan and the choice of him winning the title was a terrible jesture by the creative team by WWE. Ok now the match took a little while to get started but it finished with a bang with the interference of Y2J and The Undertaker. Hogan wins by a chairshot from The Undertaker
to HHH and a legdrop. OK match wise it gets a 9. I give it an 7 for the simple fact that Hulk Hogan won and he shouldn't have.
Well thats DVD of Backlash. Its worth buying if you don't buy it at least rent it to watch at least once you won't be that dissapointed. In the words of Mick Foley Have A Nice Day.",1025395200,,3568,4.342814371257485

7963331,4,B000067J4J,"1.) WWF Cruiserweight Championship Match: Tajiri w/Torrie Wilson vs Billy Kidman (c)

Hot off the heels of the first draft/brand extension, Backlash starts off with some fast paced cruiserweight action exclusive to the Smackdown brand. Some ""Torrie"" chants are heard from the crowd early on. This was a short but fun and high energetic match, as you'd typically find in the Cruiserweight Division. Quite a few close calls in this match with one being where Kidman miss a Shooting Star Press, leading to Tajiri capitalizing with a Buzzsaw Kick on Kidan for a really close two count that looked to be the end of the match. In the end, Kidman attempts a powebomb but Tajiri spits red mist in his eyes and pins Kidman for the win. Good opening match. Part of the WCW fan in me, wished Lawler and J.R. mentioned Kidman and Torrie's past in WCW but I should've known they wouldn't. Michael Cole interviews Tajiri after the match about his win and he speaks in Japanese the entire time
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Scott Hall w/X-Pac vs Bradshaw

This was a grudge match to be settled after the NWO had destroyed the APA's office on Raw only a week or two before. Right before the match starts, Faarooq comes out to stand in Bradshaw's corner for the match. X-Pac gets some ""X-Pac sucks"" from the crowd even before the match begins. It's amazing at how hated this guy was even in 2002. Not a very impressive match to say the least. Scott Hall's in-ring performance in 2002 was poor and had some less than memorable matches and this was one of them. We see a lot of outside interference from X-Pac and Faarooq. While Faarooq is beating up X-Pac, Scott low blows Bradshaw and rolls him up for the win. This marked Scott Hall's last WWE PPV match

3.) WWF Women's Championship Match: Trish Stratus vs Jazz (c)
As Trish awaited Jazz, Molly Holly comes to the ring and tells Trish the fans want a pure and wholesome woman like herself to be Women's Champion and not someone like Trish. Molly calls Trish a cheater and the two brawl on the outside. Molly whips Trish into the steel steps and Jazz makes her way down and throws Trish in the ring to start the match. Decent match but nothing really impressive. Jazz and Trish exchange strikes and grapples with each other with quite a few nearfalls. Jazz gets the submission victory, making Trish tap out to the STF
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Jeff Hardy w/Lita vs Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman
This was Brock Lesnar's first PPV match and I forgot how scary and creepy he used to look when he first got started in WWE.. Jeff tries to attack Brock as he enters the ring but it backfires as Lesnar throws him around the ring both in and out like a ragdoll. As the massacre takes place, Heyman verbally taunts Lita on the outside, blaming her for Jeff's punishment. Jeff makes a comeback and manages to knock Lesnar down. Jeff successfully hits a Swanton Bomb on Lesnar and he kicks out, shocking Jeff. Jeff goes to the outside and grabs a steel chair and tries to attack Lesnar with it, but Lesnar counters it into an F5. Lesnar breaks Jeff in half with 3 powerbombs and the referee stops the match, awarding it to Brock Lesnar.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Kurt Angle vs Edge
The classic and underrated Angle/Edge feud had began on Smackdown a few weeks before and lead to this treat of a match. This is what you call a fantastic wrestling match! So much action and at a fast paced rate to keep the interest flowing. Just when you thought one move/finisher/signature had the other down for the count, they got the shoulder up with a close nearfall, continuing this awesome match. Even J.R. and Lawler sounded like they enjoyed it. I've always been a fan of Angle vs Edge matches so this was really fun to watch. In the end, Angle counters a Spear with an Angle Slam and covers Edge for the win. Overall just an amazing bout, but their rematch at Judgment Day would be a whole lot better
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chris Jericho comes out and complains about being left off the Backlash card and complains that people like Billy Kidman, Trish Stratus, and Maven have matches but he doesn't and reminds everyone that he was the first Undisputed Champion. Kind of a pointless segment to be honest but it was a nice heel promo from Jericho though
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero vs RVD (c)

Eddie Guerrero had recently returned to the company following his downfall with drugs in 2001 and he was in pretty good shape. Eddie played a great heel in this match, seeming to be more vicious than he ever had been in his WWE career at the time. Guerrero and Van Dam had a unique and similar style of wrestling and it showed in the ring as fans got nothing less of a fairly good technical/high-flying bout in this Frog Splash vs Frog Splash match. After a referee bump, Guerrero gives RVD a neckbreaker on the Intercontinental Championship and comes off the top with a Frog Splash for the win.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) #1 Contender Match: The Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (Special Referee: Ric Flair)
With Ric Flair having problems with both Steve Austin and Undertaker and both wanting a shot at the WWE Championship, he put them both in a match for the #1 Contender spot and made himself the special referee. This was 2002 and Stone Cold vs The Undertaker had been done more than enough times prior to this PPV. They had title matches against each other, non-title matches, and closed quite a few PPVs from 1998-2001. At this point Austin vs Taker wasn't as interesting as it would've been in 1998 and unfortunately the match was pretty bad and probably the worst one they'd had against each other. For starters this match tended to go really slow and it didn't help the fact that this was the longest match of the night either. As much as I hate to say it, 99% of Austin's matches in 2002 were bad and completely forgettable. I think most of that has to do from the fact that his work schedule was catching up with him and he wasn't as in shape as he used to be, which would probably explain why 2002 was his last year as a full time wrestler. The end comes with Taker booting a chair in Austin's face after Austin tried to use it on him. Taker pins Austin for the win but Flair failed to see that Austin had his foot on the rope the entire time. An angry Austin lays Taker out with a Stunner after the match

Jonathan Coachman approaches Ric Flair backstage and brings it to his attention that Austin's foot was on the rope when he made the count  and asks what he has to say about his mistake. Flair simply responds with a hilarious ""oh sh*t""

8.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Billy and Chuck (c) w/Rico vs Al Snow and Maven

Quick filler match to follow that really had no meaning on the PPV. Chuck superkicks Maven and Billy makes the pin for the win

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WWF Undisputed Championship Match: Hulk Hogan vs Triple H (c)

This was part 2 of Hogan's comeback story. After his match with The Rock at Wrestlemania, Hulk Hogan was now focused on trying to get back the WWF Championship, a championship he hadn't held since 1993. It's pretty much battle of the powerhouses for this match. The early going of the match was a bit of a bore with numerous power grapples and strikes. The match picks up a bit mid-way through until the end. There was a nice part from Hogan in the match where he planted HHH with a Diamond Cutter but J.R referred to it as a modified neckbreaker. The final 7 minutes of the match become really chaotic. Just as Hogan seems to have HHH beat following a leg drop, Jericho runs down and takes out the referee and nails Hogan with a steel chair. Jericho tries to revive the referee to make the pin for HHH but Helmsley attacks Jericho and throws him out of the ring. Just moments later, Undertaker runs down and strikes the referee and attacks HHH with the chair. Hogan gives Taker the same treatment Triple H gave Jericho and attacks Taker, rejecting his help and tosses him out of the ring. Hogan takes advantage of the situation, Leg Drops HHH for good measure to get the win. Hogan was once again back on top as world champion. It was a decent main event to say the least and Hogan was still moving around nicely in 2002 for 47.

Overall: Backlash 2002 was a fairly good PPV. Not as great as it was the previous few years but it held up. It was mixed with a blend of good and bad matches. On your good side you got matches like Tajiri vs Kidman, Angle vs Edge, and Guerrero vs Van Dam. On the bad side you had borefests like Scott Hall vs Bradshaw and Stone Cold vs Undertaker; 2 matches that are best for skipping or napping through. Really, Backlash served as a prequel for Judgment Day as it set up tons of matches that would take place then such as Jericho vs HHH, Angle vs Edge III, Flair and Big Show vs Austin, and even Taker vs Hogan. Overall, Backlash 2002 gets a 4/5 stars. Austin vs Taker and Bradshaw vs Hall prevent it from getting a full 5 stars",1430352000,,10307,5.182091346153846

Crusierweight Champion Billy Kidman VS Tajiri: An excellent way to kick off the PPV. I enjoyed this match and the ending looked cool with Tajiri winning the title.

Scott Hall VS Bradshaw: Could have been a classic but Hall is way past his prime. APA reunites before the match as X-Pac is at ringside with Hall and gets in a few shots during the match. Faarooq came to even things out but didn't help. Hall wins with a low blow and a roll-up in a bad match.

Woman's Champion Jazz VS Trish Stratus: I saw the last few minutes and it wasn't bad but not enough to make me watch more women wrestling.

Brock Lesnar VS Jeff Hardy: Hardy gets his offense in but Lesnar was still an unstoppable force. Not really much else I can say.

Edge VS Kurt Angle: A great match.

IC Champion RVD VS Eddie Guerrero: I enjoyed this match, these two had great matches against one anther.

Steve Austin VS Undertaker: Ric Flair was guest ref. I agree this match was plain boring and Flair cost Austin a shot at the title in the end. When Coach shows Flair that Austin's foot was on the bottom rope, his reaction describes this match.

Billy & Chuck VS Maven and Al Snow: A bathroom break

Hulk Hogan VS Triple H: A typical Hogan match even though he did wrestle a good match. Hogan captures the world title with help from The Undertaker.

While the cover says World Wrestling Entertainment, everything on the dvd is WWF.

7963337,2,B000067J4J,"Backlash was the first WWF PPV after the start of the RAW/SmackDown brand split and you can see why this one wasn't done well as it was just absolutely horrible with alot of dull matches with an occassional standout but not enough to get you through this 3 hour show.

Crusierweight Champion Billy Kidman vs. Tajiri - This was the right way to start off the show off as these two gave you a good crusierweight match that was filled with wrestling & some high flyin'.

Bradshaw vs. Scott Hall - The APA reunited in this match was Faarooq was in the corner to counteract X-Pac in Hall's corner.  This was just a drawn out brawl between the two that really got dull & dry most of the time.

Womens Champion Jazz vs. Trish Stratus - Molly Holly beat down Trish before the match so it was mostly just Jazz finishing Trish off while Trish sold the beating.  Not a good womens match.

Brock Lesnar vs. Jeff Hardy - Hardy was nothing more than a body for Brock to abuse & beat down to the point where he was knocked out & the referee stopped the match.  This could have been saved for RAW...not a PPV.

Edge vs. Kurt Angle - This was the beginning of a great series of matches between the two.  Edge had singles matches before but none of them before showcased how Edge could wrestle a main event callibur style of match until this one.  This was the match of the night for me only to be topped by each match afterwards in the spring of 2002.

Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Eddie Guerrero - The battle of the frog splashes here.  This was better than their Judgment Day encounter but this performance was topped by their RAW ladder match.  These two meshed well with their arial & mat based styles.  This was the second best match of the night.

Stone Cold vs. Undertaker with special referee: Ric Flair - Honestly, this match was a long & boring 30 min. encounter.  Unlike their previous matches where they had some wrestling, brawling, and just absolute crazyness throughout the match...they just tried to straight up wrestle for half an hour & it just came off as boring & flat.  Not even the ""Flair"" factor saved this match for me.

WWF Tag Team Champions Billy & Chuck vs. Al Snow & Maven - This match was boring as well...SmackDown was heavily lacking tag teams at this time but yet drafted the tag team champions to that show.

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Hollywood Hogan - This began Hogan's last WWE title run as Triple H made Hogan look like a million bucks in the ring. The finish started to get a little too screwy but overall, the match was good.

(Also available on Hogan's Anthology)

In the end, there were only two matches worth paying for (Edge/Angle & RVD/Guerrero) but their best encounters are on other DVD's more worth your buck.  This is a PPV that I would skip off as this PPV overall was medicore.",1179446400,4,2824,4.411196911196911
