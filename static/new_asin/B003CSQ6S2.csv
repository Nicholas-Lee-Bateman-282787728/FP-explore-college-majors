8394461,4,B003CSQ6S2,"For reviews of the movies, see the individual titles.  This product is currently at a good price for a double feature two-disc DVD.  I ordered it and got the same Xenon discs as the single releases; they are just in a single case.  ""Shaolin Traitorous"" starring Carter Wong, Sammo Hung, and Polly Kwan is widescreen with burned-in subtitles and is the better of the two movies.  ""Wu Tang Swordsman"" stars Carter Wong as well and is fullscreen and English dubbed.  It's not in the same class as ""Shaolin Traitorous"" but hey, the double set is currently cheaper than either single DVD if you buy it new from some Amazon sellers.

This is a great value for the money if you are an old school kung fu fan.  If you are not a big fan, then beware of the ""Shaolin Traitorous"" single audio track (Mandarin) and the non-removable English/Chinese character subtitles which appear to be fairly literal translations without regard for idiomatic meanings.",1301184000,2,942,4.777777777777778
