I received this little jewel in the mail the other day not really knowing what to expect. What I expect now is to be at Soulive: Bowlive - Live at the Brooklyn Bowl next year in Brooklyn, New York.

The former owners of the famous and sorely missed The Wetlands, Peter Shapiro and Charley Ryan, were seeking a new venue for some tremendously talented musicians. What they found was an old dilapidated building that, at one time, housed the 16 lane Brooklyn Bowling Lanes.

It was a dirty, trashy, decaying mess, and God only knew what else was wrong with the place. However, the two have access to the right side of their brains, and were able to see this literal ""hole in the wall"" was indeed the place they had been looking so hard for. All it needed was ""the soul"".

They renovated the building, restored the lanes, and overhauled the kitchen, enabling them to provide three of their favorite things as well as music, food, bowling, and mine!

The Soulive provides the soul and are Alan Evans, Neal Evans, and Eric Krasno with guests Nigel Hall, The Shady Horns, Ryan Zoidis, Sam Kininger, James Casey, and Blake Hillard.

On this incredible DVD, one is blessed with, not only hearing some fine music, but seeing all of the magnificent performers as well. Guitarists such as Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes and Charlie Hunter grace the stage with their talents, along with some of the biggest names in Hip Hop. Names like Questlove, Rahzel, and Talib Kweli.

 If that were not enough, some of the greatest artists around, who grew up and cut their teeth at The Wetlands are also present. The DVD has special guest appearances by Robert Randolph, Marco Benevento, and Oteil & Kofi Burbridge.

Ivan Neville takes the stage performing Stevie Wonder's classic 1973 tune, ""Jesus Children of America"" with Nigel Hall. Says Neville of Soulive, ""These are some of my favorite people...I'm a fan!""  Then when asked from what genre this music is he replies, ""Good Music, the genre is Good Music!""

I could  not have said it better myself.

Also included on this amazing DVD are Susan Tedeschi, The  London Souls, and a whole lot more.

It is all expertly directed by Karina Mackenzie, placing the viewer on the stage with the performers, making this lavishly well produced (Jeff Krasno, Peter Shapiro, and Morgan Young) DVD the very next best thing to actually being there.

An added bonus to the DVD is that it gives the viewer the choice of watching the entire documentary complete with commentary, or you can simply watch and listen to all of the great music. I would suggest you watch the documentary first, so you can get the entire feel of the event that lasts eleven days in March, and get the history behind it all.

My only moan in this entire 122-minute DVD is that I would have liked to have seen more of Mr. Randolph and his pedal steel. That is just me though. I am a huge fan of his. In the end, I was more than completely satisfied with virtually every performance on this DVD.

This is a documentary any connoisseur of American music consisting of Blues, Hip-Hop, and R&B, will want to have in their possession. It releases March 23rd.",1301097600,9,3161,4.634408602150538

8411894,5,B004047Y0G,"it's a really amazing dvd. i like how it's broken up into a discussion/interview with a guest musician then they jam a song together.
you can also watch the show without listening to the interviews.
if you're into jam bands and/or extremely talented musicians, go for it",1400544000,,270,4.76595744680851

It was the perfect time to make a DVD, and they have now released upon us a majestic feast swimming in funk and seasoned with great guests. If anyone wants to know what is going on in the music scene today that is not related to pop music, look no further. Some soulful music is created, booties are inclined to shake while listening to such music.

It is a part-documentary part-music with the great option to switch between interview-free or with interviews. Unfortunately, one great performer is cut out during the interview-free section. Neal Evans has a camera which sometimes wobbles with the music in a distracting way. Despite these slight technical difficulties, the DVD is great.

It is weird how Robert Randolph is talked up so much but we only get a minute of his set, no one even talks about Rahzel, and while Kofi Burbridge plays backup in almost every song not a single solo was put on the DVD. Marco does not play on the dvd. They actually spliced the performance of Rubber Biscuit so it did not include Kofi's flute solo, which I thought was a little cheesy. However, the rest of the huge array of performers are all in fine form, and it is fun seeing them all playing with the monsters of soul. At the end of the movie, I only found myself wishing for a few more jams of just soulive, without guests. Then I went to scene selection, and found 5 extra tracks of soulivey goodness, from all eras of their career. They end with a rendition of Everybody Wants To Rule the World which is absolutely incredible, and a great note to end the whole DVD on.

However, some of the performers are in a better than average shape: ?uestlove and his funky james brown drumming, Ivan Neville and Nigel Hall having fun and going crazy, Oteil's bass solo and accompanied leg wiggling, and then Derek and Susan of course tear the house down. Oteil Burbridge's solo is simply one of the greatest bass solos, and there is such an air of joy and fun around it that it becomes irresistible.

Buy the dvd if you love music, because Soulive is one of the tightest bands around, and the performers are some of the best, just having fun and rockin' out.",1301875200,4,2249,4.478048780487805
