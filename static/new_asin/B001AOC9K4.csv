3455409,5,B001AOC9K4,"""A Four Letter Word"" is one of the best times I've had viewing a movie in a long time.  The movie sails along, holding your attention until the credits roll across the screen.  A lot of the credit goes to the director and the editor, but this is also a fine-looking cast, especially the lead actor, Jesse Archer, who's one of the handsomest men in film.  More to the point, he is fun to watch as well and he dominates every scene he's in.  This is not meant to be a deep, analytical view of gay men and sex in the new millennium, but a fun romp with interesting characters.  If you want to be entertained, this movie will certainly do it.",1222905600,35,638,4.19672131147541
3455410,3,B001AOC9K4,"This is a popcorn and soda movie with a heart.  It's a good date movie, so I won't say much about the plot.  The main characters are all charming and cute, but they are all stereotypes--charming, cute stereotypes whose adventures are fun to watch.  And the ending is happy in the right way.",1221523200,4,290,4.433962264150943
3455411,1,B001AOC9K4,"Bought this movie based on some recommendations and the fact that Charlie David was in the film.  I usually don't write reviews, but this movie was insufferable.  I prayed for open nudity just to give it a purpose.  The dialogue was cliche and felt like it was written by a 15 year old.  Horribly bad movie--clicked one star but should be no stars--in fact they owe me a star.  Run, don't walk, from this film.  If I can save one person their $15, I've done my job.  Karma.",1220572800,14,473,4.306818181818182
3455412,2,B001AOC9K4,"This is a technically well made film, which is notable for a gay-themed film because so many low-budget projects like this are not.  Picture and sound are at professional levels.  Unfortunately, the acting, story and just about everything else is not.  It has some amusing scenes, but just as many pointless and boring ones.  If you're really bored, and keep your expectations low, you may find it worth watching.  I struggled to get through it all the way to the end.",1220054400,10,468,4.728395061728395
3455413,4,B001AOC9K4,"The night after a guy he meets at a bar declares him to be a ""gay clich,"" flamboyant partyboy Luke (Jesse Archer, who also co-wrote the screenplay) is bothered enough about it to ask his friends if he is ""too gay,"" but seems unlikely to take their advice.  When he meets up again with Stephen (the guy from the bar, played by Charlie David from ""Dante's Cove""), Luke finds himself - for possibly the first time in his young gay life - open to having a stable and loving monogamous relationship. Knowing Luke's track record with guys, his friends scoff at this possibility, but can also see the change in Luke since he met Stephen.  But Luke's dreams seem impossible, when he catches Stephen in several lies, including how he earns his comfortable living and fancy apartment.

This is essentially a sequel to producer/director/co-writer Casper Andreas' 2004 comedy ""Slutty Summer,"" which introduced several characters, including Luke and his straight, alcoholic friend Marilyn, as well as also taking place in the trendy Chelsea area of Manhattan. There's an underlying lesson about self-acceptance and following your dreams, but the film suffers from poorly-directed overlapping stories and some incredibly cheesy dialogue, as well as a gratuitous ""nude male yoga"" scene that has nothing to do with the story. It's still fun, however, and has some interesting eye candy; I'll give it four stars out of five.",1219622400,18,1407,5.030042918454936
3455414,5,B001AOC9K4,"'A Four Letter Word"" is the best gay comedy of 2008!  Not a gay farce (ala ""Another Gay Movie') this charming film is a fast paced romp through Manhattan following three diverse couples - gay, straight & bi-racial - as they traverse urban life in the 21st Century.

With high production values this follow-up to 2006s ""Slutty Summer"" (also starring Jesse Archer and directed by Casper Andreas) is a giant leap forward in the overall quality of gay independent cinema.  The 2007 winner of the 'Outfest"" Outstanding Screenplay Award.

3455459,4,B001AOC9K4,"Oh my gosh, I loved this campy movie if not just for the stereo typical gay characters.  Jessie Archer was hilarious in his role as the flamboyant gay man seeker.  Its a fun comedy with enjoyable characters.",1406851200,,207,4.5675675675675675

3455461,4,B001AOC9K4,"So, the character's hair-do on the pic actually scared me and I put off watching this film. Finally, in need of something to smile about, I rented it. This film was a truly happy surprise. The characters are silly and flawed, very entertaining. While there is a bit of raunchiness to the dialogue, it is relevant and humorous. So, the gift of laughter, although priceless, can be bought here for a $1.99 . I'm not sure if the characters cross the line on stereotypes. I am not gay, but I assume this film was intended mostly for a gay audience. Therefore, I assume the characters are not offensive. Silly, yes, but they are sweet and the overall message of the film is positive to all (in my humble opinion). Anything that makes me laugh out loud is a treasure...watch it!",1397520000,2,772,4.521428571428571
3455462,3,B001AOC9K4,"First up, production value for this movie was surprisingly good given the movie's limited $125,000 budget. Hooray for digital cameras and other advances, I suppose. And it doesn't feel like a home video or anything like that - it's an honesty decent movie. As much as story is important, it also helps when the video quality isn't bad and the whole things ends up feeling like an amateur adult entertainment video, if you catch my drift.

The story itself is quirky, but still interesting. Andreas was a little ambitious in trying to juggle three separate stories all at the same time and I think we could have done with less of that, or perhaps those stories could have been simplified to some extent. The one that suffered the most involved Derek and Peter since all we know is that they had a bit of a fight, they spent a wee bit of time apart, and then they get back together.

It's kind of funny in a sad way that Stephen's character gets away with calling Luke a gay stereotype when he embodies a gay stereotype as well. He's supposed to be the one who's more obviously into his body and also seems to take the time to meticulously pluck their eyebrows and try to look all pretty. But hey, it's a movie and we'll take what we can get.

Although the Luke-Stephen story is pretty much the main arc, it still felt a little shallow and underdeveloped. Their conflicts are horribly petty, even though Luke does generally have some limited basis for being all snoopy and paranoid. But his change of character in trying to be monogamous did feel rather forced even more than it was presented to be and the ending just felt a little odd.

The guys in the movie were mostly pretty fit, although more on the twinky side. So the gratuitous sex scenes weren't entirely disappointing (or at least weren't horrifying). Things are still stay on the comedy side of the equation as much as possible, so that's a good thing. Had this movie gotten too serious, it might have lost all value.

All characters do get resolved, but not in a manner that's at all satisfactory. So A Four Letter Word is decent but nothing amazing and doesn't really contribute anything new to the LGBT movie world.",1395273600,,2178,4.545918367346939
3455463,5,B001AOC9K4,"I laughed a lot, the characters are interesting, and I actually wanted to see the ending. That definitely doesn't always happen. If you're not sure if you'll like it or not, I think it's worth taking a chance!",1395014400,,209,4.526315789473684
3455464,4,B001AOC9K4,"A Four Letter Word is a fun movie with interesting, entertaining characters. I enjoyed watching Slutty Summer and it was nice to see a continuation of some of the characters in A Four Letter Word. I find them both rewatchable, along with Violet Tendencies.

3455469,4,B001AOC9K4,"One of the better gay themed movies. Full frontal nudity to enjoy, especially the nude Yoga instructor. There is more full frontal nudity in the extras, especially the nude Yoga instructor :). Canadian actor Charlie David (real name Charles David Lubiniecki) seems to be in every gay movie these days but is a very wooden actor and just plays himself. The other actors also just play themselves but the story is interesting, as well as the scenes filmed in New York City. You will enjoy this one.",1355616000,2,496,4.712643678160919
3455470,5,B001AOC9K4,"A fun funny movie about gay life in New York.  I loved the interactions between Jesse Archer and Cory Grant's characters at their work.  But my absolute favorite part of this movie is Jeremy Gender as Mace.  From the incredibly hot opening scene to seeing him in drag at a party he steals the movie for me.  I was thrilled to get to see more if him in the special feature about his character.  If you like gay romantic comedies with a subtle message, you'll love this one.",1349136000,,472,4.318181818181818
3455471,4,B001AOC9K4,"Good, that's a four letter word to describe this film.  A Four Letter Word continues the stories of the characters Luke, Marilyn, Peter, and Derek from Casper Andreas' earlier film Slutty Summer. It was interesting to see what happened to these characters after their slutty summer. This film also continues the exploration of the the themes of sex and love but adds relationships and communication to the mix.  As anyone who has had any life at all knows, relationships are tricky things and honest communication is rare. The characters of Luke played by Jesse Archer and Zeke played by Cory Grant provide a counterpoint in this examination of attitudes about life and love. It is a sweet moment when when Luke rises above being a gay cliche and grows up a little. Unfortunately many of us have had a dose of ""pretty poison"" as supplied by the character Stephen (with a ph) who is well played by Charlie David. Once agian you get a film with some substance delivered with some snappy dialogue and cute guys. Now really what more do you want. I vote yes on Mace.",1345334400,2,1062,4.6436170212765955

3455474,2,B001AOC9K4,"I am giving 3 stars, 'cause I managed to watch the movie without taking a break :)
It is full of cliches, the characters are really as thin as a piece of paper. Is it really so hard to shoot a good gay movie? Without: all the drama queens, people pretending that they are able to play, unrealistic plot?
Gay life isn't all about sex, f****ing, drinking and cheating.",1286841600,2,366,4.318840579710145
3455475,5,B001AOC9K4,"A Four Letter Word is a really nice romantic comedy, finally a Romance as I like them. Jesse Archer's character, Luke, is ""slutty"" enough to be cute rather than sad, and for how much ""disenchanted"" he professes to be, he falls hard for Charlie David's Stephen (and you can blame him?). Stephen is the perfect dream man, with also all the trouble that a dream man comes true has. Friend and co-worker Zeke (Cory W. Grant) is the classical true love you have to open your eyes to see. And I can't not love this movie since one of my favorite Man Candy, Max Rhyser, has a little role as Long John, he is so young and cute ;-) So, if you want to finally see a good romance, A Four Letter Word is right up the alley for you.",1278288000,,719,4.142857142857143
3455486,2,B001AOC9K4,"As another reviewer pointed out, the script to this film must have been written by a kid it is so predictable. There are cheap cliches throughout, which is extremely common in gay comedy these days. Black penises, the token Latino queen who uses only sexy Spanish words, the ""boa wearing queen"" etc, ENDLESS silly sex jokes, lots of failed attempts at being edgy via interracial ""relations"" and EXTREMELY unrealistic pairings and situations. Yes, it's a comedy...but it's got to at least be a LITTLE believable, right?  I live in L.A. (Hollywood) and total total queen on total queen lovin' is a rarity. Any guy in a boa in broad daylight is not gonna get laid. Period. In this film EVERYone's after the lead [ultra-flaming] guy (Luke), even another character who is at first appalled by him, is suddenly, for no good reason what-so-ever, in love with him.

There is a very good looking black guy in this film (JR Rolley), but even his beautiful face cannot make up for his total lack of acting ability. The front counter gay at the sex shop (played by Cory Grant) is probably meant to be the most likable character, but in fact, he comes off as self-righteous and banal.

Virginia Bryan is a great actress, but in this film, she is completely unnecessary. If her part was cut, it would have made no difference in the film.

To tell you the truth--the only memorable part was just a minute or two long. There is a HILARIOUS queen (Adam Joseph) singing a song called ""Faggoty Attention.""  At first my friend and I said ""did he just say 'faggoty attention'?""
This singer apparently thinks he and the song are both really sexy and it makes for a screamingly funny scene, but is interrupted by more nonsense from the script. I'm gonna look that guy up, he seems like great fun to hang out with.

If this film is supposed to have a message beneath the cringe-inducing low-grade comedy, it is lost (in the over 2 hour film!).  It can never compare to a gay comedy film with a powerful message like 'But I'm A Cheerleader' or the totally precious 'Ma Vie En Rose.'  This one is an easily forgotten film.",1262476800,4,2096,4.570666666666667

3455493,2,B001AOC9K4,"I knew a film maker who died very suddenly and I remember thinking: ""What does a film maker leave behind?"" This thought was the seed that sprouted the movie: Beatific Vision.

I found myself thinking of a secret film that a character would leave behind when he dies. Not one he wished not to be found but one he planned to be found. More than a final will and testament this film was a ""Beatific Vision"", a view into the future of all characters and a clear mapping of the coincidences that would occur.

As I began to write the screenplay the voice of the Angel started to speak softly and occasionally. Upon many re-writes the Angel voice was vieing for main character status. I tried to reel in the angel but he (Angel Chad) wrestled control away from me.

When another close friend was passing to the other side, she added a strong dose of acceleration to the writing process. There now are so many Angels (most recently my Mother) involved, I feel I am at best the living hands to this project.

When I was a small boy my parents used to call me: Angel Michael when they wanted my behavior to change. I actually grew up thinking I was an angel including my sprouting scapula wings. Today, I do not think I am an angel but I surely believe that I am their vehicle for expression on earth.

Thank-you angels for this ""angels on earth"" experience!

The frivolity of their gay world never seems funnier then when these two get together, but when I thought about it, I realized that these two characters co-created by director, Caspar Andreas and Mr. Archer break through sexual mores without utilizing the typical devices and constructs that are likened to most other gay movies. I am intrigued to see what comes next from these two gifted men, and I hope they don't spend too much time worrying what others have to say about their movies, including myself.
