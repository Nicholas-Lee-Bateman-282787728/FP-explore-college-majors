841778,2,6304337434,"I was looking forward to this adaptation since I have always loved the book and the 1983 miniseries.  Unfortunately, this one disappoints.  They have transformed the characters, in particular Mary and Patience, into different versions of themselves.  Patience is a more involved participant and not the ""miserable drudge"" that she is described in the book.  And Mary also seems more willing to participate rather than upholding her principles.  Even Joss doesn't seem to evoke the same terror which may account for Patience's reinvention as a character.  I have also seen the Alfred Hitchcock film, and although I've never liked it, it was better than this version.  The 1983 miniseries (with Jane Seymour) is by far the best adaptation of DuMaurier's Classic.  Unfortunately, that miniseries seems to have disappeared from circulation so we are left with this ""updated"" version, which basically falls flat.  If you have never read the book or seen other films and have no expectations, you might have a different opinion.  If, however, you are familiar with DuMaurier's work or earlier interpretations, then you will be disappointed.",1459641600,,1134,5.284916201117318

841833,4,6304337434,"I'd read that there was ""a lot of mumbling"" in this, but I didn't believe it until I saw it. It would work well on the big screen, but it was difficult to catch everything at home.
That being said, this is a wonderful production of Daphne Du Maurier's book. I felt that it was very accurate to the storyline and to the gothic romance. It has a Jane Eyre feeling to it. The characters are very well portrayed and as real as they were in the book. Costumes and set were very detailed and accurate as far as I could tell.
This miniseries did not disappoint.",1458000000,,554,4.186915887850467
841834,4,6304337434,"I didn't know anything about this series except that Jessica Brown Findlay (whom I loved in Downton Abbey) starred in it, and it was an adaptation of a Daphne de Maurier novel, one that Alfred Hitchcock had used for one of his movies (I've never seen the Hitchcock version).  I was doing some shopping for myself and others, and this popped up in my ""you may also like"" list.  It looked interesting so I bought it.  Watched it over two nights and enjoyed it very much.  Findlay did a fine job as Mary Yellan, the young girl who goes to live with her aunt and uncle at the Jamaica Inn and finds herself trapped in a world she wants no part of. It was slow-moving, especially part one, but I never got bored or gave up on it.  As for the ""mumbling"" issue, I am from New York (or ""New Yawk""), and have one ear that doesn't work as well as the other one, but I had very little problem understanding the dialog.  I did put on the closed captions, but only occasionally did I missed a piece of dialog and needed to go back to read what somebody just said.

One problem I did have is that at the end of Part II, the coming attractions pretty much exposed who one particular mysterious character was.  I had suspected this character, but it was a poor idea to show moments from an upcoming scene that basically revealed the character.",1457827200,,1326,4.2971887550200805
841835,2,6304337434,"I am SICK AND TIRED to be lured in to a story that ends up with the protagonist changing into a bad girl and falling for the bad guy. That's the resolve, and I don't like it. I never did. I absolutely HATE when modern writer and filmmaker focus on the bad, make the good girl change into a bad girl, and portrait the good guy as boring and make him finish last. Good became bad and bad became good. A warning to stay away from the disappointment this turned out to be. Watch ""Going Postal"" which is a great eye opener on how this story should have turned out.",1457740800,,559,4.090909090909091

Charles Laughton plays a mentally deranged British Landlord and keeper-of-the peace on a Caribbean Island that leads a band of killers that plunder helpless ships and sells all the booty.

I'm rather surprised that auntie wasted so much money producing this especially since HTV West (ITV) did an excellent version in 1983.  Even though I'm not a fan of Jane Seymour,  that three-part ITV program, which also starred Patrick McGoohan (The Prisoner), Trevor Eve (Waking the Dead, Kidnap and Ransom), John McEnery, Peter Vaughn and Billie Whitelaw, is without a doubt the superior modern version.  I also found the BBC's background music distracting --  too modernly moody and atmospheric.  Yes, this BBC program is an beautiful costume drama and the story is interesting; but, if you want the better version of du Maurier's Jamaica Inn,  buy the 1983 ITV dvd also available from Amazon (it's PAL format but good all-region dvd players are currently available for under $40.)",1434153600,,970,5.062893081761007

I kept hoping Mary would become smarter and see through her love interest, Jem, and his intentions.  He did admit to her openly that he had ""7 or 8' different 'wives' scattered around, yet she was still willing to give up her honor to him knowing he would never marry her?  It was very ooc for a woman in the 1820s.  I don't care how trailblazing she was supposed to be -- that would have been unhearrd of.  When she literally rode off into the sunset with him (or rain-set?) I just shrugged.  She was so ooc and foolish, and he was so promiscuous, I figured they kind of deserved each other.

I also kept waiting to like the uncle and aunt, but the uncle just got more awful and horrible as the series went on. To be honest, I felt this way about pretty much every character in the movie.  I also saw the 'twist' early on (about 45 minutes in), so it wasn't remotely a surprise when the Big Baddie was revealed.  Yawn.  The resolution with the Big Bad at the end was also completely unbelievable and made no sense.

The only thing I did love was the cinematography and set design.  You felt like you were almost in a lifeless dungeon when you were at Jamaica Inn, and the vicar's house was set up nicely to be a counterpoint to that.  The costuming was great and the settings were perfectly chosen.

Here's hoping Jessica picks something a little happier next time around.  Between this and A Winter's Tale, I don't know how many more angsty movies of hers I can take!",1433116800,,1783,4.3545454545454545

842354,5,6304337434,"Jessica Brown Findlay ( the late great Lady Sybil to us Downton Abbey devotees) shines in her role as the orphaned Mary Yellan in 1820s Cornwall. This lush adaptation is based on Daphne du Maurier's gothic thriller BUT even if you did not read the book or watch the Alfred Hitchcock's theatrical version, this new rendition of Jamaica Inn deserves to be enjoyed totally on its own merits. Banish the nagging voice of your high school lit teacher and instead appreciate the stark but beautiful background (most of us are unlikely to visit Cornwall, so the setting is a nice bonus.) and intense performances by a cast perfectly suited to this intriguing period piece. When Mary arrives to live with her aunt and uncle at their isolated inn, she's quick to realize that the lack of paying guests and her uncle's smuggling ring make the Jamaica Inn a place of fear, desperation--and murder. Even as Mary grapples with the grim circumstances of her new life, she finds herself distracted by an intriguing man who happens to be the brother of her terrifying uncle (Mary's suitor will be familiar to fans of ""The Paradise""--yes, that's Matthew McNulty, attempting to steal her heart). Mary's story spans three episodes, and Acorn provides appealing cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage of this drama whose details, from dialogue to costumes, is superbly entertaining.

842355,1,6304337434,"Poor Daphne Du Maurier. BBC adapted and turned Frenchman's Creek into an uninteresting melodrama (despite Tara Fitzgerald's nude scene). Now Jamaica Inn has been turned into a woman's lib three hour bore adaptation! Suspense is at a premium here: nothing is well defined. The extended drowning sequence is so unnecessary and adds very little to the otherwise sedate screenplay. The winner is the photographer who lovingly evokes the wild Cornish coast of the original novel. (I don't know where it was actually filmed but it is eye catching.) The acting is adequate, no one seems to be really understanding their role, they are like wooden puppets being strung along listlessly. I see Rebecca at least once a year, the perfect adaptation of a wonderful book. The new Scapegoat is good. Why BBC massacred this nice novel is beyond conjecture.

So consider this a review from someone who just likes a good period drama, free from any preconceptions about how the original story ""should"" be portrayed.

Mary Yellen (Jessica Brown Findlay) is twenty years old when her mother dies, and in the year 1821 she travels across the Cornish countryside to join her Aunt Patience (Joanna Whalley) at Jamaica Inn. It's a desolate place with no guests and no neighbours for miles around - the sort of place you'd never stay unless you had no choice.

Her uncle Joss Merlyn (Sean Harris) is a terrifying man, and it's soon apparent to Mary that something strange is going on: whispered conversations, mysterious night-time visitors, her aunt's nervous behaviour - it all points to one obvious conclusion; that her uncle is a wrecker. After luring ships onto the rocks with a false light, he and his men then drown the sailors and seize the cargo.

Mary is naturally horrified at this - but who can she turn to? Though she strikes up a tentative friendship with Father Francis Davey (Ben Daniels) and his sister Hannah (Shirley Henderson) in the nearest village, Mary still finds it difficult to confess her uncle's misdeeds, especially when she's drawn to his younger brother Jem (Matthew McNulty), a known horse thief.

The situation tests her moral compass as she weighs her knowledge of the smugglers' crimes against their obvious desperation, and growing evidence that there's someone else above her uncle who is orchestrating the murderous ventures.

Jessica Brown Findlay puts in a strong performance as Mary Yellen, a somewhat amusing casting decision since she's best known as aristocratic Lady Sybil Crawley from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>. It's as though she deliberately sought out the most dissimilar character possible while still remaining in an English period drama. She's backed up by a strong supporting cast, particularly Joanne Whalley as the fragile but stubborn Patience and Sean Harris as Joss Merlyn, a man who truly looks like he's capable of anything.

I wasn't particularly sold on the courtship between Mary and Jem; a lot of grabbing is involved, and I'm not sure when Mary's disgust with him turns to attraction (or why), but director Philippa Lowthorpe makes good use of the beautiful countryside, particularly the mist-covered and windswept moors. That said, this isn't a ""pretty"" period drama; it's grim and dirty and has little in the way of attractive costumes or sets to admire.

Plenty of scenes are shot in the dark, sometimes making it difficult to see what's happening, and the heavy accents can be a challenge to comprehend (and that's not counting the sound problems that marred the airing of the first episode, though presumably this has been cleared up for the DVD release) but ""Jamaica Inn"" is still an atmospheric drama with a strong cast and high production values.

Divided into three parts, the first episode is quite slow-going, but it gets better and more interesting with each instalment.",1427328000,,3558,5.842003853564547

The poor residents along the Cornish coast would benefit from the flotsam and jetsam that washed ashore from shipwrecks. Sometimes beacon lights would be fixed to draw a ship to wreckage upon the rocks. There were never any survivors to these planned wrecks. One happy laborer whistles while he works. A coach does not excel in customer service. A young woman May is going to her relatives who own Jamaica Inn. We soon learn about Sir Humphrey and his connection to the gang at Jamaica Inn. May hears and sees what they are doing! May saves Trehearne and they escape together. [This is a common theme in Hitchcock's films.]

Sir Humphrey dispenses the law in these parts. Trehearne's discloses his identity to Sir Humphrey, and they go to search Jamaica Inn. But the gang surprises and overpowers them. Will the hero escape from his captivity? Will the wreckers be frustrated in their crimes? Will the evil villain be brought to justice? Soldiers arrive to capture the gang. There is a dramatic ending to this story, which was adapted from a Daphne Du Maurier novel.

One advantage of this film is the demonstration on how to load a flintlock pistol. Hitchcock's films often used an authority figure as the villain. His films were improved after he moved to Hollywood and got a bigger budget.",1427328000,,1343,4.75107296137339

This beautiful, but somewhat simplified, adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's novel received a very mixed welcome by critics and fans alike.  Many fans will still love this version.  Though it loses some of the important symbolism and ritual, it strives for a slightly less melodramatic style and natural feel.  Whether fans appreciate this work may depend on what elements you can sacrifice, for the elements that are gained.  With the compressed run time (still 3 hours), Du Marier's skillful suspense can be slightly lessened while the film itself can be more visually stimulating in it's colors of the moors and the more earthy feel of the story.  Strictly judged as an independent period drama from the novel, it is obviously a darker topic with a wilder beauty of the moors.  It is not a drawing room drama and I really enjoyed the earthy tone of this tale that explores a different side of life than many of the other period films I love and own.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  The year is 1821 - one year different than the novel.  20 year old Mary Yallen (Jessica Brown Findlay, Downton Abbey) travels to the austere coast of Cornwall after the death of her mother.  The only family she has left is an aunt who is the wife of the innkeeper at a lonely place in the middle of Bodmin moor (locations are mostly real though the characters are fictitious).  Fellow travelers are surprised she is headed to the way station many miles from the other hamlets of the parish.  When she arrives late at night, she is surprised to find a much changed woman in the form of her aunt Patience (Joanne Whalley, Willow).  The formerly happy young bride is now a bedraggled and defeated woman.  Her husband and innkeeper Joss Merlyn (Sean Harris) is an imposing man who is angry in nature, ruined by drink, and haunted by nightmares.  Nevertheless, the locals seem to either respect or fear him.  Mary quickly deduces that Joss is orchestrating smuggling activity in the region.  This puts her in great conflict because her own father was killed at the hands of smugglers when she was just a child.  Mary also has a feisty nature and a strong will.  Instead of this placing her in greater danger, it becomes her saving grace.  She is contrasted with her submissive aunt, but her show of force gains the respect and even protection of the wolves around her.  As time passes, she is torn by her need to avoid trouble for her aunt, and to expose those who do the things she despises.  All the time, she is pulled further and further into their world.  Darker revelations await her as she seeks answers and a way out.  Her situation is further complicated with the introduction of the innkeeper's brother Jem, who seems no better of character, but is at odds with his brother Joss.

OTHER THOUGHTS AND COMPARISON TO THE NOVEL:  (Still no spoilers for those who haven't read the book)  Where the novel has room to develop more suspense and mystery, the movie gives us austere but beautiful imagery and sounds.  The book describes a moor of hills black with heath, granite tors, and occasional rays of sun during the misty fall and winter.  The movie gives us an evocative image of green grass against the ruddy heath, envelopes of fog and greyish granite stone formations.  The book visuals can be more bleak (to the gothic image), while the austerity in the movie can be surprisingly gorgeous.  Key scenes from the book are either removed or condensed to help the movie progress, but change the feel of ritual and symbolism that are an important device and explanation of motive.  That certain pagan symbology is still there, but more clumsily inserted.  For literary purists, you may really dislike the changes.  For those able to enjoy it more as atmospheric period drama with some mystery, you may appreciate it more.  The feeling is more earthy, less melodramatic in some ways.  That may appeal to modern audiences.  There was also some complaint that the actors spoke too softly and the regional accents were hard to understand (and that was from British audiences).  Americans may have even more trouble with hearing the dialog.  I didn't think they ""mumbled"" at all.  The regional accents of less educated characters were a challenge, but I felt I understood almost everything.  It was more the sound mixing against a word here or phrase there muffled by sweeping noises or the relentless wind outside.  There are secrets being passed and moments where the dialogue is supposed to be quiet.  If worse comes to worse, you can use the subtitles.  Joss is also not the giant of a man (nearly 7 ft tall) that he is in the book.  However, Sean Harris portrays a character every bit as imposing.  Go into it knowing what to expect (or skip it if you know you won't like the changes).  Chances are you will like it.  I enjoyed it as a completely separate work from Du Marier despite its generally faithful structure.",1424563200,,5103,4.698985343855694

842823,5,6304337434,"Jamaica Inn is a 5 star movie because of its historical value as much as being a very good movie. Very few movies touch at all upon the corrupt and criminal elements in the both the lowest classes and highest classes of 1800's manorial England. Jamaica Inn does a superb job of presenting the hazards of nature and lawlessness of coastal Cornwall to which many Americans can trace their ancestry.

After watching Jamaica Inn it is very easy to see why so many of our ancestors fled for a better life in America. Late 1800's western United States is incorrectly romanticized as the ""wild west"" where every train was at risk of being robbed and every person at risk of being shot by gangs of roving outlaws.

But Cornwall, England in 1819 was the true ""wild west"". And Jamaica Inn presents and preserves that more correct version of history. Yes, it is black and white. The video and audio quality are poor. But that is no reason to downgrade the rating.

And the nonsense about it lacking suspense or being slow comes from people who want to sound intelligent and are incorrectly projecting Hitchcock's overly self-critical statements about the film. Hitchcock was always self-deprecating when it was not deserved.

The movie was a box office hit at the time and has never been out of distribution. If it was as bad as the 1 star reviewers are saying, it would not be fast approaching it's 100th anniversary in vigorous circulation.

The acting is superb. The story is superb. Those giving it low ratings are copying and pasting what they see in the Wikipedia article on the film or using 2014 standards to judge a 1939 film.

The camera work is often excellent, and the performances are interesting in that hammy, stagey way so characteristic of the era (and of Charles Laughton in particular).  But just when you're ready to chalk the film's deficiencies up to the fact that it's an OLD movie, you note that it's actually from 1939--and that many movies looked absolutely gorgeous in 1939--to say nothing of being well-edited, skillfully acted and much better preserved than this relatively minor entry in Alfred Hitchcock's oeuvre.  To think that this was made only one year prior to Hitchcock's classic Hollywood debut effort, REBECCA (also based on a du Maurier story, interestingly enough).  Makes you wonder how much of a difference was made by the bigger budgets and more advanced technology that Hollywood offered.  I'm guessing a lot--either that of Hitchcock grew artistically in leaps and bounds in the year between making JAMAICA INN and REBECCA.

843056,5,6304337434,"Why this is regarded as a lesser effort puzzles me, it's a favorite in my household.  Hitchcock himself practically disowned it but artists don't always get it when they have to share the limelight.
Jamaica Inn bears little of the suspense traits of classic Hitchcock but it is full of wry humor and juicy performances.  If Hitch did sleepwalk through this production as some have claimed, it's evident that at least the actors had good fun.  Especially the great and hammy Charles Laughton. Sir Charles and the supporting cast of dissolute pirates strike just the right tone of grime and insanity (Johnny Depp's jack Sparrow would feel right at home).  Laughton chews the scenery with great gusto, sending up Hitchcock's favorite target: the British upper class.  A very young Maureen O'Hara is beautiful as the willowy catalyst and the set is a great one, a lair of disjointed and claustrophobic rooms that pretty much sets the standard for seaside hideouts for years to come.  The soliloquy by Laughton at the finale is especially memorable (""...tell your children how the Great Age ended""), but so are all of his scenes. Maybe that's why Hitch reportedly thought the film absurd even before he finished; Laughton steals the movie from him!
Though there is no restored print available anywhere to speak of (the sound on my copy from the 13 film Hitchcock box set has a painful hum throughout it) Jamaica Inn still rules.",1356480000,,1423,4.8838174273858925

As to the film itself, this is not a Great Film, most certainly; it's not even top of the line Hitchcock (which is about as good as it gets), but it is grand entertainment, some fine filming, a knock-out Lady in Distress (the young Maureen O'Hara), Charles Laughton being wonderfully, unabashedly, villainously, satirically, foppishly, Laughtonish, an assortment of  Nasties, including such star actors as Emlyn Williams, and a story-line that Hitchcock keeps suspenseful and vigorously performed. In other words, it is good old fashioned, Saturday night movie house, entertainment. It is a film which will give most viewers, who are not cinematic aesthetes, a bang-up, involving, evening.

I've seen this in two different DVD editions (and peaked briefly into a third) and as far as I can tell none of them are particularly good.  The best that I've seen is the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfred-Hitchcock-Collection-13-Films/dp/B000AARK30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfred Hitchcock Collection - 13 Films</a>, which had a pretty decent picture but absolutely terrible sound.

Alfred Hitchcock would have found the relatively high ratings of what is unquestionably one of his worst films to be perplexing.  Although it has an interesting cast, with Charles Laughton (who drove Hitchcock practically insane with his pouting and bouts of insecurity on the set), the amazingly beautiful Maureen O'Hara (this was NOT her first film, but this film took credit for ""introducing"" her), Leslie Banks, and Robert Newton (one of the most brilliant character actors to grace British films, albeit ostensibly here as the heroic lead).  Hitchcock almost immediately realized that it was a production with no hope and he almost literally slept through the film, putting virtually no effort into the direction.  Part of this was due to the problems on the production, but part of it was due to its being Hitchcock's ""contractual obligation film.""  It was the final film that he needed to make in order to fulfill all his obligations in Great Britain and enable him to depart for the United Stated and Hollywood.

For students of Hitchcock, there is little reason to see this apart from completeness and curiosity.  I've now seen this four times (once at a film festival of his British films, once on VHS, and twice on DVD) and honestly consider it three times too many.  Hitchcock was bored and took absolutely no effort to make it interesting.  The same film could have been made by a director with only a fraction of Hitchcock's talent.

Hitchcock probably made more truly great films than any other director in the history of cinema.  In fact, he made more watchable or interesting films than anyone.  But JAMAICA INN joins a short list of truly awful Hitchcock films, along with things like SECRET AGENT (his film version of the Ashenden short stories by Maugham, not to be confused with his film version of Joseph Conrad's SECRET AGENT, titled SABOTAGE), THE PARADINE CASE, STAGE FRIGHT, TORN CURTAIN, and TOPAZ.  But unless you are determined to see all of Hitchcock's films or want to prove for yourself that this film is as bad as msot critics say, there is no reason to see this.

843063,5,6304337434,"Jamaica Inn of the title is a notorious hovel in Cornwall that in 1815 harbors a ruthless band of cutthroats, who lure ships onto the rocky Cornish coast to shipwreck and plunder them.  Ruthless indeed, as they leave no survivors, killing them in cold blood.  Into this den of horror steps innocent Maureen O'Hara, in her first role, and once she discovers the truth her life is in peril.  Add in a courageous young lawman, the sleazy and quite mad mastermind villain, played to extravagant perfection by Charles Laughton, and you've got a fine and combustible mix of characters.

Then put them all in mortal danger, tighten it up so there's never a moment to lose, and you've got classic Hitchcock doing what he was so rightly famous for.  Easily one of the best movies of its era, its star is dimmed today only by the sadly deteriorated print.  Don't let that stop you, though.  The picture and sound are quite adequate, albeit grainy, and once the ship gets sailing, so to speak, you're on board and on the edge of your seat.  The characters are fully developed, to the point you find yourself hoping against hope that one or another will come out all right, and the villains are effortlessly evil enough that you despise them.  No cardboard cartoon cutouts here.

A fine, fine movie, with acting and directing way ahead of its time.  Special effects, as in ships getting wrecked, are of the day, but in truth are no less unrealistic than a lot of the ham-handed computer animation that abounds currently.

This is a masterful film by the master of suspense, faithfully following a brilliant novel.  Highly recommended.

843064,3,6304337434,"JAMAICA INN is a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and co-produced by Charles Laughton.  Set in 1820s Cornwall, JAMAICA INN is the story about a young Irish orphan, Mary (Maureen O'Hara), who travels to England to live with her last living relative, her aunt Patience (Marie Ney).  Mary soon discovers that Patience's husband, Joss (Leslie Banks), is the leader of a gang that has been leading ships to wreck on the coast, smuggling the goods, and killing any survivors.  Mary seeks help from the local squire, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton), but the squire might not be the friendly neighborhood law enforcer that he presumes to be.

JAMAICA INN was the first movie Hitchcock directed based on a story written by Daphne Du Marier and out of the three it is the weakest.  The plot is rather predictable and much of the acting is overdone.  Apparently there was a great deal of tension on the set between Hitchcock, the director, and Laughton, the co-producer and star of the film.  Hitchcock wasn't given the full control he normally had and was unable to keep Laughton in check.  Still, JAMAICA INN is a Hitchcock film and though it doesn't reach the heights of his greatest films, it's still better than the average film from the period as well as most films made today.

Besides being a Hitchcock movie, JAMAICA INN is notable for several reasons.  To begin with, the movie was one of only a few films in which Hitchcock directed where he did not make a cameo.  It was also his last film that he directed in England before coming to Hollywood under contract to David O. Selanick.  Lastly, the movie marks the big screen debut of Maureen O'Hara.",1187308800,,1658,4.71875
843065,4,6304337434,"These films of the 1930s, 1939 in this case, are amazing. Simple acting, yet still quite inspired by silent movies technique. Very simple setting not cluttered with too many useless props and other decorations. The dialogue is necessarily simple and the voice work is a caricature of dramatic speech. It was all recorded directly when the film was shot on a sound stage most of the time and the microphones were still very primitive. So what could you expect? No integrated music, no sound effects or very poor ones, no visual effects of course with most of the time sedentary cameras. And the lighting was still far from particularly brilliant. And yet these films were magic because they did not even try to look real, realistic. They had to work the way the technique dictated it. Then the rest was compensated and supplemented by the imagination of the audience. And the zippers in the backs of the monsters were not bothering anyone at the time since it was such a marvelous improvement to have the puppets on the screen speak in real voices. It is amazing to see such an old film by Hitchcock. He was already a great director who could get some real gripping action or situations even with all the shortcomings of his equipment. We have to watch them again these old films, these first talkies, to ,be able to appreciate what modern films have to offer but also what we have lost along the way, a lot more than we may think, and particularly the magic of black and white illusion. But we can't be and have been at once, that's obvious. So let us be living in our time and nostalgically revisit the past.

It was the last movie he directed in England before he moved to Hollywood. It was his first screen adaptation of the book by Daphne Du Maurier - his next movie, the Oscar winning ""Rebecca"" is also based on Du Maurier's novel as well as the later ""The Birds"" (1963). ""Jamaica Inn"" introduced 18 years old Maureen O'Hara in her first starring role as Mary, a young orphan girl who arrives to stay with her aunt at the inn located at England's Cornish coast around 1820 to quickly find out that the inn is a headquarters of the of the pirate band. Finally, ""Jamaica Inn"" was the first collaboration of two cinema giants, Alfred Hitchcock and Charles Laughton. While ""Jamaica Inn"" may be not the best or most memorable Hitchcock's film, nobody would argue that Laughton, a performer of an incredible range stole the movie as Sir Humphrey Pengallon in the performance that mixes ""elegant grossness, gallant and sardonic, pure madness, and certain grandeur to his defiance"".",1176940800,,1078,4.832432432432433

Charles Laughton took liberties with this role because he could & over-acted outrageously. Very entertaining as Sir Humphrey Pengallon.

She turns to Sir Humphrey who has befriended her, unaware that he is the ringleader. Good, not great, Hitchcock, but then it is not all his movie.

843164,4,6304337434,"Jamaica Inn (1939) is noteworthy for being Alfred Hitchcock's last British motion picture.  While it does not merit a place among the master's greatest films and lacks your typical Hitchcockian suspense, it's still a perfectly entertaining film that just so happens to introduce Maureen O'Hara to the world.  Charles Laughton steals the show - in more ways than one - and probably antagonized Hitchcock to no end; in fact, one could argue that it is as much Laughton's film as it is the Great Director's.

The story is taken from Daphne Du Maurier's novel of the same name, but the story ultimately deviates significantly from its source material.  The setting is 1820 Cornwall, a coastal town making the most of shipwrecks along its dangerous coastline.  Actually, a group of local ruffians are causing the shipwrecks, luring ships in during storms and then dowsing the light once they approach the coast.  The men then kill any survivors of the wreck and steal everything of value on the ship.  It makes for a pretty lucrative business, that's for sure.  Locals treat the Jamaica Inn, which serves as the headquarters of the ruffians, like it's Dracula's castle, refusing even to stop anywhere near the place.  That is why young Mary (Maureen O'Hara) first encounters Squire Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton) before gracing the doorstep of her new home.  With the loss of her mother, she has come to live at the Jamaica Inn with her Aunt Patience (Marie Ney).  Uncle Joss (Leslie Banks) isn't too high on the idea, but he figures he can handle her unwelcome presence.  Things move much too quickly, in my opinion, as Mary almost immediately discovers Joss' true nature and involves herself in the murderous shenanigans her aunt seems content to ignore.

The film would have been much more effective if the identity of the man running this whole operation had not been revealed to us at the very beginning of the movie.  The premature release of this information robs the film of a great deal of suspense.  You can't pin the blame for this on Hitchcock, however, for that blame falls fully on Charles Laughton.  Yes, Laughton is a hoot to watch in his over-the-top performance as Squire Pengallan, and his insistence that an unknown actress named Maureen O'Hara should land the role of Mary despite her somewhat lackluster audition was definitely a good call, but his drastic story-changing demands (from his position as co-producer) have a discernibly negative impact on how the story plays out.  The film made money, but it was far from a critical success.  For her part, Daphne Du Maurier reportedly hated the film.

No doubt glad to have put this troubled production (which he was never all that excited about to begin with) behind him, Hitchcock was soon on his way to America to adapt another Du Maurier classic, Rebecca, to great acclaim and an Academy Award for Best Picture.",1165708800,,2888,4.8932238193018485

You hit play and the movie begins with the first part of the opening title sequence missing.  It stays in form at the end with a good portion of the end title sequence missing as well.  Other than that the problems aren't too bad.  There are a few momentary jump cuts here and there as well as some signs of wear and age, but for the most part the image is quite nice at times.

He is the 'law of the land"" in his neck of the woods (along the Cornish coast of 19th century England) as local pirates run amok looting wrecked ships cargoes once said ships are induced to wreck themselves into rocks in inclemant weather.  All is going rather well, or so it seems, until Maureen O'Hara (in her first role apparently) shows up at the Jamaica Inn to visit her aunt.  This aunt's husband, however, is the head pirate & the Jamaica Inn is his band's headquarters.  Needless to say, O'Hara's presence complicates matters and eventually jeopardizes the illicit operation going on under the nose of Laughton (who we soon find out is actually getting a sizable cut of the loot actually while feigning ignorance of anything untoward going on in his jurisdiction).  Nevertheless, after Laughton's true colors are exposed---after his participation in numerous murders is highlighted, and even after he forcibly binds & threatens O'Hara---O' Hara delivers this ridiculous line to the police: ""Don't harm him.  It's not his fault.  He can't help himself""---a most hard to believe line considering Laughton's character.  I dare say this is one of the few films of Laughton's wherein he is not particularly fun to watch.

This movie makes me suspect that the young Robert Newton, who plays a soft-spoken good-guy, may have learned from Banks the ferocious glare and menacing body-language he was later to use so effectively playing  murderers like Bill Sikes (OLIVER TWIST) and Long John Silver (TREASURE ISLAND).",947894400,,944,5.414965986394558
843315,3,6304337434,"In Jamaica Inn, Hitchcock did his second costume period piece.  The first was Waltzes From Vienna and the last was Under Capricorn.  Period costume dramas are not Hitchcock's forte.  Since he cannot really connect with the  emotions of the past with the same accuracy that he connects with the  emotions of the present, these films suffer.  Laughton does a great  over-the-top performance and is well worth watching for that fact alone.  Even though Hitchcock did not really click with Maureen O'Hara, she still  gives a good performance.  The film was Hitchcock's last before he left for  America from Britain.  At times the story lags and some of the dialogue is  stilted, but Laughton carries the film and makes it rather entertaining.  Many great camera shots also give Jamaica Inn another reason to check it  out.",947721600,,818,4.955555555555556
843316,5,6304337434,"Charles Laughton really lets himself go, and he's absolutely convincing in his role as Squire Humphery Pengallan, the vain, smug, gluttonous, shifty-eyed, contemptuous, quick-witted murderer who gradually detatches  himself altogether from reality as the law closes in on his schemes.  Loathesome but also lovable, his performance combines the arrogance and  abrupt temper of Captain Bligh (MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY) with the corpulent,  bright-eyed humor typical of Senator Graccus (SPARTICUS), or of Sir Wilfred  Robarts (WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION), with a final descent into total  insanity thrown in for good measure.
Chadwick, his butler, serves as a  wonderful understated straight-man.  Also, some of the minor members of the  wreaking gang provide addional comedy.  Maureen O'Hara screams well but  she's a little too drippy here for my taste.",947635200,,849,5.658730158730159

I have both and find each to be great stories for different reasons. This version plays on any dvd player. The other will only play on Blu Ray as the only format you can get is region free.,1509580800,,305,4.1

7867846,5,6304337434,"This version of du Maurier's wonderful novel stays true to the spirit of the original even though it does deviate in some elements, particularly the ending. All of the performances are strong, and although certain viewers might quibble about the ways in which director and actors have interpreted the characters, they are believable and consistent. There are many outstanding moments in the film where characters bring intense emotion to the scene. The grimness of what is happening on the coast is not glossed over, there are some confronting scenes, and the overall mood of the film is bleak. Despite the ostensibly happy ending, viewers are left with doubts about the future and with the belief that such abhorrent practices will continue. A small victory of humanity over barbarism is the best that the film can offer us. Jamaica Inn is also a meditation on masculinity and femininity, and the constraints upon women, particularly of the working class and the poor. It is a potent social criticism of poverty and injustice, which, while not excusing or extenuating the brutality, shows how violence is inherent in the class system and how a legacy of violence works its way through generations, destroying lives. Powerful and dramatic, and should be enjoyed by du Maurier fans.",1500768000,,1281,5.075829383886256

7867848,2,6304337434,"This was a dark story. Never one minute of happiness. Everyone in the movie was a horrible person except Mary. I wondered how bad was Ned that she would live in scalor and watch ppl be murdered instead of returning to marry her friend Ned. I never saw or understood why she felt anything for Jem although Matt is a handsome actor.

Now the real mystery was why nasty Patience ever agreed to take Mary into this scum bag life or why she was so devoted to her horrible husband. I suppose at the end where they were kissing and talking about an egg he bought her i was supposed to be touched after watching drown him an entire ship full of men. No not feeling it. I did not care one bit for either in fact I could not wait to see thrm dead and some justice served. Both Patience and Joss should hang. They were all scum of the earth.",1487116800,,830,4.1234567901234565

7867852,4,6304337434,"This is hard to rate. Did I LIKE it? No. It's dark. I figured out the identity of the mystery man way too early so there was no big reveal. The characters aren't particularly likable nor are do they show the type of qualities that make them relatable. Three and a half stars is probably a more accurate rating as it was better than just okay, but not quite ""I like it.""

What made it that was that it is not your usual fare. It's grim. I LOVE that area of Cornwall, but I've never seen it look so grey and muddy. They did a really good job of displaying all the main character's hopelessness through the scenery. So, if you are looking for depression and somewhat original, check it out. It might hit the spot.",1478476800,,710,4.220588235294118
