2897878,5,B000TGKW5I,Accurate portrayal of Greek Rembetika with good acting and cast. Musical score was excellent and the settings of the film interesting and realistic.,1375228800,2,148,5.478260869565218
2897879,5,B000TGKW5I,"I know next to nothing about Greek history but I got a lot out of this movie because of its universal tales of misogyny, self-hatred within the entertainer class (singers, dancers, prostitutes), mothers who cannot love their daughters, women who have no choice but to mistrust men, the one good man who cannot get the love he needs from the one woman he loves...  immigration... expectant yet ultimately disappointing return to the homeland...

A lower class girl returning from a long exile yet a stranger within Greece...

This is a timeless story of outsiders within an outsider community, castes within the lowest caste.

Haunting parallels are shown between the Rembetiko music and American blues music....

I agree with some reviewers that the actors and actresses do not age appreciably from their late teens to their 50s.  Someone should have given this talented director money so he could hire a makeup and special effects person who could make the characters age convincingly from all the drug use, drinking and bad nutrition.",1361577600,2,1036,5.064705882352941
2897880,2,B000TGKW5I,"ok, as a musician studying Rembetika, listening to Markos Vamvakaris, I found the movie rather dissapointing.

First, some of the instruments in the movie are not associated with Rembetika of the time: the use a Cumbus, Oud, and Guitar I found unrealistic.  Although in Turkey its concievable the Arabian oud might be played, the cumbus didn't exist till the 50's yet our opening scene has our heroine's mother playing one back in the 30's.  It shows up again, just like all the actors and props.

All the instruments looked pretty good for down-and-out 1930's drug-addicted muscians, especially knowing many players had to build thier own instruments in jail - all very nice and shiny, probaly polyurethane.

That oud player is really long lived, as we see him when she's a little girl, than she's grown with her own child and lo and behold our oud player hasn't aged a day (must be that crazy oud! or all that hash...).

Instruments, actors, and scenerey (props, like the bedroom curtain) re-appear in the movie in later scenes.  The same little girl plays all the little girl rolls.

Is that Elaine from Seinfeld!!!  OMG check out our main character's outfit and hair, its Elaine!

Probably what strikes me the most in this movie is how the actors just stare out into space, you would think with all that hash and pot they would be smiling. I think the director saw some old photographs and mistakenly thought people in the 30's never smiled.

The foreshadowing of her life and her daughters is just cliche, I felt we never get any real sense of the actaul Rembetika scene, maybe I missed where they addressed the banning of Rembetika and Bouzouki music, which is important to the story of the music.  A few songs give us some spicy lyrics, and we get a suppression element, news real footage spliced in to fill the history gaps.

The music playing and singing I thought were good, but obviously lip synced.

Now have some fun: fast forward the movie, its like nothing has changed when you stop.

I have a positive comment: the single breaking plate, a bit surreal, kudos to the director for not having them break every dish in the joint.  oh oh wait, maybe they do later, but later I was fast forwarding and laughing at how this movie is the same set of scenes over and over.

The enemy red-head suicide - ah gee another heartbreaking cliche, nothing compared to the amazing way her mother dies.

Oh and yes we get a tiny bit of un-arrousing nudity, and a fairly convincing Greek bang, but for the most part dissapointing.  Strangely, some of the more surreal scenes stick in my mind, but more as a reminder of how corny this movie was.",1343865600,,2640,4.626609442060086
2897881,3,B000TGKW5I,"I saw Rembetiko two times in the 80ies and was fascinated. The raw power of the story about a famous singer of Rembetiko with its thrilling music haunted me for a long time. Hence  I was very happy to finally find the DVD on Amazon.

So now seeing the movie again (in its original long-version)  I sadly have to admit that it has aged - not to its advantage.

The quality of the DVD transfer is quite poor, the English translation somewhat bad and the movie itself too long. The shorter version - as I remember it - was much more powerful. The acting is cheesy sometimes. Why the singer gets so famous isn't really understandable. The documental material doesn't enlighten you about the political situation.

If it weren't for the wonderful music the movie wouldn't stand a chance. So all in all it's 3 stars. Though still worthwhile watching, it lets you appreciate, that movie-making and story-telling made big progress in the last 27 years.",1298419200,3,943,4.656626506024097

The movie takes the music into an incredible though fictional story of the lives of musicians that fled Smyrna and went to Greece. Though based on real musicains, the story outcome is quite different from truth,. Nonetheless, it is harrowing, and the music is wonderful.

2897885,5,B000TGKW5I,"An oustanding, a real breakthrough film by Costas Ferris: the story of rembetika singer (based on true facts of various artists). Voted Most popular Greek film ever in 2000, Silver Bear Award (Berlin Film Festival); Valencia Film Festival; Alexandria Film Festival etc...

Rembetika (or rebetika) was known in Greece and Minor Asia since last century (perhaps even earlier), but after the exodus of Greeks from Turkey in the 20s, thousands of people had to settle in extreme poverty and under almost non-human conditions... The underworld was born - with pimps, criminals, smugglers,spivs, prostitutes, junkies and drug dealers... That was the music of the underworld created under strong influence of music tradition of Minor Asia and Middle East and, very often, not without influence of hashish. That was a Greek equivalent of urban blues - if I may say so. That was a broken soul and a bleeding heart crying - without any hope and with only wish to forget the misery of existence for an instance.

The soundrack (music by Stavros Xarhakos)is heartbreaking.

Although music is a universal language which usually doesn't need translation, quite often you might need to know the background and understand the words - otherwise you deprive yourselves. That's a must with rembetika.

If you wish to understand better, buy also a book by Elias Petropoulos ""Songs of the Greek underworld: The Rebetika Tradition"" (the best ever written) -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Songs-Of-The-Greek-Underworld-The-Rebetika-Tradition/dp/0863563988/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Songs Of The Greek Underworld: The Rebetika Tradition</a>.
As the film success pushed Costas Ferris into further research of rembetika, he managed to produce a musical show, which toured around the world. Although they didn't perform the real rembetika, the ""updated"" versions were more acceptable for the general (ignorant) audience. So, another CD ""Apopse stou Thoma"" (recorded for Costas Ferris show, and released in 1991 on Astria/Fabelsound in Greece) is highly recommended. Other CDs/DVDs of Ferris show might be available as well.

Regretfully, beyond the borders of Greek-speking community, Costas Ferris is not enough known. It is necessary to mention  that as early as 60s he was already one of the most promising directors of the new wave of Greek cinema, among whose early works there was a documentary (1966) about ""Formynx"" - the first band formed by Vangelis. In 1968, while in exile in France, they've met again, and at that time Ferris was working on totally innovative counter-culture documentary. The one whom he approached to compose film score was Vangelis. Vangelis didn't compose the music, but Ferris wrote the ""screenplay"" (or concept) and the lyrics for the last album of ""Aphrodite's Child"" -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/666-Apocalypse-of-St-John/dp/B000007TVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">666: Apocalypse of St John</a>. Costas Ferris has a very special relation with music - his lyrics are used on the solo album of another member of ""Aphrodite's Child"" - Loucas Sideras, and on the album of Greek cult prog-band - ""Akritas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akritas/dp/B000RGH17C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akritas</a>).

If you have a chance don't miss ""Cafe Aman"" (see the image) which captures the spirit of Ferris live show, and pay special attention to 8 DVDs and 8 CDs set of Costas Ferris documentaries ""The History of Rebetika"" (re-issued in 2009 by Victory - as shown on the image).",1259280000,18,3834,6.064575645756458

8209071,5,B000TGKW5I,"One of the great ironies of the 20th Century was that in the 1920s two musical forms emerged in opposite sides of the globe. Each brand of music had the similar themes and the virtually identical musical structures. One was the Mississippi Delta Blues. The other was Rembetiki music. This movie provides a rare glimpse of the Rembetiki music.

Director Costas Ferris skillfully provides archival footage throughout the film. This footage includes the devastation of the Greek communities in Turkey, in which ethnic Greeks had resided for over two thousand years, but were driven off the Asia Minor coast during Greeces war with Turkey. Hundreds of thousands were killed and the survivors descended to Greece, mainly to Athens.

The story follows the life of Marika, one of the dispossessed, who as a child grew up in an abusive environment. She grows up to be a Rembetissa singer, and we follow her life viewed against the backdrop of the most turbulent events in Europe and Greece, World War II, the German Occupation, liberation, the Greek Civil War, and the Military Junta of the 1960s.

Marika eventually records and sings in the United States. This actually occurred. A Greek dictator, Metaxas, had banned Rembetiki music from public broadcast in the 1930s, and this prohibition lasted into the middle 1970s, after the Military Junta. In the meantime, many Rembetes and Rembetisses were forced to sing and record in the United States because the music had been banned in Greece!

On the up side, the movie features a part of history largely unknown to non-Greeks. There is good acting and skillful use of the archival footage. The archival footage contains English subtitles letting the English viewers know what is being depicted. There is no Greek lettering on these portions of archival footage, only because those scenes are only too well known to the Greek viewer. Some scenes of the movie are filmed in actual locations frequented by Rembetes. For example, there is one scene where Marika and a friend are speaking in a park. That park is the Botaniko in Athens, the subject of a famous Rembetiko song, Enas Mangas sto Botaniko (A Mangas at the Botanical Gardens).

On the down side, this is a sanitized version of the life of the Rembetis. For one thing, in every scene featuring a musical number in a taverna, the taverna is CLEAN! A CLEAN taverna!? Are you kidding?  I was not around at the time, but I seriously doubt that the numerous tavernes and stekis and tekes frequented by Rembetes and Manges were clean and tidy as depicted in the movie. Most were smoke-filled (from tobacco and otherwise) hovels. When the movie begins with the explanation that the Rembetes lived on the fringes of society, this is no joke. The Rembetes, and Manges who listened to their music, lived in a world inundated with drugs, crime, criminals, low-life, and prostitutes. One very famous Rembetiko song is all about waiting for the boat to arrive, at night, with the Persiko, the slang word for Hashish.  It was a violent, cruel existence, reflected in Marikas childhood, and reflected in their songs. Another very famous Rembetiko song is Stou Botanikou o Mangas, telling the story of a Mangas who was found dead at the Botanical Gardens. The Rembetes were dispossessed person thrown into a foreign country in which their only connection was a similar language and which could not or would not integrate them into society.

Further, the movie tends to reduce the lifestyle of the Rembetis to caricature. Marikas father is sloven, unshaven, constantly drunk or with a hangover. The real-life reference no doubt is a song by Tsitsanis, Yiati me ksipnis to proi, mesa ston upnon to bari? (Why do you wake me up in the morning while Im in a deep sleep?) Slick, mustached, Manges, in their daper suits and polished shoes. Sometimes it seems the only authentic characters in the movie are the main actors.

In the final analysis, this movie is a celebration of Rembetiki music, drenched in the pain, sorrow and joy of the life of dispossessed people from Turkey. The movie very effectively conveys the power and mystique of this once- forbidden music.",1427932800,4,4144,4.900142653352354

However, this was a video from 1920 - Greek poverty = prostitution....unfit for my grandchildren to even see this video...I thought by the limited advertisement that it was Greek dancing instructions.  I returned both videos....one was for myself - the other for the people who thought this was Greek dance instruction....  Look at the front of this video = musicians and dancers.
