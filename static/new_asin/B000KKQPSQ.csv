2693232,4,B000KKQPSQ,"Sleep My Love is a movie that many wish would be available in the USA, I had read some reviews & I rolled the dice & bought the import. The print for the most part is very good. You won't be able to play this on a R1 player as it clearly says PAL format in the description. The seller that I bought this from sells import DVDs and lists as such.
The film is a very well done Noir/thriller chiller in a plot that basically is ' man wants to dump wife by driving her mad and replace her with a hot babe '
Claudette Colbert was great as the accursed wife that is being drugged and told to things in her sleep to start her downfall. Robert Cummings was also great as the concerned friend who finds out what is going on.
There are some creepy tense scenes as well as a little tongue in cheek humor thrown into the mix. The cast is great not just the stars but in small roles we have Raymond Burr, Key Luke , Ralph Morgan around in this.
On a personal note the 'hot babe' Don Ameche is looking to start a life with had such a lousy brat-like personality that I wonder what he saw in her besides her looks. She was a great example of beauty being only skin deep. It was a great role and kept wondering if he would have been better off having an affair with a woman of substance.
It kind of reminded me a movie called Diabolique (a french noir) actually. Some compare it to Gaslight as well..
Don't expect an all time classic but at the same time , to me it was a good, solid picture & worth owning..for others that are on the fence, rent it first..it is worth checking out..especially if you like classic Noir films
Only get the DVD if you have the equipment to play it as it is an import.",1256688000,8,1682,4.054054054054054
2693233,3,B000KKQPSQ,"This was Sirk's fifth studio picture film after his 1939 Hollywood arrival from Europe. The first five minutes or so on the train have an attention-grabbing, sub-Hitchcock quality that is nonetheless effective.  ""Sleep, my Love"" prefigures some of the director's most familiar themes ('blindness'/'not seeing' in the form of the heroine's obliviousness to the true circumstances of her marriage and in the device of the photographer's glasses; the use of photography as a plot element; the prevalence of mirrors and glass; the director's satirical approach to the presentation of Claudette Colbert's social set; and the ambivalence and ambiguity that are key to Colbert's character and overall situation). Supporting performances are amusing (particularly  those of Robert Cummings as a playboy who is smarter than he likes to let on and the sultry nastiness of a gold-digging femme fatale as played by Hazel Brooks in sheer negliges). George Coulouris, Rita Johnson and Queenie Smith are all wonderfully entertaining, while Don Ameche's part is thankless and  routinely acted. For die-hard Sirk fans only.",1231718400,3,1106,5.4941176470588236

The actors really fit the roles very well.  Even the minor parts.  I like old black and white movies, that are not about gangsters.  Of course this is a take off of Gaslight with Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman, just not as creepy.  I like the romantic bits with Claudette Colbert and Robert Cummings.

2693241,5,B000KKQPSQ,"I've been watching black and whites all this week and by far this is my favorite.  These old films are short and sweet and bring the action in a few short scenes.  Filmmakers of this day should take note, no foul language or nudity but enough suspense and humor to keep one entertained.  I have not seen Gaslight so the comparison will be the other way around, if I get to see it.  I cannot compare but watching this film was a real treat, to see Ameche as the villain.  The love interest, Daphne, was a bit harsh but expected when one is out for blood. I enjoyed the slick calm way the actors played their parts.  Colbert, the beautiful but confused wife, not willing to believe foul play of her husband.  Cummings was funny, caring and chivalrous. I felt anxious to see just who would do what next and that gave me a memory of watching  the old Charlie Chan movies.  The plot may not be altogether there but that is what the imagination is for, to fill in the blanks and it is still worth watching, .  FDJALMY",1444867200,,1011,4.273684210526316

2693271,4,B000KKQPSQ,"Im not a huge fan of film noir, but I really did like Sleep My Love.  Watching this film, especially with Robert Cummings in it, reminded me of Dial M for Murder.  Both movies were suspenseful and had an excellent cast of characters.  I really liked Robert Cummings as Bruce.  I've always felt he was underrated as a dramatic actor. I was surprised to see Don Ameche playing a villain and I felt his performance was a little stiff. Claudette Colbert gave a fine performance but I felt she was a little too matronly for the part.  I did like the addition of Key Luke as Bruce's Chinese brother.",1393891200,4,593,4.4036697247706424
2693272,4,B000KKQPSQ,"This movie is very watchable with an excellent opening of a confused Claudette Colbert. Yes, it does have a whiff of ""Gaslight"" but, it is different enough to keep your attention. Colbert is a wealthy woman with a philandering husband who wants her dead and wants her money. Drugs, psychological manipulation, guns and sexy women all work together to make this story interesting. A really nice element, for the time, is the hero having a Chinese American best friend who is also a WWII hero, as well. There is even a Chinese wedding that has traditional elements but, is also modern with Chinese Americans portrayed as modern and not caricatures. The bride of the heroes ""brother"" is sexy and with it. A great change of pace from the usual ""servant"" depictions of Asians at this point in time. Colbert is excellent and lovely. Those cheek bones must have been made of granite. A nice change of pace for Amici. All of the movies that I have previously seen of him for this time period have him as a breezy guy about town comedienne. He is the villain in this. A vile and greedy man. All in all, a very good, entertaining movie with a very solid cast and a good storyline.",1391212800,2,1170,4.549763033175355

2693281,4,B000KKQPSQ,"Daphne Swann was a piece of work, a piece of work alright. She could have a man, men actually, wrapped around her tiny finger, wrapped around tight and make them like it. Make them think it was natural. And she had all the equipment for the work, long dark hair, brown eyes, big ruby red lips, and a models figure, not a high fashion models figure, they were too skinny she said, but a department store models, something a man could hold onto, and hold onto dreams about. She said give her a few nights with a man, or rather a man with her, and he would do anything she asked, anything. Sometimes like with her boss, Four-eyes (real name Bruce Lang but with those bi-focals nothing else seemed to fit), she didn't even have to spent the night, she could piece him off with a couple of, uh, provocative photos of her to sell to discerning customers and that was all he needed to be her lap dog. See she worked for Bruce as, uh, model and assistant in his photography shop and that was how she met Mister Abbott. Mister Abbott, a real catch, a meal ticket out of sleazy photos, men pawing modeling and the whole cheap Four-eyes gaff.

Mister Abbott had come into the shop one afternoon looking to have a photograph taken for a passport. While he was waiting he had spied Daphne going about in  a revealing swim suit after a shoot and struck up a conversation. (Little did he know that Daphne had eyed him, eyed him as a catch, as simple bait, as he entered the door and put had on her fangs.) That conversation led to a swanky dinner led to an uptown hotel bedroom and a few days later one Mister William Abbott was hooked, hooked bad, hooked as bad as a man could be about a woman. He would do anything she asked, anything.
Bill Abbot, it turned out, was from a branch of the famous Abbotts that worked their wills in Wall Street and peopled the upscale Sutton Place apartments of New York City. And married other Mayfair swells like the Penningtons. See Bill was from what he described as the declining gentry, the poor relatives Abbotts, who nevertheless were pedigreed enough to make marriages with the families with real dough. Families like the Elliott Penningtons, one of whose daughters, Cora, Bill had married. But she had control of all the dough, all the dough until she died and that was that. Bill would have to wait it out. Well, not quite because Daphne dreamed, dreamed night and day about getting out from under cheap street and she didn't particularly care how she got out. So when she presented her plan, her ultimatum plan to Bill he didn't think twice about refusing, especially since it seemed so fool-proof.

And it was to a point. See guys like Bill Abbott, and even a woman like Daphne draw back at old-fashion murder, draw back at taking the big step-off at Ossining and places like that where they would not be able to enjoy earthly goods, So Daphnes idea was to get the high- strung Cora to kill herself, aided by an unrelenting program directed by Bill to lead her along that path. Then a quick jump off a building or something like that and easy street. Bill loved the idea, and moved to implement it as quickly as possible. He had real skill at making Cora doubt her sanity. When Bill told Daphne each detail over pillows she practically salivated.
Of course one virtue of old-fashioned murder is that it gets done, and is then done. Finished.  This murder cum suicide is trickier. It requires a willing subject and good luck. And that is just what Bill and Daphne did not have in the end. They were doing just fine until Chad, a brother of a classmate of Coras at Miss Prissys, or something like that, boarding school, came down from Boston and started to gum up the works. He was smitten with Cora and thus parried, first unknowingly, then knowingly, each psychological blow Bill threw at her. It got so bad that Bill and Daphne decided to try some other more direct way, like an ambush. That didn't work, didn't work at all as Bill became a victim of his own over-cleverness and was shot, shot dead, in self-defense (or that would be the way it would work out in front of a jury) by Cora directing the fire his way at Chads command. Poor Daphne will spend many a cold night thinking through  what might have been, a place on Sutton and everything.",1362009600,,4279,4.445859872611465
2693282,3,B000KKQPSQ,"Anyone who is familiar with ""Gaslight"" will come into ""Sleep, My Love"" already informed as to what is going on, but even so, the film is a well-made entry in the ""Let's-Drive-the-Rich-Wife-Nuts"" subgenre.  Claudette Colbert plays a middle-aged socialite with a lounge-lizard husband, who starts experiencing strange blackouts, including one in which she allegedly shoots hubby.  She is also haunted by a weird man in coke-bottle glasses.  All of it is a plot, of course (I'm not really giving anything away that won't be obvious fifteen minutes into the movie), but the question is, will savior Robert Cummings be able to rescue Colbert before she's offed, or not?  Colbert contributes a star turn, and Don Ameche plays the lizard husband in understated, oily fashion, and he's quite good. Cummings demonstrates that he was perhaps too subtle and natural for his time to be considered a really fine actor, which he actually was.  Hazel Brooks paints the femme fatale with a heavy--almost laughably so--brush, but offsetting that is a nice turn by Raymond Burr as a policeman.  Burr at this time was a film noir staple, usually on the darker side of the law, so it's nice to see him play an affable good guy.  Directed with broad strokes by Douglas Sirk (and produced by Mary Pickford!), this is by no means a great film, but it's entertaining, and well-shot, and shows that Ameche possessed more skill as an actor than he was usually given credit for at this point in time.",1325980800,4,1473,4.844621513944223

While the story eventually escapes the bounds of credibility, it holds together much longer that it seems it should have - and even when it gets away, it's a quick sprint to the end so it doesn't diminish the movie much.
