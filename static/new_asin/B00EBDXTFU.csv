5901150,5,B00EBDXTFU,"This is a great example of pure early 80's cheese- not terribly horrific, not terribly well-acted in places, but boy, it's a lot of fun. My kids weren't impressed, which saddened me somewhat, but I'm very, very happy to have this on disc. (The musical numbers made them laugh pretty hard, though! Gotta love that late-70's to early 80's style!) If you're a fan of Vincent Price, when he lays it on thick and with unrelenting humour, grab this movie- it's solid gold CHEEZE! :D",1394064000,,476,4.6117647058823525
5901151,1,B00EBDXTFU,"There's a reason The Monster Club didn't get a U.S. release back in 1980, and it had nothing to do with Halloween or Friday the 13th: it just wasn't any good. Tired, familiar scripting, flaccid direction, some mighty bored performers, and a cheapjack production spells the end of U.K. horror in The Monster Club. A rental for horror completists only...but everyone else has been warned.",1393459200,,386,4.953846153846154
5901152,3,B00EBDXTFU,this movie is not his best effort but historically signifigant cuz it was his last.  the bonus price interview is well worth the price of admission,1392681600,,147,4.653846153846154
5901153,4,B00EBDXTFU,"I remember watching this when I was a kid, on TV.. the story of the HuGoo always stuck in my mind, expecially when I drive into a fog bank",1387929600,,138,3.793103448275862
5901154,5,B00EBDXTFU,"for years I have been searching for this film and now I finally have it. For those who are fans of Vincent Price movies, this is one for the collections.",1382572800,,153,4.133333333333334
8603545,5,B00EBDXTFU,"Another lost gem! It's the way horror movies should be made! Great story telling and acting with humor and little graphic
blood and gore. Price is a horror writer who gets bite by a vampire Carradine who brings him to The MOnster Club and
gives him a history lesson in monsters and tales of terror. The stories are so good and fun to watch. If you like Thrillers
and Suspense you'll love this movie. This was made in 80''s when new wave and punk was starting to get popular
so there is music in the MOnster Club but it's actually pretty good and doesn't ruin the movie. A must have for Price fans.",1509321600,,597,4.292035398230088

8603549,4,B00EBDXTFU,If you are looking for a Vincent price movie this is not the one for you.  It is a anthology of short stories introduced by Vincent.  That being said though.  It is still a good watch.  I love the very idea of the monster club.,1435968000,,227,3.977777777777778
8603550,5,B00EBDXTFU,"This scared me when it first came out. I've taken it to horror film marathons and it creeps out the friends. I got my second copy when a friend ""lost"" the first. I know what's coming and it still creeps me out. Fog? Small villages? The guy who lives alone? I don't trust ANY of it anymore! Good watch.",1435795200,,301,4.11864406779661
8603551,4,B00EBDXTFU,It was exactly how I remembered it and the port over from vhs to dvd was in good quality.,1404345600,,89,3.736842105263158
8603552,4,B00EBDXTFU,"The movie was great quality, and very enjoyable! The music was super catchy as well. Overall, this was a great buy.",1401408000,,115,4.523809523809524
8603553,3,B00EBDXTFU,"The movie is a three part anthology type. First story is atmospheric but ends rather stupidly with a whistling monster. Really, a monster that whistles? The middle story is a very tongue in cheek vampire tale that's supposed to be comedic. It's not particularly funny though. The last story is the scariest, as it does have a couple of gotcha type moments. Unlike some other reviewers here, I didn't think the acting in the final story was over the top. The main character, who is a movie director, did an excellent job. Who really cares about the extras? I was rooting for him to escape the ghoul town but .... we know how that's gonna turn out. Anyway, Vincent Price and the old writer who sort of MC this anthology do a good job of introducing the stories. The best song is definitely the stripper song as it really rocks and the female singer has a very good voice that gets your attention. I might add that she also gets the attention of a certain male appendage. So overall, it is campy fun and a little bit of everything thrown in. Not a great movie but okay to watch on a rainy day.

Now for the bad: the disc freezes at exactly 46:51, right in the middle of the second story. I sent back the disc and got a replacement, thinking I got a bad disc. The replacement also freezes right at the same point! Unbelievable.... so I was unable to watch about two minutes of the movie where this happens. Have to reverse back to a scene just after the trouble spot and pick up the action from there. It appears to be a manufacturing defect that is present on every one of these discs by this manufacturer. After going through the hassle of mailing back the first disc to amazon, it's not worth the effort of sending back the second disc. I'm just going to keep it, defect and all.",1399939200,,1778,4.355421686746988
8603554,3,B00EBDXTFU,"I'm not a big fan of anthology films, but the appearances of film greats like Vincent Price, Donald Pleasence, John Carradine, Stuart Whitman and Patrick Magee makes this film worth a watch for any horror fan. While not a gory or bloody film by 80's standards, it is one of the last times to see all these grearts in one film. It's played mostly for comedy effect, but it is one of the few anthology films that I can watch more than once. Scorpion Releasing does its usual bang-up job of offering the film in a clean version in its original aspect ratio.",1396137600,,554,4.388349514563107
