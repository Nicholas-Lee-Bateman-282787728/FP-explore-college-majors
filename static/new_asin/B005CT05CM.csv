8465857,3,B005CT05CM,"I bought this film, thinking I would get the version I saw originally when I was travelling around Europe. It was a horrifying Italian style 'giallo' crime drama which was extremely violent but, nevertheless, quit gripping. Joe Dallesandro, a Warhol discovery, was quite good. You really hated him at the end of the film for all the horrible things his character did out of boredom. Some of the scenes were so brutal that you were really excited to see the 'bad guys' get their just deserts in the end. In Dallesandros bio, the writer stated that he really wasn't pleaaed with the film. He said: here he was working with a director who thought he was filming the next academy award winning film, and Joe was angry about the directors calls for 'motivation'. Joe said :What motivation...I am chasing down a women with a forklift!
Well, have no fear. About 10 minutes have been cut from this DVD reissue, including the 'forklift' scene. The shock effect of the original is non-existant since most of the 'shock' has been edited out! And besides, since it isn't region 1 playable, you have to get it transfered so you can view it here. Hopefully the orignal version will be issued one day. Oh yes, I forgot, its in Italian only,with no subtitles and no bonuses!",1367280000,,1258,4.671171171171171
