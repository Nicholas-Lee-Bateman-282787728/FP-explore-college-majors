8569928,5,B00BKBCDOE,This series was really entertaining and fun to watch. I loved all the characters and seeing how their personalities developed throughout the series.,1466121600,,148,5.478260869565218
8569929,5,B00BKBCDOE,"I'm not a believer in review the content of anime or movies in amazon reviews because the majority of interest is probably in the product itself. That being said, the DVD collection for Tari Tari so simple and straight-forward, there's not much to say about it. It does the job well and the price is very reasonable. I actually appreciate the fact that the DVD release has no English Dub as I'd rather it stay in its original language anyways. It's nice to see some lesser popular shows being sold in North America without being tainted by a dub rewrite. This is your basic DVD for fans of Tari Tari who want to show their support by owning this fantastic series! there's not much extra included in the DVD, but that shouldn't matter to a collector.",1443484800,,749,4.514705882352941

8569931,3,B00BKBCDOE,"All in all a fine show, but the copy I got had one problem: the subtitles on the first disk got out of synch 3/4s of the way through the fourth episode.  It seems that a subtitle was skipped, and worse, every subtitle after that was played when the prior subtitle was supposed to, to the wrong words were shown when anyone spoke.  This of course destroyed immersion and made it difficult to follow what was being said.  This continued all the way through the end credits and next episode preview - thank goodness it was the last episode on the disk!  I am curious if other people purchasing the show had the same problem I did.

Beyond that, this was, as noted, a fine show.  As the title, 'Tari Tari' ('This and That') indicates, it's a show about various experiences a group of five teenagers go through during their last year of high school.  This translates to them each having to deal with a personal problem or insecurity, some of which are rather significant and span multiple episodes.  (And one or two of which aren't and don't.  Hey, some people are just lucky.)  The show does not pretend that all problems have easy answers, and at times the kids have to come away from it learning to deal with failure and personal loss.  At times the show can become quite moving, though of course it does manage to close on a triumphant, happy note.

Oh, and also there's a lot of singing.  This you might have expected me to mention that first, since the singing club is the stated premise of the show, but in practice it doesn't seem as important as you might think.  As often as not, the club is incidental to the problems and issues at hand, though it does always come back to prominence eventually.

As for the singing itself, I'm not really qualified to comment on its variety or quality; it was, of course, basically all choral music, or more precisely that of a small vocal group.  The voices themselves all seemed reasonably well sung, in my uneducated opinion; it also should be noted that the disks include no dub track, so there is no alternate set of voices to compare to and the potential problem of translated/undubbed songs never arises.  It also of course means that this is not for people who hate subtitles.

Extras are present and slightly more than the usual; in addition to trailers and creditless opening/closings, various Japanese commercials are included as well.  A nice touch but nothing too exciting.

So yeah - a pretty good drama, with occasional comedic elements.  There are few or no 'wild takes', and no super deformity or other comedic staples.  This is your straightforward 'coming of age'-type teen drama.  With singing.  Lots and lots of singing.",1379894400,3,2681,4.619450317124736
8569932,5,B00BKBCDOE,"Is the story of 3 girl and 2 boys who are getting ready for graduation in a few years and you see them make their own club...

8569933,4,B00BKBCDOE,"Very charming, great animation, good acting by the Japanese actors, and an interesting plot.

It's a comedy-drama, though the comedy is not laugh-out-loud funny (it isn't meant to be), the drama is good without becoming soapy melodrama. The characters are all well- defined, and while some (the vice principle in particular) seem like stereotypes at first, they are given development throughout the series and their actions are defined by clear motivations.

In general, if you want a charming and well-made slice of life anime, Tari Tari is a great choice. I highly recommend it.",1366416000,8,580,5.159574468085107
8569934,4,B00BKBCDOE,"Konatsu Miyamoto is told she won't be allowed to sing in the chorus club because she lacks ""something special"" as her teacher says. But Konatsu wants to sing. So she quits the chorus club. And starts her own club. Some of members of her new club are rather forcibly recruited, but soon they all become friends and find that singing together is something they all enjoy.

I wasn't going to watch this show, based on the lackluster premise and the character designs. I thought it was yet another cutesy high school club story and wasn't interested. Well, it is a cutesy high school club series. But it is also something more. Genuinely heartwarming. It is a story about friendship and chasing your dreams. It is the tale of a girl recovering from the death of her mother. The story of a boy learning to live in a foreign country. A girl whose dream might be out of reach because she is too tall. A boy whose devotion to a game represents something more. And a girl who wants to sing.

Tari Tari is 13 episodes long and based on a manga that is currently only 1 volume long (not sure if it is still being released or not). The story has a satisfying ending, so I doubt there will be a second season.",1362700800,14,1196,4.358744394618834
