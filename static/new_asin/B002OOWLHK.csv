8376313,5,B002OOWLHK,"I have been watching my Comedy Gold recordings of ONE DAY AT A TIME the past few months, and if Sony and Shout Factory won't release the remainder of the series on DVD, I think Amazon should at least make it available for streaming for those who want to revisit Ms. Romano, Schneider and Co.

What surprised me the most about Season 7 is how well the show re-established itself in this later era. IMO Season 5 was a mess with writers scrambling to find focus after MacKenzie Phillips was fired due to her drug problem. Season 6 they were still trying new ideas and working out the kinks, but here is where the show begins firing on all cylinders once more.

Alex (Glenn Scarpelli) moves in permanently after his father Nick (Ron Rifkin) is killed in a car accident and Ann agrees to assume responsibility so the boy can remain in Indianapolis. This new dynamic works because it affords Schneider the opportunity to be a father figure (the episode MRS. OLEARYS KIDS where Alex accidentally sets fire to Schneiders beloved camper is a series classic), and presents Ann with a fresh and unfamiliar set of challenges when it comes to child-rearing. In a stroke of genius, the writers bring back Francine (Shelley Fabares) as Anns new business partner and the catty banter between the two makes for some deliciously wicked barbs that will bolster these later seasons. Julie (Mackenzie Phillips) and Max (Michael Lembeck) return for a November Sweeps two-parter, bringing with them the usual marital drama and Phillips looks positively radiant and healthy in stark contrast to how we saw her last in Season 5. But it is Barbara (Valerie Bertinelli) who shows the most growth this season as she meets dental student Mark Royer (Boyd Gaines) in a relationship that starts off rocky but blossoms into an engagement that may be sabotaged when Barb learns she is unable to conceive a child (in an Emmy winning episode BARBARAS CRISIS). Nanette Fabray is on-hand for a bunch of episodes as the flighty Grandma Romano and she dabbles in everything from tarot-card reading, to an affair with Francines con-man father.

I was surprised at just how well these episodes hold up, since I haven't seen any of them since they originally aired on CBS Sunday back in 1981-82. Hopefully they will become available for public consumption again, other than the edited shows being run currently on Antenna TV in the US.",1468713600,,2393,4.803398058252427
