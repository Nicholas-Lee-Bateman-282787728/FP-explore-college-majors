8148788,4,B000J2G3PU,"This is brief summary of  ""Classic Fables Films Children's Stories"".

I bought this disk for the various Ray Harryhausen (RH) sequences.  These include the 4 shorts in the RH Mother Goose series (Little Miss Muffet, Old Mother Hubbard, The Queen of Hearts, and Humpty Dumpty).

I found the video and audio quality of this disk to be a little better than  ""Fairy Tales Favorites""  which I also own; and it contains many of the same RH stories.

The RH stories are captivating:  my 3 year old, my 7 year old, and I all enjoyed them.  If you haven't seen these, you should get this disk.  Although other disks, of lesser quality, have more RH material.",1374969600,,649,4.565217391304348
