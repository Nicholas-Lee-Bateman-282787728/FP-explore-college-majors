To me, that would reference something like ""earth,"" where you see killer whales playing beach ball with a baby seal, or drowning a baby gray whale (and Disney made that one). The only thing I could think of that might qualify as brutal is a loon pecking at a baby polar bear to make it go away. My sister gave this on VHS to my daughters ten years ago when they were 5 and 7. They loved it, and believe me, they were big animal activists! They still quote it to this day, which is why we got on to find it on DVD! My husband works in conservation, and we were still able to just enjoy some simple, silly entertainment. Unless they have added things to the DVD that weren't on the VHS, if you still have a little of the funny bone you had when you were a kid, you AND your kids will have fun watching this one!",1314921600,,902,4.073033707865169
