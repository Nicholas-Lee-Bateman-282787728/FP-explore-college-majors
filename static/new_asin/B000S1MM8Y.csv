2878794,5,B000S1MM8Y,I was very pleased with how fast I received this product.  The shipping was great. I love YBB so any DVD they put out I have to have. I don't do the tapes as often as I should but when I do them I definately notice a difference in my body.,1209513600,,239,3.6862745098039214
2878795,4,B000S1MM8Y,"They've really nailed it ... best exercise program I've ever tried (if you count years of modern dance, Pilates, yoga, aerobics, jazzercise, Tae-bo, Lotte Berke, etc.).  Although the blond is a bit gamey sometimes, after you finish one of their workouts you feel great: integrated, serene, and accomplished. I'd recommend starting with the basic program before entering this Master series, but then, all bets are off. Enjoy!",1198108800,4,424,5.3283582089552235
2878796,5,B000S1MM8Y,"AM LATTE:
Great way to wake up or energize during the day when feeling sluggish..
This is set with just Teigh & Gillian alone which I like best. Their great energy & body awareness isn't distracted by other student's energy that is usually lower and don't want to exercise as much.
Intro 2 min - 1 min commercial & 1 min intro
First 10 min
Laying down 3 min - tensing/releasing one body part at a time from toes to head, then several body parts to help wake up your body.
Sitting - yoga pose lion (which helps increase energy & facial beauty) about 3x. Next is while still sitting on your heels, the spinal flexibility kundalini pose of flexing/extending your spine w/breath to increase energy for 2 min (def good cardio workout). For rest is a mudra hand positions & mantra to balance out your left & right side of your body, and a quick wake up of lightly patting all over your body to wake up the skin & refresh for 2 min. Last is a mudra of thinking of what you want while you hold up your hands (good arm strengthener.)
Standing 17 min
Cardio - 10 min - simple fast steps & rolling hands, steps with opening up of the hip, bring arms up, pulling elbows back, flicking wrist, walking & light cute kicks, etc. all very simple & easy moves to help get your circulation going throughout your body w/o being hard so you want to move even more. Ends in simple plies.
Ballet - 4 min - Side leg lifts with arms in 3 diff ballet positions on each side, done 2 times, stretching for 1 min their signature glut stretch of one foot resting on the other & dipping down, then plies & balancing on tip toes for 1 min.
Stretching/End - 5 min
Yoga - 3 min - sun salutations, but very slowly for those new at yoga, very slow mountain, then back forth with standing fwd bends, then on to plank, upward dog & downward dog only a few times & then child's pose
Ending mudras - sitting simple cross legged and doing 2 mudras for trusting yourself and another
They did a great job for slowly helping when you feel sluggish to go w/o feeling overwhelmed. Teigh & Gillian were sweating nicely from the leg lifts, it's great when they allow that realism instead of always doing makeup touch ups so you feel alone that you feel bad that you are tired.
You can actually see a clip of the cardio section on youtube for this from TotalFitnessDVDs com

GODDESS ABDOMINALS
Only 20 min including the 3 min for intro & mudra
It starts with sitting normal on the floor & stretching w/squishy ball but you don't need one, the turning the waist stretching & other mind stretching & movements to warm you up. Next lying down is legs crossed at ankles legs toward chest lifts, different types of crunches with arms or legs or both, 1 arm/shoulder lifts to do obliques, locust for abs, bridge, straight leg drops instead of lifts, and other similar ab work, nothing major, they are quite careful with those who may have limited flexibility. Ends with some good lying spinal twist.
What makes them great is the affirmations & once you get past the mudra at the beginning, they move so fast, it doesn't even feel like 15 min before it's over.
Like all the other yoga booty ballets, they really get me excited to pop in the disk to want to work out more since I am in decent shape. For those in great shape, it's also good as a warm up or a very light day. For those out of shape, its a fun workout.
I love Gillian & Teighs wonderful positive energy & affirmations.",1190419200,30,3426,4.328149300155521
8203919,4,B000S1MM8Y,"There are two DVDs in this set, A.M. Latte and Goddess Abs.

First, A.M. Latte. I had no idea what to expect.  Well, it IS a great DVD to do if you just woke up and want to get in some exercise, but you're still stiff and sleepy.  I really like this compared to the YBB ""Lives"" since it takes me forever to learn choreography. The choreography in this is simple to understand and do.  It starts off in easy sitting pose with some kundalini inspired yoga (a kriya, a mudra and an intention) before getting you onto your feet.  You do end with some yoga at the end.

As for Goddess Abs, get ready to work your core for 20 minutes!  Wow...it's challenging.  They do use a squishy ball. I used one from a pilates kit I have, and it was fine. They have some innovative moves I've not seen.  It incorporates some kundalini inspired yoga.

The set for both DVDs looks like a yoga studio with hardwood floors, frosted windows, nice lights, plants, and fabrics. The set is nice. The music is good.  The instructors are positive and life affirming, as in all the YBB DVDs.

I'm slowly collecting all the YBBs and am finding that each one has its own personality.  It's a great program to use when you're low on energy, new to exercise, returning to exercise from an injury, or needing something light to keep you moving and grooving through winter with its cold days and dark nights.  They are fun, positive and cheerful.",1390003200,,1411,4.397683397683398
8203920,3,B000S1MM8Y,"I recently tried the Yoga Booty Ballet, Booty & Core dvd and really like it, so I thought I'd give this one a try.  This one was not quite as appealing to me.  Here are the pros/cons:

I liked the start of tensing and relaxing muscles and setting a tone for your practice, but the A.M. Latte section that includes more dance moves to get you going weren't too exciting and felt a little silly, as did the lion face you do in the warm-up with your eyes rolled back and your tongue out....just not my thing.  I finished the A.M. latte, which took about 20 minutes and felt that it was a very mild workout-really just getting the muscles and joints moving, not a sweaty kind of thing.  The Abs section I really liked.  Lots of moves for your abs that seem to come from basic pilates moves.  The one thing I did not realize was that they would use a ball for these exercises.  They are easily modified without one, but I thought that somewhere it should have noted that a ball was optional and then maybe show the ball version and then the version without.

I borrowed this dvd, so I would say it isn't challenging enough for me to request it again, and it would not be one that I would purchase, but if you want a light workout and a good core program this may be for you if you are a beginner/intermediate exerciser.",1302652800,2,1314,4.244979919678715
8203921,3,B000S1MM8Y,It was a little weird and not as good as a workout as I like.,1271980800,,61,3.1333333333333333
8203922,1,B000S1MM8Y,"There is something really off putting about this series.  I love pilates and yoga videos, but couldn't get through 5 minutes of this due to the cheese factor; YUCK!",1258416000,,164,4.655172413793103
8203923,5,B000S1MM8Y,"This is my favorite DVD set.  Relatively easy to follow and at the same time a very intense workout which burns and sculpts abs and the AM Latte is a great for overall conditioning and leg sculpting.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1250380800,,222,4.666666666666667
8203924,5,B000S1MM8Y,This is a snappy work out that keeps your interest. it's fun and i enjoy it.,1247788800,,76,3.8125
8203925,5,B000S1MM8Y,"Teigh and Gillian do it again! AM Latte is a great way to start the day, and really engerize yourself for the day ahead. You first start off with laying down squeezing the body all over and then do lions pose fallowed by streatcing out the spine with inhales exhales. Then you do a mudra for infity , life , death and rebirth. Then the cario workout begins with some engerizing dance moves fallowed by some booty ballet to strengthen and tone the legs and glutes. After words you do a few minutes of sun salutions, down ward dog, planks ,and upward dog. Fallowed by one last mudra of holding in the breath and looking lazer like at your thumbs. This workout lasts for a total 37 minutes. I have been using this workout for the last 2 weeks as a start for my day ,and I feel reengerized everyday still. You will sweat with this workout too(or you should if you do the best you can at high intesity)

Goddess Abs is only 24 minutes but believe it or not your abs are gonna be sore the next day! (Again if you worked out the best you can)You will need a squishy ball for this workout. You start off with mudras that work your spin and core. Then you do a seris of crunches and pilates ab work. It will make your abs vibrate if done correctly. You end this tape with some abdominal stretchs and mudra. Like I said before you will be sore in the abs for a bit or possibly the next day which is good because it means you worked it ! I promise you that you should see results with this dvd if your not seeing results than your probably not working at a very hard intesity.

Yoga Booty Ballet is a great program, and really does give you the dancer's figure with contiually use. I have been doing AM Latte, YBB cardio/sclupt dvds and then end the night with pajamia time Dvds. Teigh and Gillian really inspire you to do your best. Read my other reviews on ybb if your instrested!",1246838400,4,1871,4.223463687150838
8203926,5,B000S1MM8Y,I don't generally like excercise routines or look forward to excercising...but I LOVE the YBB workouts.  They make me forget that I am working out and I actually look forward to the routines.,1240617600,,191,4.787878787878788
8203927,5,B000S1MM8Y,"this is a good workout, don't have to keep paying an instructor to go to their classes, if you have the space to move around a bit it is even fun!  I highly recommend this cd.",1238716800,,175,3.861111111111111
8203928,5,B000S1MM8Y,"they hit the nail on the head again with this one. i don't think it is possible for teigh and gillian to create a ""bad: workout. its energizing, motivating, and inspiring. and if you are dedicated, it works. although i love both workouts, i would buy this dvd set for the AM LATTE workout alone. it is the best ""wake-up"" call you could ever want. add this dvd set to your collection or for yoga booty ballet beginners start out with it. you won't regret it!",1229385600,2,457,4.325581395348837
