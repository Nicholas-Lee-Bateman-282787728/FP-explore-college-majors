8701889,5,B00TI79JUS,This DVD is awesome!! If you're like me and hate going to the gym and love to dance this DVD is for you!! I LOVE dancing and hate using machines but this workout uses my body as weights and incorporates real dances from Latin America and the Caribbean and it's super fun. i love how there's a section that teaches you the moves before you start so you're not completely lost your first time. I've actually used the moves I've learned at real parties.  It's not super easy like other dance fitness programs but it is waaaaay funner than Zumba!! Saka is fairly new but catching on quickly...it's a keeper for me :),1424908800,,612,4.415929203539823
8701890,5,B00TI79JUS,"Saka Dance Fitness is here to stay! I enjoy using Fitness DVDs at home whenever I can't make it to the gym. I have really enjoyed this Saka DVD! If you want an awesome ab, butt, and leg workout ALL while having FUN, then this is the DVD for you! In the past, I have tried other dance fitness DVDs and the instructors do not cue very well and just expect you to know how to do it. Patrice, on the other hand, cues well to make sure you aren't tripping over your own two feet while going from move to move.

The DVD also provides a 15 minute ""Show Me That Move"" segment where Patrice and two of the backup fitness dancers demonstrate some of the moves that will be used during the 30 minute dance party workout. This is very helpful in case you need to practice the moves that might be tough. You WILL work up a sweat and you WILL feel energized! Check it out!! YAY for Saka Dance Fitness!!",1424822400,,888,4.103448275862069
8701891,5,B00TI79JUS,"I am so not a work out person. But about a year ago I joined Patrice Saka Dance Fitness class, and like many it was a huge struggle for me I have chronic asthma and I use a inhaler and other meds as well as a Nebulizer to help control my daily struggle. Since joining I barely use my inhaler I have drop some weight and could not imagine not having Saka Dance Fitness in my life. Patrice is an amazing women and a fabulous fitness instructor, she is always there to encourage each and everyone of us. (she calls us her Saka super stars)  but she is actually the star without her many of us would be lost.  This DVD is amazing the energy is awesome. And it's the best workout to get your day going. *Kiesha*",1424736000,,706,4.108695652173913
