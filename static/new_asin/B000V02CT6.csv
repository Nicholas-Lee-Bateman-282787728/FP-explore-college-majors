8216105,5,B000V02CT6,This is one of my favorite finals of recent memory. An intense nail bitter. Played on a Monday because of rain the spectators are made up of raucous Australians making for an awesome atmosphere.,1441584000,,194,4.735294117647059

8216108,4,B000V02CT6,"Yes, an exciting match indeed.

But it's all about the serve (you may have noticed that this entire match goes on one DVD, whereas&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roger-s-match-against-Pete/dp/B000V02CUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roger's match against Pete</a>&nbsp;at the same event, which also went five sets, had to be abridged to fit).  I would guess that the average point here lasts between four and six seconds.

Good stuff none the less, well worth watching; and quite touching as Goran bursts into tears at the end, and climbs into the stands to embrace his father.  His interview is as amusing as always, and Pat Rafter is a gracious loser, able to summon a smile.

The commentators are John Barrett, John Lloyd and Pat Cash, and the sound and picture are both excellent.",1298678400,,825,5.67479674796748
8216109,5,B000V02CT6,"Could not get enough of this tennis match.  To watch the Wimbledon 2001 final with Patrick Rafter and Goran Ivanisevic going at it again was a joy.  This match was a nail-biter as the championship could have went either way.  In fact it lasted for 5 sets, and the stadium fans were very much into it till the very end.  Although you can already 'predict' the outcome (the cover shows Ivanisevic kissing the trophy), you the viewer can't help but get involved in the match.  The enthusiasm of the stadium fans is contagious; these are the rowdiest Wimbledon fans you'll every see, which added to the excitement of the moment.  Rafter and Ivanisevic were two of best tennis players of my generation, and to be able to watch this historic match again was just awesome.",1284076800,,765,4.62962962962963
8216110,4,B000V02CT6,This match is one of the best tennis matches I've seen at wimbledon.  The crowd was charged and cheering with every point.  Neither players have gotten a title before but had been finalists.  Five sets of high quality tennis.  I only gave it a four because it is tennis.,1242086400,,270,4.448979591836735
8216111,5,B000V02CT6,"What an amazing final! One could not ask for a more entertaining, thrilling & nailbiting men's Wimbledon final match-up! On one side, the previous year's runner-up, the modest & amazingly talented Pat Rafter. On the other, the fantastic & desperately proud Croatian warrior Goran Ivanisevic, who came to the prestigious final on three prior occasions, only to be denied by the legendary (yet personality-less) Sampras twice & Agassi the first time way back in 1992! And this time Goran is a wild-card entrant! Yes, that's right; a WILD-CARD entry! This is the first time in history this has happened. And on top of all that, it was hailed as ""People's Monday""! And what a tremendous & lively crowd!
In short, if I could change anything I'd change Goran's opponent to someone I didn't admire as much as I do Rafter. As an Australian-born Croatian it was clear I'd root for Goran. Nevertheless, it was an epic match which over the years I have watched many a time!
Don't hesitate; grab this one whilst it is still available. If you love enthralling tennis, you will not even think about it!
Long live Goran!",1205712000,4,1105,4.760416666666667
8216112,4,B000V02CT6,"This is one of the most exciting and unbelievable wimbledon final. A thrilling fifth set !!!
This match is best remembered because Ivanisevic was the only person to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon as a wildcard, having previously been runner-up at the championships in 1992, 1994 and 1998.",1198800000,,298,4.98
