2793790,5,B000OCY7QW,The Special on ABC was out of this world...it actually scares you. Makes you wonder how will we go...anyway it was a awesome special and I recommend this to anyone who wants to know how we will be destroyed.,1179792000,10,207,4.333333333333333
2793791,5,B000OCY7QW,"THIS SPECIAL WAS VERY GOOD AND BY FAR MOST INTERESTING. IT AIRED ON ABC ON AUGUST 31 06.....JUST THE POSIBILITIES OF OUR PLANET DESTROYING ITSELF WAS SO AMUZING TO WATCH BUT VERY FRIGHTNING. THEY EXPLAIN ABOUT 7 DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THIS MAY HAPPEN. FROM SHOOTING STARS EXPLODING BY OUR PLANET, TO PLANET EARTH BEING SUCKED INTO A BLACK WHOLE. ALSO THE AFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING. IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND VIDEOS THEY SHOW OF WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN WERE THE BEST WAY THAT YOU COULD KEEP PEOPLE LIKE ME INTERESTED.",1179273600,8,518,4.766666666666667
8184440,2,B000OCY7QW,"In this 1h30mn program scientists from leading US and British universities examine the seven kinds of threats which could destroy humanity or even most of the life on earth. The threats are rated from the less likely to happen to the ""imminent"" and they are as follows:

7. Extreme cosmic events (gamma ray burst and wandering black hole)
6. Intelligent machines
5. Supervolcano
4. Asteroid
3. Nuclear war
2. Plague
1. Global warming

The first point is actually pretty well treated and really interesting and so are also the points 5 (supervolcano) and 4 (asteroid). However there are other, better programs dealing with all those points in more detail and much better. Point 2 (plague) is honest, but pretty short and very superficial.

The points 6 and 3 are completely ludicrous - in fact I am amazing that so many highly educated people can say so many absurdities in public. Nobody seemed to realize, that no matter how intelligent and well connected via Internet the computers can be, in order to become a threat they would need a perfectly autonomous energy source and armed protection to prevent people from disconnecting them or simply destroying them (in 1991, during the First Gulf War, an American general said that the best weapon in electronic warfare is a 1000-pound laser guided bomb falling on the main enemy command center).

The threat of a global nuclear war in our times (the program was made in 2006) is also described in a laughable way, especially when a ""brilliant"" scientist says that it one accidental firing of a single missile would be enough - which is an absurdity, because even if such an unprecedented disaster happened, the country targeted would either ripost with also one missile or obtain from the guilty country a compensation of an unimaginable amount to NOT retaliate.

But all the program seems to to have only one purpose - to bring us to the point number 1, the global warming and inform us that it will not only affect our way of life but probably even destroy humanity. Al Gore is at that moment given a large speaking time - almost as if the whole film was just a part of his campaign to get the Nobel PeacePrize (which he got next year). All people who could disagree with this ""supreme truth"" about global warming are then abused and insulted by all the scientists who participate in the program with the kind of arguments the left always use to shut up their opponents - insults (""Shut up, you are a fascist"") or arguments usually used by 6 years old children (""Shut up, you stink"").

Bottom line, this was one of my least succesful purchases as far as popular scientific programs are concerned. Once I finished watching I threw my DVD to the garbage bin - do not waste your money just to be forced to do the same thing!",1356825600,,2771,4.6796714579055445
8184441,5,B000OCY7QW,"I first saw this on ABC TV a few years ago as a 20/20 primetime special. It is highly recommended viewing to anyone who ever wonders what the future of our planet would be like many many years from now in the face of a cataclysmic event, and the 7 different scenarios will shock and amaze you: Asteroid strike. Plague. Black Hole. Technology running amok. Gamma Ray Burst. These are just a few of the scary events that scientists predict could eventually wipe us out of existence. You may find it depressing in a way, but it definitely does make you think.",1350777600,,556,4.46078431372549
8184442,5,B000OCY7QW,"Great job guys.  Arrived in great time & in excellent condition.  Thanx, Mike",1276732800,,77,4.846153846153846
8184443,4,B000OCY7QW,"If our last days on Earth are to be one of the seven ways described in this video, it is indeed scary and something everyone should take note of.  It gets down to whether you believe this is the way we'll all go, or will God and Jesus just descend from the heavens and sweep up all Christians as described in the Holy Bible.  I'll take the latter any day now.",1252800000,,359,4.042253521126761
8184444,5,B000OCY7QW,"No, we're not.  I mean, most of the stuff they list isn't going to happen in our life time or even mankind's life time.  Or there isn't really anything we can do about it anyway, so why worry.  As for the nuclear missiles, germ warfare and global warning, if we don't stop it now we deserve to die anyway.  Lots of fun to watch.  I enjoyed the part about artificial intelligence the most.  Go ROBOTS!",1226188800,2,400,4.266666666666667
8184445,5,B000OCY7QW,"If anything, this special will make you wonder, and get your imagination moving.  As I was flicking through the remote control, I came across this special on the history channel.  I could not even take my eyes off of the special effects and the mind boggeling possibilities of what could happen.",1219449600,2,295,4.764705882352941
8184446,2,B000OCY7QW,"While the science in this review is mostly accurate, it has a silly focus.  It tries to grab the audience with scary speculations about cosmic disasters.  Stephen Hawking hits the nail on the head.  When the reviewer asks him to speculate about how gamma ray bursts could destroy Earth, he sensibly responds that this has not been a problem in Earth's 4.5 billion year history.  Earth is in far greater danger from human actions, he says.  Indeed.

Unfortunately, Neil deGrasse Tyson continues the alarmist drumbeat uninterrupted, ignoring Hawking's wise words.  Tyson plunges on to the next scary speculation - ooh, how could a black hole destroy us!?  Get real.  We don't have to sensationalize science to make people interested.  Reality is interesting enough, and more important.",1208649600,14,783,5.142857142857143
8184447,2,B000OCY7QW,"I mainly bought this DVD for the purpose of watching it with my family especially my parents, they don't understand Inglish and I thought that this DVD had Spanish Subtittle or a way i could of choosen from Inglish to Spanish...On the other hand this dvd was informative to what I didn't know about how the world may end. But the truth is none of us human know when and what time it is going to happen, we may use our computerize knowledge to create a dvd like this one to Emphasize viewers like me.

TO: WHO CREATED THIS DVD, PLEASE REMEBER THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH OTHER LANGUAGES THAT MAY NOT BUY YOUR PRODUCT CUZ OF THIS ISSUE.

8184448,1,B000OCY7QW,"I bought this expecting it to be a serious documentary. But I guess reality just wasn`t sensational enough for them. Instead of a documentary, this is more in line with a Michael Moore/Al Gore propaganda film.
You should take anything on TV with a grain of salt, but get yourself a salt block for this one.",1202601600,8,306,4.482142857142857
8184449,5,B000OCY7QW,Most people would think of this as depressing..but I found it very interesting. It reminds me that whatever little problems I have going on in my life..it could be worse and they're just not that important in the long run. The interviews were very interesting and the information was well thought out. I loved the CG graphics and explanations and overall just really enjoyed watching this.,1200614400,9,389,4.909090909090909
