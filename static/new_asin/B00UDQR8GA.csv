7036283,5,B00UDQR8GA,Very moving film. I had never seen a lot of the footage that appears in this film. I learned a tremendous amount about the history of the Americas and how this Pope altered that history in a positive manner. Andy Garcia is a great narrator and the modern soundtrack is captivating.,1428364800,7,281,4.529411764705882
7036284,5,B00UDQR8GA,"An excellent documentary detailing  St. John Paul II's 22 visits to the American continents throughout his remarkable pontificate and the effect these visits had on the political situations  in Brazil, Haiti  Cuba, Chile, and  Paraguay especially.

It is wonderful to see this footage of John Paul among the Bolivian miners, the destitute in  Rio de Janeiro, the Indian people in Canada, addressing the U.N.-- and to hear the reflections and recollections of many experts and observers.

And yes, it includes World Youth Day in Denver and John Paul's  visits to Mexico and Nicaragua.

If you  purchase this dvd, I truly hope that watching it empowers you anew to stand up for the dignity of the human person and religious freedom the way  John Paul  did from the day he was elected, a robust 58-year-old Pope, to his final years, bent, shaking, suffering but  always a dignified and unambiguous witness to Christ.",1428278400,9,913,4.966887417218543

7036292,5,B00UDQR8GA,"This video is so inspiringly beautiful it made me cry.  (Now) Saint John Paul brought people of all nations, religions, and philosophies together with the simple phrase, ""Be Not Afraid.""  He morally strengthened the poor and downtrodden, helped topple Communist regimes who blatantly and openly used human rights violations to maintain power, and repeatedly reinforced Christ's message that all life was sacred from conception to natural death.  He repeatedly stated in industrialized countries throughout the world that abortion was wrong regardless of their governmental permits and beliefs and their offer of upscale death mills on the corners of major modern cities. He reiterated Christ's message that people must respect their own body and then love their neighbor with action not wealth, and that any human law that conflicts with God's Commandments is wrong.  Pope John Paul reached out to the youth in a way that no pope has ever done in the past or has done thus far since.  In that action, we hold out hope for the future.  I would suggest this as a must see for anyone who is concerned with the way many church leaders seem to be conditioning and modernizing their flocks away from ""Time Honored"" Christian principles.  There is hope...""Be Not Afraid.""",1448323200,3,1264,5.0772946859903385

8705485,1,B00UDQR8GA,"This - whatever you call it, it's not a documentary - is not about the USA. It should be called John Paul II in Latin America because that's the majority of its focus. Over-the-top dramatic music and bizarre editing, not to mention self-serving revisionist history interviews with Modernist heretical commentators.

Skip it for something with solid substance that lives up to its name.",1494633600,,385,5.111111111111111
