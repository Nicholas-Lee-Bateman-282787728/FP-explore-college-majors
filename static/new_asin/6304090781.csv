8165642,5,6304090781,"Titled E=MC this film was released in the USA as Wavelength.  Starring Jeremy Piven and Kelli Williams, it features Richard Attenborough in a minor role at the end of the film.  It is a rare example of Piven in a serious role, which is well done. This film deserves better that it has received.

My review posted at IMdb in 2002 still stands true, ranks high in Google searches, and here follows:

The universe's eternal triangle, E=MC, is played out in life by Oxford academics delving into the physics of a unified field theory that stumped Einstein at the end of his years. A robust intellectual film that plays out the political realities of university professionals, and the mental and physical entanglements that can occur between people actually using their minds. A film for adults, which is real and smart and touching, about people with relationships of substance and the mysterious realities of life we cannot always explain. The journey has meaning and is enjoyable. The finale is highly satisfying and an exciting intelligent solution to both the academic and personal dilemmi, which closes the movie at full circle from whence it began. Recommended for your enjoyment and your mind.

Only available as USA/Canada VHS under name the ""Wavelength"". This film is deserving of being released on widescreen DVD, or at least DVD-R.",1267315200,,1338,4.982062780269058
