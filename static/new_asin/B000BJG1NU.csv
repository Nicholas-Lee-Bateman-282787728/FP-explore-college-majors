2420314,4,B000BJG1NU,"Although the adorable little boy at the core of this movie is barely seen, without him there would be no story.  This is a movie about the love of a father for a son.  In Chinese religion. I believe parents need children to honor them after death for religious reasons.  Therefore, this is more than just a father-child love movie; it is also somewhat a religious movie and that adds to the father's desires for his son.  The main value of the movie, first, is the glimpse it gives of Chinese culture.  Second, it shows common emotional experiences for all races.  Third, it shows some of the problems caused by illegal immigration.  All are good reasons to watch the movie.",1167782400,3,674,4.566666666666666
8087391,5,B000BJG1NU,"The amount of passion and effort that went into making this show is obvious. The character designs are interesting, the characters themselves are engaging, and the plot is simple, but moves forward with a roller coaster of entertaining events. This show is dark, gritty, gory, funny, thought provoking, and absolutely so much fun to watch! I highly recommend this series!",1524096000,,371,5.2
8087392,4,B000BJG1NU,My only complaint is it didn't say dub only. I was disappointed by that. Great anime and beautiful art and music.,1518480000,,113,4.428571428571429
8087393,4,B000BJG1NU,"It s a fun anime filled with nothing but fun interactions between the historical figures and warriors from the history books. If ever you wanted to see legends pick sides and battle it out, then this is the anime for you. The animation is different than most anime as it seems a bit more Americanized with the bold lines and wide eyes, it takes away a little from the action and the characters expressions but you get used to it. The voice actors are actually pretty good. it's a bloody and gory anime with a lot fast paced fight scenes. The story telling is a little weak as it doesn't do much for character development, it assumes you know who the famous warriors are and expects you to know their traits. You can definitely binge watch the series in no time, it's entertaining.",1515628800,,780,4.461538461538462

Also, ignore the idiots crying about some Chinese love story, I have no idea what they are on about.",1508889600,5,172,4.212121212121212

8087399,4,B000BJG1NU,"I found this film really mesmerizing. As the other reviewer states, honoring one's parents is pretty central in Chinese culture and this is a film about a man whose son is alienated and taken away from him. There were a few scenes that were obviously staged and somewhat stilted (for example when he rides his motorcycle up toward a group of children crossing the street, jamming on his brake at the last minute, and they all simply stop and stare at him with nobody saying a word--that was quite fake), but overall the filming was interesting and the character remained consistent. The angles and shots of actors from behind or behind mosquito nets added to the sense of loss. The main actor was really amazing and I almost believed (but not quite) that the really pretty girl fell in love with him enough to sacrifice everything. I would give this one 3.6 stars and maintain that it's an interesting window into Chinese culture and family life.",1356652800,,946,4.704819277108434
8087400,2,B000BJG1NU,"This movie simply didn't grip me. I watch a lot of Chinese movies, and I'm well aware of the drama for Chinese living and society - for all the glam that is currently hyped on it now. Yet this movie had nothing to offer, but long silences, slow sequences and an implausible - nearly non-existent! - story line. Bleak countryside, a sullen protagonist, a desperate heroine all make for 2 hours better spent doing something else. What a disappointment from the director of 'In Love We Trust'!",1268956800,,490,4.64367816091954
