2455466,4,B000CC1TVU,"I enjoyed seeing Phil Silvers and Jack Benny together in a western.  It was of course your NOT run of the mill western.  I was pleasantly surprised at how the opening minutes set the tone for the movie and the reactions of the bad guys played by Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef and character actors.

It's not on the level of movies like High Noon of course, but then I didn't expect it to be.  Watching this movie was pleasant trip into the past to see two comedy alive and well, and on my tv screen!",1367798400,5,494,4.114583333333333
2455467,4,B000CC1TVU,"The films include a company logo superimposed in the corner. I know why the companies do it but if enough people wrote letters and complained about it, or mailed the DVDs back to the supplier, that would stop. Had there not been a logo superimposed on the corner, I would have been very content. But for watching old Westerns (especially the Phil Silvers/Jack Benny comedy) and one can ignore the logo, grab this DVD for the price.",1345420800,3,431,4.6103896103896105
2455468,5,B000CC1TVU,"Quality is great. Enjoy watching westerns & several are based on true stories like 'Legends of the Old West' with Jim Davis; '26 Men' with Chris Coffin, about the Arizona Rangers who helped the Arizona Territory become a state. One day one won't be able to purchase these westerns. We shouldn't forget the Pioneer times, they are history. From the 1800's(even before) till beginning of 1900's, but the ones I'm talking about, narrater says 1860's or 1870's. Then as someone said, the towns got littered with shopping malls, stores, you name it, towns grew so much, pioneer times behind. Western films show the way men & women had to work hard w/o the luxuries we have today. Those were the women, they had to work hard to survive while the men went out hunting or buying stuff to work the land & care for the horses(I'm sure the dogs also)where they had at their homestead, that then took a day or depending how many miles they lived from town. Things were less expensive, but well made.",1248220800,6,987,4.613636363636363
8096737,5,B000CC1TVU,Fun to see Benny and Silver teamed up.  Two great comedians in one film.,1524355200,,72,4.142857142857143
8096738,3,B000CC1TVU,This movies honestly wasn't as funny as I'd hoped it would be with Jack Benny and Phil Silvers staring in it but it was a pleasant way to spend an evening.  Not great but not bad.  :),1462406400,,183,3.918918918918919
8096739,4,B000CC1TVU,The 'Slowest Gun in the West' is perhaps worth the price of this DVD alone...written by Nat Hiken (who wrote most of the Sgt. Bilko programs).  Truly a witty way of turning a city around based on the characters.  Performances were stellar and Phil Silvers and Jack Benny both at their best!,1432684800,,290,4.5576923076923075
8096740,5,B000CC1TVU,It is GREAT,1423872000,,11,3.0
8096741,1,B000CC1TVU,Not jack Benny's best work but predictable,1423008000,,42,5.142857142857143
8096742,5,B000CC1TVU,"I bought this for the Cisco Kid series and the other movies are a nice bonus, especially the Slowest Gun In The West. It's funny watching fast draws trying to get out of a shooting match because whoever kills the slowest gun in the west will be a laughing stock. Buy it, you'll like it.",1422403200,,286,4.218181818181818

8096745,5,B000CC1TVU,"I boiught this DVD mainly for the Phil Silvers and Jack Benny farce, but appreciated the other offerings, too.  So nice to watch the old westerns where the good guys always win and no scene is inappropriate for children.",1374192000,3,220,4.641025641025641
8096746,5,B000CC1TVU,"This is not a great remastered video, but it's very watchable and one of my favorite childhood TV tales.  It still stands as that upon rewatching, many decades later.",1368748800,,166,4.724137931034483
