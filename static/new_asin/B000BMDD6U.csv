2424308,5,B000BMDD6U,"Real Life - This is a documentary that is both educational and entertaining.  The video follows Myrna Loy and William Powell through their careers beginning with the silent films and going through ""talkies"" and the more recent films.  I have been a fan of Nick & Nora for years, but I still learned things I didn't know before.
Powell played a villain for years. He enjoyed the roles and added to the dimensions of the characters.
He finally moved on to bigger parts and playing the lead characters.
Loy played a foreign type of siren in many films, until film makers finally realized she had her own personality and appeal. The documentary tells a lot about Myrna Loy's work with our soldiers and the USO.  She devoted a bit part of her life, when she could have been making movies, to helping our troops.

On Screen - We watch as Nick & Nora get married and raise a son, Nicky. He grows older as they do. They seem like real people, and the public even thinks they are really married.  Myrna Loy said, even better - we are friends. Their films as a collection show that marriage can be a partnership and wives are not just ""the little woman.""

Nick & Nora's dog Asta was quite a character himself. There are several scenes where he ""steals"" the show.",1270944000,3,1252,4.469298245614035
2424309,3,B000BMDD6U,"William Powell was a dapper gentlemen whose career transcended the silent screen to the sound screen. He appeared in many movies first as a villain, then as a detective, and later as a wealthy aristocratic type. Myrna Loy followed a similar career. She often played exotic seductresses in her early films, then transitioned to motherly roles. Both found a hit when they appeared together in The Thin Man, which became a the longest running movie series starring a famous pair in history.

As the title of this DVD suggests, the documentaries both spend a great length of time talking about Powell and Loy's involvement in The Thin Man series. The rest of their lives are brushed by quickly as to have enough time to talk about their pairing. However, neither film had to be rushed as each are well under an hour long. It would have been more satisfying if the documentaries were more thorough.

Also included here is a radio show starring Powell and Loy, and a television episode modelled after The Thin Man with a different cast.",1191456000,17,1030,4.748603351955308

8089052,4,B000BMDD6U,"This DVD comes with ""The Complete Thin Man Collection"" and features 2 separate documentaries about the stars William Powell and Myrna Loy.  It is also available as a stand alone disc.  Powell's documentary is from 2005 and was produced by TNT Television.  It is formally titled ""William Powell: A True Gentleman.""  The Myrna Loy profile is from 1990 also from TNT and is titled ""Myrna Loy: So Nice To Come Home To.""

The Powell doc is narrated by Kevin Kline and Kathleen Turner handles the Loy film.  Both are slightly different in delivery but both exude praise over the careers of both stars.  Both were stars before the ""Thin Man"" series and both went on to act in great films.  We get bits about their childhood, early life, early films and the prestige they both earned.  Very interesting if not astounding stuff.

This disc also includes an episode of the 1958 TV series, called ""Darling, I Loathe You.""  The series featured Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk and this episode stinks to be honest.  I think the show only lasted one year.  No sparkle, no chemistry.  There is also an episode of the radio ""Thin Man"" show with Powell and Loy doing the voices.  The 2 docs run about 77 minutes.",1407456000,,1194,4.619047619047619
8089053,4,B000BMDD6U,"Gee, a drunk detective that actually solves crimes.  The movies are corny, but it is a nice break from the gore shown on most of them.  I really like the movies.",1393286400,,161,4.161290322580645
8089054,3,B000BMDD6U,"This is made up of two documentary biographies: ""William Powell: A True Gentleman"" and ""Myrna Loy: So Nice to Come Home To."" I learned a lot about both, including the fact that they did some 17 movies together, not just the six Thin Man movies. They both did well in silent films before going into talkies. Powell started out in Broadway theater and went to the movies; Loy came to film first and went to Broadway soon after the last Thin Man film. She also got quite involved in liberal political causes during that same time.

One thing this double biography has yielded is a nice long list of films to look for.",1336694400,2,614,4.433628318584071
8089055,4,B000BMDD6U,"Myrna Loy and William Powell share a unique place in cinema history - being paired on the screen no less than fourteen times (a record yet to be beaten).  In addition to their iconic roles of Nick and Nora Charles in the six ""Thin Man"" films, Loy and Powell also starred together in such favourites as ""Libeled Lady"", ""The Great Ziegfeld"", and ""Manhattan Melodrama"".

This disc (included as an extra in Warners' complete ""Thin Man"" collection boxset) highlights the careers of Loy and Powell in two good *albeit brief* retrospectives.

Kathleen Turner hosts 1991's MYRNA LOY: SO NICE TO COME HOME TO (originally part of the ""Hollywood Remembers"" TV series).  Turner's hosting and narration is understated and reverential, and hinges on Loy's trailblazing efforts as a female in the male-dominated world of moviemaking.  Myrna Loy herself was still alive at the time of this documentary, so it's a very upbeat, celebratory affair.  There's lots of footage from her films (including the then recently-rediscovered colour excerpt of Loy's performance in 1929's ""The Show of Shows""); and the doco ends with Kathleen Turner presenting Loy with her Kennedy Center Honor.

Running just under 30 minutes, 2005's WILLIAM POWELL: A TRUE GENTLEMAN is an all-too-brief retropsective of Powell's long and successful career, which ranged from theatre into silent films and finally fame in Talkies.  Narrated by Michael York and featuring a series of talking heads (the usual suspects including film historian Rudy Behlmer); this doco won't hold anything new for William Powell fans, but operates as a good introduction for newcomers.

This disc also includes the ""Darling I Loathe You"" episode from MGM's eventual TV series of THE THIN MAN, which starred Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk (""House of Wax"") as the society sleuths.",1307664000,4,1812,5.1993127147766325
