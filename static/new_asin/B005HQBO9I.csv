4702845,4,B005HQBO9I,"I really like this movie for an interesting change of pace from a typical WWII battle movie. The story-line is interesting and suspenseful and I understand from other sources is based on a true story. Ralph Richardson is an accomplished London stage actor of the time and appears in many WWII movies. Esmond Knight who lost an eye in WWII and has not recovered vision in the other eye is essentially acting blind in this movie and as such does a great job. I was particularly interested in authenticity as the movie was released in 1943, however, I was pleased as parts of the movie depicted life in the Netherlands during Nazi occupation. This movie has historical significance other than just the story as I understand all information and films released to the public during the war years in Britain came under the scrutiny of the MoI (Ministry of Information). Therefore it is my belief that other than mere entertainment value the movie's purpose was that of a morale booster especially considering D Day was just months away.",1322870400,151,1030,4.792134831460674
4702846,5,B005HQBO9I,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""THE SILVER FLEET"" (1943) (88 min/B&W) -- Starring: Ralph Richardson, Googie Withers, Esmond Knight, Beresford Egan, Frederick Burtwell, Kathleen Byron, Willem Akkerman, Dorothy Gordon, Charles Victor, John Longden

Directed by: Vernon Campbell Sewell & Gordon Wellesley

(VCI's slant on the synopsis)
Set during the occupation of Holland during World War II, Ralph Richardson, in a very charismatic role, stars as the owner of a Dutch shipyard who pretends to collaborate with the Nazis in order to protect his wife and fellow workers. Inspired by the memory of the Dutch historical hero Piet Hein, he forms a complicated plan to double cross the Nazis and to sabotage the two submarines he's been ordered to build for them.

The Silver Fleet a lesser known World War II film, but very well done with an excellent cast, great direction and a screenplay that has non-stop scenes loaded with tension. Ralph Richardson gives one of his best performances of his career.

A truly rousing and patriotic WWII film, with an ending that is quite moving. This film has long been under appreciated.

Special footnote: ~ Esmond Knight, who had lost an eye during the war, had not yet regained the use of his remaining eye when he played the role of Von Schiffer. Playing his part completely blind, there is only one scene when the audience can guess Knight's disability. It occurs quite briefly when Knight, about to go through a doorway, is gently steered through the door by a fellow actor.

4702864,5,B005HQBO9I,"I concur with the statement of several commentators that this movie, ""The Silver Fleet"" has been overlooked as par excellence among the true stories of World War II.  Sir Ralph Richardson was the right choice for the lead actor about the owner of a Dutch shipyard who pretends to be a Quisling - a public collaborator with the Nazis, but was an undercover agent in the tradition of a historic Dutch Hero, Piet Hein.  As a double agent,
he protected his family and the workers.  The Nazis were astounded by the sabotage of the two submarines that he built for them.  This film is more than just a portrayal of WW II patriotism - it is real heroism true to life.  Very pleased to have discovered this DVD for my WW II collection, because Dutch heroes and heroines have not received the recognition they deserve.  The only criticism I have is there are no captions in English.  Still it is right up there with 5 stars!",1483574400,8,915,4.475903614457831

But don't believe it for a moment.  He is secretly the head of the resistance  and realizes that he must cooperate or watch his loved ones suffer under Nazi rule. But as he cooperates ""his"" way, we soon realize that it is not important that he builds boats for the Nazis, but it is important, ""how he builds them""  The last scene is indicative of just how much courage and determination it took to defeat the Nazis.",1465948800,,740,4.451851851851852

hand The Silver Fleet was boring, no action, but good for insomnia. After the ""The End"" it went into the trash can. I am going to be more careful in

It doesn't have the tension of films like Bridge on the River Kwai, or The Train, but I found the narrative of Richardson's shipyard owner/ saboteur easy to watch. The Nazis are a nasty piece of work as you'd expect, and it's fun to watch the townspeople put the puzzle together and then try to do something about the tough spot they find themselves in.

However, although the sound is passable, the viewing picture is not, at least on the DVD I purchased through Amazon.  It has the ""Deer in the Headlights"" look.  What I mean by this is that as you are trying to watch a scene, it's as if the actors are not in front of a camera, but rather a big truck with it's headlights on them.  It's so washed out it's hard to make out peoples faces.  You might see eyeballs and mouths, but faces are all too bright white to be considered ""Glorious B & W.""  It looks as if that big truck has it's ""Hi-beams or brights"" on in most of the scenes and throughout the flick.  It's very difficult to follow a movie in which you cannot even see the actors faces properly.

4702974,5,B005HQBO9I,"To enjoy this movie there are a few things you need to know up front. This is not an action movie. It is plot driven, somewhat stodgy and slow-paced but no more so than virtually any other movie of this era. This movie may have been intended as a propaganda piece but it is driven by the acting and the writing rather than overt histrionics.

The factual basis for this movie refers to an incident wherein Dutch yard workers seized control of a submarine on its way to the German Navy and instead presented it to the British Navy. From this event the writers /directors Vernon Sewall and Gordon Wellesley crafted a later day version of the Scarlet Pimpernel. In this case Dutch engineer and shipyard operator Jaan Van Leyden (Sir Ralph Richardson) allows himself to be publicly known as a ""quisling"" or Nazi collaborator while secretly conducting resistance under the name Piat Hein.

The story is told simply with no special effects, making the best of a cast works who work well together and directors who allowed the story to unfold while the drama builds naturally. Of course the Germans are shown as arrogant and incompetent but this is done without caricature or the usual wartime exaggeration.

Allowing for the fact that the pacing is as movie pacing was in the 1940s; the sum quality of the various performances and the ability of the story to build dramatic tension -despite the fact that we think we know what the outcome will be; this movie totals out to a superior product at a reasonable price. This movie is better than just a popcorn movie and as a dramatic performance beats out most World War II ""blow `em ups"".

In my copy sound and visuals were more than adequate. I was not distracted by any film to disk failures.",1362182400,25,1735,4.623376623376624

4702976,5,B005HQBO9I,"I won't give it away by telling what happened, but I thought it was wonderful in every way. Movie makers today need a lesson in movie making, and quit depending on the special effects to sell the film. This has it all!

4702977,1,B005HQBO9I,"When my DVD arrived and I saw that the cover was different than that pictured on Amazon, and that the case had no mention of ""VCI"" or ""The Rank Collection"" but instead displayed that it was produced by ""Inspired Distribution"" (""Visit us at: [...]""), and that I had just recently been supremely dissapointed by the quality of transfer for another movie that came from Inspired Distribution (see my review of ""Spitfire: The First of the Few"", called ""Horrible Transfer!""), I then realized I was just about to open another dissapointment. No way! Not a second time! The common denominator is that these products are both sold by ""Ocean Breeze Media"" out of Miami Beach, Florida. I will not buy another product sold by them!

4702978,5,B005HQBO9I,"Wonderful film, very low key wartime drama about wily Dutch shipyard owner ""Jaap van Leyden"" who outwits the Nazi occupiers using the nom de guerre of Piet Hein.  Top notch performance by Sir Ralph Richardson as Van Leyden and other British players who portray the workers and inhabitants of the shipyard town.  The ""Silver Fleet"" refers  to the Dutch naval hero Piet Hein, who won a  victory over a Spanish ""Silver Fleet"" in 1628.  A song praising Admiral Hein's capture of the Spanish ""silver fleet"" written in 1844 is sung by children in a primary school in the film which gives Van Leyden his inspiration to secretly work against the Germans while pretending to be a collaborator.  You will enjoy the twists and turns and clever plotting by Van Leyden, with emotional cost to him when his wife, who does not know of his Resistance work, painfully turns away from him leading to the conclusion and Van Leyden's courageous act.  By the way, naming the character Van Leyden was no accident; when Piet Heit returned from his journey, he was cheered by the Dutch in the town of Leyden!

When Schmidt (the Quisling) comes to Von Leyden to rat out the plot to hijack sub 107 Von Leyden says to him ""good man Schmidt"" The subtitle reads ""Tell it to the government"".

None of the submarines built in his shipyard sank a ship.  None of the actors are well known but John Wayne/Gary Cooper/Clint Eastwood can't be in every movie.
