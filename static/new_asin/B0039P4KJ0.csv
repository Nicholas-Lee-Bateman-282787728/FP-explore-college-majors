The whole concept of a 50's/60's holiday camp is great.  You find yourself getting into the story so much, almost like you are a part of the fun.",1514678400,2,268,4.32

8392250,5,B0039P4KJ0,"Hi de  hi, was a fantastic show it ran from 1980-88 and was consistantly funny. Simon Cadell (rip) was it's breakout atar  in this  The show featured a holiday camp in the south of the uk. It takes place starting in 1959 and continues until the last season in 1966 or so. The stories are very funny and the series was one of the more popular in the uk during it's run. It has a great ensemble cast that is similiar to the 'are you being served' and other great brit shows of the era.  This one is alot of fun and the dvd's look pretty nice.  The show was out on vhs here so I don't know why we never got this domestically. You have to have a all region  player to watch these dvds. These are not that expensive however and this will allow you to watch dvd's from anywhere in the world. Not all blu rays though.  THis is on regular dvd so that's a good thing.  hi de hi!! that's the chant for great classic comedy , right up there with 'dad's army' to be sure. This includes all the episodes including the christmas specials.",1324857600,6,1024,4.110552763819095
