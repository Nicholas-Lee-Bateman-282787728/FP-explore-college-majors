3555446,2,B001EL6ECM,"It didn't bother me that the picture quality was the same as the previously released volumes, which I thought were fine.  But I am upset that the sound is noticeably lower (and sometimes a little muffled).  This did not occur on the Seasons 1 through 5 that I already owned, which proves the fact that the films being made in the 1970s is not the problem (nor is the sound a problem on any other 1960s or 1970s TV shows I have).  No... the manufacturer has screwed up... and it's really annoying when the sound on the DVD musical introduction is loud as can be, and then the actual show starts and the sound drops by half the decibels, forcing one to turn the volume up on the TV to 100% capacity!  It was so bad I thought I has a defective set, and had it replaced.  The new one is exactly the same, so it's a mistake to be seen in all of these sets.  It's probably better to buy the individual Season 1-9 sets even though you lose the cute and lovable packaging. One complaint about the packaging making it hard to get the DVDs in and out of is not valid, by the way.  The Complete Set comes in a 3 ring binder.  To get the DVDs out, you take the individual sheet that holds three DVDs out of the binder first -- then they slide out easily.
  Feb. '09 Update:  After watching nearly all of the shows, I would change my star rating to 3 from a 2.  The low sound is not as bad on some of the discs as others.  But all comments above to the fact that this was never a problem in the earlier releases still apply.",1230595200,25,1511,4.081355932203389
3555447,5,B001EL6ECM,"I read the reviews here about this set and people complained about a variety if things. I haven't found any of them to be true.

I watch Little House everyday and I was shocked at how beautiful the shows are- the coloring and clarity. Plus, no commercials. The shows do cut off where commercials were suppose to be, but it has to be that way because certain scenes end in a way that make you anxious to get through the commercial to see what will happen next. If they made everything just run together the show wouldn't be as exciting.

This set is cute and there are so many special features. I am shocked at so much from the interviews. Dean Butler took a great amount of time to create features that would inform us and make us feel a part of this series so many love.

This is an expensive set, but we don't regret it. We love it and will cherish it forever.",1230508800,2,862,4.212121212121212
3555448,5,B001EL6ECM,Me and my family have loved Little House on the Prairie since I was a little tike! The authentic style of early western pioneers mirrors what we go through everyday. We watch to see how they handle their lives and that can give us some insight on how we need to handle ours. If we all just taught our children some of the fundamental things that is shown in this series then we all would sleep a little easier. Definitley a choice to buy! I recommend it to everyone!!,1226880000,5,467,4.258426966292135
3555449,3,B001EL6ECM,"I'm pretty happy to have all the episodes, the three final movies and all the special features.  I deducted a star because the sound and picture look about how they did thirty years ago, or maybe worse, and another star because the three special features disks at the back of the binder got caught under the binding during shipping and got very scratched.  Although they look really badly damaged they do play fine.  The wagon packaging looks fun but it's hard to pull the disks out without scratching them on the binder posts.  I guess giving scenes a purple tint is what's called color enhancement.",1226016000,21,600,4.685714285714286
3555450,5,B001EL6ECM,"Just recieved an advance copy and watched most of the 7+ hours of ""never before seen"" extras. Those alone should be encouragement enough to pop for what I believe is an excellent value. Unless you are a videophile, don't buy into the nae-sayers!  The most important thing is that the discs are of an excellent quality. The images are crisp and bright (on my 720i line tv) and the timeless stories of love, family and virtue come through as if viewed for the first time.  If I had to point out one small item that I would have changed, it would have been to offer the set not making use of cardboard sleeves. At least for me the jury is still out on how they affect the discs over time.  But I also recognize that with a 60 disc package, it would be difficult, not to mention how changes would affect the bottom line pricepoint.  The wagon is clever and sits on my standard size DVD shelves with no problem. Not too high or thin as is the case (no pun intended) with my ""Sex In The City"" collectors set.

Do yourself a favor and order it while the price is good.  And I say to you videophiles...wait for the Blueray or remastered edition (could be years) for your 1080i system.

The rest of you, Enjoy!",1225497600,19,1201,4.287610619469026
3555451,5,B001EL6ECM,"""Little House on the Prairie"" premiered in 1974 as a movie (sometimes called the ""pilot movie"" or the ""premiere movie""). The series then ran for a total of 8 full seasons, from 1974 until 1982, and an extra season (the 9th) from 1982 until 1983 by the title ""Little House: A New Beginning."" It concluded with 3 TV movies during 1983-1984 (these are sometimes called ""season 10"" and have since been repackaged as part of the ""Little House: A New Beginning"" series). During the run of the series there were many extended eps that ran as 2-partners or double long programs and some shows that were 90 minutes in length. There was also a Thanksgiving retrospective special movie titled ""The Little House Years"" from 1979 (although this is not part of season 6, this 3-part program thas been broken up into 3 eps and in syndication it pops up in this season, although it is not included on the DVDs).

Michael Landon (may he rest in peace) was the star, executive producer, director and in some cases even writer of LHOTP. As Charles Ingalls he was also the voice of compassion and the voice of forgiveness and redemption. I can't think of another TV character that is more loved and more known for being a good man and a good father than Charles Ingalls and that's because of Michael Landon. Michael Landon gave life to a man that most of us never knew before. He gave him a heart. But most of all, Michael Landon's best work was done in the back of the house, not on camera. Because he wasn't some big-shot who needed to be seen and who needed to be some big star, he was just happy producing quality television. And that's really the cusp of LHOTP: quality. Because of Mr. Landon, the series resonates with just about everyone. I cannot think of another person who is or was ever able to accomplish such a behemoth task. He set a standard of excellence that no one has ever been able to match, before or since.

What I loved the most about Charles Ingalls was that he was just a regular man. He didn't have any super powers, he didn't fly through the air, he wasn't rich and he wasn't worldly. But you know what? That didn't matter because Michael Landon gave him such a warm spirit. Perhaps this was the first time on TV that it was OK for a man to cry because Charles Ingalls was very sensitive. For kids to see this was exceptional because it told them that it was OK to share their feelings and it was fine to be afraid. I am reminded of a statement from the series (Fight Team Fight!/Season 7), ""hurting someone doesn't make you a man, it's learning to love them.""

But that doesn't mean that Charles was a pushover in the slightest bit. He had a nice right-hook, especially concerning the well-being of his family. I love the time when Charles went up against those 2 men who made a lewd comment about Mary (""that's a mighty good looking blind girl you got"") and Charles beat them silly. Like Mr. Kenny Rogers said, ""sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man.""

Over the years the cast changed rapidly and readily, but that didn't matter to the viewers. Because even though Michael Landon wasn't on every ep, he could still be heard. His voice came though loud and clear. These are some of the main cast of characters on LHOTP during its entire run:
Michael Landon / Charles Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-8, season 9 2 eps and in 2 of the final TV movies)
Alison Arngrim / Nellie Oleson (seasons 1-7, 1 ep during season 8 and in 1 of the final TV movies, playing a different role)
Karen Grassle / Caroline Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-8 and in 1 of the final TV movies)
Victor French / Mr. Edwards (pilot movie, seasons 1-3, recurring briefly in some seasons afterward, season 9 and in some of the final TV movies)
Melissa Sue Anderson / Mary Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-7 and season 8 2 eps)
Merlin Olsen / Jonathan Garvey (seasons 4-8 recurring)
Matthew Laborteaux / Albert Ingalls (in 1 ep during seasons 2 & 4, season 5 recurring, seasons 6-8, season 9 1 ep and in 1 of the TV movies)
Karl Swenson / Lars (seasons 1-4 recurring and in 1 ep during season 5)
Hersha Parady / Alice Garvey (seasons 4-6 recurring)
Ketty Lester / Hester-Sue Terhune (seasons 5-9 recurring and in some of the final TV movies)
Shannen Doherty / Jenny Wilder (season 9 and in some of the final TV movies)
Ruth Foster / Miss Melinda Foster (pilot movie-uncredited role, seasons 1-9 recurring)
Katherine MacGregor / Mrs. Harriet Oleson (seasons 1-9 recurring)
Richard Bull / Nelsen Oleson (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)
Jonathan Gilbert / Willie Oleson (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)
Kevin Hagen / Dr. Hiram Baker (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)
Dabbs Greer / Reverend Alden (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)
Lindsay & Sydney Greenbush / Caroline Ingalls (pilot movie and seasons 1-8)
Wendi and Brenda Turnbaugh / Grace Ingalls (seasons 4-8 recurring)
Melissa Gilbert / Laura Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-9 and in the final 3 TV movies)

As someone who has grown up watching LHOTP I can tell you with all honesty and certainty that every single ep is excellent because each one has a value all its own. There is a lesson to each and every episode of LHOTP but it's never hokey or preachy and it's always different. However the one message that I always got out of the series was to have compassion. And, perhaps the second most learned lesson that I took from the series was to have trust because in the end we are all in essence good people.

These are some of my very favorite eps of ""Little House on the Prairie"":
If I Should Wake Before I Die (season 1)
With the help of Charles and Caroline, Miss Amy brings her entire family together to celebrate her life.

As Long As We're Together part 1 (season 5)

Included in this comprehensive 60-DVD set is a total of 203 episodes of ""Little House on the Prairie"" (as well as 4 TV movies). The boxed set is packaged very cleverly to look like an old-fashioned covered wagon. Where else can you find a wagon filled with your favorite TV show? And each disc includes a stunning silkscreen picture on it in vivid and vibrant color.

In celebration of LHOTP's 35th anniversary there are also a bunch of documentaries and featurettes. And there is even one all about Michael Landon. Made just for this collection, this details Mr. Landon's legacy, his visionary work as both a performer, an achieved director and a pioneer in the visual arts.

Although the series never had a break-out character, Nellie Oleson was always a crowd pleaser. Here was this greedy, hateful little girl that had such a nasty disposition that everyone could relate to and almost root for. Viewers around the world loved to hate Nellie and it was no surprise that out of every performer from the show Alison Arngrim received the most fan mail (or hate mail). But she always managed to capture her audience because there was a remarkable quality to her that made viewers identify. Maybe it was because Nellie said and did what we all secretly wanted to do? Or maybe it was her very pronounced voice; with that high-pitched, loud almost piercing tone, was it any wonder that Nellie's voice was not manufactured in the slightest? My absolute favorite scene with Nellie was the time she set up Laura (who, by now was getting a tad self-righteous) to fail her teaching exam. Laura is spitting bullets after leaving the school-house as she catches Nellie coming back from Almonzo's place. Nellie says in her best condescending voice (with a nice broad smile on her face), ""Hello Laura, I sure hope you don't think I had anything to do with it."" It sure was great to see Nellie knock Princess-Laura down to reality. Classic! You don't want to miss everyone's favorite spoiled rich-girl as she narrates some of her nastiest Nellie eps on this set.

This also includes many special features, exclusively only available with this set. There are new interviews with just about every surviving cast member from the series, including: football great Merlin Olsen, Scottie MacGregor and Karen Grassle. Melissa Sue Anderson even comes out of semi-retirement to discuss the critically-acclaimed series that made her the most famous blind television character in the entire history of American pop-culture.

The series was based on the unparalleled children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder (later by Rose Wilder Lane). However, after the third season rather than relying as heavily on the books, the writers and the producers took more poetic license. IMO these are some of the best eps because they are all so creative and life-affirming, not to mention wholesome and articulate. If you want to see a quality series then I strongly recommend getting ""Little House on the Prairie: The Complete Television Series.""",1223337600,18,14229,4.64609872611465

3555483,1,B001EL6ECM,"Ok all the shows are here.  The case *looks* cool.  The price is better than individually buying the sesaons.  However, do not get it.  They are placed in small plastic baggies then put into paper sleeves.  I have a few thousand DVDs and these are packaged horribly.  Many had scratches (the kind that do not come out easy).  Out of the 4 we tried 2 played and another one half worked.  Not a good percentage.  I understand why they did it this way as 9 seasons is a *lot* of DVDs.  However, they fall out easy and get scratched easily on the case.  I had a few come out just opening the case and they could stuck under the binder very easily.

The amazon reseller was cool and refunded my money (5 stars to them!).  I will be going with the individual seasons now.

When it was on TV regularly I never realized it was this good.  My wife has always been a big fan.  Each episode is warm, suspenseful and packed with moral dilemmas that we confront even today.  I could not think of a more entertaining way to teach morals and good ethics to your kids, teens and yourself than through watching this excellent classic.  The packaging is superb includes a number of extra features and trivia.  A great idea and a rare find. Excellent for establishing a family night (1 1/2 hrs of movie, popcorn and discussion).  Even the naysayers in your family will be drawn to this after a few episodes.

It boggles my mind that a company would cut any program from it's original version thinking that viewers will not mind.  No one that is not a dedicated fan of any program is going to buy a complete series knowing it has been cut from what originally aired.  There is no doubt in my mind that anyone that has bought this set was unaware that they were getting a cut version. They saw the set and bought without first reading the reviews of others that had made the same mistake.  I also wonder how they can call it a complete series when it has been cut.  I will be paying only a few more dollars for the individual UNCUT seasons but it will be well worth it to get all the episodes as they should be released...In their original uncut version in which they were meant to be viewed.",1313107200,5,1003,4.3138297872340425

Or how about re-buying all your favorite movies all over again that you already own on full version dvds just to get the edited versions? I will repeat, that is just as RIDICULOUS and they'll be lucky if I pay $30 for this 60 disc box set because thats all they're worth when the shows are NOT complete.

3555492,5,B001EL6ECM,"Each Little House on the Prairie episode is a stand-alone gem of a story, so having the complete series has been such a joy for our family.  I really like how so many DVDs are organized in a compact box that looks like a wagon, and descriptions of each episode are provided to help with show selection and screening.  We often watch the shows with our 3-year old who loves them, but life on the prairie was sometimes harsh and there are some episodes we're saving for later.  This series gets my highest recommendation!",1307059200,2,519,4.5
3555493,5,B001EL6ECM,"First, on the set, I think it is fantastic. Big deal if fades for commercials are present ... it sure beats having to fast forward through commercials! My family is almost finished with season 2 and the discs have all played fine. We do have to turn the volume up a few notches on the TV, but no big deal.

As for the show itself, I never watched Little House much as a kid. But now I am watching it with my family with kids ages 12, 10, and 6, and they all love the show! Episodes are about 45 minutes long, and we often watch one after supper before bedtime. This sure beats the garbage that is on Prime Time now. Nothing compares to Little House with moral teachings and how it shows the importance of faith in the life of the family.

Each episode consistently teaches a lesson. It is top quality acting. Plenty of humor, action, drama, family friendly -- what more could you ask for? The show does an excellent job of bringing the viewer into the action ofthe story. It can be emotional! At least half of the episodes brings my wife and I to soft tears of joy or sadness. Nothing else on TV comes close. This set is well worth the money and an excellent buy. I bought mine off of ebay as it was about $50 cheaper.",1300233600,4,1218,4.178723404255319

I contacted Amazon and, after a discussion re it being too late to do anything!, sent the whole package back for replacement. I specified ""REPLACEMENT"".
 I was given a refund and when I protested, was told the refund had been issued, it was not alterable and that my only option was to repurchase the item. The original purchase cost me 99.39, The refund was for 95.01 which did NOT cover return postage and the new order has been charged at 142.57. I reordered in early december 2010 and have yet to recieve it, let alone be able to check it for playabilty.
I consider this to be extremely poor service by Amazon and am therefore VERY unlikely to buy from the American site again.

The other ones, for whatever reason, cannot be read.  I'm disappointed that I spent a good chunk of money and the product is defective on more than one disc.  I have an e-mail in to Amazon to see how to handle this issue.  If the product worked fine, I would be giving this 5 stars.  I'm not sure how common a problem this is, but it's the only thing I would be cautious of if you plan to order the entire series.

3555500,5,B001EL6ECM,"So the quality could be better, and so could the editing and sound. Also there is a spot or two when the audio is briefly out of sync. Big deal, I imagine it's about the same as when it originally aired, far from being HD like we're all used to now. I think it adds to the series personally.

I bought this series for my wife last Christmas, having never seen more than one episode myself ever. My wife opened it amid a dozen kids, nieces, and family members. There was wrapping paper littering my house a foot deep. Since a huge snowstorm was bearing down on us in Texas (unusual), we decided to get everyone out the door and head home by 9pm.

So there I sat, nothing to do but wait for Christmas morning, so I popped in the first DVD and started watching the first episode of HER gift. I was so taken by the series, that I watched 6 episodes that first night on Christmas Eve. I completed the 61st DVD on February 25th, 2010. It only took me 62 days to watch all 61 discs (that includes the pilot which I purchased about a week after starting to watch.)

I must say, the shows are so nostalgic, it just makes me wonder why nothing like this exists on TV anymore. I went off the deep-end, saw the LHOTP stage presentation when it came to Fort Worth with Melissa Gilbert as Ma. About that same time all 3 main girls (Allison Arngrim, Melissa Gilbert, and Melissa Sue Anderson) all came out with a book within weeks of each other. I bought all 3 and read all 3.

Bottom line is this: you don't have to be an original watcher of the series to love these shows. I never saw more than one growing up, and I loved it after seeing the first episode. If you are looking for something to lift your spirits, to take you back to a simpler time, to show you what true family morals are all about, nothing beats this show in my opinion.",1291593600,12,1825,4.176136363636363
3555501,3,B001EL6ECM,"I absolutely adore these shows. However, I have been reviewing these shows on Netflix and saw how the editing and sound was bad. I was hoping that they would have done a better job when they released the collection but from what I read, doesn't look like they changed much. No remastered? Color restore? Nothing? Bummer. I first saw this collection debut at $115 on Amazon. I had then went back a week later and it jumped considerably in price. BOO!!

I just watched Season 7: Portrait of Love - I had to try so hard not to look at their mouths as the audio wasn't in sync. I hate that! Or if you are watching a truly warm moment and then it just abruptly cuts to the next scene. I must say that when it had commercials, they were a bit more delicate on how they changed over. Sad to say. How about a nice fade or something? No room for resonance at all. Surely they could have done better with the way they edited these films but apparently the editors didn't have the fans in mind. Seems they just wanted to put it on a dvd and make money. For the quality output on these dvds, I will gladly wait for the price to come down. They aren't taking me on some chopped up edits for $200.

I was doing some research and there is a Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum in Mansfield, MO that I would love to visit. They even have Pa's fiddle! :)",1289433600,4,1329,4.167315175097277

In the most helpful positive review, the reviewer asks ""what more do you want from these?"" Now, I can overlook the fact that the episodes are shortened, choppy versions of the originals. I can overlook the way the sound doesn't quite match up. I can even overlook the episodes missing--like the pilot! But when the majority of the discs won't even play--I have problems.

I tried my discs in several DVD players including my very expensive one, my cheap one, my laptop, my desktop and my Playstation 3. In most players the machine would struggle and ultimately report the disc unplayable. The nice DVD player played the menu, but the episodes would either refuse to play or would skip and freeze every 2 seconds until they finally froze for good.

I returned the whole thing and the next set I got was actually worse! So what do I expect? I expect to actually be able to WATCH the show. And this set is cute, convenient packaging...but ultimately defective.

DON'T BUY IT!

However,I am only giving It 3 stars. I am happy to have the whole series but IT NEEDS TO BE RESTORED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll keep this for now but will be happy to let someone else have It when they RESTORE and release IT again!! One thing I'd like to point out Is this.......It's much cheaper to by this set than to buy the series/seasons one at a time. I had 5 seasons when I bought this,and those 5 cost me over $200 bucks! I only paid $[...] for the whole series here on amazon. This set is loaded with tons of extras,pluse 3 TV movies.

We watch them practically every Sunday as a family. I had a bunch of the Little House video tapes from Time Life and they were exactly the same way. This is so much better though, because they include all the episodes and you can watch them in order. Also the Time Life ones didn't include interviews with the cast members like this does, which is really cool. If you enjoyed the version you used to watch on t.v. you'll enjoy this.

I was so excited to buy this set- I bought seasons 1-4- this release is the same disks. Anyway back to THE problem- the sound is not just bad- it actually is too fast!! I ran some tests because I noticed that Carolyn and Charles were sounding a bit like Mickey and Minnie mouse. It turns out that the sound was actually 1 FULL NOTE higher than it should be! Every episode of every disk is like this. I used some equipment to slow the voice and found that it truly was a full note in pitch too high.
Don't believe me?  WATCH THE CLIP THEY HAVE ON AMAZON.COM AND HEAR FOR YOURSELF.  Specifically- listen to Charles and Carolyn near the end of the clip--- it's ridiculous.  The kids voices are pretty high- so its not as noticable- but poor Charles- the man's man of all time- has been reduced to a high pitched weenie voice. I want his awesome manly voice back!

Listen- I NEVER WRITE reviews and I hate being negative about such a great show- but EVERY EPISODE is like this- and I care too much to remain quiet.",1261353600,29,1117,4.279620853080568

3555543,4,B001EL6ECM,"This is one of the best shows that ever aired on TV. I remember watching some of the episodes in reruns and it was hard to keep back the tears. The few episodes that I've seen so far is pretty good quality video and sound wise. The opening credits seem to missing on a few of the episodes-not really a big deal.

So why 4 stars? Well it's the packageing. I love the cover art work-the beautiful wagon-but cover art is no subsitute for stable packageing. I like the Binder idea-the abilty to turn pages like a book-each page has 3 dvds each-on the other side of the page is a short decription for each episode. While the binder idea is fine, The discs can fall out of the holders as you are turning pages-this causes scratches to appear on the discs and causes playback problems. You just need to be careful as you're turning pages-just push the discs back in the page to make them more secure. Even then, you still need to be very careful.

What you get is sixty discs of pure heaven! You get the all 9 seasons(though not the pilot movie-which is another reason for my 4 star rating), 3 movies filmed after the cancelation and 3 special feauture discs.

There's been a lot of talk about the fact the these appear to be edited syndicated versions. This does not really bother me. What I think happened is that the missing scenes are lost and haven't been found. This is not the fault of the company that released the dvds(though not including the pilot movie is inexcuseable)I agree with another reviewer who said it all depends on what you expect.

In spite of all this and the minor problems, no one can deny that this show is the best family show that ever was on tv. This show will move you-tug your emotions and put tears in you eyes.

So should you buy this set? Yes! Despite the weaknesses of the set and the packageing, The wholesome family entertainment is good enough reason to get this set.",1253577600,10,1900,4.386363636363637

This programme delivers quality in each and every episode. The stories always have a moral and of course good always prevails over evil. As well as entertainment it provides all viewers with good wholesome messages. This is of course the story of pioneer families in the 1800s in America. it lshows the hardships and trials and tribulations they faced. And the Olsen children - we still have them today. It is not religious or pious - just good old fashioned story lines. LHOTP has helped our very disturbed foster child settle down and learn the meaning of true values in life. We sit down as a family every Saturday evening and thoroughly enjoy each episode. The scenery is great, the quality of the discs is fantastic especially when you consider the age of the series.

So I finally just said to hell with it and ordered myself one and I was not dissapointed and I am very glad that I did.

It is fun to watch the Ingalls family adventures again, and my kids are enjoying it for the first time - the stories are timeless, and Michael Landon is such a good model of the patriarch of a household.

3555554,1,B001EL6ECM,"I'm not about to go over the seasons here. I will let it be known though that Little House On The Prairie is one of the greatest TV shows ever. It was a time where TV shows were innocent fun and anyone could watch it and not have to worry about foul language or some toilet humor.  A time where shows like Gilligan's Island, The Brady Bunch, Leave It To Beaver, were all seen on regular network TV on a daily run. Kids and family alike could enjoy!!  Gosh I miss those days of TV shows.

So let's get to the point of why this BOX set is so bad and a one star. Well it's simple, it's chopped up and cut to bits.  At least give fans the UNCUT version of the show. It's not like there are commercials to worry about and if you expect us to pay a couple hundred dollars to own the whole show, then put a bit of effort into it and at least give the true fans what we want. UNCUT!!!!

I'm not here to complain about the price. I'll GLADLY shell out plenty of cash for any show that I love, IF the company puts a bit of effort into taking the time to give me the real deal and not this edited down junk.  I'll put my cash towards another TV box set that is UNCUT and wait for the real deal here.  I refuse to pay for this set though, just so down the road the company can put out a UNCUT version and expect fans to pay again for this.

STOP BEING SO LAZY!!!  Give the fans what we want and we will gladly buy the set.  Think about it.  A fan of any show that is going to go out and buy the complete TV series of a show, is a REAL fan.  Do companies actually think that we want some cut down, chopped up nonsense as this?

WE WANT LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE IN A BEAUTIFUL BOX SET, UNCUT!!!!

I also purcheased the ""Little House On the Prairie"" Complete Series. I wish they would have included the three part ""Little House Years"" episode, from Season 5, to the Collection, instead of the audio commentaries from Allison Arngrim (Nellie). I am a fan of Allison Arngrim (Nellie), but it would have been great to have the ""Little House Years"" included. That is the three part episode from season 5, when the Ingalls family is gathered together for Thanksgiving. While the Ingalls family is sitting around their table eating pumpkin pie, Laura opens up her rememberance book and shares with Albert and Adam their move to Plum Creek, the ""100 Mile Walk,"" ""The Lord Is My Shepard,"" ""Bunny,"" ""the Race,"" and Charles remembers, ""Journey In the Spring.""

3555561,4,B001EL6ECM,"That's the question you must ask yourself before buying this complete series set.

For a number of years I have seen the individual season sets available and while I've been tempted on several occasions to pick them up, something had always stopped me.  Maybe I didn't consider myself a big enough Little House fan, or maybe I was a bit put off by some of the negative reviews I had read here about them, or maybe it was a little of both.  But when I saw the complete series out together in one place, I couldn't resist temptation any longer.

I'll begin by saying that those people who have complaints because of audio/video quality and editing have legitimate gripes.  If I were a Little House purist seeking complete, uncut, pristine episodes, I'd be more than a little disappointed, too. However, I'm not necessarily one of those people.  Yes, some of the episodes obviously have been edited a bit, and some of the episodes show their age, but not all of the episodes show these traits!  A great many of the programs appear to be in absolute pristine condition for this release.  As far as I am concerned, even the worst episodes from an a/v standpoint were not enough to hinder my enjoyment of the stories, nor were any of the edits that were made.  For the casual LHOTP fan who enjoyed the series growing up as I did, and wants to relive the stories, characters and places again, there is nothing here that is going to put you off.

Additionally, once you get into Season 5, the bonus interviews and special features included in the box set are quite interesting.  Alison Arngrim (Nellie Oleson) in particular provided some great insights into the show, and her audio commentaries on a number of the shows are often quite funny.  There are no less than three discs of bonus material that provide a wealth of behind the scenes stories and interviews, not to mention all of the bonus goodies that was included on all of the individual season sets as well.

The biggest reason why I am giving the complete series set 4 stars, aside from the previously mentioned a/v and editing ""issues"", is that the pilot episode was not included.  As far as I'm concerned, the pilot was as much a part of the series as the individual seasons were, and it's kind of a bummer that it has to be purchased separately in order to complete your collection.  I'm also a little bit disappointed that the 3 hour ""Little House Years"" special from Season 6 has been omitted from this release, but seeing as though it is primarily a ""flashback episode"", and those ""flashbacks"" are already available in their complete episodes elsewhere in the box, I can understand that decision to a certain degree.  My hope is that this show will see it's own release somewhere down the line, too.

Beyond that, I have never really been a fan of cardboard packaging for DVDs.  As already noted elsewhere, the discs are very easy to scratch if you are not very careful.  But with 60 DVDs to package together in this set, this is another decision I can understand in order to try and keep costs down as much as possible.

Bottom line:  If you are a purist who needs a pristine, uncut LHOTP experience, by all means avoid this.  You will not get your money's worth.  But for my money, I have been enjoying revisiting these old stories and characters again.  I haven't regretted making this purchase.  If nothing else, it has given me something to occupy my time on these long Wisconsin winter nights when there hasn't been a whole lot to do.",1231459200,265,3499,4.57784911717496
3555562,5,B001EL6ECM,"Nothing but outstanding things to say about LHOTP. I collected the entire seasons has they were being released. This is a must have for everyone. You gotta thank those people for all the teachings and see where we are at in the world today.

3555563,5,B001EL6ECM,"Unlike a previous reviewer, I wasn't looking for a perfect, unedited collection. The fact that the three TV movies that ended the series are included only enhances this collection.

Who has time to watch NINE seasons of unedited episodes? If you're going to pay good money for that, at least buy the remastered, enhanced F/X ""Star Trek HD"" series or something similar.

These are the episodes I grew up with, and I enjoy watching them over and over again. My all-time favorite episode is the first season ""Survival"", which deals with bigotry and an unexpected blizzard.

As for packaging, this is quite possibly the most EFFECTIVE presentation I have ever seen in a large DVD collection. Two small magnets hold a sturdy book together, and it opens up into an actual ringed binder. Each ""page"" in the binder holds 3 DVDs on one side, and a description of their contents on the other.

In terms of presentation, ease of DVD use, and description of the contents of each, this is easily the BEST setup for a collection (and long-term storage) I have EVER seen. Usually DVD packaging is pretty flimsy, but NOT in this case!

When I first bought it 2 episodes didn't work right off. I should have sent it back But I accidentally dented the box up a little bit when opening. (still I feel dumb now should have sent them back)

Other Issues
Sound with this particular set Very low Audio.
Video is not that great either It's better quality on Hallmark or INSP.
Very Edited scenes completely missing.

Yesterday I was watching on TV the episode where Albert's real pa wants him back. On my discs Laura never said goodbye to Albert
So about 2 minutes of chatting with him completely cut from these DVD's  Most of the episodes have scenes cut on this DVD that was only one

8298621,4,B001EL6ECM,"These comments are about the original box set from 2008, and not the reissue from 2011.

I have the original complete series box set, from 2008. The discs with the episodes are all the exact same ones from the previous individual season sets, and the bonus features are all on the same discs as before. They didn't make any changes at all; same menus, same picture, same sound, same bonus features...same cut down, edited syndication prints of the episodes. Seasons one and two still have the opening titles cut off on all episodes. And no, the pilot movie is not included, though the three post-series movies are.

The big lure of this box set for me was the inclusion of three discs of brand new bonus features. All the bonus features on those three discs were new to this set, and were dropped when the set was reissued with a lower disc count (when they also dropped the post-series movies as well).

The individual season sets had interviews with Dabbs Greer, Dean Butler, and Alison Arngrim, and Alison also did a few audio commentaries. The three discs of new bonus features in this set had interviews with practically everyone else from the cast who was still alive then, including Merlin Olson, Katherine McGreggor and Richard Bull. Alison Arngrim provided three additional commentaries, and there were a number of video featurettes, including one about the final show: The Last Farewell.

As I upgrade the series to Blu-ray now, I'll be keeping those three bonus feature discs from this box set...as so far, all those bonus features have not been made available anywhere else. (I had hoped it would all go on the Blu-rays, but alas, such was not the case.)",1456358400,,1666,4.7543252595155705
