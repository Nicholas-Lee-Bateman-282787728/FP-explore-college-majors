1047265,4,6305472459,"Several virtues make this atypical Valentino vehicle a true find for silent cinema buffs, Valentino buffs, cinematography buffs, design buffs, and especially those who appreciate restoration for video. Few nitrate-era  movies have enjoyed the luck of perfect original-negative preservation plus  the intelligence of perfect fidelity in the video transfer. This release is  at the opposite end of the spectrum from the ""fractured flickers""  syndrome, and is a rare indication of the technical and artistic heights  gained by Hollywood's silent golden age. For ""Cobra,"" William  Cameron Menzies (fresh from Fairbanks' ""Thief of Bagdad"") created  a family of four spacious and picturesque Mediterranean-style sets plus  what may be the first art deco set in any movie--a huge and stunning  nightclub set that's on screen for less than five minutes.  (""Cobra"" was released the same year as the Paris exposition that  introduced art deco.) Unfortunately, a third of the movie is spent in  other, bland sets. Cinematography ranges from intensely picturesque  (undoubtedly as conceived and created by the production designer Menzies)  to inept. The potentially magnificent look is undermined greatly by  mediocre, sometimes awkward or apathetic, direction. Could it be that the  budget was quickly consumed and shortcuts were instituted halfway through  the production? For once, Valentino (in real life an Italian immigrant  gigolo) plays an Italian immigrant gigolo, here named Rodrigo (strangely  similar to ""Rudolfo""). The character is deliciously ambiguous and  has none of the cliches associated with the Valentino image. The  performance is probably Valentino's most subtle, detailed and heartfelt.  Because of the paralells with the real Valentino and because this was his  first independent production, with deatailed and complex characterization,  I think the portrayal had strong personal overtones for the actor-producer.  All the more interesting because ""Cobra"" is almost universally  dismissed by biographers and film historians as a minor, throwaway project.  The narrative begins as a comedy (Rodrigo is a destitute aristocrat in  Italy, is a gigolo--the world's worst gigolo) but as he finds true  friendship with an American antiques dealer Jack, moves in with him in New  York, and gets caught up in a golddigger's (Nita Naldi) machinations, the  story ends up a grim soap opera. The confused screenplay is far more  interesting in what it suggests than what it delivers. The male characters  are richly non-stereotyped, but the women are, alas, either whores or  madonnas to the point of a misogynistic tone throughout. The new  chamber-orchestral score is appropriate and improves on some of the movie's  inconsistency. For variety, I like to play some Respighi selections while  viewing. Both for its weaknesses and for its remarkable, outstanding  strengths, ""Cobra"" deserves to be highly recommended.",939686400,44,2918,5.6077981651376145

1047348,5,6305472459,"Silent movies aren't predicable. You can't rely on a happy ending; you can't rely on them not knocking off the hero; sometimes you don't even know who the hero is. That's what makes them such fun. There is a flashback in this movie which makes the whole movie worth watching -- Rudolph Valentino as a 15th century nobleman with women trouble. It's a hoot. ""Cobra"" has a surprise ending (at least for me) so at odds with movies of today when you know in the first reel what's going to happen because they're so formulaic.",1356825600,4,520,4.484210526315789
1047349,5,6305472459,"I watched ""Cobra"" this weekend (had viewed segments of it on YouTube previously).

Loved the sets and the ladies outfits....Valentino's wife, Natacha Rambova, might have had no money-sense but she most assuredly could design.

Loved the story and the acting. I particularly enjoyed the night club setting and Valentino's response to the little note the waiter brought.

My son, having pulled up a site on the internet about the movie, noted that Rambova had a small part as a dancer in the film.  But I could not find her.  I know (having viewed a photograph in Hill's ""Silent Idol"" of Valentino talking to the girl who was the Cobra dancer) so where was Rambova?

If you are a Valentino fan, this movie is a must have.",1346112000,2,719,4.666666666666667
1047350,4,6305472459,"Valentino is great in this film. HIs acting is far more natural than it was under the earlier directors, and he has a feel for this character, perhaps the only Italian character he ever played.",1338595200,,193,4.542857142857143
1047351,5,6305472459,"I had read the book ""Cobra"" based on the film with Rudolph Valentino.  It was in my mother's collection and I had thoroughly enjoyed it.
Was really interested in seeing the film and languishing over Rudy's looks.  He was a good-looking man. Rudolph is a really good actor and a restrained one for a silent movie actor.  He gains your sympathies and you empathise with him. His character changes over the course of the film and he does this expertly.  Enjoyed the film immensely.

1047352,5,6305472459,"slow start, but great movie with all artistic control in the hands of his crazy wife.  Knowing what they spent getting real antiques, It is no wonder the studio heads were pulling their hair out, as they are almost never seen and play no part in the story.",1219017600,,256,4.333333333333333
1047353,4,6305472459,"The 1925 COBRA was among Valentino's last films--and it tends to divide the star's fans, who either rejoice at his appearance in a realistic drama or yearn for something that rivals his earlier, often outrageous seductive melodramas.

The story concerns Count Rodrigo Torriani (Valentino), an impoverished Italian nobleman with a penchant for torrid affairs that lead to endless and often monetary difficulties.  Largely in order to escape such difficulties, Rodrigo agrees to work for American antiques dealer Jack Dorning (Casson Ferguson)--only to find himself little better off in New York, where he wavers between office secretary Mary Drake (Gertrude Olmstead) and Jack's femme fatale wife Elise (Nita Naldi.)

In a stylistic sense, COBRA shows what Valentino could do as an actor when he was not encumbered by the usual ""great seducer"" scripts pressed upon him--and he acquits himself very well.  The supporting cast, most particularly Naldi, is also excellent.  But there is no two ways about it: COBRA is so low-key that it feels excessively slow as it moves toward its none-too-surprising conclusion.

The film itself is beautiful to the eye.  Valentino is very close to the height of his physical appeal and Naldi is stunningly beautiful in a series of Adrian-designed gowns; the art direction by William Cameron Menzies is excellent, and the cinematography by Fischbeck and Jennings has a velvety quality that is quite fine.  Even so, and with a running time of just over an hour, COBRA feels excessively languid in tone. The DVD offers a handsome transfer and good music score, but little else.  Recommended--but primarily for hardcore Valentino fans.

1047354,5,6305472459,"This really is one of those underrated things that you can't honestly or accurately judge or rate after just one experience.  Something underrated, be it a film, book, or album, really needs to be given at least one more listen, viewing, or reading before it begins to grow on you and you can fully appreciate and like it.  It's not one of those things whose instantaneous greatness hits you in the face the first time you see it.  It's also a rare stroke of luck that the original print of this film was in practically picture-perfect condition and looks as good today as it must have back in 1925.  I think a lot of biographers and critics tend to dismiss this film because it is so underrated, not something you can fully process after viewing it just once.  You miss a lot of little things if you don't go back and see it again before casting your final judgment upon it.  And, despite being a satisfying and well-told story, complete with very genuine and sincere and emotional body language and facial expressions (I agree with the other reviewers who mentioned that not only do you see every emotion, but you can feel it too, sometimes quite painfully), a lot of the things that made this a hit play when it was being performed onstage before being translated into a film version just aren't here.  Blame whomever or whatever you want for this, but a number of events important to the plotline happen off-camera, and thus the plot or story might not feel as developed or smoothly-paced to some people.  Everyone is great in this; they all did an excellent job with the material and how certain parts of the plot they could only do so much with because of how the Count's love affairs and fight scenes in the original play had to take place off-camera.  And what happens at the end completely breaks my heart; you can just feel how much pain Rodrigo is in when he realises what he must do, even though it breaks his heart to have to do this.

Since this was never a major film in its own right, the extras are typically very limited, to just brief biographies and filmographies of the major actors in the picture and of Joseph Henabery, who wrote the play on which this film was based.  I also was more than just a little upset by the ridiculous amount of time I had to wait for this film, far longer than the average time to ship given on the main page for the product.",1110240000,9,2376,4.426605504587156
1047355,5,6305472459,"No doubt everyone has a favourite Rudolph Valentino film for different reasons, and mine is ""Cobra"".  I simply cannot fault this film in any aspect:  visually beautiful with perfectly-suited, lovely classical violin music, and perhaps the most emotionally-rivetting acting performance by Valentino I have ever seen.  He manages to convey his emotions so powerfully that the viewer can really feel the emotions as well, and therefore relate to the character he plays.  Although Valentino was the 1920's greatest heart-throb and has been typecast as a gigolo and ladies' man, his role as a womanizer in ""Cobra"" is far from the superficial stereotype.  The film beautifully portrays a real person struggling with his emotions and predicaments, and in particular when it boils down to loyalty to his best friend.  The story has considerable suspense as  the viewer gets involved with the characters and their problems, wondering what the outcome will be.  There are some twists and turns that the audience might not expect, and which might explain why ""Cobra"" was something of  flop in 1925, but in retrospect this film counts as a shining example of the silent cinema. Add to this superb Valentino performance the role of the sensuous and seductive wife of the best friend, wonderfully played by Nita Naldi, who has played other similar 'vamp' roles.  To top it all off, there is the attention to detail in the beautiful sets, thanks to William Cameron Menzies, who also designed the famous Fantasy set for ""The Thief of Bagdad"", giving ""Cobra"" a feeling of style and elegance.  Overall, an excellent drama with some depth and a morale to think about, as well as simply visually enjoyable.",1083196800,17,1686,5.050541516245487
1047356,5,6305472459,"This film is a perfect example of why silent films have to be REALLY WATCHED without any distractions.  On first viewing, I was not paying full attention and I missed a lot.  This movie deserves full attention....to gestures, expressions, mannerisms.
While Rudy may not be quite as physically devastating as in his costumed roles, his acting is the showcase here.  And, this makes him even more attractive as a real person.  You can feel what he is thinking and going through and he draws you into the story (which is basically a morality tale).  And, what he is thinking and going through (even the comedy bits) appear very genuine and--it is the best word--heartfelt.  In the scene where he is being tempted to kiss his best friend's wife, just watch the emotion passing across his face....WOW.  The rest of the characters are well-cast and the sets and costumes (in one of famous designer, Adrian's, first movies) are fun to see in themselves.  But, it is the magic of Rudolph Valentino that makes this movie a rare treat.",1016064000,11,1025,4.751412429378531

This one was a very good old fashion love story, with good old fashion friendships that you don't seem to see today. This has to be my favorite movie of Rudolph Valentino...so far.

(Note: I bought the Silent Valentino Classics: Blood and Sand (1922) / The Eagle (1925) / Cobra (1925) (3-DVD pack set). Have only seen the Cobra far now...I may be re-watching it a couple of times before I watch the other two).

After enjoying the excellent Flicker Alley 2-disc ""Valentino: Rediscovering an Icon of Silent Film"", I bought the Blackhawk Films Collection/Flicker Alley version of ""The Sheik/Son of the Sheik"", and then, due to the quality of those DVDs, I purchased the Flicker Alley version of ""Cobra"".  It is digitally mastered at the visually correct speed of 22 frames per second from a full aperture mint condition 35mm master positive printed from the original camera negative. The music if from period arrangements recorded in digital stereo by The Mont Alto Theater Orchestra.

This is Valentino's 3rd to last film, but was released as his next to last, after ""The Eagle"" and before ""Son of the Sheik"".  While this is not his best, it was still enjoyable; I especially liked the cafe scene in Italy at the beginning.  He is an Italian count that comes to the US to work at an antiques company owned by the father of a gentlemen met in Italy, that becomes his best friend. All the ladies are after him, including his best friend's wife, Nita Naldi, who was also in ""Blood and Sand"" with Valentino.

7891508,3,6305472459,"As I wrote in a similar review, the movie itself, and Valentino's acting, were good. The print, however, lacked detail, like it had been dubbed too many times, maybe it was the best available. The background music was pretty good, orchestrated, but unfortunately spoiled by being played by a synthesizer. When I watch a vintage movie, I would like to hear authentic background music, piano, organ, or small orchestra, and not something that obviously comes through an electronic instrument that wasn't invented until decades later. With a film of this historic import, don't you think they could have spared a few dollars more and hired real musicians?",1390089600,3,652,5.102803738317757
