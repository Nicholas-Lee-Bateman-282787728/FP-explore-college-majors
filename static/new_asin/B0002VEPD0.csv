2124105,1,B0002VEPD0,"I bought this item thinking that it would be interesting to see how the conservatives communicate to their base.  But what a yawn this DVD is!  The only point they make through the whole thing is that George Bush is a religious man, which they hammer over and over again, as though we didn't know that already.  No in-depth look into how this specifically affects his policy-making both here and abroad.  Plus, the re-enactments are just plain dumb and the overall production is poor.  Basically, a transparent ""documentary"" offering no substance at all.  The Frontline documentary ""The Jesus Factor"" is far more informative.",1098403200,31,625,5.019417475728155
2124106,4,B0002VEPD0,"Yes, I own this video, and have watched it several times. It is a documentary produced independently of the Bush-Cheney groups, so it does not have a one-one-one interview with the President. It does, however, include interviews with people that have worked with or known George W. Bush. They all attest to the affect that a personal faith in God has made in the President's life from age 40 on, especially in regard to his drinking problem.

Even though I watch news programs regularly, I had never seen footage of the President like this--perhaps because it was not considered 'news' that an American president attended church or prayed in public. This video goes into the President's private life, and shows the consistency of his personal faith day to day...not just when the news cameras are rolling. President Bush is also seen with the firefighters and police at the fallen World Trade Center, and addressing the U.N., where he calls the leaders of the world to stop the sex-trade and abuse of women and children.  But the video is not all pro-Bush...it includes public comments from anti- Bush and anti-Christian leaders to balance the documentary. Some scenes from the President's life are re-enacted by Bush look-alikes as well.  Overall, it's good basic information on the personal faith of George W. Bush, as well as insight on the faith of earlier US Presidents: Reagan, Lincoln, Washington and the founding fathers, who also trusted in God to guide them, and to help preserve America's freedom of religion.",1097107200,4,1520,4.9763779527559056

The lighting alone is an insult to any true Christian.  To those who believe George W. Bush when he talks so much about his Christianity, I have two questions.  Who would Jesus bomb?  Who would Jesus torture?  Another couple questions not addressed in this production...just where in the Bible are we instructed to kill for profit...to send young people to war as a first resort and to lie to accomplish our goals?  This is propaganda...a must see for anyone interested in the manipulations and machinations of the religious right...the most truly UN-Christlike people on this planet.",1097107200,79,741,4.92741935483871
2124108,4,B0002VEPD0,"YES, I have seen and own this DVD. This video is a docu-drama, which means some of the scenes from George Bush, Jr.'s life is re-enacted. But the best footage is taken straight from stock media footage of Bush before his election as President. (It says at the beginning of the video that the production was done independent of the Bush administration, so there are no actual interviews with President Bush, or people currently in the administration.)

But I saw a side of Bush that the news media usually doesn't show news watchers--and I'm all over the news and talk shows, and web news sites every day as part of my job.

People close to Bush talk about his faith in God as a positive change agent in his life--especially when it came to overcoming alchohol addition.  There are also Bush critics comments taken from the public record for balance.  I'd say that  this is an alternative view of George Bush, Jr., when compared to Fahrenheit 9/11--but it is NOT a rebuttal. However, on the 70 minute DVD version, there is a blow by blow of F9/11, along with some interesting documents showing how many other American presidents exhibited their personal faith over the years.  Good basic info on Bush, Lincoln, Washington, and the faith of the founding fathers.--Gary",1096848000,36,1266,4.757990867579909
2124118,1,B0002VEPD0,"Unintentional comedy.  The people who made this ""documentary"" should be ashamed of themselves.  The Bush administration is the most spiritually empty group of profiteers I have ever seen.  And I am not an atheist.  I believe in God.  I believe George believes in God.  I also believe he will go down in history as a lesson to future generations about the dangers of unchecked power, arrogance and greed.  If I set out to make a satire on the GOP and it's pact with organized religion, it's distortion of what true compassion is,  I couldn't have done a better job.

2124119,1,B0002VEPD0,"As a non-American interested in the complex relationship between DC politics and religious conservatism, I had hoped to gain some general insight into the major themes invovled, such as just how much Bush's grasp of world events is conditioned by religious messages. Unfortunatlely this DVD has the sole intention of reassuring the converted, catering to those who already believe that a Christian faith is a pre-requisite for effective government. I might suggest that any 'critical' piece about religion in government must at least acknowledge the historical debate about the relationship between church and state; this piece of mindless propoganda is so limited that it doesn't recognise even such basic starting points for debate. Anyone who doesn't know their history is condemned to repeat it, and this DVD is proud to ignore such subtle points in favour of a few facile messages. Avoid.",1147219200,9,893,5.295774647887324
2124120,1,B0002VEPD0,"This DVD is bad enough to convince me to write the only review I have ever written. It seems to be intended for a really uninformed audience of beneath average intelligence. The dubbing of G W Bush (God Bless his deceased intellect) is atrocious and painfully ""door to door"" salesman in it's presentation.

The documentary rambles on in the most horrific and laborious monotony of a preacher suffereing from an overdose of anti depressants and the only message appears to be an extremely unconvincing argument that the current President is the absolute epitome of Christian graciousness and self suffering.

What absolute rubbish. Anyone who finds this work of any interest or value really does deserve to be forced through the entire excrutiating experience of watching the film from beginning to end.

The only thing I liked about it was the relief that it was not too long and that it did, EVENTUALLY, come to an end.",1140220800,8,920,4.884615384615385
2124121,1,B0002VEPD0,"I have never come across more disturbingly warped and disgusting drivel in all my life.

What an awful insult this DVD must be for all those many intelligent and educated Christians. Heck, even just the barely literate ones for that matter!

My perception of the American White House and it's respectability are ruined forever. This book makes it impossible to think of the White House again without associating it with something awfully wanting, with strong feelings of a loss of that proud institution's dignity and its intellect.

I walked away from this DVD wondering whether our popular news and/or entertainment media would ever return to that standard which might again be embraced by the average person of at least average intelligence.

For a while, after watching this DVD, I could not shake off the disturbing feeling that the producers deliberately attempted to rape the viewer's intelligence raped.

Coming from a man, such as myself, who can endure Rowan Atkinson for hours, this experience presents a particularly bad state of affairs.

What could the producers have been thinking? To halo polish and pompously pronounce the religious qualities of an intellectually impaired, idiotic, warmongering liar like GW Bush, and to compare him to those of real faith, like Mother Theresa, is simply far too much for any human mind to tolerate. How embarrassed I feel for my christian friends.

I literally felt disturbingly nauseous after this movie. The thought that there are actually some of our American cousins out there who really do believe some, and perhaps even all, of the filthy distortions in this DVD is quite horrifying.

Don't bother with this one folks, you'd be better off with a really bad porno copy of Enid Blyton's ""Noddy and Big Ears"" or that great American classic, ""My Pet Goat""",1139529600,6,1809,5.046979865771812
2124122,4,B0002VEPD0,"What a concept...

A documentary that suggests the president has transformed his life and found personal faith.

If you believe this usual rabble the president must be lying - though they are quick to defend the master of untruths 'that depends on what your definition of is is'.

The DVD offers an overview of the president and the importance he places on religion in the white house, such as the use of prayer.

2124123,5,B0002VEPD0,"All of the men who possessed the Presidency of this nation during a national crises have been men of faith and have not been too proud to turn to prayer themselves, or to call the nation to prayer.  This is NOT a coincidence.  God has placed those men in leadership of this nation BECAUSE they would humble themselves and turn to Him for strength, guidence and direction.

Bill Clinton in his stupid self-serving whining has said that he was robbed because nothing happened on his watch to raise him to great heights as President.  It was God who pulled together in thirteen small colonies the wealth of knowledge, determination and God fearing men who seperated this nation from England and inspired those men in writing the documents that guide this nation.  It is to God that we owe our freedom; it is He who gave it to us.  This nation is special unto Him; and those who detract from that idea make that idea no less true: therefore, Bill Clinton was removed from office before the nation was thrown into crises because Bill Clinton was not a man of faith in God, rather a man who trampled God and His teachings underfoot.

This DVD sets forth in the words of men and women who knew W. and saw with their own eyes the change that faith in God wrought upon W..  These are ""eyewitness"" accounts.  Even these first-hand accounts will never satisfy W's detractors; yet again, no matter how many times the detractors try to muddy the waters, it makes no change in the truth that W. is a man of God, a committed man of Faith, and a genuinely good person who is seeking God's will in helping others.  Maybe, just maybe this is the reason W. has so many detracors.  I, myself, have often thought when I hear W's detractors going on: ""I think thou protesteth too much.""",1126310400,11,1764,4.48125

2124125,5,B0002VEPD0,"The idea, as I have always learned it was:

""freedom of religion.""

not

""freedom from religion.""

Many of the first colonists came here to get away from religious persecution. That George Washington didn't mention God or that Madison wanted separation of church and state does very little toward indicating that George Bush is radical in proudly worshipping however he likes.

In fact, it's a very American thing to do. The right to worship or to not worship, without fear that that will disqualify you from all rights of citizenship is one of the key rights the war of independence was fought for. If there is a large body of Christians to whom Bush appeals because of his religious faith, it is their legitimate right to vote for him. It's called Democracy. If someone wants to make a film about why his faith is important to them, they should have the right to do so. It's called Democracy.

2124126,5,B0002VEPD0,"I watched this on cable the other night and found it to be so interesting that I decided to order a copy to have.  I find it a comfort to know where the President stands and where he takes his counsel from.  That he openly communicates with God and has no need to hide it.  I find that the people who criticize this action are afraid and fear is always a result of ignorance.  If you know God, than you understand that it is not the President who seeks more power and more glory, but he humbles himself to the one power that can change lives.  All of the great and effective leaders of this country, from the beginning, took their counsel, unashamedly , from God.  I enjoyed hearing the history related in this piece.",1120694400,16,717,4.274074074074074
2124127,1,B0002VEPD0,"This film supports a scarey trend that innores historical fact.

Madison was the principle author of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. His ideas were clear on what influence religion should have in government on visa versa. This separation did not even start with the Bill of Rights but rather are directly specified in Article VI, Section 3 of the Constitution itself where it states that officials of the federal government or the states ...""shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.""

That was a very specific statement, no test required. You can be not only a Jew or a Catholic, but even an Atheist. In fact, the Preamble of the Constitution starts with these words, ""We the people in order to form a more perfect union..."" Oh my God, that is the language of 18th century Social Contract Philosophy. ""We the people,"" not ""we with God's almighty hand."" In fact, God is not even mentioned once in the Constitution. This fact was debated in nearly every statehouse that voted for ratification of this Constitution. It was a controversial topic of the day. In addition, it passed the muster of the time.

When George Washington gave his inaugural address he never mentioned Christ or even used the word ""God"". Nowhere in letters to any of his associates or friends throughout his life does the name of Christ ever appear. Historians believe his religious belief to be that of Deism, yet we are bombarded with his image praying.  When Washington hired a bricklayer for his Mount Vernon estate, he remarked, ""If they are good workmen, they may be of Asia, Africa, or Europe. They may be Mohometans, Jews or Christians of any Sect, or they may be Atheists.""

Madison was so against the connection of state and church that he opposed the appointment of chaplains to Congress. Madison warned us about men like Bush who abuse the public pulpit stating, ""Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it, needs them not. Such a government will be best supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his religion with the same equal hand, which protects his person and property; by neither invading the rights of any sect, nor suffering the rights of any sect to invade the rights of any other.""",1113609600,17,2465,4.845605700712589
2124138,2,B0002VEPD0,"Bush spends more time on his knees than any American president?  I didn't need to know that.  I could insert the obvious Lewinsky joke here, but since I'm not a drive-time DJ or 99.9% of the stand-up comics in America (or most of the guys you work with), I won't.

Instead I'll ask the question this little puff-piece crockumentary fails to answer:  So?  So George W. Bush prays.  So he's sincere in his beliefs.  So he is guided by his understanding of what Christ would do, or want done, in any situation.  So what?  I don't care how sincere he is -- he keeps doing bad things that hurt most (read: poor and middle-class) Americans.

Bush's conception of faith is so flawed it's remarkable more thoughtful Christians haven't called him on it publicly.  No matter how ardent your beliefs, if they're factually incorrect then that's that.  I can believe in my heart of heart that two plus two does not equal four.  Doesn't make it so.  But because Bush looked into his heart and ""prayed on"" whether invading Iraq was the right thing to do, we're now supposed to forget that the invasion was not only morally reprehensible but based on at least incomplete and very likely purposely skewed intelligence analysis?  Think I'll pass on that Kool-Aid.

Bush is the worst president ever.  That's pretty clear by now to anyone (a) older than 8, (b) not a member of the Bush family, or (c) who can and does read.  How much more evidence do we need?  Like when he said he looked into Vladimir Putin's eyes and ""saw his soul.""  This, despite Putin's increasingly autocratic and racist policies, including the continued oppression and murder of his own countrymen?  Or like when he said the jury is still out on evolution?  The evolution issue is so overdone - we've been having this argument for decades now, and some people just won't respond to fact.  But what no one ever attacks is the arrogance of these windowlickers who say it ain't so just because it doesn't square with THEIR conception of the text and meaning of the Bible.  Am I the only one who's insulted that these oxygen thieves don't believe God to be capable of creating the seeds from which life grew?  If God is omnipotent, why is there even a question as to whether evolution can be squared with Christianity or the Bible?  I'm supposed to believe God can create man out of dust in an instant, but not out of numerous genetic mutations over the course of millenia?  That's not a problem with my faith, folks; that's a problem with your ability to really grasp the concept of omnipotence.  Which figures: most of the people who'll enjoy this DVD have zero power over anything important, including their own lives.  But what's galling, and what keeps us Liberals awake nights, is that we have a president who can't grasp the concept.  What is faith without intelligence?

This DVD just adds ammo to the inescapable conclusion that Bush is a pious fraud.  From his fake Texanisms (your blue-blood Connecticut family spent tens of thousands of dollars to put you through Harvard AND Yale and you STILL can't pronounce ""nuclear""?) to his cynical and exploitative (see e.g. Terri Schiavo) religiosity, George W. Bush stops being sincere the second he wakes up.  He's a bigoted, myopic little child of privilege who should be given a gun and sent to fight alongside the soldiers he's thrown into the meat grinder.  I know he chickened out the last time such an opportunity dropped into his lap, but it's never too late.  Proceeds from this DVD could be used to buy him a one-way ticket to Fallujah so he can put that spiffy flight suit to use.  But since Bush has clearly played the Jedi Mind Trick on the filmmakers, that's not likely to happen.

So...why the two stars?  Because the ""Left Behind"" crowd will spend two more hours in front of their DVD players and two less hours picketing Planned Parenthood clinics.  Anything that sedates the farthest right fringes of American religion is good by me.  Plus, there's something kind of appealing about watching a puff piece on someone you just know is ultimately going to be shown for the charlatan they are.

And to stem the expected flow of hate mail:  I attend church regularly, am close friends with many evangelical Christians (though I am not one), including Bush supporters (ditto - duh!), and have made these same arguments to many of them.  Their usual response:  a shoulder shrug and a ""well, you just don't understand.""  Actually, I understand very well.  It's the Politics of Fear.  Say what you will about Bill Clinton; most of us who voted for him were voting for hope.  And that's a big problem: it's a lot easier to create fear than hope.  So people like Bush and Ronald Reagan will pop up from time to time, and our job is to hold our noses and try to keep reminding ourselves that This Too Shall Pass.",1113177600,17,4822,4.636363636363637
2124139,5,B0002VEPD0,"I believe the path to truth lies in seeing both sides and avoiding the extremes.  I was swayed by the 9/11 conspiracy theories in the beginning, but the more I studied the more I realized how wacky the views were and how unfounded.  Some even try to compare Bush to Hitler!  Bottom-line they give Bush and our Government way too much credit. So I decided to rent this movie that obviously supported Bush. I watched this movie and I cried.

Everyone that actually works in Washington or in a government organization knows that they are just not that organized...that is largely how the terrorists got away with what they did, due to the lack of communication between intelligence agencies.

So about the movie, I cried at the acts of kindness that I'd never heard or noticed reported in the media.  And I cried at the shame I felt for the hateful words I had said about Bush to many people around the time of the last election. I'm glad they didn't listen to me. I recognized that I had been only seeing what I wanted to see.

I feel strongly that if Bush weren't president another holocaust may have happened.  I feel that if Bush were president during the time of Hitler that the holocaust wouldn't have happened.  He would've listened to Winston Churchill.  He has prevented a new holocaust and prevented a new Hitler with his war on terrorism and taking Saddam and others out of power.  Regardless of your political views, if you are a believer in faith you will recognize that any person in such a powerful position could use some prayers that they will make the best decisions possible.

Bush does not claim to be lead by God, any examples of such are not verifiable and are projected by his enemies and yet even reputable anti-bush media outlets refuse to use such.

This movies is exactly what it claims on the cover a religious, pro-bush movie, I mean come on, the cover says ""His faith will inspire you!"" No surprise here, yet obviously the ratings on here are a bit polarized.

They may have exaggerated some things in the film. Bush has never claimed he was a prophet or received revelation from God.  He does however respect others religious beliefs much more than the other reviewers tolerate his.",1112227200,12,2210,4.6020408163265305

The last few years have seen what appears to be a fear from the Left of any spiritual expression (unless it is called ""Wicca"" or some other New Age derivative), and socialistic and secular organizations like the ACLU have been seeking to strip the country of all traces of religion, while on the same stage of destiny, there is a president of genuine faith, who is trying to stem the tide of removing God from all things American, resulting in a genuine culture war, labeled in the recent 2004 election as a ""war of moral values"".

As President Eisenhower is quoted as saying, ""Without God there could be no American form of government nor an American way of life. Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first...the most basic expression of Americanism"".

Bush on God and Country"". It also includes comments from ""the other side of the aisle"", including Al Franken, Richard Gere, and Ralph Nader.

The early part of the film has re-creations featuring actors playing the Bush family, which give it a semblance of the stories on the ""700 Club"", but it also has some wonderful still photographs of the family when ""W"" was a youngster.

Whenever US had some fine president, they got him killed like Kennedy, or impeached like Clinton, and then think that someone no woman would like to fool around with will be up to the job. The father's limitation was he couldn't do two things at the same time (for example stepping down some stairs and chewing gum). I was not sure the son can even do one only thing at all, but now I am, except anyone thinking that getting US down the drain can be regarded as a great achievement (except for those who still believe God is really pleased with suffering, and who were many enough to ask for four more years in misery). But, at least, this family is faithful to their beliefs, since the son could not think of anything else but to resume the war started by the father, and, this time, only demonstrating that it's the sheer opposition of two fanaticisms resulting from the complete dedication in superstitions based on dogmas they pretend to be religions. If God did exist, he sure would have stopped this kind of crap long ago....",1099699200,25,1178,4.509345794392523
2124147,2,B0002VEPD0,"As the title of this work implies, this documentary attempts to give a general overview of role of faith in the Bush Presidency. It should be noted that the title does not indicate the nature of the faith, i.e. whether it is based on Christianity, Islam, Judaism, or the myriads of other religions in the world today. Therefore, it could be said that this work professes to a certain religious provincialism. Viewing it reinforces this opinion, as no attempt is made in the work to justify non-Christian influences in the Bush administration. It is the Christian faith, and that alone, that gives moral legitimacy to the Bush administration.

There are some astounding historical inaccuracies in the work, such as the assertion that Bush, Lincoln, and Washington are the only presidents to have to deal with war on American soil. The War of 1812 is not included, during which James Madison was President, and during which one had fierce battles in Chesapeake Bay and New Orleans, and of course the burning of Washington D.C. (which provided motivation for the writing of the Star-Bangled Banner). This omission sheds serious doubt on the credibility of this work, but evidently its purpose was not to engage in objective and accurate historical studies, but to justify the presence of the Christian faith in the higher ranks of government.

The narrator of this work asks the viewer to consider whether Bush is just another pandering politician paying lip service to the Christian faith. Every president the narrator claims has paid deference to and reference to God. She does not elaborate however, on just what the term ""God"" meant to each of these presidents. Their conception of God was highly variable, as a perusal of their speeches and writings will reveal. But the purpose of this work was not to engage in objective and accurate historical studies, but to justify the presence of the Christian faith in the higher ranks of government.

That this work believes that the Presidency is a divine appointment is clear from listening to the narrator, and that religious moral clarity is essential in a President. This need is apparent if one observes how much the churches in America were filled after 9/11, says the narrator. She does not give statistical evidence for her claims of the degree of church attendance, but the purpose of this work was not to engage in objective and accurate historical studies, but to justify the presence of the Christian faith in the higher ranks of government.

The narrator asks the viewer to consider whether a man of faith is more trustworthy as a President than one who is not (interestingly, she does acknowledge the possibility of a ""woman of faith""). President Washington is quoted as saying that one cannot govern without God and the Bible. This quotation (no references are given) illustrates the inherent bias in this work towards the Christian religion. Could an Orthodox Jew govern America sufficiently? How about a person of the Islamic faith?

The Christian evangelist James Robison engages in frequent dialog throughout the work. Bush has deep convictions, he says, but he would not deliberately manipulate others, does not make grandiose claims about his faith, and believes strongly in the power of prayer (which Robison adds, he never tries to hide). In addition, much discussion is given of Bush's childhood, and it is apparent that this work believes that his childhood experiences are relevant to the evaluation of the character of Bush. The discussion is completely at odds with other commentaries on Bush's childhood, which paint a radically different picture of it: one of an absentee mother and an aggressive and sometimes sadistic young man.

Bush, with the assistance of Billy Graham and James Robison, turned his back on his drinking habits and became a transformed person, according to the narrator. Prayer, she says, saved him from alcoholism. Other commentators, and some psychologists though, have pointed to the dangers of untreated alcoholism, and if their assertions are supported by evidence, it would become imperative that Bush seek medical treatment as soon as possible. Ironically, it is perhaps his faith that will dissuade him from seeking medical help, believing that he can deal with any personal afflictions via the ""power of prayer."" After all, Bush says, faith can change our culture, give us purpose, and change lives. The daily workings of his administration exemplify his convictions in this regard, for Bible readings and prayer are part of the daily routine at the White House. ""I could not do my job without prayer"", says Bush.

Thanks to Bush's emphasis on the Christian faith, all Christians can now be emboldened, says the narrator. His faith encourages all Christians to be open about their faith. That many Christians in the United States are emboldened is perhaps beyond dispute, and they are determined to bring about what they believe should be a more ""Christian America"", this being justified by the real intentions of the Founding Fathers.

These are developments that must be watched carefully by anyone desired to live in a free and open society, and also from a pragmatic point of view. The issues facing each citizen of this planet justify careful thought and respect for facts, not prayer. With respect to the behavior of many citizens after 9/11, it could be said that the last thing one needs in time of crisis is prayer. The ratio of prayer time to thought time should be a very small number, as the time spent on prayer could be more wisely devoted to policy making and evaluation. Religion must not be a personal crutch, as it seems to be for Bush. He apparently does not have the personal strength or a powerful enough intellect to deal with his own problems and the important problems of his Presidency. Robison quotes him as saying that God wanted him to run for the Presidency, that his country was going to need him.

But we need more thinking, not prayer.",1099180800,44,5972,4.975951903807616

8032717,4,B0002VEPD0,I home school my kids and wanted a video that would show them how Christian values in the White House are beneficial to our country.  I was surprised at how much I learned from this video.  I did not know a lot of how deep George W. Bush's faith is.  I enjoyed this video.  My 10 year old did as well.  It really got her interested in politics.  I am glad I purchased this dvd.,1312675200,,377,3.96

It boldly addresses the criticisms of well-respected men in our culture today with quotes from our nation's founding fathers, and other presidents. It gives a rich history of our nation's relationships with religion and its presidents. Very well-done-I highly recommend this film as a wonderful history of our president, George W.

But we should not forget, as a president ,G W Bush has to make decisions that under propaganda we may feel they are unjust; however, America has been safer and more secure due to his actions.

8032721,1,B0002VEPD0,"Watching this video, one is caught between the feeling of wanting to congratulate so many well-meaning, morally upstanding people for their religious faith in God and President, while at the same time wanting to dismiss this production as little more than cheaply made propaganda. I chose the latter, for the following reasons.

The opening message at the very beginning of this program reads verbatim on the screen: ""This documentary was produced independently and without any input from the White House, the Bush Administration or the Bush/Cheney Election Campaign. It is based on independent research."" You know right there what you are in for. From the very first spoken words of the program to the very end, the blessed virtures of George W. Bush are extolled and all critics of Bush are lampooned and ridiculed. This program relied 100 percent on opinions of those close to Bush (including family) and/or those who greatly admire Bush, and no research source whatsoever -- outside of the Christian Bible -- was noted anywhere in this program. This film may have been independent, but it is very far from being unbiased and unprejudiced.

Some people who are interviewed for this program, both the young boy and several other adults, appear as if they are reading from a script or being coached. In the ""extra interviews"" you can even hear the director calling ""Cut!"" from behind the camera.

Also, I bought this program in part for its billing as ""An Alternative Program to 'Fahrenheit 9/11'."" The ""extra features"" listing on the back of the case includes ""Responses to 'Fahrenheit 9/11'."" I was curious as to what rebuttal this program was prepared to give for the popularity of filmmaker Michael Moore's movie. The fact is that only a couple of passing references to ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" appear throughout the whole main program and the extra interviews, covering no more than a few minutes of the entire DVD. One gets the strong idea that this self-described ""documentary"" was created quickly and cheaply to plug up the growing leaks in Bush's sinking credibility in the wake of  ""Fahrenheit 9/11's"" popularity around the world. This film, ""Faith in the White House,"" would absolutely fail to convince anybody not to watch Moore's movie. In fact, it will probably encourage them to watch Moore's movie out of curiosity, if nothing else.

Then there is the content: George W. Bush is presented in this program as literally the Son of Man, and the rest of humanity is not to question his morals or his decisions. There is not one direct interview given in this program by anybody even mildly critical of Bush and his policies. The focus on Bush and his unshakeable religious faith in what he is doing is the focus throughout this program. Ours, as mortals, is not to question why. Never mind the utter corruption that runs rampant throughout this U.S. adminstration and its wars overseas.

Also, the program was more than a little dishonest in not labeling as a ""re-creation"" or ""re-enactment"" those scenes that show the newborn ""baby George W"" (aka ""baby Jesus"") in the arms of his mother Barbara (aka ""Mary"") and lovingly supported by father George H.W. (aka ""Joseph"") at the baby's baptism. There was literally a halo around the head of the young boy George W as he refuses to go out and play with a friend and instead stays home to comfort his mother. Then, there is the cheesy-looking actor portraying George W the man (where did they get those eyebrows?) as he turns down the ""come-on"" of a female campaign staffer who was probably put there as a spy by another political party to destroy Bush's credibility (aka ""Eve"" tempting ""Adam"" with the apple). There is no line whatsoever drawn between the actual file photos and footage of George W. Bush, and the dramatic recreations of his life -- some of which are quite hilarious.

The extra interviews don't do much better. Every single person, without exception, praises Bush for every single small act he undertakes and derides anyone else who may question Bush's motivations. One interviewee, for example, exclaims that Bush has quote-unquote ""an almost cosmic vision"" as president. Another interviewee lets a big one slip out when he notes that Bush's religious faith serves as the basis for how he would quote-unquote ""rule"" the country (not ""govern,"" but ""rule""). Are we to believe that America is the equivalent of the Kingdom of God on earth and George W. Bush is its ruler? All of the interviewees, who include George W's ""Uncle Bucky"" Bush, would certainly have viewers of this program think so.

In the end, this ""documentary"" left me with one overriding, inevitable impression: that while many individuals in the U.S. are certainly good people, America as a society has lost its moral compass entirely. That is the real issue to be addressed here. Americans as a people have lost any moral high ground whatsoever and are in no position to be wagging their Bibles, crosses, dirty money, crooked little fingers or anything else at the people of the world -- certainly not at people far away in the Middle East but not even at people in nearby Mexico or Canada. Americans of all religious faiths and social backgrounds need to get their own moral house in order now, and leave the rest of civilization alone while they are doing so. Good luck America, and let us know when you are done.

If you absolutely must watch this program, ""Faith in the White House,"" borrow it from a friend or acquaintance who owns it. Don't waste one penny on it. You'll only end up doing what many other Amazon buyers have done: reselling this new DVD back on Amazon as a used item at a much cheaper price. Which, when you think about, is the only moral thing to do.",1173744000,4,5710,4.830265848670757
8032722,5,B0002VEPD0,"During a time when the left is utterly consumed by hate for Bush and obsessed with bashing him, I found this DVD wonderfully refreshing and encouraging.  It reinforced my opinion that Bush is exactly where he needs to be.

Some of the liberals who reviewed this DVD took the opportunity to add a bunch of their own personal beliefs and opinions on a variety of things from the notion that Bush has lied to the idea that right-wing Christians are the most un-Christ-like people on the planet.  Hogwash.  They need to get down off their soap boxes and stick to what is actually in the DVD.",1166054400,9,587,4.509433962264151
8032723,1,B0002VEPD0,"The faith of George Bush?  He is certainly not a man driven by facts but his own warped convictions.  The real problem is Bush thinks he is God.  Or at the very least, he is God's personal favorite.  After all it must have been divine intervention  that rescued Bush from Alabama National Guard.

Never being part of the drug culture, I've often wonder how much coke it takes to make you believe your God.

Now it is a fact that Bush loved the nose candy during the seventies along with side order of beer.  He had admitted this much.

While Bush claims that Jesus is his role model, Bush is no Jimmy Carter.  With his actions in Iraq, our President seems to have made self centered Homer Simpson his role model.",1153267200,8,712,4.366412213740458
