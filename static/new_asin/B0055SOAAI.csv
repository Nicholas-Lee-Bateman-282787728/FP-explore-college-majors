4579878,3,B0055SOAAI,"My 3 year old son has been waiting for this DVD since seeing it on the Thomas the Train website. He loves it and has watched it everyday, sometimes more than once if allowed. He was not afraid of the fire scene or Diesel 10. He loves Diesel 10 actually and his claw. For me I don't like how much Percy whined or needing to explain what devious means but my son & my 6 year old daughter loves it.",1316390400,2,395,3.95
4579879,4,B0055SOAAI,"My son loves Thomas and Friends... and was very happy to meet two new characters!!!
Loves Flynn and Belle, as he is obsessed with fire trucks/engines at this time.
I did feel as though the story with the Diesels was a bit older though, as he was not really into it at first... Maybe a bit to ""deep"" for him?
But he has asked to watch it since then and likes it, just doesn't care for the Diesel crew!  :)",1316131200,,404,4.05
4579880,1,B0055SOAAI,"We were really let down by this. After watching either Hero of the Rails or Misty Island on an almost daily basis, we were all ready for DOTD to arrive. Both my three and two year olds were scared by the fires and by Diesel 10. They liked Belle and Flynn, but that's it. Percy is ridiculous in this movie and we had to explain why he was acting like a wanker. And then we have to explain being devious and lying and tricking one another - all conversations we had zero interest in having with the kids at their age.

Such a shame because we're all such fans of the Thomas line.",1316131200,11,577,4.106194690265487
4579881,1,B0055SOAAI,"I've only bought two of the newer computer generated Thomas DVDs, and while the animation is absolutely fantastic, with realistic train motion and details, this particular story left a lot to be desired.
This is NOT for kids 3 and under...it is simply too scary, the characters are too one sided (Percy is particularly annoying with his whining that nobody is paying attention to him) and the climax is a letdown.
There are really only 3 characters that get any lines...Diesel 10, Percy, and Thomas.  The start of the DVD is like a long commercial for two new firefighting characters...a water spouting steam engine named Belle, and a fire truck that has both regular tires for the road and railroad wheels for riding on the tracks.  That little story takes a good 20 minutes of the 55 minute running time, and there are no diesels to be seen while Percy whines that Thomas is too busy showing the new engine around the island.  What a sucky baby.
My son and I were disappointed that our other favourite engines...Henry, Gordon, James etc. had mere cameo appearances as they raced by on other tracks.  Edward was nowhere to be seen, Toby showed up in the final minutes to help the 'steamies' lead their gang-like rumble against the diesels who had taken over the steamworks.  I've seen better story lines, and more character interaction in the 5 minute shorts of the original series than in this entire 'movie'.  A real shame, as like I said, the animation is absolutely top notch.
This is not a story that kids will like.  Make it a rental, or better yet, wait until your local library has it and borrow it for free.",1315785600,35,1617,4.6328671328671325
4579882,1,B0055SOAAI,"My son loves everything Thomas the Train, but this video is just too scary.  He much prefers Misty Island, Hero of the Rails, etc. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come for the Thomas franchise.",1315699200,20,199,4.2368421052631575
4579883,3,B0055SOAAI,"I agree with the above review. My 3 year old loves the Thomas movies, but this one scared him, especially the Diesel 10 engine. He watched about half the video before making me turn it off.  I also thought the theme of the movie was a bit mature and geared towards older children. I will put this one away and save it for when he is a little older.",1315699200,3,348,4.043478260869565
4579884,4,B0055SOAAI,"My son is 3 and normally loves the Thomas movies (Misty Island, Hero of the Rails), but this movie was a bit scary for him.  I think it's Diesel 10 and his sparking claw that really scared him. I had to turn it off and try it again later.  We eventually got through it, but he doesn't want to watch it again (unlike Misty Island and Hero of the Rails which we've seen a lot).  The quality was really good, but it was a bit darker than the other movies.  If you have a 2-3 year old, you may want to wait until their older.",1315612800,44,521,3.933333333333333
4579915,5,B0055SOAAI,"I don't like the plot line personally, but my son loves it. Devious Diesels plan to take over the steam works and Percys naivety is how the plan comes to fruition. I guess it is a really good lesson to children not to trust just anyone.",1513209600,,236,4.1521739130434785
4579916,5,B0055SOAAI,"this movie was awesome, can watch over again",1510531200,,44,4.625
4579917,2,B0055SOAAI,"This movie was not very good. Diesel 10 is still as annoying as ever. He was fixed a bit after Calling all Engines but he was still not as good as in Magic Railroad. This version of him is motivated by the we are not loved thing. They should have done this with a new character. The new characters in this movie are Norman, Paxton, Sidney, Den, Dart, Belle and Flynn, Norman does not do much in the movie and does not do much to this day. Paxton does not do much either. He does more in Blue Mountain Mystery which will be the next movie to be reviewed. Sidney does not do much either but did get a episode to himself in the future in Sidney Sings. Den and Dart are good comic relief and are very good characters. It takes Den sometime the say something and Dart can read his mind. Flynn is awful and in season 15 he does not know if an engine is on fire and is very annoying. Belle is a useless character. Steam engines don't shoot water, FIRE TRUCKS DO! Belle is also ugly. I also liked and disliked Percy being the main character in the movie. It's nice to see someone else as the main character instead of Thomas. However Percy is so silly in the movie. Just because Thomas hangs out with Belle and Flynn does not mean Percy is no longer Thomas' best friend. no wonder Diesel 10 can use Percy so easily. I like the bit the shed at the dieselworks closes on Diesel 10 which was funny. I was glad that Kevin got a big role in the movie but that is not enough to save the movie from falling into the mediocre  category of the Thomas movies.",1505606400,,1541,4.136666666666667

4580100,1,B0055SOAAI,"I am an engineer, so I can share two basic facts:
- Steam engines burn twice as much precious fuel as a diesel engine.  That's why they were discontinued in the 1950s.

- Steam engines produce 1000 times more lung-damaging/ smog-creating pollution, because their smokestacks do not include catalytic converters or soot traps.  That's why the EPA has banned steam locomotives from American rails (except for historical recreations/parks).

Contrary to what is portrayed in this movie, steam engines are the True dirty grimy black-smoke-belching vehicles",1474761600,,552,5.458823529411765

4580103,5,B0055SOAAI,"First off, this is for kids... but since you are going to have to watch it with your child about a million times, it might as well be good. Of the Thomas and friends category, this is one of the best movies I've seen. One continuous movie with an actual plot that evolves like it should. You actually feel sorry for Percy. If you kid likes Thomas the Train, this will be a perfect film for him (and you... because you won't have to fast forward through the parts where the real train conductor just talks for 5 minutes like in the other films).",1473552000,3,544,4.240384615384615

Some of the scenes ARE a bit dark, and the way the Diesels manipulate Percy is really cruel. Treating him like a friend, luring him in just to get something from him, then turning their backs on him... was incredibly unkind. I can see how having to explain his behavior to impressionable children would be difficult. Also, Diesel 10's voice and facial expressions ARE very menacing.

I worried for nothing, though. Maybe it all just went over his head, but after my son saw this movie, he asked us to get him a Diesel 10 train for his TakeNPlay collection. I was shocked, because D10 is clearly a bad guy and a bit scary. For some reason, my son likes him.",1413504000,3,744,4.307142857142857

Sinister, slimy, threatening and frightening, Diesel 10 is the star of this show as he works with other diesels to keep Thomas and the other steamies from performing their daily duties and ""being useful.""

The fact that they chose to make the diesels so devious was a poor choice on their part.  Not all diesels are devious and manipulative. This movie pegged them out be so bad.

My theory in life is you don't have to make one party(diesels) look bad for the other party ( steamie) to look good.

4580533,1,B0055SOAAI,"It's to be expected that when a show runs for as long as Thomas, some of the storylines get a bit thin.  However, there is a difference between a thin storyline, which can be compensated for, and something that is so bad that one wonders why the project made it all the way through to getting made (well, besides trying to make tons of money off a successful kids' character franchise).

The plot begins with standard children's-story fare - Percy is upset that Thomas is spending lots of times with two new engines on Sodor, and so he's willing to listen to Diesel, who claims that the diesels really want to be Percy's friend.  That's fine, and it's a theme that not only resonates with children, but has successfully been done thousands of times over.

This, however, is not one of those times.  By the end of the movie, not only are there a bunch of plot holes and inconsistencies, but there are some fairly terrifying scenes (Thomas locked in a burning shed, for example) and in the end, it seems like the lesson is that if you are a bully, you might get a slap on the wrist, but in the end, you'll get what you want from people.",1378252800,2,1134,4.380952380952381

DAY OF THE DIESELS fits the bill!

Synopsis:  The threat of fires on the island of Sodor has prompted Sir Topham Hatt to have two new firefighting steam engines brought to the island:  Belle and Flynn.  Thomas' best friend Percy feels dejected after Thomas befriends the new engines; Percy no longer feels ""special.""  In turn, Percy decides to accept a dubious invitation from Diesel to visit him and his friends at the Dieselworks - a place that, according to Thomas, should never be visited by the steam engines because, in his own words, ""diesels can be devious.""  Arriving at the Dieselworks, Percy is surprised to discover that the facility is badly run down, dirty, and falling apart; it is the antithesis of the beautiful, clean, and shiny Steamworks facility.  At the  Dieselworks, Percy is greeted by Diesel Ten, the intimidating leader of the diesel engines.  Diesel Ten tricks Percy into believing that he and the diesels are his new best friends; Percy is then duped into assisting Diesel Ten with his devious plan to take over the Steamworks while all of the steam engines are away from the facility.  After the takeover, Percy realizes the error of his ways; he mobilizes the steamies with the intent to take the Steamworks back from the diesels, and a showdown ensues.  However, a last minute intervention on the part of Sir Topham Hatt resolutely resolves the matter, both putting Diesel Ten in his place and acknowledging the need for a new Dieselworks.  In the end, the steamies and the diesels work together to build a new Dieselworks (evoking a rare, benevolent smile from Diesel Ten), and Thomas and Percy resolve their conflict, reaffirming their ""best friends"" status.

Interestingly, a sub-set of critical reviews, (that have garnered significant voter approval), state that this movie is too scary for younger children, and that Diesel Ten is too malevolent a character.  Some of the people that wrote these reviewers even criticize the firefighting scenes as being too graphic for their children.
Admittedly, with his snapping hydraulic claw, large scowling face, and mischievous vocal intonations, there is no doubt concerning the villainous status of Diesel Ten.  However, it is these same qualities that also make him a memorable and unique character within the Thomas and Friends milieu.
For the record, my 5 year old son was NOT scared by this film; he absolutely loved the firefighting scenes, and stated that Diesel Ten is his favorite character in the movie! He also really liked the film's eponymous closing rock song (quite a radical musical change from the British children's chorus of the stop-motion era).  He periodically sang the song's chorus throughout the rest of the weekend.

As a final note, I'm also a little bit puzzled by the handful of reviews insinuating that DAY OF THE DIESELS is somehow promoting a ""wrong message"" to children.  I see this film as one that identifies a myriad of all too common human foibles/transgressions, effectively demonstrating to children the inappropriateness of these behaviors, and ultimately promoting the values of teamwork, honesty, and fairness -- We may deplore the general behavior of Diesel Ten, but via this character we are given a vessel in which we can discuss with our children the fact that not everyone does what is right; some people lie and manipulate others for their own means. Moreover, identifying such behaviors is NOT tantamount to promoting them; to the contrary I believe that DAY OF THE DIESELS effectively communicates that Diesel Ten's behavoir and actions are morally and socially wrong, and justice is ultimately served through the admonitions of Sir Topham Hatt.  Likewise, as adults we may find that Percy's emotional vacillations between self pity, jealousy, and anger over Thomas' new found friendships border on hyperbole.  Yet, again, all human beings experience these emotions at various points in their lives; the lesson taught through the exaggerated example of Percy is that overindulgence in such emotions can cloud our judgement, and lead us to potentially make poor or irrational choices.
While it may not be a particularly enjoyable task to discuss such things as conflict, lying, bullying, negative emotions, etc. with our children, the fact remains that these are ubiquitous realities that all children will eventually face; DAY OF THE DIESELS provides a platform for adults to discuss these issues with young children.

DAY OF THE DIESELS was a fun movie; my son very much enjoyed it, and I intend to purchase a copy of the DVD.  That being said, I also understand that every child is different; what frightens one child may have an opposite effect on another.  If your child has a tendency toward being very easily frightened, you may want to consider getting a copy of this film from your local library and sitting down with your child for an initial viewing.",1368835200,,5115,5.031990521327014

4580702,4,B0055SOAAI,"The animation is great.  The story line is pretty much boiler-plate for T&F (e.g. there is a special project (usually for someone important), a train disobeys and screws up, the boss gets mad and they fix the problem).  Generally speaking, this title does not deviate from that formula.

There is a lot of chatter in the comments about this film being dark.  I really don't think it's anywhere near as dark as some might let on.  My 2 & 1/2 yr old son and I watched this together and he didn't flinch at all (I expected he would as he becomes afraid every time when the trains get stranded in the collapsed tunnel in Misty Island, to the point where I fast forward through it).  To be fair, Diesel 10 does have a menacing laugh and does manipulate a depressed Percy to do his will.  If your child is sensitive to that (or if you are) maybe this title isn't for your family.

As for the comments suggesting racial undertones.. I personally would dismiss those outright.  However, I do think that social class discrimination and concepts of elitism are present in most of these titles (e.g. the Duke and Duchess, Topham Hat). I think the writers play that angle to establish chain of command (aka: listen to your parents, be useful, etc).

Anyway, my son enjoys the movie.

Both have watched this movie numerous times. I enjoy the thomas movies more than the other animated cartoons because i like the story telling concept that occurs and the island of sodor really showcases a ""different"" lifestyle... we live in the city so this is all very different for us- farms, rural areas etc.  Anyhow, some people have mentioned this being scary. HAS ANYONE SEEN SLEEPING BEAUTY RECENTLY? What about Snow White? We rented those and they were 1000 times more scary for my daughter than day of the diesels. Sure, DOD is not all rainbows and lollipops but neither is life, and at I feel comfortable having my kids get this type of introduction to the fact that people are evil and mean rather than an actual introduction to an evil and mean person when they don't even expect it. I want my kids to know asap that a lot of people are NOT nice. It is naive to raise kids sheltered in a bubble where evil doesnt exist, sorry but once they step outside not only are adults mean but so are kids! Id rather have my kids learn about evil from a thomas movie than from a real life experience.

I watch these movies with my kids. DH and I do not find it appropriate to over shelter our kids. We discuss their feelings, if they scared etc and try to rationolize their feelings- now we been doing this with our kids since they could understand and my kids never had nightmares or anything after watching TV- but we don't have cable, we only rent movies for the kiddos, so we have some control. I don't put on Friday the 13th for my 3 year olds but DOD has some good lessons in it, even if the least of which is that people are NOT always nice- that is a pretty valuable lesson for a kid to learn.",1331510400,,1753,4.24251497005988

Day of the Diesels is one of the newer CG animation movies.  My son doesn't seem to notice the difference, but I really like the old school stop animation movies much better.

The story is actually a little odd as well.  Percy feels left out so he starts to hang out with the diesels who ultimately end up betraying them.  Diesel 10 basically cons Percy and I'm not really a fan of that.  In fact, this Diesel 10 has no resemblance to the Diesel 10 first seen in Calling All Engines.  In Calling All Engines, Diesel 10 was scary and grumpy, but not at all evil.  In this movie Diesel 10 is a slick, slimy con artist.  Even more bizarre, after acting like an evil mastermind for the entire movie, Diesel 10 basically whimpers into a corner when Sir Topham Hatt tells him that he has caused confusion.  I get that the movie wants to show kids that he is apologetic and contrite, but it just comes off a sudden weird character change.

On the plus side, the songs in the movie are great.  There is a modern rock version of the classic Thomas song and a new Day of the Diesels song that's pretty catchy.",1328227200,4,1359,4.09469696969697

For young children something negative may be portrayed as a ""lesson"" to learn but in seeing that behavior in the first place a toddler-age child will emulate it so I don't want my kid seeing examples of evil and in this case in this film, potentially murderous (the fire) behavior AT ALL.

4580770,5,B0055SOAAI,"I was concerned when I read some of the negative reviews of this new Thomas video, but my 3 1/2 year old loves Thomas, and he especially loved ""Misty Island"" as a Blu-ray on my large-screen television, so I figured I'd get this. I was far more than pleasantly surprised, I was delighted by this short movie. In fact, I'm sure that writer Sharon Miller knew she was taking a big step with the story.

To summarize, Percy feels left out because he doesn't think that Thomas has enough time for him. Diesel (whom Thomas saved in ""Misty Island"") verbally seduces Percy to come to the Dieselworks and meet Diesel-10, who will be his friend. Percy is made to feel welcomed by the diesels, who desperately need a new Dieselworks (their's is old and dirty). The diesels, with Diesel-10 as their ringleader, get Percy to bring Kevin the crane over, and then they get Percy to bring Thomas to the dieselworks, where he is held hostage. Percy is then asked to bring the diesels to the Steamworks, which they take over and destroy. What will happen in the end?

The movie makes very important points about knowing who your real friends are, and that some people will make believe they are your friend, but will trick you in the end. Diesel-10's methods are in fact the same as leaders of gangs and other harmful groups; they look for children who don't have friends and want to belong to serve their own agendas. Diesel-10 reminded me of Fagan in ""Oliver Twist."" My son certainly understood this, as he told me the story in his own words just today.

Then they make peace and become friends. That is really what happens in the movie. Sounds weird but they executed the movie in such a beautiful way that my daughter could not stop talking about it for weeks. Yes, at the end friendship and mutual understanding wins but the scenes where Thomas was not let go by the diesels were somewhat inappropriate and unnecessary. I would recommend this movie overall, but watch it with your child(ren) for the first time and decide for your self if you feel comfortable with some scenes that might be stressful to some children (minus one star). I am also not amused with the fact that all conspirators/ill willed trains had a heavy accent (minus one star).

I guess it could be a little scary to young kids because the Diesel trains are portrayed as bad guys and there is that scary music in the background, but that's about it.  The DVD is a movie so it is not a bunch of short episodes either which makes it fun to watch.

The movie is about Percy feeling left out and joining the Diesel trains at the Dieselworks.  They make him feel special and convince him to help him take over the Sodor Steamworks.  It is a great lesson for kids that they shouldn't hang out with the bad kids just for attention or because they feel left out.  The Diesels were actually using Percy and trying to make Percy turn against his true friends.  Most of the other Thomas movies feature little lessons or troubles, and this movie really has a plot to it!  We were routing for Percy to realize Thomas was really his friend!  The other awesome thing about this movie is the two new firefighting engines - Flynn and Belle are in it and they of course have a fire to put out!

I mean...I can't even begin to understand what part of this movie would scare anyone.

For those whose kids were scared...do NOT ever watch the first Thomas movie (magic railroad)..your kids will have a coronary.  Diesel 10 is genuinely evil (and hilarious) in that movie.  He chases the steamies while clamping pinchy at them and threatening them.  At one point he traps James in a steel mill, trying to push him into a firepit...even that isn't ""Scary.""

Diesel 10 is the reason I give this 3 stars.  Diesel 10 is an awesome character in magic railroad, my wife and I actually actually quote him cause he makes us laugh.  Like when chasing thomas and lady to kill them he says ""i like my lunch steamed.""  And calls his sidekicks, Splatter and Dodge, ""Slodge"" because ""I don't have time to say both your names.""  And who can forget ""Diesel 10 had a farm.  With a pinch pinch here and a pinch pinch there.""

In this movie though...he is a complete dud.  He doesn't even call his claw ""pinchy.""  The whole personality is boring and sanitized.  After reading these reviews I am starting to see why.

One other thing I wanted to mention is this ""percy is whiny"" thing.  Have you people never seen the show?  The show is WAY more whiny. Percy's story is one a lot of kids shows deal with.  Your best friend gets sidetracked and your mind gets carried away and you start to believe nobody likes you.  I thought it was quite effective...although probably not understood  by 3 year olds.  But I think this could help a 4 or 5 year old understand how friends sometimes get busy but are still their friends.

Anyway, the movie was boring for me and my son actually wanted me to turn it off at one point because noooothing happened in the middle of the movie.  Even though weird and corny, magic railroad is a  billion times better.  I also liked the pacing and story of misty island and hero of the rails much better, my son has watched them a hundred times.  He already seems over day of the diesels.",1316995200,2,2174,4.4884910485933505
4580838,5,B0055SOAAI,"""This film is awesome,"" is what my five-and-half year-old had to say.  ""Not scary at all!""  He has been a huge fan of Thomas since he was 3, and could not wait to see Day of the Diesels.  I was reluctant to buy it based on the negative reviews, but my son begged, and he was not disappointed at all.  He was a little anxious that Percy was going to make the wrong decision, but did not think that the movie would cause nightmares.  ""Diesel 10 was wicked, but not scary,"" he said.  He loved the new characters, Belle and Flyn.  We thought the CGI was great.  He loved the movie so much that he asked me to write this review!  He does say though, that he does not think Day of the Diesels is a good choice for children under 5.",1316908800,2,725,4.049295774647887
4580839,4,B0055SOAAI,"My son is nearly 3 & couldn't get through this film without sitting on my lap, he gets so upset about Percy being 'naughty' and 'sad' I guess we'll be watching Hero of the Rails & Misty Island rescue for another 100 times again instead.

UPDATE November 2011:
I'm upgrading my review as my son has come to love ""the scary diesel movie"" as he calls it so much we now are limiting the number of times he can watch it. He really was terrified of it, but then we persevered and he's now asked for a Diesel 10 for his train set & he acts out him being bad & the other trains saving the day.",1316822400,4,585,4.0
4580840,4,B0055SOAAI,"This movie is Thomas & Friends' ""Empire Strikes Back"". Yep - it's pretty scary and dark at the beginning. Even creepy. We've watched it every single day since its release (kids are 3yo).

The first run through was a bit scary for my son. Since then, he's taken the opinion that Diesel 10 is not so scary. It has led to more discussion about friendly behavior vs bad behavior/bullying. I'm hoping that's what they were shooting for in this film since it is a lot more sinister than the TV shows. It seems like they've been building upon this theme of antagonists since Hero of the Rails (Spencer, the wacky logging locos in Misty Island, etc.).

I've only seen clips - but Diesel 10 looks a lot more scary in ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad"". In this one he's just creepy scary not destructively scary.

I like that the focus wasn't on Thomas. Percy's growth through the story is a life lesson. The two new fire-fighting engines feel a bit marketing-department contrived. For all the haters - has anyone seen a Disney film? Most of 'em have scary parts, too.

And I don't think Alec Baldwin is in it at all, Amazon.",1316736000,2,1113,4.4950495049504955
4580841,1,B0055SOAAI,My grandson actually had nightmares after watching this. He trembles at the sight of the package cover. It's not the story itself that is scary to him. Not the fire. It is the sinister and scary character Diesel 10 and his giant snapping claw! I would not recommend.,1316563200,7,266,4.5625
4580842,5,B0055SOAAI,"I have a 3.5 year old and I was worried after seeing the reviews on here that the movie would be too scary for my son. We watched the movie and there wasn't a time he wanted to turn it off. This has been the case with some children movies he has seen on TV. I wanted to write this review for those parents that were put off by some of the other reviews. There was a darker tone than Misty Island Rescue, but I thought it was a theme my son could grasp.",1316476800,11,452,3.8191489361702127
