3761267,1,B001PUTN3Y,"I watched this when it aired on PBS, I'm so glad I didn't buy it.  The acting isn't that great and the actual story has been horribly changed.  In fact it's so reduced it's not even an hour long!  And the ending!  SPOLIER ALERT!  I can't believe they had Heathcliff kill himself, that is completely out of character for him.  It's just awful!  Don't waste your money on this version.  I think the Ralph Fiennes/Juliette Binoche version is much better.  Fiennes makes an outstanding Heathcliff.  The only thing this movie can boast of is the scenery/settings but that certainly can't save it from the ruin that was made of the story.",1233100800,16,632,4.612612612612613
3761268,4,B001PUTN3Y,"Director Coky Giedroyc provides the newly thrice-spliced Masterpiece Theatre with a two and a half-hour remake of Emily Bronte's Gothic classic, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wuthering-Heights-Signet-Classics/dp/0451529251/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wuthering Heights (Signet Classics)</a>"" that adequately depicts the passionate love/hate relationship made famous by Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff for readers since 1847.

I have not had the pleasure of rereading the novel for a few years, but this adaptation seems remarkably true to the overall spirit of the story.  It includes the two generations of Earnshaws and Lintons most noticeably removed from the 1939 film version starring Lawrence Olivier as Heathcliff and Merle Oberon as Catherine (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wuthering-Heights-1939-Classic-Black-and-White-with-Original-Theatrical-Trailer-Import-All-Region/dp/B0011FV87C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wuthering Heights 1939 Classic Black and White with Original Theatrical Trailer (Import, All-Region)</a>).  The non-linear time sequencing of the film's plot mirrors the timeline of the novel; the only real difference here is the absence of the novel's first person narrators, Mr. Lockwood (Heathcliff's tenant) and Nellie (housekeeper of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange).  Giedroyc's version employs a third person technique in both the flashback and present day storyline to retell the Earnshaw/Linton history rather than rely on the biased comments of Bronte's storytellers.

Lockwood's absence also means the sequence of events revolving around the apparition of Catherine's ghost does not move the plotline.  Instead the opening scene treats us to a vengeful Heathcliff, manipulating his sickly son Linton's marriage to the second generation Catherine, daughter of Edgar and his love.  In fact, the entire aspect of the supernatural is not touched upon in the film as intensely as in the novel.  Heathcliff yearns for his dead companion, and participates in a ghoulish digging up of Catherine's corpse.  In a fantastic feat of cinematography the audience is privy to two vantage points:  Heathcliff's vision of her--young and fully fleshed as if alive--and then the gruesome reality seen from behind Heathcliff's back--Catherine's decomposing skull.  This film emphasizes the real and the gritty rather than the ethereal.

Similarly, it includes some passionate and psychologically intense moments that add carnality to the overall telling of the story that fits well with and enhances the wild emotions portrayed by Bronte.  Heathcliff and his Catherine consummate their love on the moors; Edgar desperately makes love to Catherine in their marriage bed and Heathcliff commands that his wife not look at him as he takes her after their impromptu elopement.  Somehow these moments add drama and needed adult content and motivation to what the other adaptations skirted around.  When Heathcliff realizes that his woman has slept with Edgar, his anger boils over with helpless indignation.  He wants revenge and after witnessing his closeness to Catherine, the audience sees him more as a jilted second choice despite his accomplishment; the face of the gypsy orphan still stares back at him.

Not that actor Tom Hardy resembles a gypsy in any way. His incontrollable mop of dark brown hair flops annoyingly onto his face; it definitely could use a trim or a ribbon holding it away.  Nevertheless, he does the character of Heathcliff and the Byronic hero justice; he most decidedly reigns supreme in the scenes in which he participates.  His passion seems almost Pilate-controlled from a steel core that is both practical and functional within the constraints of his world.  However, like the novel's character, he loses himself frequently with a cynic's paranoia that lashes out with the intent to destroy whatever is in its path.

Cathy, on the other hand, as portrayed by Charlotte Riley has a feral beauty that aptly suggests the novel's heroine.  However, Riley's Catherine has been ""de-bratted""; the novel depicts Cathy with a nasty selfish streak while this Masterpiece Presentation shows us a confused child/woman that indeed does what she chooses but then seems at odds with the results.

Isolation plays a big part in Bronte's novel.  However, this film fills the screen with an assemblage of others that makes the entire presentation more real.  Rather than just the dire foursome and their progeny, villagers, church-goers, barroom card players and fighting children add authenticity to the period and in comparison more starkness to the actual footage shot on the moors.

Bottom Line?  The 2009 presentation of ""Wuthering Heights"" created for Masterpiece Theatre Classics smolders with a raw sexuality and practical strength that will probably not please most purists.  Nevertheless, the film's team put together a good adaptation that brings the feel of the novel to life without imitating other film presentations of the past.  Recommended.

3761269,2,B001PUTN3Y,"This is a modern attempt of showing this interesting story on film and the director took too many liberties with it. The sex scenes were unnecesary and unfortunately show BBC's attempt to spice up the stories, but what they don't get is that these are great stories with implied sexual content that we don't need to see! Leave something to the imagination, please. Remember the opening minutes of the new Sense and Sensibility? Same thing. Completely unnecessary to the film (but I liked Sense and Sensibility). This version of Wuthering Heights was just too much. Heathcliff's demise was the straw that broke the camel's back. My overall impression of this version was ""blah"".",1233100800,8,677,5.0
3761270,3,B001PUTN3Y,"Based on all that has been written on the blogs and discussion boards, this latest production of ""Wuthering Heights"" has certainly incited passions about the changes and omissions from the book (such as how Catherine's explanation of why she will marry Edgar unfolds and numerous other tweaks to the story). Personally, I thought the narrative thread was disjointed, which makes it somewhat hard to follow unless one is already very well acquainted with the book. In this respect (and for this reason alone), I prefer the previous Masterpiece version from 1998. In that production, the story was told in a more linear fashion, which established important facts that led to greater character development (especially considering the time compression necessary for a two- or three-hour movie). A case in point is Heathcliff's discovery that he has a son, Linton---this scene, which explains a lot, is absent from the 2009 production. Having said that, the cinematography is powerful and on a par with the recent production of ""Tess"" and the 2006 adaptation of ""Jane Eyre.""",1233100800,4,1069,5.184971098265896
3761271,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I, too, am an English teacher and I was far more impressed with this version than the earlier (1998?) BBC version featuring Matthew Macfadyen. The earlier version was choppy and the characters were protrayed with little or no dimension--it came across as very fake, like an old Japanese sci-fi flick.  This version contains some very strong acting performances and the events flow in a way that comes across as more realistic than contrived.  I think Wuthering Heights is a difficult book to translate into film, but this is (without question) the best of all the film versions available.",1233100800,8,588,4.989795918367347
3761272,1,B001PUTN3Y,"I did not and would not buy this dvd, but I just finished watching it as a two-part series on Masterpiece Classic, and I found it beyond bad. The scriptwriter did include all three generations described in the book but took so many wild liberties that I was actually shocked. Heathcliff is depicted as nothing short of a madman. Cathy seems afraid of him in several scenes, so their ""eternal love story"" never works. Also, there were 3 (count em, 3) sex scenes in the movie, which meant it's not suitable for kids or for showing to students (I teach high school). These scenes were gratuitous and unnecessary and didn't serve to advance the plot at all. I mean, if Isabella and Cathy are pregnant, then viewers should have sense enough to know they had sex with their husbands without the camera having to follow them right into bed. I assume somebody thought Wuthering Heights needed to be tweaked to appeal to a modern audience. I believe that somebody was wrong.",1233014400,33,965,4.649122807017544

The only thing I did not like about it was how they made Heathcliff die. He is suppose to die of a broken heart pining for Cathy after her death but instead they have him kill himself by shooting himself in the head, or Hindly kills him I am unsure which.

3761279,3,B001PUTN3Y,"Screenwriter Peter Bowker observes that although WUTHERING HEIGHTS (1847) is considered one of the great love stories in literature, it really isn't a love story. Or at least, it is many things as well. It's a story about hate, class, revenge, sibling rivalry, loss, grief, family, violence, land and money..."" He noted that the book had previously proved ""stubbornly unadaptable, the most successful version being the Hollywood picture starring Laurence Olivier, which succeeded because ""with classic Hollywood ruthlessness they filleted out the Cathy/Heathcliff story and ditched the rest of the plot. It's a great film but it does the novel a disservice.""

And so Bowker set about writing a screenplay for this two-part ITV television series.  The episodes were directed by Coky Giedroyc and star Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley in the roles of the lovers Heathcliff and Cathy.  The series was first broadcast in January 2009 in the US as part of PBSs Masterpiece Classic programming.

The storyline of this version begins near the end of Brontes novel.  A young Catherine Linton of Thrushcross Grange discovers her cousins who live in the nearby farmhouse Wuthering Heights.  Her sickly cousin Linton and the healthier Hareton are the scorned and abused young men who live with the present owner of the estate, her uncle Heathcliff. Nelly (Sarah Lancashire), the housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, narrates the story and begins a flashback of Heathcliffs arrival at Wuthering Heights.

 Heathcliff is a young orphan boy found on the streets of Liverpool by a Yorkshire landowner.  Kind Mr. Earnshaw brings the boy home as a playmate for his son Hindley and his daughter Cathy.  When Hindley inherits his fathers estate, he delegates Heathcliff to the stables. Cathy becomes enamored with Edgar Linton, the elegant gentlemen who lives nearby at Thrushcross Grange. and agrees to marry him. Segregated from his soulmate, Heathcliff leaves the moors.

Three years later, Heathcliff returns to the moors the day after Cathy marries Edgar.  He has acquired Wuthering Heights by purchasing Lindleys gambling debts and seeks revenge on all he perceives have wronged him .  He courts and marries Edgar Lintons sister Isabella. He fosters the drunken Hindleys son Hareton.  Although his scorn brings misery to all including the next generation, the story returns to its beginning and ends celebrating the marriage of Cathys daughter and Heathcliffs foster son.

It took me several days to watch this very long television version.  Fascinated by the extended love story, I spent some time figuring out the Hindleys, Hintons, and Haretons.  And along the way I came to some conclusions about this love story, this story of soulmates.

Bland cinematography, sparse settings, and uninspired costumes make one truly listen to the dialogue and ponder the circumstances. A miscast of Tom Hardy as Heathcliff, stalking about the land in boots and a red leather vest, and Charlotte Riley as Cathy, a wild, silly girl even when she becomes mistress of Thrushcross Grange, promotes a naivete that isolation provides.  Heathcliff came to Wuthering Heights to live with the Earnshaws as another son.  Edgar and Isabella Linton, although wealthier than the Earnshaws. were just as unworldly as they--bound by the isolated land and a limited private education.

I also encountered a few problem watching an eight year old film.  Edgar Linton is portrayed by a fairly young Andrew Lincoln who is currently the star and chief zombie killer of THE WALKING DEAD; its hard to imagine him a proper English gentleman. Although Brontes novel includes acceptable Victorian marriage between cousins, there are no sexual scenes of lovers in bed in her 19th century novel.  She probably shuddered in her grave at the thought of it.

I think Ill order and watch the Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche 1992 film version. But I hear Binoche plays both Cathy and Cathys daughter Cathy, the latter in blonde wig.  Or maybe Ill just pop in the Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon 1939 version. It does depict only the first sixteen chapters of the novel and concludes with Cathys death.

But waitthe 1970 film with Timothy Dalton is just the love story, too",1502064000,,4214,5.142228739002933

3761338,5,B001PUTN3Y,"An outstanding performance by Tom Hardy made this version really stand out.  He was able to capture Heathcliff's complex character very well.  I usually don't like when a movie made from a classic novel veers too much from the author's original which this does to some degree.  However, the novel is too complex being told from several points of  opinionated views to pull off a perfect copy.  My only complaint is the ending which needlessly deviated too far the the novel's ending.",1468972800,,483,4.841463414634147

All others superbly cast.  Very atmospheric, as it must be.( I'm not sure how confusing all the relationships would be to one unfamiliar with the story -- I had to pause and explain to others watching with me.

3761400,3,B001PUTN3Y,"It wasn't a bad movie until the screenwriters wildly veered away from the book with how Heathcliff dies.  For the most part the movie is spot on with the book except that they divided the material into a different order... which I didn't mind that part.  But the idea that they could rewrite how Heathcliff died took an element away from the story line of the spiritual bond that Catherine and Heathcliff had.  I love this book but this movie kind of disappointed me.  Overall it is great acting, and the overall plot was not deviated from, but again the death scene was wrong. For this being Masterpiece Theatre I truly expected more from the way that they depicted Heathcliff's death.  I was expecting it to be truer to the book.  This is the only book that Emily Bronte ever wrote.  I knew that this was her main contribution to the literary world. I thought that Masterpiece Theatre would have been truer to her work. I fell in love with the book because of the bond that Heathcliff and Catherine had.  The movie only mildly point to the spiritual aspect of their relationship.  They were deeply connected and that shows through the whole movie until they get to the end.  I don't know who had the bright idea to deviate from the death scene in the book but that was part of the spiritual aspect of their relationship.  It was just very disappointing.  If I had not read the book I would have loved the movie as it was created.  It was well crafted overall.",1462752000,3,1461,4.467924528301887
3761401,5,B001PUTN3Y,"Honestly this is the best movie I have seen in a long time. From what I have read of the book, I like this version much better. It is probably because I read the book after watching the movie and was confused by the narrator. This movie also made me irrationally angry. The brother is such a douche because he thinks that his father is trying to replace him but actually he is just being a nice person. I see Hindley as the main antagonist. If he hadn't of forbidden Heathcliff to see Cathy while she was with Edgar, she would have most likely remained half-savage. Thus movie was such a roller coaster and I have watched it three times so far. all in all, I LOVE",1462492800,,663,4.228346456692913

3761491,2,B001PUTN3Y,"What I didn't like can be summed up in the music that was playing as Heathcliff saw a vision of Catherine at the end of the movie -- was it Highlands musak? It's not that I'm a purist. Major motifs seem to have gone missing, such as the uber-blondness of the Grange; was Linton supposed to be almost albino as the apex of all things Thrushcross Grange. Nelly was too old. It was the first time I've seen that actress play a different role that her usual strong modern woman in charge but has feelings. I knew she was familiar. Instead of looking her up I closed my eyes and remembered -- anyway, the wrong vibe again. That actor can't play a convincing Yorkshire servant.
But what really, really, really, really, really bums me out is when people adapt period dramas and have upper class characters speaking ungrammatically. This is unforgivable.",1455062400,2,846,4.6092715231788075

3761496,4,B001PUTN3Y,"This is a two-part Masterpiece Theater adaptation of Emily Bronte's classic masterpiece, ""Wuthering Heights."" It is filmed on the wild and windy Yorkshire moors and stars English actors Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley. That said, it a very loose adaptation. They eliminated some characters, and added some scenes and actions from an already dense and familiar novel. They did include both generations, which I think is important. Hardy has an animal grace and intensity that captures Heathcliff, but why did they put such obvious and ugly wigs on him? Taken on it's own, if you aren't familiar with the details of the novel, it's a pretty good movie. But if you like your novel to film adaptations faithfully rendered, this just doesn't do it. Bronte's novel is passionate, but since it's Victorian, it is not sexual - not this movie!! Heathcliff's death scene found me lurching to my feet with an utterance of shocked disbelief.

3761518,5,B001PUTN3Y,"Wuthering Heights is such an interesting book and this movie did a great job representing it.  It is dark, haunting, disturbing and evokes so many different emotions.  There's a lot of sadness, you witness a man become completely lost and tormented, growing deeper and deeper into a life of hatred and sadness.  It is a story of young love, lust, loss and pain.  There are a lot of characters that are not likable, many have no redeeming characteristics.
I experienced so many different emotions by watching it and found myself really sad at a lot of points.  The ending is bittersweet and even though Heathcliff had become a monster, it was sad to witness his suicide.
There are some scenes that end very abruptly and do not go into detail about what happened to certain characters and the ending doesn't close up the story well.  However, I still enjoyed watching the movie, it could be confusing for someone who hasn't read the book though.
Tom Hardy does a really good job portraying Heathcliff and really plays a tormented soul well.  I really recommend this movie if you are a fan of the book or if you are just curious about what Wuthering Heights is about.",1453161600,,1164,4.648780487804878

3761522,1,B001PUTN3Y,"I hate it when a movie loses much of it's meaning because scenes have been thoughtlessly cut. In addition to some more or less important scenes, the unforgettable opening scene where Cathy says to Heathcliff ""Let me in"" has been cut. This scene is essential to the atmosphere of Wuthering Heights.
I recommend the uncut Blu-ray Original UK Version (search on ""masterpiece classic wuthering heights"" under Movies & TV).
The uncut UK Version is my favorite version of Wuthering Heights. Tom Hardy is excellent as Heathcliff, and Charlotte Riley is an unforgettable Cathy. The two of them together are magic. ""How can I live without my life?""
Wuthering Heights is Emily Jane Bronte's masterpiece. Peter Bowker did a great job on the screenplay, although he took some liberties that change Cathy's character from the one Emily Bronte intended.
I also recommend ""The Annotated Wuthering Heights"" edited by Janet Gezari, a very insightful and beautifully illustrated book. In addition, I recommend ""The Complete Poems of Emily Jane Bronte"" edited by C.W. Hatfield. Emily Bronte felt her poems were so personal that she didn't want anyone to read them, and was aghast when Charlotte Bronte found and read them. Fortunately for all of us, Charlotte, and her younger sister Anne, encouraged Emily to have her poems published, along with Charlotte's and Anne's poems, as ""Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell"" (Charlotte, Emily, and Anne). The Bronte sisters went on to write and publish their masterpieces the following year: ""Wuthering Heights"" (Emily Jane), ""Jane Eyre"" (Charlotte), and ""Agnes Grey"" (Anne) (I personally prefer ""The Tenant of Windfell Hall"" to ""Agnes Grey"").",1451347200,,1670,5.211895910780669

Where other versions had me confused as to who was whom and what their relations were and why people were behaving as they did, this was crystal clear. In addition, the plot was absolutely psychologically compelling.  Yes, Heathcliff dealt ill with many, but every action of his was founded in his experience, which was amply shown. I only wish that somehow the feeling of the period had been better conveyed. Comparing it to the Outlander series, it looks like modern people in period dress rather than immersion into the time.

3761542,2,B001PUTN3Y,"Having read the book several times and seen all of the older movies, this is by far the one I dislike the most. The premise is okay, starting with Heathcliff already as an adult and using flashbacks as to how he became so vindictive,
but the screenplay completely over-dramatizes how abused he was as a child and ignores the
fact that he desperately tried to become
a worthy rival through education and work
experience to be able to marry his beloved. The adult Heathcliff is believable though, so maybe the producers thought that focusing on that aspect would distinguish this version from it's predecessors.
The film makes several comments regarding how the elite despised gypsies ( I don't remember this in the book) and since this is a British film, what has really changed? Gypsies are still shunned in the EU.

However, I am an English teacher and when I watch a movie based on a classic novel, I expect it to remain true to the original text. This version decided to completely change the ending of how Heathcliff meets his demise. The film omits some crucial scenes to understanding the story. The film also adds scenes that never occurred in the novel which changes the themes within the story. So, if you want to watch a drama about two ill- fated lovers, this is the film for you.

3761585,3,B001PUTN3Y,"This was a remake of the love story between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, yet it is far from holding true to the deep anguish and passion of the couple's love. It's almost too ""clean"" to be anything of the original black and white version that embodied the true darkness of the love--a love that surpasses time and the hate that lived within Heathcliff upon Catherine's death. He died when she died although he still breathed. I much prefer the original version even if it had been colorized. As an afterthought, I believe the author's depression yielded the depth of this novel that became a film and as well as being a gothic romantic epic love story.",1442534400,,658,4.681034482758621
3761586,4,B001PUTN3Y,Pretty good and talaneted acting..  I was disappointed in some of the turn of events but it was still good,1442448000,,106,4.3

3761589,2,B001PUTN3Y,"This is a muddled, disorganized presentation of Bronte's novel. Towards the middle of the production things get so confusing and histrionic that
I had a hard time staying with it. Finally, I despaired of slogging through it  and fast - forwarded it to the last 20 minutes of the show. I felt no guilt in doing so. Wuthering Heights is one of my favorite pieces of literature and I reread it recently, with enduring delight. Too bad this production did not reflect the complexity of the characters, especially that of Heathcliff.
However, the sets were nicely done and the wardrobes were authentic to the time.",1442448000,,609,4.8
3761590,5,B001PUTN3Y,Great movie!,1442102400,,12,5.5
3761591,4,B001PUTN3Y,"The one to watch first if you haven't read the book. This Masterpiece Theatre version does a better job of just plain telling the story than the Ralph Fiennes / Binoche version, and I thought Charlotte Riley was better than the icy-as-usual Binoche. That said, you can't beat Ralph Fiennes for psycho. Not that Tom Hardy does a bad job, he's very good, but Fiennes is other-worldly as Heathcliff.

My recommendation would be to watch the Tom Hardy first, and the Fiennes second, and between the two you have it covered. I'd be interested in comments from those who know the book well (I've not read it) as to which film does a better job. And if you like Tom Hardy, screen a more recent film, 'Child 46' - that is his magnum opus so so far in his career.

I would also be interested in comments from those who know the work as to the vocal interpretations by both Fiennes and Hardy, they both speak in a very clipped, staccato way, is that supposed to be local dialect? Just curious.",1441670400,,983,4.425414364640884
3761592,5,B001PUTN3Y,An excellent rendition of this classic.  Followed the book quite closely.  Tom Hardy made an excellent Heathcliff.,1441584000,,114,5.647058823529412
3761593,5,B001PUTN3Y,"This is by far the best version of Wuthering Heights. I collect black and white classic films, and never thought I would like a color version, but the actors are perfect in their roles. Having read the book, several times I will willingly admit that the movie does some things out of sequence and does other things completely different. If you're looking for an exact replica of the book, you may be slightly dissappointed. However, if you can just sit and enjoy a good classic story without over analyzing, I promise you will be pleasantly surprised.",1440633600,,551,4.75
3761594,5,B001PUTN3Y,I watch this film almost every night! I just think the whole product is put together with a great amount of care. The acting - oh my goodness - is phenomenal. Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley make you feel deeply their love and then each other's torment. I like this movie so much I bought the annotated copy of the book. I love the music so much in this film and wish there was a soundtrack for it. I cannot imagine loving another version of this film better than this one. If you haven't seen it yet drop everything you are doing and have a watch. You won't regret it.,1440201600,,567,4.163636363636364

His love is Cathy a girl whom is ultimately torn into two by her love for Heathcliff and another.

3761601,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I absolutely love this movie.  I was not familiar with the two main actors, but their performances were stellar.

3761612,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I say ""almost"" because the director left out one of the most moving and poignant parts of the story; The part where Heathcliff, having overheard Cathy's conversation with Nellie, left Wuthering Heights and Cathy went after him crying his name in the blustery night.  Other than that, and Heathcliff's death scene which was a little odd, this was by far the best adaption of this timeless classic.",1435276800,,396,4.91044776119403

3761615,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I would give this movie 10 stars if I could.  I am completely obsessed!  It has propelled me to read the book and I have had Kate Bushs' ""Wuthering Heights"" song on repeat for days now!  I think this book holds a lot of mystique and must have been quite a scandalous read for the time period.  Love, revenge, betrayal, anguish of soul.... I loved this version of Wuthering Heights because Tom Hardy (swoon) does the most amazing portrayal of Heathcliff.  In real life Tom is also to Marry the girl (Charolette) who plays Catherine.  It makes everything even more perfect and relatable.  Emily Bronte is a genius and this portrayal of Wuthering Heights does not disappoint.",1434412800,,672,4.6923076923076925

3761629,2,B001PUTN3Y,"I did not care for this movie. Perhaps I just did not like the story - I did not read the book so I cannot contrast that. The only reason I gave it two stars is because (Spoiler Alert!!)

In the end when Heathcliff blows his brains out after Catherine does not respond to his evil, evil lost it's power over them, and could only destroy itself.  Yay for that. Why the heck anyone would even like Heathcliff or find him attractive is a love of darkness. I couldn't stand Heathcliff or Cathy's character. Blech.",1433548800,,509,4.347368421052631

It is challenging to present in a visual version the complexities and nuances of a novel that is read and digested over a period of hours or days. The one question is to what degree a film script of such a classic work should take liberties with the original--especially for such an iconic work--in an effort to simplify, shorten, and still present the story forcefully. My impression is the film could have been more accurate to the original and taken fewer such liberties without sacrificing the overall effect.

3761675,5,B001PUTN3Y,"While plodding through Emily Bronte's classic, struggling to navigate the language style of a bygone era, I had the opportunity to watch both the 1939 film version of Wuthering Heights and the more contemporary Masterpiece Theatre version. This film brings the characters to life in a way that neither the original novel nor the 1939 film does. The cinematography is outstanding and the actors are able to portray complex characters flawed by pride, vengeance and madness in a way that makes their behavior understandable if not sympathetic. The Masterpiece Theatre version incorporates the storyline of Catherine and Heathcliff's children, which the 1939 film omits. While watching this film should never substitute for reading the original novel, it illuminates the characters and brings the story to life.,",1428883200,5,809,5.428571428571429

3761715,1,B001PUTN3Y,"This was not true enough to the novel for me.  I didn't like that they painted Heathcliff as a beaten down guy, who was good at one  point.  When I read the novel, I found no sympathy or redeeming characteristics in the character Heathcliff or even Catherine.  Both were manipulative, mean spirited, and egocentric, using each other to their own end.  I didn't even get that it was necessarily love between them, but rather a twisted, poisoned version of what obsession looks like.  It was truly a read about some of the most despicable characters possible, who excelled at vengeance and tantrums.  I think it was a missed opportunity to portray those characters in any other light or to try and give justification or explanation as to why they behaved that way.  Sometimes characters (and people) are just bad.  They're self centered, hateful, and unlikable for no good reason other than they want it that way.  Not sure why that has to be sugar coated or modified.  Emily Bronte understood that, which is why she wrote the characters that way.

If I were to have watched this without ever having read the novel, I would have probably found it entertaining, although what's with all the sex scenes?!  This is PBS, not HBO.",1425945600,22,1223,4.712264150943396

This movie felt lacking, slapped together and just carnal. The storytelling left me wondering why Cathy loved Heathcliff, you see them as friends as kids but don't get much as adults and it merely becomes physical. So, they just liked each other for their bodies?... Alright.
The sex scenes themselves are not in the books and are not important to the story and just eye candy I guess. (Gag)
It was emotional I'll give it that, but even when it grabbed me all I had to do was think ""Oh, but, why are they all in a huff? I don't know, they say it is love but looks like it is just lust to me"" and the emotion was gone.",1422921600,10,721,4.194244604316546

Obviously, the movie must cut out some scenes and some dialogue to make it suitable for a motion picture; however, I was very impressed with this version of Wuthering Heights. I thought it was very well done. A lot of the signature monologues and most significant dialogue are included in the film. Some of the dialogues belongs to different characters in the book than in the movie and the story is told from a different point of view in the book but all in all, I was not disappointed.

3761743,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I have been thinking about what it is in this story that haunts me. One of the themes  is abandonment - another reviewer pointed that out. That is surely haunting.

 I also want to add that in this story there is a lot of moments where the woman is pleading to the man to open his heart.  I remember times in my life where I did the same thing and I think this movie re-opened those wounds - in a good way. Afterwards I read some articles online. It said that in today's world, a woman will leave her man if he is not cherishing her. That wasn't an option a long time ago. So men have to step up and start loving us and not all of them are on board. Not all women are brave enough yet to leave their man, even though they are fully capable of doing so in this age. Those women can resent the other women who are brave enough to take the leap and find a decent guy.

For men, they have to be motivated by something to change their heart. What motivates them? Well, a man who is a jerk is choosing between anger and compassion. To him, it doesn't feel like a choice but it is. He has to recognize that first. When his wife is telling him she'll leave, he starts to feel inadequate in his ability to love. He can choose to interpret that feeling as punishment (which it is not) and get stuck in his anger....or he can say to himself ""I don't want to feel inadequate anymore. I want to change. I want to learn how to be compassionate instead."" So that feeling of inadequacy should be his motivation.

Another theme is that Heathcliff is clearly a malignant narcissist and that is one of the most destructive personality types on earth! May you never be the victim of one!

The poor women in this story! To be dependent on men like that. To not have great resources like Psychology Today to help them navigate the insanity around them.

All in all, this movie transported me to another place and time. It gave me things for my own soul and personal experiences to reflect on. I really liked it. Well worth the time spent watching it. It's also in two parts so you can take a break in the middle if needed.

Please, may no man reading this review think I am bashing men. I have made peace between the sexes. Men are great. Women are great. This story speaks to how far we have come and shines a light on the importance of continuing to bridge the gap between us.

3761761,4,B001PUTN3Y,"I would have given this adaptation a five star rating but for the very ending.  The movie's interpretation was brilliant up to that point.  One of the problems of the book (in my humble opinion) is that its author, Emily Bronte, had no experience of love and sex herself. She had been raised completely isolated from the world and had never been married.  I believe that this led to her rather fantastical themes of ghosts, miraculous preservation of dead bodies and deeper than normal connections of soul- all hyper romantic notions.  While I loved the whole book and wouldn't change  thing, I have to say I rather loved how the movie brought out the more realistic sexual relationship between the characters while still preserving their never ending soul connection.  I love how they managed to use technology to convey how Heathcliff saw the corpse as completely still alive while we saw the dead bones.  I love how the movie showed Heathcliff, alive and well, joining Cathy in the church for mischief once more while allowing Hareton to find him in bed, having blown his brains out.  I actually caught my breath, I was so surprised!  I liked those bits of realism as opposed to the book's fantasies.  However, (and this is how the movie lost its one star), the movie pooped out in the end!  Why, oh, why, didn't the movie end one the same note?  It ended most bizarrely.  We see Heathcliff and Catherine standing like imps inside the house looking down at Hareton and Cathy.  Why?  They hated being trapped indoors.  The book's ending was much better!  They were free in the end.  Finally!  They were seen from time to time, by villagers, roaming the moors hand in hand.  To see them oddly trapped like that made me sad and a little miffed.  It was so unlikely.  In addition, the book left on a very positive note for Cathy and Hareton.  It was clear that Hareton would inherit the property and would become rich and the two would live happily ever after- that was the insinuation.  The blackness and revenge died with Heathcliff.  But the end of this movie was so abrupt and strange- without good reason.  Why was everything packed up in the cart and why was the young couple holding hands and oddly smiling?  Why did they walk away from the house?  It's  abrupt ending made no sense at all.  It was impossible to understand its meaning.  I didn't like the way we were left hanging.  The movie made such pains in its interpretation of the book and then just plopped in the last 2 minutes.

3761787,5,B001PUTN3Y,This version of Wuthering Heights by Masterpiece Theatre is so remarkable and intoxicating that I can't help watching it over and over and over again. I am obsessed by this movie and Tom Hardy who has become my all time favorite actor.,1414627200,,235,4.619047619047619
3761788,4,B001PUTN3Y,"I have to admit I'm confounded by the remark from the reviewer who based a poor review on the opinion that this film is ""not family-friendly"" or ""not for children,"" as I'm mystified why anyone would think that ""Wuthering Heights"" (in any adaptation) was a story for children. There sometimes seems to be a general misperception that just because a novel was written in the 19th century and is considered a literary classic, that it's somehow appropriate for all ages.

Charlotte Riley comes very close to my idea of Cathy, at least physically. If she's not as ""bratty"" as she is in the novel, as other reviewers have pointed out, that's perhaps on the screenwriters, not on Ms. Riley, as there are some scenes in the novel in which kitty definitely shows her claws (most notably, flying into a temper and slapping Edgar while he's courting her, leading the reader to wonder why he wants to marry her). The fact that a few of these scenes have been omitted from the film does seem to result in a Cathy who is perhaps more sympathetic than she should be.

Tom Hardy doesn't disappoint as Heathcliff, and plays him very ably, I think, but while I wouldn't base a review on this, he just doesn't look like Heathcliff to me. It would be awesome to assemble a ""Dream Team"" of people from a variety of adaptations of ""Wuthering Heights"" -- my all-time favorite Heathcliff has always been Ralph Fiennes in the 1998 TNT TV adaptation, although I would have liked to have seen him paired with someone a little more feral than Juliette Binoche.

Andrew Lincoln's Edgar Linton was a pleasant surprise. Edgar is almost always portrayed as such an insufferable milquetoast, and this was the first Edgar I didn't spend the entire production wanting to slap.

--spoilers below--

Not only did I not mind the sex scenes, but I'll even go so far as to say I thought they were good choices. ""Wuthering Heights"" is a story with many undercurrents of carnality, even if these aren't expressly stated in the novel. I think people forget that in the era in which Bronte wrote the novel, sex was something that was absolutely *not* discussed in literature, or anywhere else for that matter. To a Victorian reader, the fact that Isabella is even pregnant with Heathcliff's child would have been shocking, even despite the fact that she's married to Heathcliff, because the reader knows that he not only doesn't love her, but he has also blatantly used her sexually to serve his own ends. In the novel, he's not just out for a rape or a casual fling -- he is deliberately ruining her to get back at her brother, and the societal implications of the destruction of a woman's virtue are perhaps lost in translation in today's mentality. The sex scenes are, in my opinion, relevant, and are not gratuitous ... besides one brief view of Mr. Lincoln's bum, there's nothing that would be considered over-the-top for a PG-13 rating. In fact, I thought that scene, while very brief, did a great job of conveying the character's frustration as he tries to assert himself in the only way he knows how, even though he clearly knows that he will only ever have the smallest and most disingenuous pieces of this woman's heart.

There are scenes in this film which are not in the novel, which is something I suppose would get in the way of a good review for a true purist of the book. As a lifelong fan of the book, I personally always wanted a glimpse of Cathy and Edgar's wedding, or of their wedding night, or lack thereof. Surely Bronte imagined these events -- the fact that they're not expressly included in the novel doesn't mean they couldn't reasonably appear in an intelligent adaptation of the novel.

I didn't miss Mr. Lockwood or indeed any of the scenes where he appears in the book. In the novel, he's entirely a plot device, a casual observer through whose eyes we see certain characters and events. There are plenty of other ways to do this in film, and while the idea of a ""tenant"" would have been familiar to Victorian readers, I don't think his presence would make as much sense in a modern adaptation. I did miss the omniscience of Nelly, however, as a narrator, and her role was greatly reduced in this treatment.

As many other reviewers have already noted, many adaptations omit entirely the ""second generation"" aspect of the story dealing with Catherine Jr., Linton and Hareton, and this version does attempt it. While it was a better treatment of this part of the novel than others that have attempted it (notably, the silliness of the ""dual role"" in the 1998 TNT version, in which Juliette Binoche donned a blonde wig to play Catherine Jr.), I've yet to see an adaptation that really conveyed this part of the story effectively. The reader never questions the continuance of the story in the novel, but this continues to seem to be an almost ""unmakeable"" part of the book.

The film is visually gorgeous -- I especially liked the opening credits flying over the moors -- and the art direction captures the haunting mood of the story. A particularly effective bonus was the dual view of what Heathcliff sees when he exhumes Cathy's body vs. what the audience sees.

I leave off a fifth star only because of the omission of some of the novel's most famous dialogue. When lines in a novel go so far as to become immortal in literature, filmmakers ought to make sure those lines are uttered, no matter how the story is structured or altered.",1414627200,3,5424,4.646506777893639

3761814,4,B001PUTN3Y,"Masterpiece Theater's production of ""Wuthering Heights"" is a magnificent film with absolutely gorgeous photography. The film is worth watching for the photography alone. Cathy in a white dress galloping over the moors on a white horse, Heathcliff in black on a black horse, the mists that rise like miasmas of doom, the closeups of faces writhing in pain, for  the souls of ""Wuthering"" agonize- Heathcliff and Cathy and Edgar Linton and Isabella Linton. All of the characters seem to be creatures of a fate they can't dispel or avoid. Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley as Cathy and Heathcliff smolder on the screen and they are in a real life relationship. Unlike Emily Bronte's lovers who seem almost pristinely pure sexually, there is explicit and implicit sex in the film and it is needed to round out the characters of  these  passionate men and women. Cathy and Heathcliff  lie together on the moors, Edgar Linton (Andrew Lincoln) is almost frenzied in his love making with Catherine in their bed, Heathcliff demands Isabella (Rosalind Halstead) not look at him as he takes her with revulsion. Isabella has much more spunk and importance in this adaptation but with her love for Heathcliff her fate is sealed. However you get mad at her for being so foolish. Did somebody say love is blind? Sarah Lancashire as Nelly provides a stabilizing force throughout the film and more or less keeps Cathy from going off the deep end.

In spite of the many critical reviews of ""Wuthering"" as noted above, the movie is worth renting for the photography alone. The directors grab you by the scruff of the neck and deposit you in Yorkshire where you cannot escape. You may not like Tom Hardy's face (he looks like Oscar Wilde)and I have to admit that my thoughts on Heathcliff nostalgically return to the superb face of Lawrence Olivier. Nevertheless Hardy plays Heathcliff as rather uncouth and even when he returns in his clothes of a gentleman he still appears somewhat uncouth, somewhat uncomfortable in his new role. I think that rendition quite faithfully restores Emily Bronte's  tortured character. BUT Heathcliff's suicide is way off the mark. Heathcliff should have died as he did in the book, hurling himself across the moors in pursuit of the ghost of Cathy who has touched him with her icy fingers. Charlotte Riley's portrayal of Cathy is of a much too sweet girl, far from Bronte's picture of her as vain, wild and opportunistic. She cannot be sweet and say as she does ""I am Heathcliff!""",1410652800,,2489,4.844705882352941
3761815,1,B001PUTN3Y,"I feel like too many liberties were taken with this film. It only loosely follows Miss Bronte's story, and the characters weren't even close to the original.

No offense to Ralph Fiennes, but they really nailed Heathcliff in this movie.  Sure, Tom Hardy is hot and all that but I feel his version of this character was right on with how I imagined Heathcliff when I originally read W. Heights.

3761927,4,B001PUTN3Y,"While I never read the book, I enjoyed the movie.  One could get a real sense of Heathcliff's descent into despair and really into madness.  It was interesting to untangle the relationship lines.  There was a lack of concern about the appropriateness of the relationship between not only Cathy and Heathcliff (while not blood relatives, they had been raised as brother and sister), but also the fact that Cathy and Hareton are first cousins (Cathy's mother and Hareton's father were brother and sister).",1387065600,,503,5.036144578313253
3761928,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I absolutely loved this movie! Tom Hardy is my new celebrity crush. I think he did a fantastic job playing Heathcliff. My impression of Heathcliff while reading the book was a little darker and angrier, but I liked the cool souless perspective Hardy played. I didn't get the same impression with the Ralph F. guy.

I thought the relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy was shown very passionately in this movie. The only disappointment I found was that some parts were mixed and matched to different scenes than they should be. For example, I was really looking forward to the scene where Cathy is asking Miss Dean if she should marry Linton, and in the book, Heathcliff overhears and runs away and Cathy runs out into the storm screaming his name but he never comes back. Her storm scene was moved in the movie to when she was pregnant and Heathcliff mysteriously heard her from his window and ran out to meet her. I found myself yelling at the screen so many times, ""That's not how it happened!"" But I guess that's the consequence of movies. Miss Dean's character in the movie was also a little flater than I expected. Sometimes it seemed like her eyes were kind of zombie-like and dead, rather than the lively, spirited chatterbox I took her to be. Overall though, I recommend this movie!",1386720000,,1293,4.671052631578948

I never read the book previous to watching this movie so I decided to buy it via Kindle to see if it will become a favorite of mine.  It's wordy, it drags on, and it doesn't keep my attention. I've had to re-read sentences over and over because my mind was drifting elsewhere. I dislike the detached narration from second hand accounts of the two main character's relationship. Not to mention Joseph's mangled English. Perhaps if I read the book first I would have appreciated it more because the movie spoiled me. I read up to just after Catherine married Edgar and I searched for any type of romantic relationship between her and Heathcliff, but found none. They seemed to be just platonic childhood friends and that disappointed me. To be fair, I didn't finish reading the book and there might be some kind of inkling that they were more than friends, but the movie didn't neglect to add their own spice to it early on and satisfy the hopeless romantic in me.",1382400000,,1058,4.539267015706806

3761936,5,B001PUTN3Y,"It is my suspicion that ""Wuthering Heights"" was Emily Bronte's own personal fantasy.  Such a tale of impossible, dark beauty of passionately requited, obsessive love between two star crossed lovers torn asunder by demands of class and society could only be born in the mind of one who personally desired, but never found what she was looking for herself.  For one thing, Emily Bronte (a preacher's daughter) was very like her heroine, Cathy; never at home anywhere beyond the moors, a free spirit denying the influence of others; even using a pseudonym to protect herself (and I'm sure, her family) from censure as she cast this iconoclastic novel to the winds of literary fate.  In dying at age 30, she perhaps never came close to a Heathcliff of her imagination, but she left a story of enduring proportions for the rest of us.  Once seen, it is unforgettable; truly worthy of the acclaim of ""Masterpiece"".  The book, which I haven't read for many, many years stirs the imagination; the movie brings the vibrance of life - the essential dimension.

Heathcliff initially appears at Wuthering Heights with the patriarch of the family, who has been away on business and reappears with a strange young boy in tow, whom he says he found wandering the streets of London and decided to adopt him.  (the whispered public opinion of this was that the boy was the result of a  misalliance between the old gentleman and a Gypsy lady of the evening, which actually is more plausible when you think of it; but it is not truly revealed as such, it is left dangling, open to interpretation)  He already has two children, a beautiful little girl, Cathy and her surly older brother, Hindley - who immediately becomes insanely jealous of Heathcliff, whom he views as the usurper in his comfortable world.  Cathy and Heathcliff are also immediately attracted to each other, because they are alike in every way that matters - first as children playing on the Moors;  the bonding emotions deepening in natural progression as they mature - flaming into obsessive passions, sharing their very souls as well.  But the problems of family interventions begin to appear at that point, throwing them headlong into the turmoil of ""for appearances sake and the station in life"" thing.

Finally driven out by his own pride and the unrelenting torment of his insecure and jealous foster brother after the father dies, Heathcliff leaves - but grimly vows to return with the means to destroy those who ruined his own life and thwarted his chances with the love he wants from Cathy.  But it takes time to prepare for revenge, and time is never a friend of youth in matters of the heart.  When he does return, having amassed his own worldly goods ""the same way it is always done, taking advantage of the weaknesses of other men"", it is far too late and thereby lies the tale that leaves them all destitute in its wake.  The final moments of the film are symbolic of the aftermath, with the bittersweet victory revealed in the strangest of ways.

""Oh, my fortune has changed me in every *way* - except one - and I would change that too, if I could."" (Heathcliff to Cathy)

Perhaps it's because I'm secretly an admitted incurable romantic in many ways but this is my favorite of the ""Wuthering Heights"" films; I have seen several versions.  This one smolders in the chemistry between the actors; taking far more freedom in portraying the heady love story - as it so richly deserves.  The casting is superb; Tom Hardy in long hair as the brooding and angry Heathcliff, and Charlotte Riley, taking the role of Cathy, the beautiful, willful woman whom he loves and loses, driving him beyond the brink of madness.

The ""forward"" comments for Masterpiece Theatre by Laura Linney highlight the ""story behind the story"" life of the author of this intriguing tale, reminding us once again that not everything great is appreciated at first blush.  Yes, Emily Bronte was a preacher's daughter extraordinaire.",1382054400,3,3962,4.795588235294118

3761944,3,B001PUTN3Y,"I was so excited to watch Masterpiece Theatre's version of my favorite book, remembering how well done they portrayed Jane Eyre. I have read the book innumerable times since I can remember and while I loved the movie and all the acting abilities, it was came very short to the details in the book. There were so many ""It didn't happen that way!"" moments for me throughout the movie. Edgar never brought his nephew Linton to Heathcliff, it was Nelly. Catherine and Heathcliff never slept together(at least the book gave no indication of this happening), which seemed to take away some of the intense drama that should have been in the movie. Catherine was more strong willed and vivacious in the book, but came across as an undecided and confused woman on film. So much of Heathcliff's cruel disposition was not there, therefore making him seem more ""soft"".
 So many times when a line was said it was coming from the wrong person entirely. Edgar never spoke to Isabella on the road to church as portrayed, what he said was originally spoken to Nelly after Isabella had left the following morning. I was disappointed at so many mix-ups which left me piecing together the story in my mind to remember where in the movie I was. The book was jumbled to adapt it better to film as so many other movies before have been. It seemed lacking in the intense emotion between Heathcliff and Catherine, but came across as a battle of revenge between the two.

In 1998 Masterpiece Theater provided the then best WH with Robert Cavanah and Orla Brady and matched it with this 2009 version starring Tom Hardy.  There are differences between the two but find both equally satisfying. The performance of Tom Hardy was romantic, scary, heartbreaking and, coupled with his Robert Dudley in Elizabeth I-The Virgin Queen (also a wonderful Masterpiece offering starring Ann-Marie Duff with Tom Hardy) have made me an ardent fan of Mr. Hardy!",1373760000,,582,5.0

It's been years since I've read Wuthering Heights but my sweet husband, who knows how much I love period pieces, put Masterpiece Theater's 2009 adaptation on our Netflix queue.  I confess that my main reason for getting excited to watch this movie is because of Twilight.  Remember how Bella and Edward are always talking about Cathy and Heathcliff?  I wanted to see what all that fuss was about.

All I remembered from reading the book back in high school was that the story is sad and set on the moors.  Watching the movie brought it all back to me, though: just how sad the story is and what a love/hate relationship Cathy and Heathcliff truly have.

I think that Tom Hardy as Heathcliff did an excellent job.  His mannerisms were perfect and gave him an air of manic desperation.  He was longed to be with Cathy, but his own arrogance got in the way of happiness.  Instead, he turned into a scorned, spiteful being whose only purpose was hate and bringing despair to those he felt wronged by.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, although on the whole, the story is dark and haunting.  It is definitely not a feel-good story---so, be prepared for that.  It is definitely worth watching, though.",1373760000,,1211,4.629107981220657

It was well done and well cast, except the actor portraying Hareton he wasn't the strapping boy I expected, neither was he coarse enough. Tom Hardy as Heathcliff was excellent, although maybe he should've had dark contacts so his eyes were more gypsy-like.

This gets three stars because Heathcliff was made more gentlemanly and almost kinder than the book.  He was too good to Isabella.  They also added sex, even a brief flash of breast, and a couple of awkward scenes.  This is only modern, I guess, but the angst in the book is a result of Heathcliff never having had Cathy for himself.  The angst in this movie was lessened, I think.",1372550400,,735,4.564885496183206

3761969,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I badly misjudged this movie (and it IS a movie, despite its production for TV) in my first review.

I was offended by the smarmy introduction, with Laura Linney giving the most cringe-inducingly hammy performance of her career as the totally unnecessary presenter of this drama that needs no introduction; by the harshness of Tom Hardy's Heathcliff in the first few scenes I watched; and most seriously by the total elimination of Lockwood and other elements of the novel that seemed unforgivable at the time.

Afterwards, I revisited ALL the earlier (and later) filmed adaptations and realized that all of them butcher Bront's novel far more flagrantly and offensively than this one does (the Olivier/Oberon travesty is the most disgusting), and that this one comes so close to the heart of the novel that it deserves profoundest praise for what it accomplishes, not niggling criticism for its very few and very minor flaws.

This is without question the best adaptation ever attempted of the most fascinating, most powerful, and (still, after nearly 200 years) the strangest novel ever written in English. It's a challenging book to read, and even more challenging to capture on film. The producers, writer, director and entire cast of this production have created a cinematic masterpiece almost as stunning as the novel on which it is based.",1369612800,3,1345,5.076923076923077

3761993,3,B001PUTN3Y,"This is an incredibly grim story, typical of a time that was shared by gothic horror and complex love stories.  ""Wuthering Heights"" in essence is both, a tragic story of twisted love, well portrayed but ultimately too disturbing to watch without risking bad dreams for the next several nights.

Heathcliff is a gypsy orphan adopted by a wealthy Englishman living in the dark Yorkshire moors with his arrogant son and beautiful daughter, Catherine.  Heathcliff and Cathy are childhood sweethearts, but when it comes to meeting the mores of the times by marrying, Cathy chooses an upstanding neighbor.  Heathcliff, whose brooding anger, resentment and hatred for the evil adopted brother who has relegated him to near slavery, runs off and makes his fortune, then returns to wreak vengeance on Cathy, whom he believes betrayed him.

This is a saga of extreme personal evil, the portrait of a man whose perverse love drives him to destroy everyone around him.  The acting and production are excellent, although Tom Hardy's wig looks ready to blow off in the next moor wind. This is just too dark a story for me, and I honestly didn't enjoy it.

What I didn't like was the actor playing Heathcliff.  I also didn't like that they changed the ending and he shot himself.  If that were the true ending he should've done it as soon as Catherine died.  Why live out all those years without her if you're going to commit suicide in the end anyway.

Tom Hardy was excellent as Heathcliff - perfectly able to show passion and rage, while also mastering subtle changes in body language and expression that made for a true character performance.  Charlotte Riley was also very good as Cathy.  This Cathy wasn't portrayed with quite the same character flaws as she has in the books, but there were small glimpses (such as when Isabella attacks Cathy for wanting all the attention at the dinner table).  Andrew Lincoln was a good Edgar Linton.  He definitely made the character sympathetic....caught in the crosshairs of Cathy and Heathcliff's love.

The movie stars chosen, in my opinion, though they seem to try hard, quite never fit the characters they represent.  Heathcliff, as acted by Tom Hardy, appears as a totally insensitive person even sometimes towards Cathy. His expression never changes.  It just doesn't give one the feeling that such a person is the same Heathcliff we read about in the novel.  The hair of Heathcliff (make-up artist failure) is a total mess and always on his face even when he returns as a rich man. Cathy, as acted by Charlotte Riley, does not convey the determination, passion  and sweetness of Cathy in the novel.  The scene in which Heathcliff digs out Cathy from the grave is just gruesome and sudden without any preparation for it.
The cinematography is great; the scenery, houses, clothing used, roads, mansions, furniture,  are all very real and appropriate for that period.  Other actors, like the maid of Cathy, Cathy's husband, her sister-in-law, her father,  are all excellent, very well casted.

But this incarnation of Heathcliff is ""over the top.""  And I was shocked by the sex and nude scenes.  There's no explicit sex or nudity in the book.

3762012,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I must admit that when I heard that Tom Hardy was in a version of one of my all-time favorite stories, I was very curious.  Although I am a fan of Hardy's work, I could not imagine him in the role of Heathcliff made famous by Laurence Olivier and then later by Timothy Dalton.  To me, Timothy Dalton's version of Heathcliff has always been the best.  I never thought, I could ever enjoy anyone else in that role.  Well, I stand corrected.  Hardy not only met my expectations, but surpassed them as well. I had mistakenly thought that Hardy was a good actor whose range only included thugs and boxers.  How happily wrong I was.  Hardy brings a down to earth realism to Heathcliff that has never been seen on film before. It seems that Mr. Hardy has no limits to his acting abilities and his ""acting muscles"" are just as pronounced as the ones on his frame.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend it.",1348704000,16,912,4.419161676646707

3762017,5,B001PUTN3Y,"i have read the book. i loved this version of the story. 5 stars.

full of spoilers!

i thought the Cathy presented, not the fault of the actress, but the writer,  was misrepresented. in the book, Cathy is a right bi***, slapping servants and messing with people's heads. she is the cause of all the drama in the story. i thought the very tame cathy in the film was too nice and sympathetic. this heathcliff is toned down, because they left out his wife beating and killing the neighborhood pets. they omitted that he was basically a psycho stalker and made him more sympathetic. they changed the ending, almost as if they ran out of time for production. in the book he decides to join Cathy by starving himself over the course of a week (tear jerker). and in the book, his does not lie with the corpse, instead she visits him on the side of the grave and sits with him for a while.  also one must remember that cathy and heathcliff were 18 and 20 when she dies so look at all the teen angst, with unformed characters and teen jello brains, instead of two adults. this will change your perspective on the characters of the book.

that said, this production made me weep, yell at the tv, wonder if they were brother and sister, why wasn't he baptized, screaming ""bi***"" at cathy. the scene where he gives the animal like horrific howl is straight out of the book and i thought they broke up the lengthy death scene speeches into three parts was well done.  heathcliff is the personification of someone who is ""stuck"" -- stuck developmentally, spiritually, and emotionally.

i was melancholy for days after watching, cracking open the book, and re-reading it. i have to say i played the movie over and over again, not good for a week in Houston, Texas where it rained all week. by the end of the week studying Bronte in the pouring nonstop rain, i was an emotional wreck -- what i did over my summer vacation. yeah.

the entire story messes with your head. it has so many layers and open ended questions. i have always wondered why, in the scene where he observed cathy jr. and hareton getting long lovingly; it was the point of change in both the novel and the movie, where heathcliff could have chosen to thrive and be happy in his new happy family. he walks the moors with a smile on his face and he said he never felt stronger. instead he chose to die. such a depressing bummer.

tom hardy is such a magnficient heathcliff. tore me to shreds. i wonder what he could have done with the part if they had chosen the happy heathcliff choosing to starve himself, instead of the abrupt ending.

in case you're wondering, in the book,  he did leave the estate to the kids.",1342828800,4,2667,4.433537832310838
3762018,4,B001PUTN3Y,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was""Wuthering Heights,"" an adaptation of the classic novel for PBS Masterpiece Theater programming. In fact, the movie came in parts 1 and 2 as if these were two separate hours of TV viewing. It was surprisingly little altered from the TV version, but I'm not complaining. The movie was well produced. I particularly liked the bleak and gloomy far north glaciated setting. I'd guess it to be filmed in northern Scotland. Somehow the bleak setting fit in remarkably well with the story as it unfolded. The old castle-like setting was magnificent. The costuming and acting were first rate, as was the cinema. To make it short, the movie was very well done.

Wuthering Heights is a classical and widely-acclaimed novel and several movies have been made based on it. Well, sorry, but I just didn't care for the story at all and I would never, now, read the book or go back and watch or re-watch any of the movie versions. Whether it's movies or novels, I just don't care for stories that severly depress me and this one certainly did. I can see literary or cinema critics loving it. Somehow, that's easy. It's a bleak and dreary love story where everyone suffers and everyone loses. Well, I feel that I lost in watching it. However, that's just a personal opinion and others may feel quite differently. I would certainly admit that the movie itself, other that the story, was exceptionally well done.

It doesn't matter to me that Cathy never curses him and Linton for killing her, it doesn't need these particles from the novel to make a drama that works.

Most of the other movies are just mere shadows of the actual passionate story that is in the novel. However, this movie truly surprised me. I felt that the characters had a lot of depth that made this my favorite adaptation so far. There are certainly flaws and I feel that it's missing an element, since Cathy's ghost is not really included. I feel that is it's largest flaw. Tom Hardy does a fascinating job as Heathcliff and I think one of the greatest moments in the film is when he learns of Cathy's death and makes this horrid noise. The noise is described in the novel and I think Hardy did an excellent job. It is absolutely heartwrenching to watch and to listen to. You can feel his pain permeating through the screen. However, SPOILER ALERT, I found it fascinating that they chose to have Heathcliff shoot himself. I thought that was a very interesting way to go and added another depth into the story and makes me want to go back and look at the novel with new eyes.

Where this movie excels is in the relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine, the viewer feels the love, the passion, the madness, the despair, the obsession...it's just breathtaking when Catherine and Heathcliff are together in any given scene. Also the music and cinematography was great.

On the downside, there's a scene when Heathcliff and Catherine are in a chapel, and Heathcliff says one sentence that makes me cringe and puts me off, and I don't remember it being in the book, so I really don't understand why they added that to the movie. My other gripe with this movie is the ending, they (Spoiler alert) have Heathcliff blowing his brains out. In the book Heathcliff died a natural death, sitting in his chair on a cold and rainy day (which I thought would have been more moving, Heathcliff dying as in the book, of heartbreak).

But overall, right now there is no better version of Wuthering Heights than this.

***WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY***

Wuthering Heights is a dark and forbidden love story between a young woman, Catherine, and her adopted gypsy brother, Heathcliff.  The movie is based on the novel and portrays the possessive, violent and obsessive nature of the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff beautifully.  Even though neither of the starcrossed lovers is a particulary good person, you can't help but want them to be together.  After the death of Catherine's father, her brother returns and takes over Wuthering Heights and control of Heathcliff; treating him like a servant and abusing him.  I actually felt sorry for Heathcliff.  He was treated horribly by Cathy's brother and was ultimately betrayed by Cathy.  He genuinely loved her and she had broken his heart.  Her betrayal is what made him so cruel and started his downward descent into madness.  Catherine was quite an unlikable character as she dismisses Heathcliff for wealth and her reputation in ""proper society.""  Although a married woman, she continued her trysts with Heathcliff behind her husband's back as he is and will always be her true love.  This version of their doomed love story will leave you breathless and wanting more.",1314057600,6,1571,5.1299212598425195
3762039,3,B001PUTN3Y,"An interesting take on the novel, but takes a lot of liberties, obviously to try to make the movie more ""salacious"".  None of the changes are ""harmful"" to the story, but if you've read the book, you do notice the differences when comparing.

In my opinion, the scenes jump around too much and the overall movie does not flow smoothly.

This Heathcliff is quite tame and boring compared to the book & prior versions of this movie.

If you just want to watch a movie with a storyline BASED on a classic book, it is worth a watch, but if you are expecting a movie that is more like the book, this is not the one.",1306540800,3,609,4.224137931034483

I have seen the old one with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, directed by William Wyler, and the one with Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche. All 3 vary a bit from the book, and all 3 are somewhat incomplete when compared with the book. But, until someone makes a 6 hour version or something, some matter has to be left out. What this focused on was the middle part of the book, which was the relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy. I don't think Lockwood is even mentioned in this film version.

Bronte's classic is presented to us by Peter Bowker as subtly as if we are reading a road map. We are told early on repeatedly that Heathcliff is a ""Gypsy"" who has not and never will make peace with God, and that he is out for revenge. We do not have to guess whether or not his character will alter, much less mature. In this adaptation they might get older, but they will never grow. Otherwise the dullest viewer might, heaven forbid, miss the trivial lessen passing by that he is now required to grasp.

The world is so full of wonderful variations on the towering novels of Jane Austen and the Brontes that it is a wonder that until now none were really second-rate. It was hard to go far wrong with any version. Indeed I never imagined it possible.

3762051,4,B001PUTN3Y,"This adaption of Emily Bronte's 1847 gothic novel is rich in characterization, plot, and visuals.  The moors are stark with Wuthering Heights looming like an ancient curse.

The primary story is about three children--Hindley, Catherine and Heathcliff.  Catherine and Heathcliff become soul mates while Hindley allows hate and disgust for Heathcliff to fester.  His harsh treatment of his ""brother"" lays the seeds for future misery and death.

Edgar and Isabella Linton are tragic figures caught in the star crossed love of Catherine and Heathcliff. Edgar marries Catherine and Isabella marries Heathcliff.  While Edgar loves Catherine with a passion, she cannot love him with the same passion. Heathcliff cannot love Isabella which brings her a joyless existence.

The secondary story deals with the three offspring.  Hareton, son of Hindley; Catherine, daughter of Edgar and Catherine; and Linton, Heathcliff and Isabella's son are victims in Heathcliff's desires for revenge.  Heathcliff by treachery acquires Wuthering Heights and Hareton as his servant.

Like all gothic novels the characters suffer.  Their lives are destined for misery.

Heathcliff is a tragic hero and villain rolled into a complexity which unravels as he allows his grief for Catherine, his true love, to dominate Wuthering Heights and all of those connected to it.  He is a cruel taskmaster as he relives his childhood abuse in those he torments.  Like a cruel chess master he shows no mercy, no compassion, even for his own son.  When Catherine died many years before, Heathcliff's soul died.  He is now a man with no compassion, no love, no soul, and no light.

Wuthering Heights was the only novel written by Emily Bronte under the name Ellis Bell. Emily was a parson's daughter.  When the truth came out who Ellis Bell was, there was scandal.  How could a single young woman who was a parson's daughter write such sordid details?

The cast is excellent.  This production of 142 minutes is very true to the book and beautifully fimed.  Enjoy!

And as always, the book is a must read. The richness of words cannot be fully captured on the screen.",1287100800,5,2124,5.07514450867052
3762052,4,B001PUTN3Y,"""Wuthering Heights"" the Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of the 1847 publication for the 2009 audience is interesting and holds your interest.  Much artistic license was added to the Bronte novel, but it still  has the strong message of class differences in 19th-century England.

The first scene shows a revengeful Heathcliff, forcing his son (who is dying from a mysterious illness) to marry the daughter of Cathy, who was/is his true and only love.  Heathcliff is then shown digging up the grave of Cathy and hugging a skeleton with huge sobs as he lay in the grave with her.  That may shock the viewer as haunting and gross, but the story then quickly flashes back to when he met her.

The privileged Earnshaw children have a doting father.  He goes out on trips often and  when he returns to their home, Wuthering Heights, usually bring them presents.  As the story opens Cathy (Charlotte Riley)  and her brother are given the gift of a Gypsy step-brother, Heathcliff (Tom Hardy), after one of their father's trips.  They expected other gifts, but got Heathcliff instead.  He is quiet and mysterious, wearing dark and raggy clothes.  There are some hints in the dialogue that Heathcliff is their father's illigitimate son, which would make him a half-brother.  Cathy is a free spirit and a tom boy and enjoys the friendship of Heathcliff as they grow up together.  Her brother, Hindley (Burn Gorman) is insanely jealous and resentful of Heathcliff infringing on his life and possibly his inheritance.  He never forgives his father for bringing him home.  After their father dies unexpectedly, he makes Heathcliff a servant/slave and unfit husband material for Cathy.  Heathcliff and Cathy have a deep enduring love, but Cathy wants security and marries Edgar Linton (Andrew Lincoln) that can provide for her.  This causes repercussions and revenge for generations.

Overall the story is an  engrossing and revived period classic, with beautiful cinematography of Wuthering Heights, Thrushcross Grange, and the Moors.  The cast is fabulous and move smoothly together.  Also, the story is a bit more exciting as it is touched up with a bit of 21st Century passion/carnality.",1286582400,3,2175,5.081920903954802
3762053,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I missed this version of Wuthering Heights on Masterpiece Theatre so I was very happy to find the DVD available.  This is one of the ""classics"" and I thought Tom Hardy was perfect as Heathcliff.",1285459200,2,194,4.542857142857143
3762054,1,B001PUTN3Y,"This is without a doubt the worst adaptation of Wuthering Heights that I have ever seen. The acting doesn't even deserve to be called mediocre. Charlotte Riley is horrible as Catherine. She failed to portray the selfishness, vanity and mercurial nature of the character in the book. Cathy in the book was wild, even after her return. She was prone to temper tantrums and even went so far as to hit Edgar on one occasion. That was not shown in this adaptation. In this Catherine was static, simpering and in some places just seemed plain ignorant. Even in those rare moments when Riley seemed to be trying to display the arrogance of Catherine the performance fell far short. Whoever wrote this script even managed to ruin Cathy's most important speech. That speech was the very reason Heathcliff ran away in the first place, in the book. When he heard Cathy say that it would degrade her to marry him. Yet in this movie Heathcliff heard none of that, Cathy didn't even say it. He ran away without hearing a word of Cathy's confession to Nelly. And they actually had the audacity to change that essential speech which was, in many ways, crucial to the whole tormented existence and doomed love of Cathy and Heathcliff. As I said, it's the reason Heathcliff ran away in the book. They didn't even show how Cathy reacted when Heathcliff left and that was a great disappointment.

The writers for this adaptation saw fit to remove important factors from the book and replace them with unnecessary drivel that never happened, it was just a product of their own imagination and what they thought should be the story. Wuthering Heights is a masterpiece and a classic; it did not need the changes these writers gave it. They took away from the dark tragedy of the book. Heathcliff and Catherine lacked the feral, passionate and, some might even say fatal, obsession that was portrayed in the novel. I saw no chemistry between Charlotte Riley and Tom Harding at all. It was like watching a pair of cardboard cutouts. Painful to watch. Indeed, this was actually so agonizing to watch that I had to leave the computer for a while and only came back when I felt I was ready to endure another dose of sheer torture. The only reason I watched it to the end was because I kept hoping for some redeeming quality on both the part of the script and the actors. There were none. And also because I felt that, however horrible this movie was, it would still be unfair to rate and review it without at least giving it a chance. Well, I gave it a chance. It was horrible. I regret that it took up 2 hours of my life that I shall never be able to get back.

Let's see, all in all, how did this adaptation butcher the book? There are so many ways that I can scarce remember them all.

- Though they did show all three generations, the early childhood life was poorly done. For all the time they gave to it you'd think they could have been more accurate. Instead they drastically changed it and only threw in a few lines from the book (at the wrong time I might add) as if thinking that that would make up for the liberties they saw fit to take

- Catherine displayed far more compassion in this that she did in the book. The Cathy in this book seemed like a completely different person entirely, I just couldn't relate her to the Cathy of the book. Like when she dismissed Nelly from the room. In the book she basically attacked the woman and Edgar, too. In that moment she reverted back into the wild girl of the moors, a girl who felt caged and restricted, until she finally exploded and took out her aggression on both Nelly and Edgar. That didn't happen in this adaptation. We got to see none of Cathy's pent up energy and frustration. In the book she was akin to a caged animal - trying hard to perform for the people around her yet unable to completely contain her true nature. Her volatile personality was terribly diminished in this movie.

- Heathcliff lacked the sinister, yet somehow compelling, charisma that he had in the book. His dark allure was gone in this. And I won't even get into the inaccuracies that the character had to endure at the hands of both actor and writers. There are simply too many. I will only say that in the book, despite his twisted and vengeful nature, he was still a character that I loved, and still love. He was interesting, he was compelling and he was fascinating. In this he just seemed brutish and wooden.

- I won't discuss the sex scenes. I will only say that they degraded the story. They should never have been added.

- As for the ending. All I can see is 'You can't possibly be serious'. It just shocked me. It went completely against the spirit of the book. To say more would be to ruin it for anyone who still wishes the watch this travesty, but far be it for me to give away any spoilers.

My final word? This doesn't even deserve one star, but alas, I was not able to give it zero. I suppose I'll just have to be satisfied with one. My advice would be to watch the 1992 adaptation of Wuthering Heights instead. Ralph Fiennes made a far better Heathcliff and Juliette Binoche at least managed to capture the essence of Cathy far better than Charlotte Riley.",1283644800,56,5189,4.449001051524711

3762061,5,B001PUTN3Y,"Wuthering Heights is a fascinating story of love and obsession. The movie itself was a bit jaunted because they tried to cram too much in too little time and also left out some important stuff. However, the movie was filmed in such a way that it really captured both the darkness and the light of this love story.

The overall feeling you get as you watch the story unfold is a feeling of deep curiosity: What will happen next? How did Heathcliff turn out so wicked? Will he get his revenge? Did they really love each other? Or were they both simply obsessed?

Tom Hardy did a brilliant job as Heathcliff. The more I see of this actor, the more I am impressed with his ability to play these sinister roles. He also impressed me in the movie Oliver Twist.

Charlotte Riley performed brilliantly as Cathy. You can really see the insanity of her obsession in her eyes.

3762066,5,B001PUTN3Y,"When I was in high school, I remember having to read such classics as ""Jane Eyre"", ""The Canterbury Tales"" (a poem), and the John Steinbeck novel, ""East of Eden.""  Each of these great works left its indelible mark and I never forgot them.  When a story sticks with you for years and years, you know it's a good one.  Outside of that, I never ventured much into the reading of classics.  And then I had the good fortune to see Masterpiece Theater's rendition of ""Pride and Prejudice"" on public television a few months ago, a classic that I had never read but thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  So when Masterpiece Theater aired ""Wuthering Heights"" recently, I thought I was in for another treat.

Ignorant as to its storyline, I watched ""Wuthering Heights"" expecting a story more along the lines of ""Pride and Prejudice.""  The longer I watched, the more I expected something good to happen; that the boy who grew up under the loving eye of his caring benefactor and experienced the affection of his vivacious stepsister would overcome past hurts and would somehow make amends with his disaffected stepbrother.

To those who haven't read the novel or watched the movie, you may want to skip the rest of my review as there will be plenty of spoilers.

The heroine, Cathy, was young and inexperienced - yet I felt that she truly loved Heathcliff and was willing to run off with him rather than marry the wealthier Linton.  In her confusion, though, she acknowledges that she would be wealthy, considered a ""great lady"" by the townsfolk if she married Linton; but determines that it's truly Heathcliff whom she loves and could not live without.  Heathcliff overhears her boast of marrying Linton, being rich and considered a ""great lady""; but that's all he hears.  He immediately takes off without saying good-bye and isn't heard from again...until three years later when Cathy finally marries Linton.

I couldn't help wondering...since Cathy waited so long to marry Linton...WHY didn't Heathcliff show up BEFORE she got married, like when he heard of their engagement, just to make sure whether she still loved him or not?  No, he does nothing of the kind.  Instead, he waits until right after their marriage and then shows up to cause trouble.  From then on, Heathcliff is a lost soul who becomes increasingly angry and besotted with revenge.  How he succeeds in destroying everyone around him, including himself, is what makes up the remainder of the movie.

Seriously, I couldn't help but get the feeling that Heathcliff WENT OUT OF HIS WAY to make himself miserable.  I'm not sure I have ever seen a movie (especially one I initially considered a ""romance"") as depressing as this one.

This movie is all about unbridled, obesessive passions; uncontrolled passions geared toward selfish desires and destructive ends.  At every turn, I kept hoping that something would happen that would compel Heathcliff toward regret, restraint, compassion, mercy, kindness, ANYTHING like that...but the more the movie progressed, the worse he became.  Cathy's death was an unmitigated tragedy that, I was surprised, didn't send him over the edge of madness.  Well, it did....eighteen years later.  That it took that long to do so I found unbelievable.  There is a scene where, after Heathcliff nearly kills his stepbrother, his wife tells him that his loving her would have been worse than his having hated her.  That says a lot about the character of Heathcliff.

Another adjective that comes to mind when describing this movie is bizarre.  One of the most bizarre scenes out of a bizarre movie was when Heathcliff, 18 years after Cathy's death, literally digs up her grave, opens her coffin, and sees her lying there - beautiful, untouched by decay, and looking as if she were merely sleeping.  It's only in alternating camera angles that you see her body is nothing but a rotting skeleton, the scene giving the impression that he slept with her during the night.  I was confused as to whether this was supposed to have actually happened, or if he merely dreamed it.

The story of the children...Cathy's daughter, Catherine, now a young woman; Heathcliff's son, a sickly young man who dies not long after his enforced marriage to Catherine (enforced by Heathcliff, no less), and Cathy's brother's son (can't remember his name) who was raised by Heathcliff, is adversely affected by Heathcliff's cloying passion for his dead lover.  When Heathcliff sees Cathy on the stairway landing, he follows her upstairs - and the next thing you hear is the gunshot wound that ends his miserable life.

I suppose the final scene was supposed to convey some sort of ""positive"" ending as Catherine and her cousin walk arm-in-arm toward an awaiting carriage loaded with their belongings, as the supposed ghosts of Catherine and Heathcliff look on.  It, however, didn't dissipate the sadness and depressing atmosphere of the movie - at least, not for me.

Still...I thought the movie was well made, well acted and well written - despite its theme - and for that, I gave it 5 stars.  I'm not sure I've ever watched a Masterpiece Theater production that I didn't think was quality movie-making at its finest.

3762070,3,B001PUTN3Y,"This is a beautifully-photographed but ultimately rather flat adaptation of the classic Gothic romance by Emily Bronte.  There is much to love: a haunting, delicate score, fantastic production values for a project made for television; brooding moors and a real find in newcomer Charlotte Riley, who makes a fetchingly fiesty gamine and suitably northern Cathy Earnshaw.  For me this production stumbles on a few crucial points, however.  Tom Hardy brings a silky menace to Heathcliff which is an interesting take on a famously brutish character, but with his full lips, small squinty eyes and soft features, on the whole I couldn't buy him as Bronte's brutal yet sexy Gypsy.  His delivery was too polished by far for an illiterate stablehand as well, though that served him better in the later parts of the film after Heathcliff has turned himself into a gentleman of sorts.  This version allows Cathy and Heathcliff a few scenes of real passion, but despite them, I didn't quite feel the irresistible animal attraction between this pair.  I was completely thrown by the series' first half hour, which jumped back and forth in time so much I thought I'd accidentally selected the second half of the program.  The familiar beginning is completely gone.

I may be in the minority by preferring the 1992 theatrical version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes.  Fiennes succeeded rather better at Heathcliff's cruelty, but also his passion.  Charlotte Riley is a more authentic Cathy in terms of her heritage, but Binoche offers a more nuanced performance; contrast the 'My love for Edgar is like the foliage in the woods; time will change it.  My love for Heathcliff is like the eternal rocks beneath . .'speech of the two for proof. Ms. Riley still has some growth ahead of her as an actress.

People often forget that Nelly is the narrator, and therefore the heart of the novel, since she is so often given a background role in the cinematic treatments, but it's crucial that Nelly be a strong character, functioning as she does as confidant and conscience of the entire household--essentially a mother to all.  Sarah Lancashire's meek and mousy portrayal of a fairly standard 19th century household servant can't touch Janet McTeer's maternal yet fiery perfomance in the earlier film.  The other supporting characters are conventionally-done as well, though no expense has been spared in the period costumes and detail.  Worthwhile if you are a Wuthering Heights fanatic, but in my view, the 1992 version was the definitive one, making this one, at best, redundant.",1254700800,5,2569,5.025943396226415

3762077,3,B001PUTN3Y,"I believe this 2009 adaptation captured the essence of Emily Bront's novel better than the 1992 adaptation. However, the 1998 is still my favorite. However, I am NOT saying this adaptation was very different from the 1998. (In many respects, the films are nearly identical. Most of the same scenes are shown in each adaptation.)

None of the adaptations could be considered true miniseries where the novel is acted out in entirety. (I an certain many people would find that boring.) Therefore, I am not writing this review as a critique of how well this film or any other film can substitute for reading the novel. What I am saying is that I think the 1998 Masterpiece adaptation is better in telling in the story.

My Main Reasons:

1.
While this adaptation is slightly longer, I don't really think it developed minor characters any better than the 1998. (It does possibly develop Joseph's character slightly more but not Nelly's.)

2.
Some scenes in the 1998, for example, Heathcliff hanging a dog by the hook or trashing Thrushcross Grange after Linton's death showed Heathcliff's hate, grieve, etc. better than the alternative gambling scenes in this 2009 film.

3.
The conclusion of this film is a letdown. The 1998, and even the 1992, end better than this film. In this adaptation, I feel I am being led to think, ""Now Heathcliff is dead and can be with Catherine"" rather than focusing in Catherine II's future and happiness.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
I am not saying I do not recommend this film. Certainly, for someone who loves Emily Bront's ""Wuthering Heights"" and enjoys watching film adaptations. this individual can probably find something in the film he or she likes. I know that the film was interesting to watch once, if not simply to compare with previous adaptations.

However, for the adaptation I would most like to watch MORE THAN ONCE, the 1998 adaptation (not the 2009) is my choice.

Wuthering Heights focuses on Catherine and Heathcliff, two main characters of Bronte's book who have a fundamentally unhealthy, self-centered, obsessive fascination with eachother.

There were just so many things that bothered me this time around.

1. The expendability of the welfare and emotional well-being of secondary characters.

2. How Heathcliff couldn't get past his hateful mentality to choose not to make those around him miserable. Instead, he is as bad as his own tormentors (and worse) terrorizing not only them, but also innocent people who have done nothing to him.

3. Heathcliff offering little to no genuine compassion or forgiveness to anyone (namely besides Catherine). Even when he was shown compassion throughout the story (i.e, being adopted by Mr. Linton, recieving presents from Mr. Linton, being loved by Catherine, Nelly, and Linton. Sure, he was treated horribly. He still could have had it much worse though).

4. Catherine's dependancy upon Heathcliff. Prioritize a man over the well-being of her own child?

5. Catherine is doted upon by almost all of the male figures. She can make mistakes(i.e publically disrespect and humiliate her husband in his own home, run around like a banshee in an conservative age where males and etiquette had authority, and marrying a man she didn't love for the comfort of his money). She uses people and disrupts almost everyone's life because of their love affair and manages to live a life free of the stress of wondering where her next meal would come from or where she would sleep. Yet when Isabella makes the same mistake, she is shown no mercy at all.

It seems like the tragedy is that their relationship is existing at all. Although I no longer find the story appealing, I will admit that Emily Bronte wrote a good tragedy. The movie was good enough/okay.",1242345600,3,2090,4.9684813753581665
3762082,4,B001PUTN3Y,"As someone who has studied Wuthering Heights  at University level, works as a Librarian and read the book many times I consider this film version to be the best I have seen. Though it departs from the plot at times it still comes closest to the the themes and tone of Emily Bronte's work. I can, in fact, understand and accept all of the changes. Even the altered ending doesn't detract - in the novel Heathcliff yearns for death so he can be with Cathy - and having him shoot himself resolves some of the problems presented by the concept of a strong man in his prime willing / starving himself to death in a matter of days.
The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the curious ommission of most of the powerful dialogue from Cathy's death scene. The actors playing Cathy and Heathcliff would certainly have been able to do it justice. Particularly Tom Hardy, who was brilliant and ""nailed"" Heathcliff. I will be suprised if any actor in the future does a better job",1240099200,11,971,4.424581005586592
3762083,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I love the English classics and eagerly anticipate all of their remakes, but this version of ""Wuthering Heights"" was exceptional! Absolutely beautiful to watch and listen to. The soundtrack was reminiscent of England's production of ""HEATHCLIFF"" starring Cliff Richard. Very pretty. If any one knows if the soundtrack is available for purchasing, please contact me. I would appreciate it immensely! Thank you.",1239840000,2,409,5.612903225806452
3762084,5,B001PUTN3Y,"The beauty of the Masterpiece Theater production of Pride and Prejudice (with Colin Firth) is that it was so ""spot on"".  For most, it is the definitive production of Jane Austen's most famous novel and makes thinking of Darcy in any other way almost next to impossible.

But interpretating a great novel and its iconic characters in a different way is the fun of it all.  What did Emily Bronte really mean by it, and did she herself know?  Do we know more than the author; or did the author know more than us? As Heathcliff says here, ""Where's the harm in it?"" If one has done their homework and has read the original, enjoying other possibilities or even taking literary license is all the more compelling and revealing.  So this newest rendition of Wuthering Heights, while less faithful to the novel, is all the more enjoyable for being so.

The sreenplay's author has taken liberties with the story that strike a chord.  The DVD version is more enjoyable and does far more justice to Hardy's Heathcliff than TV version with its awkward and unbalanced separation a week or two apart.

I had never knowingly seen Tom Hardy before and, therefore, could not compare his Heathcliff with any of his other work.  There is no question that his performance dominated the production and, all the more so because Cathy, as portrayed by Riley, was more waiflike than the novel portrays her.

Hardy's Heathcliffe is dark and vengeful to be sure.  But his Heathcliffe is a also a product of repeated and devasting loss, abuse, self-loathing, and self-protection.  He and Cathy are starcrossed characters as much or more than they are products of free will.  As Heathcliffe says here, ""I could have been a good man"".

Heathcliff may be hateful and vengeful.  But Hardy plays him throughout with humanity.  For those seeking to look at the story in a different way, his Healthcliff is vulnerable, tragic, redeemable and truly victimized.  Perhaps not Bronte's portrayal exactly, but another view and way to continue to enjoy a great story of the ages.",1238889600,6,2039,4.796561604584527
3762085,5,B001PUTN3Y,"Wuthering Heights was one of my favorite novels from my youth.  I never particularly appreciated the Olivier film because Olivier himself did not in the least fit the physical conception of Heathcliff my mind had created when I read the novel.  Tom Hardy, however, mostly certain DOES play the perfect incarnation of Heathcliff:  His performance is passionate and exceptional, and he has a deep, powerful, resonant voice that reminds me of what I first noticed about the late Heath Ledger.  Hardy portrays Heathcliff as I think Bronte might have envisioned him:  Darkly handsome, powerful, dangerous, an undercurrent of evil obsessed with vengeance,  a commanding and compelling presence in every single scene, and strongly sensual beneath it all.  Unfortunately, I did not not feel Charlotte Riley  was the right actress for Cathy because she simply did not match Hardy's intensity and presence.  Riley is lovely and a good actress, but somehow she did not come across believably as the type of woman to inspire such undying passion in Heathcliff.  She seemed too conventional and reserved to appeal to him, and the various scenes portraying Cathy and Heathcliff running about the hills together was just too tame and was unconvincing as any sort of proof of her wilder side.  Cathy needed to be played by someone with an undeniably wild and uncontrollable nature such as we see in actresses like Angelina Jolie, for example.  Cathy needed to be shown as unconventional and wild, and that simply did not come across as Riley and this production portrayed her.  Heathcliff needed a Cathy who was a match for himself in feminine form, a woman who was a force of nature, so to speak.  Riley was just too tame.  The actress who portrayed Cathy's daughter Catherine actually seemed a bit stronger character compared to Cathy, but even she was a too mild in my opinion.  Other characters in this film were well done, however.

It had been a very long time since I read Wuthering Heights, and I also noted that in this production the way the story line jumped about with the timeline was a bit confusing, and it took awhile before I remembered the details original story and how all the characters related to each other.  If I'd never read the book I would have been quite confused about the relationships.  For example, Heathcliff's son Linton appears early on, but I'd forgotten exactly who he was and who his mother was and what the circumstances of his life were.  All in all, I think Masterpiece Theater would have done better to make this longer by another 2-hour episode, just to flesh out all the missing details that were glossed over a bit too  much for continuity.

Despite the flaws, this production was absolutely gorgeous and the accompanying music was perfect to set the mood, and it was very compelling to watch.  Good enough that I've ordered the film to re-watch it, mainly because of Hardy's wonderful performance.  He really was the perfect Heathcliff, the one I've imagined all my life.

For those who haven't read the novel, this really is one of the most intense love stories ever written.  The author Emily Bronte wrote only this one novel, which was published in 1847, only about a year before her death at age 30.  The nature of the story supposedly created quite a flap in British society at the time it was first published.",1236384000,6,3345,4.82280701754386
3762086,5,B001PUTN3Y,"To be honest, I had never heard of this novel or author before seeing the special on PBS. And to be brutally honest, I just don't have the attention span to read novels or watch movies all the way through (which would explain the former). But this movie grabbed me from the opening scenes and never let go. Before I knew it, I was lamenting that I had to wait a week to see the conclusion. Not a minute of time was wasted.

The underlying theme of a lifelong relationship based on true love being trumped for a relationship based upon financial stability or social standing is nothing new, but the intensity of the passion and agony conveyed by the actors in this adapted screenplay was painful and palpable. The dramatic lighting, landscapes, and top-notch cinematography just add to the aura. I've never seen a movie that describes the two cliches, ""love hurts"" and ""life isn't fair,"" better than this one.

But of course, there wouldn't have been a screenplay if it weren't for the novel. And that's where I have to give this movie the biggest credit - it inspired me to actually go out and buy the novel so I could read the story in the author's very own words. Of course, Emily Bronte gets all the credit, and even though the Masterpiece Theater version of  the screenplay isn't as true to the novel as many purists wished it were, it won't matter to viewers who have never read the book. Masterpiece Theater told this story in a way that was very moving and personable to me, while introducing me to a classic piece of European literature which I would have had no interest in pursuing had I not seen their screenplay. And that's the beauty of it - I now have both the screenplay and novel versions to enjoy. I can combine what I like best about the two versions and make my own unique version.

Finally, I think it would be a tragedy not to use Masterpiece Theater's adaptation to introduce ""Wuthering Heights"" to anyone unfamiliar with Bronte's novel based solely upon the three very brief, hardly-nude sex scenes. The ""explicitness"" of the scenes pales in comparison to what kids can see on TV during daytime and primetime TV. Furthermore, I think they will be helpful for people unfamiliar with the novel to clarify the quality of the intimacy between the characters. What happens in public and what happens in private can be two very different things The screenwriter could have just broke to the next scene as soon as the the characters closed the bedroom door (and left me guessing), but because they chose not to lock me out, I knew for certain that:

1. Catherine and Heathcliff both enjoyed their intimacy and were indeed able to consummate their relationship with each other even though they weren't married together. Both had clothing on.

2. Catherine did not enjoy her intimacy with Edgar who rushed to have sex with her after Heathcliff returned. This scene also left no doubt in my mind that the child Catherine would later carry could definitely be Edgar's and not just Heathcliff's (after all, Catherine had rendezvous with Heathcliffe after Catherine had committed to Edgar - potentially raising doubts as to the father). This scene also had the most exposed skin and it was only of Edgar's hairy back. Catherine had a gown on.

3. Neither Heathcliff or Isabella enjoyed their intimacy which Heathcliff clearly used as an act of revenge as he could not bear to look at Isabella's face during their intimacy. Both had clothing on.

The above is not of consequence for those who have read the book before seeing this particular adaptation, which is why they may view the scenes as inconsequential parts of the screenplay. But because this screenplay was my first exposure to the novel, and given the non-linear storyline which can make it hard to follow at times, the scenes above added to the intense senses of love, loss, and hate which the characters felt, the actors portrayed, and I the viewer experienced.

What a great discovery of a brilliant novel and author! Thanks Masterpiece Theater!",1235174400,5,4019,4.713675213675214
3762087,5,B001PUTN3Y,"I have always meant to read the original version of Wuthering Heights, but have not yet. When this adaptation appeared as a two-part series on Masterpiece Classic, I jumped at the chance to acquaint myself with the story.

The actors are gorgeous and emote a passion which was almost palpable.  When I watched this a second time (after knowing the storyline), the part in the beginning where Heathcliffe reflects on his life while catching a glimpse of the young Catherine in the window, made me weep. The sex scenes were brief, not gratuitous, and done in good taste. I truly appreciated them!

I do not embrace ""trash tv"" (as a previous reviewer described). Rather, I am thankful for this version as I now endeavor to search out the original story, and am eager to watch as many different film versions as I can find. Thank you BBC!",1234742400,2,834,4.659863945578231
3762088,1,B001PUTN3Y,"This ill-conceived, embarrasingly executed and generally dismal butchering of a literary masterpiece wasn't worth the 1 star rating I gave it, but zero star ratings aren't an option with Amazon reviews (perhaps they should be).

Where to begin - unforgiveably bad, wooden acting, bad pacing, worse screenplay, no direction, zero character development. I can't recall a more dislikable and evil character than Tom Hardy's Heathcliff(necrophilia?) or a more grating and obnoxious Catherine than Charlotte Riley, whose overall amateurish performance and often embarrassing histrionics seem more befitting an elementary school play, prompting one to wonder what she did with the money her parents gave her for acting school.

In the end, we don't care two pins for the fate of this star-crossed pair because they are truly self-absorbed and utterly unlikeable characters whose emotional connection and obsession with each other is never successfully established nor in any way believable.

And as far as character development goes, this entire mess is completely devoid of it (case in point - Hareton shows up as an adult somewhere towards the end and, though there was never any back story on the connection between Hareton and Healthcliff, you're expected to ""get"" the former's devotion to this twisted madman and well up with emotion when he flings himself sobbing on Heathcliff's corpse in the final scene. Ummmm.....no. Not buying it. The silly black eye makeup on Tom Hardy's face and gory splattering of fake blood everywhere just serves to underscore the absurdity of it all.

Clearly this ghastly reinterpretation was intended to pander to a considerably less discerning audience  - a generation raised on trash TV.",1233964800,19,1720,5.355555555555555
3762089,5,B001PUTN3Y,"This adaptation is a fresh rendering that focuses on the complex passions of the two main characters. As a former college professor, I found it difficult to engage my students in reading the novel instead of Cliff's Notes. I think this film version of the novel would definitely inspire those not used to reading 19th century lit to attack the novel with new eyes. I say fresh rendering because the torrid love/hate relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy is the core of the film. It is also about abandonment, including Cathy's. The film is not burdened by the triple narratives of the book. The novel is a Gothic one, but the film dispenses with the supernatural elements that would seem distracting if included.  Heathcliff's plea to the dying Cathy to haunt him so they can still be together, Cathy's plea that he let her die in his arms,imagining that she would be tossed out of heaven for loving him too much, the etchings on the wooden wall reading Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Linton, Catherine Heathcliff, all of these hint at the resignation of the lovers that their lives together are doomed.
I am appreciative of the inclusion of carnal scenes, implicit and explicit, that are merely intimated in  the novel. Heathcliff and Cathy tearing each other apart on the crag where they had earlier ""lay with each other"" and Heathcliff's anguished lovemaking to Isabella where he attempts to feel Cathy's body instead of his wife's. ""Turn your face away,"" he tells her.
I thought the actors wonderful. Tom Hardy's embodiment of  the brooding, obsessive Heathcliff is remarkable and the newcomer playing Cathy very good despite shrinking a bit in Hardy's tour de force.
Purists will probably not endorse this version, but it is far and away the best film to capture the essence of the novel, the raw, violent passion between the lovers which is the lynchpin of the story.",1233532800,200,1876,4.8930817610062896
3762090,4,B001PUTN3Y,"I loved this movie when I just recently watched it on pbs. I had read the book about three days before the first part was aired on television, so I could compare the movie fairly to the book. I truly enjoyed this movie so much. The love between Heathcliff and Cathy is truly heartbreaking. I couldn't believe how well the actors in this movie portrayed their characters personalities.

But the fact is that this version is not close to the plot line of the book at all. There are so many little details, and big events that differ very much from what Emily Bronte wrote about. I really didn't mind them that much though except for the story between Hareton and Catherine. I actually liked the way that this movie was put together except for Hareton and Catherine. In the book Catherine despises Hareton with a passion. She can't stand him because she believes him to resemble Heathcliff. She really is quite nasty towards him until the end when she realizes that she loves him. In the movie it is quite the opposite. She is quite kind towards Hareton, and she doesn't despise him in the least. She probably says two unkind things to him in the whole movie when there should have been a lot more.

I much prefer Emily's take on the love between Catherine and Hareton. Because of the fact that Catherine is so unbelievably harsh to Hareton, and she scolds him whenever he gets near her, it makes the end result so much better. Since she is so bent on hating Hareton, and then when he vows he will have nothing to do with her, she realizes how foolish she was thinking that she hated him when she actually loved him more than anything.

I highly suggest that you buy this film because it is a wonderful movie. But if you want a version that is close to the story I wouldn't go with this one. I personally haven't seen the other versions but I bet that they are very close to the original plotline. So I give five stars to the story between Cathy and Heathcliffe, but I give three stars to the story between Catherine and Hareton.",1233360000,5,2026,4.42627345844504

3762092,5,B001PUTN3Y,"This version is extremely satisfying as I found the acting very realistic and believeable, with every scene powerfully executed with full emotion by all the actors. Cathy is quite naive but that is to be expected as she is so very young and can't fully comprehend the long term consequences of her actions/choices. Heathcliff is permanently scarred with abandonment from his youth and together these two form an unbreakable bond early in life that one can undoubtedly see in the few scenes of tenderness exchanged by the two. I enjoyed the ""liberties"" taken with this adaptation as this created an aura of realism unlike any of the others up to this point. One might say the love scenes were unnecessary but the viewer witnesses intimacy of both tenderness and desperation...one feels so very right, the other so pointless, yet they occur.
