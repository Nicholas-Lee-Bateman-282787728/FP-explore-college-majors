8753245,1,B01CJCQC9E,"Dear PBS & all followers,

You've perfectly proven our points of a pathetic, biased, and politically motivated documentary is about the beloved Saudi Arabia. I'll detail the absurd flaws here:

1-  a whole documentary was based on YouTube clips of few wicked incidents of what they called them ""religious police"" - and all of these accused officials have been convicted by court law order which was not mentioned.
2- The documentary then keeps winding over & over only 4 cases of conflict with government authorities, as if the whole country is nothing but represented by these isolated cases.
3- The documentary then keeps its loops around the exact isolated issues mentioned now below in elaboration:

 The blogger [Badawi] which was prisoned not for simple blogging as it was laid out - as he was doing for years and never touched - rather his last blogging(s) associated with organization of mass revolts with his own [later to be his] lawyer involvement in these organizations of revolts & rejection of religion calls (yes they were majority Shi'a even his wife who fled to Canada - except him a Sunni sued by his own father - which I hate to bring it up as they eagerly wanted it to look as a sectarian issue.)

 Non-Saudi African illegal immigrants fighting with each other in the streets (and we see that occasionally as they fight for the money they've collected from begging in the streets), only to be portrayed as violence against Saudi women. Then another supermarket CCTV of a clear Asian in his Punjabi dress involved physically against a conspicuous who woman in her black garment - as she could be another Asian or else - again absurdly claimed to be Saudis. Not to mention that violence which is a universal issue. Note how he was confiscated by security and bystanders (no mention in the narrative.)

In Saudi Arabia women have priority in lines (even if she comes while you've been standing for an hour, she would immediately be served - long gone habit from the US), as well special branches in banking & business halls (for comfort to take-off her hijab covering, and she still can use the Main sections if preferred). The ""High Consulting Council"" (equivalent to the House of Parliament), is made up of 30% representation by Saudi Women from the society with full voting rights. Saudi Women can be nominated & elected for ""City Municipal Council"" that is concerned with Municipality related issues & decisions. Currently there are 12 Women in such councils.

 Again & again the driving issue for women, which is consumed to no limit. King Abdullah (peace be upon his soul) himself plainly said it in a BBC interview; ""driving for women is happening in rural area for long time, and no law objects to it and it will come in urban cities but in the right timing"". We know our country and the perfect pace for reforms. Only 60 years ago girls education was a ""weird idea"" to the simple traditional tribal society (homeschooling were the known form for girls), only now ladies & girls exceeded the number of their counterparts gender with full scholarships for abroad education & career opportunities.

 Beheading only performed in very limited cases of full proven murderers after full ""High Court"" attested trial with appeals pursued, as well exhausting all possible means of pardon. The documentary failed to mention that over a two year span such sentences were not over 5-8 at Max. in average (except this year with huge jump of 47 executions due to the terrorism circumstances). The exact similar death sentences mode of beheading was in Europe & North American continent since known until only a century ago. Still many modes of current death sentences (lethal dosing, electric chair, etc.) comes with more horrific outcomes to the convict(s) and the officials.

 46 of the sentenced to death were terrorists from Al-Qaeda & affiliated with ISIS that perpetrated horrific crimes (took the lives of many innocent citizens and dear fellow foreign employees some were Americans), and the documentary only focus on the convict # 47 (the Shi'a cleric)!!! What kind of a message they are inciting here?! Many US families of the innocent victims of those crimes committed by these savages (47) felt thankfulness and comfort to the Saudi move in its execution (as they were in trial for nearly 3 years). I would feel the same comfort if they took one of my beloved family (God forbid.)

The exact son of Al-Nimir (the executed Shi'a cleric) and his cousin were fully sponsored for a scholarship of higher education in the US & Europe with full paid tuitions, health insurance, and monthly stipend to himself - the student - and additional payments to his family - wife & children (PBS can easily verify that well-known and publicly stated by officials), by the beloved Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

 Music: you hear it everywhere and music stores with latest hits (Western & Arabian) as well latest movies are in almost every corner. Saudi Arabia has many lead singers that are well-known in the Arab world. Do you see wicked isolated religious extremist (isolated with no affiliation) come and protest?! Yes as every place has a bunch of those. Does he dare touching you or your stuff?! Hell no!! If he did that is a felony in the law. This is a rare randomly seen. So PBS passed through hundreds of such music & movie stores blindly, and narrated a blurred story of guys abused due to playing music??!! The narrator goes further mentioning his fingers were broken??!! Where is the proof by medical officials and why he didn't report that to the authorities??!! Wonderful fairytale.

Then here is a child reading verses from the Quran to be weirdly translated by PBS as if they are expert in religious translation. Besides when you pause the picture the book the child is reading in Arabic is telling: ""never to commit a felony upon fellow Muslims and as well people of the book and innocents""!! Where is that in the translation or what the child is actually reading (PBS can fool non-Arabic experts but not the Arabic language speakers - again pause the picture & read the text in the book)??!! School Text books are available online, download them and translate whatever and see yourself.

 Finally, the absurd way of filming illegal immigrants escaping from the eyes of the authorities in hideous slums (as the documentary called it), and ending up as beggars in the streets or performing cheap labor illegally. They came with limited visa for holy places visit only to remain once their main intended visit is expired to be then called an illegal immigrant(s). The documentary perpetrates them as Saudi Citizens hit in poverty due to low oil prices for few months. A country with the most lucrative place for work & competitive salaries and a monetary surplus fund of over 760 billion is affected by few months of oil prices in mid $30s per barrel. This country survived stronger than ever in much harder time (70s & 90s) with oil prices as low as $8 per barrel for years.

Whomever watch this fully biased & politically motivated documentary thinks that Saudi Arabia is an ISIS oasis, and/or mass majority of Saudi Citizens are oppressed and hungry for freedom (by dissent movement in Qatif which is the size of Disney land - and yes Shi'a majority - blown up upon the whole country (third of the US in size) and its 26 million citizens!! What kind of logic is that?!

Where is the nice caff shops with families mixed and having wonderful time?! Where is the beautiful beaches and picnic gardens with mixed genders & families?! Where is the restaurants, shopping malls, sports arenas for ladies & for the gentlemen?! Where is the superb desert camps, horseback ridings and camel's adventures?!

This documentary reminded me with a wisdom saying: ""if your house is made up of glass refrain hitting stones upon others"".

Simply where is Saudi Arabia in its real sense & aroma in this documentary??!!



[T]errorism & who to really point the finger at:

If Saudi Arabia is same as ISIL (and that's exactly one of the biggest motives to propagate for by this documentary), then please answer these logical ever shouting loudly at you questions;

Q1- Saudi Arabia is being targeted heavily by ISIL, and the Saudi government formed an unprecedented Islamic Coalition to fight terrorism composed of at least 39 Muslim Nations. Saudi Arabia is the one who executed 47 terrorists as clearly stated in this documentary. Explain that?!

Q2- Saudi Arabia was founded since a century long. Terrorism in global manifestation has been clearly observed during the post era of US formation of Afghan fighters (Mujahideen) in the 80s into the 90s by Mr. Zbigniew Brzezinski in Afghanistan - initial nucleus for AlQaeda ever, followed by Iraq invasion and the famous ""Mission Accomplished"" sign in 2003 - nucleus for first ever AlQaeda presence in the beloved Iraq, and then withdrawal from the mess made in Iraq for a perfect platform for ISIL to suddenly appear armed to its teeth with sophisticated armor & media tech. Where is the Wahhabi Saudi Arabia as you called it fit here?!

Q3- Per United Nations report, Iran has the vast majority of AlQaedh fighters in its lands since the US invasion on Afghanistan in 2001-2002. I guess they - AlQaedh fighters & their families - are not in Iran for a political asylum or a tourism vacation.

FACT: Saudi Arabia was first founded in 1774 AD as the 1st dynasty. Do the math of terrorism and Saudi Arabia's (Wahabbism as PBS & others called it) prospective age in answering the questions.

So in summary:

Who really to blame for this global terrorism??!!

Who really created terrorism?! And have the largest safe haven for them??!!

Intellectual questions and analyses demands intellectual mindset for a fruitful righteous answers.

Don't let the media feed you and control your common logic & brain. Take control to these precious things and feed them yourself by legitimate & intellectual sources.

Thank you!",1483228800,11,9959,4.853687315634218
8753246,5,B01CJCQC9E,"People should watch this. Saudi is a terrorist financing state and a terrorist state against its own people and residents, with clear third class citizens status given to women, foreigners and anyone speaking against the regime. As long as the Wahhabism idealogy is coming out of Saudi, threats of terrirosm won't end.
One last thought, Saudi does in no way reflect any aspect of life of other normal Muslim countries. This is not Islam. This is terror + power justified by an insane religious excuse.",1477180800,3,501,4.905882352941177
