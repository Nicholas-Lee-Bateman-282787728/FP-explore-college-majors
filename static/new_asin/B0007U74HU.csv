I hope not, because Paul Valentine is dreamy and I could watch him in this film a hundred times without getting bored. The best part is that he is the lead in this very, very romantic, girly movie. You know he's going to do the right thing and get the girl in the end, but I was still on the edge fo my seat trying to figure out exactly how he would do it. The island location is beautiful and made me want to fall in love with him too!",1148428800,2,502,3.8365384615384617

She looks like she is about 15, but is still stunning. The picture itself is a love story about people trapped on a wild island with a fair about of adventure thrown in. Eva makes teh move and I was excited to find this early a picture of her.",1148342400,3,408,3.869047619047619
