Besides being unbelievably short the  CD hangs up and one keeps waiting for the ""meat"" but there isn't much to be had. Instead, read a review of any book on Norway or even just read the introduction or the captions to a dozen pictures out loud; instead you will get more beneficthan we got from this this rotten little DVD.  If I could still return it I would trust me, however I was traveling for an extended period and waited to watch it until I returned home. Now I can't see a 'Return' option or I would; it's 30 days since receipt of  the DVD! Boy, am I sorry about that.",1499558400,,745,4.345323741007194

8219962,1,B000VU44TW,"The video was only 10 minutes long and basically showed churches in the area.  The sound was terrible, a lot of loud ""clicking"" noises.  When I ordered the video, the synopsis was different than what was acutally viewed on the video.  Perhaps, I was sent the wrong item?  It was a gift for an elderly friend from Bergen and needless to say, he was very disappointed.",1300752000,,366,4.5
