1551009,5,B00005JOVA,"This was the best worst show of all time!  You will roll on the floor laughing at the horrible writing, acting, special effects (I think they paid for two of them)!  We NEED this show on DVD!  I have never seen anything funnier in my entire life.  This world needs more genuine unintentionally funny shows.  It covers every cliche and the main character rocks a mean sweater vest!  AWESOME!",1272672000,,390,4.579710144927536

1551012,5,B00005JOVA,"Manimal was the most unique series I have ever seen! The transformation sequence was awesome! I was so pleased when the character showed up on an episode of Nightman a few years ago and would love for that episode to be included in the dvd for this series-believe me,I would buy it in a heartbeat!",1194220800,7,297,4.418181818181818
1551013,4,B00005JOVA,I don't even remember why I remember this show. I can't wait for this to come out. This will go on the shelf right next to my Attack of the Killer Tomato movie collection!,1180915200,,171,4.0588235294117645
1551014,1,B00005JOVA,"I can't wait for this DVD to come out.  I used to watch this show when I was a kid with my Dad.  He used to laugh and laugh at how bad it was.  I wish it would be released before Father's Day, it would make a great gift.",1173484800,,220,3.4489795918367347
1551015,5,B00005JOVA,"I watched this when I was a kid, and then caught it again a few years ago on SciFi.  It was by far the best bad TV I've ever seen.  I was literally on the floor, clutching my sides with laughter.  I would buy this in a heartbeat were it available.  To quote the movie Edward Scissorhands, ""I'd give my left nut to see that again""",1146009600,7,329,3.9393939393939394
1551016,5,B00005JOVA,There has been a hole in my life for the last 23 years since the show was cancelled and I believe it is time this hole was filled. If this DVD is released I would then be able to stop taking the medication.,1143417600,18,206,3.813953488372093

7941381,5,B00005JOVA,"I'm still waiting!!! Forget DVD - Put it on Blu - ray! I adored this series as a kid. As a horse lover, one of the episodes that stands out is the horse transformation and the rider ""schooling"" him. Afterwards, he admitted to be a ""bit sore."" So release it already!",1449100800,,265,4.215686274509804

7941385,2,B00005JOVA,I did not realize that a DVD for Region 2 would not play on my DVD player.  I was unable to watch the DVD and am very disappointed.,1392681600,3,131,3.6785714285714284

7941387,5,B00005JOVA,"I was only eight years old when I ran across this series on NBC in 1983. I have to admit Simon MacCorkindale was my first crush in my life. He was so handsome, and I loved that ability to change into animals. The drawback in that time, the special effects could afford for only the hawk and the panther. Also, it was killed after only eight episodes because it went up against Dallas on Friday nights (MAJOR mistake at the time). Just recently, I went to Dragon Con in Atlanta, where there was a panel celebrating Manimal's 30th anniversary. We even did a Manimal chant, which was loads of fun. I would LOVE to see the eight episodes come out on DVD here in the U.S. someday, since I'm an 80s kid now and forever!",1379635200,,713,4.288888888888889
7941388,4,B00005JOVA,I loved the show - although I openly admit that some of it was cheesy - turning into an elephant was just to much for me to suspend my belief. But I did look forward to it every week as long as it lasted. The DVD's do exist - just go to UK amazon to find them but they will only work on a regain 2 player. I'm still waiting for my order - so far to no avail.,1337472000,,358,3.5443037974683542
7941389,4,B00005JOVA,"I watched this as a kid and throughly enjoyed the show. Other kids programs have come and gone based on the idea, maybe onew day those with movie money will do a good job on making a series.",1322956800,,190,4.026315789473684
