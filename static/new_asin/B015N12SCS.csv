7443318,3,B015N12SCS,"If you like a lot of fart jokes and a Santa who ends up in prison, you will love this movie.  Santa (Jim Broadbent) gets bumped off course and found by a boy who asks his ex-con dad (Rafe Spall) to help save Santa and Christmas.  For the most part, the film runs the course of no one believing this is really Santa Claus.  The fantasy elements that would persuade you otherwise appear very late in the film.  In between there is a lot of snide, fairly rude humor.  Theres a prison break and a chase sequence requiring Santa to shoot deer-poo-pellets at the police!  If you like non-kid friendly holiday flicks on the salty side..................youre welcome to it.",1451347200,,665,4.546218487394958
7443319,5,B015N12SCS,"GREAT family movie. As I told my daughter, her kids will love it because of the farting reindeer if nothing else. My 14 year old granddaughter laughed out loud numerous times during the movie. It's ridiculous and annoying in some places, but the great parts counteract those and make it a must see movie. I love it.",1451088000,,315,4.543859649122807
7443320,5,B015N12SCS,BEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!!!,1450828800,,38,5.5
7443321,5,B015N12SCS,"BRITISH production, backed by Warner Brothers as I recall.
I'd watch this one as a family though. Starts out with a kid re-
uniting with his father just being released from jail AS Santa
is being put IN!
SOUNDS depressing, but while Santa is in JAIL for this one,
he's put in an INSANE ASYLUM  in another---similar---film I
saw filmed in HOLLAND ""A CHRISTMOOSE STORY"".

Both of these movies are on my recommended for a family
Christmas list. NOT appropreate for todlers though!",1450310400,3,477,4.734939759036145
7443322,5,B015N12SCS,really enjoyable for a whole family to watch,1449619200,,44,4.625
7443323,5,B015N12SCS,"Most Christmas movies are cheap low-budget dramas that are set around Christmas but really have anything to do with the holiday. Rarely do they make movies like Miracle on 34th Street,  Arthur Christmas or Elf that actually are about Christmas.  Get Santa is actually about Christmas and the fantasy that surrounds the holiday. With excellent British flare we get a realistic tale of Santa as he uses a young man and his son to get back to the North Pole before Christmas Eve. Lots of creativity went into all aspects of this movie from writing, acting, production and heart. Jim Broadbent plays an exceptional Santa.  Not the normal Christmas pomp so do yourself a favor and get a copy. You won't be sorry. Great for the entire the family except for the very young.",1448064000,9,766,4.701492537313433

8733960,4,B015N12SCS,"This is a pretty enjoyable British film, where Steve gets out of prison, his ex has a new man, and he has a parole officer who tells him if he doesn't arrive in her office at 5pm every day, he's going back to jail.  On the first night of his release his son rings him to say Santa is hiding in his garage and has asked Steve to come over to help him get his seized reindeer back. When the son refuses to give the phone to his mother, and tells him he's going back out to the garage, a concerned for his son's safety Steve, speeds to his ex's house to save his son from the creepy old man telling him he's Santa.  At the garage after assaulting Santa, Steve is more convinced he's just an insane old man rather than a threat to his son, and since he as well needs to hide from his wife when she calls her son inside, he does but Santa is gone when he emerges.  Later news footage will show them the old guy in the garage was arrested while trying to see-saw jump his reindeer over a fence.  Steve is allowed to visit his son the next day, but his son blackmails him, that he will only go with him if they go and visit Santa in prison.  Steve reluctantly agrees, Santa at the prison tells the boy to go find Prancer at the new location his reindeer have been moved to, Prancer will know what to do and can communicate with him.  Steve still doesn't believe the old man is Santa but again does what his kid wants.

That's pretty much what the rest of the movie is as well.  Steve doing what he needs to, so he doesn't loose his son's want to hang out with him.  His son always believing the old man is Santa. The police of course not liking what the two are doing.

There's a few holes in the story (spoilers obviously) such as why would Santa still be wearing his red suit when he goes into general population.  Surely street clothes are discarded as part of the check in process. Not you just change in your cell like in this movie. When Santa is in prison he comes across an inmate with dwarfism who he berates for not being at work.  Now Santa has a backstory for every other person he encounters where he goes into a spiel about what they asked for when they were kids and what happened to that present.  Why would he not have the same thoughts occurring for a guy with dwarfism? He should have instantly known he wasn't an elf. Even more so when we see the elves, and they don't look like people with dwarfism.

But the holes in the story don't matter for overall enjoyment. It is a kid's aimed family film, so there's a lot of missed opportunities on what could have happened to Santa behind bars storyline wise and in other areas.  But still, this is definitely an a kid saves Christmas plot that is as good as any other out there.",1513468800,,2736,4.15530303030303

8733962,4,B015N12SCS,"A fun story with some surprising warm moments with hardened cons and uptight cops.  Watching this Santa will make you believe again--he is great.  A little bit of everything in this movie, chase scenes, northern lights, trip to Lapland, high technology logistics, Elves, and at the core a son and his ex-con dad work to save Christmas.",1483228800,,335,4.859649122807017
