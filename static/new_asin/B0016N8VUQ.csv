8263463,5,B0016N8VUQ,This item was a gift for my son. I found on his wish list selections. I asked him how it was and he said it was very good. My son has taken Martial Arts training since he was five. He is very happy with Armor Plated and after all these years of learning he is finding technique and new and effective material that extends his knowledge base. If he likes it I recommend it. Shipping was quick and it was in good shape. Thank you.,1388275200,,428,4.047058823529412
8263464,5,B0016N8VUQ,"I have had the pleasure of reviewing most of Hatmaker's books and videos over the years.  His vast knowledge of boxing and grappling is always amazing to me. This DVD is different from his previous ones because it deals primarily with the defensive skills required to win the fight.  He does not go into any detail how to box or grapple and suggests you view his other material for specific instructions on these fighting arts.

The first thing he emphasizes is to relax and do not get angry during the sparring exercises with your partner when you get hit.  Keeping your hands up and being alert at all times in these exercises is essential.  He recommends doing one 3 minute round for each of these drills and to move around.  Personally, I strongly advise you to begin with doing one minute rounds for each drill unless you are in fantastic shape.  Boxing and/or grappling for three minute rounds is very grueling unless you are in incredible shape.  I personally worked on some of these drills with one of my black belts and they really give you one hell of a workout.  You really learn to keep your hands up during these drills.  The reality of being hit is sometimes the best teacher.

The first defense taught is against the high jab.  The majority of defenses for most of the various types of attacks were the same.  The included the following:
The catch, slap punch, cuff to side, the slip, the pull back, the cross arm block, shoulder block and step back methods were shown to counter the high jab.

The defenses against the cross were the same but also included the cover type block.  The high lead hook included the previous methods as well as duck movement.  Defenses against the upper cut, low jab, and low cross  was also explained.

Using pivoting and shifting methods were emphasized to defend against various attacks.  How to move while jabbing and various techniques to avoid being caught on the ropes was also taught.

In the second disc, boxing clinch drills were shown and how to counter various elbow and head [...] attacks was taught.  Knee and other kicking attack counters were also covered in this comprehensive DVD series.

The final part of this 150 minute series included some basic ground defenses against the mount, side mount, and guard positions.

In conclusion, there is so much information in this DVD set that this review cannot really do it justice.  The information is clear and easy to follow. The drills are practical and will develop your defensive skills.  However,  in my opinion, without some kind of background in the basics of boxing and grappling, it would be difficult for a person to completely understand all this fantastic material.  This series would work best when used in conjunction with training under an experienced instructor.
