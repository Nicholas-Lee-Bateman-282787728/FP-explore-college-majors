7902839,4,B000003KAA,"I really enjoyed this episode of Voyager and highly recommend it, especially to fans of the character of B'Elanna Torres.
Once again, we are awed by B'Elanna's determination and technical expertise as she attempts to disable the Dreadnought missle, which she had reprogrammed herself during her time as a Maquis back in the Alpha Quadrant.  And of course, the whole project is very time-sensitive, because the missle is on a collision course with a populated planet!
This episode is fun because it alot of ways, it portrays B'Elanna trying to outsmart B'Elanna - and that takes some skill!  As you might imagine then, any fan of the character of B'Elanna Torres must see this episode!
And as an added bonus, we get to see some of the strength of character of Captain Janeway, who is prepared to destroy Voyager in order to save the planet.
I give the episode 4 stars, but the only reason I don't give it 5 is because the story doesn't do alot to develop the overall Voyager storyline.  However, it's still an excellent outing and if I could give it 4 1/2, I would!",996019200,2,1064,4.619047619047619
7902840,5,B000003KAA,An encounter with an extremely powerful self guided rocket launched by Torres leaves the crew with very few options to disable it before it  destroys an innocent planet.  In the end it comes down to Torres vs. the  computer program she created.  A great episode of wit and tactics.  A true  model of the star trek genre.  I highly recommend.,968976000,4,341,4.583333333333333
