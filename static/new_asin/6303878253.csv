7855779,3,6303878253,"Lewis Gilbert's ('Damn the Defiant!,' 'Alfie,' 'The Spy Who Loved Me') disappointing seafaring adventure 'Ferry to Hong Kong' (UK, 1959) has a couple major problems apart from the maritime malapropism used in this review's title (taken from the DVD cover).  First, its structure: it tries very hard for the first hour to be a cheeky comedy along the lines of 'Donovan's Reef,' with Curt Jurgens' rough-and-tumble rogue squaring off against Orson Welles' fussy blowhard of a ship's captain.  There are lots of brawls and lowbrow insult-trading, which get a little tiresome by the time the high-stakes drama settles in in the second half, and by then you've kind of had it with both of these dislikeable ne'er-do-wells and their antics, so it's difficult to switch gears and suddenly give a damn about them (and the somewhat preposterous troubles they find themselves in on the back end of the film are so dire you're left scratching your head wondering what happened to the lighthearted romp you've been watching).  Second, there's Welles' performance: it's for the most part intentionally hammy (he's looking appropriately pink and porcine for the role), but he plays it so broad-- somewhere between Charles Laughton and Lou Costello with a badly looped cockney accent that appears and disappears sporadically-- that it reduces the character to a cartoon.  He was adrift at this point in his career, and it shows in his work here.  Those rather substantial misgivings aside, FTHK is a modestly entertaining time-passer, attractively appointed and photographed (in CinemaScope), and capably edited by another future Bond director, Peter Hunt ('On Her Majesty's Secret Service').  Picture is reasonably sharp and artifact-free with some color-fading evident, formatted by VCI in non-anamorphic (letterboxed) widescreen.  Film rates 2 1/2 stars, presentation 3-plus.",1390867200,3,1863,5.381443298969073
7855780,4,6303878253,Wells plays the dupe in this one.  something I have not seen before.  Jurgens without his shirt is almost worth the price ! It is almost a comedy that seems to be looking for an ending.  thank you for the captioning.,1382313600,,216,4.219512195121951
7855781,4,6303878253,"I first saw this movie one late night decades ago, back when the networks still showed movies after the 11 p.m. newscasts. It was interesting, like so many old movies that are no longer shown even on the movie channels on cable. I'll leave it for other reviewers to discuss the merits of this movie.

What I do want to say is that the DVD is awful. It's letterboxed, with a 4:3 image that has enormous black bars above and below. For crying out loud, this was finally released on DVD in 2011. Just about everybody had a widescreen TV by then and not having this in anamorphic widescreen is unforgivable. It's no harder for a company to do anamorphic than letterboxed. In fact, virtually all theatrical movie DVDs released in 2011 were anamorphic, and this was one of at most a handful that weren't. Shame on you, VCI Entertainment! But I suppose I should have expected no better. You're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but the artwork on the case is similarly awful. I haven't seen anything like this amateurish jumble since the 1980s. There are no extras on the disc, but I expected none considering everyone involved in its production must have passed away by now.",1376870400,,1177,4.55188679245283
7855782,3,6303878253,"Coming from the era when the Rank Organisation was trying to compete with the Hollywood studios with increasingly lavish international co-productions, Lewis Gilbert's Ferry to Hong Kong is one of those films that's sold as much on its location and CinemaScope colour photography as its story, which ambles along with the tide almost as much as its dishevelled hero. Curd Jurgens is the piece of human driftwood expelled from Hong Kong after one bar brawl too many, only for the Macao authorities to refuse him entry and the British refuse to allow him back into their colony. Not that Jurgens' status as a man without a country worries him half as much as Orson Welles' pompous ferry skipper, who finds himself stuck with a very unwelcome non-paying passenger who's more popular with the passengers and crew than he is. Chief among his allies below decks is Noel Purcell, the engineer with a family in every port, and chief among those on the upper decks on his side is Sylvia Syms' schoolteacher, the kind of dish who naturally is increasingly attracted to the scruffy loser who doesn't want to be redeemed - you know, just like real life...

The story may half-heartedly attempt to forge a then modern-day link with Joseph Conrad's failures running from themselves in the far east, even going so far as to name Jurgens' character Conrad in case people don't make the connection themselves, but there's nothing profound going on here. Not a great deal happens until the ferry runs into bad weather and Milton Reid's pirates in the second half, but it's a likable glossy entertainment with all the stops pulled out and a memorably shifting accent from Awesome. The CinemaScope and vivid Eastmancolor are perfect for the bright neon nights of 50s Hong Kong and the film betrays few signs of its troubled production - more than a few of the problems due to Welles, who, for all his scene-stealing on camera was a nightmare to deal with (pretty much par for the course on any film he didn't direct himself). Expect greatness and you're bound to be disappointed, but if you're looking for an undemanding, handsomely staged melodrama with colourful characters in exotic places doing exactly what you'd expect, the film delivers.

Strawberry Media's PAL UK DVD has no extras offers the uncut version of the film (it was trimmed for international release) in a decent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer which, a few faded shots aside, preserves Otto Heller's vivid Eastmancolor photography surprisingly well.",1333065600,2,2493,4.947494033412887
7855783,4,6303878253,"There is a lot to like about FERRY TO HONG KONG (1959), now available on DVD from VCI Entertainment.

It has an intriguing story, several suspenseful moments, some picturesque Hong Kong locations and a delightful performance by Orson Welles in a definitely unWellesian role.

Curt Jurgens stars as a ""man without a country,"" the black sheep of his family, now a virtual bum and a troublemaker, who sleeps on the street and starts barroom brawls.  When he's kicked out of Hong Kong, the police put him on a ferry, captained by Welles, that travels back-and-forth to Macao.  But, when the Macao authorities won't let him disembark, the priggish Welles, a former conman, is stuck with him...and he hates Jurgens.

During the ensuing weeks and revolving voyages, Welles tries everything he can to get Jurgens off his boat, but with scant success.  The unwelcome passenger also begins a romance with a sympathetic school teacher  (Sylvia Syms) and, eventually, redeems himself with the captain when the ferry encounters a typhoon, followed by a pirate attack.

Lewis Gilbert, who directed several of the James Bond films, co-wrote (with Vernon Harris) and directed FERRY TO HONG KONG.

Aside from being 15-20 minutes too long, my main complaint with the picture is that it can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or an action film.  Virtually the first half of the movie deals almost exclusively with the barbed relationship between Welles and Jurgens, as they exchange banter and Welles continually tries to get rid of his passenger.  Granted, there are some funny moments in this long section, but the stakes are not really raised until well after the middle of the film when we get the typhoon, and then in the final third, the pirates' onslaught.

Overall, I did enjoy the movie, but a bit of foreshadowing in the screenplay that the tone of the picture was going to be changed would certainly have been in order.

Directed by Lewis Gilbert

VCI brings another winner from the British Invasion.

This is a clever film with some nice location shots of Hong Kong as it was during the '50s.

Curt Jurgens who has always appeared in successful films carries this plot.  You may remember him in many of his memorable roles of The Devil's General (1955), And God Created Woman (1956), The Enemy Below (1957), The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958), The Longest Day (1962), Battle of Britain (1969), Lord Jim (1965) and The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)

Special footnote: -- Curd Jrgens (commonly billed as ""Curt Jurgens"" in anglophone countries) was one of the most successful European film actors of the 20th Century.

Fairly good cast with Orson Welles trying to give his best during his decline in the entertainment business.  When you think of Welles with Citizen Kane (1941), Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Stranger (1946), The Long Hot Summer (1958), Third Man (1949) and Touch of Evil (1958) -- of course it's a matter of taste, as I believe those were all winners for Welles.

Once you get past some of the too many words dialog, things start to pick up story wise.  Not a bad film for a lazy afternoon viewing when you have some time on your hands.

7855785,3,6303878253,"1959's FERRY TO HONG KONG is a real odd duck. Starring Curt Jrgens, Orson Welles and Sylvia Syms, the film taps into the fascination that audiences craved for everything exotic and Oriental in the Fifties. It was completely shot on location in Hong Kong (and looks spectacular), but the performances are uneven and the story takes forever to get it's sea legs.

Drunken vagrant Mark Conrad (Jrgens) winds up as a permanent passenger on the ferry belonging to Captain Hart (Orson Welles) because of a legal loophole. On the regular trip from Hong Kong to Macau, Mark meets and befriends schoolteacher Liz Ferrers (Sylvia Syms), who eventually strikes up an inevitable romance.

This film is one of the most peculiar I've seen in a long time. Starting out as some sort of leisurely ""Odd Couple"" comedy, things shift dramatically in the second half when a brush with an exploding junk, a typhoon and an attack by Chinese pirates finally liven up the pace. Orson Welles gives the most problematic performance; I can't completely put my finger on it, but the whole character seems like he's just stepped out of some grotesque pantomime. He spends the last portion of the film with a board strapped to his back (don't ask). Jrgens and Syms are attractive but hardly set the screen ablaze with chemistry. Being shot almost entirely on location meant that a great deal of the dialogue had to be re-looped during post production, and that sadly takes away from the ""immediacy"" of the performances, too.

The co-stars are fine. Jeremy Spenser plays the young 1st officer, Noel Purcell is an engineer with a family in every port(!); and Margaret Withers is a starchy old maid with a few choice one-liners. A minor classic to be sure, but just be patient for the story to gain it's speed.",1307232000,4,1776,4.778501628664495
