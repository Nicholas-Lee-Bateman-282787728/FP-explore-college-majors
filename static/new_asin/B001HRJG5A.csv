3643787,5,B001HRJG5A,"Joshua says...I'm planning on having this DVD for Christmas. All of the episodes sound interesting, but the one that I find the most interesting is the one called ""Real Dragons."" It talks about a giant prehistoric lizard called megalania, and I have loved the megalania ever since I  heard about it! This lizard was definitely a real monster! The size of a bus and weighing over half a ton, this aggressive predator was the king of Australia's beasts!",1258588800,3,451,4.782051282051282
3643788,5,B001HRJG5A,"Television was invented for shows like this.  Absolutely priceless.  Don;t get me wrong, I personally don't really believe any of these cryptids exist.  But these people searching for them is hilarious/awsome.  I recommend you watch each episode with some wine.",1258329600,7,261,5.45
3643789,5,B001HRJG5A,I bought this series for my brother who absolutley loves the series.  I've enjoyed watching them with him too.  They can actually get a little scary to watch.,1250899200,2,158,4.607142857142857
3643790,4,B001HRJG5A,"The second season of MonsterQuest really lived up to the two episode that I saw (giant snakes & giant octopus). There are more episodes than the first season and more variety of monsters. The monster team used more hi-tech equipment this time around and even followed up on some evidence acquired during the last season. Some episodes didn't really have much photographic or hard evidence besides eye witness accounts, but the show did a good job of presenting their own theory as to what the creature could be or how a creature of that size might exist. Using scientific and historic data, the show really saved those episodes from just being about hearsay. It seems like the time frame for each investigation is about a week. I know they probably have a limited budget, but if given more time to the researchers, maybe they would come out with actual photos or concrete evidences. This is definitely an improvement over the first season but more evidence should be included(if possible) to make it even better. Great collection for people who enjoy shows like this. Looking forward to season three.",1240617600,,1100,4.8563829787234045
3643791,5,B001HRJG5A,"When the History Channel aired Monster Quest, I was fascinated especially since the material presented wasn't the old rehashed stories.  I missed the opportunity to see the stories from Monster Quest II.  It was while deployed to Iraq.  So, while oversease, I ordered the video.  I was pleased.  Thanks.",1235260800,,303,5.1020408163265305

3643793,5,B001HRJG5A,"These monster Quest shows are the best. I've seen them all on tv. Some I like a lot better that others but they're all well worth owning. A ""must have"" if you enjoy this kind of thing. I sure hope that we get a Season three. If anyone from the History Channel is reading this review. Thank you for giving us these great shows. And PLEASE make a Season Three!",1229817600,,358,4.128571428571429

3643795,5,B001HRJG5A,"Aliens, monsters, Big Foot - love them all. And this show has a wide range of myths and legends, which kept me riveted. Not an in-depth scientific investigation. These are people who have a passion and a theory and I enjoyed going along on the ride with them.",1453939200,,259,4.416666666666667

3643805,5,B001HRJG5A,"I love monster quest. Even though they never really see the ""monsters"" or get a real answer, I feel like we learn something new and it is entertaining. I watch with my kids on rainy days, and they enjoy it as well  (7 & 9), it's not too scary or old for them.",1430956800,,259,3.8867924528301887
3643806,5,B001HRJG5A,"Great TV Series and a must have for people who follow the latest on Sasquatch, Bigfoot, and other undiscovered mysteries. This TV series was cancelled by History Channel, which is a shame because I think it was a great series which approached the subject with a very scientific approach and includes a lot of real eye witness encounters which supports the existence of many of the creatures discussed.",1429315200,,401,4.911764705882353

They didn't have cable and they always said really sounds interesting that they would look into it. . .well, I couldn't wait so I purchased it for her and her hubby. . .GUESS WHAT, they like the series so much they ended up getting DIRECT TV so they can see it up there in the mighty Rockies. . .So I'd say GREAT PURCHASE, changed some minds out there!",1371686400,,417,4.085365853658536

3643811,3,B001HRJG5A,"""MonsterQuest"" is a series originally aired at History Channel. It's devoted to cryptozoology, a subject both fringey and goofy. I admit that the series is too boring for my infotainment tastes - I mean, the MonsterQuest team never actually finds a monster! Still, the second season is often unintentionally funny. In the ""Grassman"" episode, a couple of Bigfoot enthusiasts try to lure the elusive ape-man into attacking a gigantic gorilla mask made out of plastic! They also attempt to establish contact with the creature by imitating its supposed mating calls. Needless to say, none of the methods are successful. Perhaps Bigfoot isn't aroused by Halloween costumes?

In another classic episode, the MQ team travels to Texas in search of Hogzilla, a hog supposedly four times the normal size. A regular hog runs off with the team's expensive camera, while a cranium of a supposed mega-hog turns out to be the skull of a Belgian Blue-type domestic pig. Apparently, the gigantic pig escaped from its owner (well, it was meant for slaughter, so who can blame it?) only to be killed by some crazy Texan cowboys on the look out for Hogzilla!

I admit that I laughed almost all evening after seeing *this* episode. I also liked the quirky ""tough guy"" act of the hunters: ""It'll kill'ya. Then, it'll eat'ya"". Well, I'm not so sure, LOL.

The most fascinating episode is about the Chupacabra, the legendary Goat-Sucker of Puerto Rico, who seems to have spread itself to the southern parts of the United States in the good old fashion of fire ants, killer bees and so-called illegal aliens. Here, the monster hunters actually manage to find some pretty bizarre animals killed by Texan ranchers. DNA tests and other analyses show that the ""goat-suckers"" are really feral dogs or dog-coyote hybrids, probably suffering from mange. I admit a certain disappointment...

Another fascinating episode dealt with the so-called Black Beast of Exmoor, one of the few cryptids taken seriously by the authorities. Apparently, a group of British marines were once ordered to find and catch the mystery feline supposedly lurking on the moor. Needless to say, they had to leave empty-handed. As the proverb goes, ""the missing link is still missing"".

Many other episodes were so ludicrous that I stopped watching, such as the claim that rats the size of cats live in New York City. Rats are surprisingly large (I was surprised the first time I saw a dead rat), so this is an obvious case of misjudging their size - perhaps from people who assume that the average rat is the size of a pet mouse.

I'm not sure how to rate the second season of ""MonsterQuest"", but since I was entertained by Hogzilla & The Grassman (sounds like a hip hop band), I give it three stars, but I suspect that's really a bit too much...",1351123200,5,2789,4.848739495798319
3643812,4,B001HRJG5A,"There are some interesting stories in season two, but interesting stories are only a small part of the series' appeal. MonsterQuest is not unlike other cryptozoological/paranormal series that have cropped over the years: it depends on what I call ""the roller coaster principle""; that is, the dramatic build up of suspense before a commercial break and the inevitable--but short-lived--letdown afterward. I find this pattern utterly predictable and somewhat amusing. I constantly look for the queues used by the show's creative staff to set up ""don't look behind that door"" moments. It can be fascinating to watch those queues subtly influence fellow MonsterQuest viewers (I know, it sounds sick). I have to admit that I am a fan of cryptozoology, so it isn't always the showmanship that gets me hooked.",1336176000,,802,5.224806201550388
3643813,4,B001HRJG5A,"I did eventually get this season from Second Spin retailer through Amazon, but it took so long that I asked for my money back. Murphy's law, the item turned up several days later. Had to chase up a repayment, what a hassle, but upon watching a few episodes, the pain slowly went away.

The Ghost episode is quite good. They investigate the Gettysberg ghost video, which is probably one of the best pieces of video evidence of ghosts we have today.

This series is very informative and interesting to watch, though the teams never seem to find anything concrete. Love the Real Dragons episode with Rex Gilroy, the Aussie Cryptozoologist. His one liners are awesome! Rex, (if you read this review)that Brisbane Museum guy doesn't know what he's on about!

Recommended series for the serious cryptonut!

Worth getting!",1322611200,,815,4.884057971014493

8309417,5,B001HRJG5A,"Excellent series investigating the paranormal creatures and events that plague our planet. It is a true crying shame that History Channel canceled this incredible series. I will now leave myself open to haters with my next comment. To all the skeptics out there Bigfoot and or Sasquatch IS real. Always remember it is so easy to simply deify the existence of anything and everything. It takes no work and elicits zero backlash from the public at large. However having the courage to take a stand and not only believe that something is out there, but to study and research it takes true courage.",1482364800,,594,4.776699029126213

8309419,4,B001HRJG5A,"I really enjoyed watching Monsterquest when it was on History channel.  I've been meaning to buy the DVDs for awhile now, so finally got around to purchasing season two.  It seemed like the best value for the money (since #3 is not complete and #1 is too expensive--I don't need that fancy packaging/box).  Too bad they aren't all available on DVD, but I will probably buy them from Amazon Video at some point.  I just like having the physical discs.  My favorite genre is crypto/paranormal so I am little by little expanding my collection.  Yes the narrative is a bit dry, but I appreciate how they try to be scientific about the subjects rather than go for sensationalism as so many others do.  They have brought up some valid scientific points, especially in regards to the lake and ocean 'monsters'.  The natural world is adaptable and changeable, and the waters are deep and mostly unexplored.",1468972800,,898,4.748387096774193
