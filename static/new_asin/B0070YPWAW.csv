5046416,5,B0070YPWAW,"You don't have to be a Goethe scholar or a scholar of any kind to appreciate this beautful story of young love.  Apparently it is based on a true event in Goethe's life which gives it some historical value.  But even if it were fiction or we never heard of the later-life of the great German poet this film would still be worth watching.

It is simply told, lovingly photographed and what really makes it great is the terrific performance of Alexander Fehlig as Goethe.  He is a true romantic hero, looks like he would be at home dressed in armor, riding a white steed.  Tall, blond, handsome, bold, outragous with a sweet, sensitive poetic nature...who could resist this prince?! It's not just his physical appearance that is so attractive; his facial expressions are really wonderful. He shows all of the vulnerability of a young man in his first love.  The girl friend is not as well cast, in my opinion--I think he deserved someone better. But that made the ending a little more bearable.

Don't be put off by the title.  This is as fun and juicy as any idiotic American romantic comedy.  I recommend it with enthusiasm.",1343001600,,1124,4.608040201005025

5046419,4,B0070YPWAW,"I love Goethe (with an oe). I didn't know if I'd like this film since I, like other Goethephiles, have my ""concept"" of this man. I was very happily surprised by the light-hearted sweetness of the characterization of Goethe at age 23. As a writer I deeply appreciated the strategy used by the filmmakers in showing Goethe's way of contending with hopeless love, his broken heart. I liked the lines put into Lotte's mouth; I liked the way the piece was filmed and the characterization of the ""minor"" characters such as Lotte's and Goethe's fathers. I loved the Faust puppet show that was dimly slipped into a market scene; I loved the self-mockery and playfulness of the film and its characters. It was just a pleasure to watch. I wish someone would make a film of Goethe's last love, that which the Marienbad Elegies are written. I'm actually buying a DVD.",1337212800,16,855,4.66887417218543
5046420,4,B0070YPWAW,"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the legendary German writer and the man of all talents, from art to science and considered a genius of modern German literature who is known for his works of poetry, drama, philosophy and science.

Known for his drama ""Faust"" and the ""Marienbad Elegy"" to name a few, when it comes to romance stories, Goethe will forever be remembered for his short epistolary  and loosely autobiographical novel titled ""Die Leiden des jungen Werthers"" (The Sorrows of Young Werther), which was published back in 1774.

It was a novel that was inspired by pain of loving someone so much, but yet not being able to be with them.  Pain of losing someone and for love, a sacrifice had to be made.

Suffice to say, ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" was a hit and a novel that would propel Goethe to superstar status and even created a fad in which many young men would take their lives because some interpreted ""suicide"" as the best form of showing one's love and despair.

It was a story written by a Goethe as a young adult, while he was studying law in Leipzing.  While studying law, he met a girl and through circumstance, ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" was inspired by his love for Charlotte Buff.  A story about two people who loved each other but were unable to be together because she was arranged to marry someone else and keep the family financially supported, while the tragedy was inspired by his friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, who killed himself after the woman he had an affair with, chose her husband over him.  But also the disdain of how people who committed suicide were treated posthumously at the time (people who killed themselves were looked at with the lowest disdain).

While Goethe did use the name of Werther, the real life Goethe was not so pleased about the popularity of his novel as he learned that it also outed his real relationship with Charlotte Buff, who was already married to Johann Christian Kestner.  Also, for Goethe, he didn't like how most people knew of him only through this work despite authoring other novels and literary work and disliked how he was pigeonholed as part of the Romantic movement.

Needless to say, to this day, ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" is looked at as impressive romantic novel and a storyline that has been romanticized through other books and poetry.  And once again, the story of Goethe and his relationship has been romanticized by director/writer Philipp Stlzl (""North Face"", ""Rammstein: Lichtspielhaus"", ""Baby"") and fellow co-writers Christoph Muller and Alexander Dydyna for the 2010 film ""Goethe!"" (aka in the U.S. as ""Young Goethe in Love"").

And the film will now be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Music Box Films in April 2012.

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Young Goethe in Love"" is presented in widescreen 2:35:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround.  With this film, you can expect beautiful cinematography moments courtesy of Kolja Brandt.  The scene featuring both Goethe and Lotte together in the rain as they share their first kiss is an amazing scene and shot wonderfully.  The set and costume design captures the look and feel of the late 1700's and for the most part, I was enjoying the overall cinematography and thinking how beautiful this film would look on Blu-ray.

As for the audio, audio is clear and while there are moments of gun shots that can be heard through the surround channels and some crowd-based ambiance, ""Young Goethe in Love"" is a dialogue-driven film.  As for subtitles, subtitles are in English and are easy to read.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Young Goethe in Love"" comes with three special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

For the hopeless romantics, ""Young Goethe in Love"" is a fantastic, enchanting romantic comedy!

And while there are people who disdain dramatizations of historical individuals, especially one as notable as Johann Goethe and creating a romantic story revolved around the creation of his well-known epistolary and loosely-based autobiographical novel, it all comes down to one's appreciation for romantic films and also romantic comedy.

While ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" is a love story that captures a young man's pain and broken heart after knowing that he can't be with the woman he loves, because of her family commitment, what I enjoyed about ""Young Goethe in Love"" was how the writers were able to craft a story integrating Lotte Buff in somewhat of a more positive character for Goethe.

In the novel, the character of Werther makes the ultimate sacrifice for his love for Lotte.  In the film, loosely-based on the real life situation between Goethe and Lotte, it is Lotte who makes a sacrifice for her love towards Goethe, but it's a sacrifice that you don't see coming and leaves you with a smile on your face because although this is a romantic film, it's a romantic film where both people can not be together due to circumstances, but they make one last effort not by physical contact, but by action to show their love.

So, in many ways, the basis of Goethe's ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" is a testament to a love that can not be shared in reality, but a love that will forever live in poetry.  How romantic is that?

The performances by both Alexander Fehling and Miriam Stein were delightful and fantastic, cinematography, costume and set design were well-done and a screenplay that manages to balance the romantic drama and comedy fairly well. And enough to keep the storyline from straying into banality.

Overall, ""Young Goethe in Love"" is a film that will captivate the hopeless romantics and may turn off those who have a disdain towards dramatizations of well-known figures.  But in the end, I have to say it has been many, many years since I have been captivated by a recent romantic drama and I have to say that ""Young Goethe in Love"" is a delightful, wonderful film that will no doubt captivate the hopeless romantic within you.

Definitely recommended!",1335571200,29,6021,4.857002938295788
5046421,4,B0070YPWAW,"This German film deals with an early episode in Goethe's life, his romance with a young woman, Charloltte Buff, who became the heroine of Goethe's first novel, ""The Sufferings of Young Werther."" In the film, Goethe romances and beds down Charlotte.  In life, Goethe flirted with Charlotte,,but she was the promised bride of Kestner, who was a friend of Goethe's. Acompromise was made and Goethe ceased his attentions, and the three remained friends.  No one expects films to be faithful to reality, biographies least of all.  Yet this film succeeds wonderfully in creating the atmosphere of 18th century Germany (the affair took place in the 1770s), and the cast is lively and genuine.

5046437,4,B0070YPWAW,"I am teaching Goethe's ""Werther'"" (Die Leiden des jungen Werthers) for the upteenth time and was surprised to discover this film almost by accident. Some years ago a German film of ""Werther"" was made and its highly surealistic interpretation of Werther's psychosis was both interesting and somewhat disarming. Alas, the film when released on video did not have English subtitles, and only by means of a somewhat questionable Asian source has a rare DVD of that film *with* English subtitles appeared.

My assumption, when seeing the English title ""Young Goethe in Love"" was that this would be the telling of the very strange relationship of the student-of-law at Strassburg, Goethe, and the innkeepers daughter in the neighboring village of Sessenheim, Friederike Brion. That torrid affair, which saw Goethe riding almost daily into the countryside to be with his beloved muse (for whom he wrote some of his best early poetry) suddenly came to an abrupt end when Goethe, without so much as saying farewell, left Strassburg and Friederike for good. Why has been the subject of much speculation and discussion over the years.

But no! This is the tale of the post-Strassburg Goethe, who was compelled by his disapproving Father to take a post as a legal clerk at Wetzlar, a town not too distant from his natal Frankfurt a. M., where he was assigned to the most agreeable attorney Albert Kestner. Kestner was betrothed to Goethe's landlady's very gifted and sensitive eldest daughter Charlotte and Goethe spent many happy hours with Lotte and, I might add, Albert in social settings. Occasionally Goethe and Lotte were alone and it is perhaps at those times that Goethe fancied that Lotte might forsake Albert for him. That was not to happen. As time came for Albert and Lotte to marry, Goethe became acquainted with another legal clerk in Albert's circle, Wilhelm Jerusalem, who like Goethe had developed an infatuation for a young lady -- a soul-mate perhaps -- who was married. Upon finding that this lady would not, in the end, abandon her husband for him, Jerusalem borrowed a pistol from Kestner on the pretext of going hunting, and killed himself. Kestner was beside himself when he heard the news and Goethe, fearing he might do the same over his lost love in Lotte, shut himself off from the world for eight weeks in the summer of 1774 and when he emerged, had his two-part epistolary novel ""Werther"" in hand. The rest, as they say, is history. When he sent the literary agent Merck the manuscript and it was agreed then to publish ""Werther,"" Mercke went so far as to secure for his client a firm copyright. With that Goethe's literary career was made.

So, here then is the fiction behind the fiction of the story of ""Werther"" with a little truth liberally thrown in for good measure. No ""Shakespeare in Love"" here, but rather the ""Werther"" story -- well sort of -- with a little Goethe included for good measure. Now...what about a film with Friederike Brion von Sessenheim. Now, THAT would make a great Goethe story for sure!",1378080000,15,3034,4.853281853281853

5046442,5,B0070YPWAW,"I majored in comparative literature, and Goethe is generally considered to be on the short list of greatest authors in history, on par with Homer and Shakespeare.

Modern Germans, as I understand it, think of Goethe as the towering, grand, old man he later became. So it's funny to see Goethe as a young buck in this film.

I read the novel The Sorrows of Young Werther in school, so it was enjoyable to see the story behind it, although it's apparently a somewhat fictionalized account. But - are the creators of this film having a bit of fun with us viewers? Just as the book The Sorrows of Young Werther was a fictionalized account of Goethe's relationship with Lotte, so is this movie is a fictionalized account of how that book came to be.

I didn't occur to me but some people apparently have expected this film to be similar in style or content to Shakespeare in Love. It isn't.

This film should probably be rated R for a brief sex scene (nudity) and some strong language. Silly, as usual, that filmmakers mar their creations with this stuff for no good reason.",1370131200,4,1069,4.523316062176166
5046443,5,B0070YPWAW,"Despite the American distributor's shameless try to milk the Shakespeare in Love audience as much as possible by changing the title to the above, this film is definitely not trying to be the same movie.  Sure it has some similarities and the filmmakers were no doubt aware of this, but the tone of the film, the story itself, and the emotional power are very different from each other.  Goethe! (as was the original European title) is, sure, like Shakes in Love in that it's about a famous artist when he was young and right before he ""finds his voice"" and what causes him to find that voice is romantic heartbreak.  The major difference to me is that in Goethe's case we know this to be a fact.  If you've read The Sorrows of Young Werther or know of the story or know of Goethe's personal life, then you know what happens in this film - while they twist things here and there - is for the most part all true.  Fact relates to fiction in an odd way but it relates to in a more profound way when you know the fiction has solid ground of fact supporting it.  When you watch Goethe in Love and know of the real Goethe, there is an added tenderness and heartbreak to what you see simply because you know it all really happened.  When you watch Shakespeare in Love, we really have no clue whatsoever if what we're watching happened or not, and in fact, if you know at least a little bit about Shakespeare biography, whether you believe it was Shakespeare or someone else, then you know what happens in Shakespeare in Love most likely DID NOT happen.",1357776000,12,1545,4.381118881118881

Yes, it is about the young Goethe falling in love, but take out the name ""Goethe"" and you simply have a romantic period piece.

What was missing, is what was included in ""Shakespeare In Love"" -- the brilliance of a young Shakespeare.  This film should have showed hints at the genius potential of young Goethe.  It only shows -- at the end of the film -- that he finally had a novel published and became famous in Europe as a romantic novelist.  But that is less than 10% of what he is remembered for today (e.g. he formulated the spectrum for light).  The film does not tease us with any of his upcoming scientific genius.

In the film he is just a 23 yr old kid who falls in love, is heart broken, and writes a novel (at the end of the film) about loss of love and ensuing sorrow.

5046448,4,B0070YPWAW,"Following the success of ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Molire"" - both romantic comedies inspired by the artists' younger days - another romantic drama about a great writer arrives from Germany. It is ""Young Goethe in Love"" (original title ""Goethe!"") directed by Philipp Stlzl (""North Face""), starring likeable Alexander Fehling as a failed law student/poet/playwright who later becomes one of the world's most famous men of letters. Though the film's story is pretty formulaic and predictable, ""Young Goethe in Love"" remains entertaining throughout, thanks to the solid performances from the entire cast.

Set in 1772, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, 23-year-old, is sent by his father to a rural town of Wetzlar, where he works as a law clerk under Counselor Kestner (Moritz Bleibtreu), to become a lawyer. Fun-loving and easy-going Goethe falls in love with a local girl Lotte Buff (Miriam Stein), and she also loves him, but her father has another plan for his daughter.

Charlotte (Lotte) Buff is a real-life person, generally thought as inspiration for ""The Sorrows of Young Werther,"" but you don't have to have read the book to enjoy ""Young Goethe in Love."" Though the basic storyline resembles that of ""Shakespeare in Love,"" some nice twists are added in the second half of it. Moritz Bleibtreu (""The Baader Meinhof Complex"") gives his character depth and warmth. His nuanced performance as serious-minded Kestner takes the film a notch higher.

""Young Goethe in Love"" is a gorgeously shot romantic period piece. The film is a delight, with bitter sweet moments at times, but pleasant throughout.",1346284800,3,1596,5.202334630350195

5046450,4,B0070YPWAW,"Here's a fine, entertaining film in the spirit of Shakespeare in Love. The subject is the great German poet, writer, scientist, philosopher Goethe when he was a young, foolish, spontaneous, exuberant, smart, dreamy misfit at law school who falls in love with a woman who must take responsibility for her young siblings and crumbling family fortunes.

Excellent performances all around, especially the three principals -- Goethe, his love, and his rival. The film has fine historical settings and costumes and has a quality similar to British historical melodramas. It is in German with subtitles, and the film has a lightness of touch not often associated with German films.

There is one thing in the film I especially liked. Young Goethe's rival is the man who works hard, holds a steady job, maintains strict standards, is ready to take responsibility for an extended family, and has little head for the arts. But, unlike so many polarized romantic dramas, this rival comes across as a real human being who becomes more likeable as we learn more about him. It is less a film about good free people vs. bad oppressive people (as in Easy Rider and much of the postmodern) than it is about tensions between the constraints of life in the real world and the freedom to live from your feelings -- in this film, between law and poetry, between marriage with children and affairs without them.

The plot of the film consists of the events leading to Goethe at 23 writing his impassioned blockbuster best-selling rock-star celebrity first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, 1774 -- one of the founding documents in the German Romantic movement.",1343865600,6,1641,4.938405797101449

8507890,5,B0070YPWAW,"I purchased this DVD to accompany a reading of excerpts of the original Die Leiden des Jungen Werthers by the great Goethe in our German class. The movie is loosely based on his novel, mixing the novel with elements of his actual life. It is a tantalizing little gem of a movie that effectively brought to life not just Werther but Goethe's early genius and life. Great counterpoint to the beautiful, soaring language of the novel, and an altogether nice movie for the romantic in all of us.",1453852800,,491,4.590909090909091
