This dvd shows some elementary cirlewalking exercises then goes on to demonstrate the64 handsas 8lines of 8 with instruction . the master then shows some applications in semi freestyle fashion. Then he goes through the whole form again. If you are familiar with the other 64 linear forms (eg LIU Dekan or Liang style) you will find this similar,1417651200,,356,4.852459016393443
8477264,5,B001G533Y8,"Bagua like many martial arts develops one's ability to move gracefully both in offense and defense. Watching a martial arts master like Deng Fu Ming practicing is a chance for us to see perfect synchronous movement. Sifu Deng Fu Ming calls this unity of motion.

In the first part of the video Sifu Ming demonstrates some basic circle walking emphasizing sinking the hips to improve balance and stepping techniques to move straight, at an angle or circling.

Next is a demonstration of the Linear 64 palm set. This is performed one set (8 techniques) at a time, then moving on to the next set. The emphasis throughout each of the eight sets is to show with each individual posture how the body can move quickly and precisely.

Last are some self defense moves demonstrated against an oncoming attacker striking with 1 to 4 strikes. Sifu Ming first stops the strike with exact timing and explains some ways to block the first strike in a way which prevents the follow up strikes from getting through your defenses. Some examples he demonstrates are crossing arms, flapping arm, rolling hands. I know this reads funny. However when you see Sifu Ming successfully use these to stop a fast series of attacks then you understand why Bagua can stand toe to toe with a faster attacker and still win.

Bagua Zhang is normally expressed as Eight diagram boxing.  However, if we take it down to a more basic level, we are left with a trigram. This trigram may be used to represent stationary, circular and linear fighting techniques. This video has some practice methods to develop all three.
