The pyrotechnics and the fast cuts really showcase the intensity that Rammstein brings to the crowd. I really, really dig live releases and I absolutely love it when the crowd gets into it. I am a huge fan of crowd participation on live releases and this concert film definitely shows a lot of it.",1497225600,,453,4.341176470588235

8152201,5,B000JMJRPI,"From a technical point of a view, providing the songs' texts/translation/subtitles (in German only) would add to attraction of this DVD worldwide.

Contextually, it is a monumental work accomplishing talents of musicians and producers involved at all stages of memorizing German rock for generations oncoming.

Entertaining, dynamic, rocky.",1182297600,2,340,6.0625
