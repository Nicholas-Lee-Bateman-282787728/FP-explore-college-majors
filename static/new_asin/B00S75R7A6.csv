8697474,4,B00S75R7A6,"I'm going to start out with the positives.

#1  The beginning section (Pai Da) or self-hitting was great, authentic Bagua QiGong.  Sifu Scott has good shoulder and waist flexibility, and great coordination.  These 4 exercises are worth the price of this DVD.
The shoulder swings, teacups and grasping exercises are fairly well demonstrated, and should make sense to beginners.

Sifu Scott does a good job explaining the body mechanics of each exercise, and the video is high quality.

Ok, here are my critiques:
#2  It's clear that Sifu Scott is mostly into Shaolin or some Northern Chinese arts.  His teacups (unique to baguazhang) are stiff and use mostly ""hip shifting"", instead of Dai Mai (belt channel).
The grasping exercises are very stiff, and the ""dantian rotation"" and ""segmented power"" of Baguazhang are just not visible in this video (not saying he doesn't have it)

I think this DVD is great for Amazon.  It's probably a 5 star video to anyone who hasn't trained Bagua for years.

These Body conditioning drills are life changing. Sifu Jensen's deep knowledge of anatomy, physiology and Chinese Medicine brings these ancient techniques alive for those of us needing deep healing and rejuvenation.  I came to Sifu Jensen with severe symptoms from ""Thorasic Outlet Syndrome"" (advanced Carpel Tunnel).  I had limited mobility, numbness in my hands, arms, fingers and severe pain & swelling throughout my shoulders and neck. Over time and with practice I was able to heal all these issues with these conditioning drills.  I now have no pain, no numbness, minimal restrictions and as long as I continue to  practice I have continued improvements. Sifu Jensen's teaching skills and his extensive knowledge of the body will show you the way to heal old injuries and prevent future ones! This method does healing on a number of levels... anyone can benefit from these deep and powerful exercises that have profound results!  Well worth the time and effort to learn. This is deep healing and I was unprepared  as this level of profound change is beyond what I ever expected! My neurologist had predicted the only thing I could look forward to was pain control!  So even if you have a severe injury don't give up as these tools provide amazing shifts that begin to heal and improve all the body but especially for injuries to shoulders, neck, hands and arms. I was lucky to find Sifu Jensen as his patience and guidance allowed me to heal slowly each area I had damaged.  I hope this introduction into this powerful tool brings you this opportunity to heal or build a strong body.... Student since 1998, JT",1466467200,3,1641,4.898916967509026
8697476,5,B00S75R7A6,Bagua is perhaps the most beautiful and complex martial art requiring intense focus and incredible fitness.  Do these exercises with regularity for a long (life) time and you won't believe the positive effects it will have on your body and mind.  This DVD is very well produced and designed with the student in mind.,1459468800,,316,4.833333333333333
8697477,5,B00S75R7A6,"Simple on the surface, yet profound underneath. These drills develop great internal strength. Also they have been great for my shoulders, loosening and connecting muscles properly. Every time I practice these drills I notice a tangible change to the condition of my body. I always feel stronger yet more relaxed and greater range of motion.",1458518400,3,340,5.2
