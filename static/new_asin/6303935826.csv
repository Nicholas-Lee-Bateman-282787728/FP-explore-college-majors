732110,3,6303935826,"I didn't like this as well as some stuff I have seen.  Can't say why for sure, maybe I wished there was more about Trigger.",1361145600,,123,3.92
732111,5,6303935826,I became curious about Roy Rogers and Dale Evans after watching a couple of their movies and wanted to know more about his life and who he was.  The Biography was informative and I would recommend to anyone who would want to know the life of Roy Rogers and his family.  He truly was a kind man with a big heart and a strong sense for truth and justice.,1360454400,,352,4.086956521739131
732112,5,6303935826,"Good movie.  The world needs many, many more people like Roy, not these so called stars of today.  Roy was a man worthy to be looked up to.  Never a breath of scandle about him.  A good example for anyone.",1358121600,,205,4.05
732113,3,6303935826,"I guess the fact that I've read ""The Answer is God"" and ""Angel Unaware"" made me much more aware already of what the lives of Roy and Dale had been like so, to me, this seemed like it just didn't say a lot. But, it was enjoyable and it's nice to have pictures of the family and film of Roy riding Trigger. I'll certainly keep it and look at it from time to time. If anyone is really interested in their story, get the books mentioned above.",1354406400,,439,4.057471264367816
732114,5,6303935826,King Of The Cowboys & Roy is just that. Watching him when my Dad would take us to the theater in a diapers & now turning 73 years old & still watching & most of all enjoying Roy getting the bad guys that are hurting our America. My Dad is gone now like Roy but he enjoyed watching Roy to the end. Yes An American Legend Roy is & will always be & this video will always be enjoyed along with all his movies,1292284800,2,405,3.8333333333333335
732115,4,6303935826,"I've always loved Roy Rogers and by extension Dale Evans, their radio shows, films, recordings, comics, etc. This is no exception. I don't think I learned anything new here, but I certainly enjoyed watching this DVD.",1255824000,2,216,5.027777777777778
732116,5,6303935826,"In this day of trash celebrities, what a wonderful biography of truly wonderful, good, caring people. This DVD is well worth an hour of anyones time, western fan or not. This and the Bill ""Hopalong Cassidy"" Boyd biography give a glimpse of a world long gone.",1247356800,5,258,4.630434782608695
732117,5,6303935826,What a great story!  I grew up with Roy & Dale and this bio of Roy shows what a wonderful person he was!  And what a great couple!,1211846400,2,130,3.607142857142857
732118,5,6303935826,"If you want to know the Real Roy Rogers and not just the ""King of the Cowboys"" from the Silver Screen, then this is a MUST for your video library.  I had the honor of meeting both Roy and Dale at the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City and they were two of the most genuine people and just as wholesome as they played on the screen.  If you love the Singin' Cowboy and love Roy and Dale then you have to see this wonderful bio.

7855765,5,6303935826,"I grew up watching the ""Roy Rogers Show"" as a kid, he was and still is the ""King of the Cowboys"" to me. I enjoyed watching this DVD to include his movies. A real American Legend and hero during my childhood years. Great DVD on the life of Roy Rogers.",1448409600,,250,4.02

7855768,5,6303935826,I had the privilege to meet Mr. Rogers when I was 7 years old in 1956. He taught me what class really is. My father brought me to Madison Square Garden to see the rodeo. He knew the stage manager and took me into the rear of the Garden where Mr. Rogers dressing room was. He was not supposed to be bothered and I could see he was understandingly annoyed. The Stage Manager told him about my having polio (I wore a brace for 12 years). Roy immediately came over to me and put his arm around me. Took a picture (which I still have). If you watch this you will find out that Roy was quite a man. We need more like Roy today.,1404518400,,621,3.976
7855769,5,6303935826,Roy Rogers and Trigger were a part of history and good memories and good times for quite a few generations. A lot could be learnt today from Roy and the messages he tried to convey in life and his work.,1393459200,,202,4.075
7855770,5,6303935826,I bought it for my dad for Fathers Day and I think he has watched it five times since. He said he learned a few things he didn't know about his childhood hero. That's good in my book. Happy dad liked it.,1377475200,,203,3.857142857142857
7855771,5,6303935826,I have been a Roy Rogers fan since I was a little girl.  Love Trigger! My husband and a thoroughly enjoyed the biography of Roy and Dale.  If you like the old westerns you will enjoy this one.,1368835200,,192,4.026315789473684
7855772,5,6303935826,I have loved Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as long as I can remember.  I grew up watching them on TV.  I read Angel Unaware when I was about 7 years old and never forgot it.  It made a huge impact on me.  The trials Roy and Dale went through in their lives and the face that they never lost their faith has moved me and helped me to come to  grips with my own spirituality.  Roy and Dale both were very special people and I highly suggest reading anything and everything you can get your hands on about these wonderful people.,1368576000,,522,4.068627450980392
7855773,3,6303935826,"Roy and Trigger,Was always my cowboy,As a boy I lived and dreamed about them,Running around with my cap guns strapped to my waste and driving every one crazy. So I was a little disappointed when the DVD only ran for 50 minuets,",1366934400,,227,4.428571428571429
