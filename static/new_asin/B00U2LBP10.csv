7027522,2,B00U2LBP10,"As an NYCB subscriber, I wanted to love this film. But after an hour of preamble and empty, vacuous shots that don't advance the story (the choreographer waiting for the subway, a long shot of him walking down his apartment hallway), WE DON'T GET TO SEE THE BALLET HE CREATES. We do see snippets, but during the performance, the camera is trained on him, sitting in the audience. How can you do a documentary about the creation of a ballet and not show the finished product?

I am giving this two stars because I enjoyed seeing Sterling Hyltin and Tiler Peck, two true artists, at work. But otherwise, this documentary disappoints.",1433030400,35,631,4.684684684684685
7027523,2,B00U2LBP10,"I am crazy for ballet, especially NYCB.  This film was frequently boring with overlong shots on individuals doing nothing.  Ballet is bursting with creative energy and performance.  This film was slow and flat.  Sorry, I really wanted to love it.",1432944000,8,246,5.075
7027524,4,B00U2LBP10,"Ballet 422 is a terrific documentary about the creation of a ballet  in this case, the 422nd ballet produced by the New York City Ballet. Focus of the film is 25-year-old Justin Peck, a New York City Ballet soloist and resident choreographer. The movie begins with a few facts about New York City Ballet, but moves quickly to the excellent behind-the-scenes footage of how Peck and his dancers put together a brand new ballet  the only premiere of the Winter, 2013 season.

It is simply amazing that the entire, finished ballet is not shown. This should definitely have been the closing sequence, illustrating how so much hard work can result in a beautiful creation. My guess is that New York City Ballet wanted to keep the ballet, Paz de la Jolla, an exclusive for in-person performances and didn't give permission for the entire ballet to be shown. What a shame. Because New York City Ballet is one of the most famous companies in the nation, there is a star aura around the company, which will attract ballet fans. I cant see how the documentary will intrigue those who aren't into ballet, but for those who are, the film will provide fascinating background. The coordination of all elements  music, choreography, costumes, lighting, etc.  in a mere two months appears an impossible task, but speaks to the professionalism of all concerned.

Bonus features include commentary with director Jody Lee Lipes and Justin Peck; deleted scenes; choreography sketches gallery; costume design gallery; and a making-of featurette.",1432598400,5,1524,5.003952569169961
7027525,4,B00U2LBP10,"""Ballet 422"" (2014 release; 75 min.) is a documentary about how New York City Ballet dancer Justin Peck, all of just 25 yrs. old, is commissioned to choreograph a new ballet piece, and he has only 2 months to do it, with the premiere scheduled for January 31, 2013 (it is the only new ballet piece of the Winter '13 season, and it is the ballet's 422th overall). The documentary opens with a couple of facts regarding the City Ballet itself (such as: it has its own full tie orchestra), and then we dive straight in, and we are treated to a no-holds barred behind the scenes look at how Peck goes about it.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, if you don't care for ballet, please save yourself te trouble and check out another movie instead. On the other hand, if you love ballet, chances are that you will marvel as we get a glimpse of how the City ballet actually works on a day-to-day basis. We get to know Justin Peck a little bit, as well as several of the featured dancers including Tiler Peck (no relation) and Sterling Hyltin. If you are expecting high drama (say as in ""Black Swan""), you will be sorely disappointed. Instead, we get to appreciate the hard work that goes into a ballet piece, all the way to the smallest details (it is amazing to see how much attention the costume design is given). Couple of surprises for me from the documentary: at no point does Justin Peck share explain his vision or concept for he new ballet piece, or if he did, it didn't make it in the documentary. Also, while we are told that the music being used for the ballet hails from 1935, we don't find out what composer or which music piece until the movie's end credits, wow. But in the end those are minor quibbles, and I enjoyed ""Ballet 422"" quite a bit.

I saw ""Ballet 422"" at a recent one-time only special showing at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. It was announced beforehand that following the showing there would be a Q&A with Victoria Morgan, Creative Director and CEO of the Cincinnati Ballet. It was great that the theater was absolutely PACKED for this, and indeed there was a lively discussion after the showing, with Victoria sharing her further insights on all this. If you love ballet, I strongly encourage you to check out ""Ballet 422"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray (where hopefully there will be some bonus materials). ""Ballet 422"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1431216000,11,2433,4.552511415525114
7027526,1,B00U2LBP10,"Extremely disappointing. Considering that we're not allowed to see the finished ballet in full - the creation of which is the subject of this film! - and that this work is familiar only to regular attendees of NYCB in New York, it is dreadfully boring, even to balletomanes. Maybe if it would have followed NYCB dancers preparing for a beautiful familiar work with tutus and other luxurious trappings (such as Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake or Symphony in C) it would have been worth the view.",1428796800,6,489,4.764705882352941
7027527,4,B00U2LBP10,"I really enjoyed this.  There are no ""talking heads"" or interviews, but it is certainly not a silent film.  The dialogue between choreographer, dancers, musicians, and supporting staff depict a real life saga of pulling together a new ballet in a short period of time.  The totally different personalities of the three main dancers is eye-opening and entertaining.  This documentary is shown from a ""fly-on-the-wall"" perspective and brings the viewer right there.  I hope to see the resulting ballet some day !!!",1428537600,8,512,5.195121951219512

7027531,1,B00U2LBP10,"In my opinion, it was truly disappointing. I did enjoy seeing those bits of dancing, but there was definitely not enough. There was too much camera time on the choreographer, and almost none on the dancers which are the main part. I was also disappointed to not be able to see the finished product at the end. That's what I waited for, and didn't get it.",1454457600,,354,4.378787878787879
7027532,1,B00U2LBP10,"Wow - I can't believe someone wants money for this - it was free (well technically not free but it was on Netflix) so I watched it. I'd give Justin Peck 5 stars as he seems very talented; however the documentary itself, I must agree with most of the reviews, was terrible and had absurdly long shots of the Justin Peck staring at incredibly talented dancers. I thought ""eh, I could put up with this absurdity if in the end they will actually show the final product or show us more of the talented dancing"". I was wrong, the final product is only seen as a blur of moving dancers as the camera focused on the back of Justin Peck's head as he watched the final product. I can't wrap my head around the point of watching the back of Justin Peck's head for what seemed like an eternity while something incredible was happening in the background. I understand the point of the documentary is to watch the behind the scenes efforts that go into NYC ballet...but, this was incredibly boring to watch.",1453593600,,993,4.4316939890710385

7027534,1,B00U2LBP10,"What little I gleaned from this movie:
Justin communicates his concept and choreography to the dancers telepathically.
Poor Justin lives in a world of silence where he rarely speaks, never gets a phone call, has no friends or family.
Justin's creative process is mostly about staring into space.
Really?  There needs to be more context here.  In the end, the film felt empty.",1446768000,2,375,4.936507936507937

7027536,5,B00U2LBP10,"Gorgeously filmed.  No extraneous narration, the pictures are allowed to tell the story.  The only thing missing is a slightly more expressive and, yes, interesting central character.  Justin Peck is a cipher -- either that or a very bland, inexpressive young man.  It would have been more fun to have a more passionate, expressive, verbally facile choreographer at the center.  As it is, the choreographic process -- why Peck chose particular dancers, for instance, why he made any choices at all -- becomes quite opaque.  This movie would have been even cooler with, say, a young Mark Morris or Edward Villella at the center.  That said, I love the way it was filmed.  Three -- no four, no five! -- cheers for a director who doesn't break dancing up into fragments with with quick cuts and ""artistic"" angles featuring tortured faces and grasping hands.  This director pulls the camera back so we can see full length bodies and then he lets the dancing and the choreography be the star.",1444176000,,987,4.792899408284024
7027537,4,B00U2LBP10,"Although I enjoy the ballet, I lack the technical language to describe what is distinctive about the ballet we see bloom throughout this documentary  choreographed by Justin Peck and principally danced by Tiler Peck, Sterling Hyltin and Amar Ramasar  but that to me is the least interesting part of this film. It's the voyeuristic eye into not only Peck's creative process, but also the creative process of the musicians, dancers, lighting techs, costume designers, etc., that makes this documentary worth watching.

With each passing week, Peck becomes a little bit paler and a little more worried. It's easy to forget until the last 10 minutes of the film that while he was choreographing an entirely new ballet, he was still a corps member of the New York City Ballet. There were a few too many lingering shots of Peck at a train station or in silhouette as he watched his ballet unfold on stage. Far better to extend the narrative of how people operate creatively outside of the studio, e.g., when we see Peck in his apartment reviewing video footage, an upright piano next to his computer desk and art adorning many surfaces.

There's civility brimming with tension as these creatives work together.  Pressure weighs on everyone and it's fascinating to glimpse the professional contortionism people will go through to offer a polite correction or avoid making a decision.

Recommended for anyone interested in the creative process, particularly where it involves multiple people from different disciplines coming together.",1442102400,,1527,5.137096774193548
7027538,5,B00U2LBP10,"Expectations were exceeded for some and unmet for others. I thought BALLET 422 was excellent as a journey with Justin Peck. Ideas unfolded. as he saw pieces and parts take shape. This in itself was amazing as we come to realize that choreography, dancers, music, movement touch, interact, relate, change, flow and a evolve.
The dancers as soloists and within a partnership in pas de deux. We are not seeing the finished product, but grace, skill, experience, energy, and toil like atoms come together, touch, move apart.
BALLET 422 is not a drama. It is not scripted as such. Perhaps the ballet as a whole will, one day, be filmed and packaged in its entirety and this will be a vastly different experience. This is a documentary intended to reveal the process of making dance, not ballet as a finished product.
As a collaborative effort, it is brilliant in the way lighting specialists, costume designers, orchestra and conductor work on and work with the dancers, and the choreographer. We see color in concept and color expressed in bursts of light, and in the detail of each costume, their form and texture expressed in multiple ways for principals and corps de ballet - artists all.
And yes, we see Justin Peck going home at the end of a day, a desolate train station. His Park Avenue is worn and shabby. His hallway, grey and colorless. He is young and vulnerable and far from the splendor that is Lincoln Center and the wealth of Park in the 70's and 80's. Peck searches with and connect with many, but is ultimately alone in this creative venture. If the ballet fails, it will be Peck's failure. His alone.",1440633600,,1614,4.686619718309859

In fact I could not remember what the piece sounded like, and this movie did nothing to awaken memories of it. Other than this, it is a fine look into what goes into the making of a ballet with one of the most talented choreographers of his generation and the lovely place that I call work ""home""",1437782400,,527,4.176470588235294

In other words, although retired, she loves ballet and knows her stuff.  This documentary focused (in our opinion) too much on Justin Peck's back walking down halls or close ups of him watching rehearsal.  There was little spark nor drama.  The creative process and dealing with dancers' personalities and quirks surely is not this plodding.  Beautiful dancers though and many kudos to this young choreographer!  We wished we could have seen more of the actual performance.  It was hard to tell what was going on in his mind other then ""pensive"" and perhaps ""worried"".

I could appreciate the heritage from Robbins and Balanchine that this company has got.  And I just observed what every member of the company who was shown, was the continuation of such geniuses. Their professionalism, respect, beauty, blind devotion, commitment come from them.  There will never be a Balanchine again, so the NYCB is doing exactly what it should:  to encourage young choreographers to do their best, and maybe they'll do at least one ballet that compares to a Balanchine masterpiece.  HIS ESSENCE is everywhere in the NYCB as well as at his theatre, his temple.
This is a film to be felt more that analyzed.  At the end, when the music of Symphony in C is playing and Lincoln Center appears, some tears came out by remembering all the history of this unique company.",1473033600,,1029,4.720670391061453

8703985,2,B00U2LBP10,"Overall, I was disappointed and even surprised.  There were a few big problems with this documentary.  First, the camera work is puzzling; important things like a ballerina dancing the choreography was cut out of the frame in favor of a shot of the choreographer watching her.  Second, we get no real introduction to the dancers that we do see (it's simply mentioned that some are corps de ballet and other are principals).  Third, it's hard to figure out just what the documentary-maker wanted the viewer to learn from this film.  There's shots of the choreographer looking at his computer or out into the audience when we need to be seeing - and learning - much more about the dancers who bring his work to life.  The title of the film is Ballet 422 and dancers are as much a part of a ballet as the choreography.

There was a significant - and somewhat odd - emphasis on the development of the costumes.  Yes, costumes are part of a ballet but in this case they were simple and did not contribute a lot to the finished product.  Why did this documentary spend so much time featuring the costume designers?

For a much more engaging and detailed look into the making of a ballet, watch the CBC's ""Romeos and Juliets"" online.  It's fascinating, comprehensive and everything Ballet 422 isn't.

I found only one dancer interview in the 'Extras' section.  The viewer naturally wants to know who they are watching and unless you google afterward - without, in many cases, even knowing the dancers' names - you can't find out.",1458259200,,1522,4.655430711610487
8703986,3,B00U2LBP10,"In this documentary style film, we meet, Justin Peck, a dancer in the Corps de Ballet of the famed NYC Ballet but also a rising star as a choreographer. In 2013, Peck is tapped to choreograph the season's only brand new ballet--Ballet 422.

What's wonderful about this film is seeing the 'behind the scenes' aspects of how a ballet piece is created and then executed, as well as all the moving parts that come with it--from costume, orchestra, the dancers learning the routine and lighting.

What's not so wonderful is pretty much everything else. First, this is not a typical documentary where we get a narrator who helps shape the narrative/voice of the film and keep it streamlined and focused. You are literally a ghost that follows Justine Peck around and it's a very choppy journey at that. There are no interviews by the participants to give us context, explanations, a sense of the emotion, passion or excitement at all. For all the energy that everyone *likely* has, I get zero exuberance of the process and none of the joys that I *know* they have but everything is so mellow and muted as to get quite sleepy in parts. What makes it more detached for me was that no one is identified as to who they are and their role within the company. You just sorta get told or gain a vague idea as you watch along and are supposed to glean the intangibles (people's thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc) by merely observing body language and the minimal discussions between the 'actors'...

If you are looking for a biographical sketch on Peck, a history of the NYC Ballet or the process of choreography itself, Ballet 422 is not for you. It lacks a clear direction beyond showing bits and pieces of how a dance is put together. I needed more to really care.

The special features are worth watching and it livens up entirety of the film a little more but it's a little to late. The commentary by the director and Peck did provide some much needed context that should have been in the actual film itself. While an interesting insight into Peck's process, without there being an sense of a timeline, more depth about showing us the process about Peck himself and his journey (and not just vignettes of rehearsal)...it was difficult to really get excited about any scene or anyone in this film.",1456704000,,2287,4.639506172839506
