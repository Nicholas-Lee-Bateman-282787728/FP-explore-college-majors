I have loads of better (though I like this film) that cost less and had neat features with them.  I am beginning to wonder if Shout overappreciates their value to we collectors.  (re: collectors: although not all items purchased were  DVDs,  I have ordered over 3K$ of items from Amazon of which the large majority were DVDs or BluRays and one Laserdisc - Forbidden Planet - and my collection is several thousand - not including VHS/Beta and Laserdisc.
Oh, I used to teach television/media production and threw in a load of film and tv history - emphasizing Black and Hispanic materials based on my students needs/interests and backgrounds.((  Update: IFF this is our region(US) and is an our region issue of the British BR with it's features, great!!!

I was really excited to upgrade from the mediocre DVD to a blu-ray copy, so when this Steelbook for it was announced it was an instant pre-order.  It comes with two discs, the blu-ray that has the movie and some commentaries and a featurette.  And a DVD that has a bunch more special features.
Compared to the old DVD this is definitely a better viewing experience, some parts of the movie look better than others, but overall this is probably the best this movie will look for a long time.  Overall I completely recommend this movie, it's just a lighter fun sci-fi film and this is a great Steelbook release for it.",1526428800,,721,4.523076923076923

I looked forward to having it in Blu Ray and bought this version. If you are new to this movie, you will not see it in the Blu Ray version as the same movie that die hard fans know and have appreciated it. The video and sound have now been edited to actually remove little things that gave BB its charm. I will give two examples. First, in the original movie you can actually see the hole in the wall when they pull Dr. Emilio Lizardo from it. A couple of frames now edited out leaves you unable to see this original editing error. Second. when BB and Perfect Tommy go into the jail to meet with Penny the other female inmates are talking to Perfect Tommy. The Blu Ray version has the audio of the other inmates edited from it and there is only silence. These may seem like little things, but these changes make the movie more serious and you lose the fact that taking BB seriously is the humor of the movie.

7749130,5,B01F6EHOFS,"A MESSAGE FROM EARL MAC RAUCH AND W.D. RICHTER
As fans of Dr. Buckaroo Banzais adventures, some of you may have heard rumors or read in the latest issue of the Banzai Institutes World Watch One Newsletter (10/16) that we are engaged in an ongoing battle with MGM regarding the ownership of rights to both THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8TH DIMENSION and to the entire Buckaroo universe that Earl Mac Rauch began creating a full decade before the actual movie.
On the other hand, all this may come as news to you.  Many of you perhaps are not aware that any unresolved Buckaroo rights issues actually exist because you have quite reasonably assumed for years that MGM owned Buckaroo Banzai lock, stock, and barrel.  Others of you, even after having read about the current rights brouhaha on many different blogs, may still be confused about the exact nature of our dispute.  And, of course, some of you may just wish the whole problem would go away so that more Buckaroo Banzai adventures might appear. If you're in the last category, ask yourselves, What would Buckaroo do if something he felt rightly belonged to one person was being taken away by another?
A little history is probably in order.  Come with us in the time machine back to  March 25, 1981, when the producer Sydney Beckerman received from W.D. Richter and Neil Canton a bound volume they called A Buckaroo Banzai Sampler consisting of extracts from no fewer than five separate Buckaroo Banzai adventures.  Beckerman read the Buckaroo Sampler and the next day took Canton and Richter into MGM to give studio chief David Begelman a detailed presentation of Rauchs wholly original, multi-episode saga.  They left behind a copy of A Buckaroo Banzai Sampler for Begelmans perusal.
One day later, on Friday afternoon, March 27, 1981, Begelman told Beckerman that he had taken a shine to one episode in particular, LEPERS FROM SATURN  A BUCKAROO BANZAI ADVENTURE.  It had been presented to him as a 57-page treatment in which Buckaroo squared off against grotesque aliens from another planet who were moving amongst us disguised as Earthlings!  MGM wanted to hire Mac to turn that into a screenplay.  It was crystal clear Begelman was not proposing that Mac base his MGM script upon all the separate episodes presented to the studio in A Buckaroo Banzai Samplerin much the same way that one would never propose that a script for The Hound of the Baskervilles be based upon The Complete Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.  All of this is highly significant and, as lawyers say, foundational.
A problem arises (the root of the dispute) in that nowhere does MGM define in the contract exactly what underlying material was to be the source of Macs work.  He was definitely not hired to write an Original Screenplay because the MGM contract specifically engaged him only to write a script based on what it called the Property, which the studio itself defined as an original story idea by Writeran idea, as we know, that came to them in the form of an underlying treatment they never owned because its acquisition was never even mentioned in the contract.  Instead, all of Macs fees were linked directly to his work only on the script itself!
Meanwhile, in 1981, while Mac was writing the first draft of his screenplay, a flurry of real-life events changed the landscape.  MGM purchased United Artists and merged the two companies.  On July 13, 1982, while Mac was doing revisions on his first draft, David Begelman was removed as chief of MGM/UA.  The new administration was wholeheartedly unenthusiastic about BUCKAROO BANZAI and agreed to sign the project over to Begelman's freshly minted independent company, the bankruptcy-plagued outfit known as Sherwood Productions which Begelman would leverage into a complex and chaotic series of mortgages, assignments, and a host of other dubious financial manipulations involving unwitting entities like European American Bank and Trust Company, Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, Time Warner Entertainment Company LP, August Entertainment, Inc., the Kushner-Locke Company, and many, many more.  These bizarre, conflicting and overlapping entanglements hollowed out and threw into great confusion the ownership rights to THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8TH DIMENSION and eventually resulted in the bankruptcy of both Sherwood Productions and Gladden Entertainment (a company Mr. Begelman formed after the collapse of Sherwood Productions).  A despondent David Begelman committed suicide on August 7, 1995, in Los Angeles.
So as years turned into decades, the rights to Buckaroo twisted and turned, jumping from company to company, from bank to bank, disappearing entirely at times and then reappearing first in one studios library and then inexplicably in anothers, leaving a paper trail no legal bloodhound could hope to follow.  In short, from the moment Begelman lost control of the title, it became, from month to month, anybodys guess who might or might not have possessed documentation proving their exclusive ownership of THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8TH DIMENSION.
By 1998, yet another MGM administration had reentered the picture, having ironically acquired a bulk library of films from Seagrams Universal that happened to contain a movie David Begelman set in motion seventeen years earlier: THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8TH DIMENSION.  But in 1998, the new MGM team agreed with Begelmans immediate 1982 successors and considered Buckaroo a moribund brand of little worth to the studio.  Understandably then, they saw no reason to waste time and resources investigating the spotty rights documentation that accompanied such an apparent loser.
We did take the time, however, hiring at our own expense a nationally respected firm to research ownership of the film, something like a mortgage company doing a title search to authenticate ownership of real estate. Thomson & Thomsons 1999 report made it clear that there were significant gaps in the Buckaroo chain of title  the same reality that Warner Brothers confronted ten years later.  Why would Warners even figure in this controversy?  Because in 2009 Warner Brothers, in a potential partnership with MGM, approached us to create an animated television series, based on a concept they dubbed THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI.  When we expressed enthusiasm, their legal team did a thorough search of the chain of title and found too many gaps to proceed with the project.  As indicated by the following pair of emails Warner Bros. sent to our representatives, that studio was saying MGM could not, to Warners satisfaction, prove ownership of the title:
WB EMAILS RE: BB TITLE CHAIN
From: Adams, Ed  Sent: Friday, October 30, 2009 7:51 PM  To: Jeff Field; Ryan Nord  Subject: Buckaroo Banzai
Jeff and Ryan  I apologize for our inability to connect by phone this week.  As I previously mentioned, I passed all of the documents you sent along to our rights department.  After their review and analysis, they found two major gaps in the chain of title (and perhaps some minor ones, as well).  1. There is a gap between Credit Lyonnaise and Universal/Polygram.  2. There is a gap between Polygram and Richter/Rauch. The rights department is doing further research in an attempt to close these gaps. That means we're willing to do the legwork (and bear the cost) to try and figure this out.  I am hoping that will be received as good news.  For now, WB will foot the bill and see what we can find out.  The bad news is that this means additional time while we try to satisfy ourselves that the rights are available.  I am not sure how long to expect, but we should probably touch base in about a week.  That is all I have to report for now.  Clearing the chain of title remains the number one issue for us, but hopefully we are moving in a positive direction.  If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.  Otherwise, let's try to touch base in a week or so.
Best, Ed

March 05, 2010 From: Adams, Ed  Sent: Friday, March 05, 2010 8:11 PM  To: Jeff Field; Ryan Nord (Business Fax) Cc: Register, Sam  Subject: Buckaroo Banzai - Chain of Title
Jeff and Ryan  At long last, I am pleased to get back to you with a response regarding the chain of title.  I am sorry it took so long, but the rights department has been busy with a number of priorities for other divisions.  As we have discussed a number of times, Warner Bros. would require a clean chain-of-title in order to option and move forward with development of an animated project based upon ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across The 8th Dimension."" Unfortunately, because of a number of transfers of the rights in the property, there are gaps in the chain.  These gaps need to be closed before we can proceed any further.  1. Agreement between MGM and Sherwood.  2. Mortgage of Copyright from Sherwood to Lyonnais.  3. Foreclosure on the mortgage by Credit Lyonnais showing its succession to the rights.  4. December 1995 assignment from Lyonnais to Alpha.  5. November 1998 assignment from Alpha to Polygram.  There may be additional open questions, but these are the most pressing.  My rights team has done as much as it can at this point.  After you have had a chance to review the above with your clients, we should set up a time to discuss next steps.  I apologize that I am not delivering better news, but I can assure you the rights team worked very hard to create the best outcome they could.  I look forward to speaking with you both soon. Ed
Meanwhile, Macs contract sat there asserting that no matter who might actually be able to prove ownership of the movie, he, Earl Mac Rauch, still owned the rights both to his treatment for LEPERS FROM SATURN and to the world of Buckaroo Banzai.  And what has been MGMs response to Macs assertion of those rights?  Your claim is baseless.  MGM owns all the rights to Buckaroo Banzai.  Their lawyers, however, have never pointed out any language in the contract that supports such a grandiose claim.  Nor have they pointed to any language that refutes our claim that they failed to acquire even the underlying material upon which the movie was based.  In fact, in the several written studio responses to our letters asking for a detailed rebuttal to our claim, MGM has merely resorted to rephrasing, without elaboration, that same defense: Your claim is baseless.  MGM owns all the rights to Buckaroo Banzai.
You might well ask why we have chosen to bring all this to the fore now. For over thirty years weve sat back and watched the ostensible ownership rights to THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8TH DIMENSION bounce around the entertainment and financial industries, unloved in libraries thick with more commercially successful films.  But now, suddenly, with the release of Shout Videos special Bluray edition of the movie, interest in the potential of the Buckaroo brand has shot up, and MGM would seem to be working with Amazon Pictures to create a Buckaroo Banzai TV series.  But they have no interest in involving Buckaroos original creators.  This prompted us to pull out Macs foundational 1981 MGM contract to see what his rights actually were and if he might, at the very least, be due some sort of royalty payment should the series become a reality.  We both now read contracts with far more sophisticated eyes than we did in 1981, and something popped out at us. We hired a top-notch intellectual property lawyer to read Macs contract to determine if we were misunderstanding what it actually said.  We werent, he told us.  Then he looked at the title search and read Warner Brothers assessment that the chain of title was plagued by numerous gaps.  He wrote a letter to MGM asserting Macs rights.
And now, Watson, the game is afoot.  We suspect theres more than enough here for you to digest, and this is not intended to be a complete statement of our legal position.  It is simply a letter to our friends, one that we hope will make clear what the rights issues you have or soon may hear about really are.  Well update you in the near future, as warranted by new events in what Buckaroo would surely call a developing situation.

My favorite on this disc tho is the new multi-part making off documentary.

7749184,5,B01F6EHOFS,"What's this? No, it's not your hand Buckaroo. It's a Blu-ray of Buckaroo! Just when you thought the universe was safe, invaders from another dimension are coming to take over our world! ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" remains a loopy film with a plot that seems to run in random circles but it's a fun jog.

Shout! Supreme a special new label for cult films like ""Buckaroo"" gives the deluxe treatment that this film deserves in high def (as to whether or not we will see this in UHD, well, that remains to be seen).

""Buckaroo"" isn't a perfect film but it's fun nevertheless. Director W. D. Richter has some issues with tone and pacing with the film but, given that ""Buckaroo"" was constantly undergoing ""evolution"" even while in production (notes from the studio, etc.) , that's hardly a surprise.

The transfer looks extremely nice using a new 2K transfer for the film. The new extra here is a documentary on the history of the film on the main disc with the film. It features new interviews from the key players.

Michael and Denise Okuda provide a brand new commentary track--both worked on the film prior to their association with the Star Trek franchise. ""Into the 8th Dimension"" the new doc is divided into--naturally--eight parts. All the main cast and production crew (including the director) participate. It's a wild and fun ride on what went into making ""Banzai"" and the difficult birth of the film from the first draft script to the production of the film. We also get the original commentary track from the DVD.

On the DVD we get the featurette ported over from the original DVD. We also get the original discarded opening with Jamie Lee Curtis, deleted scenes and trailers. There are a handful of special features that didn't make the cut for the DVD (I'm not sure if this was a licensing issue--that's most likely the case though) so, if you want everything, you may want to hold on to your MGM DVD.

This is a terrific presentation of a cult classic.

Highly recommended.",1470182400,18,1991,4.687679083094556
7749185,5,B01F6EHOFS,"Seriously- Ignore the first review. I bought this direct from Shout Factory/ Scream Factory and also received a limited edition poster which is freaking fantastic.
I do not need to get into story line. If you are here, you know what this excellent cult movie is all about.
Shout factory does an excellent job. I mean an EXCELLENT job restoring the movie and adding the extra special add ons to this edition.
If you are at all a fan of this movie and Peter Weller, get it. GET IT now before it goes OOP (out of print) and you have to spend $100 on eBay just to get this version.

8760302,5,B01F6EHOFS,"W.D. Richters The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension! tells the story of the titular polymath Dr. Buckaroo Banzai, a physicist, neurosurgeon, test pilot, and rock musician who must work to defeat inter-dimensional aliens called Red Lectroids from Planet 10. Banzai works with his assistants, the Hong Kong Cavaliers (Rawhide [Clancy Brown], Reno Nevada [Pepe Serna], Perfect Tommy [Lewis Smith], Dr. Sidney Zweibel [Jeff Goldblum], and others) against an all-star cast, including John Lithgow as Lord John Whorfin, Christopher Lloyd as John Bigboot, Vincent Schiavelli as John OConnor, and more. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Cavaliers must work to maintain control over their dimension-hopping technology as the Secretary of Defense wishes to control it for the military.

The film brilliantly alternates between science fiction, satire, and comedy in such a way as to recall the best of this type of 1980s sci-fi. At times, Richters work feels like a modern update to the classic adventure serial, as he drops the viewer into an established universe and even announced a planned, but unproduced, sequel in the end credits: Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League. The film has since become a cult-classic and elements of it foreshadow the current shared-universe blockbusters.
