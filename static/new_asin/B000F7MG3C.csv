8275773,5,B000F7MG3C,"It is rare to see a DVD showing Tai-chi as a martial art.  This program teaches a 60 movement ""Yang short form"" showing the form from two different angles, with instructions of weight distribution and breathing.  It gives some basic exercises and even teaches the ""push hands"" training at the end of the DVD.  The most interesting part of the program takes up most of it.  This is the step by step instructions with students.  With each movement, there is not only instruction but the self defense applications of that movement as well.  You see the small teacher tossing the larger and obviously stronger students around the room.  I especially like that the applications are not staged and are obviously real.",1147824000,6,711,4.8264462809917354
8275774,1,B000F7MG3C,Bob Klein is a self portrayed Master of Tai Chi and also teaches it as a self defense. I viewed some of his sparring and self defense tapes and in all my years training as a martial artist I have have never seen such a rip off. Mr Klein could not fight his way out of a Kindergarden riot. Because of his deceiving ways I would not take any of his training as serious enlightenment and higly recommend that people seek instruction elsewhere.,1117843200,,440,4.313253012048193
8275775,1,B000F7MG3C,Bob Klein may be one of the best but this video is terrible.  It looks like it was taped in a basement with an old video camera.  It is definately not for someone who is trying this for the first time.  The video was fuzzy and the oration was much too fast.  The moves are not explained and are too quick.  If you are a first timer then there are other videos out there.  Do not waste your money.,1014508800,2,396,3.949367088607595
8275776,5,B000F7MG3C,"This is a great T'ai-chi tape.  It shows that T'ai-chi is a martial art and that you can perform very powerful techniques with very little physical force.  The form is done very beautifully, fluid, relaxed and rooted.  It  is shown from two different angles with complete instructions, including  breathing.  The best aspect of this tape is that, for each movement, it  shows at least one self defense application - and the students go flying  into the walls as they are pushed, punched or kicked.  It's amazing to  contrast the relaxed, slow form with its real life application.  There is  also ""push hands"" instruction at the end.  A really complete  video on T'ai-chi, especially for a martial arts enthusiast.",962755200,4,713,4.932203389830509
8275777,5,B000F7MG3C,"This is a great video to see the self defense applications of each movement.  It teaches a 60 movement Yang short form.  The best thing about it is that you see a little guy tossing a big guy around, using very little  effort.  You don't get that with most T'ai-chi tapes.  Some people forget  that T'ai-chi IS a martial art.  There is also plenty of instruction of how  to do the movements, including proper breathing, weight shifting and the  names of each movement - also the two person push hands exercise.",959299200,,510,4.516483516483516
8275778,5,B000F7MG3C,"This video teaches the 60 movement Yang Short Form.  The form is shown twice, from different angles, once with weight distribution information and the other time with breathing instructions.  Then the form is taught, step  by step, with a student and sample self defense applications of each  movement are shown.  Near the end, basic, beginning push hands is shown  just to give a taste of the next step in T'ai-chi training.  People have  told me they like this video because the self defense applications are  obviously not rehearsed and they give you a clear sense of this aspect of  T'ai-chi.",955670400,2,596,4.87
