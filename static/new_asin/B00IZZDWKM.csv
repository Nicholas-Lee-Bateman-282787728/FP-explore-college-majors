6307744,4,B00IZZDWKM,"I love the movie (Come on now it's RobCop!) however I can't give it a five star review like I wanted to, simply because of the price. I know, I know, $20 is not that much especially for three movies, but no, we're talking about a movie that's decades old, I can get all three Terminators for less!

  Enough about the price lets get into the movie. Definitely recommend viewing these before you see the new remake. The new Robocop was great too but it just doesn't out do the original. this is an older film, 80's, 90's retro, way out dated so I don't think the younger generation will understand, even though it's supposed to be a futuristic hip movie lol.",1402876800,6,657,4.368852459016393

6307785,5,B00IZZDWKM,"The original ROBOCOP was an innovative, bluntly humorous, brutally violent film making a great social comment in quite a frenetic way. It is a classic piece of film making and science fiction. The shockingly gruesome ,sequel ROBOCOP 2 deserves a closer look. The acts of violence and gruesomely graphic cybernetic experimentations performed in this film border on some morbid fascination of grotesque disfiguration of human beings. ROBOCOP 2 starts with a brilliantly filmed exposition stylishly photographed, scored and edited and though violent in nature in demonstrates the moral decay of society where only the fittest can truly survive. Peter Weller as officer Murphy now destined to remain RoboCop is still able to emote sympathy and compassion for his character. Murphy continually drives past the house of where his family resides and he is no longer part of. He wants his identity and his life back. Unfortunately, this aspect of the story is abruptly dropped in favor of Murphy tracking down a lowest of the low drug guru Cain played by Tom Noonan. OCP run by Daniel O'Herlihy is out to replace all human police officers with cyborgs. Detroit never had it so bad. Unfortunately OCP tries to upgrade the RoboCop model with a new cyborg with essentially just the brain and spinal cord of Noonan inserted into a massive and intimidating robot. In the process of this film Murphy's RoboCop becomes an ineffectual tool to the absurd nature of his superiors. He is not even a hero or a blunt instrument. He is just a pawn with total lack of motivation. His confrontation with Cain is anticlimactic and just too over-the-top. The confrontation is not even about good and evil. It is pointless. The entire film is beyond good taste and reason. Who would even want to live in such a dismal society of such moral decay where human beings are reduced to being biological components cut up for parts and inserted into steal and chrome mechanisms. Even Leonard Rosenman's score echoes this depressing outlook and bolsters the idea that there is something quite wrong here. If you are looking for some gratuitous violence of the most perverse, look no further. Luckily ROBOCOP 3 returned at least to a nobler outing for our hero. ROBOCOP 3 is a great Saturday matinee feel to it. ROBOCOP is still the hero and he's getting rid of all the creeps and corrupt corporate bad guys, but without all the graphic violence. It doesn't delve deep into character motivation or empathy or a desire to seek revenge on the baddest of the bad as the original, but it entertains on a comic book level of sorts. There is no R rating and the events and story are aimed at a younger audience and I think this film succeeds at achieving and creating a stand up and cheer movie reminiscent of the films a lot of us older folk grew up with. I think ROBOCOP 3 is a good film. It has a certain style to it and a lot of that is attributed to Basil Poledouris who composed a brilliant score for ROBOCOP and returned to ROBOCOP 3 where he utilized the Robocop theme to great effect. I think his theme is one of the greatest and most rousing ever composed for a hero.",1418083200,,3135,4.701818181818182
