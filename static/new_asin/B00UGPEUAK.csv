Some ordinary men warned against the power of Nazi Germany and the threat to Europe and the whole world. A small family enters the USA as refugees. A steam locomotive takes them from the southwest to their destination in Washington DC: a large mansion owned by a rich and powerful widow. Her daughter Sarah married a German who moved to Rumania. Son-in-law Kurt used to work for Dornier Aircraft, but is now in the business of fighting fascism. Sarahs sister is married to a Rumanian who plays cards at the German embassy and wins money. There is an event at the German Embassy in Washington. Is there conflict between the Nazis and the German aristocracy because of class differences? The charming speech and manners contrast to the intrigue that lies below the surface.

Kurt Muller works as an anti-fascist but it doesnt pay well. [What he does is unmentionable.] People suffered in Germany after the end of the Great War. Then street fighting foretold of the coming storm of Nazi rule. [An over-simplified history?] The Muller family then moved to various European countries. The conversation reveals the history of the characters. Teck snoops into Kurts briefcase and finds a pistol, a medal, and $20,000 in currency. He calls the German Embassy to squeal about Max Freitag. Later Sarah discovers that briefcase and tells Kurt that someone opened it. The news of the capture of Max Freitag in Germany shocks Kurt and Sarah. Will Kurt return to Germany to rescue Max from prison? It will be very difficult, even if the Gestapo doesnt know that Kurt plans to return.

Teck offers to sell information to the Gestapo agent at the Embassy. The price depends on the information. Kurt worries about what Teck can find out about him. Marthe makes a final break with Teck. Teck demands $10,000 to keep his mouth shut. Can he be trusted? Will the deal be reached by a gentlemans agreement? What will be done? What has to be done? Kurt makes a speech to justify his actions and says goodbye.

The speeches show its origin as a stage play. This drama provides a snapshot of popular feeling in the early 1940s. This two-hour film drags in spots, the attitudes are dated. Were the Washington wealthy and politically connected really so naive?",1523059200,,2264,4.782608695652174

This is a W.W.II film about how naive the Americans are about what is going on in Europe. When the fight and ideologies become a reality in their house, they are forced to take sides in the struggle for freedom. Many ideological speeches take place between family members and other acquaintances; this is probably due to being an adaptation from a play. Even though on the surface this looks like an anti-fascist film, it is more complex with people that have diverse motives. However, they show that there is only one way to deal with evil so that future generations will not have to live in terror.",1501977600,,770,4.5
