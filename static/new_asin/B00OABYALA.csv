8682939,5,B00OABYALA,"Im writing this review because if the quality of the blu ray- not the story. I figure anybody buying this knows the story already so why go into detail about that. This is the one to buy for the blu ray version. The price is a little steep but I have not seen sleeping beauty in any stores at all including Best Buy; Walmart, or target. Seems this particular dvd or blu ray is a hard to find one so I finally dropped the cash to get because I feel it fits in with one of the better Disney classics to have. This also comes with the extras in case I forgot to mention including the story of how malificent came to be- not the Angelina Jolies version but cartoon version, as well as some deleted scenes.
Quality of the blue ray and picture is execellent for its age. Remember to movie was made in like 1959 so don't expect this huge high def but it does have the extras that are nice to watch. I have a 4K tv thats only a year old and it looks fantastic to me! Overall you won't be disappointed watching and youll be glad to have it your collection. Not many out there that Ive seen for sale so don't be afraid to bite the bullet on the price if you can swing it.",1520467200,,1161,4.03030303030303
