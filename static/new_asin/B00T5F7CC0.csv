Just send me your receipt to my email porcovete.pictures@gmail.com to and I'll give you the link.",1443398400,,298,4.418181818181818
8700468,4,B00T5F7CC0,"Kind of tongue in cheek at times. Very ""human"" approach to the world of software. It won't bore you with technical jargon. You might think that a documentary on software SHOULD be full of tech talk, but you know what? It doesn't have to be!",1443398400,,240,4.355555555555555
8700469,3,B00T5F7CC0,Subtitles did not appear on the screen for 1/3rd of the interviews not spoken in English. Was so frustrating not knowing what they were saying. I wish I had read the review before purchasing the documentary. Not worth purchasing or watching unless you are fluent in multiple languages or until the subtitles are added. It was fairly interesting despite lack of subtitles.,1441756800,,371,5.0
8700470,3,B00T5F7CC0,"Kind of insightful, kind of boring. They interview numerous people from around the world asking questions about computers and software. Everything from what do you think of piracy to what would you do if you didn't have a computer. Some of the people do not speak English and there are no subtitles so you don't know what they are saying. That is a bit awkward. If you are a software developer like me you might get something out of it, but for regular people this might not be very entertaining.",1440547200,,496,4.522222222222222
