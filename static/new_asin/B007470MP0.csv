5053859,1,B007470MP0,"As a fan who grew up watching Bobby's world on Saturday mornings, I ordered this set knowing fully well that this would be a series of episodes burned on DVD-R media. What I wasn't prepared for was just how poorly the set was made.

First up, as I said, I knew full well this would be a set of DVD-Rs, but I didn't expect nearly every disc to have circular scuffs as if there was a piece of debris on the burner that scratched nearly all the discs. There were maybe a total of 4 discs out of the set of 18 that weren't scuffed. On top of that, it looked like the person doing the burning was eating at the time and left a series of greasy fingerprints on a number of the discs. Fortunately, I haven't run into a disc with playback issues yet, but I'm only a few discs in.

That leads me to the second issue, the video/audio quality. There seems to be a huge range of quality from the handful of episodes I've seen from really poor, to acceptable. A good number of episodes look like they were pulled form youtube and burnt on a disc with very apparent artifacting and very visible scanlines. The audio is also really poor. It seems as if the episodes are slightly sped up and you can really tell that by the pitch of the audio when Howie Mandel speaks.

Had I bought this set when Amazon had it for full price, it would have been completely unacceptabe. Over all I'm not pleased with this set at all, but as a fan of the show, I'm still glad they're available. I would suggest, however, that whomever burns the discs, do so with more care. Hopefully the poor results from Bobby's World don't stop studios from doing consumer on demand DVDs like this for other niche shows like Life with Louie, which really deserves a DVD release.",1376265600,16,1730,4.284403669724771
5053860,5,B007470MP0,I bought this as a bday gift for my husband.  He loved the series when it was on and he was so excited when he opened the package.,1375747200,,130,3.642857142857143
5053861,3,B007470MP0,"For one, the sound quality could be a lot better, it looks like it was transferred from a youtube clip, meaning it's fuzzy and grainy, also completely understandable that season 7 only contains 3 episodes but make it clear that you are combining season 7 and 8. Bought this as a gift and it could have been a cleaner gift, i think. Product still good enough for personal viewing, and Bobby is still the best! :)",1374192000,3,411,4.421052631578948
5053862,1,B007470MP0,the video and sound is not good at all and the company should either fix them or stop selling them,1366156800,2,98,3.95
8509653,1,B007470MP0,"Like others have said drop the price and I'll consider buying.  I'm a huge fan of Bobby's world but I'm not paying $100 for the complete series.  You sold at for $31 at one time according to some of the buyers and that's more reasonable.  For one you're selling em on dvd-r's, two your getting complaints of the quality and sound, three complaints of how bad their packaged and your gonna put a ridiculous price on it like it's gonna sell....  You may fool some gullible people into buying but not me buddy.  If this was Blu-ray then maybe but blank DVDs lol..NO!",1470787200,3,563,4.427184466019417

8509660,5,B007470MP0,"Please put this item back on sale for 31.99?!  There is no way I will pay 160.00 for 8 seasons individually, or 99.99 for the whole set on this listing knowing you sold this for 31.99 once, they are DVD-R's , it should be 31.99!",1392940800,6,228,4.066666666666666
8509661,5,B007470MP0,"I grew up watching this show, and had to buy this set once it was at a great price.  The only negative is that they came in individual DVD cases, taking up  a lot of room.  I was hoping for slim DVD cases if they did not have a special edition packaging.  Oh well.",1386979200,,264,3.8333333333333335
8509662,4,B007470MP0,"Ok first off yes I bought the complete series, but i didn't buy it for 99.99 I waited until it went on sale and bought it for 31.99.  Now on to quality both sound video and overall presentation of the set, overall the sound is good for the most part, but I did notice the opening theme music is sped up a bit, but no big deal. Also some episodes are louder than others but overall they are all pretty much equal. Now video quality is a little bit grainy and fuzzy, BUT REMEMBER IT IS AN OLDER 90's CARTOON ITS NOT GOING TO LOOK ALL THAT GOOD!!! Too many people expected it to be remastered or somehow better quality and give it bad reviews when back in the 90's it probably looked that way anyway, so please take that into consideration before writing a negative review and saying to quote one review I read ""Stop making this set.""

Presentation is meh at at best I thought it was going to have an outer box of some sort but nope all 7 seasons come in there on DVD case. Which brings me to the DVD cases they feel cheap and smell very strongly of plastic. I think Amazon or Moonscoop should ship them in higher quality cases and make some kind of outer box to hold the 7 seasons in. DVD menu is bland with no music they could've put in the main theme but oh well. My biggest complaint is there is no chapters for any episodes on all the seasons. So overall I'd say if you liked Bobby's World buy this set while its on sale for $31.99 NOT FOR $99.99. The most I'd spend is 40 bucks. One more thing the discs are recorded on DVDRs and may take a few tries for some PC's and DVD players to read and they are region free as well so if you live out of the US they are import friendly, but only English audio no subtitles.",1377129600,4,1716,4.07396449704142
