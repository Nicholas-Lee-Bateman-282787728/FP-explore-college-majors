3783134,4,B001S2Q5MG,Fun watch for those into adventure cycling / bike touring.  Not the highest quality video but decent enough.  More of a bike travelogue than anything but an entertaining watch.,1362355200,,176,5.0344827586206895
3783135,2,B001S2Q5MG,"Two likable dudes who do a bike ride. The bike ride however is rather short and kind of uneventful, so they struggle for content. Some funny moments, some nice landscapes, but by no means as extreme or special as some other travel movies.",1350345600,,238,4.558139534883721
3783136,1,B001S2Q5MG,"The movie was rather dull.  The cyclists cover the most general, touristy aspects of Alaska and don't delve into the true wonders of the state.  The ride itself isn't terribly impressive -- the cyclists cover about 50 miles a day, which doesn't test the physical limits of humans like, say, Ride the Divide.

As a person that loves Alaska and loves endurance events, I was very disappointed.",1347235200,,391,4.8059701492537314
3783137,5,B001S2Q5MG,"This is an honest, adventurous and funny film that keeps you riveted.  Inspiring and with amazing scenery, it's definitely time well spent watching this film.  I look forward to their next adventure!",1342828800,,199,5.1875
3783138,5,B001S2Q5MG,"Funny, crazy, wild and adventurous!  Loved every min of their journey and can't wait to buy Paddle To Seattle DVD.",1313884800,,114,4.7
3783139,4,B001S2Q5MG,This is such a simple film. It is relatable like no other nature documentary or film. After watching this movie there is a certain sublime feeling. I highly recommend it.,1287273600,2,170,4.7
3783140,4,B001S2Q5MG,"This is a great video to help through the cabin fever days of winter.  Funny, peaceful and beautiful scenery.",1285027200,2,109,4.7368421052631575
3783141,4,B001S2Q5MG,"This movie was great.  They showed some hardships as well as some of the best moments of the trip, and it really made it relatable even though I've never biked that many miles with full camping gear on me.  I would recommend it for sure to anyone who is wondering if it is worth it.  They go through a lot, and bring the camera right along for the ride.  Definitely inspirational for me and all my friends I made watch it.",1274054400,2,422,4.172839506172839
3783142,5,B001S2Q5MG,Hugely entertaining.  This is a must-see movie.  Two very talented and personable young men - I can't wait to see what they do next!,1272672000,,132,4.458333333333333
8339333,3,B001S2Q5MG,"Interesting trip, but lacked a little in the story.",1463702400,,51,4.777777777777778
8339334,1,B001S2Q5MG,"From a autobiography of their trek through Alaska, it is reveals merely their philosophy about life which of course was not what i was expecting. From my viewpoint, it was superficial.",1462492800,,184,4.967741935483871
8339335,2,B001S2Q5MG,"Too much ""socializing"" and not enough filming on the road of the 1,200 mile expedition by Josh Thomas snd JJ Kelly.",1447632000,,115,4.523809523809524
8339336,1,B001S2Q5MG,"This was really boring. These guys talked in monotones the whole time. There was absolutely no tension other than when the one dude broke his spoke, and that even fell flat. Then the ""toast"" at the end? Those little drinks were just sad. I'm sure these dudes had fun making it and it was a cool ride, but it was a total yawn-fest.",1425081600,,330,4.253968253968254
8339337,4,B001S2Q5MG,Very inspiring.,1421798400,,15,7.0
8339338,5,B001S2Q5MG,Great documentary.  The riders tell a real story and are pretty funny.  Worth a watch.  It's nice to see real people living life to the fullest.,1402012800,,144,4.461538461538462
8339339,5,B001S2Q5MG,This movie makes it clear to me what I want to do and where I need to be! Thanks two Dudes!,1384473600,,91,3.380952380952381
8339340,3,B001S2Q5MG,i lived in Alaska for over 3 year so a lot of this was  filmed in areas i have been before . The film had some funny moments and left you wondering why they did not use a tent instead of tarp? the bugs can be brutal ! I would have liked to have seen more  of a focus on the landscape and wildlife . If your into bike travel you may like it but you can find some better films on you tube for free.,1368230400,2,396,3.5930232558139537
8339341,4,B001S2Q5MG,I am a biker and I love bike movies and books.  This movie was really fun for me because I love ALaska and dream of riding across the state like these two guys did. It could have been a much better movie. I felt like it was flying through their ride. I would have liked more pontificating and more ALaska scenes but I did enjoy this movie and would tell people to watch it.,1368057600,,373,4.04054054054054
8339342,1,B001S2Q5MG,"rented movies from amazon before with no problem,this one froze up same spot first couple minutes every time I tried it. I then watched a movie from netflix and had no problem so I doubt it was pc problem.sent in a technical feedback heard nothing back. Anyone know how to get a refund for dud movies?Tried it again another day,froze same spot again. Impossible to contact anyone at amazon.",1365465600,,390,4.666666666666667
