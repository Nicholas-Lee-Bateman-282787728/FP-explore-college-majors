1065402,5,6305693498,Virtually everybody is corrupt in this movie. Great adventure in the jungle. See the cynical way Bunuel presents the Catholic priest.,1369180800,,133,5.380952380952381
1065403,4,6305693498,"Death in the Garden is an adventure story of sorts, all centered around a group of French expatriates in a small town in an unnamed South American country; there is a priest, a prostitute, an aging prospector, his deaf-mute daughter, and a handsome but antisocial adventurer who may or may not have robbed a bank a couple towns over. Their fates become entwined when the local diamond miners revolt against the governmental authorities, and for different reasons they must all escape the town together when the political situation becomes too volatile.

Overall the film is fairly entertaining and well-made, though in terms of Buuel's oeuvre it would probably only be considered a minor work. The project was not one of the director's own devising but rather that of a French producer who hoped to recreate the success of 1953's Wages of Fear. For his part, Buuel was likely hoping the film would serve as a stepping stone towards finding steady work in Europe. A viewer might even forget that Buuel was involved at all during the somewhat unfocused first half, aside from occasional flashes of dark humor. The second half of the film, however, is extremely memorable and bears all the hallmarks of Buuel's unique take on the cruelties and contradictions of man. The unlikely band of adventurers find themselves traveling through the jungle to the Brazilian border, and in this surreal wilderness the bonds of social convention begin to break apart and new personalities emerge.

The Transflux/Microcinema DVD package is quite nice; there are interesting interviews with actor Michel Piccoli and film scholar Victor Fuentes, an informative running commentary, and a sixteen-page booklet with photographs and essays. The quality of the image is very good considering its age, though the DVD's aspect ratio is not 1.66 as the box describes but rather 1.37 (which was probably the original aspect ratio of the movie).

As a fan of Buuel I was glad to have picked it up, and I think others will find the film enjoyable as well.",1342310400,5,2024,4.982248520710059
1065404,4,6305693498,"In an unidentified South American country, the corrupt government confiscates all diamond mines from private ownership which causes a revolution. A small band of fugitives: an adventurer (Georges Marchal), a prostitute (Simone Signoret), a priest (Michel Piccoli), a miner (Charles Vanel) and his deaf mute daughter (Michele Girardon) escape down the river and into the jungle where they struggle to survive. One of the least seen and discussed of Luis Bunuel's films, it's easy to see why. Not that it's bad, quite the contrary, it's very good but it doesn't fit easily into the Bunuel canon. On the surface, it's a colorful (shot in Eastman color) jungle adventure seemingly not all that different from its Hollywood brethren. Quite different from the irreverently playful Bunuel that would dominate the 1960s art houses. But it's characters are all highly flawed, some physically and some morally and some psychologically. Bunuel's bleak ending and possible symbolism (I'm not sure but Piccoli's priest seems to be some kind of Christ figure) separate it from the glossy jungle adventures Hollywood was grinding out in the 1950s. A warning: there's actual animal cruelty (not simulated) in the film so be prepared.

The DVD courtesy of Transflux is a handsome, sharp and colorful transfer in its 1.33 aspect ratio.",1337817600,2,1317,5.241706161137441
1065405,3,6305693498,"Disjointed, wondering, and uninspiring.  I could not get involved with this one. Great actors in an overly negative screenplay. Fun to watch her walk around on screen as usual.",1320624000,,176,5.068965517241379
1065406,5,6305693498,"I have to agree with one of the reviewers ""Death in the Garden"" (from 1956) was an excellent Bu&ntilde;uel film. The story was an easy one to figure out: the influence of power, corruption, and greed (especially the kind represented by established authority), that brings out the worse in people. The cinematography was quite good, and an excellent cast was assembled: Simone Signoret, Georges Marchal, Michel Piccoli, Charles Varnel and Tito Junco. Here, Bu&ntilde;uel gave us an excellent study on the ""Law of the Jungle"" (a very large part of humankind, is operating on its lowest-based nature), and its causal effect on most of so-called civilization. I can just imagine how far Luis Bu&ntilde;uel would have gone, if it were not for state-censorship and a hostile and close-minded audience.

This was a Franco-Mexican co-production. The DVD picture quality was very good. NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 104 mins.

1065407,4,6305693498,"A very good movie of Bunuel's mexican period. This movie contains one of the early appereancies of Michel Piccoli in the role of a missionaire in a south american village. The last half hour where the fugitives wander into the jungle is pure surrealism, there are at least three classic scenes.

1065409,3,6305693498,"Just a warning to mind the aspect ratio: the only time you see this movie in the advertised 1:66 ratio is in the brief clips illustrating the Fuentes interview. The feature itself is full-screen 4x3 - which is how it was originally issued, according to IMDB.com.

The 'wide' clips are actually cropped (top & bottom) versions of the 4x3.",1258156800,7,337,4.711864406779661
1065410,5,6305693498,"I love most of Bunuel's films but ""Death In the Garden"" is definitely my absolute favorite, ahead of ""Los Olvidados,"" and even ""Viridiana."" This film is as close to perfection as you can get, even though some critics like to call it a 'flawed' film. The 'flaws' in this film are further aspects of its pefection, if you ask me. It has its lunatic elements and a few supernatural angles like all Bunuel films, but it also showcases the 'romantic' side of the man too often labeled a pessimist. The totally 'amoral' yet not unadmirable Georges Marchal character ""Shark"" is the closest thing to an Yves Montand/Wages-of-Fear type 'hero' Bunuel ever got.  What can I tell you? SEE THIS FILM, IT'S A MASTERPIECE.  On the surface ""Death in the GArden"" is a ""Wages of Fear"" like adventure story (Charles Vanel from Clouzot's masterpiece is one of the main characters) where a bunch of people are put under pressure and forced to work together and  survive. The people putting the pressure on are the military 'fascists' not the industrialist-fascists of ""Wages of Fear."" The story happens in a South American state, where a bunch of Diamond miners are being chased out by the corrupt military government. When a small-scale civil war breaks out, the leaders of the rebels become hunted men, and they have to escape by boat, ending up in a rain-soaked amazon jungle trying to get to Brazil. The characters have to cooperate and survive under an increasingly hopeless situation and reveal fascinating aspects of themselves in the process. There are no moral black and whites, of course, no steretypes either, but only a dynamically evolving morality shaded in different grays leaning toward the black here, toward the white there.  You come to have a deep level of sympathy with almost every main character in the film, even Simone Signoret's avaricious Madame, but only after examining them as totally flawed human beings capable of many bizzare deeds, some admirable, others despicable, etc. The film has everything that makes greatness, layers and more layers:  deep characters, adventure, action, pessimism, romanticism, eroticism, hilariously absurd farcical scenes, identification with religion while remaining anticlerical, a complete lack of sentimentality, fantastic color cinematography (very lush and colorful, almost Renoir-like, and unlike most of Bunuel's other color films), unbelievably great acting by Georeges Marchal, Simone Signoret, Charles Vanel, and a young Michel Piccoli, it even has a beautiful young deaf girl whose long hair gets stuck in a tree! What more could you want? Maltin must be out of his mind to give this film only 3 stars!",980035200,25,2654,5.1200923787528865

7893808,5,6305693498,"Be sure to watch the entire film because the last half tells almost an entirely different story.  Several interesting character archetypes tie the two halves together.  The first hour deals with sudden marxism in a particular South American military garrison town. Bunuel clearly believed it's true aims are to violently deprive man of any fruits of his own labor.  Just before the town becomes boring or tedious, our now somewhat understandable characters find themselves being pursued deep into the Amazon jungles.  I will admit the final act doesn't quite make sense on a literal level, but the symbolism is so original that it explores broader and more mysterious truths about human nature that cannot be easily quantified.  I'm not sure any other film has even attempted to plow this ground.",1477526400,,796,5.092307692307692

7893811,5,6305693498,"La mort en ce jardin (""Death in the Garden"") is a 1956 film by director Luis Buuel based on the novel by Jose-Andre Lacour.  Amid a revolution in a South American mining outpost, a band of fugitives - a roguish adventurer (Georges Marchal), a local hooker (Simone Signoret), a priest (Michel Piccoli), an aging diamond miner (Charles Vanel) and his deaf-mute daughter (Michle Girardon) - are forced to flee for their lives into the jungle. Starving, exhausted and stripped of their old identities, they wander desperately lured by one deceptive promise of salvation after another. Shot in vibrant Eastmancolor and featuring a star-studded cast, Death in the Garden is an adventure film with Surrealist gestures and symbolism. Additional dialogue was written by Raymond Queneau.

7893813,3,6305693498,"Im not entirely familiar with Bunuels work.  I have seen a few of his films, and absolutely love Exterminating Angel, but as a whole I just don't know enough about his work to judge him as a whole, but what I can do is judge what I have seen on their own merits.  I cant pit it against his other work or tell you how it falls in with where his career was or where his filmography was headed at the time.  Maybe having a broader knowledge of an individual director can help one to appreciate or even glean from a particular film, but in most cases a film really needs to be able to stand alone to make the largest impact, and for me Death in the Garden just didn't do that.

While the concept here, or the general storyline, was compelling, I felt like nothing really came together cohesively and instead of creating something that felt profound (which is obviously where the finale was trying to head), the film felt scattered and underdeveloped.  So many themes and plot points twisting into one another gives Death in the Garden a sense of chaos.  It needed a stronger focus.  Instead, this feels like two or three different films colliding into one another, producing something that feels incomplete.  The ensemble is decent at best, with Michel Piccoli being the only true standout.  This is painful to admit, considering how much I generally love Simone Signoret (shes good here, but feels like a caricature in many parts).  The writing just wasn't up to par, which was not what I was expecting at all.",1400544000,,1507,4.527675276752768
