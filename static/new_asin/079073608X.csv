111546,2,079073608X,"Hammer Studios never seemed more out of touch than when they released this attempt to bring the Christopher Lee/Peter Cushing Dracula movies to the present day.  The groovy party scene is right up there with Skidoo (1968) and The Happening (1967)--two campy and wildly unsuccessful attempts by mainstream Hollywood to capture the spirit of the day's youth without any understanding of what young people were actually like.

As for plot Dracula A.D. 1972 essentially recycles the set-up from Taste the Blood of Dracula.  In that 1970 Hammer dud a young man tricked a group of libertines into reviving Count Dracula by performing a black mass with the powdered blood of Dracula.  In Dracula A.D. 1972 a young man tricks a group of hippies into reviving Count Dracula by performing a black mass with the powdered blood of Dracula.

This has exactly one clever shot--during the opening period scene Van Helsing dies while killing Dracula, whose body turns to dust.  Then the camera pans up to the sky as an airplane flies by and the title Dracula A.D. 1972 comes onscreen.  Cool but unfortunately that turns out to be the highlight of the film.  It's not like it would have been impossible to bring Dracula and Van Helsing into the present day--AIP essentially did that just fine with its Count Yorga films--but Dracula A.D. 1972 doesn't feel genuinely modern--it feels like an old-fashioned period Hammer film simply updated with some awkward pseudo-contemporary dialogue.

Christopher Lee's Dracula is underutilized and Peter Cushing seems to literally be playing the same character as always even though he is supposed to be the grandson of the Van Helsing from the other movies.  Not giving Peter Cushing the ability to riff on his classic character by giving the grandson some different personality traits was a pretty big wasted opportunity.  The actress playing Van Helsing's grand-daughter, Stephanie Beacham, could easily have been the lead in any of Hammer's period films.  Dracula A.D. 1972 doesn't include any updated police methods that weren't around when the period films took place and after the goofy opening party scene and silly black mass the characters in Dracula A.D. 1972 don't seem to have any attitudes or personality traits that would have been out of place in the period films--in other words Hammer doesn't really try very hard to update the established formula of its period horror films which were already running out of gas creatively.  In the end the only positive thing I can say about Dracula A.D. 1972 is that it's much, much better than its sequel, The Satanic Rites of Dracula, which inexplicably brought back the same screenwriter/director combo that was responsible for this one.  Dracula A.D. 1972 is Hammer in sharp decline, something that probably could have been avoided if Hammer had invested in younger filmmakers and actors rather than using the same stars they had employed since the 1950's.",1435968000,,2934,5.060165975103734

The best part of the film is the action-filled pre-credits sequence with Lee and Cushing battling it out.  Unfortunately Hammer's Gothic horrors were never meant for modern times and the mix of vampires and hippies doesn't gel very well.  A shame considering Don Houghton wrote two of the best Jon Pertwee-era ""Doctor Who"" stories- ""Inferno"" (1970) and ""The Mind of Evil"" (1971).  That said ""The Satanic Rites of Dracula"" (1973) isn't much better. It's shorter and slower.",1408838400,,605,5.0

This was one hundred years latter and yet Dracula's grave sight was found with no means to know how it was found by this one individual. Christopher Lee was really old in this one with not much energy to convince anyone he could be anything, but an old man who wanted to be a Vampire and never returned to his lair as it is usually the case in most of the vampire movies. His victims come to him and he does not have to go out to seek them. It reminded me of calling for a Pizza cause you are just to tired to make in effort and that is what this movies was really about., "" Just a tired old movie that had never been a classic and could not die.",1407456000,2,712,3.9444444444444446
111563,4,079073608X,"Apparently this was a flop for Hammer and one of the last gasps of that studio in its first incarnation, but I found it to be one of the better Hammer Draculas.  Watching it from 2014 no doubt helps a bit, because the whole ""it's Dracula...in craaazy, modern 70s London"" thing adds its charm.  And the bizarre scene is set early on by a groovy concert of craaazy counter-culture types putting on a rock show in some uptight English person's flat.  Did they just burst in, amps and all, and start rocking out and it just takes the coppers way too long to arrive?  Where they invited at some point?  Whatever.  It's great to watch this whole ""hey, young moviegoing kids, we're not dusty, boring goth period pieces anymore at Hammer.  No, we're 'with it.'  We're hip.""  LIke Dr. Evil trying to bond with his punk son, Scott, in Austin Powers.  But quickly we get to the good stuff.  One of the kids, endeavoring to make life ever more ""kick ass,"" decides to go the whole Black Mass route (although perhaps with some greater goal in mind than simply acting like the goth kids after school....??).  But will it all work out as expected, this Faustian attempt to deal with the dread Dracula?  Or have they [ahem] bit off more than they can chew?

So you get the scholarly Cushing warning against dabbling in the Black Magics, Christopher Lee looking awesome and menacing, and Caroline Munro and Stephanie Beacham looking amazing.  But just as important a star, as always, is the trademark Hammer aesthetic: the sets, the fog, the spooky atmosphere...it works its dark magic still.",1400198400,2,1574,4.6521739130434785

111565,4,079073608X,"Alright, putting Dracula in a 70s setting is a silly idea, particularly to Stoker purists (Christopher Lee included).

However, this is an outrageously entertaining movie. Unlike every other Hammer Dracula, except for the first, this one zips along; these movies are notorious for their snail-like pace.

It helps that the film is visually beautiful, especially when compared to the low-budget Scars of Dracula and the badly photographed Satanic Rites. The return of Peter Cushing in itself takes the film to a higher level than the previous sequels, thanks to his inimitably credible style of acting. And I, for one, love the overblown 70's soundtrack.

Christopher Lee was quick to disown this movie, but he felt that way about all the sequels, some of which are much more highly regarded than this one. In this film he returns to that animal-like nature that makes his Dracula stand out, unlike the more muted performances in Scars and Taste The Blood of Dracula. His screen time is limited, but more effective than any of the sequels.

This is not a great vampire or horror movie, but it's a great popcorn flick and fun to watch during an evening at home.",1381363200,2,1159,4.868020304568528
111566,2,079073608X,"...that was my assessment in 1972 when I was 20 years old and right in the middle of the target demographic for this film. What would my reaction be 40 years later? Pretty much the same and for the same reasons. I hated the music, I hated the ""totally cool"" dialogue which was outdated in '72, and I hated the fact that Christopher Lee was barely in the film (although I can't blame him). That was also the verdict of my circle of friends when we compared notes later on. I have no problem with Dracula being in the modern world as the next (and final) film, THE SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA, showed that with good performances and a focus on story, it seemed perfectly natural. Aside from fashions, that film hasn't dated at all.

DRACULA A.D. 1972 wasn't a total loss. There was always Peter Cushing's Van Helsing and the resuscitation of Dracula in the church was effectively rendered. His demise was also effectively gruesome and was the film's highlight for us young folks. Stephanie Beacham's Jessica Van Helsing was nice to look at but nothing she said had any staying power whatsoever. Point of fact was I can't remember a single Hammer film that I forgot faster than this one. Unlike most of the others, nothing in A.D. 1972 stayed with me at all. Perhaps it was a concious effort to forget it. It also marked the last time that I saw a Hammer film in a theater on its first run. The rest would come in drive-ins and were older titles that I had missed the first time around or simply went to see again.

The biggest difference between seeing the film at 20 and at 60 is how I perceive the film. Today I can clearly see that DRACULA A.D. 1972 is a movie made by older people who thought they knew how younger people behaved and what they wanted. It's clearly a film from a studio in transition trying as best they could to hold onto younger viewers who were slipping away to watch the stronger stuff then coming out of Italy and America. Nothing dates faster than a film that tries to be up-to-the-minute and it is this movie's remarkably ""hip"" script that really sinks it. It is interesting to note that, as another reviewer pointed out, this is the previous film, TASTE THE BLOOD OF DRACULA, updated from 1870 to 1970. Good idea, bad execution. If you're a Hammer fan it's worth it for the chance to see old friends but others beware unless you happen to dig groovy fashions and even groovier dialogue.",1379116800,3,2409,4.4603174603174605
111567,4,079073608X,"I was in for watching some horror films, and this one is certainly not too bad, though can be awkward to those who expect it to be your medieval horror film, but it doesn't stop it from being a good one, though I personally preferred Horrors of Dracula from 1958. It is just different, but does still contain some of the classic medieval horror.",1376524800,,345,4.40625
111568,5,079073608X,"This film was mentioned on the podcast OST (Original Soundtrack Show) when Mr. Trunk had Garth Merenghi on as a guest. It sounded like good fun, ""teenagers who aren't really teenagers"" so I checked it out.

I'm not a knowledgeable source of the genre, but I really enjoyed the campy ""dig it, baby"" feel of the story. Plus with Peter Cushing AND Christopher Lee in the same film, you know it's going to be worthwhile. Keep in mind it's 1972, not 2002, so it moves at a slower pace and the special effects aren't CGI. More like duct tape, dry ice and very fake blood. Funtime.",1376092800,,574,4.415094339622642

111570,5,079073608X,Love that the producers decided to bring Dracula into the 20th century. The colors and photography in this film are the best. I sometimes wonder why Hollywood stopped making films in Technicolor? Considering that the latest movies are so dull I think they should shoot them again in this format because it will at least make the current crop of films more cinematic. CG effects are not enough and this film proves that you really don't need them to tell a compelling story.,1373932800,2,473,4.710843373493976

111584,5,079073608X,"Let's be honest here, in the 80's vampires were starting to transform into what they are now...fruits. Also this is my second favorite Dracula movie (right behind the 1931 film) for a variety of reasons: the cast is mainly hot youngsters looking for kicks, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing's roles could not be played by anyone else and even with it's minimal production value, it turned out great.
In a way, the plot is quite decent with additional excitement from a story of revenge. Kids of the 70's get bored and the solution is to have a black mass (I have seen hundreds of horror films but THIS one has the best black mass sequences I've ever seen) which resurects Dracula from the grave.
I cherish this movie because it is, without a doubt, the last vampire movie that is considerably scary.",1340409600,4,799,4.633802816901408
111585,2,079073608X,"Badly dated (even when it was released back in the day), ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" benefits primarily from the presence of both Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. Aside from a dazzling opening where Dracula (Lee) battles Lawrence Van Helsing (Cushing)in the past, the bulk of the film is set in the 70's. Dracula is resurrected in contemporary London and decides to go after Van Helsing's descendants including Abraham's (Cushing)daughter.

Director Alan Gibson does the best he can with a tired, cliched script that doesn't make the best use of its stars and abuses the intelligence of the audience (Van Helsing doesn't seem like the sharpest tool in th shed when it takes a bit for him to realize that Johnny Alcuard is, well, a disciple of Dracula because of his last name).

The Transfer for ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" looks pretty good. Colors don't exactly pop but they look quite nice. The transfer does have some problems with timing for the day-for-night scenes (as was pointed out back in 2005 in Video Watchblog Column)but, aside from that point, the film looks pretty good for a 1970's film.

The mono audio presentation sounds pretty good with dialogue crisp and clear.

The special features are limited to only a very unintentionally funny trailer. It's a pity we don't get a commentary track for this film.

The film isn't bad but lacks originality, vitality and the spark that was present in ""Horror of Dracula"", ""Brides of Dracula"" and even ""Dracula Prince of Darkness"" are all sorely missing.",1327708800,2,1497,4.924603174603175
111586,5,079073608X,I don't understand the negative reviews. This is an excellent movie on a excellent DVD. I'm a huge fan of Hammer Horror. And a huge fan of Lee and especially Peter Cushing.

111587,2,079073608X,"Just some thoughts...

Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972) is an example of Hammer Productions taking their whole Dracula series of movies a little too far.  Here we have a Dracula movie that takes place in 1972.  Hammer took the Dracula character and inserted him into a modern setting.  In my opinion, this just doesn't work very well.  The fact that Hammer wanted to branch out and make sequels to their first Dracula movie, Horror Of Dracula (1958) is one thing, but these sequels and especially this 1972 movie in particular have nothing to do with Bram Stoker's novel.  Basically they invented sequels to Stoker's novel.  I give Hammer credit for their imagination and putting their own spin on things, but to me Dracula should only belong in a movie based on Stoker's novel.  I think Hammer's intention was to make Dracula A.D. 1972 fun and entertaining, and for it not to be taken that seriously.  It starts out lighthearted and fun, but then the second half of the movie slows down considerably.  I think that if the movie's mood and atmosphere would have been more consistent, I'd give it a full 3 stars, maybe 3 1/2 stars.

The acting in this movie is pretty good.  The hippies are passable.  The movie is very cheesy, but Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee perform well in their respective roles as Van Helsing and Dracula.

All in all, a very different kind of Dracula movie, to say the least.  If you like camp and a unique spin on things, then give this one a try.",1301356800,2,1467,4.588461538461538
111588,4,079073608X,"Dracula AD 1972 is without a doubt, the most unappreciated Dracula film ever created, and that includes the NON Hammer ones...Many compare this to Taste the Blood of Dracula, as they have a very similar plot...the main part being resurrecting Dracula via a bizarre ritual performed by individuals who have no idea whatsoever what they are messing with, they just want a thrill plain and simple...well they get a thrill alright, and then some...the difference between AD 72 and Taste the Blood is most noticeably the former taking place in modern times (hippy counter culture time period), and the latter taking place in the 19th century sometime...this change in time period makes for a refreshing take on the Hammer Dracula series, which by the time Taste the Blood had come out, was starting to get a bit old...it worked for the first few, but was in need of a change...on a side note, Scars of Dracula, which was in between Taste the Blood and AD 72, was arguably the best Dracula film ever made, but doesn't get the credit it's due, although it doesn't get bashed nearly as much as AD 72 does...anyways, the character development is mediocre as usual, aside from the main character(s), but it's developed enough that you do in fact care about the people Dracula is planning to feast on...having Peter Cushing back as Van Helsing definitely helped...now let's be real here, of course we are always rooting for Count Dracula because Christopher Lee is just TOO cool and impossible to dislike, but there is the occasional film where you care about the other characters, and this film does achieve that contrary to popular belief...the ambiance is there, music, scenery, etc...and for once the police actually seem relatively competent and interested in stopping Dracula from continuing his murder spree...you get everything that you should get from a Hammer Dracula flick, but you ALSO get a nice change of pace with the 100+ year fast forward and seeing Dracula operate in modern times...to boot, Chris Lee hasn't yet showed he is entirely sick of portraying the Count, that comes in the next and final Hammer film, Satanic Rights...there he is obviously tired of it, and it shows...much like Sean Connery in his final Bond film Diamonds are Forever, etc...so all in all, there is very little to complain about here...no it's not perfect, yes it's flawed to some degree, but to all the naysayers, cmon, give this one a break, it actually IS pretty decent...it has more going for it than Taste the Blood, Satanic Rights, and possibly even Risen From the Grave...no, it's not as good as Horror of Dracula or Prince of Darkness, but what do you expect by this point?  nothing is ever as good as the originals...",1297382400,,2710,4.8405172413793105

Dracula 1972 AD has gotten some bad reviews and holds little credibility as a horror film, especially one with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, but it has it's charm. The film's time and place in the 70's may have made it easy to sweep under the rug but in the resurgance of Hammer Horror and the rapid growing DVD market make this film a beautiful gem.

However with all that said, it is a good time, only I think it can be appreciated now, and not then.

The film takes place time line wise right at the end of Taste the Blood of Dracula and throws Van Helsing conveniently there as Dracula is dying then fast forwards a hundred years, yes the math doesn't add up, to the present of where the film takes place. Comparing Horror of Dracula with say the first Black Sabbath album then safely saying Dracula 1972 AD can be if Black Sabbath attempted to record an album in space is about the same level of seriousness you can take this film.",1266192000,,1612,4.355481727574751
111614,3,079073608X,"Dracula A.D. 1972 is a campy instalment in the Dracula series made by Hammer Films. The gist of the movie is that Dracula gets resurrected in 1972 by a young acolyte, Johnny Alucard and seeks to destroy the remaining Van Helsings, i.e. Dr Van Helsing [Peter Cushing] and his beautiful, hippie granddaughter Jessica [Stephanie Beacham].

Though Christopher Lee reprises his role as the malevolent count, his screen time is quite limited and I felt too much screen time was wasted on portraying the debauchery and free-swinging lifestyle of 70s Hippie culture - drugs, sex and rock n roll. But, when he does appear, Lee is magnetic as the count and doesn't disappoint in his performance.

But the best performance in this movie is Peter Cushing's 20th century Van Helsing - he is assured, intelligent and above-all single-minded in his determination to save his granddaughter Jessica from the vampire's clutches. Stephanie Beacham is luscious to look at and feisty in her portrayal as the strong-willed Jessica.

The rest of the actors were ho-hum - a bit overdone in some instances [the guy who played Johnny Alucard for example].

All in all, this isn't a great Dracula movie, but it isn't the worst either.",1226361600,,1207,4.96039603960396
111615,4,079073608X,"England's Hammer Studios did 8 Dracula films from 1958-1973:

Horror of Dracula (1958)
Brides of Dracula (1960)
Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966)
Dracula has Risen from the Grave (1968)
Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970)
Scars of Dracula (1970)
Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972)
The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973)

Christopher Lee plays the Count in all but ""The Brides of Dracula"" and ""The Legend 7 Golden Vampires."" Peter Cushing also stars in four entries as Van Helsing.

By the time of the seventh film the creative well was apparently running dry and Hammer decided to spice up the series by bringing the Count to present-day London (1972, of course), which was Hammer's response to other successful vampire films at the time taking place in the modern day, such as ""The Night Stalker,"" ""Blacula"" and ""Count Yorga."" The story revolves around a group of hip counter-culture youths performing a black mass in an abandoned church for kicks (although the ringleader takes it serious) and they revive the blood-sucking prince of darkness. Havok ensues.

Peter Cushing appears as Van Helsing's descendant. Christopher Neame plays the nutjob who performs the black mass with utter relish. Also on hand are the stunning beauties Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro. Stephanie plays Van Helsing's daughter and Caroline has a small but significant role. There are a couple of other early-70s hippie babes as well.

The first half of the film borrows heavily from the previous ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" in that the Count is resurrected in roughly the same manner, although ""Taste"" is more effective. Which isn't to say that ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" isn't a decent entry in the series, albeit bizarre. The main problem with the film is that the story doesn't seem to know what to do once Dracula is resurrected. For instance, Cushing's final battle with the Count is fairly lame for various reasons (I don't want to give anything away), not to mention Lee only appears for about 10 minute in the entire film, which is usual for the series, of course.

Another problem is the score. It screams ""early 70s"" in a bad way, but doesn't mesh with what is essentially a serious horror flick. Of course some would cite that as part of its charm. I said ""serious horror flick, by the way, because this is not a goofy or campy flick despite the colorful hippie elements and lousy score.

What works best is that it's a great period piece. You'll get a groovy glimpse of England's counter-culture, including the hippie girls and a live performance by the band Stoneground (who didn't go anywhere beyond this movie, likely because their sound & style was already passe by 1972). So, the first half is fun and compelling, whereas the second half just sort of goes through the motions and peters out.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" is hard to rate because, despite the mediocre-ness of the story's second half, the film is a fun experience with numerous highlights. Hence, as a Dracula story I give it a C+, but for entertainment value I give it a solid B or B+.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in England.

111616,3,079073608X,"For reasons known only to the author, Bram Stoker's Dracula never included the line ""Sergeant, I'll bet you a pound to a pinch of s**t that there's a little piece of hash at that party, and if there is, I've got them."", but the early 70s saw that particular oversight put right. Dracula A.D. 1972 saw Hammer trying to pump new life into the old Count with a new creative team whose big idea was basically to rehash the plot of Taste the Blood of Dracula in the 1970s with Christopher Neame in the Ralph Bates role as Johnny Alucard, here conning a thrill-seeking group of with it kids (Michael Kitchen and Caroline Munro among them) into making a date with the Devil with a Black Mass at the deconsecrated church that not only holds Lawrence Van Helsing's body (Lawrence? Whatever happened to Abraham?) and Dracula's ashes. ""Okay, okay. But if we do get to summon up the big daddy with the horns and the tail, he gets to bring his own liquor, his own bird and his own pot.""

As with the Godzilla films, the main attraction is kept off the screen for most of the running time - top-billed Christopher Lee's role is probably smaller in this than any other in the series, four brief scenes probably totalling no more than ten minutes. Worse still, looking more like Peter Sellers than Transylvanian aristocracy, he brings nothing except continuity to the part: he does what is asked of him with professionalism, but that's about it. Instead the bulk of the film is carried by Neame's Malcolm McDowell wannabe, second-billed Peter Cushing as Van Helsing's grandson Lorimar, Stephanie Beacham and Michael Coles' open-minded cop (""There is a Satan."" ""Of course. Otherwise we wouldn't need a police force, would we?""). Yet despite the clumsily handled prologue and finale it's fairly entertaining even if it is completely derivative, perhaps even more entertaining now than when it was released because its hip and happening trappings are far funnier than the intentional comic relief - not least Johnny Alucard urging ""Dig the music, kids!"" during the black mass - and it's a lot better than Dracula 2000.

The DVD also includes the wonderfully over the top trailer - ""Are you ready? He's ready. He's waiting to freak you out - right out of this world!"" - but not the short making of documentary from when the picture was still called Dracula Today (other rejected titles included Dracula Chases the Mini Girls and Dracula Chelsea '72!).",1204675200,3,2431,4.771971496437055
111617,3,079073608X,"Christopher Lee's Dracula comes back again, this time in Swingin' London of the early 70s. It is a misguided idea of Hammer still trying to cash in on the name of the Count. Considering Hammer's ""Dracula"" saga started back in 1958, it is obvious that they should have stopped by the late 60s when things changed drastically in pop culture. But they did make this one, which turned out an unintentional comedy (sort of) with blood-sucking vampires and ""funky"" rock music.

Once again Dracula returns. The man responsible for his resurrection is named ""Johnny Alucard"" (Christopher Neame) - yes, ""Alucard"" - and there is a young beautiful woman named Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham), niece of Peter Cushing's Professor Van Helsing. So now you know the rest of the story. In short, Dracula seeks the blood of her.

Though the film is not scary and its plot is very thin, ""Dracula 72"" is full of overacting and silly dialogues that are not boring to see. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing do their best, and their performances surely raise the level of this film one notch higher. Lee's screen time is limited, but it is amazing to see dead serious Peter Cushing doing a great job (as he always does) in this otherwise delightfully messy film. Oh, and don't forget Caroline Munro and her character ""Laura"" screaming.",1203379200,2,1320,4.836283185840708
111618,5,079073608X,"that tag line above is taken from the theatrical trailer that comes with this DVD. actually the trailer itself is a very nice appetizer for the movie and I'm glad it was included with the disc. the film itself begins with a flashback to the year 1872, one hundred years before the main body of the story begins. from the first frames of dry leaves blowing along a carriage path in London's Hyde Park a careening coach appears in view with a struggle aboard involving the evil Count Dracula vs. the honorable Professor Van Helsing. when the carriage capsizes the Count is left fatally wounded with a pierced wagon wheel spoke entering his heart.
The Professor dies in the accident but as the Count is reduced to ash a young assistant comes along to scoop up an amount of the ashes which he buries in a churchyard not far away.
we are then taken to modern times (1972)and a party at a posh London home.
the party is highlighted by the rock group Stoneground but apparently some hippy flotsam and jetsam have slithered onto the scene much to the distaste of the lady of the house! these slithering but groovy young people that have made themselves welcome at the party include Jessica Van Helsing the great granddaughter of the Professor.  Also part of the group is Johnny Alucard(Dracula spelled backwards), a descendent of the assistant who had gathered the Counts' ashes 100 years earlier. As an aside, it was a treat to see Sal Valentino, the leader of Stoneground singing Alligator Man at the party. Sal used to be in the Beau Brummels. He kind of sounds like Dr. John when he sings. But anyway, after the party is shut down by the men in uniform via complaints from the Grande Dame, the crew dash off for drinks at a coffee bar called The Cavern. It is here that Johnny tries to lure his friends into a ritualistic 'black mass' that he will conduct that night, much to everyone's nervous apprehension. Everyone that is except Laura from the group played by Caroline Munro who finds it all quite exciting and cheerily suggests ""it could be a giggle"". well, later that night as they all gather inside a darkened candle-lit gothic church set for demolition(de-sanctified) Johnny begins his black magic, casting a deep spell upon them and building up to an unholy sacrifice. Laura volunteers and to everyone's horror is soon dabbled with blood and ashes from the 100 year old Count. Everything goes very badly very quickly and the friends flee from the scene too scared to answer Laura's cry's for help. Johnny, you see, has taken his heritage to heart and to rise 'the master' up from the unsacred ground is his mission, and poor Laura is his pawn. And yes, the master does emerge from the depths and eyes the present of Laura that Johnny has prepared for him. A word here about the performance of Christopher Lee as Dracula. Watching the actor's very expressive face was wonderful to watch. Merging from calm and steady to bloodthirsty lust to frightening aggression and even later as he falls under attack and is fearing for his life(or, unlife, i suppose)is a study of the actors repetoire of facial expertise. The next day all the friends meet again at The Cavern very worried about the absence of Laura. Johnny assures them she's just out of town. No one buys it and sure enough Laura is found dead outside the grounds of the old church. The Inspector from Scotland Yard eyes the corpse of a girl with seemingly all the blood drained out of her. He seeks out someone he believes can help with this gruesome murder, the grandson of Professor Van Helsing(Peter Cushing). Van Helsing gets on the case right away and is especially concerned as the dead girl was in his granddaughters circle of friends. I think i'll leave it at that and conclude by saying this is an excellent thriller from the early 1970's.",1182988800,7,3809,4.642962962962963
111619,5,079073608X,"I have had a huge crush on Stephanie Beacham ever since I first saw this movie. What a beautiful face. What
glamourous hair, what an incredible body. She is amazing. I had always been aware of Miss Beacham, but my
crush began when I saw Dracula AD 1972 on VHS in 1994. At the climax of the film, she wears the sexiest white gown ever shown in a horror film. Amazing

Someone requested that I go into more detail about the plot of the movie.
The plot is great, thoiugh it does reuse some ideas from Taste the Blood of Dracula. But thats no crime.
The fights are exciting. Peter Cushing is fantastic as always. Since he is playing the grandson (Lorimer)
of the original Van Helsing, he plays him slightly differently. He cauld have just done the same old shtick, but he goes the extra mile. (I remember the day he died, it made big international news.) Stephanie Beacham has a wonderful softness to her. Her hair, face, figure, voice and wardrobe all posses this quality. Christopher Neame is good as the villain ""Alucard"" a descendent of one of Draculas relatives. Caroline Munro has a small part, but is good. Lee is kept off camera a little too much, but just a little.
Like the other Hammer Draculas, more obscure vampire legends are utilized here. They cant cross rushing water and anything that is ""symbolically"" pure is fatal to a vampire.
My only gripe is about the ""timeline"" in which this film is set. The opening prologue is set in 1872 and depicts the final violent deaths of both Dracula and Lawrence VanHelsing. For purposes of continuity, this makes no sense. The first film in the series Horror of Dracula was set in 1885. (the book is set in 1887) Each sequel that followed almost always gave you an update on how many months had passed since the last film took place. Scars of Dracula, the film released just prior to Dracula 1972, took place in the early 1900s (modern
conveniences such as electrical fixtures are seen. Modern guns and reflectors are shown. (there has always been some debate about the timeframe of Scars, but thats for a different review) The final film in the series, Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires, shows Lawrence and his son Leland (presumably Lorimer's father)
alive and well in 1904.  So this must be some parallel universe or something.
Actually, Producer Michael Carreras has commented on this mistake, and admits that it is just that; a mistake.
Carreras also admits that, though such issues were not as important to fans back then, they should have
been more careful. So at least Hammer noticed. I recommend that any of you ""timeliners"" out there just ignore this obvious mistake and place the 1872 prologue after Seven Golden Vampires where it belongs.",1173657600,5,2702,4.67436974789916

111632,4,079073608X,"The results are obviously mixed on this one.  Since the series has grown kinda..eh..long in the tooth, Hammer decided to try something different and stick Dracula in modern times.  Personally, I've always felt that Dracula never belonged in modern times and attempts to do that have all been disasterous(see Dracula 2000 for a good example).  I have to admit though that I love this film.  Does it work?  That depends on who you ask, but I say it does.  It actually works on two levels.  Everything in this film is 100% in your face early 70s London.  The fashion, the lingo, the music, none of it is background, it's almost overdone!  I'm not sure if director Gibson was trying way too hard to be cool, or simply making a kind of parody.  On that level the film is fun for schlock.  When Cushing and Lee are on camera, it feels like a Hammer flick regardless of the hippy teens.  Both actors still play their roles to the hilt, and it's difficult to laugh at them coz they give credibility to the film, especially Cushing.  Cushing consistently does such a great job, and can make the silliest movie halfway decent.  You could stick Cushing in Plan 9 From Outer Space or Xanadu and he'd give the film some credibility.  One thing I just love about his Van Helsing is when he throws his crucifix into the vampire's coffin, preventing him from getting back in and sleeping.  That's so friggin' cool, and I've never seen anyone other than Cushing do that.  Cushing was a kickass Van Helsing.  Plotwise, it's really nothing new.  Dracula's resurrected by yet another Dracula worshipping schmuck called Johnny Alucard.  This ""Alucard"" thing grates on my nerves.  It was cute when Lon Chaney jr. did it, but who the hell do screenwriters think they're fooling now?  Dracula comes back and is hell bent on killing Van Helsing's great-grandson(Cushing) and enslaving his granddaughter.  Fill in the blanks for the rest.  The film seems to be attempting some kind of promotion for this band Stoneground  which is featured in the first few minutes of the film.  It seems like a promotion coz the band gets more screen time than bands tend to get in films.  Two songs practically!  The scene almost screams, ""This is Stoneground!  Buy their new album today!!"".  They never caught on though, at least not in the states.  Anyhow, I wouldn't just disregard this film.  It's got a corniness factor to it, but it's easy(for me anyhow) to just go with it.  If you don't like the approach, there's always the great gothic Dracula flicks that preceeded it to fall back on.",1153958400,3,2554,4.68018018018018
111633,3,079073608X,"The 1970s weren't an especially great time for Hammer Studios...the marketplace for horror features had become especially crowded, they would lose their American financing (and thus their most excellent production values), and the gothic horror genre, the very genre they popularized beginning in the mid to late 1950s, had become somewhat pass (this was about the time The Exorcist and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, among others, made the scene)...in an attempt to `hipsterize' themselves they brought one of their staple characters, Dracula, into the present with this release titled Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972) and the sequel The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1974).  A bold move, but one that failed miserably, especially with hardcore fans and critics alike (after `Satanic Rites' star Lee publicly stated he wouldn't be doing anymore Dracula features), as the hispterization included ditching the gothic horror for a more contemporary feel, along with throwing in a dash of comedy, effectively diluting any horror that might have found its way into the feature accidentally.  Written by Don Houghton (Shatter, The Satanic Rites of Dracula) and directed by Alan Gibson (The Satanic Rites of Dracula), the film, the seventh in the Hammer Dracula series, stars Christopher Lee (The Curse of Frankenstein, Dracula) and Peter Cushing (The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Mummy).  Also appearing is Stephanie Beacham (And Now the Screaming Starts!), Christopher Neame (Lust for a Vampire), Michael Coles (The Satanic Rites of Dracula), and one of my favorite Bond women Caroline Munro (Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me).

As the movie begins the year is 1872 and we see Dracula (Lee) and Lawrence Van Helsing (Cushing) in a death struggle atop a runaway horse carriage, which ends up smashing into a tree.  Both men bite it, no pun intended (Dracula on a broken spoke from a wheel and Van Helsing from various injuries), and Dracula's remains turn to dust, later to be collected by a mysterious figure with ginormous mutton chop sideburns.  Fast forward one hundred years into the future to swinging London...seems a group of hippies have crashed a party (the uptight squares are glowering from the sidelines), and are having themselves a real nutter of a time (both Beacham and Munro sure knew how to shake their junk)...hey, when you invite the band Stoneground to play your gig, anything can happen...anyway, the fuzz is called and the group, including Jessica Van Helsing (Beacham) sporting a hairstyle I can only describe as that of a mullet, split that tired scene.  One of their members, named Johnny Alucard (Neame)...oh bruther...comes up with a far out idea of holding a black mass ceremony in a nearby church slated for demolition, eventually suckering the rest to go along.  Well, turns out Johnny's something of a disciple of the Prince of Darkness, and initiates, unbeknownst to the rest of the group, a resurrection ritual to bring back his evil master.  Once successful, Johnny begins offering up his friends, but Dracula has only one thing in mind, that of revenge on the house of Van Helsing, and what better place to start than with Jessica?  Jessica's grandfather, Lorrimer Van Helsing (Cushing), a professor of the occult, soon realizes that which his family has fought against time and time again is back (once the mutilated bodies start piling up), and begins to sharpen the stakes and polish the crosses, but will it be enough to save himself and his granddaughter?

After watching the film last night its fairly obvious to me why there's such a general dislike for this feature, especially when comparing it to previous Dracula Hammer films...the filmmakers have literally sucked all the gothic nature from the material and replaced it with and eye towards the contemporary, which wasn't necessarily a good thing when you're talking about the contemporary 1970s...free love, hot pants, multicolored beads, unrestrained drug use, Caucasians with afros, and so on...oh, there's a bit of the gothic here and there (the scenes in the dilapidated church), but the infusion of glib comedic material within the script only served to really diminish the horror audiences had come to expect from a Hammer feature.  Here's an example of what I'm talking about as Johnny lures an unsuspecting female back to his pad for the purpose of giving her to Dracula (which seemed odd as Dracula was sequestered at the church)...as he pulls up to his flat he say to the woman, ""Come in for a bite.""...bruther...in the filmmaker's defense I can understand what they were trying to do in an effort to keep up with the times, but it just didn't play that well.  One might say ""Well, hey, at least the film's got Lee and Cushing together, so it can't be all bad""...and I'd agree, but one should know Lee is given very little screen time as his character is relegated to almost a supporting role.  Cushing comes off a bit better, but he looks a little tired, most likely due to the filmmakers having him run all over Hell and back through the streets of London accompanied by some really goofy music, pursuing his familial nemesis (do yourself a favor and get an automobile).  Caroline Munro and Stephanie Beacham provide some good jiggle action (no nekkidness, though), the latter possessing a mesmerizing rack at the time...oh, I also thought they did well enough in their roles, but, as I mentioned earlier, Ms. Beacham runs around through the entire film with a hideous mullet.  Most gave decent turns in terms of performances with perhaps the exception of Christopher Neame who was way over the top for my tastes.  Perhaps he was trying to compensate appearing with Lee and Cushing, but I felt the director should have reined him in a bit as he wasn't the star of the film.  The funniest part of the film comes when Van Helsing is trying to figure how Alucard figures into the recent spate of gruesome murders, eventually deciphering Alucard is an anagram for Dracula...gee what a brain buster that was...he actually spells the two names out on paper and then draws lines from each of the corresponding letters.  Did the filmmakers think audiences were really so dense they wouldn't have been able to figure it out without them literally spelling it out for us?  All this really did was make me suspicious of Van Helsing's occult credentials along with his intelligence (and that of the writer's).  Things do pick up within the last five minutes, when Van Helsing eventually confronts Dracula in a bloody finale.  Completists and fans of Christopher Lee and/or Peter Cushing will want to get this feature, but as far as casual viewers interested in , you might want to go with some of the earlier features like Dracula (1958) or Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966) to get a full on Hammer experience in terms of the character.

The picture, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) format, enhanced for widescreen televisions, comes across clean and sharp, and the Dolby Digital mono audio, available in English and French, comes through very clearly.  As far as extras there's not much except for a theatrical trailer and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.

  in the late 1890's dracula and his old foe van helsing are fighting on top of a run away coach in the english country. the coach wreaks and as is always the case in the hammer movies dracula dies in great form,this time inpaled by a broken wagon wheel,and van helsing also dies . as the two are put to rest a servent of draca's takes some of his ashes and his ring ,so we know that this first 5 mins. of the movie will not be the end of dracula.

  flash forward to 1972 and a young decendent of the servent of dracula gets his ""groove"" friends to join him in a rite that brings back our favorite pain in the neck. but as fate would have it one of the ""groove"" friends is the granddauter of van helsing, and enter peter cushing again as the son of the dead older van helsing, and before you can say ""can you dig it"" we have ourself a movie. nothing great but it is so much fun seeing cushing and lee together again and battleing for the who knows how many times . they have such a great on screen and i'm told off screen friendship that they make any movie they are in together that much better.

111635,3,079073608X,"This film isn't without its merits. It does feature two of the masters of the genre. Neither Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee gave the best performance they were capable of but it would be unfair to say they were uninvolved. Lee just wasn't given much to work with. This characterization of Dracula portrays the Count as nothing more than an autocrat with a bad temper. (Maybe all that party blood he drinks in this film leaves him hung-over. Who knows?). Cushing, for his part, seems to follow directions to be either obsessive or benign. When he discourses about the undead his mind stays on one track, period. For most of the rest of the film he's either gentle or wise. This is one of his least dynamic portrayals of a Van Helsing on film. The pair do have their moment though. The final confrontation between them isn't up to what they achieved with ""Horror of Dracula"" but it is memorable. If the entire film (or even most of it) had even approached the standard this scene sets it would have been close to being a classic.

Some members of the cast are reasonably strong as well. Stephanie Beacham has always been a class act (even though she's turned up in a lot of dreadful material). She gives her best effort to making the inane dialogue believable and manages to give her character some depth the writers didn't see fit to include. Michael Coles does a decent job as the police Inspector who believes Cushing even though it goes against his training. As with the parts given to Beacham, Lee (and just about everyone in the cast) the writers didn't give him a lot to work with. It's to his credit that he manages to make the character appear torn without falling into excess.

That's about where the good news ends though. Christopher Neame's performance as the Count's evil minion is so far over the top it floods into extra glasses. It's too laughable to be serious and too pathetic to be funny. The parts assigned to Marsha Hunt and Caroline Munro are never treated as anything more than sexy (but ""supposedly trendy"") vampire fodder. The dialogue they do have is awful (""it'll be a giggle"") and their delivery of it is worse. Munro's gyrations of ""agonized ecstasy"" are too silly to even be taken as ""camp"". It may not have been their fault though. Caroline Munro was a much better actress than her work here suggests (she was the only one who ever received a full contract from the studio). The others all worked again after their stints in this film (which suggests the Director, Alan Gibson, may have been the real culprit).

The soundtrack is a schizoid piece of nonsense that bounces between gothic and modern. At least, that's what it's supposed to do. The ""gothic"" track sounds like a recycled version of something that was already recycled. The attempt at ""contemporary"" music conjures images of Yanni (""Yawnee"") performing a heavy metal arrangement (a picture that should make any rational person lose their lunch if ever there was one). The wonderfully Gothic atmosphere the studio managed to charge most of their pictures with is its main victim. The series loses its thread of continuity here as well. It's pushed aside by the film's opening scenes.

Still, it's hard to really dislike this film. Even during its worst moments (and there are plenty of those) it never fails to entertain. Every time it looks as if it's about to come to the point where it should just be dismissed something happens to pull it from the abyss.

Was it their first rate production values, the incredible gothic atmosphere or the numerous classic British actors who starred in these productions like: Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and Oliver Reed? If you were a young teenage boy at the time like I was you certainly did appreciate all the above, but they weren't the reason. When you talk about Hammer horror you're talking about the most beautiful, buxom actresses of the century.

'Dracula A.D. 1972' was no different, there were four lovely ladies in this film, the two most well known being Stephanie Beacham and my personal favorite Caroline Munro.

Basic stuff here, Dracula (Christopher Lee) rises from the grave once again, this time in modern day London and seeks revenge against the ancestors of Van Helsing (Cushing and Beacham), the man who last put him in the grave.

Enjoyable, well done, but all in all predictable. And as already mentioned lots of pretty woman being terrorized by the horrible Christopher Lee to keep the young boys interested.",1129420800,7,1169,4.9238578680203045

Even though Dracula's cape would make him bang up to date walking down seventies Carnaby Street, the Count decides to delegate his chicanery to, you guessed it, another rubbish Butler. Taking after his master, this groovy servant of the Lord of Darkness (TM) decides to take a bath with his clothes on, a Dracula family tradition it seems.

Later, Dracula confronts a descendant of his old nemesis, Van Helsing. ""Do you think you can defeat me, I who have commanded armies?"" he snarls. Since you can't even command a bloody butler for hundreds of years, matey, I'd say that's a certified yes.",1129420800,,930,4.705521472392638

What I like about it is the Dracula puts the bite on a major male character making him an acolyte, who in turns puts the bite on another male character (whom the vampire, Johnny doesn't much care for.)  Victorian mores aside, the homoerotic scheme of this film is interesting.  That could possibly explain the pan for this film as opposed to TTBOD.

This is pure camp however.  Enjoy in the Hammer canon.  Bring on Twins of Evil and ""Vampire Circus"" a film that was truly vilified...and one of the best!

A group of friends, bored with their lives, decide that performing a black mass ritual that will literally raise Hell sounds like a fun new way to get kicks, and just happen to resurrect a thoroughly pissed-off Count Dracula in the process. That's the premise of both movies, and both movies carry it off nicely.

""Dracula A.D. 1972"" admittedly contains some awkward moments, most notably the absurd and insulting scene in which the brilliant Prof. Van Helsing has to write the name 'Alucard' down on paper and study it before making the all-too-terribly-obvious connection to his family's arch-nemesis, but these are nit-picks. It's a beautifully-photographed, slickly-produced and generally well-acted piece, featuring both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee at the height of their game. The '70s pop soundtrack, much-maligned, is actually quite effective and suits the movie. It's fast-paced, entertaining fun, and isn't that all any genre film really needs to be?

It starts - set in past - with a wild galloping fight between Cushing and Lee atop a runaway carrage, ending with Lee getting a stake through the heart from a broke carriage wheel spoke.
Cut to the very modern and hip swinging 70s.  Very mod and bored rock and rollers summon Dracula and he is off at a merry clip, showing it is too hard to teach an old dog new tricks!

It blends familiar gothic elements with a ""modern"" setting.  After a pulse-pounding prologue, showing the Victorian-era Dracula impaled on a broken carriage wheel, the action fast-forwards 100 years to 1972.  Bored with sex, drugs, and rock n' roll, a motley crew of aging British hippies resurrect Dracula in a de-sanctified church.  Dracula decides to settle old debts by taking Van Helsing's granddaughter as his bloody bride.  This is a fine opportunity to see legendary Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee perpetuate their long running battle of good vs. evil.  Mist-shrouded scenes of Dracula in the ruins of the profaned church are visually effective.  Lee's towering, menacing presence in the flowing black cape adds to the fun.  His feral lust for the blood of young women is frankly sexual.  Instead of typical Hammer heaving bosoms in Victorian bodices, we have substantial cleavage in '70s gauche courtesy of Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Munro, et al.  Sex and the vampire are never far apart, regardless of the era.  The penetration is of the fangs in the neck variety, but we get the idea.  Peter Cushing looks emaciated and gaunt.  As Van Helsing, he uses superior cunning to foil Dracula's supernatural power.  Their climactic confrontation recalls the showdown from ""Horror of Dracula.""  Some groaning humor lightens the mood.  Johnny Alucard is Dracula's mod disciple.  His name spelled backwards is significant.  A street scene focuses briefly on a restaurant called ""London Steak House.""

111669,3,079073608X,"""Dracula A.D. 1972,"" starring Christopher Lee as the titular vampire, is one bizarre film. It starts with a prologue set in the 1800s: Lee's Dracula is shown in battle with his nemesis Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). As the title indicates, the main body of the film brings Dracula into the 1970s, where he battles Van Helsing's descendant (also played by Cushing). Also along for the horror is a young Stephanie Beacham as the second Van Helsing's lovely granddaughter.
The film tries to blend traditional vampiric horror with 70s style youth culture: thus the elements of sex (discretely), drugs, and rock 'n' roll permeate the film. To early 21st century viewers, the swingin' music, outrageous mod clothes, hairdos, and wannabe hip slang (""Weird, man. Way out"") of the young cast may come off as more campy than anything else, but it does make the film fun.
Lee is compelling as Dracula: articulate and elegant, yet feral. Unfortunately, his screen time is sparse; his amounts to little more than a small supporting role. The real star of the film is Cushing as the 20th century Van Helsing. The classy Cushing projects real intelligence and ability as his character. He brings total conviction to every scene, and has solid chemistry with Beacham (although I think his hands come a little too close to her bosom in a couple of scenes--watch it, ""Grandpa""!).

111681,3,079073608X,"Toward the end of Hammer Films' reign as THE horror movie studio, they decided to transport the Dracula character into the modern era. This was the first of two films where Dracula stalked the Swingin' Seventies.
The best part of this film, sadly, is the dynamic opening sequence in which we bid farewell to the psuedo-Victorian age of the old Hammer Dracula--a battle between a Van Helsing and the Count on top of an out-of-control carriage. While there are occassional glimmers of similar excitement later in the film, this is as good as it gets. Dracula's death scene is also pretty nifty, even if he is (once again) dispatched almost as much by accident as by the actions of the hero.
The biggest flaw are the thirty-year-olds that are cast as teenagers. Making matters worse, they aren't particularly good actors to begin with, so their lack of youth becomes even more distracting as the film unfolds.
The only real bright spot in the flick is Peter Cushing who portrays a modern day decendent of his original Van Helsing character--sort of. There are some weird continuity issues that were probably invisible back when the film was released, but if one is anal (like me) and watches ""Horror of Dracula"" in close order to watching this one (like I did), the quirk screams out at you. Maybe there are really TWO Hammer Dracula storylines embodied in this series, rather like what happened with the Frankenstein one? (That could certainly explain the sadistic side that Dracula starting showing when Hammer Films entered the Seventies.)
But, that's really a nitpick that has little impact on the overall film.
It's a fact that Cushing delivers the only noteworthy performance here, with even the much-lauded Christopher Lee coming across as tired and slightly bored in the few scenes he appears in. The biggest strike against Cushing in this flick is a problem with the script; he is touted as a brilliant scholar and researcher, yet he has to work entirely too hard to figure out that the mysterious Johnny Alucard's last name is DRACULA spelled backwards! (Maybe it
It's an unfortunate fact that there are few truly chilling moments in this flick. The Satanic rite in the church where Dracula is returned to life isn't bad--although it would probably have been stronger if the actors involved had been better and had been a little closer in age to the teens they were portraying--and Van Helsing's confrontation with Johnny Alucard is also appropriately suspenseful, but that's about it. Even the final confrontation between Dracula and Van Helsing is rather ""eh.""
This is the weakest entry in the Hammer Films Dracula series, with Peter Cushing earning it a full extra star all by himself. View it primarily for the prologue and as a stage-setter for the far superior ""The Satanic Rites of Dracula"" (aka ""Dracula and His Vampire Bride"").",1013126400,,2843,4.912681912681912
