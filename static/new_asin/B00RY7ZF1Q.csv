8696279,1,B00RY7ZF1Q,"In 2012 propaganda use against Americans became legal, this is one of the examples of how it's done.  Matthew Vandyke was a mercenary trying to launch his own mecr company, with some back up he did just that;

"" Kony 2012-Style PR Stunt To Sell War On Syria

Documentary to be produced by mercenary who fought with NATO-backed Libyan rebels""

Piece by Paul Joseph Watson from 2012 does it best, and that's even before Vandyke graduated to Syria, got his film production and mercenary ""consulting"" firm that actually trains militants.

State sponsored criminality, enjoy your piece of the pie.",1472947200,,592,4.9393939393939394
8696280,5,B00RY7ZF1Q,I saw this on Netflix. I think it was a good documentary. It make you aware of what is currently happening some other places. Also motivate a person to read more into history and current events. As it is don't have any opinion on Gaddafi besides he was a dictator overthrown by the revolutionary group. So it is interesting to watch.,1471824000,,333,4.475409836065574
8696281,5,B00RY7ZF1Q,"I did not know anything about the film when it started, other than he was involved with the rebels in Libya. When it opened I thought this was one of those nuts who is into carrying knives to protect himself from the U.S. government, or some other group he perceives as out to take away his liberties. It was nothing like that at all. The story is fascinating and thrown into the mix is is compulsive obsessive behavior regarding several things (hand washing, sugar, germs).  One of the reviews I read elsewhere after seeing the film complained that the movie focused on him to much. The movie is about his life and is filmed by him so of course it is focused on him.",1454198400,,667,4.379032258064516

8696284,5,B00RY7ZF1Q,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.  VanDyke really put himself out there, warts and all. We see the transformation from a  bratty kid, brattier adolescent to a dependent, self-conscious, young man lacking in self-esteem and self-confidence,  then a slightly-self-indulgent trip to see the world he read about in books. Finally, the metamorphosis is complete. A man emerges unlike any of the previous stages.  VanDyke is committed to friends their needs.  The more VanDyke is exposed to the suffering and degradation of fellow humanity, the more he is motivated to help alleviate that suffering, to help them find their way to independence and self-determination.  Resoluteness of purpose overcomes personal fears, and VanDykes meets the challenges with confidence and passion.",1436745600,,780,5.6239316239316235
8696285,4,B00RY7ZF1Q,"""Point and Shoot"" (2014 release; 83 min.) is a documentary about Matthew Vandyke, a 20-something guy who, having lived a sheltered life (only child in a well-to-do family), decides to do something about it and goes on a 3 year bike journey across much of Southern Europe and Northern Africa. Along the way he meets and befriends a guy from Libya, and the two develop a strong bond. At the end of 2010, Matt returns home to Baltimore, much to the relief of his girlfriend Lauren, who cannot believe how much Matt has matured (for the better). Then, just 2 months later, the Arab Spring explodes, including in Libya. Matt decides that he cannot stand idle so he returns to Libya to take up the fight alongside his friends against Omar Gaddafi. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a very heavy Matt Vandyke-centric documentary. As we get to know him, including video clips from his youth, you can't help but wonder how in the world this guy gets along into his mid-20s without doing anything for himself. But at least he seems to realize that himself as well, reason that he decides to take a ""crash course in manhood"" (fueled by watching lots of TV and playing lots of video games). The first 30 min. of the documentary focuses mostly on that and the subsequent 3 year/35,000 mi. motorcycle journey (at no point is the question raised how he pays for all this--I suppose his well-to-do family?). The remainder of the documentary focuses on his stint in Libya alongside the rebels, and makes for much more interesting viewing. If nothing else, it is fascinating to see archive footage of what Libya was like in those days, and the images are far more nuanced that whatever footage we saw from US TV news. Second, as conflicted as I am about Vandyke, who seems mostly interested in himself, you can't help but at the same time also give him kudos for doing what he did, going to a war zone to fight alongside his Libyan friends against a brutal dictator. Beware, there are a number of very brutal scenes that may shock some viewers. Finally, there is a nice instrumental score by James Boxter, and for whatever reason the National also contributed several tracks (including Mistaken for Strangers, and Hard to Find).

""Point and Shoot"" opened without any pre-release buzz or advertising on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati in early December. I figured this would not play for long (I was right: only one week), so I went to see it right away, and at the early evening screening where I saw this at, I got a private screening (as in: I was literally the only person in the theater). This isn't the greatest of documentaries, but I'd still suggest you check it out, be it in the theater or eventually on Amazon Instant Video or DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions about ""Point and Shoot"".",1422489600,7,2902,4.622093023255814
