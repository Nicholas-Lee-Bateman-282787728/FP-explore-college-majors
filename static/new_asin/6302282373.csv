For those who have seen Bronsons other foreign films you know they have a different, more 'artsy' feel to them.  Nonetheless, it is a fine production with a great performance by Bronson in his prime.  Great story and acting but maybe hard to catch it all in one viewing. The tape I watched was recorded in the substandard LP mode so picture and sound were disappointing to say the least.  I've read the DVD was no better.

Great period on location French settings and interiors. Together with Rider on the Rain this is the vastly superior pre-Death Wish period Bronson which features him with Alain Delon, and Brigitte Fossey. Unjustly overlooked film. Algerian war vet Delon gets roped into breaking into a vault and Bronson gets wise to it. Taut direction and good characterizations with wonderfully minimalist dialogue, and that great trick with the coins...",996710400,3,568,5.184782608695652
