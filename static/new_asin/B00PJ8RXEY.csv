It begins in a theater. An actor speaks, he is interrupted by a man in a box. Who is this braggart? Cyrano orders quiet! The actor is ordered off the stage. Cyrano pays for a refund. He is sensitive about his nose. Will no one put him in his place asks a nobleman? There is a duel. People watch, then cheer the winner. Cyrano is warned, his opponent is the nephew of the Cardinal. Cyrano is lonely. He loves his cousin Roxanne but is afraid of being rejected. A servant brings him a message from a Lady. A pastry cook asks for Cyranos protection. Theres no lights at night. Cyrano defends himself against many in a dark night. The next morning Cyrano meets Roxanne in the pastry shop. She tells him of her love for a man in the Guards and asks Cyrano to care for this Baron from Normandy. The other Guardsmen congratulate him. The Cardinal is upset by the deaths of eight men, a violation of his ban on dueling.

The Cardinal promotes his nephew. He would prefer Cyrano to write poetry than fight duels. Antoine offers a deal to Cyrano. He is too proud to accept. Why go about making enemies? A new member is warned but he provoked Cyrano! Cyrano speaks to him in private, he apologizes. Christian is afraid to speak to Roxanne, Cyrano offers to help him with his speech. Roxanne speaks to Cyrano about Christians poetry. That evening Christian speaks to Roxanne, she expects fancy speech. Cyrano prompts Christians speech, then speaks for him. He asks for a kiss. Cyrano consoles himself. An old priest brings a letter asking for a private marriage that night. Cyrano guards the door against an intruder to allow the marriage. Christians regiment is ordered to leave that night to fight the Spanish (who then owned the Netherlands). At the front they are ordered to hold out against superior forces. Cyrano writes a letter to Roxanne.

A carriage arrives, Roxanne is there, so too the pastry cook with food. Roxanne talks to Christian, who tells Cyrano about this. Roxanne will be told the truth. The Captain sends Christian to scout the enemy. A shot announces the enemys advance, Christian is wounded and dies! Then the enemy advances over the French parapet. There is hand-to-hand fighting. The French troops return to win the battle of Arras. Later Cyrano continues to attack the nobility with his satires. Roxanne is warned of a plot against Cyrano. A horse drawn wagon runs him down! Instead of resting Cyrano goes to visit Roxanne to tell her the news. Roxanne gives him a letter to read (the last letter from Christian). She realizes the truth now. Cyrano struggles to his feet, he fights an invisible foe. Then he falls.

This is a very sentimental movie based on the 19th century play by Edmond Rostand. It seems based on an obscure individual from the 17th century France. The story of unrequited love must have been popular then. Is it at all realistic for the 20th century? I think Hollywood went for costume dramas at this time to avoid any controversy in subject matter. It served as a distraction from current events. Is this play still performed for paying customers?",1459555200,,3116,4.6703096539162114
