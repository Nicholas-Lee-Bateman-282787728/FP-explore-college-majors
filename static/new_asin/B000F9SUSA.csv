8119448,1,B000F9SUSA,"These are obviously some sort of student VIDEOS (NOT FILMS)  I won't even comment on the AWFUL performances given  by the people who appeared in these projects. (You can't even call them actors). I would guess that anyone who reviewed this collection with positive feedback was involved in it's production.  On some level they should be embarrassed and quite frankly ashamed.  If you want to make home videos and give them to your friends for a laugh, please do so. Just don't subject the general public to viewing them and don't solicit money for it.  Feel free to laugh at me for getting my money, I'm an idiot who ran out of things to watch so I took a chance.  I certainly couldn't sleep at night without posting a warning to others who might want to also take that risk.  While I can't say anything good about this collection, I will give well wishes to those who were involved.  It would appear some of you have an interest in making movies and I wouldn't want to be a dream killer. However I recommend none of you ever put this on a resume and that you pull it from the shelves.  Donate the dvd's to film schools so they can show new students what not to do in order to have a career in the industry.  Lastly....Dear Amazon,  Please stop stocking items like this, remove the temptation for anyone who might get stuck with owning others home movies.  Free enterprise is no excuse to sacrifice your reputation.  In my opinion, the dollar you make today...will be the two dollars you lose tomorrow!",1418428800,,1502,4.498154981549815

8119452,4,B000F9SUSA,"The Crazed Killers DVD offers creative horror movies. An out of the box way of thinking regarding the stories. It is great to see new faces and new ideas on my TV at home. You can't beat the price, one heck of a deal for 6 movies.",1157414400,3,230,3.9148936170212765
8119453,4,B000F9SUSA,"The tales in CRAZED KILLERS run the gamut from very cheesy drive-in-movie fillers, to thought-provoking, interesting films.  Of the six in the set, three stand above the rest:  ""Toe Tags"" for its interesting plot; ""Serial Killer"" for both its story line and its almost full-porn, which would appeal to some viewers; and ""The Traveler"" (the BEST of the lot) for its complete package of scenery, special effects, and finely crafted story line.  Of all six films, this one comes closest to being a real movie -- despite its occasional flaws.  While its opening scenes are slower-paced than those in the other five films, the positive side is that the viewer comes to know the characters well enough that the horror becomes all the more terrifying once it begins.",1149120000,10,759,4.90625
8119454,5,B000F9SUSA,"Get this DVD to check out the indie movie DAY OF THE AX. If you dig movies like the TEXAS CHAINSAW and DEVIL'S REJECTS, then you'll enjoy this indie version.  Very cool...",1147910400,4,171,4.34375
