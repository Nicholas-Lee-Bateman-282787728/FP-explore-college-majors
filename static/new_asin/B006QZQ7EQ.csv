Unfortunately, I was a little let down by this movie. It may be that I over hyped it in my mind, or that it just can't quite measure up to its predecessors. The first Press Start movie was an epic adventure movie, while this one is a buddy movie. I can see how they had to change the genre a bit, otherwise it would just be the same movie over again, but at the same time, I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as the first movie.

This movie is still good and humorous, but I suggest checking out the first move and the cartoon before this one. One other thing I should mention is that the makers of the movie say you don't need to see the cartoon in order to enjoy this second movie, but I disagree. I think a viewer would be too confused about what happened between the two movies to lead up to the second.

In case you are wondering the chronological order would be to watch, here it is:
1. Season 1 of the cartoon
2. The first movie
3. Seasons 2 and 3 of the cartoon
4. The second movie",1358294400,,1099,4.032110091743119
