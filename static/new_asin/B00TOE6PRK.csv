Since the Backstage Workout isn't available yet to purchase, I'm hoping that my review will help those who are interested in purchasing it once it's available on Amazon or if you want to purchase it from the BB website, which I did.

~~  BACKSTAGE WORKOUT ~~

The Backstage Workout is a must-have if you love her Classic/Total Body DVD!  I have all ten of the BB DVDs, and this one reminds me the most of the Classic ones in terms of how its structured.

There is a Play All option on the main menu, or you can choose individual segments to play, one at a time. (You cant select more than one to string them together.)

There are also three audio options:  play the workout with music and Mary Helens voice, play just with Mary Helens voice, and play just with music.

It is an all-mat workout, so all you need is a mat to do this and perhaps a small towel, which Mary Helen uses in a few places under her knees when shes on all fours.

Most of the exercises are done in four sets of eight reps, as Mary Helen usually does in her workouts, but there are some exercises where you do more or less than the four sets.

Mary Helen is in a beautiful purple leotard against a white backdrop with some palm plants as color.  The music is her standard piano classical music, which I find so soothing.

The audio on this echoes a bit, as it has in some of her other more-recent workouts.  Truth be told, though, I stopped noticing it since I was working so hard in the first section!

The segments are:

 Arabesque Extensions  For this segment, youll be on all fours, but will be balancing on one side since youll be using one arm and leg to do various leg extensions.  This is one of the hardest for me since it requires a lot of balance!

 Ballerina Arms  Youll start by doing triceps dips.  From there, she has you lay on your stomach and do a variation of what she usually calls her Ballerina Push-Backs.  I really felt my arms in new ways!

 Abs with Core Twist  Starts with two sets of 12 reps of a crunch-type move, using your arms.  Then youll go into oblique twists.

 Ballerina Legs:  Inner Thighs  These are done on your stomach, and she has you moving your legs outwards.  This was such a different variation on her inner thigh lifts, and they really burned in a good way!

 Staggered Bridge:  Legs, Butt, and Core  Youll be doing bridge exercises, but with your legs staggered, one in front of the other.

 Elongating Stretch  Up until this point, the other sections take up the first 40 minutes of this workout.  The Elogating Stretch is 20 minutes long.

Throughout the workout, Mary Helen takes her usual stretch breaks, but she mentions a few times that they are quicker than they usually are since well do the longer stretch at the end of the workout.

Speaking of the stretch segment, I'm still a bit disappointed that it wasn't an add-on as it was on the Ballet Baby DVDs.  I would rather have a full 60 minutes of toning exercises, followed by a bonus 20-minute stretch.  That being said, the 20 minutes of stretch goes by quickly. I usually hate stretching on its own, which is part of why I love Ballet Beautiful (because it incorporates stretching between sets), but this segment is really pleasant, and I actually enjoy doing it.

The core segment is also especially tough.  This is the first BB workout Ive done that has left me sore deep in my core muscles the day after I do it.

Overall, I really love the Backstage Workout!  If you love her Classic/Total Body DVD, you'll love this one, too!

~~ SWAN ARMS CARDIO ~~

*  I posted the following review a year ago when<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Swan-Arms-Cardio/dp/B00S02R1G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Swan Arms Cardio</a>first came out, but am including it here again.

I have all of Mary Helen's DVDs (even her four Ballet Baby ones, even though I'm not expecting! :-)), and she's one of my favorite workout instructors. Not only do I adore her personality, but whenever I'm consistent about doing Ballet Beautiful workouts, I see huge differences in my posture and also in my muscle tone. A few years ago, I just alternated her two Classic/Total Body and Body Blasts DVDs for three weeks, and really tightened up. More recently, I've been doing Ballet Beautiful for the last two weeks, and it's really helping me lose some thigh girth that I gained doing one of Jillian Michaels' programs. I was really excited to get this new workout and do like it and am glad I bought it, but I do prefer her other eight DVDs a bit more.

If you do the entire workout, it comes in at just under 58 minutes long, but you also have the option of dividing it up into shorter workouts.

From the main menu, you have several options:

* Play All -- 58 minutes long, including the Elongated Stretch segment

* Standing Cardio: Legs, Arms, and Core -- about 30 minutes

* Mat Work: Abs, Thighs, and Butt -- about 23 minutes long

* Elongated Stretch -- 7 minutes

* Audio Options -- gives you the options to play the workout with Mary Helen and music, just with the music, or just with Mary Helen

This is filmed in an all-white room that looks a bit different from her previous backdrops in that you can see large windows and the skyline behind Mary Helen. I wish they had used the space from the Ballet Baby series since that backdrop and the colorful flowers were so soothing in those four workouts; it was more interesting to look at. I usually enjoy the basic backdrop in the BB workouts, but in the Mat Work segment, Mary Helen is lying down on an all-white floor against an all-white wall in a white leotard, and the aesthetic of it felt a bit stark and not that soothing to me.

At the very beginning of the workout, Mary Helen gives a few pointers about form and posture, which is a nice reminder.

The Standing Cardio section includes some plie variations at the start, but is mostly standing leg lifts to the front and back and tendu work, all of which include swan arms motions. For each exercise, you'll do two sets of eight repetitions. This got my heart rate up nicely, and wasn't quite as challenging as the cardio segments on Ballet Beautiful: Cardio Fat Burn and Ballet Beautiful: Sculpt & Burn Cardio Blast. For that reason, this would probably be a good DVD to start with if you need to work up to Cardio Fat Burn or Sculpt & Burn Cardio Blast. Also, there isn't jumping in the cardio segment; you have one leg on the ground at all times, so it's a more low-impact and quieter workout to do if you're worried about noise or about it being too high impact.

The leg work is the Standing Cardio half is also more straightforward on this workout than it is on Cardio Fact Burn and Sculpt & Burn; since I don't have any ballet training (unless, of course, you count those lessons I took when I was four :-) ), I had a hard time keeping up with the cardio segments on those other two DVDs the first few times I did them, whereas the Standing Cardio segment on this DVD is easier in terms of its choreography and pacing. Another nice benefit of this Standing Cardio section is that a lot of the moves are done on one leg, so it's an excellent way to work on your balance and on strengthening your core. This whole section also really works the legs and glutes since you're doing a lot of work where you extend one leg in back of you.

The Mat Work segment opens with about ten minutes of C-curve work, and uses your arms a bit more than the ab work in her previous workouts. After working abs, Mary Helen moves into outer thigh lifts and small leg circles. There really wasn't much targeted glute work in this section at all (despite the sub-title of this set), which surprised me. I love her inner and outer thigh and glute work, so really wish that there was more outer thigh work and at least a bit of inner thigh work. There also wasn't anything that directly targeted the glutes; the outer thigh lifts hit the glutes a bit, but not as much as I was hoping there would be. In my mind, Mary Helen really excels in her mat work for the legs; even though the title of this workout makes it clear that the focus will be on standing cardio, I still wish that there had been more than just ten or so minutes of this workout devoted to leg floorwork.

The Elongated Stretch clocks in at seven minutes long, and it's part of the 58 total minutes of the workout. This nice, long stretch was a good treat, and is a nice addition to the BB model. Usually, Mary Helen stretches quite a bit between exercise sets (which is great), but doesn't include a longer stretch like she does here. On her Ballet Baby workouts, she includes longer stretch segments, which I love, but this was nicer in that the slightly shorter length (only seven minutes, compared to ten or fifteen on her Ballet Baby DVDs) means that I'm less likely to skip the end stretch. I hope that future DVDs include a longer stretch like this. It's the ""Baby Bear"" perfect length -- not too long, not too short, but rather just right.

While I enjoyed doing this for the first time, I kept feeling a bit disappointed in that the segments didn't feel ""fresh"" to me. I keep trying to figure out why that is, and think it's because this past week I splurged on a month of Ballet Beautiful's streaming workouts since they were on sale for half price, and have been so happy with the diversity of those shorter segments. I wish that she had brought some more of that creativity into this new DVD. The focus on using swan arms throughout each exercise was unique, but many of the exercises themselves didn't feel as fun to do. I can't quite put my finger on why I'm not liking this one as much as her previous DVDs . . . but that's all I can think of.

For some reason, the sound quality on this is also a bit off; Mary Helen's voice echoes, and it was a bit distracting at first. Once I got into the workout, I didn't notice it as much, but it's a shame that they didn't catch this during the production.

As a random side note, it seems like Mary Helen might have filmed this before she had her baby since she seems to have more of her pre-pregnancy look. She always looks amazing, though, but I thought that this was interesting.

As I mentioned at the start of my review, the Ballet Beautiful workouts are fantastic at shaping your muscles into long, lean lines. Many of the Victoria's Secret Angels train with her, and so does Alexa Chung. I am an hourglass shape who bulks up really easily in the thighs, and whenever I consistently use my BB DVDs, I slim up and look leaner. My pants fit more loosely, and my muscles look more defined. Her workouts are tough, but you will see results when doing them, even if you don't add in much cardio.

Overall, I'm glad I bought this workout and know I'll use it, but I'm not sure that it will get as much use in my repertoire as her other DVDs. I will also update my review when I do this workout again since it may grow on me more when I do it a second time. If you're new to Ballet Beautiful, I'd suggest starting with her first two DVDs, Ballet Beautiful: Total Body Workout and Ballet Beautiful: Body Blast. I have about 300 workout DVDs in my collection, and those two are some of my most frequently used DVDs since they're so fantastic.",1456012800,6,11407,4.419216061185469
