8109598,5,B000EGZ7NU,"This advanced tutorial is great for those knowledgable students who know modes and chords and want to develop their ears.
Yes not all the camera angles are given, you have to be able to do some of the work yourself.
Music is difficult and takes time to develop.
Go through this and you will be better at 2 hand chord voicings and your ears will be able to hear them.",1403222400,,366,4.242857142857143
8109599,1,B000EGZ7NU,"If would have been much better with overhead shots of keyboard. Would have helped if we know what she was playing.  I needed an DVD of chord voicing and would have appreciated if we had been presented with more information.
This is not for first timers.  I guess its money that  could have been better off else where.",1246924800,2,317,4.431034482758621
8109600,5,B000EGZ7NU,"A comprehensive DVD on chord voicings. Good for those who self-learn piano like me. I agree with the other review that the angle is kinda hard to see, but it's not that horrible. You can still understand and see what she's playing. It's exactly what I needed.",1200441600,,259,4.531914893617022
