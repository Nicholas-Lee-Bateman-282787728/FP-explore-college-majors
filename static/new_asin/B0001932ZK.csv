1980335,3,B0001932ZK,"I bought this DVD because I'm a huge Michael Keaton fan.  While he and Michael Caine are great in the movie, this just seems to be another ho-hum crime thriller.  The acting is good, the story is okay, I don't think you ever really find yourself overly rooting for the bad guy.  If it wasn't for the two main stars, you probably wouldn't watch.",1082764800,5,344,4.34375
1980336,5,B0001932ZK,"Thoroughly enjoyable film, great soundtrack, locations and story.
Miichael Keaton is well-cast as a mild-mannered excecutive whose life is sent into turmoil when he goes to investigate shady deals being made through his company. Michael Caine as always is superb and really has fun with his role as Movie Star Jake Mellows. The supporting cast is great and the plot is well written.
Note: Watch the featurette after you see the film.",1081814400,19,433,5.027777777777778

1980390,4,B0001932ZK,"A relatively few scenes from Michael Caine add a bit of inebriated class to this routine but entertaining thriller. Michael Keaton handles the lead well, if not with flair, and a number of supporting roles are well done. All about a banker who gets caught up in a not entirely clear scam, which seems, as a sideline, to have young woman raped, for no apparent reason except to provide some not very blatant sex to the proceedings, and is framed for murder. Russian gangsters, corrupt police, a beautiful, more or less innocent, young employee of the chief gangster, and assorted others make for a somewhat confusing but decent film. Pleasant viewing when nothing really good is available.",1321401600,,688,4.888888888888889
1980391,1,B0001932ZK,"Five stars for Michael Keaton (I could watch that man read the PHONE book).  The movie however, STUNK.

There are sooo many plot holes and oddities in this movie (the girl lying ""dead"" in bed is blinking, no blood on the white sheets even though she's massacred), Keaton's character is somehow easily able to go from area to area without any transportation. He's able to send email without logging into any email service.  It takes him 5 minutes to padlock a woman in a caged room and then is able to get her out of there in 2 seconds (and HOW did he get the key?).  The whole movie is like that -- where you watch it and go, ""WAIT a minute. You can't DO that!""",1320969600,2,661,4.222222222222222
1980412,3,B0001932ZK,"I am a fan of both Michael Cain and Michael Keaton (never been a better Batman), but this isn't one of their better works. I'm not a movie critic by along shot so you won't get any of the tech-language here, just an honest like or dislike opinion.",1315267200,,247,4.166666666666667
1980413,2,B0001932ZK,"This is now the third Anglo-French film of the B-budget category that I've picked out of the barrel. And I'm now throughly convinced the French are completely insane. I have no idea how this country produced Catherine Deneuve and Genevieve Bujold, none.

The last 10-15 years have showcased singularly unappealing, unbelievable and wholly unattractive female lead actresses. I now believe this is intentional - the same way some dog owners pick canines that are universally ugly and then espouse that you must see beyond the superficial and see the ""inner"" beauty.

And in most instances I agree. But action films, and movies in general, require some degree of superficiality - I mean, c'mon, they're MOVIES. These aren't documentaries.

But oh no, not the French, beaut&eacute; int&eacute;rieure est la vraie beaut&eacute;.

The plot is, as many reviewers have already noted, formulaic and pedestrian. But I give kudos to Keaton for doing his best with a limited vehicle. And Michael Caine? Not even sure poor Michael Caine was even in this production. Too bad too, because it's his limited and pitch perfect performance that was most enjoyable.

However, the choice for lead actress - yikes. Suffice to say they could've used the aforementioned ugly mutt to fill in her role, making this 'Turner & Hooch The Sequel'. And you know what - it might've worked. And how sad is that?

If this were released in 1991 - I believe it would've been pretty good and not destined as a direct-to-video product. As it was 2003...well... (shrug)",1295827200,,1531,5.0078740157480315
1980414,5,B0001932ZK,"Sid recently went against his better judgement and decided it would be ok for Santa to join Sunday golf. Yeah, not really. On the way to the first tee the first C was pretty much yelled about one of the players. Fantastic you know it's gonna be a great day. Shockingly, the first 5 holes went without incident. Then we came to the sixth hole.

After being explicitly told to fight his true nature to maintain a 4:1 ratio of shots hit to shots counted and just hit one shot and move on, Santa shanked a 5 iron into the sand. Sid was on the other side of the fairway and did  not see Santa drop another ball and hit a shot into a mud pit hazzard. Upon pulling the cart to where Santa stood, we saw a yellow rope. Lost on Santa, this means DO NOT FREAKING GO HERE. Then we saw this buffoon walking in the mud with what looked like mud covered shoes. Sid said ""what are you doing?"" ""My shoes!"" Santa said, pointing to two gashes in the mud. Then the realization came that this mess of a human stepped in the mud, stepped out and his shoes stayed behind. Looking on in amazement, Santa was seen digging with his hands through hot wet smelly mud to retrieve sweet nike golf shoes. However, while digging, Santa started sinking through mud that had been cultivated from heavy rain recently and 2 weeks of 90+ degree weather. As he sank in to almost his knee Santa screamed out ""ITS'S QUICKSAND!"" Sid replied ""They're just f**king shoes get out of there!"" But no, Santa finally got out and got the shoes. He then put them back on, went to the sand trap and hit the shot he should of in the first place. And with muddy shoes, socks, and legs, Santa played at his jolly worst for the final 12 holes.

I guess you could look at this story 2 ways. Was it an abosolutely stupid thing to do? Yes yes. But, if he has nothing else, Santa has resolve. Who else would have played 12 more holes of golf after an incident like that? The oaf deserves credit for unflinching determination to keep going on no matter how many times he trips himself up. You wouldn't be the same without your clumsiness in every aspect of being, Zap Rogdower, and Sid applaudes your ability to keep us laughing, surprised, and constantly amazed after all these years.",1277769600,,2226,4.320574162679426
1980415,3,B0001932ZK,"I watched this movie once and then placed it among those DVDs, which I probably will never watch again. The enhanced 1.85:1 picture is very good and has contributed to my three-star rating.",1275782400,,189,4.757575757575758
1980416,2,B0001932ZK,"The movie itself? Not so good. Its a pretty predictable thriller that tends to drag itself on an on. While I will admit there are some interesting scenes, the movie really doesn't pick up  until the very end when the music kicks in for the credits. Its just so haunting. Unfortunatly, I cannot say the same for the rest of the movie. To make a long story short, my opinion is if you do happen to decide to pick this movie up, don't expect greatness. Although Michael Keaton and Cane aren't bad in and of themselves, the rest of the movie is pure...well I leave the rest of the sentance up to you to decide.",1201219200,2,606,4.269565217391304
1980417,5,B0001932ZK,"This was a sleeper, but I went on to discover that this was an excellent movie.  Although Michael Keaton has perfoprmed better in other roles, this was a good reversal of a drama role from his standard comedy.  Don't take that wrong, he is a great actor, something that these other so called actors could strive for in their performances.",1184544000,2,338,4.616666666666666
1980418,3,B0001932ZK,"QUICKSAND is a formulaic, by the numbers thriller set in the world of corporate money laundering.  Michael Keaton plays Martin Raike, a bank executive who goes to France to investigate the possibility of money laundering there.  He meets a lovely CEO (Judith Godreche), who also introduces him to a has been action star (the ubiquitous Michael Caine).  It isn't too long, though, that Keaton is set up to take the fall as the assassin of the crooked chief of police, and is on the run to prove his innocence.  While the movie is certainly not a bad one, it would have been much better if there had been more of Caine in his delightful role as a has been actor.  His scenes with Keaton are the only true energy in the picture and had there been more, QUICKSAND could have been a far more enjoyable film.",1138665600,3,802,4.465753424657534
1980419,2,B0001932ZK,"I really wanted to enjoy this crime thriller because it starred two of my favorite actors, Michael Keaton and Michael Kaine, but as much as I tried to be objective, this one didn't shine for me.  The story never came together well because the directing and editing was simply awful.  Even the star power of Keaton and Kaine couldn't overcome the lousy directing.  The scenes were chopped and stapled together with impunity.

This film had the potential to be a success.  It had a reasonably well written script and the right actors to play the parts.  It's a shame it didn't turn out that way.  I own the DVD, but it's one I won't be watching again any time soon.",1134777600,4,663,4.475
1980420,4,B0001932ZK,"It seems that not alot of people have watched this little gem of a film, by the number of reviews that it has...but I have to say, that with the likes of Michael Keaton and Michael Caine, this film delivered a great action movie!!!  The script was in a nice tight package, and the actors took the parts well.  It was one of those films that made me wonder what was going to happen next.

1980421,4,B0001932ZK,QUICKSAND is a terrific action drama that wears a good script well acted by a strong cast headed by Michael Keaton and Michael Caine and well directed by fully in-control Director John Mackenzie.  The topic of money laundering is particularly timely at this point in our history so gathering information about the ins and outs of this type of scam is apropos.  Michael Keaton is an obsessive-compulsive American investigator sent to France in his role as investigator and ends up being setup as an accused assassin.  He is forced into escape and into hiding until he uncovers the truth about the company under investigation (actually a porn industry) and with the help of a has-been actor (played superlatively by Michael Caine) finds a way out.  The mechanisms for this good guy-bad guy chase and intrigue make for edge-of-the seat suspense.  Not a great movie but certainly one  of the better intrigue films greatly enhanced by a strong cast of supporting actors in excellent cameo roles. Recommended.,1086480000,16,1003,5.0120481927710845
