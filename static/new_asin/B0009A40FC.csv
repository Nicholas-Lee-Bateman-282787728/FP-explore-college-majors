2274420,5,B0009A40FC,"Gather `round the ol' DVD player and get ready for a second batch of random Rambo episodes from our friends at Lions Gate.  Everybody loves ninjas, and this collection is chock-full of ninja action...along with a few pirates, a magician, and a voodoo priestess thrown in for good measure.  What's more, Transformers fans will enjoy hearing the voice of legendary Autobot leader Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) during several of these Rambo adventures.  This thrill-packed potpourri includes episodes 20, 41, 19, 35, 49, 57, 24, 28, 44, 23, and 5 from the classic animated series.  It does NOT include episode 4, `Raise the Yamato', as the back of the case incorrectly states.  Unfortunately, Volume 2 suffers from some much more noticeable video abnormalities than Volume 1, the worst of which being the persistent flickering of some nasty horizontal lines across the screen during the first half of `Mephisto's Magic.'  It's enough to make you exclaim (as Turbo does in episode 23), ""My stomach feels like it just crossed the Atlantic with Columbus!""  Well, at least the background music (from composer Jerry Goldsmith) is always present, which is more than I can say for `Thundercats Season One Volume One'...but I digress.  Will you enjoy Rambo Volume 2 in spite of its flaws?--Count on it!  `Cause any disc featuring a scene in which twin ninjas do battle on top of a moving van is a must have; and any cartoon featuring a heavily-armed character named Mad Dog who zooms around on a motorcycle shouting things like, ""Let's hit `em with lead `til they're good and dead,"" has GOT to be cool!  But Rambo is educational too, and I'll prove it by closing this review with what I like to call...RAMBO's Words of Wisdom:
""Civilization has its advantages, but if it weren't for the wilderness what good would it be?""
""A brother's love is a precious and sacred trust.""
""Doing my job well is its own reward.""
""Parents are a lot more forgiving than most kids think.""
""Just because somebody tells you something doesn't mean it's true. You always have to check the facts for yourself.""
""Smoke isn't as dense near the floor.""
""Voodoo is nothing but a lot of hocus-pocus.""
""Dogs can be a good judge of bad people.""
""Bullies must be stopped--no matter who they are, or what the cost.""
""It all comes down to teamwork--no matter what you're doin'.""
""Freedom is the one gift that's for all or none.""",1125187200,3,2381,4.813725490196078
2274421,4,B0009A40FC,"This cartoon is a lot of fun - it's a more gentle, talkative Rambo than the movies, but the theme music and death-defying stunts are still there.  There's three main problems with these discs (this and Volume 1):
1. No special features (unless you count ""Full Screen Version"" and ""2.0 Dolby Digital Audio"" as they do on the package)
2. There's an error on the episode listing on the Vol 2 package: ""Raise the Yamato"" should be ""The Taking of Tierra Libre""
3. The episodes are in semi-alphabetic order on the disks, rather than the much more logical order that they aired.  This is especially problematic since the first 5 episodes of the series were a 5-parter, and only parts 3 and 5 are on these sets.
Despite the problems, I recommend this dvd because the series is so much fun to watch.",1119398400,2,790,4.5174825174825175

it was a descent series cashing in on the popularity of the rambo franchise from the 80's but it'd be more enjoyable if Lionsgate'd re-release the DVD's with the episodes in order. also please be advised the mislabelling of the final episode on the back of the case is NOT Raise the Yamato, but The Taking of Tierra Libre. hope this helps those who order the dvd.",1347840000,3,869,4.304878048780488
8058764,5,B0009A40FC,"I was THRILLED to see this as well as some of my other 80's favorites hit DVD (i.e., Voltron, Transformers, MOTU).... I had recorded about 6 of the original Rambo episodes back when they originally aired on VHS. Needless to say, the quality was terrible, barely viewable and I really was discouraged when I thought that I would never see these or any other episodes again.

The episodes are like any other in a series-some of them are fantastic and action packed, while others you wonder if they had someone's 10 year old come up with the script and dialog ideas. But in all fairness no show I have ever seen, animated or not, was 100% entertaining, 100% of the time.

My only real disappointment was the fact that they only cleaned up some of the episodes. Not sure how one episode was picked over another, perhaps they were ""fan favorites"", and they only had a limited budget. But having them on DVD, well can't and shouldn't complain.

Thanks guys at Lions Gate for releasing them! :-)",1264636800,2,988,4.570621468926554
8058765,5,B0009A40FC,"This is a great cartoon to have in your collection. Not only is the voice of Rambo by Neil Ross (Lion-o of the Thundercats cartoon series) but it is a great action cartoon. the thing i like most about this series is that when Rambo fires his weapons actual bullets are being fired, not lasers as most other cartoons. The only thing bad about this cartoon release is that the episodes are not in the correct order of television release but if you can get a episode list, you could watch them in the correct order. Other than that, this is a great dvd.",1217030400,,550,4.298076923076923
8058766,4,B0009A40FC,"Rambo and the Force of Freedom fights against the S.A.V.A.G.E. evil forces led by General Warhawk and his hechmen who tries to impose their will and control different countries in the world.

The Pentagon has Colonel Samuel Trautman and the Force of Freedom in charge of dealing with all situations that compromizes the world's peace.

Expert mechanic Turbo,master of disguise Kat and ninja White Dragon helps Rambo on his tasks against Sgt. Havoc and an all sort of villanins and mercenaries.

I used to watch this when I was a kid and I like it. Graphic violence is show but noone is hurt(audiencies are 5 and up).

Overall a great entertainment.",1135814400,,648,4.8108108108108105
8058767,3,B0009A40FC,"This series reminds me of G.I. Joe with explosions and no deaths.  It is great to have 11 episodes on one disc.  There are two problems I have with this disc.

1. two episodes are messed up with interference.

2. episodes are out of order, especially when you only get two episodes (1 on each disc) of the five part ""Tierra Libre"" story.  Also, the last title on the back of this DVD is not the title on the disc.

To the person who only got two episodes, I feel badly for you since my DVD has eleven.  Try again, and see if they can send you a complete one.",1126742400,4,558,4.0181818181818185
8058768,1,B0009A40FC,"What a Rip Off - Only 2 episodes per disc.

I am not only a big fan of the Rambo animated series, I also had the chasnce to work on it. So, when I found out the episodes were coming out on dvd, I pre-ordered them without researching more info on the discs set for release. The discs list about 11 episodes, but only have 2. I thought this must be a mistake somehow. I then played the disc in a few players and still only episodes appeared. A friend asked me did I really belive that 11 episodes would be fit on one disc if not double-sided? Which this is not. I have returned both volumes 1 - 2 for refunds. What a Rip Off!",1125619200,,623,3.9444444444444446
