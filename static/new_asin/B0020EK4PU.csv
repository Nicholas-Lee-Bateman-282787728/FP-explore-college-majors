Granted the lead character Jake (or Jakeem actually) is made to be an exaggerated dorky ""white like"" black male who's blind to racism in his personal world..but after losing his job in the most unfair, racist way you see how his life continues to spiral further down and he finally awakens to how unfair reality can be in a racist world. What I like about the film is that it points out racism not only from white people in America, but from other minorities to black people as well. Very eye opening and educational!",1497571200,,628,4.469565217391304

8348517,4,B0020EK4PU,"This movie was real life to me.  What this young man experienced on his job happens a lot to minorities in the real business world, the educational system, etc.,  where systematically someone's joy and drive can be stripped away because of racism.",1389744000,,247,4.857142857142857
8348518,2,B0020EK4PU,"The message shared in this movie is relevant. However, the film may be a bit outdated. I rate it 2.5-3 because it is an awkward film and it is easy to NOT like it. It really depends upon your understanding of social issues.",1347926400,,223,4.209302325581396
8348519,5,B0020EK4PU,"The Minority is a funny, dramatic, eye opening film about the many
ways racism and race relations affects the lives of african americans.
 This story examines how racism  affects black american identity, job
opportunity, and societal behavior towards blacks. Although the film
tackles difficult subject matter, it does so stylishly with humour and
a great soundtrack.  Its a movie that all Americans should see to have
a better understanding of our country and ultimately ourselves.",1283817600,,482,5.4
