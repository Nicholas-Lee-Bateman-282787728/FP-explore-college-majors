8114618,5,B000EURHO8,"In the program McCoy accidentally injects himself with substance that makes him paranoid and is compelled to leave the ship for the planet they are near. Through a series of events he goes through a portal to old earth (depression era). Some how he changes history and the Enterprise disappears. So the mission is to retrieve McCoy before he changes time. This naturally includes a love interest (Joan Collins.)

Read the book on Harlan Ellison's Manuscript first (ISBN: 1565049640). This is not a serialization of the program; it is the original written script. You will be surprised at the transformation from a Harlan Ellison novel to a Star Trek episode (28).

To fit the mold of the series McCoy replaced a drug dealer. The first thing Harlan asked was that if clothes were stolen that they did not look like they were miraculously a perfect fit. And Spock stops Kirk from saving Edith. Kirk would have given up the future for love.

Now watch this episode, and yes the changes were necessary and this is one of the best.",1505865600,,1026,4.720670391061453

8114620,5,B000EURHO8,"Everyone who has watched Star Trek over the years knows and loves this episode. Owning it is rewarding, as it can be watched again and again. But it raises questions. What about Harlan Ellison's original script, which (unlike the filmed version) won a Writer's Guild of America award? What are the political implications? And there's the point another reviewer brought up... does the importance of Edith Keeler fade due to Kirk's subsequently prodigious love life?

As you may recall, Kirk and Spock must travel back in time to 1930s Earth, to fix something that went wrong due to another time traveler. (In the filmed version, this is McCoy, who accidentally suffers a drug overdose and escapes to a planet where a time portal exists.) They travel to the past and meet Edith Keeler, a Depression-era social worker with visionary ideas played by Joan Collins -- yes, THAT Joan Collins, and she is luminous in this role, commanding the episode whenever she is on screen.

But there's a particularly rough twist of fate: Spock learns that if Edith Keeler does not die, she will lead a peace movement that delays the entrance of the USA into WWII, thus letting the Nazis win. Therefore Edith Keeler must die, tho Kirk has fallen into love with her. I have always been disturbed by this story line, because it suggests that pacism is wrong, even though (at least at times) Trek seemed to be endorsing a platform friendly to pacifism. (But, to be fair, the Enterprise did pack a lot of weaponry, and some of the most exciting episodes involved space battles.)

Yet watching the episode recently on tape, I decided that the idealism more than makes up for the hedge against pacifism. Someday man will harness incredible energies and reach for the stars, Edith declares, and the millions spent on death and destruction will someday be used to solve the problems of mankind rather than to hurt people. The beauty of it all is that we listen to these speeches through the eyes and ears of Kirk and Spock, and we therefore ""know"" her idealism will prevail. In 1967, we DID know that mankind would survive the problems of the 30s and 40s, some of the worst that humanity ever faced. Might we therefore survive the problems that beset us today and expect the bright future that Kirk and Spock take for granted?

Even Harlan Ellison, ranting against Roddenberry, admitted that this romantic idealism was likely due to Roddenberry's tinkering with the script. It is his vision of the future at its finest.

Now, as to Ellison's original script. That script had much less of a role for McCoy. I find that replacing a renegade drug dealer (from the original script) with a drugged-out McCoy was probably for the best. De Kelly, as McCoy, does some of his best acting in the entire series here, going from calm to lunatic to desperate to charming. My favorite line: ""That's quite all right dear... because I don't believe in you either.""

The biggest change deals with Kirk's decision. Can he sacrifice the woman he loves in order to save millions of people? In Ellison's original script, Kirk is blinded by love and is unable to make the right decision. According to Ellison, this made him more fallible and human, and was therefore better.

But c'mon already. In the course of Star Trek, Kirk saves the galaxy, or at least entire planets, how many times???  Would a man whose role it is to save the galaxy turn away from the right decision when the entire future is at stake? Just for one woman? Could he possibly do less than Rick in Casablanca, who finally realized that the lives of a couple of people mean little when the whole world is in the balance? It is enough, I think, for Kirk to be psychologically torn apart by what he has to do... elsewhere in the series, he unfailingly does the right thing, at least by the final act, but he usually does it so easily. (A theme later explored in Star Trek II.) For our hero to have to feel such pain seems, to me, to be asking enough. Then there is the question of whether Edith Keeler means much in light of all the affairs Kirk has later. Well, watching the tape again put my mind at ease. As I stated, Joan Collins commands the screen and takes over the episode. There is never another heroine like her, not on ST nor on any ST spinoff. Edith Keeler's idealism is truly Roddenberry's own. It is not surprising that Kirk's affairs are so ephemeral after this episode. We never meet a woman of her equal again.

All the creative elements in this episode -- the writing (including the marvelous little touches of humor in the script), the acting, the music, even the cinematography are all at their finest. The basic idea of the story is still Ellison's, while the nuances and fine points are due to Roddenberry, DC Fontana, and others. But in any event, the result is a poetic masterpiece, like nothing television ever produced since.",1182988800,,4870,4.653488372093023
8114621,5,B000EURHO8,"Here we have what is clearly the most famous, most admired and most controversial ""Star Trek"" episode, ""The City on the Edge of Forever."" As I would think most people know by know, McCoy goes back in time through the time portal of the Guardian of Forever and changes history. Kirk and Spock follow to set things right, ending up in the U.S. during the Great Depression where they learn that the focal point in time is Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), a social worker: Because McCoy will save her life, Edith will lead a peace movement that will delay U.S. involvement in World War II, allowing Hitler time to create the atomic bomb first and win the war (which is not a good thing). Unfortunately, Kirk falls in love with Edith and does not want her to die.

Originally written by Harlan Ellison, who has published both the original script and his side of what really happened (that's an understatement), the only thing everybody can agree on is that changes were made in the script. The biggest difference in the two versions has to do with which character prevents Edith from being saved: in the episode it is Kirk, but in the original script it is Spock. Ellison's point was that Kirk was willing to sacrifice the future for love; the powers that be maintained their hero would not act that way. But then they also think that two hundred years from now no one will remember Clark Gable (or ""Gone With the Wind"" apparently).

Ironically, these two opinions are enshrined in the second and third Star Trek movies, where we go from the good of the many outweighs the good of the one (Spock sacrifices live to save the ship), to the good of the one outweighs the good of the many (Kirk save Spock at the expense of his career). I have to admit that I very much like both versions; it was years before I stopped crying when I watched the end of ""The City on the Edge of Forever."" Yet as great as that ending is, with Kirk having nothing to say about what has happened except ""Let's get the hell out of here,"" what Ellison was attempting was even more operatic.

Ultimately, what hurts this episode the most is not the great debate over which version is superior, but that Kirk would have a different girl on a different planet for what seemed like every other episode during the rest of the series, which undermines his (supposedly) epic love for Edith Keeler (Compare this with the rather limited and therefore more poignant episodes of Jean-Luc Picard as a star-crossed lover on ""STNG""). If you have not read Ellison's script, then you should do so. You can even skip the vitriolic account of the bad blood between Ellison and Gene Roddenberry, but there is a minor character named Trooper in the script who deserves to be remembered because he was deemed negligible by history.",1143504000,2,2775,4.568273092369478
