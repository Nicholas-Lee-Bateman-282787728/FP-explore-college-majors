8534230,5,B0091JJ1Y2,"I was a bit nervous to order due to the low rating, but the Thai movie Shutter is one of my all-time favorite horror films and I couldn't find it anywhere else. I watched both disks as soon as my order arrived, due to other reviews saying there was a problem with the subtitles/sound. Clearly, one reviewer did not bother to go to the disks' set up screens to add subtitles-- both films have English subtitles as an option. And I personally experienced no problems with the sound skipping as another reviewer said.

The quality of the disks and the packaging was great, and the price was outstanding. I am very happy with this purchase, and I'm stoked to finally own Shutter!",1511308800,,675,4.532786885245901

8534232,5,B0091JJ1Y2,"Shutter is one of the creepiest movies ever.  Highly recommend it as an antidote to all the big yawn English-speaking horror movies out there.  And for Pete's sake, don't EVER watch the American remake, which stinks.",1428019200,,216,4.972222222222222
