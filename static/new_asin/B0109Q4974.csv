7306967,5,B0109Q4974,"I was completely floored by this Deep Purple performance!! I bought this DVD expecting it to be very good, but I did not expect to have my mind blown by the BEST ROCK BAND on the planet!!! The band is absolutely ON FIRE!!! I have been a Steve Morse fan since the late 70s and have seen the Dixie Dregs play live 4 different times, The Steve Morse Band 3 times, and I enjoy his work with Flying Colors too (hope to catch them live someday too), but his playing with Deep Purple is simply outstanding here. His presence in the band really revived them to new heights. I grew up listening to Deep Purple in the late 60s and have followed them ever since. Frankly, they have never sounded better than they do here, even without the great Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore. This really proves that just because they got older and lost a vital band member (Lord), does not necessarily mean that they are just mimicking themselves in their glory days, which is really refreshing! They are the only rock band on the planet that can truly rival Led Zeppelin! So if you are a fan of any of these guys, I very much recommend this excellent blue-ray live concert film!",1447459200,6,1153,4.392523364485982
7306968,5,B0109Q4974,Great live album. Awesome opener with highway star. Very solid and well produced.,1447286400,3,81,5.3076923076923075
7306969,2,B0109Q4974,I'm only giving this two stars cause Morse still has chops. I loved their last studio work but this is garbage. Ian Gillan sounds horrible...is off key...unintelligable and looks constipated. Rest of the band eh. So so going through the motions. The 5.1 DTS HD isnt. No surrounds at all. And not that good sounding a stereo mix either. The stage is a huge outdoor venue and since most of the show takes place during daylight its very plain and generic. Picture 90 thousand people and drunken bodies being passed overhead. Goober and friends. Pass unless you're a raving fan.,1447113600,3,574,4.75

7306974,5,B0109Q4974,Saw DP a few months ago at The Ryman in Nashville. This is almost the same setlist. DP was phenomenal. This 3D  Bluray set is a great souveiner of that show. The 3D feature is pretty cool. The sound is state of the art. Highly reccomend.,1442534400,9,237,4.1521739130434785
7306975,5,B0109Q4974,I was there at Wacken 2013 for this show. Amazing performance as always from Deep Purple. Great sound and amazing audience! Germany rules.,1442016000,5,138,5.043478260869565
7306976,5,B0109Q4974,this is a 3d blu ray of the great band performing live.  It was filmed in 3d and does not cost 36.00 like the other reviewer says.  It is out for 19.99 on this site and that's a fact.  If you love deep purple or 3d films then this one is for you.,1441670400,13,246,3.6037735849056602

8721718,1,B0109Q4974,"Very disappointing Blu-ray. The video was not in sync with the audio. Ruined the whole thing. Songlist is exactly the same as ""To the Rising Sun"" Blu-ray, but ""To the Rising Sun"" video and audio were in sync, and were recorded much, much better. I'd recommend buying ""To the Rising Sun"" and skipping ""From the Setting Sun.""",1484265600,2,323,4.684210526315789
