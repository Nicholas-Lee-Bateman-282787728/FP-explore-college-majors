2913053,2,B000U076SY,"I too was taken by this scam, and now am disputing over $100 in charges through the Better Business Bureau --the first time I have ever had to do this. This company has a 'D' rating with them. They have a really slick bait-and-switch operation going, like I have never seen in all my many years buying on-line. I am fighting breast cancer right now, which is the reason my monthly mailings went on unnoticed for a few months -- my dear husband took over the bills and set my DVDs aside for me, not realizing that I had never intended to join a club, only buy a few DVDS. So at a time when I don't need any extra headaches, here they come to make my life miserable. So if you intend to buy these DVDs anywhere, even used, please do not, just on principle. Don't support a company like this with your dollars. There are plenty of good workout tapes out there. The workout is decent enough, but it didn't change my life, only their business practices did -- for the worse!",1219795200,35,969,4.271739130434782
2913054,1,B000U076SY,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!  I foolishly did not read the fine print and began receiving a monthly shipment.  After cancelling in June and being assured that there would be no more charges, I was charged again in July.  The customer service rep informed me that the bill was divided up into two portions which was the ridiculous reason I was again charged.  Shame on Linda LaRue!  She is only out to make a quick buck.",1217289600,42,428,4.435897435897436
2913055,1,B000U076SY,"I ordered from an APO address which was a shipment option.  I waited a month and half, and then contacted the company for a reshipment.  Another month and half went by no video.  They said they would refund my card which they did, but I requested an email confirmation and never received one.  Also when speaking to the company rep on the phone, she twice put me on hold for one second to talk to her so called supervisor.  Then got back on and gave me at least a three to five second explanation.  I think they provide poor customer service, and I feel the rep blatantly lied to me several times on the phone.  Would love to try the video but won't give this company my money.",1216339200,14,677,4.2421875
2913056,1,B000U076SY,"I ordered one of these DVDs.  Paid for it and received it and all was fine.  Then a month later I received a box full of more CDs with no invoice, no packing slip, nothing.  I checked my credit card and boom, there was a charge for these items which I didn't order.  Apparently they have one of these subscription clubs.  I'm very sure when I ordered the DVD that nothing was said about this being a club with automatic monthly shipments.  Now I have to go to the trouble of disputing the charge.",1215820800,53,496,4.223404255319149
2913057,2,B000U076SY,"I bought this video after seeing it advertised on tv.  What a waste of money.  The quality of the video is so distorted its hard to watch.  The exercises although effective are geared toward people who have been exercising for months or years and have strong arm and neck muscles.  It is so fast paced that you have a hard time keeping up.

All in all if you want a more advanced workout then this is a good video if you can handle the quality.",1209513600,50,444,4.176470588235294
2913058,3,B000U076SY,"Well, I own the video.  I haven't had a chance to open the package it came in.  I am a bit frustrated with how they run their business. I am wondering if they got waaaay more orders than they expected to get so their business is just running poorly at the moment.  I ordered mine through their website.  I had to click through NUMEROUS ""add this offer for FREE!"" things to get to the final page to actually buy & conclude my purchase.  It was quite annoying.  I *did* actually click on one of the ""FREE!"" things to add to my order.  Silly me, I got to the very end, after I confirmed that I wanted to do this, THEN they told me, ""Your order is confirmed....  "" and the ""FREE!"" item actually added $7 (!!!) to my order!  I hardly call adding $7 ""Free.""  I called them up right away to cancel.  They couldn't do it.  Told me to call back in 24 hours.  Which I couldn't for my own reasons. I sent an e-mail with the confirmation number of my purchase. Told them to cancel my order.  I received the product in the mail about a week later.  It is now 2 weeks since I've received it, and I *just* received an e-mail ""We cannot cancel your order because it's already been processed and shipped out.""  Well, duh.  I wrote them a note saying that they need to shape up.  And that they need to change their website since I'm sure it's not their intention to deceive anyone that ""FREE!"" actually means, ""$7.00""",1209340800,28,1399,4.215094339622642
2913059,1,B000U076SY,"I tried all 3 workouts.  While they may be technically ""crunchless"" the movements still involve neck straining positions and left me injured.  There were also several movements that put a lot of strain on the lower back.  I am very slender and fit but would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this product to anyone.",1207958400,59,306,4.846153846153846
2913060,2,B000U076SY,"I too am still waiting for my order to arrive. I did e-mail the company & got a response that they were waiting for a shipment. The another one a few weeks later saying that it would be delayed even more. It has now been 2 months. I can not rate the video itself of course, since I have not had the chance to view it, but I did give the product 2 stars, because I would like to give the company the benefit of the doubt, since they did respond to my e-mail.",1202428800,28,457,3.872340425531915
2913061,1,B000U076SY,"I would love to say that this product works, but guess what?
I placed my order over two weeks ago. My account STILL has not been charged for the order. All I have is an order confirmation. Their web site doesn't have an order-lookup, so I have to play the waiting game, wondering if they are going to charge my account or not. I've sent them an email, so we'll see how that goes.....",1200528000,27,383,4.1891891891891895
2913092,1,B000U076SY,"I only got the number one, it was not the one in the picture or advertised, it was suppose to be crunchless abs 1,2 &3, it was only 1. I was very dissappointed",1388880000,,159,3.8484848484848486
2913093,2,B000U076SY,"The exercises in this DVD are actually difficult to do and harmful if you have back problems.  I can't do crunches as I have neck and shoulder problems, and this DVD made them worse.",1386288000,,182,4.352941176470588
2913094,4,B000U076SY,"This is great workout since you can do 10, 20 or 30 minutes depending on how much time you have.",1371513600,,96,3.85
2913095,4,B000U076SY,"You will need a steady chair to do some of these exercises. Those are the only ones I do. While Denise Austin's DVDs are my personal favorite, I supplement with Crunchless Abs so I don't strain my back.",1367366400,,202,4.342105263157895
2913096,1,B000U076SY,Shame on this company! Can't they find a better way of making money than stealing and hustling. I bought the DVD and they enrolled me in an automatic program to keep getting more DVDs every other month without my agreement. Then when I tried to cancel they insisted I have to make another payment. How many ab DVDs do they think I need. Isn't there a law against this?,1358899200,,368,4.3478260869565215
2913097,3,B000U076SY,Kinda easy. Still some good stretches. Like yoga but not as fun. The girl hosting is a bit annoying and the music is pretty bad.,1344297600,,128,4.16
2913098,1,B000U076SY,When I ordered this product I was not aware that I needed additional equipment to use the DVD. On the back there is a picture of a woman using resistance bands attached to a door. Did not want to open the DVD to find out if there was a modified version. So I sent them back.,1344211200,,274,3.9107142857142856
2913099,5,B000U076SY,"I ordered this product with the intention of finding something different that would get me out of a rut.  It provided all that and MORE!!!  As a former military professional, I am familiar with lots of abdominal work, but this DVD was so AWESOME, I wish I came across it sooner.  It is not difficult, but not easy, either.  In my opinion, it's just right: not your traditional moves, not boring, trully refreshing.  It helped me work abdominal muscles I forgot I possessed! :)

I recommend it to anyone who wants a flat tummy!  This WORKS!",1326412800,5,539,4.552083333333333
2913100,1,B000U076SY,"You have to careful with a lot off these companies. It's not just this one that send you stuff with out your asking. If I want something now I ALWAYS ask is they are going to bill me for anything I'm didn't ask for. Just get in habit of asking because I have never gotten my money back for 'sneaky charges'.
Hope this helps.",1322784000,3,324,4.078125
2913101,1,B000U076SY,"I realized why I got this DVD so cheap on Amazon - about $14 cheaper than the TV ad.  It's because it's WAY TOO HARD to do and I got someone's return!  And I'm not out of shape, but if you think you're going to get away with the pain and discomfort from crunching abs exercises, well - this is no PICNIC!",1307836800,,304,3.8870967741935485
2913122,1,B000U076SY,"Beware when ordering this product, they automatically sign you up for additional shipments. You have to call them after placing your order to cancel your subscription within 30 days. If you don't you'll get a shipment and have to pay to return the items to them for a refund.",1266019200,2,275,4.63265306122449

2913124,1,B000U076SY,"Bought the Crunchless Abs 1-2-3 Combo DVD kit.  It is definitely not worth even $12.98 (plus S & H), especially if you have any experience at all with ab workouts.  The workouts are very short and ineffective.  Also, the video is of poor quality.  I would not recommend this workout video for anyone!!",1248652800,4,301,4.622641509433962
2913125,1,B000U076SY,"3/09/09 I purchased crunchless abs online. While checking out from purchasing my product, a few web pages came up asking me id I'd like to try such and such products. The essential boost was one of those products asking would I like to try it for free. I clicked yes. After that, I was taken to a final check out area where I was charged 10.95 shipping on this ""free"" product. At that point, I wanted to cancel that ""free"" product however, I was unable to go back to the original checkout page and I was also unable to cancel my order right there online. I was STUCK with the essential boost supposed ""free"" product. So, I chalked it up as a learning experience; I would not be haggled again after purchasing an online product. I would, in the future, reject all ""free"" products offered to me after my initial purchase. It was a $10.95 lesson. But then I began receiving those essential boost products mailed to me and having unauthorized withdrawals from my checking account. That warranted a phone call to customer service line for crunchless abs. Then I learned that I had been enrolled in a subscription to this once upon a time ""free"" product. Really? So, I cancelled right then and there and sent the product back to the company where of course I paid for the return shipping. just a little over a week later, I was charged AGAIN. This to me is stealing! Same kind of shipping, charging, and enrollment began with crunchless abs product.
I am furious because this company continues to take money from my account and I have had to pay shipping for the return of these additional products which where sent to me, unwarranted.",1242172800,15,1629,4.563139931740614
2913126,1,B000U076SY,"Like everyone else I purchased just the ONE DVD and continued to receive more, which I shipped back at my own expense and then fought with them for credits on it and future charges they made.  Turned them in to my Credit Card company, have gotten a refund for the merchandise but not the shipping charges to me for product which I never asked to receive in the first place and I had already covered the charges back to them.  So, I continue to fight.  I buy most of these things on Amazon, but unfortunately bought this direct and wish I had seen all these reviews on Amazon first!  Thank you Amazon for helping protect consumers.  Shame on Crunchless Abs and all such companies. Next I'm reporting them to the BBB.",1238457600,11,715,4.427480916030534
2913127,1,B000U076SY,"The same thing happened to me.  Ordered about one month ago (that would be just the one tape).  Today the UPS man pulls up with another box full of tapes and resistance bands which I did NOT order.  I have never ""fallen prey"" to some program like this and I've been around a while.  They are essentially stealing your credit card information and continuing to charge on it, plain and simple.  I guess I'll be contacting the Better Business Bureau too. Oh, and to answer the question that one person keeps asking ""are the videos any good/just review the video.......?"".  If they were any good do you think they would have to do business this way!!!!",1237507200,10,648,4.543103448275862
2913128,1,B000U076SY,I'll just agree with all of the other reviews that point out how shady these guys are. We also received a shipment that we did not order and have yet to see the money returned to our credit card. Don't buy from these people.,1236816000,16,224,4.113636363636363
2913129,2,B000U076SY,"I want a review about the dvd, all this companies do the same. The best deal is: send a email to the contact number asking them if you can pay with check or money order, they will say yes, so send the check or money order to the address that they give to you, and that is it. You don't receibe any other dvd in your life. Please reviews about the dvd. Thank you!!!",1229558400,15,364,3.9324324324324325
2913130,1,B000U076SY,"This company is a marketing scam organization.  Their ""free"" products are not.  They do their best to not refund returns.  I was so disgusted by the addtional products later received (and refused) and the hassle that I went through to get my money refunded that I have not even looked at the tape.  After reading some of the other reviews, I think this is probably a good thing.

DO NOT BUY from these people.  They are unethical.  I reported them to the better business bureau and encourage others to do so as well.  While they are technically legal in their practices, their intent is to defraud the public.

Don't let your friends buy from the firm.",1220918400,35,652,4.551724137931035
2913131,2,B000U076SY,"So the video in itself is a good workout- if you can stop the kids from climbing on you as you go through the excersizes.  I think that overall if you have the motivation to pop in the DVD and do the activity, you will get results.
I was not too thrilled however, when an additonal video that I did not order showed up seperately. I looked through my bank statements and sure enough I had been charged.  When I sent it back it took over a month for the refund to credit back and they still charged me the $8 for shipping!  It really wasn't worth it.",1220140800,20,549,4.064814814814815

8211654,1,B000U076SY,I got the wrong DVD and didn't notice it till I went to do the workout a few weeks later.  Got the total body instead of abs.,1464048000,,125,3.6296296296296298
