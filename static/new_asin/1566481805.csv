7796726,2,1566481805,"Liked the program, love history, but some misrepresentation of facts. It was stated at least a couple of times that the Vikings were the last pagans of Europe. This is incorrect. Lithuania, a Baltic country, was the last pagan nation in Europe, not Christianized until 1387. The Vikings were Christianized between 800-1200 C.E. Was a bit dismayed at this misinformation and so wondered what else was incorrect in the program.",1422057600,,425,5.085714285714285

7796728,4,1566481805,"Had seen this program on PBS before ordering the DVD so the content was known. However, when running it on our regular TV, it looked like it was overexposed. The colors did not come out as bright as it should. Running movie DVDs on the same DVD player and TV gives the right colors. Don't know if the ordered DVD is defective in any way or somehow the player and TV are a mis-match. We will in the near future re-run the DVD on a different DVD player and TV to doublecheck the exposure.
The contents of the DVD is very good and a large step above a travel video. From the perspective of content it is recommended.",1278288000,3,613,4.203389830508475
