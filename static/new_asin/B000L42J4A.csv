8160033,5,B000L42J4A,"Lortzing's little or lesser known opera, in a very serious TV production, starring the young Lucia Popp and others, including Hans Sotin as the Major.
There are quite a lot of dialogues (its a singspiel), but I do not find it hideous, even if I don't speak German, and the version i watched had only Japanese subtitles, which meant that I could only guess at the dialogues.
Small matter. The music is very good, and the arias sublime.
The Marquis from some where sung an aria (or duet) so beautifully with Marie (Lucia Popp), that this same aria was recorded by Fritz Wunderlich during his last month on earth with DG (do go and look for it).
Hans Sotin and Lucia Popp played father and daughter, with two other tenors playing the Russian duo of the Tsar Peter the Great and the other Russian Peter (Milanov).
The story is quite straightforward, but there are a lot in the singing, acting and dramatic portrayal to watch and listen. In short, this is VERY entertaining stuff.
What I must stress is that this film shows Lucia Popp at her youthful prime, and her singing and acting are totally not of this world!
A must own for opera lovers, and Popp's fans.",1323734400,,1156,4.535885167464115

8160035,4,B000L42J4A,"Not a great work, Zar und Zimmermann is nonetheless an entertaining opera.  In the hands of Rolf Liebermann, it's actually a delight.  The young and nubile Lucia Popp is, as always, marvelous. It's possible this is the earliest footage of her we have.  All the singing is quite good.

The highlight of the entire production is the hilarious choral directing scene.  If you have ever sung in a choir, you'll be in stitches.  The usually somber Hans Sotin is in wonderful voice and is very funny as the simpleton mayor-cum-choral director.  This famous scene is outstanding - the chorus acts and sings extremely well.  But it's Hans Sotin who makes the entire performance memorable with his satirical and exaggerated spoof of the archetypal choir director.  I watched that one scene many times over and for that alone this DVD was a good investment.  It's rare to find an opera on DVD that can actually make me laugh, but this one did!",1197676800,12,933,4.739130434782608
8160036,3,B000L42J4A,"I can think of several reasons why some one would buy this album. 1. Likes comic opera. 2. A fan of Lucia Popp. 3. This is an unfamiliar opera composed by an unfamiliar composer; checks it out and makes sure nothing would be missed. 4. All the above.
I usually do not criticize the plot of an opera; no matter it is too silly, too complicated, or whatever. I just take as it is. But for a comic opera this one is not funny. There is no comic element in the story; throw in some comic gesture here and there does not make it a comic opera. Don't expect to see or hear something like The Marriage of Figaro or The Barber of Seville. The music itself is not even come close to Flotow's Martha.
The story goes briefly like this: Peter the Great went to the city called Saardam in Holland, and worked in a shipyard (hided his true identity, of course) to learn shipbuilding. The city's mayor and the ambassadors from England and France are looking for him. They mistaken the other Russian fellow named Peter, who also works in the shipyard, for the Czar. As a subplot, this Peter fellow and the niece of the mayor (named Marie) are in love. They finally got married as the Czar sails off and heading back to Russia.
The opera is called Czar and Carpenter. It makes you think that the story is about the interrelationship between them (like Romeo and Juliette, for example). But it is not.
In fact neither one had much to sing. The better music went to the mayor and the French ambassador. As for Marie, she did not have much to sing neither. I expected to hear more of her. The much-anticipated bride's song in Act II was only lasted for a few bars. This is rather odd.
As for the composer, Albert Lortzing, he is not totally unfamiliar to me. I have a CD, another opera of his, called UNDINE. It is a much better opera, and has much better music. Its mysterious story is in some way parallel to Dvorak's Rusalka. Possibly one was derived from the other. Just don't know who imitates whom. The album has a much stronger cast too. So if you have never been exposed to Lortzing's music before and bought this album with a low expectation you may like it after watch it a few times. Just see/hear Lucia Popp is more than worth it. Actually, it is worthwhile to check it out just for curiosity seeks. You may never get to see/hear this from a broadcast. Unless you can borrow it from a friend, you would have to buy it.
And finally, if I were the composer, I would call this opera Czar in Saardam (or Czar in Holland), not Czar and Carpenter.",1186531200,3,2533,4.323529411764706
8160037,4,B000L42J4A,"A very good production of an opera not well known outside Germany. You will probably never see this opera in a live production so take the oportunity to view this well sung and well filmed ""movie"" version.",1178928000,3,205,4.5675675675675675
8160038,5,B000L42J4A,"Albert Lortzing's 'Zar and Zimmermann', written in 1837, is a marvelously constructed comedy of mistaken identities which rises above the usual farcical conventions and provides not only a satisfying plot but some excellent musical characterizations of what otherwise might have been stereotyped roles. In it Czar Peter the Great is working in the shipyards of Saardam (as he actually did in order to learn the shipbuilding trade) under the pseudonym of Peter Michaelov. Another Russian is also working there and also named Peter (Ivanov). Various international intriguers confuse their respective identities and comedy ensues. There are the usual stock characters: a beautiful lass, Marie, daughter of the comic burgermeister Van Bett, the foppish French ambassador, various rough and tumble village characters, a worldly widow and so on. Peter Ivanov is in love with Marie and through various machinations is finally united with her. Through it all Peter the Great acts with great wisdom and humanity, a sort of Hans Sachs of the piece. (In fact, Wagner was much influenced musically and dramatically by Lortzing.)

'Zar und Zimmermann' is not terribly well-known outside German-speaking countries. I was introduced to it thirty-five years ago by a Austrian couple who led me to the classic recording featuring Nicolai Gedda, Hermann Prey, Peter Schreier, Gottlob Frick and Erika Koth, conducted by Robert Heger. It immediately became a favorite.

I am happy to say that this film, made from a Hamburg State Opera mounting in the 1960s during the spell when Rolf Liebermann was making pioneering video opera productions for German television, meets all one's expectations. Musically it is above reproach. The cast is starry, including as it does Hans Sotin as Van Bett, Raymond Wolansky as Peter Michaelov, Lucia Popp as Marie, Horst Wilhelm as the French ambassador, and Ursula Boese as the Widow Browe. Conductor, and a marvelous feel he has for this piece, is the redoubtable Charles Mackerras.

Probably the most familiar number from this comic opera is the French ambassador's 'Lebe wohl, mein fland'risch M&auml;dchen' sung here with tender lyricism by Wilhelm. Van Bett's comic 'Sancta justitia' amuses with its clever interplay of the bass voice and an orchestral bassoon. The sophistication of the Act II finale is, in my opinion, almost at a level of finales by Mozart; high praise indeed.

The production is traditional with colorful Dutch costumes and sets and straightforward stage direction by Joachim Hess. Although recorded in a television studio, it has the feel of a stage production but with more than the usual number of close-ups and moving camera shots. Sound is fine for its time and the video is also excellent especially if one considers that this was an early color TV production.

TT=131 mins. Sound: Mono. Subtitles in English, German, Italian, Spanish. DVD 9 (all regions).

Recommended.
