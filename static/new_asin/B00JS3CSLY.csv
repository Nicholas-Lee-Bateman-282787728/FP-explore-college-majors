6389739,5,B00JS3CSLY,Seven films disaster films either caused by humans nature or biblical  in  firestorm 72 hours in Oakland A fire starts its put out quickly by the fire department  but it did not stay before you knew it  turns into A firestorm. Based on actual  event.  The other films Miami Magma dangerous deep sea drilling wakes up A sleeping volcano which threatens the city of Miami.  Death Flight  A experiment plane on flight with passengers has been sabotage by someone on the plane not realizing there's something more dangerous on board. Crash Landing and Crash dive are based on terrorist take overs Countdown Armageddon is the end of days and finally The President's Plane is Missing that's more suspense the president's plane crashes but was he on board which leads A reporter on A wild chase.  The movies all have action danger and double cross which makes them enjoyable.,1409443200,14,868,4.8108108108108105

8653690,3,B00JS3CSLY,"Lengthly movies, mostly about airline disasters but some are earthquakes.  Some are cheap-made, like B movies.",1466208000,,110,5.875
8653691,4,B00JS3CSLY,"These are some good oldies and some with a great all star cast from yesteryear. Good filler movies, some better than others. Death Flight and The President's Plane is Missing are winners. Miami Magma (amazingly goofy title) is a classic B movie but all are watchable, even if to just give budding directors a place to work up from. Always fun to get several movies for a good price.",1464912000,7,382,4.550724637681159
