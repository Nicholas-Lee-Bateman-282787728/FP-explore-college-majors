I just don't understand why these girls never crossed the pond.. Their show is great quality and they are beautiful. Im a Cheryl Cole fan and this is heaven... The woman is simply perfect...",1308268800,,387,4.315068493150685
3955288,2,B002N53XPE,"One more concert DVD ruined by cameramen who think they are the star. They cut from one shot to another so fast that you have to feel sick to your stomach.

It's a shame, because Girls Aloud are terrific.",1299456000,2,204,4.230769230769231
3955289,5,B002N53XPE,"And to put on your iPod...this thing is only available on the Universal UK website and Girls Aloud store...nice little pink box...the discs overlap and comes with a nice book with full lyrics and fan-submitted pics.

The show from 2009 is great, really entertaining, and the extras are necessary.  It's my first of Girls Aloud's 8 DVD/Blu-Rays, yes they have 8, and this is the only place to get on video the 3 ""Out Of Control"" clips for ""The Promise"", ""The Loving Kind"" and ""Untouchable"".  The 8-minute interview is fun too, but no subtitles, so unless you understand their British (and Nadine's thick Irish brogue) accents, espesh Cheryl's Geordie tongue, it might be a struggle.

I just wish Americans at large were able to get into the Girls, hear their records and see them live...because honestly, they are the best modernday girlgroup ever...a glamourous rock & roll smashup of girlgroup stereotypes and top pop tunes written with the Xenomania troupe...who started with Cher's ""Believe""...think more U2 or Adam Lambert than Spice Girls.  They do not lipsync, and have a killer band and have pretty wild stage props.  This show, aside from doing most of their best and biggest singles, they do some amazing OOC album tracks and fan faves, as well as 2 cool covers...James Morrison's ""Broken Strings"" and ""Womanizer"", done by, er, Britney Spears (not a Britney fan, sorry), but they improve the song as only GA can...plus they also do a cool extra bonus encore medley...and like I said before, this set comes with a CD to play on the go...only the ""Fan Edition"" box, not the regular DVD or Blu-Ray...but I will probably get the Blu-Ray edition in the future...as well as the other 7 videos in their catalogue...it's fun to collect GA stuff I think.

Currently, Girls Aloud are on hiatus (since 2009), with Cheryl having released 2 solo albums since (2009's ""3 Words"" with Will-I-Am and 2010's ""Messy Little Raindrops"", both megasuccessful), her TV career as an X-Factor judge, writing books and other things, and Nadine her solo debut (2010's ""Insatiable"" on her own label Black Pen), and blonde Sarah preparing her solo debut, Kimberley involved with TV and the London stage, and flamehaired Nicola involved with filmmaking and a perfume/makeup line.

Who knows if Girls Aloud will ever collaborate as a group again??  They did extend their contract for 3 more albums, but who knows if/when/how/what form this will happen and if??  If this OOC tour was indeed their last, at least they went out with a huge bang, and this show is a nice document.",1299110400,,2553,4.888888888888889

3955291,5,B002N53XPE,"Girls Aloud's 6th DVD release is one you can't miss!!! (IMO) quite a step up from the Tangled Up DVD in many ways. But most of all no band,dubbing, editing, or sound quaity issues here! Well there's a lot to get to so let's get to it...
1.)The promise-The girls start off the show with the lead single off the Out Of Control album. The ladies come in from the floor on individual rising platforms, wearing 60's style dresses and gloves much like in the video. I'm not a fan of this song to be honest but the girls do a great job.
2.)Love Is The Key- The lights go out for the dramatic intro then when the lighs come back on they reveal a mini costume change for the girls as they have taken off the bottoms of their dresses and thier gloves. In their shiny sliver cutout dresses( a little like the gold ones on the TU tour) they launch into this 60's style song and very well(IMO) aided by thier now famous very toned and talented male dancers. (note Cheryl's little wink at the camera)
3.)Biology-Unlike on The last tour where one of GA's biggest hits was ruined by bad sound and band quality this one is grand!(IMO)Nadine really takes the song to new places with some very nice vocal work and the band sounds GREAT. (the horns on the chorus are very lively and nice)plus the ladies are singing the right words (no bad dubbing here)
4.)Miss You (Bow Wow)-I don't like this song but the girls again do a great job as Cheryl and Nadine really get into it and make the song fun.
5.)The Loving Kind-After a costume change the girls come out on the individual mini runways(with thier own back round screens) to slow it down for a few. Nicola, Cheryl and Sarah really shine on this(IMO) Nicola's pleading""I'd do anything"" still sounds as heartbreaking and sad as on the cd. Cheryl and Sarah also add very nice touches in thier respective parts.
6.)Waiting-This song is one of my favs for a reason and GA really do it justice(IMO) Performing this song for the first time since the ""Chemistry"" album and tour from way back in 2005/2006. The vocals by Nadine and dancing by all the girls and dancers in a very nice way to bring this song back. Nicola's ""Mr. magic is not some toooy""(yes I spelled it like that for a reason) is also cute.
7.)Love Machine- This is not one of my favs but for the song not the performance. The girls do a wonderful job(IMO)and the dance break is another one to like.
8.)Rolling Back the Rivers In Time- A cute little filler-ish(IMO) song but Sarah over does it a little in this as frankly she does on almost the whole DVD. (Sometimes she sreeches and warbles instead of sings and just plain overdoes it, stil love her though)
9.)Untouchable-The girls have another costume change and a dramatic entrance video before coming out on their ""flying"" platform to take them to thier ""B-stage""(If you don't know what that is it's a smaller stage in the middle of the arena/stadium)Nicola's opening plus Cheryl's middle part and Nadine's ending are a gem(IMO)and really showcase each lady very well. One Of my favs.
10.)Sexy!(no,no,no)-The girls are joined again by the dancers and do a wonderful(IMO)performance of this song. Though frankly I like the one on the Tangled Up tour DVD better(as it's the show starter so much effort was put into it, not to say this didn't have effort it just feels a little flat (IMO) to me as compared to the TU tour) The girls also have a nice little dance break to the sounds of ""Disturbia"" by Rihanna.
11.)Broken Strings(James Morrison cover)- Much has been said about this cover and while some think it's a crime against humanity( yeah right) others like me think it was GREAT other than Sarah little lyrics mess-up at the begining(she says ""you"" instead of ""I"") it's a wonderful cover(IMO)Nadine and Kimberly really shine here.
12.)Love Is Pain-This disco-esque song is done well by all but not all that remarkable(IMO) as the song it's self isn't the best(IMO) but still good.
13.)Call The Shots-The girls (and dancers) bid farewell to the ""B-stage"" and go back to the main stage backwards to one of their best hits(IMO)Nadine does well(as usual) but Nicola's bridge really steals the song and stands out. Sarah should also be noted for NOT oversinging and doing a great job.
14.)Revolution In The Head- The girls have another costume change. Then after a cute, funny(curtesy of Sarah getting a little too into the beat)my fav song off of the OOC album was done right(IMO)slightly reminisant of ""Control Of The Knife"" on the TU tour in it's island flavor and dance breaks. Nadine COMANDS her part and the rest of the girls come out swinging as well. The body rolls at the end are a gem as well Thanks to Cheryl and Kimberly who go all out.
15.)Sound Of The Underground-Unlike in the Tangled Up tour(thank goodness)GA's first hit is a real treat!(IMO)on here. Yes Sarah returns to oversinging but everything else is ""Catching like fire"" no really the girls have REAL FIRE shooting up from the stage as well as flame backrounds on the screens. SOTU is done real justice(IMO)as Nadine and Cheryl take over this song and take it someehere great.
16.)Fix Me Up-As with the album version some love it some hate it. I love it, I think it was a little shock to people to see GA doing a sexy(but very tasteful)pole dance routine(yes that kind of pole)Sarah screeches yet again but at least Cheryl handles her part very well(IMO)
17.)Womanizer(Britney Spears cover)Much as also been said about this cover and while I'll admit this isn't the best song to cover and frankly(IMO) should have been left to Britney(no one can do it like her IMO)the girls do a very good job while using the dancers as puppets.
18.)Something Kinda OOH- The song is a bit of a ""tour mix"" of sorts and it's very nice(unlike many tour mixes)(IMO)It starts with a car alarm sound and mini dance then Cheryl and Nadine Kick it off keeping up a fast pace throughout. The girls take a little break to intro their band(well deserved unlike the almost band of the living dead from the last tour) and also unlike the last tour where I said looked nervous and tired( probably not helped by the hideous(IMO) 80's style neon bathing suits they were wearing at the time)The girls looked, and sounded like they were having fun.
19.)Out Of Control Megamix(1.-The Show,2.-Wake Me Up,3.-Jump,4.-No Good Advice,5.)Can't Speak French,6.-The Promise(reprise)-Oh you thought it was over didn't you? NOPE the girls have one more costume change then come out for a megamix encore of some of thier hits they didn't have room for in the show. It's very nice and the girls have a lot of fun and sound great but the reprise of the promise wasn't needed(IMO) The girls then take their last bows and thank yous of the night and let the piro and glitter finish out an AMAZING(IMO) show. DVD extras(sorry I forgot these last time)Girl Cams(you can focus soley on your fav girl during a selected song),Behind The Scenes Interview with the girls,Tour Screen Visuals(You ever wonder what's that going on on the big screen behing Cheryl? Well you can find out here on five songs where you see only the screen videos)Music Videos for: The Promise, The Loving Kind and Untouchable(not the full album version)Overall this tour shows how the girls have grown into women, where they have improved(Nadine and Sarah dancing wise, Cheryl, Nicola and KImberly singing wise) and where they still need to improve(Sarah both singing(and NOT sreeching) and dancing wise) a GA fan MUST have (IMO) that I think will win over new fans. Pop it in your player (REGION FREE,PORTABLE OR COMPUTER AS THIS IS PAL)and get ready to dance and have a great time!!!!!!!",1267833600,4,7625,4.65727002967359
