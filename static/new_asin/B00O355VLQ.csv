8681796,4,B00O355VLQ,"This is a brutal neo-noir revenge film. Julia, a nurse, gets gang raped on a date. As she attempts to recover, she falls under the influence of a psychologist with a rather unconventional treatment method.

I enjoyed this movie. It reminds me a bit, actually, of ex machina only without robots. The idea behind it of how a woman crafts her own identity especially while dealing with a sexualized male gaze is intriguing. Having said that, there are some problems. 1. the gang rapists sort of have a plan,but not really. It's clear they have orchestrated the gang rape in advance, yet they simply leave her alive by the shore. One of them even says later he was afraid the cops would come from him. One would think getting away with it would be a key part of the plan and yet that seems to be one thing they haven't thought of. 2. The psychologist and his methods. There needs to be more about this. There is a reveal about him later, but it's empty since you don't really feel any kind of connection to him.",1449100800,,1007,4.413978494623656
