1467663,5,B00005JLX8,"Roger Swanson (Campbell Scott) is a ruthless self-absorbed big city ad copywriter who spends his free time sleeping with his boss (Isabella Rossallini) and using his insulting overbearing wit in constant desperate attempts to bed every woman he meets. His boss breaks off their relationship the same day his teenaged nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) shows up seeking Roger's advice on sex and romance. Roger and Nick set out to find Nick a woman using Roger's finely-honed method of operation. Through a series of womanizing  episodes in bars and brothels, the depth of Roger's emotional dysfunction and self-loathing are revealed. Even as Roger is in many ways repulsive, he is also energetic, witty and ultimately at least partially redeemed.

Campbell Scott's portrayal of Roger Swanson's conglomeration of fierce intelligence, acute self-loathing and borderline alcoholism was one of the finest performances of 2002. I find  that the greatest performances involve an impeccable sense of timing on the part of the actor. Campbell Scott's flawless timing combined with emotional transparency and palpable energy make this performance extraordinary. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Roger Dodger also boasts an excellent supporting cast. Jesse Eisenberg is perfect as sweet, hapless, but eager-to-learn Nick. Isabella Rossallini, Elizabeth Berkley, and Jennifer Beals make solid contributions as Roger's boss and two women whom Roger and Nick try to pick up, respectively.

Roger Dodger doesn't contain any action or romance, and its humor is strictly sardonic. But it is one of the best films of 2002. If you like great movies and great performances, Roger Dodger is a Must-See.",1048118400,12,1677,5.463320463320463
1467664,5,B00005JLX8,"I must say, I am thrilled to see Elizabeth Berkley thriving as an actress and finally getting the credit she deserves.  Her performance (along with Jennifer Beals) was the absolute highlight of this film. AWESOME!",1046304000,4,213,5.085714285714285
1467665,4,B00005JLX8,"Great, darkly lit dialog piece. The pacing creeps in a way that supports the general anxiety build throughout as the main character's take on his job in advertising reveals the truth about himself. Empty fulfillment reveals itself as he takes a mentor role with his smarter than average kid cousin. Never too bleak to go on feeling ok, the movie reminds us of our constant search to fulfill, by any means, what is missing. The movie works.",1037923200,4,439,4.714285714285714
1467666,4,B00005JLX8,"Roger (Campbell Scott) is in every scene of ""Roger Dodger"" and doesn't stop talking for the entire movie. What does he talk about? Who is he talking to?
He talks about Women mostly and he talks to anyone who will listen but in particular his nephew, Nick (Jessie Eisenberg) who has come to NYC to be tutored by his uncle on the broad and fine points of how to pick up women since Nick's Mother (and Roger's sister) has called Roger a ""ladies man."" Roger spends the evening with Nick and so begins Roger and Nick's journey into ""Roger World.""
Roger does not talk about love or respect or feelings unless they are to be used as a ruse to get a woman into bed. Roger is neither deep nor caring. Roger is a bitter, smarmy creep. Roger is the blood brother of the Aaron Eckhart character in the film, ""In the Company of Men."" They both lust after women but hate themselves.
There is a great sequence in ""Roger Dodger"" involving Roger, Nick (who Roger has snuck into a Bar) and two women: Andrea (Elizabeth Berkley) and Sophie (Jennifer Beals) who Roger has asked to join he and Nick. Andrea and Sophie are smart, sexy, beautiful women who can ""see"" Roger for what he is and who are in turn fascinated by Nick's navet. Berkley and Beals have never looked more beautiful nor been as charming as they are in this scene. The director Dylan Kidd wisely, at this point in the narrative, lets some hot air out of the bag that is Roger with this delightful scene and we feel some relief, if only for a few minutes, from Roger's unrelenting chatter.
Dylan Kidd has taken some major gambles with ""Roger Dodger"": what if we had merely walked out or tuned off to this film? This very easily could have happened with an anti-hero, buffoon as his lead character. And don't think for a moment that Roger ""sees the light"" and repents. Not in the least. Campbell Scott makes the most of Roger: watch his eyes, his way of lighting his cigarette and the manner in which he smokes it. This guy is committed to making Roger as repellant yet believable as possible. And he succeeds for by the film's end we appreciate the stellar performance but somehow... do not hate the character.",1037318400,15,2156,4.460759493670886

1467831,4,B00005JLX8,"This movie is about male's view of women's world or in other words, it is highly slanted towards sexism. The movie centers around the lead character's conversation with men and women on the subject matter but it becomes quite interesting when he takes responsibility to coach his virgin nephew on the first sexual experience. For any adolescent male who has gone through this experience, a lot of similarity could be traced to certain events in the movie. However, the coaching appears supercharged, in that, the amount of information passed on to the hapless nephew in one night is so intense that could ordinarily be spread through 1-2 years period. It is, therefore, not surprising that the poor teen would be overwhelmed. Overall, I believe it is a fun movie to watch particularly by the male audience of certain age. The acting by Campbell Scott is quite convincing though the role is unusual and not easily playable by most actors.",1478995200,,937,4.89937106918239

1467970,4,B00005JLX8,"The movie begins with Roger, an ad executive in Manhattan, propounding intelligently but arrogantly his theories on sex with some colleagues and his female boss at a bar. His boss later informs him that their sexual relationship is at an end. Back at his apartment, Roger gets a visit from Nick, his 16 year old nephew from Ohio, who is in town for an earlier interview for admission to Columbia. Nick is interested about how to approach women. Roger decides to help Nick lose his virginity that night. They have various encounters in bars and at a party. The night ends rather traumatically.
We have all met characters like Roger: Smart, a know-it-all, and very obnoxious. The nephew is at the other extreme: shy, nave, polite, good-hearted. Both characters are played to perfection, making their encounters and ensuing dialogues very real. One cannot help but like the boy and despise the uncle. If it weren't for the intelligent verbal exchanges, this movie would have utterly failed. Instead, it is a detailed, penetrating study of two opposing personalities.

We find out the answer, sort of, when 16-year-old Nick spends a wild night on the prowl in New York with his playboy uncle. Eisenberg is good in his first feature film, but ""Dodger"" is delicious black comedy mostly thanks to Scott, whose Roger is a pathetic-yet-fascinating train wreck.

1467978,4,B00005JLX8,"The movie is really about relationships and interactions between men and women.  It stars Campbell Scott as Roger, a sharp talking, womanizing sleazeball who on the one hand fancies himself a pickup artist who can talk any woman into his bead, but on the other cannot get over being dumped by his boss and is totally childish and immature after she ends it.  It also stars Jesse Eisenberg as his 16 year old nephew Nick, who runs off to NY city to learn how to get women from his uncle.

The movie really is dialogue driven.  It is not an action movie at all, and even though it is billed as a comedy, it is not really a conventional comedy (at least not in the vein of something like The Hangover or any of the comedies of its ilk that have come out recently).  Really the high point of the film takes place in a bar where Roger is trying teach his nephew how to talk to girls.  It really ends up showing that Roger is not all  he claims to be, and Nick realizing that he does not really want to be all that much like his uncle.

The movie is definitely not for everyone.  If you do not like bad language and frank sexual discussions, this is definitely not for you.  If you are bored by movies that contain mostly conversation and are not chock full of action and violence again not for you.  But for a character driven story it is not a bad couple hours to spend.

For those who get the DVD itself, the extras consist of making of and behind the scenes features with the film makers, and a NYC walking tour with Jesse Eisenberg.  There are also a couple different commentary tracks on the film.",1434844800,,1597,4.248344370860927

Although this film isn't just about an Alpha male (in a similar way to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taxi-Driver/dp/B000R8YC18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taxi Driver</a>&nbsp;not just being about psychopaths), it is a dominant thread, and Roger Dodger is a fantastic lead in the mold of James Bond or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brett-Butler/dp/B002M2Z3BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brett Butler</a>.

The one warning attached to this is that, although the film does have some ideas of how to pick up women, it is far more a social commentary on the narcissistic personality that Roger represents. It's kind of like a modern-day&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfie/dp/B000055ZF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfie</a>, but with scenes where Roger takes his virgin cousin to a brothel, amongst other dark scenes.
Still, so long as you can stomach such scenes and see past such faults, you will find a first class charactor film that explores dark themes with artistic finesse.

Last thing to mention is the extras. Occasionally DVD's offer budding film-makers a full tool-kit of how to make a film. The extras on here are one of those treasure-troves and illustrate that the director wasn't just going for offence-for-offence's-sake, but was after something artistic.

So, if you like films with dark themes and want to see an under-rated lead performance, then see this film. You also may be pleasantly surprised by the support role played by Jesse Eisenberg, who went on to play the lead in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Social-Network/dp/B0034G4P7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Social Network</a>.

It's an autumn afternoon in New York City. The workday has just ended. Amid the skyscrapers and congested streets, millions of people going about their business, walking, chatting, working. It is here, among these millions, that we first get a glimpse of the unhappy and tragic person that is Roger Swanson. He is lecturing his young pupil, his nephew Nick, in the art of seducing women. He is somewhat manic, spouting advice at a mile a minute. The lecture is passionate but at the same time almost comical. This grown man supposedly teaching a teenager important lessons in life. Yet as he teaches him how to procure and seduce women, people just walk by him. He is nothing more than a fly on the wall to all those who pass by. On this Manhattan street he is just another frenzied person whose voice is not heard beyond the small space he occupies. I think this is a theme often repeated in Roger Dodger. We see him and Nick go out into the New York City night on their quest for female conquest. Yet at every turn, Roger, who claims to know all the answers, is repeatedly made out to be a nobody. His lover and boss dumps him. His friend at work turns out to be her lover. He is rejected by an engaged woman at a bar. Nick and him do gain the attention of two beautiful women at a lounge. Over time they are intrigued by Nick's innocence and sincerity. However, they become repulsed at Roger's cynicism and simmering anger. He makes advances on one of them only to be rejected again. Finally he loses Nick. In the beginning of the movie Nick looked up to Roger and sought his advice. Nick can barely stand the sight of Roger by the end of their night. All of Roger's loneliness and depression is accentuated by the backdrop of the New York City nightlife. All around him are people having fun at parties, at lounges. His boss finds a new lover. The women he meets at the bar find Nick and are endeared by him. The woman Roger meets at the bar turns out to be waiting for her fiance. Then there is Roger pathetically breaking into his lover's apartment in a jealous rage, crashing a party he is not invited to, taking his nephew to a seedy bordello. At the conclusion of the night he is back to his empty apartment to spend another night alone.
The great thing about this movie is that it takes us beyond what the character pretends to be. Roger has put so much time and energy into creating an image of himself as a suave womanizer and smooth talker. Yet through Campbell Scott's acting and brilliantly crafted dialogue we see into his loneliness and some of the sources of his anger. His ways of trying to seduce women have the opposite affect that he intends. Instead of showcasing confidence and strength, women see him as desperate, angry and hateful. I wonder at the end if Roger can change himself for the better and hope that he can. Yet the final scene, a real risk taker by director Dylan Kidd, leads us to believe that Roger won't kill Roger Dodger. He'll soldier on with it, too proud to come to terms with himself.",1280707200,2,3086,4.42530755711775

1468273,5,B00005JLX8,"Watching Campbell Scott work is magic on this third season of `Damages' (that show is just BRILLIANT) has made me want to review his finest hour, `Roger Dodger'.  This is a film that didn't strike me so much the first time I saw it, but as I sat and thought it over it became evident that this film was something very special.  Oh yeah, Scott's performance is phenomenal (how that NBR win didn't translate to an Oscar nomination is beyond me).

The film has a very simple premise.  Campbell Scott plays Roger Swanson, a successful business man (making his living telling lies) who is a self-proclaimed ladies man who uses his suave yet blunt personality to get himself between any sheets he sets his mind to.  His confidence finds itself shaken when he receives a rejection he wasn't expecting (from his boss no less) and when his nephew shows up at his place of business looking for some attention he finds that his destructive tendencies have casualties outside of his own digression.

I want to make this clear.  The film seems to almost slide ferociously into chaos in the final chapter, and while this may come off rather misplaced, especially when considering the fact that the first three-quarters run much slower and more calculated than the chaotic ending, it is really genius the way that Dylan Kidd uses Roger's own mental breakdown as a catalyst for spinning the films core out of control.

It makes total sense when you put everything on Roger's back.

The film really rides beautifully on the cast.  Sure, there is really only two main character's in play here; Roger and his nephew Nick (Scott and Eisenberg respectively), but Kidd made sure that even the most minute of supporting player is fleshed out with vividly realized performances.  When Roger and Nick pick up two girls in a bar you are instantly drawn into their stories because they are marvelously portrayed (who would ever have thought that Elizabeth Berkley could pull off such a layered and natural performance).  Jesse Eisenberg is a young star I'm not too familiar with (although he has a following now), but this performance is rather remarkable when you really analyze it.  He never allows the weight of the eventualities to ware at him, and he evokes an awkward confidence that beautifully contrasts the arrogant swagger of his uncle.  I love Isabella Rossellini, and she is astonishing here as well (she plays off of Scott's aggressive nature flawlessly).

And then there is Campbell Scott.  I mean, this performance is just downright flawless.  I don't even know what to say.  The way he taps into this mans seething realities is just unprecedented.  I love how he reveals his character's glitches in the way he shifts his eyes, like when Nick is revealing issues at home, he almost instinctively feels compelled to act yet his ingrained persona kicks in and he dispels all emotion.  The downward and chaotic spiral of degradation at the films climax is just another glimpse into this man's bitter unhappiness.

And here is the kicker; the film never addresses it outright, which I think is GEEEE-NEEEE-US!

Like I said, when the film ended I was left scratching my head for a bit.  I was thrown off by the sudden and drastic shift in tone, and then the ending `almost' seemed like a copout, but as I reflecting on the film and watched it a few more times I found that it all strangely feels so appropriate.

Certainly one of the best films of 2002, and Campbell Scott's performance is one of the best of the decade, easy!",1266451200,3,3509,4.752475247524752
1468323,5,B00005JLX8,"Roger Swanson(Campbell Scott) knows women. He knows what makes them tick, why they are the way they are; from the way they wear their hair, the shoes they picked out or the look in their eyes. Roger has mastered the art of knowing women, what they think they're hiding deep down; and he blows his own horn about the very fact quite masterfully, and frequently. When his boss Joyce(Isabella Rossellini) breaks off their secret affair, Roger is angered and convinced she will change her mind and return immediately to his highly intelligent self.

A wrench gets thrown into Roger's routine when his 16 year old nephew Nick(Jesse Eisenberg) shows up in his office, hoping to spend some quality time with his absent uncle.  Nick's your typical high school outcast, inexperienced, shy and naive; the complete opposite of his uncle Roger. So when Nick asks his uncle to teach him how he acquires the attention of so many women, he just might not be ready for the abstract knowledge that is about to spew from Roger's salacious unconscious.

""You drink that drink! Alcohol has been a social lubricant for thousands of years. What do you think, you're going to sit here tonight and reinvent the wheel?""

After bombarding young Nick with a truly brilliant monologue on the ravenous city streets, we find this twosome in a bar where Roger hits Nick with the nights' first challenge; converse with two beautiful older women Andrea(Elizabeth Berkley) and Sophie(Jennifer Beals) on the premise that they've made a bet for a thousand dollars; that Nick cannot get a woman to fall in love with him that very night.

This movie has its awkward moments, sometimes I just wanted to yell at little Nick(""get out of there! I feel embarrassed for you!"") and the reoccurring music is a little on the cheesy side, but overall this film is very intelligent.

Campbell Scott is brilliant as Roger, although the cast is great, he alone carries this film to a new level entirely. His ongoing rants and insight into the female mystique, not to mention his arrogance should really make us dislike him, but something in his portrayal is too sincere, and we see when the tables are turned that even Roger can be hurt.

I commend this film and it's ability to juxtapose it's two main characters so beautifully, leaving so many questions to be asked. Is it better to be overly aware, or blissfully ignorant? Does your heart break any more when it's happened so many times, and you have the ability to see it coming?

I have known guys that slowly drifted into seeking to stroke their egos by sleeping with anybody they could and acting like they were WAY COOLER than they actually were.  That is why this portrayal is so amazing.  It takes a lot for an actor to portray such a polarizing character this well.  This is truly a great film for lovers of great acting.

Some people may relate to this character and find his desperation and antics funny.  Others may be revolted by his personality.  I am more in the second camp.  One thing is for certain, this role was nailed by the lead actor, Campbell Scott.

The Story and the Script

Roger's character is manipulative, egotistical and yet obviously trying to compensate for something.  He has an affair with his boss, played by Isabella Rossallini.  Yet it's really more like she uses him till she tires of him.  As he drifts from bar to bar trying to pick up women with transparent and conceited attempts to seem intelligent and observant, we get to see just how clueless, pathetic and desperate he really is.  Oh yeah, this is a NY city story for sure!

When his nephew Nick comes to the city for college interviews, Roger takes him to many places where he shouldn't be.  Roger revels in feeling like he has a lot to teach young Nick about women, yet Nick seems to do better just being himself instead of using Roger's sleazy tactics.  While I won't give away the entire plot, suffice it to say it's not the story but rather the performances that impress.
In many ways, the supporting cast in particular seems to have been given sparse lines.  Yet the acting and direction are so good that the script is perfectly supported.
The Cast

Campbell Scott really opened my eyes with his portrayal of Roger.  Somehow he was able to really capture and portray the complicated mix of negative and positive character traits.

Jesse Eisenberg is very impressive, but his part was clearly written in a way that makes it easier to play than Roger's.  Isabella Rossallini is wonderful as always.

Yet the roles played by Elizabeth Berkeley and Jennifer Beals are perfect examples of why this film works.  On the one hand, they have minimal roles with few lines.  Yet the close camera work allows you to see so many non-verbal cues in their faces and gestures.  Their roles are minimal, yet highly impactful because of the way they are executed.  Roger's co-workers by and large have similarly understated yet effective roles.

Conclusion

I highly recommend this movie to actors and lovers of independent film.  If you are a huge fan of dialogue and sharp wit, you will find yourself pulled in to this movie.  Definitely check it out.

The story revolves around Rodger (Campbell Scott), an egotistic, insecure, overly analytical wordsmith who has just been dumped by his female boss (Isabella Rossellini). His sixteen year old nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) unexpectedly shows up in his office and Roger decides to break the young boy in 'New York Style.' Prepare for a crash course in how to pick up a woman as taught in the sometimes alluring, often times sleazy world of Uncle Roger, the proverbial lounge lizard.

Dialogue is everything in this film and most of it comes from the incredibly glib and searing tongue of the recently scorned Roger who has yet to learn how to deal with rejection. Roger is the self-proclaimed prophet of the ""Gender Wars"" and is determined to teach his naive nephew how to cope with the opposite sex.

Then his 16 yr. old nephew enters the picture & asks for help with the ladies. Normally he might not ""waste"" his time in helping another human being, but I believe it creates a nice distraction from the current turbulation in his life.

They interact with a couple of chicks at a bar, Elizabeth Berkley who I enjoy & Jennifer Beals who I find highly overrated. They like the boy's naivetivity. Scott then continues the night trying to get the boy laid while the night gets seamier & seamier. There is definitely some truthfullness in this movie, such as when Scott tells his nephew about the closing time scenario in which everyone gets depressed & just don't want to be alone. In the end it seems that the nephew may have learned a thing or 2 even though he'd probably retain his sweetness. Scott may or may not change, but I think it's more about the scene & lonliness than any one or 2 characters. This film really does seem to push you into the movie.

Scott's character is an accomplished and dedicated player who never sees the wrong in his ways and that is the delicious and honest part of the film. One review talked about the player venting his anger at women but my take was that he stayed in control the entire movie, venting naturally (and within limits) when he was thrown over by his boss/lover. Like him or hate him, the player is a pro from beginning to end. The viewer has to decide whether he likes or dislikes women.

After he is dumped by his lover, who happens to be his boss, Roger returns to his office at work and finds his nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) standing there, waiting.  With a little bit of prompting, Roger takes Nick out on the town with the intent on teaching Nick about women and to help Nick with his first ""conquest"".  What we have is a mixing of Nick's hesitant, nervous innocence with Roger's scorn, confidence, and perhaps even distaste for women as anything but an object to acquire.
Considering what the subject matter is, I did not expect to like this movie very much.  I was surprised.  The dialogue is sharp, and it is easy to see why this movie was produced, the screenplay must have been a real gem to find.  Visually, ""Roger Dodger"" is not much to look at, but the performances and the dialogue help it to rise above what it could have been.  ""Roger Dodger"" also co-stars Isabella Rossellini and Elizabeth Berkley.

Full of attitude, this is a no compromise piece of work.
A fair critism, would be to say that the camera work is very shake quite a lot of the time, the use of what seems handheld camera is almost amateurish, and made me feel a bit sea sick, as it shakes around as you watch the scene.
No doubt a low budget , and not A rate camera operator are to blame here.
A real shame, as with 1st class lighting and camerwork, this couldve been even better.
Very original, not just a tarantino rip-off, but genuine and stark views that must've been held by the writer.

The dialogue is bland and labored, and it just felt like it was trying to be TOO smart and TOO important or something. Like I said, I guess I just don't get it.

1468471,4,B00005JLX8,"If you like movies about New York scenes and that make social commentaries on these scenes, I definitely recommend this one. Roger Swanson, a fast-talkin' yuppie advertising copyrighter and slick ladies' man, the ""player"" type of guy you often come across in singles bars and dating services, is very easy to detest at first. His way of seducing ladies is the same formula he applies to his job: get them to feel bad about themselves, and then present himself as the man who will ""save"" them from their predicaments. After he eats lunch with his boss and co-workers, he uses this method when he makes remarks to a young female co-worker that she's sleeping with her boss, and insults an older woman by accusing her of being a pathetic self-help junkie who was in a string of abusive relationships before she finally found her fiance, warning her that her fiance might dump her once he finds out how old she really is. Not surprisingly, these women recoil from him in disgust. ""Do you want me to call the bartender?"" the latter woman says to him. His boss (Isabella Rosselini), who he's been sleeping with, gets fed up with him after he let himself into her apartment using a copy of her keys that he had made without telling her.

One day at the office - just after his boss dumped him - Nick, his teenaged nephew, pays him a surprise visit at his cubicle. They eat lunch at a nearby coffee shop, and Nick tells Roger that he heard from his mother that Roger is a ladies' man, and he wants Roger to teach him how to attract women. Roger happily obliges, taking Nick out on a night on the town to show him the ropes. They first stop at a club, where they meet two young women named Andrea (Elizabeth Berkley) and Sophie (Jennifer Beals), and get into long conversations about relationships with families - we discover that Nick's mother is a closet alcoholic and Roger didn't get along with his father - and losing your virginity. Andrea and Sophie are charmed by Nick's intelligence, youth, and lack of artifice, but turned off by Roger's boorish behavior.

Next, Nick and Roger crash his boss's party, even though she didn't invite him. Nick, egged on by Roger, attempts to lose his virginity with a guest who has had too much drink and is passed out on a bed, while Roger circulates with the guests, talking a mile a minute, putting everything and everyone down, until he runs into his boss and the co-workers he ate lunch with earlier and makes insinuating remarks about his boss sleeping with a much younger co-worker. His boss tells him to leave and that he is fired. ""Think very carefully about what you're doing,"" she admonishes him. Roger then takes Nick to an underground brothel, and all hell breaks loose between them as Roger realizes that he might have gone too far in corrupting Nick's morals. They make up later on.

By then, even though you cannot sympathize with Roger, you do see how sad, lonely, and alienated he truly is. Even though he's a smooth, glib talker, he's really a buffoon. It is clear that he is unable to relate to people, female or male, and has a lot of frustrations about this. This is because he has never grown up, and everybody else - his boss, his co-workers, etc. - sees this but him.  Only Nick - who in many ways turns out to be much more mature than his uncle - retains some affection for Roger; in spite of everything, Nick feels he did learn something from his uncle. This is evident when Roger visits Nick in the cafeteria of his high school in Ohio and coaches him and his friends - a couple of whom think Roger is ""strange, but cool"" - on how to attract women.

I thought this film was a good social commentary about shallow, narcissistic people in the dating scene, and the sad, empty lives they lead. They seem very charming and charismatic at first, but once you really know them, you're grateful you're not like them.",1066694400,4,3870,4.522857142857143
1468472,4,B00005JLX8,"I wouldn't have thought from previews that ""Roger Dodger"" would have an ounce of romance in it, but it does.  The scene between Elizabeth Berkeley, Jennifer Beals (both very good by the way--who would have thought?) and Roger's nephew is incredibly sweet and touching, but without being overly sentimental or cloying.  Campbell Scott gives a fabulous performance as Roger, illustrating how broad his acting range is.
My only complaint with the movie is its incredibly annoying cinematography.  All of the compositions are cluttered and claustrophobic, sometimes so much so that the main focus of the shot is entirely obscured.  And this trend toward hand-held cameras needs to be stopped.  I think directors feel that hand-held cinematography lends a gritty, realistic point of view to their films, but more frequently it serves only to distract.
But a fairly minor quibble about an otherwise very good film.

1468473,4,B00005JLX8,"You are immediately drawn into this from the start with Roger's quirky monologue to his friends at a restaurant about his theories on human evolution - it sounds like anti-social crap but he exudes enough charisma to get away with it, in fact his friends give him a round of applause at the end of these ramblings such is the conviction of his delivery. Is he a total jerk or jaded city guy with a heart of gold? That is pretty much the question that lingers over him the whole time you watch this film.
When his 16 year old virginal nephew arrives on the scene asking for tips on how to pick up girls Roger is given a chance to flex his mysoginistic side which he relishes. Enough said on the story, what I liked about this film was that it is one of the few I have seen where the characters are genuinely believable and respond to situations as you would expect real people to. This is what hold yours attention as there are significantly long periods of meandering dialogue in Roger Dodger between the action and drama that unfolds. Also, the director doesn't impose himself on the characters or scenes, instead he leaves it up to the viewer to soak it all in and draw their own conclusions, this is helped by the way it is filmed, the camera moving around casually, sometimes jerkily as though you are eavesdropping in on Roger's interludes with people. It's a certain stylization which isn't overpowering but works well in tandem with Roger's urgent, manic, sometimes infuriating character.",1063324800,3,1495,4.602996254681648
1468474,4,B00005JLX8,"Roger Swanson is a coldhearted, fast-talking yuppie businessman who has cynically reduced the man-woman equation to its Darwinian essentials.  To Roger, women are objects to be conquered not people to be respected, and he has learned to employ his good looks, charm and over-analytical mind in the service of getting laid.  When Nick, his nave, inexperienced 16-year old nephew comes to town, Roger decides to train the boy in the fine art of manipulation and seduction, taking him out for a night on the town that the youngster will not soon forget.
As conceived by first time writer/director Dylan Kidd, ""Roger Dodger"" is less a full-fledged narrative and more a series of extended conversations.  And I, for one, couldn't be happier, for the dialogue Kidd has come up with is sharp, observant, insightful and witty, as Roger opens up and reveals his unique perspective on the dating scene.  He uses his mouth like a machine gun, shooting rounds of rapid-fire, staccato comments, indifferent to who's left standing when he's done.  He really has no qualms about ""corrupting"" his underage nephew, never seeing or caring about the corrosive effect he may be having on him.  In the process, we learn quite a bit about Roger as a person, most especially the aloofness he feels from others and his inability to make any kind of emotional connection that really works.  Long estranged from his father and sister, Roger is also facing a breakup with the older woman he's recently come to fancy (his boss in fact).  Roger is a humorous figure but also an immensely sad one, for he really does seem - for all his bravado and bluster to the contrary - to be a lonely, unhappy guy.  We are simultaneously drawn to him by his confidence and charisma and repelled by his smarminess and coldness, just like the characters in the film.  As Roger, Campbell Scott does a superb job bringing out both of those seemingly contradictory qualities.  A non-stop talker, Roger knows how to draw all the attention in the room to himself; he is (at the risk of mixing my metaphors here) like a chattering vortex up there on the screen and we can't help but be sucked in by his personality and presence.  No wonder Scott won the 2002 award for Best Actor from the National Board of Review.  In fact, I haven't seen a performance this smooth, alive and energetic in a very long time.  Equally impressive is young Jesse Eisenberg whose wide-eyed innocence and youthful decency provide an effective counterpoint to the brash but empty Roger.  Isabella Rossellini, Elizabeth Berkley and Jennifer Beals also turn in outstanding performances as the various ladies who play a part in the two men's adventure.
In his debut film, Kidd shows himself to be in full control of his medium.  He employs a jittery, handheld camera in almost every scene, a technique that may bother some people but which heightens the sense of realism so essential to the nature of the story.  In this way, the audience is made to feel almost like an eavesdropper on the various conversations.  Kidd should also be commended - in this day of maximum special effects and minimal verbiage - for allowing his characters to speak at great length on any number of topics.  Many another filmmaker would have felt intimidated by such a heavy reliance on dialogue.  Kidd, obviously, feels intoxicated by the beauty of language and his intoxication becomes ours.
Roger is a fascinating case study mainly because we feel so ambivalent in our attitude towards him.  Just as we are about to consign him to the category of heartless, cold-blooded bastard, he wins us over by showing us that barest glimmer of humanity that peeks out every so often from beneath his well-oiled exterior.

1468476,4,B00005JLX8,"This is not a brilliantly insightful movie.  It is a comedy, pure and simple.  Though there are many cynical witticisms made by the title character Roger (Campbell Scott) in the opening 20 minutes and it seems like the movie is about to carry on in that fashion for its entirety, the movie redeems itself from appealing to a very limited audience (which I would have been a part of anyway) as soon as Roger's nephew Nick enters the film.
The movie begins a comically candid introduction to the mind of an average male.  Of course, Nick believes that there are other motivations at play in the male mind and has difficulty adapting to his uncle's world.
The film's brand of humour is somewhat immature, but so is mine.  I found it suprisingly entertaining considering its small budget.  Women have to understand that the film is not trying to offend women.  Watch it through to the end to see what I'm talking about.

Shaky camera technique? More like: give a camera to a 3 year old. No, if they had done that it might have even been worth watching. I would be embarressed to call myself a cinematographer (or director) on this shoot. The incessant dialog wasn't even the bulk of the problem. I was so put off by the (lack of) ""camera work,"" and lighting that I immediately disliked everyone on the shaking screen.
Maybe I missed an opportunity to see a good film -- if only I could have stuck it out. Well, why should I? I guess they wanted to break the rules of good fimmaking. And they did. For me, they drew all the attention from the characters and placed it solely on the camera.
I readily admit I couldn't stomach this movie beyond the first few minutes, so I may not be the best one to judge it.

After the smartly written opening scene though, I was pleasantly surprised and I was on board for the rest of the film. At the risk of contradicting myself, I normally don't like dialouge driven independent film, particularly set in an urban setting such as Manhattan. Nothing against NYC, it's just they tend to confuse pontification and philosophy as substance for character. However the writer/director manages to get his ideas across with out preaching, making for a highly watchable film. There is a slight pretension to this movie, but only because it is encapsulated in the main character, Roger, played brilliantly by Campbell Scott. I've always liked watching Scott and he does not dissappoint. He gives a performance that will hopefully get him noticed again. And it's balanced wonderfully by Jesse Eisenberg, who plays his nephew that looks to Roger to educate him in manners of the opposite sex.
The other thing that I liked about this film is the pace. This is ""A Night in the Life"" premise but it moves quickly and you really don't realize your watching that type of movie until after it's over. The hook that keeps you watching is not only Scotts performance, but wondering if the nephew is going to lose his virginity.
The only critizism I have of the film is that it's shot entirely hand held. The style lends itself well to the film, but I would love to see what this director does with a steadycam.
You don't ""Gotta see this movie!"" but it's an intellegent distraction with a unique charm. And a great film for those who like New York stories. A good addition to a library.",1054598400,30,1687,4.702702702702703

Campbell Scott shows that he's got his father's acting skills as he plays a womanizer who's showing his nephew that ""Sex is all around you"" in New York. And Elizabeth Berkeley! She actually redeemed herself for Showgirls in this movie.

1468551,4,B00005JLX8,"Quentin Tarantino is the most recent director who taught us the importance of a good opening scene for a movie, through classics such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.
Dylan Kidd appears to be a very capable student, opening his directorial debut, titled Roger Dodger, with a remarkable scene, a dialogue that actually turns into a monologue of our lead character. In that scene, Roger (Campbell Scott), a successful advertiser and probably equally successful womanizer, states why, according to his beliefs, men will become totally unnecessary for women in the very near future.
After such a strong intro, it is a challenge for every director to keep the attention of the viewer at the same level for the rest of the way. Still, Kidd seems to be up to the task, giving us a really absorbing movie. Be warned though: Roger Dodger is a dialogue driven movie. There is not much action here.
The film gets started when Roger's nephew (Jesse Eisenberg) suddenly visits, and asks Roger to tell him about the secrets of love - or, if you prefer, to help him get his first sexual experience. Roger will accept the challenge, promising a ""fail safe"" method, and a long night will begin. Their ride includes a visit to a bar where two attractive but also willing to talk women (Elizabeth Berkley, Jennifer Beals) are added to their company, an (uninvited) visit to a party by Roger's employer and ex-girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini), who has made perfectly clear that she does not want to socialize with him any more, and a final surprise visit, where the climax of the film is set.
Most of the film's dialogues regard sex and the relations between men and women. Roger's philosophy in advertising is to humiliate people, make them feel bad about themselves, and then offer some kind of product to ""cure"" their unhappiness. In real life, his philosophy is not much different. At least in the first half. Being totally cynical, he won't hesitate to degrade others not taking into consideration their feelings. In some cases, this tactic will give him an advantage, allowing him to find others unprepared and manipulate their weaknesses. In other cases though, things are not that sunny... On the other hand, his nephew, probably because he is still young and inexperienced in life, expresses views that are much more honest and romantic. This, has Roger, his presumable mentor, waiting on the sidelines, not being able to do much.
Campbell Scott, who plays Roger, is absolutely convincing. He says all his lines without trying too much. He also shows a considerable amount of charm, which makes him likable, even if we know that this in not the correct reaction toward a character like his. From the supporting roles, only Elizabeth Berkley (Saved by the bell if I remember correctly) is not totally up to the rest cast's high standards, having a tendency to goggle her eyes way too often.
Kidd's direction is live, with a penetrating camera that is in constant motion, like the eyes of its main character. That would probably tire a few viewers, but in my humble opinion, fits perfectly with the film's atmosphere.
If we would like to locate weaknesses in Roger Dodger, those have nothing to do with the views of our main character. As a matter of fact, Kidd comments indirectly about them, by giving us a glimpse of Roger's personal life. The problem is that the film is concentrated too much on the dialogue, not giving much of a chance to its characters to develop satisfactorily as complete human beings. And that is the case even for Roger. We get to hear a few things about his family, which, if further analyzed, would probably explain his behavior. Still, all those references are left there hanging. And that's a pity.
In any case, we forgive Roger because he managed to win us from the opening minute!",1052697600,10,3804,4.818042813455658
1468552,4,B00005JLX8,"...somehow it just misses the ""exceptional"" category.  The camera work and cinematography are flawless, the dialogue is razor-sharp and often bitingly insightful, the music is superb, the actors are well-cast and well-directed.  There are no glaring flaws or shortcomings...and even though I was certainly absorbed, entertained, and even had a few light bulb moments, when it was over I just wasn't completely satisfied. If ""Roger Dodger"" were food, I'd want to add a lot of garlic or chillis or salt or SOMETHING to put more of an *OOOOH* into it.
A note to those who are taken in by the advertising blurb claiming that this is a Cassanova's Handbook sort of movie: it isn't.  Campbell's character doesn't really show his nephew all that much about what comprises successful womanizing; he only gives the boy a glimpse into his own hit-and-miss attempts therein.  Meaning he's really a wannabe womanizer, further along than most because he's an excellent talker with zero self-consciousness, but still fails because women still see through him and cringe away.  A truly masterful womanizer gets seen through all the time but gets away with it anyway; the women he picks up knows they're being conned---and don't give a damn.
That said, before seeing this I had almost forgotten just how drop-dead gorgeous Jennifer Beals truly is...that raises its score from 3-1/2 starts to 4!",1051401600,5,1378,5.079646017699115
1468553,4,B00005JLX8,"Roger Dodger is a sharp, insightful and often funny study of a man who is too smooth for his own good. We first meet Roger (Campbell Scott, in a superb role) entertaining a group of friends over cocktails; he dominates the conversation with a clever but absurd argument on the future roles of the sexes. Roger's monologue on the impending irrelevance of the male sex suggests right off the bat that this would-be womanizer suffers from an inferiority complex. As the film progresses, we see that Roger is never out of character; he is always ""on,"" whether at his job (appropriately enough, he's an advertising copyrighter) or trying to seduce a woman. If there is an inner core to this quintessential single, big city pick-up artist, we never see it. The problem is, Roger's smooth, cynical style doesn't really work; more often than not, he offends rather than impresses. This is made clear when he tries to woo a woman in a bar away from her date by guessing that she is being used and exploited by her womanizing boss. This is only a minor conversation in the film, but it takes on an ironic meaning when we learn that the girlfriend who recently dumped Roger (played by Isabella Rossellini) is his boss. We start to suspect at this point that Roger, despite his suave persona, is more victim than predator. When Roger's sixteen year old nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) arrives in town, Roger sees an opportunity to vicariously test his techniques. Nick is a sensitive and somewhat shy teenager anxious for sexual experience; he naively believes Roger to be an expert in this area. When Roger and Nick go out on the town to meet women, the results are often tragically comic. The limited success they have is due to Nick's charm rather than Roger's off-putting worldliness. One of the best things about Roger Dodger is that it avoids falling into some obvious cliches. Writer/director Dylan Kidd could have, for example, turned the story into a neat reversal where the innocent but wiser Nick teaches Roger about the true meaning of love. At the conclusion, it's less than clear who has learned what or if anyone has drastically changed. Campbell Scott avoids making Roger into a complete caricature. While he is certainly slimy and superficial, he is not wrong about everything. It's worth noting that some of the good impressions made by Nick could not have been achieved without Roger's bravado. The film's final scene, in which Roger talks to Nick and some of his high school friends, perfectly encapsulates Roger and the film. We are left with the feeling that Nick, though too smart to put Roger on a pedestal, has probably learned a thing or two from him all the same.",1050019200,4,2676,4.769396551724138

The more I think back on it, the more I end up liking this movie.  The very underrated Campbell Scott pulls off a brilliant performance.  And it's hard to believe this is the debut of first-time director Dylan Kidd.  His script is polished and very sharp.  And although the picture is mostly dark, the colors are really vibrant.  I don't agree with the shaky-cam (a technique Kidd says he'll go to his grave defending), but I wasn't nearly distracted by it either.
So, the movie's good...but the DVD makes it a must-own.  So many DVD's today are loaded with trashy promotional featurettes--nothing that really tells about how the movie was made.  ""Roger Dodger"" does a whole lot better.  The special features are introduced by director Kidd calling it a kind-of film-school-in-a-box.  Interviews abound with all the faculty from Executive Producer to music and sound to casting director and more.  Also included is the trailer, a tip sheet for picking up women (repeated here from the movie), 2 audio commetaries, and a deleted scene with optional commentary.  The one throw-away feature is a guided tour of the New York locations from the movie.  A real good idea for a feature gets wasted here when the hosts (actors from the movie) turn it into 10 minutes of goofing off (and no, it's not funny).  Overall, a 4-star movie, a 5-star DVD.",1049932800,2,1553,4.721189591078067
1468555,4,B00005JLX8,".... with Roger Dodger is like spending a night with a ""player"": you feel slimed, angered, bewildered, and entertained, at the same time.  By the end of the film, you want to take a shower and crawl into bed to get some rest.
The Roger of the title is a womanizing scumball brainiac whose speech is as highly controlled as his love life is absolutely out of control. This shark loves the ladies, to a fault; by mentally assassinating them before making any kind of move, he ruins his chances continuously. You can see this routine might of work with younger, unsuspecting college girls, but as Roger is aging, the act is failing. Ironically, his nephew shows up to seek advice about the ladies, so Roger spends most of the film poisioning this young lad's mind about the ways of the love world, possibly validating the claim: ""Those who can't anymore, teach.""
Roger is expertly played by Campbell Scott, a highly undervalued actor in cinema today. He walks the fine line between making Roger just scumbag enough to abhor him, and brings a remarkable vulnerability to him at the right times. Equally compelling is Jennifer Beals as a temporary seductress to nephew Nick, and yes, Elizabeth Berkley shines (it's time we get over Showgirls). The successful script, combined with the great cast, make for a great movie experience.
One problem I have is with the overuse of the ""shaky camera"", which the filmmakers immediately defend in their commentary and bonus features tracks. When I first saw ""Roger Dodger"" in the theater, I almost felt, fearing motion sickness with the shaky cam. But soon, I fell into it and didn't notice it as much. At home, the reaction is similiar, but somehow, more jarring. Some scenes are almost unwatchable with the shakiness.  I appreciate the reason why they chose that method, but find it to take away from the impact of some scenes. ""Shaky cam"" is okay, but sometimes, this is ""earthquake cam"".
Overall, Roger Dodger carries well. As secrets are revealed at the end, and the real truth comes out, it somehow seems right. Kudos for this bravera film, and looking for more from this cinematic team in the future.",1049587200,4,2142,4.786486486486487
1468556,4,B00005JLX8,"Roger Dodger starts out as a dark comedy with witty dialogue and excellent acting, and for the most part, not much changes for the rest of the film.  The dialogue stays just as witty, the acting equally as good, (Campbell Scott is tremedous as Roger, a man who thinks he knows everything there is to know about women), and the movie just as enjoable.  But the comdey sort of fades away, and we begin to discover just how sad and lonely Roger really is.
  The directing is very interesting.  Shaky, up-close camera angles make up this entire movie.  In fact, the camera almost never zooms out for a 'master shot', and the filmmakers talk about this is the DVD extras.
  This movie is really worth seeing for Campbell Scott's performance alone, but beyond that it really is a good rental, and it is recommended.",1049500800,3,809,4.569444444444445
1468557,4,B00005JLX8,"The fast-paced, talky, intelligent ""Roger Dodger"" will prove to be a delight for some viewers. Others may find it abrasive and more than a little offensive. Whatever one's viewpoint, it's hard to deny that Roger Swanson is one memorable character.
Roger [Campbell Scott] is a very successful writer at a New York advertising agency. As he puts is, his job is to get people buy things by making them feel bad about themselves. Shrew, fast-talking Roger long ago learned to use the same technique on women. When he meets one he wants, he sizes her up, then begins to say things designed to make her feel that her life needs something. That something is Roger.
The bulk of the movie takes place over the course of a day and a night when Roger's manipulative, self-centered world begins to crumble. His latest conquest [Isabella Rossellini], who is also his boss, unceremoniously dumps him in a hilarious scene which shows the great inroads women have made in what used to be exclusively male territory. Then Nick [Jesse Eisenberg], the 16-year old son of his estranged sister in Ohio, shows up. An unexpected bond develops between the two, and soon Roger begins to show the eager lad his technique for getting women. What follows is a series of escapades in which both guys, for better or worse, gets far more than he bargains for.
Though the movie takes place in a big city, guys like Roger exist everywhere, and we've all met at least one of them. They are frequently well educated and materially successful, but emotionally they are stuck in their teens. No wonder Roger bonds with Nick. Their maturity levels are about the same.
The underrated Scott gives perhaps his best performance to date as pathetic Roger. Eisenberg is touching as the sensitive Nick. The entire supporting cast, which includes Rossellini, Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Berkley, does a fine job.
""Roger Dodger"" is a low budget movie. It suffers from some rather shaky hand-held camera work. Despite its technical flaws, it is a highly entertaining character study.",1048550400,3,2036,4.88728323699422
1468558,4,B00005JLX8,"The first feature from director Dylan Kidd is a knockout. Campbell Scott was a brilliant stroke of casting and made the movie. Perfect choice.
In addition to the wonderful movie are the extras which make the DVD worth double the price. Kidd does a wonderful 'over, under and through' of the movie and is an audio track that shouldn't be missed. In addition the actors have an audio-go as well and a number of shorts explore the movie from all different vantage points. Great collection of extras.
My only complaint, and it might be my DVD equipment, but this DVD caused my laser to whirr non-stop. I have not heard laser grinding on my machine like that since I put in an independent, small label, european DVD a couple of months ago which ultimately didn't play (and no it wasn't porno!). It might be the programming on the DVD but who knows?
So if you got it put a bag of ice on the ol' machine before having a go at this movie. But grinding or no grinding it is worth a look.",1048550400,,978,4.3497267759562845

7939550,5,B00005JLX8,Loved this movie. Just didn't understand how Rodger was such a player yet  he was so attached to his boss that looked like she was in her 60's. Consistency wise it didn't add up but still thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Good little coming of age flick. Wish nick was apart of the first half of the movie.,1510099200,,302,4.298245614035087
7939551,4,B00005JLX8,"This was a very interesting film. It was great drama and all of the performances were spot on! What it lacked was a bit of clarity. Despite this, all of the characters are realistic. If I met them in real life I could see them actually existing.

Roger seems to be a bit of an arrogant prick. He's the kind of jerk that women love to hate yet they always end up dating guys like him because of his intense confidence and arrogance too! He's the kind of man we all wish we could be. Roger knows what it takes to get a woman but he does not know what it takes to keep one which explains his lack of a wedding ring. The fact that he dates his boss (Very, Very Dangerous For A Man To Do) and crashes her party when not invited (Not To Mention Making A Scene In Her Apartment Lobby) shows that he likes to live dangerously. Despite this he is cool and a man we all want to be.

When his nephew arrives, Roger shows the kid the ropes. The kid is a wet behind the ears lad who has no idea on how to relate to girls. But Roger shows him a night he'll never forget. He buys him alcohol and he gives him pointers on how to flirt and talk with girls. The kid even gets a soul kiss by a hot chick played by Elizabeth Berkley! Wow! What a lucky kid! But Roger, a bit drunk, alienates the ladies and they end up leaving in a huff. Later that night Roger takes the kid to an underground whorehouse. It's assumed that Roger has been there to partake in the ladies himself at some point in his past.

This was a solid drama and I liked it. Rodger has flaws, like trying to get his nephew to take advantage of a drunk girl (Rape Her) while she's passed out and inebriated. He also takes the kid to bars and underground brothels. Any one of which would be  stretching things but both in one night is out of the question. I'm the 136th person to review this film. I'm glad that my friend lent it to me because it's a film I ended up enjoying greatly. I give this film Four Stars. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.",1505001600,,1997,4.0353535353535355

 I had never heard of this film and watched it only because I want to watch all of Jesse Eisenberg's films.  Writer/Director/Producer Dylan Kidd made this film when Eisenberg had attained only his 18th birthday.  This was Eisenberg's very first feature film and it did bring him to the attention of the professionals in the business.  He plays a 16 year old high school kid from Ohio visiting NYC who has a night out with his uncle Roger, a cynical advertising man and womanizer played with passionless brutality and subtle saving grace by Campbell Scott.  Both Scott and Eisenberg turn in brilliant portrayals.
  Dylan Kidd made this small and very smart and surprisingly deep film on a very small but unknown budget.  He used hand held cameras which did not in this case detract from the enjoyment of the film in the least.  He also wrote the script which right from the opening shows an urbane sophistication that made the movie.  His Roger has developed a winning system for seduction that serves him well.  Roger is a man with depths to him who seems satisfied with many but very shallow relationships.  He disgusts us with his manipulative cynicism and just when we have had entirely enough of Roger Dodger he shows us a flicker of the deeper man.
  We also have the enormous talent of Isabella Rossellini who plays the employer and lover of Roger.  Jennifer Beals (Book of Eli, The White Orchid) appears in what is also her first feature film.  Watch for the now famous Morena Baccrin in a brief scene as Girl in Bar.
  Dylan Kidd as writer, director and producer showed great promise with this bright little film.  It swept up a dozen awards.  Kidd has not as yet been able to translate his talent into a bigger success.  This film, worthy as it may be, brought in less than two million dollars in theatrical release.  It runs for one hour and 26 minutes.  The 2002 film has an R rating for language and subject matter.",1482019200,,1945,4.606413994169096
