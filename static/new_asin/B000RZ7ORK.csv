He is one of the most transparent, and godliest speakers I have ever had the privilege to listen to!
and because he has such as straight lace personality, you can't help but, laugh at the humor. This is a video how he got along in Papa New Guinea with the natives that stole his pineapples and anything else that belonged to him.
He was a missionary to these people. He shows you how he conquered anger and frustration to show these people that God does love them.
If you don't believe in God or if you do,,, I encourage you to get this video. You will be so blessed by it!",1186272000,5,758,4.128378378378378
