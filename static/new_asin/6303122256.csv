7838127,5,6303122256,"This tape contains half a dozen short clay animation  films.  I bought this because of my interest in stop-motion animation since childhood.  It has some very well produced examples of claymation.

I recall seeing one of them, ""Fast Food,"" (using the comedy soundtrack of Stevens and Grdnic) at a Star Trek convention in the early '90s, and the whole crowd was laughing.  Most of the other's here aren't as funny but still great imaginative animation, including Allan Sherman's ""Good Advice"" featuring the comedian's famous funny singing. Also included are ""Bumble Boogie,"" ""Jamaica No Problem,"" and assorted Lost Leaders, very short films.

Over all about as enjoyable as George Pal's Puppetoons, though for more modern tastes.  I recommend it for any claymation fan or anyone learning to animate.",1230681600,,798,5.2362204724409445
