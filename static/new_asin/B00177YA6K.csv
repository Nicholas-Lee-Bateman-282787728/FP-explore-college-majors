3168405,3,B00177YA6K,"I thought the acting left a little to be desired but it was still a cute family movie. It is nice to watch these type of movies sometimes even if you don't have a family. I am such a dog person it was hard to hold back tears at times when the dad seemed so insensitive towards the dog when the rest of the family had fallen in love with it. It was great seeing Garrett Morris, the former SNL star back in the day, again. I hadn't seen him in anything for many, many years.",1227916800,,472,3.9270833333333335
3168406,5,B00177YA6K,"Fun summer movie (if its not summer when you watch it, it will make you look forward to next summer when things warm up again). Really is great for the whole family to watch. I loved how this one loveable dog managed to bring a whole family together. Everything from the workaholic father to the lonely son to the difficult teenage daughter - this one cute dog brings them all together again as a family. Entertaining for people of all ages!",1225324800,6,441,4.45679012345679

The first five minutes might be slightly scary (just because of the music, and it's dark, and noises are unknown at the time).  After that, PERFECT.",1223596800,3,279,4.56

3168419,5,B00177YA6K,I have more dog movies than anything. I simply love dogs. I had a Rhodesian Ridgeback/Pitbull mix and he was a BIG baby. I am always looking for new dog DVD's that I don't already have. Thank you!,1363564800,,196,4.184210526315789
3168420,5,B00177YA6K,I just watched Frank on netflix and seeing the low price on amazon I went ahead and bought it. This movie is such a great family movie. I loved the dogs that played Frank and the whole feel of the movie was awesome! I would highly recommend this movie to all dog lovers. I also loved the Native American shop and the home town feel. I loved the cabin and the beautiful property they had there and the canoe rides with the kids. Ok.. lets just say I loved everything about it but some of the sad stuff they put in as they always do but as you know it all works out in the end. Enjoy!,1347926400,2,582,3.982905982905983
