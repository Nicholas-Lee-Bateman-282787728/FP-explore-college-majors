1200790,5,B00000F2YC,"I can't be anymore excited about the second and final season of MagSeven is coming out! It is such a thrill, and sad moment for all fans that this show was cut so soon. The show would have made millions!

I hope more and more people will want to find this dvd set and buy the first and be as excited as the fans of the show are and have been!

So glad it is coming out! Can't wait!!",1172620800,11,382,3.8227848101265822
1200791,5,B00000F2YC,"It is about time the second season came out!  It was an excellent show when it first aired, and it wears it's additional years very well.  It's a perfect blend of drama and comedy, with the spice of the old west - there's simply nothing like it on TV today!",1172448000,13,257,4.12
1200792,5,B00000F2YC,"My collection is now complete! This show was cancelled all too soon. But I guess as Buck would say, ""If the big bosses at CBS were any blinder, they'd be flying in walls."" They didn't know a great show when they had it.

This show only improved with time and could have grown into something truly amazing if only given a chance by CBS.  Thankfully the show will live on on DVD and that's a good thing...my VHS tapes are beginning to wear out!

1200949,5,B00000F2YC,"Thanks to the fans of the show uniting under a common flag and signing a petition, we got a second season. I wish it had never gone off the air. The whole cast was wonderful and I couldn't wait until the next episode the following week (before DVRS were standard equipment, not that we had cable at the time. We were still using bunny ears, the antennae not the mammal) Now that I own a copy I can plug it in and have TV show marathons while I'm sewing or doing other things that tend to get monotonous after a while. I can listen to it while I sew and it makes the project seem to go faster. I've seen series so many times I can practically see it in my head as I'm listening to it. If only it could have been more of a chance, it could have had the same run as Stargate SG-1. If wishes were horses then fans would ride... or thereabouts. If you haven't seen it before, take a chance and if you have seen it before don't miss the chance to own a copy for yourself. Who knows when DVD's will go the way of VHS or laserdiscs. Anyone remember Beta disk?",1386374400,,1051,4.033492822966507

Ditto what all the other fans say about this TV series. It was criminal that CBS preempted the weekly episodes frequently, changed viewing day and time, they made it difficult to find. A large, devoted following persevered to find it. Shame on CBS for cancelling this excellent series much too soon.

Amazon needs to check their cast info. I have no idea who some of those actors are but they were not in this series. The outstanding cast included: Michael Biehn, Eric Close (Without a Trace, Taken), Ron Perlman, Dale Midkiff, Anthony Starke, Andrew Kavovit, and Rick Worthy.",1337299200,2,737,5.040983606557377
1200989,5,B00000F2YC,"It really is sad that this series only lasted two seasons.  The story around the characters was outstanding and the actors involved could not have been chosen any better.

1200990,5,B00000F2YC,"The Magnificent Seven was a good series when it was on TV and I was so happy to find it for sale on DVD. When you set down to watch on episode before you know it you are on the third. This was television that made you come back for more.

1200991,5,B00000F2YC,I had bought this at the same time I bought the first season of the series and everything was to my satisfaction. The seller even noticed a discrepancy between the description of the box set on the website and the real box set so they emailed me to correct this mistake and asked if I still wanted it. I was impressed by the candor of the seller and so give this high ratings.,1295308800,,376,4.164383561643835
1200992,5,B00000F2YC,"I've always been a long time fan of Alias Smith and Jones, but this one rates right up there with it and it's maybe even a teeny bit better. Season two is even better than season one. Perfectly cast and great story lines, too bad this show didn't last longer, it really wasn't given a fair chance.",1274400000,,297,4.228070175438597

1200997,4,B00000F2YC,i read some reviews before i  purchased this second series. i was most impressed with the first season which was the main reason for buying.the reviews said the the series was canned.i just couldn't see why. it was far far better than the deadwood series.some of the stories in this second  season were starting to get a bit away from thr main theme but still good value. they don't make them like the old days. this one came very close.  regards  ken,1241568000,,451,4.463414634146342

1201010,2,B00000F2YC,"After thoroughly enjoying the first season of ""The Magnificent Seven"", I eagerly proceeded to the second season. However, the second season is nowhere near as fun as the first. The first season episodes were made in the spirit of the good, old-fashioned western, with no deep issues to get in the way of the action. It was the sort of thing that the whole family could enjoy. Yet, for reasons that are entirely beyond me, in the second season, the writers decided to introduce a look of psychological issues: slavery, rape, infidelity, J.D.'s guilt after killing a man... Not to mention the fact that someone working on this series has a major axe to grind against Irish-Catholics. I am not surprised that the show was cancelled after this season. By the time I got to the end of it, I didn't want to watch any more either.

This boxed set contains the 13 episodes of season two, packaged in slim-line cases. There are no special features included on the DVDs.",1206144000,,960,4.647058823529412
1201011,5,B00000F2YC,I love Magnificent Seven. I wished the serise could have gone on and on. I was so excited to find the serise on here. It's in a place of honor on my shelf.,1204502400,,155,3.727272727272727
1201012,5,B00000F2YC,"Actually missed this when it was originally broadcast. Can't believe It took me until now to catch this fantastic series! Amazon put these on sale at a terrific price and after reading the reviews decided to take a chance. The acting is great, the location shots awesome and the stories engrossing! Why this show didn't get renewed for many, many years is beyond me! Season two is just as good if not better than season one! If you like westerns you can't go wrong with this series.",1204070400,,482,4.551724137931035
1201013,5,B00000F2YC,"Why oh why did they have to cancel this series?
Finally a fun (clean), exciting, superbly written, Western series with fantastic acting comes along and its cancelled after two seasons.
I don't care what excuses there was for it. Not many series (Western or otherwise) have impressed me like this one has.
Even some of my family who dislike Westerns loved the witty, action packed episodes.

This is not a series only for Western lovers.

If you enjoy great writing, acting, action and a dallop of 'thunderin good times', you might want to check out the Magnificent Seven.
I'm not sure I would say that watching season one (which in my opinion is even a bit better then the second) is a must to understand the second, but it sure helps! Enjoy.",1202860800,2,742,4.613636363636363

1201015,5,B00000F2YC,"The Magnificent Seven rides again in season two of the sadly short-lived series. Resurrected under the watchful eyes of protesting fans, The second season tied together many of the loose ends from season one and created stronger bonds for the boys as well as exploring their struggles past and present. A fantastically well-written and intelligent show.

A word - there are some problems with the dvds themselves. A few scenes show some graininess, and there occassionally appear to be some issues with color adjustment.",1201392000,,520,5.190476190476191
1201016,5,B00000F2YC,"My husband and I just finished watching the second season.  We cannot believe this series was cancelled after only two seasons.  I originally
bought this item because Ron Perlman is in it.  He, as usual, is wonderful but the whole cast just came together beautifully.  The setting was very real looking and the stories were captivating.  It's a shame there isn't anything this good on television any more.",1197417600,2,405,4.897058823529412
1201017,5,B00000F2YC,"A longtime fan of The Magnificent Seven - series, not the movies - if I were ever to see the episodes again, it had to be on VHS tape recorded when the episodes were being aired by Hallmark Channel. At that there were only about ten shows. My daughter found - on Amazon - the tape of the pilot that I had never seen, and bought it for me. After several years of this, the first season was on disk. I bought two - just in case something happened to one of them. I was pleasantly surprised to have one show I had not seen, and deleted scenes TV had not aired. After about six months, I began checking on Amazon every morning to see if season two were available. I almost gave up, and then one day it was there. Finally, it is wonderful to have a complete set. The only regret I have is there will be no more. And, yes, I bought two copies of season two! Thank you....",1195257600,4,865,4.034883720930233

1201040,5,B00000F2YC,"I had not seen any of these episodes prior to purchasing them from Amazon. Based on the cast-members whose work I was familiar with @ the time I was fairly certain I would enjoy these DVD's and I was right. Ron Perlman's name alone is enough to induce me to watch almost anything & he doesn't disappoint as the complex Josiah; Dale Midkiff is excellent as Buck--a different type of character than I'm used to seeing him play.  Eric Close & Michael Biehn are superb as well. The other 3 actors I had not seen before but they are also excellent. The episodes are well written, there is drama, adventure & humor in most of them. Penance is my favorite episode of all with Achilles a close second.",1189123200,3,693,4.4140625
1201041,5,B00000F2YC,I think this series was the best... I admire the actors and the stories behind it. I do recommend this series for all the cowboy lovers out there. Too bad they decided to end this series so soon.,1188864000,5,195,4.157894736842105
1201042,5,B00000F2YC,"I have just finsihed watching and saying good-bye to this series. I am ashmaed to say that I didn't watch it that much when it came out in 1998. That is why such a fine series died, it didn't find its audience.  The second season really drives home how well this series would have been if it had been allowed to go on.  The stories are better and the characters are given more to do and allow to develope as full people. In the second season each is given time in each story to build their character.  The last show on the disc where Chris finally finds his wife killer was one that you wouldn't expect to find in a tv western. It was showed the back groud of Chris.  Buck learned what true beauty was and Josiah explains golf so that all can understand it.  Yes it is a sad farewell, it is ashamed that tv can create something that is wonderfull, kill it off, and give us crap. However the real villian is all of us who didn't support this show and shows like it.",1188086400,20,964,4.133689839572193
1201043,5,B00000F2YC,"Put simply why did they stop this show just when it was beginning to fully release its magic?

great stuff all round, western classic to the genre & one of the best casts ever assembled ashame CBS dropped it & gave us the money spinning CSI instead for two seasons of this show which is perfection & outdoes CSI ten to one.

Also the second season brings far greater and emotional depths to all the characters & special note to Eric Close, Dale, Anthony Sharke & Andrew K. the latter two never getting the chance to shine since but boy were they good!

Worth every penny & ashame there was not more for this is a western & then some better than the films or any other western flicks rolled into one!  Plus all credit to Anthony, Dale & Andrew along with the rest of the seven actors worth their weight in gold!  Any chance of a reunion?

Ackilles, The New Law & Lady Killers among the highlights quality, good looking & magnificent don't do this show justice!  Thank you Michael Biehn & Co!",1188086400,7,990,4.3478260869565215
1201044,5,B00000F2YC,"I have both sets, season-1, and season 2&3, and without a doubt, both are action-packed, realistic, and blends the older style westerns with contemporary ideas.  Character casting was magnificent.  Story-lines are great.  The only downfall is that the show was cancelled.  It is the best western series since Gunsmoke.",1186444800,7,318,5.428571428571429
1201045,5,B00000F2YC,"Now I love a Great Western, and having watch this series it is definitely worth owning. It really is just a shame that it didn't go on for at least one more season there were still a lot of unanswered questions. One such question was what happens to all the Guys in the Gang? Vin never gets to prove his innocence for the murder he didn't commit. Overall a Great series it was just a crime that it couldn't go on a little while longer.",1186185600,5,435,4.129411764705883

1201047,5,B00000F2YC,"Not having seen this series in Australia before, I am surprised and very disappointed to learn that it lasted for only 2 seasons. It would rank very high in my collection of DVDs and is certainly the best of any western theme shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I am not sure what the rationale was for cacelling the series but I think it was an error of judgment but that's now history.. all the pity as I think it could have lasted as long as Walker Texas Ranger.",1185667200,4,477,4.195652173913044

1201070,5,B00000F2YC,"This show was great, and should have been given the chance to develop further  than it did. This is the last season before it was prematurely canceled by CBS.

The acting and story lines were great. If you like westerns than this is a great show to watch.",1184284800,4,255,4.291666666666667
1201071,4,B00000F2YC,"After literally wearing out 3 sets of VHS tapes I was able to get a set off Showtime Extreme (along with tags for other shows, etc.)  which was an acceptable way to watch ""the boys"".  However, I am SO EXCITED to have a ""forever"" copy (at least until I test the theory that you can't wear out a DVD) of Magnificent Seven!  I rated it a 4 only because I'd have loved to have some of the ""extra features"" that many sets have.  Otherwise, it's perfect!  If given a chance by the network, this series could have done for Weaterns what CSI seems to have done for police shows.  The cast is the perfect blend of characters and play off one another wonderfully.  I had never thought of Michael Biehn (the reason I first tuned in) as any of his other characters, but since this series, he'll forever be Chris Larabee to me! And, other than Vincent of Beauty and the Beast, I've never enjoyed watching Ron Perlman this much.  It was the first time I'd seen the others but I quickly became fans, and watch Without a Trace simply because Eric Close is in it!  Bottom line, if you like westerns, you'll love this series!",1183507200,4,1107,4.334951456310679
1201072,4,B00000F2YC,"While the lack of any extras is lamentable, it's unsurprising for the DVD's of such a short-lived series.  That said, this will certainly satisfy anyone who enjoyed watching the series on TV and wishes to view it again.  The packaging is pleasant to look at and each case has brief summaries of the episodes and the original air date.  The picture and sound quality of the recordings is excellent.

As for the series itself, The Magnificent Seven is just good plain fun, with a cast of experienced actors who play well together and scripts that sparkle with excitement, drama, and humor.",1182816000,4,587,4.782178217821782
1201073,5,B00000F2YC,"I received the second series last week and watched the episodes one after another.  Although it had been a few years since I had seen the show aired on tv it still is a great show and I enjoyed watching this again.

The actors are great especially my favorite Micheal Biehn I just love him he is soooooo sexy and only gets better with age.  The actor who played Ezra is good too I haven't seen him in anything else though.

I hope that they have another series up their sleeve for this show as it would be nice to see some new episodes released but I am not sure there are any.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes Micheal Biehn and anything to do with cowboy shows.",1182384000,3,673,4.1461538461538465

1201075,5,B00000F2YC,"Season two of this series is a good as season one but has the advantage that it takes links from season one and follows them through so we have Chris finally finding out who killed his family and Vin [...] the trail of the man who framed him for murder. Along with this we still get the interaction of the seven very different personalities and the situations they get into protecting the town.
A very entertaining series.",1181692800,5,422,4.4935064935064934
1201076,5,B00000F2YC,"Love this series, great characters, with wonderful actors. I think my favorite episode is Vendetta - the excellent writing and guest stars make it really great entertainment. I'm a huge fan of Michael Biehn, Dale Midkiff, and all the other great actors in this",1181606400,3,260,4.931818181818182
1201077,5,B00000F2YC,"The Magnificent Seven is the greatest television series ever, period.  It only lasted two seasons, but it could have gone ten if TV series were renewed on quality rather than ratings.

Start with seven men who seemed to be born to play these roles.  Whether they were a gunfighter, a bounty hunter, a gambler, a healer, a holy man, a womanizer, or a kid wanna-be, these guys were all perfectly cast.  Add in the striking blonde Laurie Holden as Mary Travis and Robert Vaughn as Judge Travis and the regular characters are top-notch and perfect.  The sexual tension between Chris Larabee (Michael Biehn) and Mary Travis added to the enjoyment of every episode.

I also have to throw in a kudo to one of my old acting coaches, Karen Hensel, who appears from time-to-time in this series as a storekeeper. The sets and costuming were always authentic.  The stories were consistent with what we want to believe about the old west.  Each episode of this series is a one-hour vacation into a time past, where we all want to go from time to time.

We have seen these men cast in subsequent roles - such as Eric Close (One of my favorite actors, who plays Vin Tanner in this series) as an FBI investigator in ""Without A Trace,"" - and although they are all great talents, they will never again be cast in roles that so perfectly fit them.

I was ecstatic when I was able to buy the first season on DVD, and now that I own both seasons, I never have to worry about ""not having anything to watch.""

I absolutely believe this is the greatest television series ever.  I would be hard pressed to imagine a series would come along and be more enjoyable.",1181433600,22,1637,4.474747474747475
