1324962,1,B00003CYFD,"Waking up in Reno Directed by Jordan Brady is billed as a ""feel good comedy"" on the dvd but its anything but its a somewhat average, trashy soap opera of mishaps featuring one dishonest character after another. This one while it gave me three or four laughs are the kinda laughs you get when you see some get a pie in the face, that its cheap humor with limited value.

A group of buddies on their way to Reno find out that one of their spouses has been cheating on one another, amist this dsyfuctions, accusations of infidelity are exposed and peoples

so called values are burned to the ground.

The one actor that sticks out here as a sore thumb has to be Charlize Theron, which can be basically characterized as the ""whore"" of the movie. She has sex with her hubby Roy Kirkendall (Patrick Swayze) both in and outdoors. Roy is as dumb as they come, honestly, he cant even see her own cheating habits on him with his best friend, Lonnie Earl (Billy Bob Thornton) when the truth comes out.

Billy Bob though gives the best acting here, playing a loney husband whose wife doesnt want to give him the love he so desires. The guy is an utter wreck trapped in a loveless marriage

explaning why he cheats with other women including prostitutes.  Natasha Richardson as Lonnie's wife, Darlene isn't much better than Candy (Theron). In fact she is more SHALLOW

than her often complaining that her husband isn't romantic enough yet accepging superficial gifts likea  diamond in exchance for love.

As you can see its anything but a feel good comedy, a couple of laughs are very few and between the ugly characters and predictable storyline so don't waste your time.",1106352000,,1659,4.577702702702703
1324963,4,B00003CYFD,"I'm a fan of both Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron, so I decided to rent the movie. It was surprisingly good and surprisingly hilarious!

Two couples from Alabama who are all very good friends decide to take a road trip together to Reno to see a monster truck jam. They all want to find happiness and this leads to some very funny predicaments. Each character is different and is well-played by the actor. A mixture between white trash and redneck humour, you are sure to laugh and enjoy the movie - just as long as you don't expect a movie that might be nominated for an academy award.

It's not deep or artsy. It's just good, plain, raunchy fun!",1101945600,,653,4.433333333333334
1324964,3,B00003CYFD,"It is not hard to imagine why it took so long for this movie to be released. It's not very good and the story has nothing new or worthwile about it. There must have been more stories about couples sleeping with the other in the other couple. Billy Bob Thornton is worth seeing in this movie, playing a second-hand car dealer. Charlize Theron isn't bad as Patrick Swayze's wife. It is rather fun hearing Swayze talk with a southern accent. If you have too much money or a Billy-Bob obsession you can get it, but I would what until it's on television.",1086134400,4,549,4.392156862745098
1324965,3,B00003CYFD,"Best:
1) Much of the redneck dialogue was absolutely hilarious. Some scenes should give any viewer a belly laugh or two.
2) It was wacky and upbeat enough to hold your attention throughout.
3) There are a decent amount of special features including funny director/writer commentaries.
Worst:
1) The sexy scenes weren't all that racy. We get to see Charlize in her underwear and later splashing about in a swimming pool, but that's about it.
Recommendation:
If you like your laughs big, fat and dumb, then you'll probably like this one. There were a few good one-liners that gives this one rewatch value for some. The sex scenes, however, are nothing but tease and may leave you frustrated. Consider paying retail for this one ONLY if you're really into redneck humor and/or Billy Bob Thornton - otherwise get it used for half price or less.",1073260800,4,840,4.8
1324966,2,B00003CYFD,"After sitting on Miramax's shelf for two years, ""Waking Up In Reno"" had a cup of coffee in selected theaters before hitting the video stores, and it's not hard to see why: Despite its star power - Billy Bob Thornton, Charlize Theron and Patrick Swayze - the movie is a meandering flotilla of throwaway sitcom lines and faux Oprah lessons.
Thornton is Lonnie Earl, an Arkansas car dealer, full of shiftiness and charm, with a sweet, repressed wife Darlene (Natasha Richardson - yes, that one) Married couple Candy (Theron) and Roy (Swayze) are the best friends. Lonnie Earl's the kind of man who plans vacations to Reno in January for the rates and a monster truck rally - with a stop at a steak-eating competition along the way - while Darlene suffers as an art. Candy and Roy don't seem well matched, but they are trying to have a baby; the trip to Reno is, in fact, a working vacation.
""Reno"" makes no secret that Lonnie Earl and Candy sleep together - though their hearts aren't in it - and their infidelity figures heavily an hour into the movie, after the four have wandered all over the Southwest. Writers Brent Briscoe and Mark Fauser - Thornton buds - intend to poke fun at Southerners, but only Thornton, who's spent half his career on the bottom of double bills, squeezes out a half-dozen laughs - he's seen awful scripts before and he knows how to milk them. Candy is target for satire, but Theron, brimming with tears as usual, plays her dead straight. Richardson's performance is an absolute catastrophe and Swayze's just Swayze - staring blankly, stammering, flinching. I'd call it method if it hadn't become his performance of choice since ""City of Joy.""",1073174400,3,1669,4.699658703071672
1324967,5,B00003CYFD,"It was great to see Charlize Theron, Patrick Swayze, Natasha Richardson and Billy Bob Thornton team up for this film.  For some reason, magic maybe, their personal mannerisms make this fun flick feel like an honest-to-gosh Reality show.  You might call them hillbilly's, a small southern town where a man in a real man, a real man being demeaning toward his wife, their income dependent on a couple of small, mom-pop businesses and then there is the very close living between couples.
A little too close, as it turns out.

But that happens everywhere - didn't you know?  They do everything together, even though they can never agree on an objective amicably.  We see them as they start off on a vacation to Reno to attend a Monster Truck show. On the way they share a motel room to save money, share a bed to save money, gamble to earn money, predominantly ""guy"" stuff, you know?  And therein lies the payback for their chosen lifestyle.  I won't give the plot away, but it struck close chords with me and I'll bet I have a lot of company amongst those who have chosen to watch this film.",1071878400,,1088,4.520408163265306
1324968,5,B00003CYFD,"Waking Up In Reno is everything it's cracked up to be. Patrick Swayze takes on a role most of us have never seen him in - soft and somewhat dim-witted, gentle, and quite lovable. Charlize Theron plays the wife he is trying to impregnate. Billy Bob Thornton is a car salesman, and somewhat of a jerk in the film - but manages to remain oddly likable anyhow. Thornton's wife is portrayed by Natasha Richardson - a housewife with some issues of her own. These four quirky redneck friends decide to take a trip to Reno for a monster truck show and some much-needed vacation time. Along the way there are side-splitting laughs galore and a very dysfunctional good time. This is Jerry Springer meets Road Trip and the result is a ball of fun! You'll find yourself actually wanting to watch this one more than once - a strange sort of ""feel good"" movie - easily one of my favorites.",1063152000,5,875,4.475

The humor and emotion in this movie was intense to the point of uncontrollable laughter.  I was home alone when I watched it and surprised at how loud I was laughing.  The characters are well developed and portrayed by all four talented actors.  Although extremely humorous, this movie also had a serious side.  It tests the strength of true love and true friendship to the max.  This is a great movie that will leave you with a warm feeling inside.",1054944000,16,538,4.552083333333333

The always lovable Billy Bob Thornton and  Patrick Swayzee are perfect opposites, and Charlize Theron justs get sexier with each film she makes,  Natasha Richardson shines as the wallflower wife turned into a outgoing take charge woman when the trip to Reno comes unraveled in hilarious marital misadventure that forutunately ends in a typical hollywood all is well with the world ending.",1054339200,6,470,5.157894736842105

1325124,1,B00003CYFD,"I'm a lover of all things Swayze. In fact despite being a crew of fair normal people, me and several of my other hetero-life mates have a fascination and appreciation for Swayze that is borderline bizarre. With this bizarre-ness (sp) comes Swayze Night each week.  Yes Swayze Night. This has been going on for 5 months now. We usually watch all the greatest hits and find more obscure Swayze flicks to spice things up and get to now his whole film canon. Yes, his whole canon. Twas this that brought a small group of us (3 dudes and 2 girls so at least we're a mixed gender of weirdos) to WAKING UP IN RENO.

This will be the first film with Swayze in it that we don't watch again. It wasn't Swayze calling someone a homo that's trying to save his best friends life while he's choking, it wasn't his acting or Natasha, Billy-Bob, or Charlize's either, it was his character. Swayze portrayal of a sad pathetic one sided character was so well done, it was actually hard for us to watch. Like having a friend who was always a sign of strength that's been beaten down by life and has no backbone or spirit anymore. This is not the Swayze that does headstands in a post apocalyptic world while fighting sand bandits, this is not the Swayze that is down for The Rumble even while he's trying to keep Pony Boy out of trouble, it's not the Swayze who gives dance lessons to Baby on a log high enough above a creek that one fall would shatter a pelvis, and it's certainly not the Swayze who rides out to the 50 year storm to catch a wave in Bells Beach, Australia.

So I guess what I'm saying is. A real review of a movie covers plot, character motivation, story, how the director and cast convey emotion, etc. This review does not. I just feel like I was put in a corner and nobody came over to tell me or this movie that you can't do that.",1435276800,,1832,4.273775216138328

1325371,3,B00003CYFD,"Half the actors in this movie are very good,in fact they stole the movie, the other half very weak.

The Good:  Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron. They really seemed to jump feet first into their characters and breathe huge amounts of life and originality into them. Billy bob is a car dealership owner who cheats on his wife (surprise!) and Charlize basically plays the same rather white-trash character she was in ""Monster"" 'cept she din't git no Oscar for this one. The most priceless scene in the movie is when Charlize learns she's pregnant but her husband is sterile. The look she and Billy Bob exchange is worth sitting through the whole movie! There are some very good comedy lines in this movie, but parts where it really sags.

The Bad: Patrick Swayze and Nathasha Richardon. Swayze plays just too syrupy good, too much a complete doofus. Whenever he came onscreen, the momentum sort of died. Richardson, being British, handled the Texan drawwwwwwl just a little too strong to be believable. And her coldness towards her husband which made him cheat was also too weak to be believed.

1325376,4,B00003CYFD,"This review is dedicated to Natasha Richardson. (God Rest Her Soul)

This is an interesting movie in that it may APPEAR to be a simple low comedy. But, but, as we get to know these characters more, we see how deep and profound they really are. And there ARE a lot of moral lessons in this film.

The movie starts where we see that Charlize Theron (wife of Patrick Swayzee) and Billy Bob Thorton (husband of Natasha Richardson) have been having an affair with each other. But we also see that they regret their actions, and both want to save their marriage. The 2 married couples plan to go on a vacation to Reno. (As of yet, Natasha and Patrick do NOT know about the affair between Charlize and Billy.)

As they continue on their road trip to Reno, we are gradually introduced to the problems with the marriages (and of course what may have contributed to the Charlize/Billy affair.) Simply put, the passion between Natasha and Billy has disappeared in the daily struggles of their lives. Billy is trying to reawaken it, but he is burdened with a cold nature that naturally turns Natasha off. (If we wanted to defend Billy, we may say that perhaps, he doesn't know how he sounds.)

Another interesting angle is that Natasha and Patrick have an interesting similarity. They are both kind and compassionate, but they don't know how to assert themselves. This leads to them being hurt.

There are well placed moments of comic relief that release the tensions. But there is a 'predictable' but still abrupt moment of discovery which leads to a MAJOR explosion. But what is interesting is that we see Natasha and Patrick suddenly assert themselves.

Tony Orlando is good in his small role.

Overall, it's a great film that offers great comedy, but at the same time, it offers us true pictures of the human condition that can strike close to home.

1325380,2,B00003CYFD,"Labelled a `sleeper' and hidden gem, this is anything but - unless they were referring to a tendency to sleep through the movie..
A sizzling cast are completely squandered in one of those `what were they thinking of?' movies.
Patrick Swayze plays a dimwitted husband to Charlize Theron, and as the movie starts they are about to go on vacation to Reno with their best friends, used car salesman Billy Bob Thornton and his wife Natasha Richardson.  However, much supposed `hilarity' ensues as it all goes wrong, not least because Billy Bob has been sleeping with Theron - how hilarious!  Thornton plays a thoroughly unlikeable used car salesman so convincingly we just don't feel any of the sympathy we are supposed to feel for him at his wifes aloofness, Richardson makes the only discernible character arc as she loses the dungarees and frumpy look at the end to reveal the 'new her' (yawn), and Theron plays the confused sexpot figuring out if she did the right thing getting married to an idiot.  By the end you'll be convinced she didn't, but the movie would have you think otherwise.  There is not a sympathetic character among them except perhaps for Swayze's character, who could be sympathetic if he was not played so dumb that we just don't care any more by about half way through.  Perhaps there is some satire going on here, revealing this trashy side to the American dream.. but if that's what it is, the message is very confused.  It seems to be saying - ""Hey, has your husband gone and cheated on you?  Well throw a tantrum then make up because it was all your own fault for not giving him enough sex"" - very dubious.
Needless to say, they reach Reno, much shouting, revelations and would-be side-splitting antics follow as all is revealed and we wonder who will forgive who.
How such a cast ended up in this empty farce I can't imagine... Hey, if all you want to see is Theron in her undies - go right ahead, but don't go looking for depth or substance, or even a few guilty laughs... this turkey is devoid of all of those. (3/10)",1215216000,,2045,4.5710382513661205

1325438,4,B00003CYFD,"Believe it or not, my husband and I enjoyed this movie.  We thought Charlize Theron did a great job with what she had to work with, Billy Bob made us laugh.  It might be that part of the pleasure we got from the movie was remembering a trip we made out west.  We stopped at the place where Billy Bob ate the 72 pound steak, etc.  We're from PA and that trip showed us a world that we had never experienced before.  The bottom line is...the movie made us feel good (which is more than I can say for most movies).  Yes, it had its flaws but it was fun to watch.  That's good enough for me.",1138924800,,587,3.965811965811966
1325439,3,B00003CYFD,"Waking Up in Reno was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Patrick Swayze, Billy Bob Thornton, and Charlize Theron among others.

The movie sheds light on two couples from Arkansas who decide to take a road trip together to Reno, Nevada.  The ride is actually quite ""bumpy,"" with quite a few unexpected ""twists and turns...""

The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.

The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), while the humor and the plot are just about average.

On the positive side, the movie's southern flavor was quite enjoyable, though enough is enough when it comes to picking on them (the southerners).  It gets tiring after the first 20 or so movies!

As for Patrick Swayze's character being nave and slow, that was just sad/pitiful!

Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...

In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.

If a Billy Bob Thornton movie is what you're looking for, check out Monster's Ball.

If Patrick Swayze is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING series North and South, and the movies Next of Kin and Ghost.",1136678400,,1314,4.540425531914893
1325440,4,B00003CYFD,"Slowly working my way through every Billy Bob Thorton film, I came across this sleeper of a comedy.  For what it sets out to be, it succeeds wildly, and I recommend this to anyone who likes comedies with a slightly darker twist.  It's not earth-shattering, but the acting is terrific, and there are plenty of laughs.  Billy Bob Thornton stars as the lovably gruff, stick-his-foot-in-his-mouth sleazy car salesman Lonnie Earl Dodge.  He has some great lines at inappropriate times.  The other male lead is Patrick Swayze, playing the handsome but rather slow and doofy husband of Charlize Theron.  At the major climax of the action, when Billy Bob's and Charlize's philandering is revealed to their spouses, everyone in the room is fighting, but Swayze just ""doesn't get it"" and completely missed the secret which was revealed.  The ending of the movie is absolutely fantastic, and all the loose ends of this foursome's lives get tied up nicely.  Give this one a shot!",1134864000,,967,4.925925925925926
1325441,5,B00003CYFD,"I just happened to come across this on cable, and couldn't stop watching.  Waking up in Reno is in the gray area between drama and comedy, and succeeds at both.  The writing, acting, and cinematography are first rate, its heart is in the right place, and it makes one want to hit the road and see America.  It is one of those films that reawakens awe at the art of cinema, and makes one think and feel at the same time.  If, however, political correctness is high on your personal agenda, you might indeed feel guilty laughing, or feeling good, during this wonderful film.  As for me, I am ordering the DVD.",1134259200,,607,4.383928571428571

1325443,5,B00003CYFD,"If you are looking for easy, adult, laugh out loud entertainment, this is the movie.  It is a light hearted comedy and the story lines have been ""done to death"" but these 4 actors put a fresh spin on these otherwise ""trite"" characters.  Billy Bob Thornton is just brilliantly funny. You want to hate him but you can't.  To see Patrick Swayze playing what we think is a not too bright person was fabulous.  He did an outstanding job. I have never seen him in a roll like this.  Loved ""aphrodeliac"". (see the movie).  The person that amazed me the most was Charlize Theron.  She is not from this country and pulled off ""a southern girl with a some red neck in her"" beautifully.  Being from the south, I see those girls every day.  Natasha Richardson had the most sophisticated character of the group and played that very well against the other 3.  Watch this movie and take it for what it is.  This could be a cult film.  Some of the lines are not brilliant by any means;it is all in the delivery.  They are just plainly hilarious and my husband and I say them to each other.  I do like the title as they are literally and metaphorically waking up in Reno.",1125100800,3,1154,4.331775700934579
