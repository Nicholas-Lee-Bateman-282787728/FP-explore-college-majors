7990630,1,B00009ECCX,"I am going to visit the Galapagos Islands early next year and thought that this DVD would provide some useful information:NOT !

Quality is very bad, nothing to use on my upcoming visit.",1156550400,3,186,4.636363636363637
7990631,1,B00009ECCX,"I watched this with a friend whom I wanted to show the beauty of Ecuador. After the first 5 minutes of astonished silence, we laughed for the following 5 while watching the worst piece of travel documentary ever made. After ten agonizing minutes, embarassement settled in and we gave our TV a break and threw this piece of trash into the garbage. Give my six year old child a glass eye, a bottle of Pisco and an old super-8 camera and he is bound to do a better job than this utter rubbish!",1107388800,9,490,4.279569892473118
7990632,1,B00009ECCX,"by how amateur and poorly done this DVD was.  It comes in a plain white case, wtih what looks like a home printer label pasted on the outside, and on the disk itself.  The camera is virtually all hand held-think ""Blair Witch Project"" meets an island travelogue and you'll get a sense of this.  Right out of the player into the trash!  I loved the IMAX one-spend your money on that.",1079827200,20,381,4.323943661971831
