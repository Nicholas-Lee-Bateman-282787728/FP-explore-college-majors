8384510,2,B002ZARO6Q,This DVD was a disappointment. It seed that it was cut. The interview with the Brazilian reporter was cut and only shown toward the end as an news feature in the background. The songs were all the same and no new songs featured.  I love Freddie and Queen but save your money and skip this one. Other DVDs are superior. Try Queen on Fire at the Bowl which is superior.,1417737600,,367,4.242857142857143
