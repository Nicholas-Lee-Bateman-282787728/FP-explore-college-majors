2323979,4,B0009VBU3Q,"""The Rise and Fall of Rayful Edmond III"" starts in the only place it could. North East, DC around 1980. While Nancy Reagan cried ""Just Say No"" and mandatory minimum prison sentencing and conspiracy laws were lurking just around the corner, a young Rayful Edmond III started his path to become the most notorious and successful drug kingpin in the DC area.

The film profiles his life from a child selling drugs on street corners; rise to lavish fast-paced lifestyle enjoying the best money could buy; and fall - the infamous drug bust that took down Edmond and 30 family members friends and associates.  A bust made possible by an organization breach on the highest level - greed and disloyalty of both his childhood school mate and confidant, and a woman he trusted immeasurably.

But his reign was not over.

As did Avon from HBO's ""The Wire"", Edmond continued to run his empire from behind bars, using Columbia drug dealer contacts made while serving two life sentences, to expand his drug trafficking operation.  In turn he received additional 30 years to his sentence.

But still you have to ask if it's truly over.

If you are from the DC area and have heard buzz about Edmond; the film leaves rumors unaddressed, perhaps to protect the innocent and maybe the guilty as well.  Nonetheless, what is revealed what many are unaware of - his childhood, and family ties to crime dating back to the 1950's, painting a picture of one who never stood a chance to think of aiming to excel anywhere outside of the only world he knew.

No matter where you are from, if you like crime, social & cultural, or biographical documentaries, you will find this film an interesting, great start for new Director-producer Kirk Fraser.

Other than shameless plugs for a clothing line owned by the co-producer, the flow of the film was targeted - hitting the mark.

A definite must-watch intriguing story of wealth, self-indulgence, disloyalty, and tragedy - an overall great depiction of Edmond's life.",1124323200,4,1987,4.814705882352941
2323980,4,B0009VBU3Q,"I appreciated the depiction of this negative way of life in the inner city that appears to be so attractive to too many of our young people. Hopefully, this will deter some of them from adopting this destructive lifestyle. Kudos to the young men who decided to create this movie.",1124150400,2,279,4.6
2323981,4,B0009VBU3Q,"It was an ok documentary, however it did not dig deep enough into the details. There were still a LOT of unanswered questions, especially about his family's involvement, but I can understand why those issues as well as his sexuality did NOT come up.",1124064000,,249,4.681818181818182
2323982,2,B0009VBU3Q,"Rayful Edmond III probably is the most notorious drug dealer in Washington, D.C. history.  In the early 90's when he was arrested for running a criminal enterprise the trial riveted the area, or at least me.  From news accounts he started drug dealing at an early age - in fact his entire family has a history of organized criminal activity dating back to the fifties.  I read a newspaper account that claimed he was bagging cocaine for his father at the tender age of 3.

This docudrama uses news clips, interviews with Edmond associates and undercover cops, televised interviews with Edmund himself, and reenactments to tell Edmond's life story.  For the most part it is okay but the choice of music is sometimes questionable and the arrest scene staged for this film was a bit silly and overblown.

This docudrama appears to be told from the point of view of Rayful Edmond.  It tries to make Edmond out really not to be that bad of a guy.  His associates describe him as a peaceful, fun loving guy throwing money around to all his friends and neighbors.  For example, he settled a violent gang war because it was hurting both his business and the rival gang's.  And all those witnesses schedule to appear at this trial that got murdered?  That was somebody else not Edmond!  Give me a break!  This guy had connections to the Columbian drug lords and was crafty enough to broker drug deals from jail.  I find it incredulous to claim he didn't have anything to do with witnesses getting knocked off or that he wasn't part of all the violence that gripped DC because of drugs in the late `80s and early `90s (and still does today).

So I have to give this so called documentary a thumbs down.  It seems too slanted toward making the best case possible that Rayful Edmond was just a guy with a different line work.  If it had told this story and the other side of the story then I'd sing its praises, because who knows?  Maybe there is more to Edmond than news accounts make him out to be.  But this documentary certainly doesn't make a very convincing case for it.",1123545600,24,2064,4.514824797843666
2323983,1,B0009VBU3Q,"I watch alot of documentaries and this is by far the worst I have ever seen. I looked forward to watching it being somewhat familiar with Rayful's story but this dvd is just not made very well. This is an hour of reenactments. The story told in this dvd is so one sided. There is so much left I was left wondering why?

There is a quote at the end of the film that is almost comical basically saying the producers did not want to glorify drug dealing. If you do not want to glorify drug dealing try showing all the bad that came out of all the drugs in D.C. at the time.

I read that Kirk Fraser the maker of this film dropped out of film school at Howard University after watching this I think he should have stayed in school. This looks like it was made by a high school kid.",1161216000,3,777,4.038961038961039
2323984,5,B0009VBU3Q,"JUST SEEN THE FILM..AND WOW! I NEVER KNEW ABOUT THIS TILL MY NEIHBOR LET ME CHECK IT OUT. A MUST SEE! YOU WILL MAKE THIS A PART OF YOUR COLLECTION IF YOU ARE INTO FILMS LIKE GOTTI, BLOW, SCARFACE, ETC. I READ A REVIEW FROM SOMEONE FROM THE D.C. AREA THAT STATED THAT IT DIDNT GO THAT WAY AT ALL. OF COURSE IT DIDNT! THE FILM STATES IN THE BEGINNING THAT SOME PARTS WERE ""FAR-FETCHED"", THAT IS EXSPECTED IN FILM. YOU COULD NEVER CAPTURE TRUELY THE DEPTH OF WHAT HAPPENED. I LOVED THE FILM AND I WILL BE PURCHASING IT FOR MYSELF.",1156982400,,527,4.176470588235294
2323985,3,B0009VBU3Q,"Honestly, I believe this is one of the best documentaries that I have seen in a while. Living the middle class to upper middle class suburban life, it's always fascinating to see what's happening in other areas of the country, the dynamics behind what has and is happening and the truth behind such.

I first heard of Rayful when I was on a message board for my favorite television show, HBO'S original hit series, 'The Wire'. After reading a post, I decided that he'd be a decent topic for a paper that I was preparing for school. I did some research, however, I never pulled anything worth anything. He was a difficult man to unfold. I made numerous, yet failed attempts at contacting Rayful, for the purposes of an interview. However, he was nowhere to be found. In the system, or otherwise. Shortly thereafter, I heard about the film. The film provided myself with unparalled information. Things honestly, that made me, a 21 year old suburbanite, feel as if I lived in the 80's DC, where all of these occurances took place.

What's so unfortunate, is that men like Rayful were probably destined to be legitimate business men, charting courses for their little brothers to follow. It takes skill, knowledge, common sense as well as intrinsic business savy to perpetuate and prosper, even if for a short duration of time, in the line of business that yields all but two fates.

I was impressed at the directorial debut of Mr. Fraser. I felt that for such a notoriously untouchable and undocumented subject, he did a decent job with shedding light, from many facets on Rayful.

I was impressed with the overall content, as well as the validity and character.

I had some issues with the clothing, which in my humble opinion is not reminiscent of the 80's at all, and beyond that was just plain ugly. As much, I felt the individuals that played these people not only lacked the similarity in appearance, but lacked the overall essence of the the people. (Rayful, Royal etc.)

Overall, it was a good documentary. Some things I would have liked to see, that were absent. It would have made the documentary if he had shed light ont he rumors regarding Rayful's sexuality. (However, I suppose how much more light do you need. The man's letting other men braid his hair.) Still, it would have been nice. As well, as more light onto his familial structure.

I look forward to the second volume, presuming it will be better than the first.

Sorry for the long review.",1149033600,,2460,4.6782407407407405
2323986,1,B0009VBU3Q,"I'm from DC so I know how the story went. A lot of details were left out. A lot of things were highly exaggerated. None of the actors (especially the guy who played Rayful) looked like the people they were playing, his arrest did NOT go down like that, no one was wearing ALL-DAZ clothing BACK THEN and they never mentioned anything interesting about Rayful that people don't already know ...like his sexuality.

With a little more planning, better casting and creative advice from established Directors this documentary could have been a whole lot better.

Since this is Kirk's first documentary he'll get a pass.",1134950400,2,614,4.838095238095238
2323987,3,B0009VBU3Q,THIS DOCUMENTARY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER - BUT I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE DIRECTORS 1ST SO I WILL GIVE HIM BREAK.  THE STORY IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT IT AND HE IS A HOUSEHOLD NAME BUT I FINALLY GOT TO HEAR THE COMPLETE STORY.  THE STORY WAS INTERESTING AND SAD. YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT HE LIKED MEN.,1127433600,2,333,4.26984126984127
2323988,3,B0009VBU3Q,"As a little girl and DC native, I have always heard the stories of this Notorious Kingpin, but never the whole story. With this imformative docudrama you learn how he became the ""MAN"" to be around, and also how he failed off.

The information was great but it could have been a little better on the eyes. The movie could have been true to the time era,80's and 90's,and not mixed with the up to date fashion. All in all as a first time director I am looking forward to more of his work",1127347200,,485,4.159574468085107
2323989,4,B0009VBU3Q,"I originally planned on giving this documentary a 3.5 stars rating, but remembered that this docufilm is the up and coming Kirk Fraser's debut as a director. Coming from a director with limited resources and a limited budget, This film supersedes all expectations. So let's give this young man a break. Fraser really did his homework for this project and it shows.

Rayful Edmonds was not only the biggest dope dealer in the D.C. area, he was arguably within the top 10 list of this entire country's most notorious drug dealers. The killing sprees and increased murder rates of the mid-to late 80's to the early 90's in D.C. can be directly attributed to Rayful Edmonds and his hand in the colossal influx of cocaine and later crack. This DVD highlight's Edmonds' origins and keeps you glued to the tube for the Mach speeded rise to the top in the 80's. I liked the fact that this documentary provided so much credible info on those who surrounded Edmonds, who played a major part in his downfall later on. Fraser was able to provide the audience with some exclusive interviews with Rayful (previously recorded) as well as rare FBI wire tap audio bytes, which has his mother and other associates speaking in pig-Latin to confuse the Feds. The police and FBI agents who were assigned to infiltrate and bring down Rayful's operation are also interviewed. This DVD is very informative and I've heard so many urban legends behind this sad figure who destroyed so many lives in this country.

  I've seen other documentaries that highlighted Notorious criminals throughout my time, and I must say I was impressed with this one in particular...simply because it does not glorify Edmonds and the activity he was involved in. It's sad that so many of us glorify these individuals like Gods. Rayful Edmonds is responsible for more deaths than the average man can fathom.

  As for the negatives. I would have liked to have seen more information unfolded on Rayful's personal life. I've heard numerous stories about his ""questionable"" sexuality and behaviors, I would have liked to have seen that brought to the light. The actors providing the re-enactments looked nothing like the actual people who they were portraying in the film. Rayful was slim and fit, and the guy they selected to play Rayful looks like a low budget version of a cross between Ruben Studdard and Gerald Levert. In addition, Fraser could have done a much better job in making the clothing, fashions, music, etc...more complimentary to the era of the 1980's. Everyone in the film is dressed in 2005 fashion, so this throws the audience off quite a bit. Especially for those unfamiliar with this story. And since we're on the subject of fashion...the co-producer of this film, who actually used to run with Rayful, shamelessly plugs his hideous looking clothing line called All_Daz throughout the entire film. No one outside of the DC area is going to wear that junk, so why bother plugging it? That took major points away from this one really hitting a home run.

  I currently live in the DC area, and I was lucky to get my hands on this on its release date. This was sold out in every media outlet in the DC/Baltimore/Northern Virginia area for an entire month. Ultimately, I was impressed and I am looking forward to Fraser's upcoming documentary on the Len Bias story.",1125964800,8,3334,4.802792321116929

2323991,4,B0009VBU3Q,"It was sort of interesting, but it just left more questions than answers.  It's a movie that I had my teenager sit down and discuss with as we watched it and after.  I wanted him to see that lifestyle is short lived and he can have money from a good job providing he continue the way he's going and become that famous engineer.  Is there really going to be a volume 2?  I just hope that the younger generation don't try to imitate or glorify him.",1125360000,,446,4.151162790697675

It really speaks the truth about the lifestyle he lives. It also tells the story about how he was growing up to become the most infamous drug dealer in Washington D.C. This is worth seeing to me!

8067329,4,B0009VBU3Q,"A good documentary on celebrated Washington DC drug lord Rayful Edmond, who rose to prominence in the 1980s retailing crack cocaine in an open air drug market in our nation's capital.  Rayful quickly moved on to wholesaling kilos of cocaine when he secured a Colombian connection through the infamous Cali Cartel. His real claim to fame came when he got busted again after being sent to prison, dealing multiple kilogram shipments of coke, while in the feds at USP Lewisburg. This time through a Medellin Cartel hookup he developed while inside. The feds said Rayful was dealing more cocaine from inside then he ever did while he was on the streets. Rayful turned snitch though, tarnishing his legacy in the process. Still he is a certified street legend. His life and times are what rappers portray in their hip-hop gangsta fantasy videos. Rayful has remained a legend in DC and in the annals of gangster lore and is one of the most infamous characters from the crack era.

Check out the interview Rayful's enforcer Antonio Jones gave in the new F.E.D.S. magazine for more insight on this street icon whose name has been celebrated in the lyrical lore of hip-hop.",1335398400,,1164,4.815
8067330,2,B0009VBU3Q,"As a teenager growing up in the suburbs of MD back in the '80's you were used to hearing the name Rayful Edmond III. His name was synonomous with hustling and the drug trade in Washington, DC. I mean he was the Kingpin!!! When I finally got my hands on this DVD I was anxious to see it. Back then all I knew about Rayful were from the various rumors that existed about him...I wanted to know the truth.
All in all the documentary was good....wether I got the truth, I guess I'll never know. I give kudos to the director for using actual news footage from the various local and national media outlets and for interviewing officers and agents involved in the case.
I just wish the director would've put forth more effort in utilizing an actor who actually resembled Rayful and that the actors used in the documentary wore gear reminiscent to the late '80's (a track suit wouldn't have been too hard to find or Madness gear) instead of All_Daz gear (this clothing line wasn't established back then, but since the owner is the producer of the film, now I know why it was used - can you say self promotion).
Hopefully volume 2 will be better....",1182816000,,1140,4.433333333333334
8067331,4,B0009VBU3Q,"Very good documentary styled movie centered around a young man reared in the drug game. Dealing pot at 14, his parents guiding him, what else was there for him to do but grow up and become a bigger dealer than his folks were. His weakness was his trusting of too many around him and allowing them to get too close and therefore vulnerable to attack from the feds.  Not the best cinematography/sound or acting but the true story base was what made it worth watching and purchasing.",1173312000,2,480,4.517241379310345
