8226798,4,B000X3J4SS,"Less than two hours ago, I bought ""The Answer To Absolutely Everything"" DVD at a local thriftstore for 3 bucks. No visible scratches on the DVD so I thought it was worth buying. I'm planning to watch it tonite keeping an open mind since I have an interest for New Thought philosophy and  metaphysics.",1373500800,,300,4.555555555555555

Great well written book. Has the benefit of a writer who has been interviewed in the secret as a writer. The other plus is the workbook that lets you plan and identify what and how to get what you want, I like it!",1216598400,,504,7.5423728813559325
8226801,1,B000X3J4SS,"Attracted by the title, I thought it could be a could follow up to ""the secret"". As a matter of fact it's just a poor  and pale copy of it. It just seems the producers wanted to ""surf the wave"" ""the secret"" created. It's just a riddle on a pond. All the contributors are from the same walk of life, all are consultants or coaches, no new idea, the illustration stories don't match with the subject and seem to come out of the blue. It's all the same old things that our teachers have been taught : work hard, very hard and believe in it. No hard work, no pain, no gain. That's it. A very christian thing ! If you liked ""the secret"" don't waste your time with ""the answer"" because it won't give you any ... answer !",1200614400,,714,4.1
8226802,5,B000X3J4SS,"I love how this film features the stories of every day people doing extraordinary things to transform the planet. Their sense of personal responsibility for their own lives and the world they live in is admirable, inspiring, but most of all, duplicable.

When I imagine a world where everyone lives from excellence, contribution, and full self-expression, I imagine being surrounded by people like the ones featured in this film.

The experts and coaches featured also make powerful, rigorous distinctions about what it means to live an abundant, fulfilling, joyful life. It may not be all sexy and fun, but it is ALL transformational, impactful and life altering.

This is my Christmas gift of choice to all my friends and family. Everyone is getting a copy!",1195776000,,759,5.056
8226803,5,B000X3J4SS,"Brilliant!!!!!

A one of a kind documentary.  Messages like The Secret, but way beyond and with lots of heart.  Touching and informative.  Serious and humorous mix but leaves you moved to act.  To share with family and friend. A KEEPER!",1195603200,3,236,4.8
