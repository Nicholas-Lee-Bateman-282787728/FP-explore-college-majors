8191884,5,B000PITGNO,"I don't disagree with Devin's points, the game clearly lacks the kind of production that we've come to expect.  One camera is used and it pans from one side of the court to the other.

However, in my opinion, the game is a classic because there is so little of this period of college basketball available.  It also shows that Lew Alcindor was a special basketball player who changed the course of the college game.

If you like college basketball, buy this game to encourage the NCAA to release more like it.  If you can live without the modern production touches, you'll see a great game of basketball.",1199750400,2,603,4.546296296296297
8191885,3,B000PITGNO,"As a UCLA fan, I've always wanted to see UCLA Basketball under John Wooden.  The 1969 Championship game features a dominating Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lewis Alcindor, leading the Bruins to victory.  You also get to watch other well known UCLA names as Shackleford, Vallely & Rowe.  The downside is the reproduction of the telecast does not have frequent scores shown (or any graphics) and they cut out the free throws.  Overall, a more complete glimpse into the glory years of UCLA hoops, but the production value of the original telecast pales in comparison to any event broadcasted in recent sports history.",1195603200,2,619,4.980582524271845
