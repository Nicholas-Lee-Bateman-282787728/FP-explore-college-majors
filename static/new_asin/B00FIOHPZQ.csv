8615960,1,B00FIOHPZQ,Chaotic low-budget production.  Probably aimed at high-school age viewers.,1461024000,,74,7.222222222222222
8615961,1,B00FIOHPZQ,terrible movie,1423958400,,14,6.5
8615962,2,B00FIOHPZQ,I really wanted to like to like it. Terrible acting and ever worse story line. Don't waste your time. It is like a bunch of film school drop-outs decided to make a movie and this is the unfortunate results.,1421712000,,206,4.3076923076923075

See, there are five star ratings and there are five star ratings.
There are five star ratings where the stars are brass and there are five star ratings where the star is gold.
This one the freaking stars are unobtanium, if you catch they reference. They stars are crawling with midi-chloreans. These are they BEST STARS BINKY CHOTTORRHHIA GIVES!

We are talking like, off the top of our heads, ten films to compare it to:
1) Inland Empire
2) Torture Chamber
3) August Underground
4) The Forbidden Girl
5) Misa: The Dark Angel
6) Spirited Away
7) Gozu
8) Dead Ringers
9) Toolbox Murders starring Angela Bettis!
10) Drones starring Angela Bettiis!

Seriously, the Amazon reviews few that there were, told me to send this one on a long walk off a short pier! Boy were they wrong! You just have to expect something a little arty, not what you're used to as an American, you know. No offense. A Yank.

Gorehound Guidance Criteria:
Angela Bettis Equivalent: They dark-haired sultry one.
Malcolm McDowell Equivalent: They Orson Welles-ish producer type guy!

So here's my methodology:
1) I filmed myself two minutes as the movie started.
(I went slightly over they allotted two minutes, this and every single time!)
2) I set an alarm for twenty minutes, watched the movie until the alarm went off...
3) I recorded for another two minutes (I went slightly over they plotted two minutes, this and etc., etc., etc.
4) repeat 2-3 until thirteen (13) minutes before the end when I realize I'm a) in love with this film; and b) I have way less than 20 minutes left. So I set an alarm for five minutes.
5) Film myself one last time, just a couple of minutes before the credits, with SOUND OFF so NO SPOILERS except for David Lynch fanatics.
6. On final two minute record during the credits. As with most of the film clips here, I am assisted by action figures.",1419033600,,1930,4.5344827586206895
