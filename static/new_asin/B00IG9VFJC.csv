8641961,1,B00IG9VFJC,"I bought her dvd's based on such great reviews and was extremely disappointed. Not only were the workouts dull,there were no new excercises-many of them were the same ones I've seen in other Barre style workouts. I much prefer Piloxing or Tonique&Tracy Anderson. I honestly don't understand the great reviews on these Poise dvd's,unless the reviewers were paid or had never done another Barre style or Pilates DVD.I couldn't even sell this on EBay-I tried 3 times and wound up donating.",1428710400,,486,5.012345679012346
8641962,5,B00IG9VFJC,Dr. Teri Jory will get you fit & fierce.  If you can keep up with her you will be in the best shape possible.  Starting out the workout with 300 jumping jacks.  Doing 100 reps of most of the moves.  It's a challenge that is worth it.  These workouts are short but they work.  There are three workouts that are about 20 minutes each.  You will be sweating and out of breath.  I like her style and she motivates me to get into better shape!,1398384000,,438,4.070588235294117
