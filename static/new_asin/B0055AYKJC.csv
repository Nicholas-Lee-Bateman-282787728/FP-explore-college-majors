4572882,3,B0055AYKJC,"Read my whole comment to know what to expect...

Movie is in Japanese, but with ENGLISH subtitles...=D
Video quality from 1-10...I give it a 5-ish,...=P
It's almost to about 480p quality I  would say....=P
( could be better )
Subtitles are a little rough, meaning you might find yourself at times thinking what do they mean? What are they saying?

Anyway heres my review...

I was really hoping for better quality, but I wasn't impressed. I know it's a DVD and not Blue-ray, but it could have been better.
Also at one point in the movie my xbox read, *trying to read disc, or something like that. ( I was watching the movie on my Xbox 360 ).
Anyway, it only lasted about 12-15 seconds, & it started playing the movie again...the disc looked perfectly fine, so file on disc maybe wasn't burned on disc right?
But overall my 3 stars is meant as a positive review.
Just a heads up for anyone else that buys Naruto movies, you pay for what you get,  DVD quality, & subs.
So that being said don't expect beautiful quality & proper subs added.
Because during the movie there were some parts that weren't subbed, where a character would say something & subtitles wouldn't
Show up below them, so you were puzzled to what they were saying.
Also there were parts where subs were translated correctly & worded word for word from Japanese to English,  but needed to be edited so that sentences would make sense to the
Viewer.
Ifound myself a lot, trying to figure out what a character meant in a sentence when wording wasn't changed to fit American/ English style sentences.
But again I can't stress enough, this is meant as a positive review. Why you might ask even when you pointed out many flaws?!
Well because all I wanted was to watch naruto shippuden movies early, ( now!! ) because I hate waiting for Viz Media to release naruto movies in blue-ray / or DVD.
So in all, if your really picky on video quality ( like me! ), maybe you should just wait for it to be released on blue-ray in U.S,
Which will take foreverrrrrrrr!!!....-___-
& if you're also picky on subtitles to be accurately subbed, & eddited for viewers enjoyment, maybe you should just wait for Viz Media to release their version.
Now if your also like me & hate waiting for releases in the U.S, then you should get it. F*** it ! Just get it.
Better watching it now then killing yourself with anticipation from the release of the U.S ( Viz Media version )",1325289600,4,2413,4.472727272727273

4572895,5,B0055AYKJC,"i am a forever naruto fan, this show holds such lovely memories for me, i was a loner without any friends for the longest time, and in my youth i saw the series on tv for the first time and i could not keep my eyes off of it, but eventually the broadcasting of the show was canceled on the air, and i hadn't even learned the name of the show. I had never seen it again for 4 years, when i told a person about it, trying to find out what the name was. That person not only opened my case, but she also opened my eyes to a whole other universe of anime. She became my first true friend and through her i met other people like me. the deeper i got into the anime universe the more friends i made, and i was finally happy for the first time in my life. Due to my other issues in life i was able to relate to naruto in several ways, i was put into foster care for most of my life, so i knew what it felt like to not be wanted, or need or loved, and it wasn't until one person who cared enough about me to take me into her family that i was able to see a little light. Also i was born with a physical abnormality, a cleft palate and because of it i was shunned by my school mates and i was all alone for quite some time and that didn't make my life any better, until that one person who became my first friend out of our similar favoritism of this show. I love Naruto and i will never forget just how much it has changed my life for the better.

4572922,5,B0055AYKJC,"Just finished watching ""Naruto - The Movie - Shippuden - The Lost Tower"" released by VIZ Media.
""The Lost Tower"" is a combination time-travel/clockwork adventure where Naruto and his team are sent to caputre Mukade - a rouge ninja who is about to call forth the power of the Ley Line in an ancient underground channel of chakra energy.  As a result, Naruto gets thrown a thousand years into the past where he encounters Ninato Namikaze, the future fourth Hokage, and the Queen of Loran, who unbeknownst to her, is ruling a city of puppets while her people are being enslaved by one of her advisers - who is Mukade in disguise.
Another gripping and intriguing Naruto adventure.
This DVD also contains a Naruto short where he stumbles upon a magic lamp and release a genie.
Highly Recommended!

You get to see a bit of the fourth Hokage in action, which is cool. The story itself is ""very Naruto"". The ending credits are stills that continue the story so don't stop at the end. It can be a little confusing until you think it out. (Or mayby I'm just slow!). I only gave it 4 stars because it does get a little hard to follow and Viz's tendency not to give translations of Kanji on the screen.

I was excited for this movie when I heard that Naruto goes back in time and meets his dad and I thought that he gets to interact with him, and gets to fight alongside him in a huge kick-ass battle. ...Nope. Throw that all away. Naruto is the ONLY one who does anything in this goddamn movie! And another thing, Yamato was pulled on with him when he goes back in time, but does he help him? Sure...AT THE CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE. So yeah, the kid is left alone, with an angsty princess and Minato and some of the ninja with him only have a few scenes and this all takes place before the battle with Pain.

I know this seems like nerd raging but I just calling it for what it is. Please do yourself a favor and save your money. This year we have better anime films. One Piece: Strong World and Wolf Children are on the way next month and a Fairy Tail Movie in December. And if you still want a Naruto movie, Blood Prison is coming next year and after that Road to Ninja which actually has the Naruto/Minato father/son moments you wanted, just skip Lost Tower.",1381536000,,1138,4.168181818181818

 Synopsis: Naruto, Sakura, Yamato and Sai are assigned by Tsunade to go capture a rogue ninja named Mukade in the city of Loran. During the fight Mukade summons forth the power of the ""Ley line"" an ancient underground channel chakra. Naruto gets caught up in the chakra and is sent back in time in the city of Loran. There he encounters the Queen of Loran, Sara, whose rule is threatened. Naruto must help the girl regain her right to her people as well to find a meaning to what has happened to the city. Along the way he will encounter some unexpected characters and will give a true meaning in the words ""Never Give Up!"".

4572954,3,B0055AYKJC,"First of all, let me start by saying that I like the Naruto series a lot and for a couple of (personal) reasons I'll still be buying this movie once it's on sale in NA, but from this point on consider yourself warned: This is not the best Naruto movie. At all.

As I recall, this was the one that did in the scriptwriter for the past few (all of them?) movies--he was let go because this movie was panned so hard in Japan. Weak plot and weaker character interaction added to the weakest battle sequences I've seen so far made this movie a trial to sit through even though it isn't even an hour and a half in length. Watch it just for the sake of watching it, to say you've seen it, and you might not notice the issues present. Watch it twice, though, with greater attention paid to the nuances, and the flaws really begin to glare at you. I could go into a massive list of what's wrong with it from start to finish, but I already did that on my blog; at a ten-point font size it took three and a half pages to complete, so I'll just stick to the immediate issues here.

Barring Inheritors of the Will of Fire, the plot of this movie is essentially what has been seen in various series filler arcs and since the very first movie, Clash in the Land of Snow: Spoiled/jaded woman/child selfishly rejects everyone/everything because of some great personal past agony, but Naruto's blunt honesty and overbearing optimism inspire his unwitting victim to step from a suffocating cocoon of nihilistic turmoil, find an inner strength once feared lost, and help him save the day from a figure in the victim's life who had previously been considered trustworthy. The main difference in The Lost Tower--and a big plus, in my opinion--is that the new, one-time Rasengan invented for this movie has nothing to do with the angsty princess and her special connection to what in movies past would have been the chosen Rasengan power-up. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the only good thing I can say about it.

Yeah, Minato is on the cover here, but don't expect to see much of him; he and his team periodically drift in and out of various scenes, offering virtually no information and precious little assistance in the overall scheme, so that Naruto is more or less doing ALL the investigating (such as it is), ALL the rescuing, and ALL the boss-battling. What makes this particularly bad is that when there ARE battles, they pretty much consist of Naruto using shadow clones and Rasengan. Really--that's all he ever uses. EVER. The other characters--by which I mean Minato and his team, as they're the only ninja you see for any length of time--have similarly lacking repertoires. Each has a maximum of two techniques he uses, but the difference is that it's slightly less noticeable with them because they simply aren't THERE for most of the movie (nope, no Hiraishin/Flying Thunder God here--sorry). They tend to show up and save Naruto from a situation he probably could have saved himself from, then vanish while he dives back into the fight ALONE. I don't normally concern myself with the fighting aspect of any show or movie because I consider the story and characters more important, but these sequences really were just plain BAD.

You might have been hoping to get some father/son interaction with this movie. You were? Ha ha--joke's on you. If it were possible I'd advise you to buy just the last fifteen minutes of the movie and forget the rest. This movie takes place after Jiraiya's death but before the Pain-arc reveal of Daddy! Yondy, though, so there is no overt discussion about the topic--it's hinted at, but not explored. That, at least, couldn't be helped. However, there is nevertheless a nice, somewhat emotional scene between Minato and Naruto at what is pretty much the very, VERY end of the movie, and it's worth seeing if you're a fan of either or both of these two. And no, Kushina is never even mentioned, let alone seen--hold your breath for that one and you'll definitely pass out.

I wish I could give this a higher rating, because I like Minato a lot and it was fun to see him in a movie before the big canonical revelations, but his presence was minimized so much--whether because so little had been officially shared at that time or simply because as the title character Naruto was considered the only one worthy of the limelight--that he just couldn't carry the whole movie. If you REALLY want to see Minato and Naruto interacting and don't have a lot of money to spend, save your cash for the sixth movie--Road to Ninja.",1371945600,15,4541,4.636024844720497
