1654779,3,B00005RDRQ,"As a specialist in documenting cinematic Hollywood's history, David Wolper produced this item within two years after the death of Marilyn Monroe, shot in black and white stock, shown on television but once and then shelved, with its principal value to cinemaphiles that factor of contemporaneity with the star, focussing largely upon her early years and, in the main, with respect to those elements that propelled her initial success.  Monroe, never much of an actress, was instead a totemic figure of her period, a Sex Symbol, and as Lee Strasberg of Actors Studio states during a substantive interview, Marilyn had always a desire to be ""an actress more that a star"", her intellectual deficiencies notwithstanding; however, her performances disclose that she had not advanced much in her planned direction by the time of her passing.  There is a good deal of footage of her earliest films that is cut out, in addition to details of her first marriage to Los Angeles policeman Jim Dougherty, but it is instructive to watch her cavort in SCUDDA HOO! SCUDDA HAY! and even more in LADIES OF THE CHORUS, whereas there is overmuch emphasis upon stills of her activities, with an outcome being less than satisfying.  John Huston, quite familiar with Monroe, narrates well, although many of his scripted lines seem unduly grandiloquent, with the film's most telling moments including his mention of third husband Arthur Miller's educating Marilyn in the meaning of ""big words""; an obvious dichotomy between her clear delight with entertaining troops in Korea and at the famous John Kennedy birthday party, when compared with her ""serious"" acting; and the work's highlight: the unintentionally hilarious scope of emotions she attempts to display while ""attorney to the stars"" Jerry Geisler serves as spokesman during a press conference announcing an estrangement from her second husband, Joe Dimaggio.",1105747200,,1894,5.223684210526316
1654780,5,B00005RDRQ,"""The Legend Of Marilyn Monroe"" (which debuted in 1964, just two years after Marilyn's death) is a first-rate documentary film from famed producer David L. Wolper.  Wonderfully narrated by John Huston, this black-and-white film traces the life and tragic early death of one of the most popular and talked-about movie icons of all-time: Norma Jean Baker (aka: Marilyn Monroe).

Born in June 1926, Marilyn's all-too-short 36-year life is detailed with style, grace, and tenderness in this film, which features a beautiful musical score by Arthur Morton.

Marilyn's perpetual loneliness and vulnerability come through, even via the short snippets of film we see here, painting the portrait of a sad and ultimately-doomed young lady.  Marilyn's three (failed) marriages are, of course, touched upon here (although not in a wealth of detail), including an interview (circa 1963 or early 1964) with her first husband, James Dougherty, whom Miss Monroe wed when she was a mere 16 years of age. Dougherty was 21 at the time.

Completely omitted from this documentary are the rumors of Marilyn's ""alleged"" affairs with President John F. Kennedy and the President's brother, Robert F. Kennedy. Also missing here is the scuttlebutt and gossip surrounding Marilyn's untimely death. Many people believe there was foul play involved in her demise, but there is nothing in this film about that subject.  Perhaps, though, these omissions are for the best. The purpose of this film, after all, was not to stir up scandal, but to delve into the ""life"" of Norma Jean/Marilyn.

Many rare film clips are presented here, giving the viewer an even deeper look into the world of this famous blonde bombshell, via many of the people who knew her best.  One of the greatest (and funniest) of all Marilyn movie clips is shown in this film -- her ""one-joke walk-on"" with Groucho Marx in ""Love Happy"" (made in 1950), which has the famous eyebrow-twitching comedian ogling Marilyn up one side and down the other. .... ""Some men are following me,"" says Marilyn during her brief appearance. As Groucho peruses Marilyn's obvious curves, Marx wryly replies: ""Really? I can't understand why.""  :)

Mr. Wolper's unique style shines through during this film, reminding me of another of his excellent 1964 efforts, ""Four Days In November"", another superlative documentary film, which concentrates (in almost minute-by-minute detail) on the events of November 1963, when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.

Marilyn Monroe died in early August 1962, and (like JFK) is forever frozen in our minds at a very young age. And, like President Kennedy, Marilyn's death at such an early time in her young life has created this ""mythical"" aura around the actress.

DVD Special Features include ""Memories Of Marilyn Monroe"", which is a 31-minute segment (presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo sound) featuring bonus interviews with David Wolper and Director Terry Sanders, providing additional insight into the making of this film and their personal thoughts on Marilyn. Some interesting tidbits about the film and Marilyn's life are revealed in this bonus interview section. Good stuff.

Additional portions of the interview segments with Wolper and Sanders are also included as ""book end"" pieces surrounding the actual 50-minute documentary film itself.

A Photo Gallery of Marilyn images is also included, plus some text-only screens, including a nice ""Biography"" section on ""MM"".

The story of Marilyn Monroe is a sad and bittersweet one from start to finish. And this film captures those emotions quite clearly, along with happier moments as well.  This DVD is a valuable resource for anyone interested in ""The Legend Of Marilyn Monroe"".",1094083200,34,3870,5.2180936995153475

7952118,5,B00005RDRQ,"""The Legend of Marilyn Monroe"" is a wonderful and warm documentary narrated by her
 director of the two pictures ""The Asphalt Jungle"" and ""The Misfits"".
 I recommend this documentary if you are new to Marilyn and her life on and off the
 screen. Others may find this documentary a repetion of earlier documentaries they
 have seen of Marilyn. The new here is that John Huston tells us about his personal
 experience with her.

7952120,4,B00005RDRQ,Enjoyed the movie. Good insight to Marilyn's life outside the movies. I'm a big Marilyn fan so I really enjoyed this movie. Ms. Williams did a great job playing the part,1356912000,,169,4.483870967741935
7952121,3,B00005RDRQ,"movie was interesting.  i wasn't really impressed with the actress michelle but i am not a huge marilyn fan, just wanted to see what all the talk was about.  very sad that she led such an emotionally tortured life",1344297600,,213,4.435897435897436
7952122,2,B00005RDRQ,"The documentary seemed to be well done, but the sound quality was so bad, it was hard to understand alot of what was being said. The images could have been alot sharper as well. I'm sure I would have enjoyed watching it, had it not been such a poor print.",1338854400,3,255,4.12
7952123,4,B00005RDRQ,I rented this documentary because I didn't live in the Marilyn Monroe era and therefore I had no knowledge of her story. This documentary really helped me understand her story more. I only wished the documentary was longer so it could have had more depth.,1338076800,,255,4.688888888888889
7952124,4,B00005RDRQ,"This documentary deserves five stars! However, I rented the digital video, and that did not include the additional footage that other reviewers, who purchased the DVD, had mentioned. So, the lack of a five star rating is attributable to the extra footage not being included. Additionally, the sound quality is poor. I'm not sure if that's because my ears have been spoiled with current sound technology or what, but some things were difficult to hear, if not inaudible, over heavy static. (I'm only 23, so don't blame age! lol)

The documentary itself included footage from her movies, interviews with friends, co-workers, photos, etc. Lots of ""behind the scenes"" type footage from her films and various other appearances. That the director of the documentary coincidentally directed for her first major movie and then, her last, the Misfits, lends a poignant and intimate tone to the film. This documentary also provides a unique perspective of early Los Angeles and the film industry. As a Los Angeles native, this footage is mesmerizing!

All things considered, this documentary was a little unnerving. Many have speculated as to the cause of death, whether she overdosed intentionally or accidentally, or as the movie puts it, ""she was a woman who lived life on the edge, but did she leap or did she jump?"" Either scenario is equally tragic, and the film documents the plausibility of each.

Whether she lept or fell to her fate will remain unknown, just as who the real woman behind ""Marilyn Monroe,"" will also, remain a mystery. The saddest part is that it seems the world didn't much care who she ""really"" was at all, and it seems apparent that she was more than aware of this unfortunate truth. :(",1337731200,2,1705,4.913194444444445
7952125,1,B00005RDRQ,"The GOODTIMES video pictured here of THE LEGEND OF MARILYN MONROE was also issued with a different cover: red background and Monroe in a gold lam gown cut to the navel.

Both tapes are recorded at LP speed, which slightly diminishes video quality. Both have linear audio tracks (not Hi-Fi), and this limits sound fidelity somewhat. The 16mm broadcast film they were dubbed from has no edit breaks, but it is well-used, with scratch lines and dirt apparent, also the image is overly dark in spots.

The biggest flaw, and the reason I've rated this product only one star, is the show is missing a full nineteen minutes. After title cards we are thrown into the story at the point where Norma Jean seeks work as a model. This is clearly NOT where the documentary begins. Just as abruptly some time later, narrator John Huston proclaims Monroe has died and the words THE END appear, edited in. Again, there had to have been more after that moment.

IMDb lists THE LEGEND OF MARILYN MONROE (TV-1966) as running 53 minutes, accurate for a 1960s television hour. And this tape does indeed clock in at only 34 minutes, as I was disappointed to discover when playing the one I purchased here.

Its too incomplete to be worth buying, in hindsight.",1313625600,2,1237,4.660550458715596
