5890551,5,B00E4V0FAG,We saw this production when it was touring and we were absolutely enchanted.  It was Crazy Beautiful!  I wanted to get another look at this production and the video does not dissapoint!,1385164800,,185,4.75
5890552,5,B00E4V0FAG,"Love the DVD, but there is nothing like seeing it onstage-it is absolutely awe-inspiring!  If you have the opportunity to see this, go, go, GO!",1385078400,,143,4.72
5890553,5,B00E4V0FAG,"I love Matthew Bourne's choreography and the creativity and insight that his productions bring to more contemporary stagings of the old classics.  If you like modern, interpretive and classical ballet and have never seen his videographed productions they are more than exciting and entertaining.  I loved the ""vampire lover"" concept in this production!",1384905600,,352,5.622641509433962
5890554,5,B00E4V0FAG,"I really liked the performance. The problem is, couldn't they please stop changing camera angle? It is so annoying. It must be much better that I can see the whole stage. They should fire the camera man.",1384905600,4,203,4.513513513513513
5890555,5,B00E4V0FAG,"I love everything Bourne does. His pieces are very attainable for people who would not normally engage in dance performances. His contemporary take on a very classic pieces is risky and different, yet still inventive and pure.
I enjoyed it and have watched it numerous times since its arrival.",1384300800,11,293,5.0
5890556,5,B00E4V0FAG,"With music by Tchaikovsky, choreography by Matthew Bourne, and British dancers, there is only one possible outcome - a work of pure genius!  This dance production is one  of the finest I have seen in my life.  (That is over 40 years of dance.)  Matthew Bourne interprets Sleeping Beauty with a modern outlook, but without resorting to silly nonsense or annoying situations.  His telling of the story through dance, theater, magic, music, acting, and a few tricks which I won't give away all add up to create a lavish spectacular dance event.  The dance is a unique mixture of ballet and modern dance.  We are not subject to those acrobatic feats that so many today think make good dancing.  They don't.  I can say this because my grandfather was an acrobat, and he never considered what he did to be dancing.  The greatest moment in all ballet is the ""Rose Adagio.""  It is always scary to see a different way of choreographing the pieces everybody knows and loves.  Bourne and his dancers do not disappoint us.  His adagio is youthful and vibrant, and fills Tchaikovsky's music with the exhilaration worthy of Paul Taylor.  I usually only pay attention to the ballerina in a ballet performance, but I had a different experience with this production.  I was fortunate to have seen it live at the City Center Theater in NYC a few days ago.  I had a front row seat, so I was able to appreciate every movement and facial expression.  Most of the dancers on the DVD are different than the ones I saw perform.  However, my favorite performer at the live performance was Christopher Marney, as Count Lilac.  He performs in the DVD production.  I was taken by him because he is technically perfect while still being expressive, dramatic, and romantic.  His leg and arm extensions go on forever, thereby giving his dancing a beautiful grace with a never ending line.  He has moved on to the next steps, and I can still see his long, gracious movements sweeping through the air.  The entire cast on this DVD is brilliant, as were the performers I saw.  If you are a balletomane, you must have this once in a lifetime experience.  Unfortunately. few people will be able to see this performance live because the arts in the USA have lost funding.  If you cannot see this show live, this DVD will be a treat.  The sound is clear, and the video is perfect.  It is very difficult to film dance well.  The technicians on this project did a great job.  We see the entire spectacle when we need to, and we see enough close-ups to appreciate the dancers as people.  I love this production.  You will too.  Without the slightest reservation or doubt, I tell you to treat yourself to this magnificent experience.  It is family friendly.  Enjoy it with those you love.",1383782400,31,2746,4.614906832298137
5890557,5,B00E4V0FAG,"This production is AMAZING.  Matthew Bourne has taken a timeless, yet somewhat routine ballet, and turned it on its ear by re-imagining the story and choreography. I have watched this so many times; I never tire of it. Of course, the music has never been ""routine."" It is Tchaikovsky at his glorious best. But the new story, plus the DANCING and the ACTING in this production have transformed this ballet into something transcendent and sublime.",1431993600,,445,4.933333333333334
5890558,5,B00E4V0FAG,"A refreshing new take on a classic.  The choreography is breathtaking and the sets are incredible!  If you have an open mind and enjoy great dancing, this is the ballet for you.  Beautiful.",1430611200,,189,4.666666666666667

5890561,5,B00E4V0FAG,"I'm not usually a fan of modern ""reimaginings"" of classic ballets or operas, but this one, which recasts SLeeping Beauty as a vampire tale, worked for me.

The quality of the dancing is amazing, and I'll leave it for others to compare it to other productions and companies (I don't know enough to say anything on that score).  But really  I'm reviewing what Matthew Bourne did with the story, including the costuming and sets.  And it's nothing short of brilliant, in my opinion.

If you're a fan of ballet generally, I highly recommend checking this out, and coming to it with an open mind as to the changes/liberties taken with the story.  I think you will not be disappointed if you do.",1422835200,,689,4.60655737704918
5890562,5,B00E4V0FAG,I had to biuy after seeing the live production. Again Matthew Bourne's creativity shines bright.,1420502400,,96,5.466666666666667
5890563,5,B00E4V0FAG,This is a fantastic ballet. The documentary that is on the bonus features is also well-worth the time to watch. Love it.,1420416000,,120,4.5

5890567,3,B00E4V0FAG,"Interesting modern dance version of sleeping beauty.  I admit I was already biased, as I'm not a huge fan of Bourne's. His versions of all ballets are too ""out there"" for me. Probably because I had watched the classics so many times. The sets/props were wonderful and the scene changes were seamless.  I felt like I was watching a long choreography of 'so you think you can dance'. Still, a good modern dance to watch. I just wish bourne would stay away from the classic ballets.",1407628800,,479,4.558139534883721
5890568,5,B00E4V0FAG,"I could watch this over and over.  Such a cool, creative twist on a classic.  I will buy more of Matthew Bourne ballets.",1406419200,,120,4.173913043478261
5890569,5,B00E4V0FAG,"As others have pointed out, the story and choreography are changed radically. The story is pretty well over by the end of act 2 in the traditional ballet--all that remains is the wedding celebration.  In this version, an already suspenseful story hits a high when Aurora is awakened, creating an urgency to get to the final act.  My wife doesn't like the traditional Sleeping Beauty because of all the divertissements that have nothing to do with the story.  She absolutely loves this production.

The 1080p widescreen video is stunning as is the DTS MA 5.1 audio track.  The judicious use of close-up and full stage views doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the ballet, as so often happens in DVDs & Blu-rays.",1403308800,2,712,4.80327868852459
5890570,4,B00E4V0FAG,"I saw this production on PBS & mostly enjoyed it.  Sometimes ""updating"" a classic to make it more relevant or just ""different"" doesn't work.  Matthew Bourne has an unusual way of viewing dance as a medium and he is mostly successful.  I thought the choreography was original, the dancers excellent (I really love Adam Maskell) and of course, the wonderful music.  If  the costumes were ""lighter"" and if the set(s) had been a little less murky I  would have given it 5 stars.  In spite of my nit-picking, highly recommended.",1402444800,5,523,4.7444444444444445
5890571,5,B00E4V0FAG,"I saw sleeping beauty on PBS and was so taken I immediately bought that all his others that I could find on Amazon. I do like classical ballet but Matthew Bourne goes way beyond anything I've ever seen. If Rudolph Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov brought greater prominence to the male ballet dancer what can we say about this man. In classical ballets I always notice how the male dancer stands around rather stupidly waiting to throw or catch or lift the ballerina. There is this sort of awkward pause. There is none of that in Bournes choreography. Everyone moves seamlessly. There are no awkward waiting poses. This smoothness makes the whole story more believable. It is a story not a showing off of skills. His dancers are marvelous actors as well as dancers. I was so taken by the uniqueness and smoothness and wonderful story telling abilities of Bourne that I readily forgave him for a bit of shocking ness. I love his work and am waiting not patiently, in fact rather frantically for more.",1401235200,5,998,4.708571428571428
5890572,5,B00E4V0FAG,"Saw the production in L.A. last year, and find that I like the video version much more.  There was so much going on and special lighting in the theatre that this video focuses and highlights some of the missed moments.  The idea of combining so many different cultural views of the story, including the vampiric touches only gives more credit to MB's ability to re-create from the masterpieces and put a new spin on the genre.  If only they'd release his CINDERELLA and PLAY WITHOUT WORDS and DORIAN GREY and EDWARD SCISSOR HANDS..  At least there are snippets on line and even in the mini doc on this disc.  Yes, we can and SHOULD enjoy and laugh at the classics if they deserve response to their humor.  And thank you, Matthew Bourne, for making ballet an almost interactive sport...after all, without your audience's responses, what would this all be about?",1400198400,,860,4.7
5890573,5,B00E4V0FAG,"It's amazing, hands down. The storytelling, the costumes, the set, the plot twist--All are Fantastic! It is a must see/have.",1398384000,,124,5.25
5890574,2,B00E4V0FAG,"This version of ""Sleeping Beauty"" bears little relation to the classic version, other than Tchaikovsky's music.  The Princess is deliberately portrayed as an adolescent klutz and the prince as a foolish adolescent tool of dark forces, personified by the Lilac ""Fairy"" danced by a male in pseudo-Gothic costume.  If you like bare male torsos (one of Matthew Bourne's specialties) and females who are choreographed to dance like men, this is the ballet for you.  Lovers of inventive, creative, graceful choroeography can skip this one as Mr. Bourne seems to have a very limited bag of tricks.",1398038400,4,590,5.125
5890575,5,B00E4V0FAG,A superb yet contemporary creation by a spell binding production. Enchanting on the eyes and superbly danced. The company is clearly magnificent with a time worn classic.,1396051200,,170,5.333333333333333
5890576,5,B00E4V0FAG,"This is a very different take on the Sleeping Beauty story that most of us are familiar with. It starts in 1890, Aurora is struck with the curse and put to sleep in 1911, then she is awoken in 2011 to finish the story. This take is full of dark fairies and vampires(!), but it all comes together pretty well and makes sense. The choreography is unusual and struck me as more athletic than classically balletic, but it suited the production well. The sets were all beautiful, they reminded me of the dense imagery that Tim Burton uses in his movies, and there were some pretty intense scenes with the vampires, especially the finale. I thought all the dancers were marvelous and the young woman who played Sleeping Beauty was indeed a beauty, and very charming. Like I said, this is a very different view of this fairy tale, and I loved it! Definitely glad to have it in my library.",1395100800,9,881,4.478260869565218

5890580,5,B00E4V0FAG,"Matthew Bourne has delivered again- An old familiar piece in wonderful new form.

The entire production is luscious.  The dancing is superb.  The music is beautiful, and matches the dancing very well.  The costumes are elaborate and heavy and decadent, not always allowing the dancers to show their art, but beautiful. The change in costumes and setting from 1891 to over a century later is very well done, even to the use of cellphones and their cameras.  The heavy costumes can be forgiven as the over all effect is one of beauty and grace.  The entire production is well thought out, well choreographed in a wonderful mixture of traditional ballet and modern dance.

The story is well told and comes through loud and clear, not always true in ballet.  There are many nuances of the story that are explicitly brought out.  e.g. Watch the uses of the bedroom window and its shutter.  The lovers (David North and Hannah Vassallo) are wonderful with each other.  Adam Maskell as  both Carabosse, the dark fairy and her son Caradoc is wonderfully evil in both roles, and the character dies a well deserved death.  The concept of the little doll for both the infant Aurora and in the surprise ending is marvelous.  Count Lilac (Christopher Marney) is well portrayed and danced in an unusual over the top, decadent fashion.

Beautiful.  A new setting of an old tale.  Bourne triumphs again.  The production is billed as a gothic romance, and such it is, with all the trappings.  Sit back and enjoy a wonderful performance.

The dvd was very good quality, with both picture and sound well reproduced.",1390694400,8,1595,4.794117647058823
5890581,5,B00E4V0FAG,"I love Matthew Bourne's choreography.  This was lush and lovely, and new take on a familiar ballet, with fresh and funny details, sharp dancing, appealing characters, and an endangered romance.  What's not to like?

This version of the Sleeping Beauty by Matthew Bourne is completely unlike any other. It certainly could not be described as traditional but neither could it be described as trivial. This is a serious attempt to deliver a vision that equates to the story as found using various sources and then to enable Tchaikovskys music to drive the narration onward.

The flavour of this concept can easily be deduced from the subtitle  A Gothic Romance. This well-known story, like so many traditional fairy and folk tales, has a darker side not hinted at in the traditional ballet version. One has only to consider the Grimms folk tales or Dvoraks settings of Slavonic tales to immediately see that a darker version such as this is completely valid.

The fairies in this case are a mixture of male and female and are uniformly attired and presented in ways that are not entirely gentle. Matthew Bourne crucially addresses the concept of True Loves kiss which awakens Aurora by introducing a mutual attraction between herself and the Royal gamekeeper prior to her sleep. This makes the idea of True Love far more acceptable than the instant attraction between herself and a random prince in the traditional version.

Another key idea is that Auroras parents were childless and that the baby was supplied by Carabosse. Her vindictive response to not being included in the celebrations of Auroras arrival is therefore dramatically more understandable. Another addition is the idea that Carabosse had a son, Caradoc, who was able to continue her revenge into the future. The way in which Caradoc manages to break the spell, not being True Love, adds to another twist which then leads the story on to its proper conclusion.

The baby Aurora is wonderfully presented by use of a life-sized puppet which has a major interacting role to play. The puppet is also the means by which the story is continued beyond Auroras eventual marriage.

These ideas, as well as others not mentioned above, are both imaginative and dramatically justifiable. Matthew Bourne successfully tightens the entire plot in this production, clearing away loose ends and creating a more dramatic work than the traditional productions. Those who feel that the traditional ballet slackens dramatically in the final act especially will find that this version sustains a dramatic narrative to the end. Those concerned about Auroras reawakening in 2011 may be relieved to know that Matthew Bourne has a convincing, and possibly amusing, conclusion that avoids any potential mismatch of life styles!

The music throughout is mostly that of the familiar traditional ballet and is all by Tchaikovsky with only slight deviations, all driven by the original story line. It is important to note that his is an abbreviated version of the ballet running for 30 minutes less than the Royal Ballet version for example. This is not a loss to this production which is dramatically tighter as a result and as intended. All the dancers perform as well as would be expected although the steps are inevitably not the same as in the traditional versions.

The recording of this Blu-ray is musically faithful to the orchestral sound and of good HD quality. The visuals are equally excellent. The disc includes a substantial 52 minute bonus describing the ideas behind this production which is well-worth investigating.

Without going into intricate detail this production can be summarised as fully justifying its considerable popular reception and positive critical reputation.",1485043200,,3539,5.107266435986159
