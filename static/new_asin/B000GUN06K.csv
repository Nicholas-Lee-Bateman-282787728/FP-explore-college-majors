8134754,3,B000GUN06K,"I have taken classes with Angela Farmer at past yoga conferences and really enjoyed how I felt afterwards. I wanted to capture that feeling and I was left feeling a little short and confused. Unfortunately the other user reviews were not helpful at all. The DVD is a taping of a class session and Angela uses visual imagery (for some this may be very confusing) (location is Greece I think)during this class.
The class starts out ok but then the cueing became quite confusing and I found myself having to strain my neck upwards to look at my tv to see what exactly was going on. It felt like poses on the second side was always shorter. The structure and flow of the class was was confusing. This feels like a ""Stretching class"" for the hips and pelvis. Other than that, my wrists were feeling sore after a while.
This dvd is not for beginners at all. The class being taped seemed to flow into the known positions and if you are trying to practice with the dvd it will feel confusing. There are paintings of Angela's partner Victor Kooten in between which you will miss since you are focused down on the mat. I wasn't ready for the head stand so quickly and I felt like I didn't really get warmed up very much. Overall I would recommend this as a relaxation dvd  and only if you have had classes with Angela in the recent past. The music of chords and strings can be a bit irritating. Angela's voice is calming and she urges you to unfold into your own possibilities. I am a bit disappointed at how expensive this dvd was for the one hour class offered. I wish I had more options to pursue and change up the practice daily. The second part of the DVD is a bit confusing as well as I am not sure if you are supposed to be doing the poses before moving into the sitting meditation. I love the strong feminine aspect of Angela that comes through in this dvd and her presence however I think the essence of her class is lost in this DVD presentation. I really wanted to rate this DVD higher but can't for potential buyers. If I could return this DVD I would and get my money back. I think Angela's students are the target audience for this dvd.

8134755,5,B000GUN06K,"I am a psychotherapist and much of my work centers around re-connecting with the body and the authentic Self in a healthy way.  Angela Farmer's style is so compassionate.  Her approach encourages me to deepen into the poses according to my own particular needs and inner wisdom.  There is no pushing here to reach perfection, just releasing, releasing and releasing again into the perfection that is already there.  I love the women in the class as well--various bodies and styles of movement.  I often recommend this DVD to clients, whether they are yoga beginners or experienced practitioners who are looking for a fresh approach to their practice.  Kimberly V.
