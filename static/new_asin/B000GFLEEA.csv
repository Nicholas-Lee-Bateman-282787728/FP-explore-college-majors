8131387,2,B000GFLEEA,"Don't expect belly laughs here. At most this gets an occasional smile. The premise is that a secular Jew and rather disreputable character (he seems to be the owner of a bankrupt brothel, though this isn't made very clear) has to pretend to be Orthodox and observant in order to get an inheritance. Lots of heart-warming scenes of family reconciliation. This was a big hit in Germany, probably for the obvious historical reasons, but it doesn't really resonate with an American audience, and the occasional homophobic humor strikes a sour note.",1492300800,,544,4.989010989010989

8131390,3,B000GFLEEA,"Not a bad film; has some real perspectives on life in general if you can stick with it.  My wife is into foreign films so I ordered it for her for her birthday at her request and then she made me watch it with her. To me it was ""mildly interesting"" but I'm sure my wife thought it was great.",1234656000,,291,3.85
8131391,4,B000GFLEEA,"It's a comedy, first of all. It's not trying to plow new ground. What it's doing is tell lots of little slapstick jokes around the themes of cross-cultural confusion and similar.

And it works. This is a genuinely fun movie. I recommend viewers click around on wikipedia beforehand, dusting off their knowledge of the GDR. This movie touches a lot on religion, but there's an element of ""Ostalgie"" -- nostalgia for East Germany -- involved here.",1215302400,6,445,4.855263157894737
8131392,2,B000GFLEEA,"The movie has a complicated plot, true, leading to some amusing moments.  But there are also disturbing, gratuitous plot elements.  First cousins discover that they know each other already - because they had had an affair years earlier.  Most people would be horrified to discover that they had had relations with their own cousin, but not here.  Other cousins - one a nymphomaniac, the other very repressed - predictably link up, even knowing that they are first cousins.  In any case, it is decidedly NOT for the whole family, as another reviewer suggested.
Its best moments come from the East German family's ""Kosher for Dummies""-level cramming to keep up Jewish appearances.  Because of this the movie has some minor significance in being the first postwar film in which the directors and the German audience were comfortable with Jewish humor.  But if the film were set in France or Chicago instead of Berlin, I doubt we'd be paying much attention to it.",1192665600,,959,4.919254658385094
8131393,5,B000GFLEEA,Funny and heart-warming story of 2 families in Berlin reunited after the collapse of the Berlin wall. Very well done. For the whole family.,1180310400,5,139,4.833333333333333
8131394,5,B000GFLEEA,"A fantastic comedy, people who loved Billy Wilder will certainly enjoy Go for Zucker. Finally a comedy for grown-ups who can appreciate a good script, something we miss in Hollywood movies. It needs some knowledge of Jewish tradition.",1168473600,8,234,5.184210526315789
8131395,3,B000GFLEEA,"I saw this movie in Germany and thought it was ok, though not very original except perhaps for the fact that its a German comedy based partially on jewish themes.  The German title is ""Alles auf Zucker"" which alludes to the betting nature of the protagonist, whose name is Zucker.  Basically, the story is about an older Berlin pool hustler, married with children, who happens to be jewish and who only has playing, betting and money on his mind.  If I recall, he owes a large gambling debt and hopes to win the money he needs in a pool championship.  As he's about to enter into a championship match he finds out that his orthodox jewish brother and family are coming to Berlin in order to settle their deceased mother's will.  Zucker has not seen his brother for many years and lives very differently (hardly knows what kosher is, or any jewish religious beliefs).  Much of the comedy comes from the clash from Zucker's orthodox jewish family staying with him as Zucker's wife tries hard to keep up appearances and pretend they are orthodox as well, and also from Zucker trying at all costs to play in the championship match (including faking a heart attack) while family duties demand his attention.",1158883200,8,1202,4.672985781990521
