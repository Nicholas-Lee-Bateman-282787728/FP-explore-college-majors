7131161,4,B00WEAKYR8,I just love how all the reviews are about how the adults dislike the video. My son (2 1/2) loves the movie and he normally only likes super hero movies. Not my favorite but still cute and enjoyable.,1445299200,,198,4.2368421052631575

7131165,1,B00WEAKYR8,"I'll be honest. I typically am a fan of these lesser known animated films. I got this from Redbox for the night to see what it was like, being optimistic.
Don't even bother. There are probably a couple worse children's films out there, but this is definitely bottom of the barrel.

For starters, it made way too many references, including a painful one to ""Disney's Aladdin"" that didn't contribute to the story or humor.
Concerning characters, the villain lacked presence, the hero didn't do anything to help the story, the villain lacked presence even when he was the only thing on camera, and the king and his court made so many tasteless decisions I just wanted them to stay off screen.

The only decent part was the princess because she went through character development. In fact, this film probably would have been better if they had cut out Freddie's gang and the villain, leaving the strong princess character to compete in the games and get along with the other guys in a ""She's the Man"" sort of way, where she could prove her independence without being overly misandristic.

The cover may look promising, but watch ""Rango"", "" Ribbit"", or ""Mouse Tale"", all much better films and alternatives.",1440547200,2,1201,4.792270531400966
7131166,1,B00WEAKYR8,Worst show we have ever bought from Amazon ! Would not recommend to anyone!,1436745600,,75,4.428571428571429
7131167,1,B00WEAKYR8,"Positive:
Animation quality was good, but not great.
Negatives:
1. Most notably the actors chosen for English voice over were both mismatched to their characters and just plain robotic and boring.
2. Dialogue was just as bad; pointless without meaning or feeling and with no direction (conveying storyline/plot convincingly); didn't seem to have a targeted audience in mind either to young viewers or broadly intelligent enough for all ages; the worst was not being synced to the characters mouth movements which turned out to be an irritating distraction.
3. Animation quality as mentioned above was good but it also had the distracting quality of being too much (too misdirecting) in each scene making it difficult to focus on the central character's actions each moment.
4. Nothing creative in the storytelling: the usual princess doesn't want to be married, especially to the many unlikeable suitors; just wants to freely follow her own dreams but then, of course, one suitor is a little different from the rest which could affect her plans. The usual evil adversary to add an antagonist to the story which didn't turn out very believable.",1436486400,2,1143,5.117647058823529

8712952,5,B00WEAKYR8,"We really enjoyed this movie. .in our family,  kids of a range of ages, as well as older teens, all enjoyed the movie. It's a simple, cute, and funny movie. Rob Schneider is really funny in both parts he played, and the main roles played by Cameron Dallas and Bella Thorne were solid and told the story well. The music was enjoyable, and the animation quality was great. The olympic game scenes and a cpl action scenes went on a bit too long but the movie as a whole was well done and very cute. Would recommend",1450310400,2,511,4.268041237113402
