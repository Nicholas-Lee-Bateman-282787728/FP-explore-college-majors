4977752,5,B0068KTJ5S,Sheffey is one of the best Christian movies I have ever seen. The photography and acting is supurb. The scenery and action is so real.  Many of these characters have gone on to be with their Saviour in real life.  Its a wonderful movie that takes place in the 19th century about a circuit riding preacher and the amazing things he prayed for and what those real camp meeting days were like. Revival meetings were portrayed with realism.,1352678400,,436,4.576923076923077
4977753,5,B0068KTJ5S,"This movie is awesome.  We really enjoyed how Sheffey showed Christian love even when it cost him dearly.  We also really enjoyed how Sheffey showed forgiveness.  The Holy Spirit was strong in him.  Also notice how Sheffey's wife is so supportive of the Lord's work.  She sacrificed a whole lot as well as Sheffey did.  We need more movies like this that emphasise sacrificial love, forgiveness and lives devoted to living-out the priciples Jesus gave us.",1342656000,,455,4.921052631578948

Wow -- this is the most touching film I've seen in years -- I couldn't stop crying -- while watching it; this will tug at your heart like nothing else!

And the fact that it's not fiction but all true, will make this film a life-changer for you!

This is NOT ENTERTAINMENT, but rather, something much better. This story will answer so many questions you may have about your purpose here, and the importance of your life, to your Maker!

Purchase this film without delay. Tomorrow might be too late -- life is brief. Don't you want to know the answers to the riddle of life before you die?

This will answer all your questions, once and for all! It's worth any cost to get this story told to you, since it has to do with the value of YOUR SOUL!",1331683200,24,982,4.281081081081081
4977755,5,B0068KTJ5S,This is a timeless classic great movie. The Gospel is given countless times and has a powerful message. A much see for any!,1329696000,14,123,4.391304347826087
4977756,5,B0068KTJ5S,"This is my #1 favorite and most inspiring movie - and I don't mean to use ""inspiring"" lightly.

I have read two books on Robert Sheffey, including the one the movie is based upon, and greatly admire the life he lived for the Lord. The movie does a very good job at showing his life. I also love the fact that this isn't a fictional character.

The acting from the folk from Bob Jones' is decent, and it is mostly true to the book (though it moves some of the timeline around a little bit).

If you are looking for a movie that will be a great influence on your walk with God, to encourage you to serve better, and also for a movie that is good for any age, this will do the job.

My only negative comment would be that, since it has been ""digitally remastered"" the audio seems unbalanced at times - though this is only comparing it to the original VHS format.",1326153600,14,859,4.156626506024097

4977759,1,B0068KTJ5S,"If you're a protestant who lives by ""feelings"" instead of by the Word of God, then this fairy tail is for you. If you are a ""trail of blood"" baptist holding to the historic christian faith, then this scripturally unsound tale of a rouge, baby-baptising protestant and his magical sheepskin rug is not for you.",1478995200,,309,4.636363636363637
4977760,5,B0068KTJ5S,Great family movie and a faith builder. What Sheffey says near the end of his life is SO TRUE today. Recommended it to a friend; she bought it and has just about watched it every night for 4 months. She never gets tired of it and it still inspires her. I gave mine to our son to show his children and they all liked it too.,1478649600,,323,3.909090909090909
4977761,5,B0068KTJ5S,"Very inspiring account of the old tent meeting evangelists.

4977800,5,B0068KTJ5S,A great story about a circuit-riding preacher starting in the mid-1800s going to the wild areas in the Appalachians. Great example of Biblical Evangelism based on a life of prayer and total consecration to God. He impacted a wide area in a time when travel was often dangerous. He risked it all and surely has a tremendous reward in Heaven for it.,1456531200,,347,4.612903225806452

4977808,4,B0068KTJ5S,"Very well done, especially for a non-professional (university) production. Historically accurate for the period of his life covered. (Early ministry and personal life is excluded by time constraints.) Personality traits seem to be succinctly included. His lack of ecclesiastical connection is somewhat unsure after having done some personal research. Beautiful cinematography, good acting, make-up a bit heavy in aged scenes.

4977818,5,B0068KTJ5S,"This is not a story most will appreciate.  To often our views and biases keep up from taking a deeper look of the power of faith, perseverance and courage of conviction.  Also to understand the man's journey historical context requires looking at an event in the social milieu of the period.  Sheffey's life influenced people in a positive way.  Faith is the glue that holds community together. People had moral values which by contrast with today's standards hardly rise above personal interest and advantage.  If seen as an example of integrity and personal fortitude this story can enrich our lives. Christ continues to illumine the pure in heart and light is good from whatever lamp it shines. I recommend this video to anyone who seeks inspiration from the personal life of outstanding women and men.",1447891200,,805,4.933333333333334

Reality show lovers will complain that it lacked histrionics, lewd language, sex and violence. Those who love history, have family roots in Appalachia, genealogists and amateur family history buffs will most likely enjoy the movie. My 3rd great grandfather was an Appalachian circuit rider so I especially enjoyed this docu-drama.  It's not an HD wide-eyed experience.  It reminds me of an episode of the Waltons or Little House.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
This is an AMAZING movie. A little over 2 hours long and it seemed so short-due to the fact of how INTERESTING it was. Both my husband and I was glued to the tv. It showed perserverence in the face of many troubles. We both had a few laughs on how he got thru to a few of the people he went to preach to and a few tears during a couple of the emotional scenes.
**************************************************************************************************************************************************
This would be a GREAT movie for anyone who wants to take a glimpse into what people back then had to do to spread the Word of God. He was a true Man of God.
There was no cusing or sexual scenes. I truly belive that kids 10-12 would find this movie interesting-for the most part. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.
****************************************************************************************************************************************************
Favorite part was when another parishinor would not let Sheffey ""give up"" when he started preaching. We need more people like that now days -to stand in the gap for our young people when the road seems tough. AWESOME MOVIE.
I plan to keep this in our video libary-so that I can pass it around to family members. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY.",1386547200,,1636,5.965957446808511

4977978,4,B0068KTJ5S,"This movie tells the story of Robert Sheffey, an interesting and inspiring circuit-riding preacher in the 19th century. It is based upon true events, though some things surrounding Sheffey may be folklore. This movie is a very interesting portrayal of a man that seemed to just be passionate about Jesus and bringing people to Him. It is not really a documentary per se, but you will feel like you've gotten to know Sheffey after seeing the movie. Simple faith, love put in practice, concern for people and all of God's creation, the power of prayer, the importance of being born again, dangers of alcohol, importance of forgiveness, dead religion vs. genuine faith, the futility of living for this world as opposed to living for God, and much more are prevalent themes in this movie.

It was produced/filmed in the late 1970's by Bob Jones University. Now, my first thought when I found this out, even before watching the movie, was: ""How good can the quality of this film possibly be, given it was basically done by a Christian University in the late 70's?"" Well, the answer to that is: ""Better than you might think!"" Although you can definitely tell this was a non-Hollywood production from the late 70's, the quality level is actually reasonably good all things considered - especially since the film was remastered for DVD. The acting is a bit stilted and the dialog is definitely predictable in places, and I did think there were a few scenes that bordered on being ""cringe worthy"". But overall, this 2+ hour movie was reasonably done - it held my attention - and the acting, while not great, didn't really distract too much - it was alright all things considered.

Not everything in the film is necessarily 100% on the mark - and some of the ""Christianny scenes"" were VERY predictable. But I do believe this movie can be a real encouragement to Christians of the importance of really believing and living out our faith. As for kids watching this, I think this can definitely be a ""family night"" movie, but be aware that younger children might get bored with it.

4977979,5,B0068KTJ5S,"The movie ""Sheffey"" has a place in my favorite Christian movie list.  It was made by Liberty Bible College students as a project, but they have produced an excellent movie of a country evangelist in the 1800s.  Sheffey had an amazing encounter with the Lord and left behind a life that would guarantee education and success in business.  Instead he went to the mountain people with the message of the love of Jesus.  He not only preached it, but he lived it.  His experiences with the mountain people are certain to touch your heart.  There is a particular section where he gives away his beloved horse to a poor family along the road that is certain to bring tears to your eyes.  This is a movie that every Christian should have in their library.  Definitely five stars as a faith-building Christian drama.",1361836800,11,807,4.633802816901408

8494792,5,B0068KTJ5S,"As I watch Sheffey for the umpteenth time, I am excited to see how God has used this film to encourage and bring souls to Him for these past 40 years through it.  My son Jimmy Barge played Eddie as a young child -- my brother Paul Kilpatrick played Eddie as a grown man at Sheffey's gravesite -- and my Dad, Harold Kilpatrick played Sheffey, the grown and maturing man.  In his youth he wanted to be an actor and was signed up to play with the Barter Players in VA -- but the last year or so of college at Bob Jones, he felt God calling him to preach -- and he did so for 37+ years.  Bob Jones, Jr. asked him to play Sheffey -- he did -- and God gave him the desire of his young heart -- to be an actor late in life.  Two years later, the Lord took him home -- and he has preached all these 40 years through this film.  As I watch it today, I miss him -- I miss my brother Paul who is also there in heaven -- and I long for the day when we will all be reunited around the throne of Jesus Christ.  Amen!
