8390604,5,B0037HERKW,"My favourite actress Linda Blair is the subject of this hour-long documentary from the Biography channel. While it didn't tell me anything I didn't know, it is still enjoyable to watch. The DVD is fullscreen and with no extras, but worth it for fans. The main focus is on Linda's 70s movies, with 'The Exorcist' paramount of course, and her later Broadway performance and charity work. The 80s exploitation films are barely mentioned and skipped over. I know Linda is not fond of them, but I for one love Savage Streets, Chained Heat, Red Heat and Night Force.

Her 70s films besides The Exorcist are testament to what a terrific and underrated actress she is. Born Innocent, Sarah T, Wild Horse Hank and Sweet Hostage are all fantastic films with confronting messages and a social conscience.
I had the honour to meet Linda in person in Australia in 2013 and can testify that she is a generous, friendly and truly wonderful person. (And still beautiful!!).",1417219200,,957,4.8
