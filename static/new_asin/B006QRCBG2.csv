8503111,1,B006QRCBG2,"This is not the Blu-ray Complete edition, but the standard ""special"" edition which has the original animation.  It's just wrapped up to look special, and has some books included in it, but it's not the newer version of the series.

Avoid unless you just want the original series with some books.",1487548800,3,295,4.764705882352941
8503112,1,B006QRCBG2,"Is a great animation.
 But!
He should have told us is not in HD.
Every disc i bought even for a Starwars movie,  are remastered in HD. What I saw in Youtube also not indicated......
All wrong information",1445644800,8,203,4.315789473684211
8503113,5,B006QRCBG2,"When I started watching Macross again on Blu-Ray it was like watching a brand new anime.  It looks absolutely amazing.  I found this at a Book-Off in Japan for around $180 used and believe it is worth every penny.  The Blu-Ray special edition set comes with a bonus disc, books, and other collectibles.  There are no subtitles in English, so you need to know the story already.  I wasn't sure if it'd ever be released in the states, so I went ahead and bought it.  You should too.  Enjoy!",1378598400,11,488,4.415730337078652
