8224303,5,B000WMXUV2,"Love Debbie's workouts!!! I am 63 yrs old and have done most high impact workouts in my life so my knees can't take the hard workouts I used to give them. Debbie's workouts are great for me and something new and different from the BeachBody line. Also, these workouts do a lot more exercises geared for the waist and upper body than others that target the legs and backside. I love this series!!",1504310400,,395,4.424657534246576
8224304,5,B000WMXUV2,"I am such a fan of Debbie Siebers - her Slim in 6 program is the only thing that worked for me after I had my children and was carrying around all those extra pounds.  The combination of cardio and resistance training is fabulous, really works on the target areas.  These videos are perfect for when I only have 30 minutes (the regular series is 45 or so minutes long).  Even with the shorter time, I still work up a good sweat and feel my muscles working, and I've been able to maintain a healthy weight.  Highly recommended!",1263513600,10,526,4.336734693877551
8224305,4,B000WMXUV2,If you like Debbie Siebers you'll love these much shorter versions of her Slim n' 6 series workouts.  If you really get into the workout and get your heart rate up you'll sweat just as much in 30 minutes as you do in the longer versions of this series.  Well worth it if you are short on time and still want to get a good workout in!,1221091200,11,333,3.955223880597015
8224306,4,B000WMXUV2,"I bought these tapes along with slim in 6 and slim series. I really like the express because of the shorter time span. They're fast paced and effective. The cardio core really works your waistline and I work up a decent sweat. It came with a little calendar chart to show how to incorporate it with the slim in 6 tapes or the slim series program. I really like to intertwine these videos with the slim series tapes, especially on days when I'm short on time or just a bit too sore or tired to do a full length slim series workout. I would give this five stars except the music is a little too energetic for me and it doesn't have the option to turn it off like other slim tapes.",1197244800,22,678,4.143939393939394
