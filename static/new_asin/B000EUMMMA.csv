BUSHIDO VOL 3

After the disappointing UFC 98 event last night and by that I mean Matt Serra got screwed because he won that fight I needed an MMA fix real quick. So naturally I make my way of to Pride for the third installment of the Bushido series. Bushido means way of the warrior which is what pride was all about, so in goes the DVD. Also this Bushido is another Team Gracie vs Team Japan event, this time a best of three.

1. SHAMOJI FUJII VS KIM JINO-this fight only lasts one round but it is a good one for sure. Both come out hard in a slug fest to start things of, but once Fujii gets the take down it is over. He mounts him and pounds him into giving up his back, in goes a rear naked choke. 5.5

2. ALEKSANDER EMELIANENKO VS MATT FOKI-Fedor's brother came to win at this event and dominates the fight just over powering Foki. He takes him down and ground and pounds him until he gives his back. Much like the first fight this one ends with a rear naked choke. 4.5/5

3. KAZUO MISAKI VS JORGE PATINO-the first round is pretty exciting, there is a lot of feeling each other out but when they do exchange they do it hard. There is a lot of great action in the first round, exciting moments. The second round is another very exciting round with a lot of great action including a nice soccer kick, Misaki takes the win. 5/5

4. DAIJU TAKASE VS CARLOS NEWTON-the first round was good as there was some great action especially standing, but there is some great submission attempts. The second round is very close and most of the round is spent on the ground. Daiju takes a split decision victory, very close fight. 4/5

5. AKIRA SHOJI VS TSUYOSHI TAMAKAIRIKI-this is one of the quickest fights ever and pretty bloody for such a short time, 18 seconds. Shoji dominates with hard strikes and then destroys him with vicious soccer kicks. 5/5

6. KAZUHIRO NAKAMURA VS CHALID ARRAB-a great fight here as these two put on a classic as they trade blows and submissions. But at a little under 5 minutes Arrab gets placed in a nice arm bar after escaping one earlier. Great fight between these two that I fell is a classic. 5/5

7. MIRKO ""CRO COP"" FILIPOVIC VS HIROMITSU KANEHARA-Cro Cop was coming of his loss to Kevin Randleman in his first fight back and he wanted to prove he was back. Kanehara is a warrior for sure because he takes one of the worst beatings ever from Cro Cop. There are some deadly shots Cro Cop lands with punches, knees, and kicks, still Cro Cop can't finish him in the first round. The second round sees Cro Cop destroying him even more but he can't finish this tough opponent. Cro Cop gets the win. 5/5

8. RICARDO ALMEIDA VS RYO CHONAN-the first fight between Gracie/Japan is a good one with Renzo Gracie black belt Almeida representing the Gracie's. We got a good first round as they spend most of the round on the ground with Almeida controlling the round and almost finishing it. The second round looks like the first with some great ground action and Almeida gets the first win for Team Gracie. 4.5/5

9. TAKANORI GOMI VS RALPH GRACIE-this fight only lasts 6 seconds as Gracie shoots in and eats a devastating knee that stops the fight. That evens the score up quick and this one is over, Gomi wins. 5/5

10. RYAN GRACIE VS IKUHISA MINOWA-the final fight in the series that will determine the winner. The first round is controlled by Gracie as he gets his back a lot during the first round. The second round was controlled by Minowa as he did a lot of ground and pound and the round ends with them hating each other. It is real interesting to see them staring each other down before the split decision gives Ryan the win, Gracie's win again. 5/5

These fights were not shown on TV

11. BERTRANO AMOUSSOU VS RADU RADU-the first bout of the evening is this one here as not to much happens. They exchange a little but not to much, they were more active at the beginning of the round. The second round ends with Amoussou stopping him with a nice flurry but I think the ref steps in a little early. 3.5/5

12. MU BAE CHOI VS YOSHIHISA YAMAMOTO-the first round is full of action with a lot of strikes and take downs as well as some submission attempts. But there is some rope grabbing and some yellow card giving going on. No lie the second round looks exactly like the first so just reread my first two sentences, Mu Bae takes the decision. 4/5

This is a good event and worth the purchase, especially if you get the first three in the box set.",1243209600,,4476,4.337320574162679
8114701,4,B000EUMMMA,"In the earliest Pride contests I purchased, I really didn't give the Japanese fighters (especially the pro-wrestlers) any legitimacy.  They seemed overmatched no matter who they fought, and only when fighting each other was the contest close.  There were a few notable exceptions (Sakurabi)but that is my general observation.  This DVD demonstrates how bad these dudes have become.  Every bout is a knock-down, drag out brawl.  Most of the fights are entertaining, and only a few slow spots prevent me from assessing it as four stars.  I'm glad I added it to my collection, however.",1151107200,,582,5.073684210526316
8114702,5,B000EUMMMA,"All of the fights are interesting for Bushido matches (either 1 round or 2).  Gomi v Ralph Gracie is short (very) and sweet, while Minowa v Ryan Gracie was quite exciting and had a controversial ending (there needs to be a rematch under regular Pride rules).

This card also has Mirko's first fight after his KO by Randleman in the 2004 Heavyweight GP...three weeks after the match!

All-in-all, a very entertaining disk.",1149206400,4,421,4.819444444444445
