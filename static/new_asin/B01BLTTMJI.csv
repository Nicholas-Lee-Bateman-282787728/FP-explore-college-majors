Unique vibe - one part Alm&oacute;dovar mixed with juicy After School Special plot; no, make that more adult Soap Opera....the fab early 80s soundtrack threw me for a minute. There's a splash of Kundera,  a whiff of Mamet, and some colourful, fanciful, sexy as hell, allegorical dancing, and light is shed on Lationo/African American relations at the time, and gender issues are both gently and forcefully woven thru out.  Yet it still managed to be fun. Huh? How'd Kathy Collins manage to do all that, and so gracefully?",1504396800,2,673,4.834782608695652
8750537,5,B01BLTTMJI,"five stars for the blueray, really four for the movie. A piece of art to be sure. Glorious film to look at, with the low budget, how they got this to look so beautiful with its color is amazing. My only complaint might be that the film has an artificiality to it in its delivery, and dialogue, but still an interesting experience to watch. I was only 25 when this film was made, and one of the pluses I guess is that though I did not live in this area, I still felt that it brought a sense of nostalgia for me about those years, when I was a young man still in my 20's. Great commentary, interesting extra's really add to this Blueray, or DVD,. which ever you get. Also suggest that people who get this film, also get Ganja and Hess, because both of these films have Duane Jones and Bill Gunn, and though Gunn is only briefly in Ganja and Hess, he was the director of that film, made some 9 years earlier. Jones was also the major actor in Night Of the Living Dead. That both of these men were not involved in a lot more films, is a major sadness, and perhaps also is a condemnation of the film industry back then.",1496620800,5,1114,4.138248847926267
