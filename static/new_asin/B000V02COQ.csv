I purchased it again as it is a great workout that focuses on the lower body and is good for starting out a new workout routine or if you are already working out.  It's not super challenging, but it does the job.",1486252800,,290,3.9655172413793105
8215962,3,B000V02COQ,"You will feel the burn. I've only done this one a few times, because it's not easy on the knees. I like Jennifer Nicole Lee. I have a few of her dvds. This one is not my fave.",1382486400,2,175,3.6315789473684212
8215963,5,B000V02COQ,This workout is mostly lunges and squats. Very easy to do with great results! I lost 10 lbs using this video!,1369612800,2,109,4.238095238095238

8215965,5,B000V02COQ,"i highly recommend this dvd.  Ever since i gave birth to my son, two years ago, my hips and thighs feel so flabby.  This workout really targets those spots, and it's so easy to follow along.  I'm wondering if any one can recommend a dvd similar to this one, so i can alternate.",1263686400,,277,4.188679245283019
8215966,5,B000V02COQ,"This workout is the absolute best I have found to burn the lower body. The switch up of the moves makes this workout fun but also easy to follow along. I really do feel a change in my body when I do this workout. I love that this is not a long workout and is easy to fit into my busy schedule. She has an amazing body that inspires me to work harder at mine so I can look like her. I am always sweating big time when I do this workout and you really do feel a burn. So if you are looking to firm up those thighs and buns, this is definitely it. Look no further! I like this workout a little better than her total body workout (although that one is fun as well) this really works my butt off...literally. 4 times a week with this, and you will be in great shape. Hope this review helps.",1233360000,,785,3.9125
8215967,3,B000V02COQ,"I fell in love with Jennifer's Total Body Workout on cable, but the showing expired on 08.08.08 so I ordered this one for some variety.  This DVD does not compare to Total Body Workout.

Some information about the DVD:

I. Warmup - hamstring pulls, tapping toes, warriors, etc
II. First workout - some bend over leg stretches--various varieties without the weights
III. Second workout - some lunges with weights, zipper moves, plies and so forth (all with the weights in hand)
IV. Floor moves - varies leg raises and lifts without the weights or with ankle weights; the leg raises include the ones for the butts and outer thighs
V. Cool down - stretching on the floor

My opinion:
The DVD is boring.  The DVD is about 45 minutes and that is simply too long to hear Jennifer say: ""That was so good, you did awesome"" and so forth.  She sounds very fake in this DVD.  The moves are monotonous.  Doing this DVD alone will not burn anything on your lower body.

The DVD also seems more for leg toning.  Although she calls it lower body burn, she states repeatedly on the DVD that you will get ""awesome legs.""

The only good thing about this DVD is that Jennifer's body is OUTSTANDING.  She is the first person on an exercise DVD that had the body I wanted.  Mallet is too thin (probably genetics) and Jeanette and the lady from the Biggest Loser are too muscular.  Jennifer Nicole Lee is the perfect combination of thin and muscular.

Anyway, if you want to TONE the lower body, get this DVD.  If you want a workout, get the TOTAL WORKOUT DVD by Jennifer Nicole Lee.",1218585600,6,1561,4.4822695035460995
