Strawberry Shortcake is one of those characters you hope your children will emulate.mshe U.S. Kind and generous to everyone. She looks for adventure and always has a good time. In this episode we are introduced to custard her cat, and cupcake her dog. Custard always looks at everything with the glass half empty, while Strawberry looks at everything with the glass half full. Cupcake, the dog , frequently gets into trouble and makes messes.

Today Strawberry also introduce us to her sister, Apple Dumpling, she us one years old. Strawberry starts planning a party, and makes a list of things and ingredients she needs. Custard and cupcake help her and off they go on their adventures.

Strawberry Shortcake is a fun series,mthere us no violence, no bad words, just all fun and games. I found myself laughing along with my granddaughter at some of the funny events. Parents can feel self assured that their children are watching who,esoteric films with educational values. Strawberry Shortcake teaches positive values while having, fun. The videos are vibrant and colorful, the language is child approved. Your child will enjoy every episode.
