It's the first bad purchase I make on Amazon.
The two videos that the box brings have nothing of Neil Young's music, only interviews with supposed historians of Neil. Worse still does not have subtitles, neither in English nor in Spanish. Total disappointment",1518307200,,268,5.113636363636363

8520434,5,B007PK9NAG,"Other reviews here seem to focus either on a faulty copy someone received or a repeat of a previously released DVD. I presume beuing listed as a box set does infer a collection of perhaps titles available before and I agree this should be mentioned but the actual content here is very good. 2 DVDs first from 67 to 75 and second 76 -2010 telling the whole Neil Young story. Both discs contain a wealth of archive footage much of which I've not seen before
Well worth picking up in my view",1379116800,6,488,4.315217391304348
8520435,1,B007PK9NAG,"This is absolutely the worst video I have ever purchased. Here is why:
The majority, like 99%, of the video is complete nobodies....some obscure person who wrote an article, at best a biographer and a guy or engineered one song in '67. The other 1% of the video are clips...maybe 5 to 10 seconds at a time, of Neil performing commonly available (on you tube) footage. Who wants to see a 5 second clip and then listen to a complete nobody talk for 2 minutes about ""why this song is good?"" There are even more than occasion when these nobodies, in so many words, state that Neil can't sing very well."" Also, there were completely uncalled for and unprofessional statements made by these nobodies such as ""I hate Crosby, Stills and Nash...they are fat choir boys...""
Don't waste your money I repeat it states on the box:
""This set is not authorized by Neil Young, his management or record label.""",1343174400,82,893,4.5875
8520436,1,B007PK9NAG,.... unless you collect DVDs for the plastic ...  Just a couple of pseudo-experts rambling on as if they have insight into Young's career. Many books available that are far more superior and informative.,1342224000,42,203,4.970588235294118
8520437,1,B007PK9NAG,"So I got the DVD and popped it into my Macbook pro.

It doesn't play.

I popped the second DVD in.

It doesn't play.

Neil, how could you?",1341619200,8,138,3.8214285714285716
