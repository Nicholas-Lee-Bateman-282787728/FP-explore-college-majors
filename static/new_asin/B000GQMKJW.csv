""We Were There"" made me happy, sad, angry, laugh and at the end it made me feel...a little empty. I know it sounds bad but it actually isn't. Read on...

Summary:It's the beginning of her high school life. Nanami Takahashi, known as Nana to her friends, is new at her school. She meets Yano on her very first day and before the day is over she knows two things - he has the nicest smile and she wants to get to know him. Everything is not as it seems, because behind that smile is sadness and betrayal no one should ever feel...

Characters:The characters and their lives are so real, but their decisions leave something to be desired.
Nana just wants to make the boy she likes happy and make him look at her for who she is instead of always comparing or living in the past. She's proof that you can't control who you love. She is honest about her feeling from the start. I kept watching because it could have gone either. I won't say anything else about the characters because spoilers are easy with this one and it's definitely worth your time and money.

The video quality wasn't bad. And their voices (Japanese only) were genuine to their character and not annoying. The art is simple, and a little old fashioned but pleasant. It wasn't like regular bubbly anime that focuses on girls boobs or really huge eyes and I thought that was nice. Reminded me a little of ""Lovely Complex."" I noticed that the beginning had gray mist on the sides, some people didn't like it but i thought it added to the mood of the anime. I like the opening song and the lyrics match the story line. I love the lyrics to most anime.

There's drama in this one and it will leave you feeling overwhelmed. I still find it unbelievable that some anime could make you feel that way. The beginning it's better then the end, maybe better isn't the right word. It's sweet. You expect it to end differently. I wasn't happy when I finished it but now that it's had time to settle, it ended just as it should have. Bittersweet.

Now why did it left me feeling empty/a little depressed? Because they don't give themselves a break. Life isn't always princes and picket fences and this slice of life shows you that. They have the worst timing and even though they love each other it's just never ends happy. They expected for it to be 100% ok and life isn't 100% ok. You have to know some things are messed up and you have to move on.

But then again, when she has already said at the beginning of the show, ""..this is definitely going to be the worst mistake of my life..."", you can't really expect for it to be all picket fences and princesses, can you?",1295654400,,2660,4.383367139959432

I don't know Japanese but I was priviledged enough to watch a subtitled version of the first season and I'll recommend it to anyone who will listen. lol In fact, that's why I'm here. It was a storytelling experience that almost never happens for me. It's rare to find a story that speaks so honestly of true love, loss, heartache, healing...that speaks of life and the inner turmoil of human hearts. Of course it begins as a teenage love story and who hasn't experienced that? The feelings you walk away with after watching this story are overwhelming and palpable. I'm a lover of good, character driven stories. This is it, my friends. The characters are layered and charming. The story has all the emotional elements required to linger on well after it's over. It's sad, happy, funny, and inspirational.

What happens when inexperienced 15 year old Nanami Takahashi falls for the most popular boy in school, who's heart's been wounded by the death of his cheating first love? Motoharu Yano was not expecting to be able to let another person into his heart again, but when he does he has trouble being honest and facing his past mistakes...that is, until he realizes he could lose the one girl he's lived his life to meet. And what happens when your best friend is in love with the same girl? What happens when you have to choose between the right thing to do and the most important person in your heart? Can you find the love of your life in high school?

It's a story that leaves you crying at the end of the first season and begging to know what the future holds for Nanami and Yano.",1231804800,4,1662,4.555183946488294
