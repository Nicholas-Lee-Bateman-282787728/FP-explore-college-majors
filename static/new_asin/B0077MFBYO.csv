5060814,5,B0077MFBYO,this is a good movie. the only thing missing is that this movie is not in english. it only has english subtitle. but still recommend it to family & friends.,1357689600,,156,4.233333333333333
5060815,3,B0077MFBYO,"Special effects were superb - overall, this movies was not worth 9.95. Even with the broadest stretch of imagination, some scenes were just too far out there.",1357603200,,158,4.888888888888889
5060816,5,B0077MFBYO,Jet Li just keeps bringing some of the best martial art movies out. This one is a fantasy film that deals with these two snake women. One falls for a man and it is up to Jet to stop them.,1354924800,,187,3.7
5060817,5,B0077MFBYO,Excellent fight scene along with a pretty good story line to follow.  I am from that old school erra and this was right up my alley.,1352332800,,132,4.076923076923077
5060818,3,B0077MFBYO,Not as visually stunning as I'd hoped for and more of a romantic theme than expected; not one of Jet's best bust sufficient for a good Jet fix.,1351641600,,143,4.142857142857143
5060819,4,B0077MFBYO,"This movie is more geared towards children than the movie Green Snake, but never than less, the story is still delivered in a balanced matter but the overall deep impacting message takes a hit. The movie Green Snake is more sexual/romantic than this version. The movie Green Snake is on NetFlix, or you could see it on youtube. This movie is great for children, and Green Snake is fantastic for adults.",1344384000,,402,4.676056338028169
5060820,5,B0077MFBYO,Spectacular from the beginning to the end!  Jet Li took it to another level of cinematography.  A serious love story that trandscends realms and jaw dropping martial arts.,1335657600,,171,5.071428571428571
5060821,5,B0077MFBYO,"The Sorcerer and the White Snake has received some negative online reviews, most of them denouncing the CGI as cheap and crude.  I mostly agreed with this the first time I watched it.  However, giving the movie another chance with repeated viewings, I found that it improved as consistenly high-powered entertainment.  This is a high flying ultra-aerial action movie without authentic martial arts fighting, so kung fu purists should avoid seeing this.  What this movie does have is animated talking articulate animals to please children viewers, a tidal wave, two women with snake bodies and their live action human family mimicking animal behavior, an aging Jet Li at times fighting in often cartoonish CGI.  Amidst this wackiness, Jet Li manages to convey his real life devotion to Buddhism, communicating a composure as seen in so many of his past films.  With Detective Dee, Tsui Hark proved that Hong Kong directors (even when filming on the Chinese mainland) are still producing a unique form of kinetic cinema.  With The Sorcerer and the White Snake, Hong Kong action-director veteran Ching Siu-Tung does the same with this light classic of unhinged fantasy cinema...This DVD contains no special features.",1329696000,8,1213,5.18974358974359
5060822,4,B0077MFBYO,"This is another retelling of the Legend of the White Snake, an ancient tale from Chinese mythology. It's a fantasy, fairly heavy on the CGI, but nice to look at. The story revolves around a monk (Jet Li) and a snake spirit (Huang Shengyi). The snake spirit falls in love with a human man, and he with her. You'll never guess what happens next. Yep, it turns out that spirit-human lovin' is verboten. Our monk, endowed with supernatural monk-powers, is hell-bent on putting an end to the relationship. Tragedy ensues.

In the classic telling, the monk is clearly the villain - he is himself a former spirit and is driven by jealousy against the snake spirit. In this version, the monk gets a more sympathetic treatment. I think the movie suffers for it. I can't get behind what the monk ultimately seems to stand for - wrapping senseless social codes in faux spirituality and self-righteously imposing those superstitious traditions on others, despite the cost to them. IMO, if anything deserves getting kung-fu kicked into the eternal abyss, it's that.

I don't want to give too much away. Suffice it to say that, though the snake spirit probably goes too far in seeking payback, the movie would have felt more satisfying had it taken a stronger stance against the monk's provincialism, prejudice, and hypocrisy.

That said, as far as ancient Chinese mytho-tragedies go, this movie is worth watching. It's a nice love story. Huang Shengyi is enchanting, and her love interest is a sweet guy worth rooting for. We love her all the more for falling for a guy like him. In the purely-for-the-sake-of-eye-candy department, there's a forest battle with some sexy demon minions. But it's brief. Which I suppose is a good thing, since it's quite probably more cheesy than sexy.

There's also a cute side relationship between the snake spirit's mischievous and capricious ""little sister"" (Charlene Choi) and a hapless upstart monk (Wen Zhang). This is another familiar genre trope (e.g., Qe'er and Pang Lang in Painted Skin: The Resurrection). The relationship provides the film with an opportunity to take some humorous pot shots at the stuffy prudishness of monastic culture.

Sidenote - It seems some people get confused because the spirits are all described as ""demons"" in translation. Because of the Judeo-Christian tradition, Westerners tend to have a one-dimensional understanding of demons - pure evil. In Chinese mythology, it's not so cut-and-dried. Both demons and gods can be good or evil - most often, they're somewhere in between. (For example, in Snow Girl and the Dark Crystal, the female ""demon"" is the heroine while the main ""god"" in the story ends up being the bad guy.) To some extent, the ""gods"" represent sanctioned authority, while the ""demons"" represent the marginalized. In ancient China, camouflaging narratives this way enabled story-tellers to criticize the state with a slightly reduced risk of having their heads lopped off.",1484697600,5,2946,5.053497942386831
5060823,3,B0077MFBYO,Would've expected better graphics. Still a decent movie tho.,1484438400,,60,5.777777777777778
5060824,5,B0077MFBYO,Loved it! Both visually and the story line goes much deeper than the simple story portrayed.,1484006400,,92,4.8125
5060825,5,B0077MFBYO,"Enjoyed the movie a lot. The Chinese myths seem to have a lot of tragedy though.... It is not a happy ending kind of movie.  The effects were scifi channel at some spots, but better on most.  The scenery shots were awesome. Soundtrack was great. We watched in English.  It did not match too well, but it honestly was not bad.  I was happy with the movie.",1483920000,,354,4.2388059701492535
5060826,5,B0077MFBYO,"A well crafted movie with really excellent CGI and fascinating story line. The love story has a realism and poignancy (even if it is between a human and a demon). You can't always have what you want, and love doesn't always conquer all.",1475193600,,236,4.511627906976744
5060827,2,B0077MFBYO,"B-Movie fun.  Graphics are good, plot is a serious mash-up of several genres (martial arts, romance, good vs evil, etc.) for a mindlessly entertaining film.

5060830,2,B0077MFBYO,"I didn't realize the movie had English sub titles, which makes it a bit difficult to read what they are saying, and watch the action at the same time. Combine that with a sad story line, and the action of the movie can't make up for it.",1470009600,,236,4.042553191489362

5060835,4,B0077MFBYO,"Yes, it's over-the-top in dozens of ways. Yes, there's some pretty cartoon-level CGI. Yes, you will find yourself shouting WHAAAAT???? at the screen a handful of times throughout the ninety minutes or so the movie plays. But...who cares??? It was fun, amusing, endearing, sweet, silly, and full of enough wtf action and utter insanity that it's nearly impossible to resist.

Based on an old Chinese legend, as many of the fantasy movies out of China are these last years, the story centers around a forbidden love between a demon and a human. Jet Li is a monk trying to keep things straight in the midst of the chaos and there's plenty of Buddhist devotion. It's funny to imagine a similar movie made in the west with this much blatant religious reverence and how it would be received.

At any rate, The Sorcerer and The White Snake is a fast-paced movie that takes the laughable fx joy of Sharknado and adds in the trad eastern flavors of kung fu, monks, gushy romance, and popcorn good times. It isn't Zhang Yimou or even Stephen Chow, but it's a fun joyride on waves of ridiculousness.",1461110400,,1088,4.661458333333333
5060836,4,B0077MFBYO,"The Sorcerer and the Snake is a Chinese adventure movie  I hesitate to use the term action movie  starring Jet Li. The tale is in many respects a morality tale about the pitfalls of humans and demons intermingling and thus disturbing what is purported to be the natural order of things. Later in the film this is challenged. The film also looks at forms of friendship and love.

In essence the film is borne along very much by its special effects which are numerous and well done. Jet Li provides the presence of the stereotypical and annoyingly infallible (and unbeatable) monk. Hes not really required to do much apart from be Jet Li and regularly spout spiritual platitudes. The support cast is solid and there are some fun and tender acting moments.

Plot wise, basically a demon beguiles a human male and they are deliriously happy. But of course the films premise is that such mingling is not good and Jet Li and his trusty sidekick go about the joint defeating demons and trapping them. It is these scenes that provide so much of the special effects magic and lovers of this sort of thing will be in for a treat. The crispness of things fairly leaps off the screen. In any event, our erstwhile monks are soon embroiled in a fight not only with the demon who has taken up with a human but also her sister. Via various ways and means things escalate to the point where all hell breaks loose and the demons unleash some pretty fierce supernatural powers onto our hero who has lost the assistance of his, err assistant due to complications (sorry, won't elaborate and be guilty of a spoiler).

After all is said and done Jet Li of course emerges triumphant. Again. But not before the travails of his assistant lead him to question his previous black/white way of seeing demons. And not without some heart wrenching fates befall some of the other major characters. The ending does drag a little, presumably having assembled the budget and the tech boffins the films creators figured they might as well use them and the love affair between Chinese cinema and overwrought melodramatics threatens to collapse the film in a few places.

This is a fun film with the special effects effectively starring. There are some lighter moments and mostly the action sequences avoid being overlong expositions of gymnastic (wire assisted) skill. A few of the themes and scenes might trouble younger viewers who otherwise would probably enjoy much of the movie. All up this is an enjoyable enough film that just wallows a bit too much in the sentimental.",1459728000,,2540,4.70945945945946
5060837,1,B0077MFBYO,"Ugh...  I'm a fan of these types of cheesy Buddhist mythical tales combined with Kung-fu style action, but this movie was very poorly done. The story and action combination feels like it was either written by a ten-year old or they were making it up as they were going along. E.g., in one of the fight scenes, one of the demons just starts shooting swords out of thin air. And the CGI was horribly done. Overall, this movie had the look and feel of a poorly made cartoon--everything from the story to the acting to the CGI was so unbelievable, I just could not suspend my sense of reality enough to be drawn in even though I really wanted to like this movie. Save your money and your time. Don't waste either on this movie.",1459641600,,723,4.355555555555555

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because there was no nudity.

5060932,3,B0077MFBYO,"A good rainy day movie for yourself or the kids, this is what could have been a better produced retelling of what is China's oldest cautionary Fable, dating back thousands of years.

A great story with the usual ""well, it could have been worse"" ending that many Chinese dramas have, but there are very entertaining moments, the story is, of course, compelling and some of the characters are fun, even if they are typical caricatures of archetypes.

It's fun, though, and you end up rooting for the folks you should and booing the ones you should, like any good fable should invoke.

Sound is not fab. Dialog gets lost sometimes in the music tracks, but if you're reading the subtitles, all you need to hear is the tone and delivery. The music is okay, though the movie strives to feel Western too much, the major flaw in the production.

It's also an earlier version of using modern CGI techniques for scenes that could have been FAR better pulled off with practical special effects, especially many fight scenes. Not deftly wielded, the CGI effects cheapen the look of the film, though they were probably cheaper to use, too.

This is interesting considering that some of the sets are really good. Sometimes, the film looks beautiful, others, it looks kinda ""movie of the week"" cheap.

Still, if you don't know the actual Fable, this is a good introduction to the earliest powerful folk story in China, and so, worth seeing and on rare occasions, is rather revelatory about the origin of some icons of Chinese culture.

It may not be the best movie you ever see, but you won't hate it, either... probably fun for stoners, I'd think.",1440201600,,1633,4.688811188811189
5060933,1,B0077MFBYO,Fantasy like this isn't to my taste.,1440201600,,36,4.285714285714286
5060934,2,B0077MFBYO,"The movie had some beautiful effects, was very fairy tale like  and had the beginning of a powerful love story, but I just couldn't enjoy it because of the sexism and other negative messages. There are no good women in the story only celibate monks( beside the love interest.) This happens a lot in cultures where you have a monastic tradition that defines women as temptresses who are only trying to make men break their vows. The fears these men have about sex makes them demonize women since the only relationship they can have with a female is one of castigation and rejection.

I knew from the synopsis that the story would end sadly, but I felt only anger after watching it, not sadness. 99% of the demons were females. They were either sucking the life out of men (like sex does) or tempting the monks to have sex (and giving the male audience something to drool over.) There was only one male demon in the whole movie. The good female demon is actually bullied by the Monk for no reason. She was helping people! His prejudice drove her to behave the way she did and led to the disaster and her punishment. The male disciple who is turned into a bat demon is not hunted down or killed or threatened as she is, so I'm feeling a lot of prejudice toward women in this movie.

Nature, which is also considered feminine, gets a big hit too as mice, turtles, rabbits, foxes (who were so cute, I wanted to kiss them) bats and other creatures are made into demons and must be hunted. Nature and women are conflated in many societal myths and both must be controlled, destroyed and fought by Men/Priests/Monks. I know I have thought pretty deeply about this movie, probably too deeply, but people don't realize the power of myths and stories, look at how the story of Adam and Eve has affected the treatment of women for centuries. This is one story that does not need to be retold, it should get buried in the sands of time or if its going to be remade, remake it  into something more uplifting to men and women (like the monk gets eaten before he messes with a love that transcends the three worlds.)",1439942400,,2100,4.4467532467532465

It is a subtitled movie however script was just a supplement as the story needs little explanation. It is also a simple and moving love story between a mortal and a demon.

I had never seen this movie before but I had heard about it from a friend.  Even though this movie is not a non-stop Kung Fu action kind of film; nevertheless, the beautiful story and scenes made this a fantastic DVD to see.

This movie, like a lot of Chinese legend films, tells the story of a man who falls in love with a woman, who is actually a thousand -year old white snake.  Jet Li stars as the sorcerer monk who battles the white snake.  I never like to give away too much when reviewing a novel or a movie because it spoils it for those who may want to purchase the book or movie.  I will say this is a movie that has everything you might want in an entertaining film.  It has great fighting scenes, a wonderful love story, and a meaningful message.

In you are into martial art films which also has a great story, you should check out this DVD.  I found it to be a very entertaining film.

It doesn't try to be anything more than it is, which is visually stunning and consistently thematic. My only complaint about this production is that there are jumps in time that aren't highlighted well enough to do more than create confusion for a few minutes while your brain catches up to the story. Also they invest a lot in a couple of really fun characters early on, and then just abandon them until the final few minutes of the film.",1431302400,,606,4.568807339449541

 I usually read a 5 star then a 1 star then decide if this is a show for me. I read a dozen or so 1 star reviews after I watched the movie. So Very Glad I waited!!",1431043200,,441,3.7096774193548385

However, watching it in 4K was awesome. It's almost like active 3D without glasses. Sure things do not come out of the screen at you like 3D, but the clarity is so great, it's hard to believe you are watching TV.

5061104,4,B0077MFBYO,"I found this story to be moving. Somehow you identify with the characters and their peculiar dilemmas.  It is a love story where the couple is fated to be separated since one is a human and the other is a spirit-demon.  Here demon is some kind of contradictory idea about the nature of spiritual reality and forces.  There is a unharmonious mix of ideas which don't work but somehow the acting and basic love between the couple carries the movie.  Visually it is a feast and a lot of fun to see some Eastern myths about the spirit world and their effects on the plot. The movie is great, explains several Oriental ideas which are interesting, for example, how monks use purbas (three sided symbolic knives) to deal with spirits, how 'life essence' can work and be shared, etc. If you are interested in a fun, romantic movie or a strange mix of Eastern ideas and certain elements of Buddhism then this is a great movie.  It probably is useful in showing you an insider's view of Tantric Buddhism but I don't know enough to know which of the various Buddhist schools this represents. Anyway, some how this was a wonderful movie although it mixes all kinds of contradictions to generate visual magic and emotional reactions.",1428364800,,1221,4.6342592592592595

5061211,4,B0077MFBYO,"This is a relatively good movie and on the whole fairly entertaining.  The movie is loosely (extremely loosely) based on one of the four greatest Chinese folktails called ""Legend of the White Snake"". While they did manage to capture the essence of the story they did take a great deal of license with it.  The fight scene are very well chorographed and pretty standard epic affair for Hong Kong cinema. However if you're watching this expecting to see a lot of typical Jet Li action sequences you will be sorely disappointed as this is not a ""martial arts"" film at it's core.  The visual effects are generally well done and are used mostly to enhance the scenes though some of the smaller effects did border on ""cheesy"", overall the effects were about on par (or slightly better than) most typical Hong Kong cinema.

The dialog was quite decent, though it is sub-titled so if you're not generally interested in reading the dialog for your films you won't enjoy this one either.  However, for those of us with a better than 3rd grade reading level you will find the dialog engaging; and for me by about 15 minutes in I forgot I was reading at all as the subs are done quite well.  Just remember this is loosely based on a Chinese folktail and quite fanciful and you will enjoy the movie.",1420156800,,1286,4.545454545454546

5061286,4,B0077MFBYO,"This is less the Jet Li action film as much as it's the Jet Li ancient history film.  Special effects are amazing and will dazzle you as much as Maleficent or Avatar (many of the scenes will be recognizable in all three films).  The title should tell you more than you need to know, Jet Li being the monk sorcerer and his battle against vampires and various sorceresses, which almost sounds snake-like.  The subtitles slowly fade away as an irritation since the child-like story brings you back to a time when you were being read a bedtime story.  Serpents and demons appear, shape shifters arrive, scantily-clad temptresses are around the corner;  and through it all, Jet Li's powers are able to crumble walls and keep the rascally evil powers at bay (the bad forces are as prone to pranks as they are to nabbing people).  Shaolin monks display their combined strength, even while buried underwater (remember, this is fantasy material).  But if you're open to such, and didn't plan to watch just a series of martial arts moves, this is a fun diversion, especially (it seems) for Jet Li.

The green snake (younger sister), has the more interesting role, but the white snake is the better person. As in the original 'Painted Skin"", the Chinese morale to the story is, ""stay where you are in society/heavenly system"".

With forces from other planes of existence fighting monks on Earth, it gives a very different experience than the normal shoot-em-up.

I had low expectations since the reviews seemed rather lukewarm, but after watching it I do not understand why this is so.  It has excellent acting, a charming and humorous script, an insane a mount of epic CGI action sequences (some strain the capabilities of the animation house, but they are still quite good for an Asian movie), and impressive production values and cinematography. The only reasons I can imagine that someone wouldn't enjoy this movie is if they are not familiar with Wuxia in any way and it seems odd to them, or they did not enjoy the romance story in the movie and were hoping for even more action and straight-forward fighting.  Aside from those possibilities, there is no reason for anyone not to be swept up in this unique and well-made Wuxia film.  Highly recommended.  -TDW",1412294400,,1085,4.510204081632653

I thought the cover picture and the listing of Jet Li were promising for visual engagement.  So we rolled the dice, and we enjoyed the film a lot, even with subtitles.  I take one star away, because it's a bit tinny or cheesy at times.  This is partly the acting and partly the nature of testing love against religious values or ""right and wrong.""  However, the side story of the green snake and the apprentice is an excellent diversion that tampers some of the bigness of the title story and allows some lines to be crossed.  On a very small, personal note, the snakes looked more like plastic animals in snake form than I wanted.  I was surprised, because the rest of the visuals were so fantastic.

5061407,5,B0077MFBYO,"I don't give out 5 star reviews often. I also am not a big fan of subtitled movies. But this one grabbed my attention with the surreal world of spirits and kung fu monks and romance. It was reminiscent of a classic love story like Tristan and Isolde, but with elements best compared to the Latino ""realismo magico"" (magic realism). On the one side you have some great martial arts, some awesome choreography, fight scenes and special effects that make you wonder--and on the other side you have an incredible story of love. The spirit world elements reminded me of the Avatar: The Last Airbender TV show as well as The Legend of Korra. While I'm no expert on eastern religions, the spirit world fit in with what I know of the Animism prevalent in Asia. So it is culturally enlightening as well.

Only complaint might be that they translate the word as ""demon,"" but it seems to make more sense to use the more generic ""spirit."" I don't know enough Chinese to say whether it should be one way or the other. ""Demon"" does fit in with the monk's opinion of all the spirits as evil, but it also makes you question whether the main character is inherently evil. That is of course, a key topic of this movie. The white snake will stop at nothing to be with her love. Does that make her evil? Watch it and decide for yourself.",1405987200,,1317,4.419753086419753

It has both English subtitles and an English dubbed version.  Some reviews mentioned being distracted by having to read slow subtitles.  With the English dubbing on the Blu-ray you don't have to.  It was interesting however, that the dubbed English was sometimes quite different than the subtitles.  The gist was the same, but sort of like the differences between two Bible translations. Sometimes quite funny. On the story line, I thought it quite different that a martial arts film would have such a strongly developed romantic story line.  Something for my wife, as well as tons of action for my nine year old. (Yes, sometimes somewhat CGI overkill, but hey,what fantasy isn't nowadays?)  I thought it a classical tale on the lines of Romeo and Juliet or more recently Titanic.  The tragic love affair, you know is doomed from the start, but love can't be denied sort of thing.  I also appreciated the lack of R rating, if you know what I mean, (is rated PG-13), for my 9 year old.",1405209600,2,1115,4.676923076923077

Featuring fine acting, great effects, wild fistfights and epic cinematography, this movie's real strength comes from the surprisingly touching and doomed romance between a man and a demon.

Usually these stories state that societal rules concerning have been set up and no one can bend them for any reason or the punishment will be swift and eternal. Could also be that star-crossed lovers make for better storytelling.

5061446,5,B0077MFBYO,"Although it's a fantasy movie based on a legend, this movie does have a great storyline that includes the clear, real message, that the Supreme Creator WILL be there to help you in times of severe Spiritual attack, IF you live within the ""Light"" of His Divinity (as Fa Hai the sorcerer Monk clearly does).  This message also clearly applies to our own every-day lives as well.  And the movie also has fantastic visual effects.

I struggled to keep from crying in the last 50-minutes of it because despite this being a fantasy movie, there were several real-life metaphysical & Spiritual messages in it that  are very powerful, as were the painful lessons in True-Love between SuSu the shape-shifting White Snake Demon and her human Husband Xu Xian.

Thus the last words of a beautiful song during their last moments together: ""...we'll meet again in our next lives"", beautifully describes one of the most serious conclusions in this movie: the Love between SuSu & Xu Xian is so strong, that Reincarnation & the Holy Creator will bring them together again in their next lifetime, when she will possibly be given the Divine Blessing to be born fully human.

Yet in real-life, Reincarnation is a very well-documented and proven metaphysical & Spiritual phenomenon.  And nearly all of us knows of an elder relative or friend who described a particular child as ""An old soul..."" and ""That one's definitely been HERE before!"" Most of us also know of someone who was madly in love with another person who was simply NOT good for themyet they were madly in love anyway, but eventually had to part forever.  Erika Badus love-song [I Guess Ill See You] Next Lifetime strongly applies here.

 All the characters were very believable in their roles, the acting was properly emotional to each scene (romantic, funny, sad, serious) not hammy / overdone, and I applaud Jet Li, Eva Huang, Raymond Lam, & Wen Ziang, for their great acting as the supreme Monk, the White Snake, the Naturopathic Herbalist, and the Apprentice-Monk / Gargoyle.

I wouldn't go in to it thinking you're going to watch a kung fu type movie, though there are some awesome fight scenes.  There is a great ""forbidden romance"" that goes on that the film centralizes on. Personally, I am not a huge fan of romantic movies, but this one wasn't so bad because of the fantastical/mythical aspects.  Being a fantasy movie, one can expect that there will be plenty of special effects involved.  The effects in this movie were stellar in my opinion; probably not as first-class as those of higher budget films, but believable, and many times, beautiful.",1399680000,,688,4.708333333333333

The visual effects fall short of realism, making me say ""Really?"" many times.

He travels into the countryside of ancient China to collect wild herbs for his tonics and medicines to help his town survive the deadly plague that is killing hundreds in his region. While on a journey with some friends into a new region, the men are secretly studied by two Chinese ""Snake Goddesses"". Similar to the bewitching powers of the European ""Mermaids of the Seas"", these young Snake Goddesses can also captivate human men with their power & charms. The White Snake Goddess, however, chooses not to drown or harm the young herbalist that she saves from a fall into the wild currents of the river. She cannot forget him, nor can he forget her.
She takes on ""human form"" although doing so will drain away some of her ancient ""essence"", or life force.  She even chooses to secretly blow her 'magic essence' in her breath upon her lover's cooked medicines, giving him the magic ingredient to save his people. Is their love doomed because of their differences of being different creatures in the olden struggle of good vs.evil. There are many mystical creatures and demons from the ancient legends of China woven throughout this movie. The Buddist monks are locked in an ancient struggle to save the people of their region from all the ""demons and evil ones"". Many strange battles are fought for control. Will the White Snake Goddess stay with her lover, or will she return to her ancient mystical lands once more? Will the Head Monk and his helpers defeat the evil creatures that prey upon mankind?

Filmed in very much the same fashion as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Sorcerer and The White Snake  follows the lives of a physician, Xu Xian and Susu, the serpent demon who falls in love with him. But in a very operatic plot twist, their love is forbidden. Abbott Fahai and his assistant Neng Ren are sent to do battle with a bat demon and in doing so become acquainted with this couple's predicament.

The climax of the story builds on greater loves - showing how the white snake, a demon, only played at human love. Her true nature was dangerous and destructive, ultimately selfish. However, she learned the greatest of loves, the forgiveness and mercy of the Bhudda.
How often do movies revel in the light of divine love?
The visuals were stunning as well. The martial arts were excellent, the cast beautiful, and all so well acted.

5061538,5,B0077MFBYO,"This is one of the most beautiful love stories ever made in film. The passion for a Pure Love was carried to the far end of its imagination in this epic fantasy, retold from some darkly folklores in ancient China, which were partly written to ' Awaken ' people concerning the Hidden Evils in the world.

There are some especially haunting scenes in this film, like the charming smiles of the white snake beauty with floating hairs underwater, well accompanied by the sad and lovely music alongside. Then it was mischievously ruined by the following image of a guy's protruding lips.

The final embrace in the ending scenes is as perfect and tragic as it could be along with the poignant love song. Watching it in light colors and brighter, softer pictures makes it look like a Classic Romance in film history. The sky, landscape, pagoda, characters, dialogue, and music, all come together perfectly in one beautiful touching moment across space and time, like carrying you way back to an Ancient Oriental Dreamland.

The fighting sequences were also gorgeously done, especially in the opening icy scenes, and the spectacular ending battles between the monk sorcerer and the two snake sisters. Not highly sophisticated, but splendidly attractive.

Besides cinematography, the film also has something very thoughtful to say. In the beginning it has warned through the Buddha Master : "" Do not believe in what your eyes see so easily. "" ( direct translation )

The cold feeling you feel may not be natural but a spell. The one you love dearly may be a transformation of a snake creature with a shady history behind ..... and so on. Such cautions were said to be the original intent of him who wrote the whitesnake tale, and dozens of other moral stories, hundreds of years ago.

In some later versions and this modern film, however, the moral was changed to suggest that True Love, even sexual love, is possible between a human and an alien creature with no bad consequences, if not for the rigid prohibition of some Buddha-like Powers. Seriously, such thinking is obviously naive without a real case of alien species and all the facts to examine thoroughly.

Another myth is : Why would two beings love each other so deeply after so short a time togehter without knowing much about each other ?
Is such impossible blind love desirable anyway as a concept ?

Coming back to reality, any relationship shrouded in ignorance, deception, selfishness, possessiveness, invasiveness, and violence will make any sense of Genuine Goodness a Pure Delusion. Some more realistic questions are : WHAT exactly do you love about someone ? How far will you love someone as he or she changes, or the circumstances ? At what costs ?  And who would test your love and break your heart, if not a devil ?

In summary, this film may best be described as a tragic romantic comedy-fantasy, joining the many supernatural horror films in this Alien New Age.",1390176000,,2928,4.814741035856573

5061557,3,B0077MFBYO,"I had no problem with the highly made up special effects. I like sci-fi/action flicks and the somewhat far fetched explosions and fight scenes reminded me of similar unbelievable Western action movies. I am also a Chinese-American, so I can relate to the background and backdrop of the story. Chinese drama films usually center around love--more often than not, love that cannot be. Sacrifice and love beyond death are familiar themes. This movie was similar in that the main character couple (the herbalist and snake-lady) have a forbidden love from the start. If the movie stayed the course of teh first 2/3 of the movie--action and light-hearted romance with some comedic parts mixed in--I would have enjoyed the whole film. However, the last 1/3 of the movie which wrapped up the storyline became way to juvenile to me. The snake-lady is stabbed by her husband (who did not recognize her in snake form), where he then goes to steal an herb to heal her. Unfortunately, that herb is the only thing holding all the bad demons that have been caught. His love is so overflowing, he still steals the herb, but it engulfed by the bad demons. The snake-lady attacks the monastery where the monks are trying to invoke a spell to purge the evil demons. She continues to attack and attack, flooding the whole land because she wants to see her true love. This came off as very selfish and juvenile from her. For someone who has lived thousands of years and supposedly meditated for 1000 years, you would think that she wouldn't be so hasty to inflict so much damage on hundreds of people to just see her love one more time (who may be harmed by the breaking of the spell anyways). Even though she finally succumbs to the greater power of ...Buddha? or possibly global chi/energy? that heals the monk (Jet Li) and claims that she will accept any punishment if she can just see her love one more time--after she does get to see him, they still both scrabble at each other as she is pulled away to due her penance in the monastery's pagoda.

All in all, I would the movie recommend to pass the time, but at the end, I often was cringing at selfish and sappy actions and felt decidedly happy when the snake-lady was punished.",1389139200,,2213,4.616751269035533

5061570,4,B0077MFBYO,"This is what happens when modern movie technology gets used to update a classic folk tale. The legend of the green and white serpents has been around since before the Ming Dynasty, so there are a lot of variations in the story. This version puts a much kinder spin on the monk (Jet Li). Much like the earlier versions of the story, which were a straight morality tale about the evils of demons and the kindness of monks, his motivation is to save the hapless Xu Xian. However, much like the later more romantic versions, the White Lady is motivated by love for Xu Xian. So this is a lot more nuanced than any of the more 'normal' legends in which either the snake or the monk are painted as 'the villain.' Just don't go in expecting an action film. It's really more of a romance with kung fu in it.",1388361600,,798,4.291390728476821

I liked the fact that at the end, the sorcerer realized the world was not black and white.

I wished the end of the story would have reunited Xu Xian and Susu (the white snake), just as the most popular folk version did (Qinging came back after 18 years of training and defeated the sorcerer, released Susu from the temple).

The story line is a classic one of white snake and green snake wanting to become human and has been told and re-told many times.

5061626,3,B0077MFBYO,"The special effects of this film were superb and Jet-Li has proven that he is more than a kung-fu action actor.  Where this film failed is on the grounds of understanding purity of heart despite differences within nature.  I disliked how it was a problem for a so-called demon to be in love with a human even after the human discovered it's true identity and still wanted to be with her.  But, it's ok for Jet Li's apprentice to roam free as a newly transformed bat demon.  Quite hypocritical considering that the snake demons were not malevolent in intention.  As it is said, true love has no boundaries, and this concept of balance has truly missed the mark.  Jet Li's character was very selfish in his views as he failed to realized the snake demon was pure of heart in her intentions, just as any human is when they fall in love, to sum love up as being a spell is to say that no true love really exist and any view of love is just an illusion born of selfish belief.  If this is so, then, all who protect out of love are selfish and spell-casters as well.  But, what could be further from the truth than this twisted and mundane view of love and intent, very derogatory and mocking in meaning.  Humans are a type of animal or animation, as in animated spirit type, just as snakes, bats, wolves, insects, microbes, etc., not to be confused with promoting a beastiality view of interrelations.  Indeed, this is no ordinary snake it was a snake that could exist as a human, no more a monster than any human that would choose to exist as a blood thirst barbarian in character making she/he anything but human by behavior.  If humans can love dogs, cats, rats, fish, etc., and hold certain animals in high regard on par with humans, then, where is the dilemma? lol  Hate to come off as as a prude, but placing human values at the center of cosmic balance is nothing more than the continued misconceptions of the human ego roaring it's ugly head.  As they say, art imitates life.  As so, judging by the history of human kind we have no room to point the finger at other perspectives of existence when humans have so much negative baggage when it comes to existing in a harmonious manner.  Hope I didn't spoil this for any, but this films concept comes off as the typical is the glass half empty or half full brain tease with either side claiming to have the correct view.  But how I see it, the glass being half empty or half full is not what's important, what's important is the glass itself that gives the optical presentation of either view.  If the glass becomes broken then, either view would lose it's significant perspective.  The glass is the retainer of truth not the content or the lack thereof.  Humility of a positive perspective humbles the mind and grows the wisdom of the heart.  For any awaken ones who understands my perspective this is purely about seeing beyond stagnant boundaries and differences, this indeed translates in the every day human affairs over race, color, creed, religion, etc...

5061633,2,B0077MFBYO,"For years now I have been a Jet Li fan. He has always been exciting to watch, even if the films he has been in weren't that great. As time has gone by though he has gotten better and the films he chooses to be apart have gotten better. So, when I went to watch The Sorcerer and the White Snake I was not expecting to watch a movie that would use up two hours of my time the way being stuck in traffic does. I know I watched a film with Jet Li, but I didn't see Jet li. What I saw was a cheap candy coated dose of twisted Chinese legends with an unclear pseudo religious message.

 The story follows two characters, a demon who is a white snake lady and a monk, who hunts demons. The white snake is named Susu, played by Huang Shengyi, and she has a sister, the green snake, Qingqing, played by Charlene Choi. They decide to make some friendly trouble for a group of humans traveling in their neighborhood. The humans are collecting herbs for medicines and are being lead by a young man who wants to be a doctor, Xu Xian, played by Raymond Lam. During this little escapade of the snake sisters, Susu falls in love with Xu Xian and decides to try to seduce him and live in the world of humans. She gets Qingqing to help her in this endeavor during a village festival in the town that Xu Xian lives in, which puts Qingqing in contact with her own human interest. Long story short, Susu succeeds in winning Xu Xian's love and they get married and begin building a life together.
 The second main character is the Abbot Fahai, played by Jet Li. The good Abbot is roaming about the countryside with his apprentice Neng Ren, played by Wen Zhang, hunting demons. When they find demons they defeat them in combat and suck their souls into a holy bowl to take back to the monastery. There the souls are trapped in a huge mirror that acts like a prison for demons, think General Zod in the original Superman. The Abbot is hunting down fox demons when he encounters Susu and her husband who are battling an infection spread among the people of the village by the same fox demons. Susu helps Xu Xian develop a cure for the disease with her demon spit. Fahai, after dispatching the fox demons, turns his attention to Susu. He tells her that since she helped the people he won't hurt her, but she must leave her husband, as her marriage is a lie. Demons can't love after all. She refuses and thus a war between the Abbot Fahai and the snake sisters ensue.

 I would like to write a paragraph about what was good with this movie, but I am not interested in working that hard. First and foremost, this film was sold on it's looks, and those looks just aren't that great. The movie is heavy with CGI and none of it really good. Neng Ren is turned into a demon and looks more like the old Japanese manga Devilman. The actresses playing the snakes are beautiful women, but when attached to the snake bodies it looks like the CGI continues up on to their faces, making them look CGI as well. It actually takes a lot away from their natural beauty. The final fight scene involves a lot of water and the animators manage to ruin the realistic look of crushing waves. The effects just end up being see through candy coating, like fake chocolate covering corn syrup.

 The writing is weak as well. First there are the romance scenes between Susu and Xu Xian, all of which seems forced, over the top cliches. There is no belief in love established here. Second, the dialogues between Fahai and Neng Ren, which I think are supposed to be funny, just aren't. The dialgues between Fahai and Susu, which include threats and aggression, are deadpan. Jet Li, who I know can be funny, is not and he is not even threatening when he is giving Susu her ultimatum. Then, there is the interactions between Neng Ren and Qingqing. It appears Qingqing when wants a human of her own she goes after poor Brother Neng Ren. This is all supposed to be cute and funny and it fails miserably. That doesn't stop them from at the end having a demon Neng Ren comfort his lovely snake girlfriend after she is beaten by Fahai. Very unbelievable sorrow. Last, there is the ending itself, where the script ties itself into knots.

 I don't mind telling you this as I am recommending you don't bother watching this film, unless you need a laxative. The Abbot wishes to see Susu punished for not ending her marriage. Fahai kidnaps Xu Xian to erase all memory of Susu from his mind. Susu tries to stop this in the final battle. It is only when she agrees with Buddha, yes Buddha, that she renounce her marriage and spend her time for her crimes, which is apparently getting married and helping people, that the Buddha allows her to say good bye to her husband. She is then locked away in the demon prison in hopes of being reborn as something better than a demon. Fahai, sees he has been too cruel and indiscriminate in his demon hunting and chooses to be a more a peaceful guy by making sure the demons he hunts really deserve it. He even takes along the newly demonized Neng Ren to show his new turned leaf to the world.

 All throughout this film we are exposed to religious imagery through the poor CGI. So much so, that I began to wonder if Jet Li made this film solely to sell Buddhism. The problem is the religious message, if there is one, is not clear. What is clear wouldn't sell Buddhism very well. All the demons, except Neng Ren, are women, good looking women. They tempt Fahai at every turn and like the Buddha avoiding temptation under the Bodhi tree Fahai chants his way through their sexy beastly dances. Fahai accuses Susu that her love is a lie and she just used magic to seduce poor Xu Xian in to marriage. The message I am exposing is one that suggests women are treacherous, seducers who led men astray. At the end Fahai realizes that Susu's love was real and he is generous enough to wish her well during her time in demon prison. So, the message can be summed up that women are damned if they do and damned if they don't. Archaic modes of cultural thinking that had nothing to do with real Buddhism is what Jet Li let slip into his film. Now, maybe all this was apart of the original legend, I would say that matters little as well. The Chinese, like many other cultures, attached their own beliefs and ideas to the teachings brought back home by silk road travelers like Xaunzang. We all know what Buddha said about attachment, don't we?

 In conclusion, don't watch this. Find something else, an older Jet Li film, or a live action movie without cartoon effects, or a story based on something besides a legend that sounds more like a poorly written manga.",1379462400,4,6623,4.383550488599348

5061636,4,B0077MFBYO,"This is a charming fantasy loaded with special effects that never overpower the story based on a Chinese legend. If you're expecting a Jet Li  man-to-man martial arts film, you might be disappointed because here he's fighting demons and repelling their evil deeds and he's pretty good at it. You can read about the plot elsewhere. I want to concentrate on the visual/audio aspects of the film. Last night we downloaded it on Netflix and enjoyed it a lot. Only the Chinese soundtrack was available which was OK for us since we watch lots of foreign films so reading subtitles doesn't bother us. While the video and surround sound was impressive, unfortunately the small and white subtitles against white and light backgrounds were impossible to read at times causing gaps in following the plot.

Some reviews on Blu-ray sites complained about the Blu-ray's video quality made me apprehensive about purchasing it. Today I bought this Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy combo and played the Blu-ray. On both discs there is an English dubbed soundtrack done with DTS-HD on the Blu-ray and Dolby Digital 5.1 on the DVD and both sound great on your home theater system. Subtitles on both discs are bigger and easier to read than on the Netflix version. The English dialogue is clear while the dubbed voices sound like how the characters should sound with their words synchronized to their lips.

The video quality is another matter. I have to agree with Blu-ray.com's reviewer that  ""the image is a bit on the soft side--with the heavy grain structure obscuring what might otherwise be fine detail--but from a normal viewing distance this isn't really an issue, unless you're watching via projector or on an extremely large screen."" It's not a bad picture but for some reason, unless my memory is playing tricks on me, the Nextflix version was sharper. I played parts of the DVD for comparison and overall it was slightly better if not the same when upscaled to 1080P. Either disc will not disappoint you unless you're too fussy about video quality and anyway you won't notice these 'imperfections' once you're absorbed by the story which happens within the first minute. I just don't understand why the Netflix version had better video, at least to me. Can anyone explain this?

These same reviewers complained about the ""outdated"" CGI effects lacking detail and texture but I thought their old-style cartoonish aspect worked well with the fairy tale plot. If you like these kind of effects-heavy fantasies, this one's for you. What sets this one apart from the others is that it's really a love story and the bad guys or in this case the demons aren't so bad. Everyone has their reasons for behaving the way they do including our hero Li whose character is a bit on the stolid side with his religious beliefs that make him have no choice in breaking apart a pair of mismatched lovers. And what a pair as you'll see....",1377820800,,2904,4.846774193548387

He is very strict about his duty. Eventually he must challenge her. In  many way's you feel sorry for her because she is not all that bad ( I didn't give away anything here).

Xu Xian falls in love with Susu and Abbott Fahai naturally becomes concerned as to the spiritual balance that is going to play out among other men and women living nearby. Jet Li gives a strong effort in his role to help bring spiritual balance. Huang Shengyi, Raymond Lam, Wen Zhang, and Charlene Choi play significant parts to the plot as well.

5061660,3,B0077MFBYO,"I just got the DVD the other day & watched it. As a fan (me) of 80/90's Hong Kong ""new wave"" cinema, I was already familiar with Tsui Hark's GREEN SNAKE (1993), which I used to reference this film so I already knew the storyline as I was viewing this.
Thus, it is a pretty good ""REdo"" of that earlier 93 version, clearly meant to appeal to today's younger audiences.
My only complaint is the OVERLY excessive use of CGI, where the ""martial-action"" scenes was concerned. Couldn't the film-makers have just used the traditional ""wire work"" against genuine, not ""animated"" (outdoors/indoor settings) backdrops? That's what made Director Ching Sui Tung (I don't call him ""Tony"", LOL!)famous in HK & got him started in the business in the first place. That & some (then impressive)-jaw-dropping stunt work!
Also, the product descript says the disc's (film's) language is ""Cantonese""- it is NOT! It's in Mandarin! Tho U may hear some Cantonese spoken in the ""behind the scenes"" featurettes.
Lastly- Y is the film titled, ""Sorceror and....""??? Jet Li's character is NOT a ""sorceror"", he's a MONK!!!!
Tho, I can guess that...???... if it were titled, ""The Monk and the White Snake"" it would not be as ""commercially"" appealing. ;-)
So fans NOT familiar with 90's HK cinema, U'll have to have an 'open mind' in watching this- this is NOT a ""Bruce Lee-style Kung Fu"" flick or any of Jet Li's prior ""kick-ass"" martial arts films! It's a Chinese fantasy film, set in period times.
So those prior reviewers already confused by the storyline probly wouldn't understand Tsui's GREEN SNAKE either! ;-D",1371600000,,1584,4.87037037037037

5061662,3,B0077MFBYO,"I really enjoyed watching this once, the storyline had real integrity, and Jet Li was fun to watch in all the action sequences. I especially enjoyed the opening sequence of the straightforward fight with the Bad Demoness.

I really enjoyed seeing the two snake sisters, Susu and QingQing working together for their combat sequences, and their relationship was really entertaining. The basic story was really solid, the effects were fun, if sometimes a little cheesy, and the theme of the how demonkind and humankind shouldn't mix was solid through...

... but being an American watching a Chinese romance, that whole 'the two lovers can never *stay* happy together* was pretty evident and less satisfying for me than it probably was for the original audience. The need to comply to 'ones own kind' and the whole thread of how Susu's love was selfish by Buddhist/Chinese standards was really clear. I can see why it worked out the way it did, but I really liked Jet Li's character's voiced doubts near the end. I just wasn't particularly happy with how it worked out, and am glad I only rented it.",1370822400,24,1096,4.824468085106383
5061663,4,B0077MFBYO,"If you were to compare this fantasy asian movie to a similarly themed American release I would put it up against the (much unfairly maligned) film ""Van Helsing"".  If you were a Hugh Jackman ""Wolverine"" fan and went into ""Van Helsing"" expecting or hoping to see Jackman portray at least a Wolverinish character you'd probably be a bit disappointed; so too here if you're a Jet Li fan expecting to see the famed Hong Kong actor playing a well-practiced martial artist who is going to show off his martial skills, you're going to be disappointed.  Li does play a buddhist monk with martial skills but they generally comprise a lot of his swirling his arms and being catapulted along wires in a fantasy spectacle wherein he hunts a variety of demonic beings who are torturing and killing humans.

The eponymous white snake is one such demon who has fallen in love with a human medicine man and ends up coming into conflict with the unrelenting Li.  For the sake of her love for the human she and her sister companion go behemoth Godzilla size as they fight with the protective monks who seek to undo or banish them from the realm of humanity and they unleash calamity upon villages; it's quite a spectacle and the special effects are well done and should please the general western audience who would be into this sort of thing.  Like many of the higher quality Hong Kong pictures it is at times exquisitely beautiful but if you're not a fan of eastern (specifically asian) fantasy then a lot of what goes on in the flick might make you groan or scratchy your head in trying to make sense of why some of the behaviors and actions are occurring (one word to cover it all: ""magic""); this element, where narrative can be easily thrown out the window, can easily turn off a viewer.

And so it was for me though I am a fan of Li and these types of fantastical fantasy movies (anyone ever see old Saturday afternoon TV fare of ""The Magic Serpent""? it's out there and I loved that and this movie is similar in some respects).  I love the effects, the cinematography.  Li's calm cool charisma doesn't translate so well in this outing, though, and his talents are fairly wasted IMO here.  The love story at the heart of the movie is both confusing and oddly compelling and, as in many traditional Chinese yarns, there is a strong element of tragedy here.

Overall this isn't a must for Jet Li fans but should be generally worth it for fantasy fans, especially those people raised on ""Avatar"" and other such specifically asian cartoons and fantasy.  I would recommend the Blu-ray for this release as the colors are really going to pop.  3.75 stars.",1370563200,2,2634,4.56900212314225

A branch of the storyline, meeting the White Snakes parents, was entirely removed. This also required rewording the end rescue of the green snake by the dragon demon-monk. Still a good film, but unnecessary cuts damage it.

5061681,5,B0077MFBYO,"I am very impressed with the film's delicate interspersion of Love and devotion in the fantasy world envisioned by Director Siu-Tung Ching

It has so many interwoven layers of Buddhist belief structures adapted to a story of true Love between a truly altruistic man and a virtually immortal demon.

Jet-Li, as the sorcerer monk, provides a superb performance as the voice of reason in this chaotic realm's setting.

While the 'entrance card' to this film could have been limited to a focus on the martial arts and the role they could play in a simplistic scenario of good versus evil, the film is so much more than that!

One of the other reviewers most correctly notes that a lack of understanding of fundamental Buddhist philosophy could be a barrier to the appreciation of the film's accomplishments to some viewers.  I concur wholeheartedly with that assessment.

There is a book on applied Buddhist Psychology titled 'The Misleading Mind' which some might find helpful in learning how to live a happier more fulfilling life.

The Sorcerer (Jet Li)does not condone the presence of the white snake demon, even though she helps humans. This blends the lines of good and evil.

The film is magnificently done. The contrasting bright colors are distinctively oriental while the soundtrack at times is western, especially the demon music. The special effects were good, although the large CG snake was clearly CG.

This movie reminds me of Tales from the Darkside: the Movie in which the third story is the best. It concerns a young man who witnesses a gargoyle savagely kill a man in a dark alley. Man makes vow to never speak of gargoyle to anyone in exchange for his life. Romantic tale ends in shock and horror, wonder and amazement.

The legend of the White Snake is believed to date from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

One of the challenges of viewing this legend from the US is our understanding of the world is based largely in physics and the physical. As with many classic Asian tales from Japan and China, their world is often a world of unseen forces, driven by godlike creatures, much more akin to Greek mythology than any tales of U.S. origin. Whereas with Aesop's fables wherein most of the characters, mostly animals are representations of human drives or aspects of human natures, many of the characters in Japanese and Chinese mythology represent forces of nature.

So too, in the legend of the White Snake, the characters represent forces in nature, deity-like creatures which for many Asians are not fictional. The world around us is alive with spirits that have an impact on our lives and believing this, such stories as Kurosawa's Dreams can be truly terrifying for people raised in that world.

It was a cautionary tale of love between humans and demons, an exploration of the Jet Li's assumptions (as the head of a buddhist monastery), a demonstration of faith by the buddhist monks, and a beautiful but subtle revelation of layers of buddhist belief, which unfortunately will be missed by the average american viewer.

5061704,2,B0077MFBYO,"This movie was pretty cool visually, and was driven by a dramatic and mythical story. I watch a lot of foreign films and especially enjoy Asian films, but main love story that develops in The Sorcerer and the White Snake is sort of ridiculous when factoring in all the mythological interpretation displayed throughout the film. This would have been a much more thrilling film had the story been more martial arts focused with a secondary romantic text.",1362873600,,452,4.883116883116883

Also, it is common for such a culture to choose death over forgiveness....not to love over the so called Warrior Way. The movie punished Love, rejected forgiveness, and forsaked wisdom over stubborness. I HATED THE MOVIE FOR ITS BAD MESSAGES.",1362614400,6,415,4.777777777777778
5061706,3,B0077MFBYO,the ideas were good but the execution was formulaic.  Nothing new so I say watch it if you have a evening with nothing else to do.,1362441600,,130,4.0
5061707,1,B0077MFBYO,"This whole thing is a mess, one that may have a very colorful palette and is full of weird off beat ideas, but absolutely no spirit or convection. The Sorcerer and the White Snake suffers from an over load of unconvincing CGI effects, which dominate nearly every moment on screen, but that is just the tip of the preverbal ice berg,  as a story it has no clear idea just what in he hell it is about.

 The Sorcerer and the White Snake is said to based on a Chinese folktale. Alright, I can see that, what I can't see is the focus that is being attempted here. Large portions of this movie play out like across between Walt Disney and Run Run Shaw, with it's kung fu fighting monks and it's talking animals which includ a turtle, a rat and  a cute little bunny rabbit, no kidding. But  it is also a fantasy adventure with touches of the supernatural as demons from the neither world try to infiltrate our world. But at it's core it appears to be a story of forbidden love. These elements never really mesh, resulting in part because it is never able to find a satisfying tone that it can stick with.

 The main story has an herbalist named Xu Xian (Raymond Lam) falling in a lake with some help and nearly drowning, but is saved by a charming snake woman (Eva Huang).  He  falls in love with her, perhaps under some sort of spell, she takes human form and become his lover. While her sister (Charlene Choi), also a snake woman, falls for a young monk (Zhang Wen) who is slowly turning into a bat demon himself after an unsuccessful confrontation with an array of monsters.

 Jet Li, the latest Expendables alumni to have a disastrous new movie on his hands, appears here as a demon fighting monk. Li seems as if he's in a different movie altogether from the one taking center stage. I guess this should really come as no surprise given that Li has said that he was tricked into making this movie. The only publicity I have heard him give to this movie, that unto itself is not only a bad sign, but more than marginally uncomfortable.

 The whole picture is a miss match of bad ideas which not surprisingly fail. It is very cornball and constantly laughable in all the wrong spots. On top of that the attempted comedy which is very lame and nearly never funny. The effects take precedence over everything else, but they are terrible, silly and cheap looking, The whole world of the Sorcerer and the White Snake is a computer created fiasco, never for a moment is it convincing in the least, it all looks like a drawing done by a third grader. The make-up of the monk changing into a bat demon is the most uncomfortable looking bad job I've seen in a movie in ages. This is perhaps the silliest fantasy film in decades.

 Also as an action movie, the Sorcerer and the White Snake fails even more miserably, if you can imagine that, as their isn't a whole lot of action on the screen, it takes nearly a quarter of the movie's running time before any martial arts action is seen at all. Add to it, the silliness of the plot and the crude make-up that will almost certainly have you laughing, as I did. This is not what I'd call a good time at the movies, it is almost as awkward and embarrassing for an audience to behold as it must have been to make.

 The storyline if you will notice is a lot like Ron Howard's Splash, it's also a bit like the Little Mermaid with a slap dash of Kung Fu Panda. Now with sources that varied can you not see how this gets all muddled. However, this sort of bold genre crossing is fascinating in it's own way and given this story the picture could have had some off beat charm.

 The Sorcerer and the White Snake does get a little bit of life brought out of it by the wonderful Chinese actress Charlene Choi, perhaps the most adorable woman in the movies today anywhere in the world. Choi has a certain spunkiness to her and it all comes across nicely in her performance. However, she has terrible material to work with first, and second she only has a a supporting role. She isn't allowed to fully reach her potential, but she manages to be the only interesting performer on screen and the film comes the most to life when she is on screen.

 Directed by action cheoragropher Tony Ching, who has done some admirable directing jobs in the past. But here he is unsuccessful in his approach, the material must have been a pain to have had to work with.  In the past he has tackled martial arts fantasy, so well, that it is awfully hard to believe he is the creative mind behind this unintelligible dreck. As the man behind the well received minor classic A Chinese Ghost Story and the little  seen, inside the U.S. at least, but wonderful Jet Li star vehicle Dr. Wei in the Scriptures With No Words, it's easy to have to assume that the weak material is at fault. I hardly think any film director could pull this off, so Ching can't be faulted except for attempting to make something at all out of this.

  It is just hooey to think that critics like all foreign language films, we have enough bad films of our own we don't need to import them from other nations. Why the director and star didn't have their names removed is beyond me, but then again why exactly the Sorcerer and the White Snake is being given a decent American release when so many fine Asian films still go without distribution in the United States baffles me even further.

The storyline was somewhat simplistic but this is a fantasy and oh yes, lest we forget, a martial arts film, if you want substance look elsewhere.

That being said, I cannot offer an opinion on how well the storyline follows the ancient myth but I can say that I enjoyed this filmessage immensely. It was visually enthralling, I loved the acting and I am a sucker for mythical love stories,  lol. I would love it if this were to be released on disk in 3D or at least in 4k. But for now I will purchase it as a blue ray disk and it will upscale on my 4k player. I'll definitely re-watch this film.
P.S. The only thing that I would have preferred would have been a more accurate title. Instead of calling it The ""Sorcerer"" and the White Snake it should have been The Monk and White Snake.",1487808000,,750,4.208333333333333

Gorgeous scenery, cinematography, and special effects, good acting, but mystical concepts are hardly profound, simplistic in the extreme.  Annoyed that I bought this before viewing based on the good reviews and then found it idiotic and a waste of time.  Dialogue is inane.  It's a very pretty package with little in it, perhaps okay for older children, with the caveat that nearly all the evil demons are female, mostly young women, while the victors/people with scruples are male Buddhist monks.
