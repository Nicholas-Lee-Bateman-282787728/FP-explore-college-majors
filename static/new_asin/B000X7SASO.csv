8227114,1,B000X7SASO,"I am ex- U.S. Army Airborne (paratrooper) and I have had several articles published in Soldier Of Fortune magazine [...]. The founder / editor / publisher of Soldier Of Fortune magazine is a famous Vietnam era Green Beret and a personal friend. He also has a patent on the name and had licensed it out on occasion - but does not recall licensing this film (but is looking into it).

The DVD I received was some REALLY CHEAP BLACK MARKET COPY WHERE THE SOUND DID NOT MATCH THE MOUTHS. I couldn't believe Brandon Lee was even in it because it was so bad.",1335830400,,552,4.359223300970874
