8282548,5,B001BBH67W,You will notice this is not called the best of Martial arts.  And its not. You can almost see the wires in some scenes and the plot lines are so corny as to actually detract from the action.  That being said its an awesome view into the society it was made for.  The movies on here are so funny you just can't help but enjoy them.,1376784000,,330,3.9696969696969697
8282549,1,B001BBH67W,This anthology of Yuen Wo Ping kung fu movies is a huge let down as there are no spectacular fight sequences in any of the films found here. Great disappointment.,1373068800,,162,4.433333333333334
8282550,3,B001BBH67W,"Whenever I buy volume 2 of these type of sets, I have a bit of a let-down.  There are maybe 2 good flicks on this set.  The best thing about these type of collections is if you get them cheap enough that the price is about the same as it is for that one movie missing from your collection, you get 5 bonus movies. Yuen Wo Ping Vol 1 and Drunken Masters Vol 1 were both super.  Both vol. 2's are not worth it if you crave more of the same.  And there are so many repackages of this stuff that you should make sure you don't already own them.",1364515200,,540,3.881818181818182
8282551,5,B001BBH67W,Just finished watching this! It was so awesome! Some really original fight scenes are in here. Yeun Wo Ping is so awesome!!! Totally recommend this!,1226188800,2,148,4.96
