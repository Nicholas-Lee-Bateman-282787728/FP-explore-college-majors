1675203,5,B00005Y6Y3,"Desperate to leave the dreary confines of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, loner Moonie Pottie (Liane Balaban) seeks help from a teacher Mr. Sweeney (brilliantly played by Andrew McCarthy). A supportive (thought slightly lecherous) friend, he helps her win a scholarship to a school in New York City. Unfortunately, Moonie's strict Irish Catholic parents will hear nothing of their 15 year old daughter moving to New York.

When Moonie teams up with another outsider named Lou (Tara Spencer-Nairn), a newcomer to Cape Breton from NYC, they devise an outrageous plan to help Moonie escape. Besides being the champion of Moonie's ambitions, Lou becomes a hilarious force to be reckoned with when less than gentlemanly males betray the girls of the town.

""New Waterford Girl"" perfectly captures the nuances of growing up in the 70's with sympathetic, believable characters that might have been clich?d with a less talented writer. Few ""coming of age"" movies manage to blend laughs with reality this perfectly.",1147219200,2,1000,5.24375

I watched it with my friend, who said it sucked. It didn't. I missed the first 15 minutes however, which probably made the whole movie. Excellent either way.",1137369600,2,295,4.481481481481482
1675205,5,B00005Y6Y3,"Film doesn't get much better than Alan Moyle's very original ""New Waterford Girl"". That said, prospective viewers should understand that ""New Waterford Girl"" withholds much of its pleasure from the first viewing, be prepared to watch it at least three times which is not difficult because it is one of those films with unexpected depth that gets better with each viewing. Even your reaction to the cinematography will change with each viewing as the unremittingly grim visuals (subjects are often framed against gray skies and windswept beaches) which initially make you shiver become increasing beautiful.

The DVD is broken down into 16 scenes, which are more like film segments because each contains several actual scenes. What separates ""New Waterford Girl"" from most films is how well each of these 16 segments works in isolation.  Watch them individually to fully appreciate the perfect direction, shot selection, score, and production design that underlies this wonderful film.

The main character, 15 year old Moonie (Liane Balaban), is one of those freaks of genetics who occasionally spring up in unexpected places, whose comparative intelligence and ambition set them apart from family and peers. She loves her family but has simply outgrown the small Nova Scotia town of New Waterford and dreams of getting out. Once engaged and observant, she now drifts around town with her face in a book, having written off and distanced herself from everyone around her. Boys are attracted to Mooney (plausible since Balaban looks like a cross between Natalie Portman and Winona Rider) but she is focused on getting out rather than on boys. It is a dream part, as Balaban through behavior and voice-over must somehow balance Moonie's generally unpleasant demeanor and too soon maturity with the fragility and vulnerability of a young girl.

Enter new next door neighbor Lou Benzoa (Tara Spencer-Nairn) who has just moved to New Waterford from the Bronx with her mother (Cathy Moriarty). In homage to Moriarty's ""Raging Bull"" character, Lou's father is a jailed boxer who has taught Lou how to throw a punch. Lou is as extroverted and impulsive as Mooney is defensive and introspective. It is in the Moonie-Lou friendship that Moyle's film transcends the traditional female bonding story. Rather that fall into the trap of having the two girls immediately hit it off, Moonie is resistent. But Lou keeps trying and eventually Moonie comes around.

Lou immediately embraces the small town experience and her fresh perspective on the things that Mooney has stopped noticing begins to subtly change Mooney's feeling about her hometown. An especially beautiful scene involves Mooney joining in as her two sisters (if they look like sisters it is because they are played by actresses who are sisters-nice casting) sing a traditional song around a campfire. Mooney's internal conflict (and increasingly difficult decision) between staying or going is what the film is about but Moyle artfully soft-pedals this dynamic by packaging it around a humorous parallel story about Mooney's scheme to escape from New Waterford.

In this small Irish Catholic town the very mention of the blessed Virgin is enough to make potential sinners stop dead in their tracks. Much of the humor comes from Lou's ability to knock out boys with a sucker punch. The local girls enlist her as an agent of the blessed Virgin who can punish their two-timing boyfriends. In ""Times Square"" Moyne used a similar contrivance, having the two girls drop television sets from the Times Square rooftops. While both are mildly ridiculous, beneath the surface of each there is considerable food for thought as metaphors for issues raised by the films; in ""New Waterford Girl"" these include infidelity, sexual awakening, forbidden love, and small-minded parochialism.

But in the final analysis ""New Waterford Girl"" is transcendent because of the pairing of Balaban and Spencer-Nairm. The two actresses not only hold their own with each other, they are perfect complements and Moyle skillfully uses reaction shots that allow them to enhance each other's performances.

WARNING: Although most of the technical production elements (cinematography, production design, editing) are excellent, the audio (at least on the DVD) is second rate (more accurately second to all). Many lines are a challenge to make out and several are simply unintelligible. I suspect that it was a film production problem and not a DVD issue. While this does not ruin the film it definitely weakens it. The audio deficiency is compounded by the puzzling failure to provide a captioning option; someone should roast in hell for that omission. If ever a DVD needed subtitles this is the one. At least Showtime has provided subtitles in the version they are currently running.
The DVD lacks any useful special features; it has one trailer and a short (rather lame) featurette. Since there are no commentaries and the VHS version (also in widescreen) is considerably cheaper, VHS might be the way to go.

The music is fantastic and it is too bad a CD was not released.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1130284800,12,5138,5.135167464114833
1675206,3,B00005Y6Y3,"Quirky provincials Canadian style highlight New Waterford Girl. Apparently the southern United States has been spared the you-alls and we get Cape Breton brogues to make fun of. Liane Balaban, Mooney is smarter than her neighbors and family. She yearns to get out of the desolate coastal mining town she wanders in a daze.

  It is hard to date this pictures' era, but I'm guessing, because all the cars look like rusted late 60's, the boy's hair-do's are over the ears, and because the music played at the local teen beer bash are from 8-tracks, Mooney and her new girlfriend from the States, Tara Spencer-Naim, are living in late 70's, maybe early 80's.

  Quirkiness requires exaggeration. Moony's dad has a funeral and a wedding together to save money. Moony is told by her family to forget her dreams and be like them, accepting of small town life. Tara comes into Mooney's world and they go on a drinking, boy kissing, cad-bashing spree. Are any of the convolutions of this plot realistic? No, but we do sympathize with Moony's desire to get to New York City. This is a sweet movie with some cursing, and teen girls will love it.",1091404800,3,1135,4.678391959798995
1675207,4,B00005Y6Y3,"Mooney Pottie is an eccentric, teenage, odd duck in the small Irish-Catholic town of New Waterford on Cape Breton, Nova Scotia---a town where the mere mention of the Blessed Virgin will stop a sinner ""in his tracks"". Played to perfection by Liane Balaban, Mooney is determined to escape from her small-town life by any means possible (including cleverly trying to get herself a false bad reputation and then planning to tell her parents she is pregnant so they will send her away).
Mooney befriends a new neighbor, Lou (played with brilliant perfection by Tara Spencer-Nairn) after an initial period of wariness at this transplanted New Yorker's enthusiasm for New Waterford.
This comedy reveals its quirky twist in the first scene, a wedding and funeral being held at the same time in the local Catholic church. The pregnant bride shares the altar with her father's casket - showing the inherent thrift of the locals! Of course, sorting out the sympathy and wedding cards becomes a bit of a problem.
The authenticity of the script can be attributed to the fact that it was written by a woman who actually lived in New Waterford in the 70s, the time in which the movie is set.
Despite her desire to get out, we see the beautiful, if rough, vista of Nova Scotia through Mooney's eyes and realize the pull this incredible coastal area has on her.
A delightful film---every actor does a fine job and the coastal settings are spectacular.",1024444800,11,1434,4.809716599190283
1675208,4,B00005Y6Y3,"A thoroughly enjoyable comedy, set in Cape Breton, in which the rebelliously strange Moonie Pottie tries to escape her small town life.  Hampered on all sides by her family, peers, and everyone else in town, Moonie figures the only way out is to pretend to be pregnant-- so she'll be sent away to have the child.
 What follows is an unusual, subtle, and charming story, featuring plenty of great characters: Moonie's best friend Lou from New York, who finds acceptance in New Waterford by punching out the local girls philandering boyfriends; Cecil Sweeney, the local high school teacher, who is completely besotted with Moonie, and lives off the leftover chile she brings him; the priest, who dreads his hours the confessional and dreams of having long hair and a little terrier; the doctor with a perpetually bleeding hand...and so on.  The cast are all great, ranging from unknowns Liane Balaban and Tara Spencer-Nairn, to well known Canadian actors Nicholas Campbell and Mary Walsh (hilarious as Moonie's parents).
 The type of movie you like to see more than once, to get all the little jokes.",1013990400,11,1098,4.951086956521739

7956684,4,B00005Y6Y3,"I love a quirky movie if it's done right, this one is.  It's an indie, so you'll only recognize a few of the actors, but the director covered all the bases  with characters that are only a little strange if you live outside the community.  Growing up around a bunch of eccentrics seems normal if that's all you know.  Worth a rent!",1430956800,,331,4.290322580645161
7956685,5,B00005Y6Y3,"The Canadian-distributed Alliance Atlantis DVD of ""New Waterford Girl"" pictured here (torso shot of pink-sweatered actress Liane Balaban lying on a background of grass) is presented in 1:33 ""full-screen"". Although this DVD's aspect-ratio is not listed or mentioned in its Amazon ad... it is labeled as ""Full-Screen"" on the back of the DVD case. Also... although I am led to understand that this film was actually shot as wide-screen, this full-screen distribution has excellent color and sharpness.

BEWARE, however, that this film is also available as an American-distributed DVD from NY-based Wellspring Media... but as is pointed out by another reviewer, that DVD's presentation is a cropped full-screen image that has been additionally cut off by black bars at the top and bottom, so that it LOOKS LIKE a small widescreen image in the center of your 16:9 TV's frame, but actually shows LESS of the film's image than the Alliance Atlantis DVD. The Wellspring Media DVD's aspect-ratio is not labeled on either the case or the disc.

Even worse... the Wellspring Media DVD has horrible color and is BADLY out-of focus. It is literally unwatchable.

Since none of these DVD's reviews definitively clarified these issues, I purchased both of the DVDS, in order to compare them myself... so I am able to verify that the above descriptions are accurate.",1414108800,,1350,5.127272727272727

This is a very well written, heart warming and funny film that I highly recommend.  If you like this, you will also like Lars and the Real Girl.",1389657600,,376,4.23943661971831
7956687,4,B00005Y6Y3,"Talk about a quirky indy flick. This about takes the cake.

Here's the scoop. Fifteen year old Mooney lives with her family in a bust-out, coastal, Canadian town. She's bright, creative and clearly needs a more nurturing environment. The town is steeped in religion, coal and booze. The only encouragement she gets is from her teacher who has some issues himself. One day a young girl moves in with her mom next door. Turns out she's from Manhattan. A real outsider. Together, the two of them hatch a plan to allow Mooney to take advantage of a scholarship in New York.

This movie could hardly be more fun. Mooney is a real card and she is what's happening here. Liane Balaban has created a truly wonderful character. You feel her frustration as she tries to deal with the geeks she's surrounded with. They think she's a goof ball, and don't get what she's about. Mom finally sees it at the end but her sisters and father don't have a clue. Nicholas Campbell is a veteran actor and does a fine job as her father. Andrew McCarthy is also good as the teacher. Cathy Moriarty does a decent job in a too small role. Everyone else is solid. The story takes some really oddball turns and the characters do a lot to help that along. It's funny seeing them try to reconcile their indiscretions with their religion.

I could complain that essentially all the males are duh heads but the girls aren't really much better. The music is decent but, as best I could tell, this is set in the late 60s or early 70s and they could have flipped for a couple of the songs that were playing at the time to help cement the mood. But that's a minor quibble compared to how good the movie is overall. If you need a rousing bit of fun, you'd be hard pressed to find something better.",1347667200,,1760,4.409230769230769
7956688,2,B00005Y6Y3,"I had seen ""New Waterford Girl"" on cable some time ago and wanted a copy to share with others.  The production values for the copy I recieved were much different than that of the cable version.  The specific issue was the sound quality...background music overrides the dialogue in many critical areas...sounds as if the sound editor thought the movie was only about the music.",1330732800,,376,4.859375

I grew up in the 70s in a small Irish/French Catholic town in the Maritimes, and I found the movie's portrayal of the town and its people pretty accurate.

7956690,5,B00005Y6Y3,"I purchased this movie for a present, but by no fault of Amazon, it didn't arrive in time.  I will never give it away, but I may purchase it for many friends.  This is a FABULOUS film.  I thought it was a boxing movie, but you have to watch it for 45 minutes to even see a shred of boxing.  This is witty, bright, intelligent, and a simply amazing film.  Guys, girls, everyone loves it.  We saw ""Juno"" just before seeing this movie, and they are two films that are worth contrasting.  Gee whiz, ya' just gotta see this movie, see the talented actors/actresses, appreciate the dialogue and plot development...ya' just gotta see it.  It is definitely one of my all-time favorite films, and I'm really, really picky.",1200700800,,713,4.515625
7956691,5,B00005Y6Y3,"To me, this is what family is all about.  Moonie's mother and father struggle to understand her.  She's weird.  She's creative. She's an artist.  Their little town isn't large enough for her.  Moonie's family push her to give up her dreams, like each of them did.  That probably was alright for them.  Moonie persists and finally her mother ""gets it,"" not that she understands Moonie's artistic nature at all, just that she understands that Moonie needs to live in a larger world.  After all is said and done, the most important thing is that Moonie's mother loves her.",1172016000,,569,4.73469387755102
7956692,3,B00005Y6Y3,"Since the mid-'90s, I've been collecting laserdiscs and DVDs.  Never before have I had the following problem with a movie:  it is cropped on the left, right, TOP AND BOTTOM!  As such, ""New Waterford Girl"" is very strange and distracting to watch.  Perhaps one might think that some shots were oddly composed, when this is not true.

It's apparent that the movie's real aspect ratio is 1.85:1.

For this DVD, the 1.85:1 image was first blown up to 1.33:1 (thus cropping the left and right sides).  Then, some black bars were slapped on to the top and bottom of the 1.33:1 image to make it *look* 1.85:1 (now the top and bottom of the screen are missing portions of the original, 1:85:1 image).

Proof: The movie often airs on Showtime.  I compared this DVD to the version I had taped off of Showtime.  In particular, the scene where Mooney's in the bar; just before Lou comes up to her table.  On the VHS tape, one can see Mooney's entire right hand.  On the DVD, half of it is cut off.

I'm glad that this little-known movie is at least available on DVD (better than nothing).  I just wish that it didn't have this significant flaw in presentation.

Fortunately, the rest of the disc is more appealing.  The video quality is much better here than on Showtime.  [Most obviously when Lou's red coat is on-screen. :)]  Also, there's a cool, useful Featurette.

But still, I cannot recommend this DVD.  Not until the aspect ratio problem is fixed.  Until that point, one's better off seeing ""NWG"" on Showtime.",1162512000,7,1505,4.582706766917293
