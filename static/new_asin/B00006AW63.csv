Learned my lesson though----MUST be more careful when choosing to order!!  Always double check the region and format of dvds....otherwise, you just pay for something you can never watch.  Appreciate the sellers follow-thru, but take it from the one who made the mistake:  if a Disney movie is inexpensive, (almost too good to be true), it probably IS too good to be true.
