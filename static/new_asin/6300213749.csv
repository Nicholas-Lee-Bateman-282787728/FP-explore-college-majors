253535,4,6300213749,"When i look back at the films of the 1980's ""48 Hours"" has to
be one of the best and most memorable films of that particular
time periord. What is shown here is a slam bang mix of action
and rasict comedy when Murphy is sprung out of jail on a weekend
pass to help a tough no-nonsense cop(Played by Nick Nolte in his
good attempt at playing these type of roles) in tracking down
Murphey's ex-partner who is ine search of hidden loot from a
previous heist. The chemistry between Murphey & Nolte is realistic and times very funny. This is the film that pretty much
started the whole ""buddy buddy"" craze which was very popular back
in the eighties especally films like THE LETHAL WEAPON films
The standout performaces was when Murphy masquarades as cop
in a local redneck bar. Very funny film and is indeed one of
Eddie Murphy's best.",1004140800,6,831,4.437908496732026
253536,4,6300213749,"Even Now, Decades after it's Theatrical Release, ""48 Hours"" is Almost (see below) as Fresh as Ever. Like ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""48 Hours"" had Many Imitators, but None of them reached the Intensity, the Realism or the Laugh Level of this True Original.
Eddie Murphy plays it Quite Dramatically (but, of course, he's Still Hilarious) as Reggie Hammond, a Convict with a 2-day Leave pass thanks to Detective Jack Cates (Nick Nolte, playing the role that led him to Gravel-voiced Greatness), who needs Reggie to help him track down two Chain-gang Escapees who used to be part of Reggie's Crew. It's a Simple story, and a Tired Formula. Two Men, one White, one Black, from Opposite sides of the law, forced by Circumstance to Team Up. From ""Bullet proof"" to ""Fled"", from ""Hard Rain"" to ""The Negotiator"", many films have been down this road, but Rarely have they done it so Originally, so Comically, so Violently or so Realistically. ""48 Hours"" doesn't Shy Away from the Race issue either, which is a Brave thing. In the End though, I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 as it does have a few Slow points and it is Starting to look a little Dated the more I watch it. Nolte's Outfits look like the stuff Bogart used to wear.
Walter Hill's Directing style was still in the Growing phase, but it is that Unassured-ness that brought out the Best in him, he has since Lost the Originality on display here. Eddie Murphy's debut was a Street-smart one, he looks the part, he walks the walk, talks the talk and he proves himself a Natural-Born Talent. It is His film and Nolte seems Quite Happy to be the Co-star. Like I said above, ""48 Hours"" is Starting to look a little Dated with Every Passing year, but it's Surprising that it's held up This long. It Still holds the title of ""Best Buddy Movie"" in many people's eyes, it may not in Mine, but it Is up there.",992217600,,1836,4.467261904761905
253537,4,6300213749,This was a funny movie and an action movie at the same time. I have this one taed it is great. Eddie murphy brings out his best ever. I also recommend the hit sequel titled Another 48 hours.,988502400,,190,4.026315789473684
253538,4,6300213749,"You may not have known much about Eddie Murphy in 1982. He just started Saturday Night Live and hadn't released any comedy videos yet, but this movie launched his stellar career. Nick Nolte who was known but not for  leading cop roles plays a tough hard straight detective who meets up with  convict Eddie Murphy and his irreverant attitude. Nolte wants to find  (Gans) chain gang fugitive, cop killer and seeks help from convict Murphy.  Murphy only agrees to help if he can work with Nolte on the outside.  They're given 48 hrs. Innovative plot which leads to a bunch of one liners,  put downs and funny suprises. The chemistry works well. Walter Hill  director (The Warriors) brings in some real good character actors as  villans. Violent scenes are realistic and memorable funny moments. The use  of everyday by the book cops, hotel clerk bimbos and bar rednecks are great  dressing for the humor, gun fights and serious action scenes. If you like  mystery thrillers this has all the suspense plus comedy. It's a must see!",957744000,,1026,4.7727272727272725
253539,4,6300213749,i enjoyed eddie going into the bar and what have you.he was the film period.the film was very un-pc in it's use of stereotypes and what not. Nick Nolte was a bigot mad at world Archie Bunker type Cop.two worlds seemingly  different but by films end very much alike.the only down side aside from  the racial slurs which were loaded enough was that Eddie's character had no  background once upon release.but a good film.,947894400,,418,4.621621621621622

253587,4,6300213749,Classic action comedy that is a nice reminder of how brilliant Eddie Murphy was in his early days and what an incredibly gifted actor Nick Nolte is when given good material.

It's a fun cop flick carried by two stars that were at the top of their game during this era.,1501545600,,374,4.434782608695652

253620,3,6300213749,Its an action packed movie but just about ok. 1982 movie had a lot of dialogues which today may not sound right and will get called racist. Not a bad one time see but its ok if someone has not seen it.,1500768000,,201,3.8095238095238093

253622,5,6300213749,"This is a classic 80s movie for sure.  Those familiar with director Walter Hill will recognize his gritty style in this film.  The streets of San Francisco seem mean, dirty and real.  There is great action here that doesn't seem too ridiculous or over the top.  No absurd CGI stunts just good old fashioned car chases, shoot outs, and fist fights.
You might not get Oscar worthy performances from heroes Nolte and Murphy, and Villains Remar and Kelly (also seen in Walter Hill's The Warriors) but they are convincing in the roles written for them.
Personally I'll never really get sick of watching this at least once a year.",1497830400,2,624,4.697247706422019

What I'd forgotten was lotsa (way too much) violence, Nick Nolte sweating, sick and looking not pretty and sounding worse (happy to say he seems YOUNGER in 'the long walk' or whatever that movie is with him and Robert Redford, which DID crack me up.)
After my husband and I watched it (we may have dozed off at times) I commented that I must have confused it with the level of movie that was Beverly Hills Cops (which i LOVE) - this just didn't work.  starting out with lotsa cops getting shot and a poor beleaguered overweight, alcoholic, chain-smoking white cop trying to capture a  (?) a horrible cop-shooting bad-guy without any help than a recently released criminal just didn't hold it as a premise/story-line.  where were all the other cops of the city, all dead?  anyhoo....I think it just wasn't funny, so i didn't like it.",1474848000,,923,4.569696969696969

villain. This is back when Eddie Murphy was a comic genius at the height of his career. Now its no secret that Murphy`s performance in this movie shot him into superstar status but something that isn't as talked about is Nolte`s great performance. Their chemistry is perfection.

254294,3,6300213749,"My seeing this movie on Amazon Prime is my very first viewing of it. I never saw it in theaters or on traditional TV. I wonder if I would have liked it more if I'd seen it when it had first hit the theaters. There's no denying this project was well shot, edited and soundtracked. There's no denying the charisma and chemistry of Nolte and Murphy, the stars, and that there were some clever bits and lines peppered throughout the story.

However, the overall effort is marred by the thin plot and moments of such stupidity as to be jaw-dropping, rather than laugh inducing, especially concerning firearms and Nick Nolte's character, Jack Cates. What police officer of any training--even if buzzed on whiskey--complies with the order of a prime suspect in the murder of other law enforcement personnel to cede possession of his service weapon on the expectation of mercy? What police brass would not immediately remove this man from the force for negligent homicide of a fellow officer?--Let alone give him another gun and put him back on the streets?? Cates is one of the most inept hero characters I've seen on a screen. The crooks aren't that much smarter, though, since Cates manages to get them in the end with the help of his antagonistic convict partner, Reggie Hammond (Murphy), who's stupid enough to trust Cates with his loot.

As Cates and Hammond go from one made-for-'70s-TV scenario to another in pursuit of their quarry, there comes a point when Cates doubles down on his stupidity by leaving his gun on the hood of his car, while he busies himself with a gratuitous fistfight against Hammond. It's the heroes' dumb luck that the consequences for their stupidity aren't more severe. Everything is too pat while not making sense, like the crooks being able to obtain a Muni bus without any difficulty or a car loaded with loot that has been parked in the same garage for three years. Having lived most of my life in SF, I know the City government can be less than helpful at times, but the City would to be post-apocalyptic if it were entirely staffed by people who'd let Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond run amok through it for even a day, let alone two. Maybe it'd have worked better if the mayhem was even more over the top, like in a John Woo or Tarantino movie. Nor was there anything suspenseful or surprising (aside from Cates' being the dumbest character in the picture), nor were the protagonists appealing outside of the charismatic personae of the stars playing them.

I guess ""48 Hrs."" is OK, but it's not something I'd go out of my way to see again.",1449964800,,2571,4.6461538461538465

between a red neck detective and a hip street convict. Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are magnetic as two antagonists who eventually share a mutual respect for each other. James Remar totally sells himself as a merciless brutal cold blooded killer",1448064000,,413,5.17910447761194

No real plot, just a lot of stuff (mostly random and violent) happening in some sort of sequence.  Hollywood's idea of what goes on in a police station.  Hollywood's idea of what goes on everywhere else.

And this kind of lighting quick, razor sharp banter is what makes this movie an amazingly surprising gem. The last 2 people you'd expect to have great chemistry is Murphy and Nolte.  And to an extent... They don't. And that perfect because they are supposed to hate each other in the movie so they play off of each other perfectly.

The script is a steaming pile of crap. The movie was produced with excellent actors, on top of their game, and with excellent cinematography and editing. I give it three stars mainly because of Eddie Murphy's stellar performance. The movie was totally unwatchable before he came onto the scene. I only hung in there long enough to see him because I had hope, and he delivered. He couldn't save this story for me in the end. It was just too unbearably contrived.

As the film was made in 1982 the cars, fashion and hairstyles capture the era well, and the narrative achieves all it can with a fairly predictable plot and two colourful personalities leading the way.

Nicholas R.W. Henning  Australian Author",1433635200,,334,4.842105263157895
255502,4,6300213749,"From 1982, ""48 Hrs."" remains one of the better action-comedy buddy pictures you'll find.  Eddie Murphy is a hyperkinetic standout in his first major motion picture, and Nick Nolte matches him shot for shot in his more casual, laid-back manner.  They make a good team, so good, in fact, that they returned a few years later for a sequel, ""Another 48 Hrs.""  But we've got the first one here on Blu-ray disc, and it's nice to have it in high definition.

One interesting thing to notice is that Nick Nolte got top billing for the movie; indeed, Eddie Murphy doesn't even enter the picture until well into the plot.  Eight years later when the two actors made the sequel, it was Murphy who would get top billing.  Times and careers change.

The movie starts right off with a fairly exciting prison escape, followed only a few minutes later by an equally intense gunfight.  So far, there's not a lot of humor showing, not, that is, until Murphy shows up.

Nolte plays Jack Cates, a high-strung, world-weary San Francisco police detective.  The first time we meet him he's fighting with his girlfriend, Elaine (Annette O'Toole in much too small a role).  Then we follow him to the aforementioned shoot-out, where an escaped convict, Albert Ganz (James Remar, always a good villain), is blasting away a pair of Jack's policeman friends.  Jack is the typically hard-nosed, tough-guy cop we see only in the movies, who, like Dirty Harry before him, likes to work alone and hates following orders.  When the homicidal maniac Ganz guns down Jack's friends, Jack vows to bring Ganz in, despite his commanding officer, Capt. Haden (Frank McRae as a predictably bellowing police captain), ordering him not to seek revenge.

Here's where Murphy finally comes in (coming in later than you might have remembered).  He plays a San Quentin convict, Reggie Hammond, a thief who once worked with Ganz.  Jack's idea is to free Reggie for forty-eight hours in order for Reggie to help him catch Ganz.  Reggie realizes that with Ganz on the loose, the idiot might just come after him, giving Reggie reason to help Jack bring him in.  (Although, to be fair, Reggie seems more interested in his few hours release to pursue sex rather than pursue Ganz.)

So, we've got a grumpy, white, maybe racist cop paired with a wisecracking, black, maybe racist con, and, naturally, the results are going to be explosive.  If these two don't kill each other in the process, they might just get their man.

Here's something I hadn't noticed before:  The relationship between Jack and Reggie is strongly reminiscent of that between Shrek and Donkey a couple of decades later.  The exchanges between the two men have to have influenced the later ""Shrek"" writers, they are so very obvious and the humor so much the same.

Anyway, Nolte and Murphy play characters they would repeat many times over in their careers.  Nolte is the cranky, hard-assed loner; Murphy is the cool, happy-go-lucky jive talker.  The differences in their styles make for splendid fireworks and reward the viewer in almost every scene.  Co-writer and director Walter Hill (""The Warriors,"" ""The Long Riders,"" ""Red Heat,"" ""Last Man Standing"") keeps the pace moving at a healthy clip while avoiding the usual San Francisco postcard shots, instead confining the action mainly to darker, seedier locales.  So, while the friction between Nolte's and Murphy's characters continues, we get a hard-edged look with the film as well.  The noir appearance adds to the frisson and excitement, while Murphy's continuous and seemingly improvisational quips and behavior lighten the mood of what might otherwise have been just another crime film.

""48 Hours"" is not as funny as Murphy's later ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies, which are clearly derivative of the earlier film, nor is ""48 Hours"" as funny as most of us who haven't seen it for many years remember it.  Still, it's a good, taut, surprisingly brief action comedy, with the primary emphasis on the action.  Would it have succeeded as well as it does without Nolte and Murphy in the lead roles?  I doubt it.

Video:
The 1.85:1 transfer comes to us via a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4 AVC codec.  The first thing we notice is the grain in the picture, largely because the filmmakers open with outdoor location shots; later in the film we notice similar grain in additional locations shooting, but it's not at all objectionable and gives the image body and texture.  Besides, there are many other location shots that show only the thinnest veneer of grain, and indoor shots show little grain at all.  I'd say if you're dead set against grain, even that grain which is naturally inherent to the print--the way it showed up originally in a theater--you may object to some of it here; but if you give the film a chance, you won't even know it's there.

Beyond the minor grain issue, you'll find decent color; at least stable black levels; and realistic facial tones.  While definition varies from scene to scene, sometimes soft, sometimes sharp, it is acceptable and should not disappoint viewers.

Audio:
Paramount audio engineers provide a lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack, which does its job commendably well, even if the sound doesn't offer the kind of blockbuster experience many of today's movies do.  There is, for instance, an admirably clear midrange, a wide front-channel stereo spread, an ample dynamic range, a solid impact, and a pleasing mid-bass warmth.  There is not much surround activity, though, the rear speakers confined to a few car noises, bullet ricochets, and whatever else one's audio receiver can muster up.

Extras:
If it's extras you're looking for, you won't find them here.  I suppose Paramount had little or nothing to offer in this department, or they would have included more than just a widescreen theatrical trailer.  Well, at least it's in high definition.  Beyond the trailer, we get fifteen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
If ""48 Hrs."" seems to have lost a little of its edge over the years, it's probably because we've seen so many other movies imitate it since.  Remember, movies like the ""Lethal Weapon"" series and even ""Another 48 Hrs."" came later.  ""48 Hrs."" was a one-of-a-kind film for its day, and even without quite the impact it used to have, it's still entertaining.",1432771200,4,6447,4.9415041782729805

255505,4,6300213749,"48 HRS. (1982) is a crime thriller starring Nick Nolte as a tough guy/alcoholic cop in San Francisco who survives a fracas where two officers are killed. To apprehend the culprits (James Remar & Sonny Landham) he enlists the services of a convict (Eddie Murphy) for 48 hours. Annette O'Toole plays the cops barely-seen babe and is therefore neglected.

The film was directed by Walter Hill, the director and co-writer of 1979s The Warriors, and so it has some of the flair of that movie, as well as two of its main actors (Remar and David Patrick Kelly). Its easy to confuse it with Beverly Hills Cop, which came out two years later, since they're both cop thrillers starring Eddie Murphy, but Beverly Hills Cop is the superior film IMHO. Of course, it depends on what you're in the mood for. 48 HRS is more serious, brutal and edgy while BHC is lighter and more likable. The latter could be described as part comedy (although mostly serious) whereas the former is rough and nigh profane with amusing touches. BHC is just more palatable and has better themes in my opinion. The streetwise edginess of 48 HRS is too over-the-top comic booky and its a turn-off. Nonetheless, its a quality cop thriller and the character ark of the main characters is good, albeit predictable.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in San Francisco and Los Angeles, California.

It didn't wink at the audience with every joke or gunshot like current buddy cop action comedies such as, ""The Heat"", ""Ride Along"", ""Let's Be Cops"", etc. Don't get me wrong, I like those too, but ""48 HRS."" is the model for this genre and a movie I simply love.

this is about the DVD and Blu-ray release of this classic film

Eddie murphy's first film and he's a Natural in the film
Great comedy performance and same with Nick Nolte Great performance aswell
Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are a perfect team in this film
Brilliantly Directed by Walter Hill from the first scene to the last scene
i have the 2006 DVD reissue of the film
so the DVD release on the amazon listing is wrong
the cover shown is correct but the release date is wrong
the picture and audio quality on the 2006 reissue is excellent
bright coloured Widescreen the Audio is Digitally remastered in 5.1 surround sound aswell
better than VHS quality for sure

but very Dissapointing there's no special features at all
No new interviews with Walter Hill or Nick nolte or Eddie murphy about the making of the film
not even an Audio commentary by Walter Hill
there is only a Theatrical trailer
but at least the picture quality looks excellent, brilliant Widescreen transfer
very Disgusting that there's no extras except for the Trailer
a classic film like this deserves a special edition for sure
this film deserves a Interview with Walter Hill, Eddie Murphy or Nick nolte at least
but Dissapointing for some reason Paramount pictures have not released a special edition of this film.

but Paramount have released this film on Blu-ray, which i think is a waste of money
cause the blu-ray reissue is the same as the DVD release
absolutely no new interviews at all except for Theatrical trailer
maybe the films presentation has been given a blu-ray upgrade to HD quality.
i havn't seen the blu-ray version cause there's no extras at all
so i didn't bother wasting my money buying it, i already have the DVD release.

Hopefully one day Paramount pictures will get a wake up call and finally realize
that this classic film deserves a special edition Blu-ray release
with all new interviews with Walter Hill, Eddie murphy and Nick Nolte
but who knows so don't Hold your breath waiting.
if you think the blu-ray is worth buying
 just to check out the film's presentation if it's HD or not then fine burn some cash.

i'm staying with my DVD release
i gave this review 4 stars cause i love the film and the DVD 2006 reissue
picture and audio quality is Good enough for me in terms of Quality
if the new blu-ray release had all new extras like new interviews
then i would give it a 5 star rating but sadly it's barebones release.",1383177600,4,2467,4.6082004555808656

255738,3,6300213749,"The bargain-rack movie for last night was ""48 Hours"" starring Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Alas, it was not one of my better picks. Nolte played one of those ""tough guy"" cops, you know, one of those guys who doesn't look like a cop, has a really foul mouth, doesn't follow any of the rules and proceedures and doesn't seem to answer to anyone. I guess he was supposed to be some type of Dirty Harry, but he's nowhere nearly as good. Anyway, Nolte had need to find some really bad dude and the only way was to enlist a former bad-dude associate (Murphy), now serving a prison sentence. Nolte got Murphy released for 48 hours in order to carry out their search, and the two formed an uneasy alliance (one a cop, one a convict) in order to accomplish the task. It's mildly amusing, especially the part played by Murphy, as you might expect. In general, it's poor acting, a weak script, outrageously poor driving (but a bit funny) and lots of action. Yaawwwnnnn!

""48 Hours"" was fairly well produced and moved along at a brisk pace through a range of interesting San Francisco environments. Some of the underground music was quite enjoyable. Nothing about the story seemed believable, but I'd guess it was meant to be more of a comedy than a meaningful story, so it's off the hook on that one. But, if it was a comedy, it wasn't a very good one. It's just ho-hum, a two hour filler for someone that has nothing better to do. No doubt, someone will think it's the best movie he or she has ever seen.

255740,5,6300213749,"It takes two to tango, and 48 Hours features the superb pairing of Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy.  Both actors are arguably at their peak - Murphy making his debut before his silly laugh became his trademark, and Nolte careening at his dishevelled best.

The pair's gritty conviction and humour absolutely drive the film. The word ""politically incorrect"" has been used to describe the film's characterizations, but the chemistry of Nolte and Murphy transcends everything. Everything.

Armed with Walter Hill's masterful action packed direction, a great script, and real bad guys (James Remar menacing as the cop killer), they just don't make films like that anymore.  Walter Hill brings the Wild Wild West to San Francisco, and his gunfighter instincts serve him well.  There are no wasted moments in this show, and no dialogue that shouldn't be in there.

48 Hours is the real deal - a classic with few, if any peers in the buddy cop genre.",1333411200,,939,4.9113924050632916
255741,5,6300213749,"This is a great film. It's unique. It's no comedy but quite humorous. I would also hesitate to list it as an adventure film. It's a thriller but too much of the danger in the film is a reflection of the world around us. It can be a dark film at times. Did the cop make a mistake in the hotel lobby which cost another cop his life? The killer is certainly counting on it later in the film when they meet once more in an alley of Chinatown. After the shootout at the hotel Nolte discovers that the escapees were members of a gang who pulled off a big robbery and finds another member of the gang in jail. In this case he makes a deal with him who for for different reasons is also interested in the re-capture of Ganz and Billy Bear. The con is tempoarily released and they form a partnership for 48 hours. The two guys struggle to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. They depend upon one another more than they admit or care. At the start they may not be partners, brothers or friends but at the end they are effectively working like a team albeit a temporary one. Hollywood tried but could never recapture the success of 48 Hours but part of the problem was the film's use of anti-heros. Nick Nolte is no Dick Tracy. He's gone somewhat beserk but is resolute to bring both men to justice for the murders while Murphy realizes that he will lose everything if Nolte doesn't succeed. There was also very good support from the cast especially James Remar as Ganz the lunatic killer. The entire film was well written and put together.

255742,5,6300213749,"They don't make movies like this anymore.  1982 was a very good time for cinema.  The realism of early 70s cinema still lurked as the backbone for a lot of commercial cinema, and with dazzling results.  The film was shot on real film and it has that look.  In terms of acting, Murphy and Nolte just shine.  The bad guys are real baddies, and they put in very convincing performances - nice and creepy.  Another film with baddies like this: Eastwood's ""Sudden Impact"", made right around the same time, '82 or '83.

I saw 48 Hours a second time with friends recently.  There's a lot of back story to the plot which takes a good 40 minutes to establish before Murphy even makes his appearance.  But when he does, wow, the picture really begins.  I've kind of lost my taste for Murphy in recent years but this film clearly reiterates for me how and why Murphy suddenly exploded onto the film scene after having been only of Saturday Night Live fame prior to it.  A masterpiece in un-PC that fans of crime cinema and comedy will love assuming they're not attention deficit and can hang with the brutal first half hour of the movie which is in no way comic.

The DVD I bought looked great in widescreen but there were no subtitles as advertised on this link.  My English is fine but the friends I watched it with aren't native speakers and need subtitles, so I was disappointed by the fact that there were none.  There appear to be two versions in DVD - the one where Murphy has a cigar in his mouth, and the one where he doesn't.  I bought the one where he doesn't.

Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are superb as the cop/convict duo on the heels of an escapee and his accomplices trying to track down a $500,000 prize (dirty money).  I believe this is Eddie Murphy's first film.  Obviously it wasn't his last.  There's plenty of action, rye humor, and a great cat and mouse chase through the streets of San Francisco.  It's a classic crime drama that hasn't gone stale.  The verbal exchanges between Nolte and Murphy are profane, but unlike many films of today, it was necessary in this script between a dirty cop and a dirty convict.

It combines fantastic performances by Nolte and Murphy together with lots of excellent action, a solid and engaging storyline, and some incredible humor.  This film made Eddie Murphy a box office sensation and also propelled Nolte's career into the big time.

The storyline is simple.  Nick Nolte is a tough San Francisco detective known to be a little too quick on the trigger.  When one of his fellow cops gets shot by a convict on the run, Nolte goes after him.  He quickly discovers that one of the convict's ex-partners, (Murphy) is incarcerated, and he gets him sprung to help track down the convict.  At first there is hostility, but gradually the two manage a tenuous bond of mutual respect.  Lots of first-rate action punctuate the story.  As if that were not enough, this film features a scene by Murphy (the ""cowboy bar scene"") that is one of the funniest scenes in any flick ever.  (This one scene both makes the movie and made Murphy a first-rank star.)

There is not a dull moment in this film.  From the very first scenes it grabs the viewer's attention and never lets go. The supporting cast is just about as good as Nolte and Murphy.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1261440000,2,1230,4.6342592592592595
255750,4,6300213749,"It is a testament to Murphy's comic talent and Nolte's acting that they can take such an utterly banal cop story and make it so entertaining, even original at times.  OK, it doesn't keep its freshness the way Murphy's other great films do (i.e. BHC and TP), but it is still fun after all these years.  Some scenes, like the entry to the redneck bar, are truly classic.  Plus, Murphy still had genuine energy - a blooming talent - with this film, unlike the walkthrough-style roles he got in many many later forgettable mediocre comedies.

The plot couldn't be more standard:  cop killer takes a maverick cop's gun and the chase is on (for honor justice revenge).  But then he gets Murphy out of jail to find a common enemy, and after wonderful sparring and anger-letting, they come to trust and like eachother.  It is very American, with perceptive issues such as Nolte's apology for ""doin my job keepin you down"", and the stars are totally convincing in their chemistry.

255752,3,6300213749,"Whether this is the original buddy cop movie which launched a whole genre or not it's  certainly one of the best. Ganz (James Remar), an escaped convict, goes on a violent search for money that him and a couple of partners stole and hid three years ago. Only a few people know where the money is hidden and one of them is Luther (David Patrick Kelly). Ganz meets up with him and Luther tells him that he can't access the money for a couple of days so Ganz takes his girl as collateral. He plans on hiding out at a hotel but the cops trace a stolen credit card that Ganz used to pay for the room and show up at the hotel. A gunfight erupts and of the three cops on the scene the only man to survive is Jack Cates (Nick Nolte). Cates wants Ganz even more now that he is a cop killer and he starts his own investigation  hoping to anticipate Ganz's next move. He learns of the hidden cash and realizes  what Ganz is after. The only other person left alive who was in on the job is a fast talker named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy). He's  in prison serving out his last couple of months on a three year sentence. Thinking that he can lead him to the money before Ganz gets it Cates springs Reggie from jail on a 48 hour pass. Cates is all business but Reggie wants to enjoy being a free man and get a little action. The two hate each other immediately and they spar both verbally and physically. They make a great team and are a lot of fun to watch. There is a lot of humor in watching Nolte as the raspy voiced and hung over cop trying to control a live wire like Murphy (making his film debut). Director Walter Hill would practically remake this movie in the 80's as Red Heat but this is the version that works. The film is raw and gritty with plenty of violence, nudity, and language. There are even a few nasty racial slurs between the two men. Remar is terrifying as Ganz and it is nice to see him and ""Warriors"" co star Patrick Kelly in a complete role reversal from their characters in that Hill classic. This is one of Hill's best films as it shows his considerable gifts at directing exciting action scenes and coming up with great one liners for our heroes to deliver between gunfights and explosions.",1234483200,,2207,4.222748815165877

It is a true classic, highlighting the true natural talent of Eddie Murphy.  He and Nick Nolte play off each other well, and Nolte isn't too bad himself in the comedy department.  Though his type of humor is much more subtle.  He does get his digs in, on Mr. Murphy's expense, mind you.

To the best of my knowledge, this was one of the first movies that combined excellent humor scenes with extreme violence and emotion.  And while many tried to duplicate it, in later years, including other Eddie Murphy vehicles, such as Beverly Hills Cop, nothing can compare to the original!

The action is fast and furious and Murphy in his first big screen breakout overcomes his foul mouth with a good turn, especially in the critically lauded scene at the redneck bar.  Sonny Landham and David Patrick Kelly are suitable villains but lovely Annette O'Toole is wasted in the role of Nolte's sometime lover.

This film was the proving ground for Murphy but he would not become a star until he visited Beverly Hills.  Murphy and Nolte had a good chemistry but after seeing the sequel, it was probably more great writing and directing then the two of them.

Running Time:  96 minutes

Rated R for violence and language.

Walter Hill is one of those directors who seems never to make an average film, mainly because his movies are, generally-speaking, either very good or very bad. ""48 Hours"" is one of his ""very good"" offerings, giving Eddie Murphy one of cinema's most unforgettable movie debuts and invents the conventions of the buddy cop genre that were to become blueprints for years to come.  The film opens with psychopathic Albert Ganz (James Remar) escaping from a chain gang. Determined to track down Ganz, tough cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) springs a fast-talking convict named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from jail for forty-eight hours, during which time the mismatched duo must find their quarry. Cates doesn't like blacks, and Hammond doesn't like cops, so before they can even get to the business of tracking down their man they first have to come to terms with working alongside each other.

Fast-paced, energetic, foul-mouthed and funny, 48 Hours is simply a great ride. Nolte underplays brilliantly, wisely allowing Murphy to handle the loud and showy role while he etches a gruff, rugged characterisation as a cop on the warpath. The leading characters are rounded off wonderfully by James Remar, as a genuinely bad villain. If the plot to ""48 Hours"" sounds like a collection of all the clichs and predictabilities that ruin most films, it's important to remember that before this film nothing like it had really been done. These plot devices and conventions are only considered ""cliches"" nowadays because ""48 Hours"" was so influential, not to mention frequently-imitated, in the ensuing years. James Horner's music score is perfectly judged too. There are numerous exciting and hilarious moments, but none rival the bit where Murphy causes a stir in a redneck bar. More often than not famous movie scenes fail to live up to their lofty reputation, but in this case that simply isn't so. It really is an electrifying screen moment in a film that really is an electrifying screen experience.

48 hrs is trully hilarious, a must see with plenty of action and nonstop laughs.

Jack (Nick Nolte) is the bad cop. He's not a bad cop in the sense that he's a vilain but he's big, rough and mean. So when he has to team up with a con, Reggie (Eddie Murphy) to nail two murderers, things go wild.

From then on, everything is hilarious! Eddie Murphy delivers the majority of them. Look for the hick scene that will deliver laugh after laugh.

James Remar and Sonny Landham are great vilains and add to the fun. So, if you want to have some great fun, watch the classic buddy cop movie!

NOTE THAT WARNER STUDIO IS RELEASING ONE OF THE BEST 2-DISC SPECIAL EDITION SUCH AS 'SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION', 'HEAT', 'MALCOLM X', 'DOG DAY AFTERNOON', 'ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN' AND MANY MANY MORE.

The reason why they don't release every DVD in widescreen enhanced for 16x9 is beyond me since soon Widescreen Tvs will replace standard ones.

IT IS A RELIEF THAT AMAZON IS NOW STATING WHETHER THE DVD IS ANAMORPHIC OR LETTERBOXED.",1130457600,5,2588,4.70945945945946
255818,4,6300213749,"While I don't agree that this movie still holds up after 20 something years, it is still a classic example of a pairing of unlikely allies, in this case an ex-con and a cop on the edge. Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte give dynamite performances. And while the movie has an unexpectedly high level of violence, the comedy shines through. Eddie Murphy's brilliant scene in a redneck bar is unforgetable.",1122595200,10,397,4.685714285714286
255819,5,6300213749,"Yes, this action film is the true origin of the hilarious matching of cranky Shrek and the obnoxious, adorable, devoted donkey.

What begins as a formulaic (if not downright awful) cops-and-robbers flick becomes a classic right from the moment (fully 25 minutes into the story) hardboiled cop Jack Cates follows the off-key singing of convict Reggie through the cell blocks of San Quentin.  (A beloved, oft-quoted cliche).

It's perennial great fun to watch the chemistry between the jaded cop (Nick Nolte) and the streetwise first-offender (Eddie Murphy), as they pair up in San Francisco to catch an escaped killer.  One of the best buddy films!

The film cinched SNL star Murphy's film career, and even Nolte went against his own no-sequels policy to do it again in Another 48 Hrs.",1119312000,,784,5.0
255820,5,6300213749,"Dear weelchair Assassin: There IS a sequel to this, called ""Another 48 Hrs."", & it's EQUALLY GREAT!!!",1117843200,,101,5.0
255821,1,6300213749,"I wasn't expecting a sophisticated film by the Cohen brothers or food-for-though from Jarmusch or other heavy weight director. I supposed it was going to be fun, but the film didn't do the trick: slow, violent, sexist and racist. And not even funny. ""Showtime"" and ""Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man"" are masterpieces compared to it. ""48 hours"" made me realize that if the last white guy available on Earth were somebody resembling Nick Nolte, I will surely pick a better human being from any minority. His character shows the poster boy of a sample of the worst pieces of ""white trash"" on film. A real LOSER ""strutting his part upon the stage"" before reality puts him in halt.",1116201600,4,680,4.722689075630252
255822,5,6300213749,"Ah, 48 Hrs.  Simply put, one of the greatest movies ever made.  I've probably seen this movie about 10 times in the past decade, and it never grows tiresome.  While it's loosely classifiable as a ""buddy movie,"" this is no stupid Chris Farley-David Spade-type vehicle.  With career-defining performances from both Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, this is one of the few movies that have managed to successfully bring together the action and comedy genres.  The dialogue is smart, the action is frequent, and the plot moves at a breakneck pace.  In other words, it's American filmmaking at its finest.  What more could you want?

Even more than most cop movies, 48 Hrs. succeeds at capturing the tense, harrowing atmosphere that comes with urban street life.  Even on the nice new widescreen DVD I just got, there's a rather dark and gloomy feel to this movie that's only somewhat offset by Murphy's considerable comedic abilities.  The movie starts with a bunch of officers of the law being murdered, and it doesn't get much nicer from there.  48 Hrs. revels in the seemier side of the city, a world populated by hookers, drug dealers, and assorted other lowlifes.  Foreshadowing the emergence of brutally realistic cop dramas like The Shield, even the cops are somewhat unsavory figures.

48 Hrs. is a quintessential guy movie, combining tons of azz-kicking action with the kind of gritty realism at which director Walter Hill excels.  Hill doesn't pull too many punches here, as there are people being cut down by gunfire every few minutes, explicit sexual references, some gratuitous nudity, and frequent profanity highlighted by numerous uses of the ""N word.""  In one especially hilarious scene, a police captain directs the latter epithet at Murphy's character, which wouldn't be all that notable if the captain weren't black himself. In general, 48 Hrs. provides the kind of politically incorrect look at race relations that's increasingly hard to find these days, as Nolte's gruff cop Jack and Murphy's slick convict Reggie become symbolic (at least initially) of the often dim views of each other that blacks and whites hold.  There are stereotypes both black and white to be found here, but hey, it's the '80's.

When it's not busy examining the state of race relations in America circa 1982, 48 Hrs. offers the kind of memorable scenes that are all too rare in the often by-the-numbers cop-movie genre.  Reggie's handling of a redneck bar replete with Confederate flags and a topless dancer in a cowboy hat is justifiably legendary, and there's also a bruising back-alley brawl between Jack and Reggie, a gunfight staged between a moving car and a city bus, and the tense concluding standoff in yet another abandoned alley.  There's no frenetic cutting or abundance of CGI effects to be found, but in their place is something more valuable: good direction.

In the end, you'd be hard-pressed to think of a cop movie made since this one that compares to it (well, except for L.A. Confidential, but that's a given).  Hill, Murphy, and Nolte were all obviously at their peaks here, and the result is a movie that succeeds at everything it tries.  I heard there was also a sequel to this movie made, called 48 More Hrs. or something like that, although I've also heard from some corners that no such thing ever happened.  At any rate, this movie is the goods.  If you've never seen it, you can officially consider yourself sad.",1102636800,5,3428,4.901213171577123
255823,5,6300213749,"This film is one of Eddie's funniest movies, Nolte was good also, they both carried the film all the way, what really took the cake was the alley fight scene, and another memorable scene was red neck bar scene. I'd say this is Eddie's second best, the first being Beverly Hills Cop.",1098316800,3,282,4.4423076923076925

255825,5,6300213749,"Some of the best 1-liners ever reside in this film.  Simply put, its a great comedy with a flare for drama, and in the cop buddy genre.  Lots of cursing, some nudity, but ultimately, a great flick.  It kicks today's cop buddy flicks in the Mother F-ing Aholes Mother F-ers!",1085875200,4,273,4.42

255838,4,6300213749,"Eddie Murphy followed others from SNL as me emerged from Mr Rogers sketches and began his movie career.  It was 1982 and people wanted to laugh as the US economy was struggling back from its worst period since the great depression.  Eddie Murphy teamed with Nick Nolte, who got his fame as the bad boy brother from ""Rich Man Poor man"" and EM and NN were tremendous together.  This movie created a lot of ""buzz"" where I worked and of course we got a 48 Hours II.  Nick was the big star payroll wise, but in his first movie, EM shows the promise, which I believe he has fulfilled in becoming one of our greatest movie actors.  For sheer talent is there anyone better than Eddie Murphy?
I give this only 4 stars because of the language and violence which makes it not family friendly.  So put the little ones to bed, sit back and enjoy.",1056585600,2,833,4.3076923076923075
255839,5,6300213749,"In order to appreciate this film fully, you hafta turn yourself back in time to 1982, an' try an' remember the political an' social mindset of the day. Then imagine watching '48 HRS.' an unabashed an' raucous cop thriller that breaks the very foundation of political correctness. Now how does that make you feel? If you say, sick to your stomach, then maybe you needa loosen your jock strap an' try it again.  E'ybody knows the plot, the hard-drinkin', chain-smokin' San Francisco cop Jack Cates, played by Nick Nolte (who looks almost TOO comfortable in the role of a wasted, burn-out), is lookin' to put two recent prison escapees an' vicious cop killers away after he tried an' failed to apprehend them. In going over the case he comes across several members of their old gang an' decides to go talk to one'a the incarcerated ones. Here's where Eddie Murphy comes in. Reggie Hammond is the smooth an' dapper, fast-talking convict who convinces Cates to get him out of jail an' on the street to help him solve this case. Cates reluctantly does so, an' from there is' jus' the two of them together goin' from place to place, crook to crook, bar to bar, lead to lead, tryin' to keep from killing each other in the process. Cates is a rough-edged, semi-bigot with an apparent vendetta toward these crooks (though apparently jus' for stealing his gun), Reggie is the charming, jive-talking criminal, with a more obvious vendetta toward the crooks (they dropped the dime on him, got him locked up, an' are now tryin' to steal a half a million dollars of his hard-earned, er, um, hard-stolen cash). Both are on the same mission, but with two TOTALLY different personalities an' when they mix it up, oh, is' gunpowder. E'ybody talks about the scene with Murphy in the country-western bar playin' cop (""Alright listen up. I don't like white people. An' I HATE rednecks. You people're rednecks. That means I'm enjoyin' this s---."") an' although it is funny, my favorite scene comes right after they question the two ladies who were s'posedly in cahoots with the killers, when Nolte an' Murphy finally drop the trash-talkin' an' jus' have a drunken brawl in the street only to be broken up by two cops on the beat.
This is the original buddy cop flick. With two guys who're ironically ANYTHING but buddies. Depending on the way you've come up watching movies, this one will either be a wonderfully offensive cop thriller, or a horribly offensive cop thriller. Of course, no matter how you look at it, '48 HRS.' will forever be a hallmark, because it was one'a the first movies of its kind: a rough-edged, blatant politically-incorrect film centering on characters that are so sleazy at times you hafta force yourself to like them, an' revolving around racial stereotypes an' sexist banter thas' thrown around like it's nothing, not to mention some brutal violence. Now it'd be much harder to overlook all the coldness if it wasn't for the charm an' appeal of Eddie Murphy, in his film debut. He is the main reason to watch the flick, although Nolte's character also provides the perfect counterbalance. Directed by Walter Hill, '48 HRS.' set a new standard for the way action flicks were to be played for the rest of the 1980s. With laughs, wit, chemistry, an' a not-so-serious attitude set against a very serious backdrop.",1047254400,3,3315,4.775261324041812
255840,5,6300213749,"This is a film that will have you laughing from beginning to end as it transforms that ""good cop teams up with a villan"" theme.

Authorities gave 48 hrs to find the money and the men so they must take every evidence they have to find the money and the fugitive inmates.
A little issue I found is that the packet says that it have English captions when in reality there isn't any.
