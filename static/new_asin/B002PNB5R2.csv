8443026,3,B002PNB5R2,Very good content. Video quality is dated (VCR image quality). Would be a great product if remastered as the content of this video is good for training or as a refresher. Be careful when ordering multiple discs in this video series. The seller charges shipping for each video and ships it in one shipping envelope.,1429833600,2,314,4.7272727272727275
