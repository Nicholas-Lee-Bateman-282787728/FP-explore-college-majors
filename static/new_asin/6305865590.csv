1083588,2,6305865590,"My wife is a sixth grade teacher and they are just finishing the book Hatchet. We rented this movie thinking she could watch it in her class, but we were wrong. Half way through the movie we realized it is PG and she would not show it to her class. It would be a good compare and contrast due to the fact that there are many differences between the book and movie. We are glad that we reviewed it at home first.",1131321600,,411,4.024390243902439
1083589,4,6305865590,"This movie took you back to the basics of movies without all the new fuddy duddy stuff added to everything you watch.  It had believable plots and really nice nature sceens.

It is about a kid who's parents divorced and he is flying to Canada to visit his father.  During transit the pilot dies of a heart attack and the plan lands into a large lake in a mountainous region and sinks with all his belongings except the hatchet his mother gave him before he left on his trip.  This hatchet was attached to his belt, and it literally saves his life as he uses it remarkably to build shelter and the such. The movie illustrates how he had to survive off the land and to protect himself from preditors (not violent).  I do not really recall a lot of bad language or bloody sceens and the only time the kid is unclothed is when they show a glimpse of him diving into the water to bathe.  If you like low key movies this one you'll like!",1105401600,18,931,4.231638418079096
1083590,1,6305865590,"Okay, I'm in the sixth grade, and we just read this book in class, and then watched the movie. I can't freaking believe that Gary Paulsen consented this, much less wrote the screenplay. It's a horrible movie, and does no justice to the book. I liked the book. For some reason it reminded me of Lord of the Flies, except it was less depressing, cuz there weren't a bunch of kids running around killing eachother. Brian had some character, and there was an intellectual side to the book, but the movie..urgh. It was a mockery.",1052611200,6,524,4.526315789473684
1083591,4,6305865590,"The reviewers below state that this movie is not worthy of the excellent Gary Paulsen novel. I hate to break this to you, guys, but Gary Paulsen was one of the two screenplay writers of this film. Of course it's not going to be better than the book; no movie ever is. However, it is a pretty good movie in itself. It can stand on its own, and follows the book pretty closely. The movie is about a twelve-year-old boy whose plane crashes in the Canadien wilderness when the pilot has a heart attack. He is the only survivor, and must fend for himself against the many dangers of the wilderness. In a 90-minute movie, there is not much time for character development, as there was in the hundreds of pages alotted for the book. The only thing that bothered me was why the DVD did not have a time counter. This is the only DVD I have ever viewed in which that was the case.",1003190400,10,870,4.246987951807229
1083592,1,6305865590,"This video is a travesty.  It claims to be based on the excellent children's book _Hatchet_ by Gary Paulsen.
 This video adds gratuitous profanity to the story, not in the book's text, which makes it unsuitable for many classrooms and age levels.
 The video also butchers the plot of the book, and has Brian doing idiotic things which he doesn't do in the book.  For instance, Brian uses the blade of his hatchet to mark days in stone.  Brian wildly hacks at the lake's water with his hatchet to catch fish.  And Brian adopts orphaned bear cubs, managing to catch enough fish for them to grow up on (which they seem to do in a day).
 In one of his author tour appearances, Gary Paulsen himself said that he didn't like this film (I don't recall his exact words).
 ...
 This video is not only a waste of time, but is seemingly written/directed by folks who were intentionally trying to wreck the feeling, sentiment and message of Paulsen's book.  This is not a mere jazzing up, or telescoping of events to fit the movie time and format.  This is really bad.  Skip this piece of junk;  get the _Hatchet_ unabridged audio book instead.",995068800,8,1132,4.517241379310345
1083593,3,6305865590,"As a professor of Reading Education, I use the book, Hatchet, and this video to demonstrate to teachers-in training that books and videos can both serve a purpose in the classroom.  First we read the book.  With undergraduates, I read the book to them, one chapter per day.  With graduate students, they read the book on their own.  After we've read the book, we do a ""compare and contrast"" comprehension activity.  Students are expected to write notes about how the two media are similar and different.  Using an ""H"" compare and contrast page (one leg of the H is for Hatchet, one for A Cry in the Wild -- the horizontal leg is used for common items in the book and movie).  Once students see and hear Paulsen's talent for crafting words, the movie always is ranked as a distant second.  The video also illustrates what Hollywood must do to command a person's attention.  For the modest price of the video, it's an excellent way to demonstrate to students of all ages, the power of books over video.",988243200,52,1000,4.573033707865169

It is a great story of the strength in all of us, and how with the right state of mind and attitude that anybody can accomplish amazing things. The story of an average kid surviving under seemingly impossible odds can be a great inspiration to kids and can be a good conversation starter with your kids not only about the types of things they can do in an emergency to help themselves, but also how their attitude and approach to a situation can affect it's outcome. I also suggest the related book, as it gives a lot more insight into what is going on in the main characters mind through his whole ordeal.",1439337600,4,816,4.339869281045751

1084439,4,6305865590,"This movie is not the greatest cinematically...a little cheesy and poorly acted at times but overall good for the time period it was made in. That being said this movie is a great extention for teachers using the book hatchet and trying to teach common core standards which relate to comparing a book with media. My fifth grade students and I enjoyed it and those who have trouble with reading comprehension benefited from having the visuals. We watch the movie as we read the book and did a side by side comparison. I even used it to encourage my students to do their homework since if you didn't do you homework you had to spend that days movie time doing it for half credit. My students and I also had a lot of great discussions about the differences in Brian's character from the book to the movie especially because the writer of the book was also the screen writer for the movie. Two of my students even asked to borrow the movie so they could watch it again they liked it so much.

BE WARNED- there are bad words in this movie despite its PG rating (including son of a b**** and sh**) and Brian also swims nude in the film though you can't really see anything because the water distorts the view and 2 of my students went home and told there parents that I let them watch a PG 13 movie with tons of swear words and naked scenes. I had to have 2 conferences over this movie and luckily administration sided with me since our district policy says PG and G movies are ok (though it has been suggested that I make the movie available to parents to preview and send out a letter about the movie prior to showing it if I choose to use it again). At the end of the day Im sure that I will use it again since my students need to compare books and movies and this book is such a hit with my reluctant readers.
My final word on this movie is: buy it and show it with the book it is worth it to help your students with comprehension and with standards about comparisons. It opens up a lot of good disucssions. Just make sure you don't get in hot water over some of the content.",1419897600,,2073,4.221662468513854

1084518,4,6305865590,"Gary Paulson's Hatchet was a favorite book of mine as a youth, and now a father myself my son is reading the various books centered about Paulson's character Brian Robeson. I might be biased as such a fan of the books, but this movie was a must have movie when I found out it existed.
This movie is most definitely 'dated', and has the feeling of being somewhat low-budget. The child who plays Brian is adequate even though the acting seems awkward at times. It is a heavy responsibility for any actor to essentially carry a movie on their own without other actors (think Tom Hanks in Castaway), which is what we see here as the bulk of the movie is Brian facing survival in the wild on his own.
Some nitpicky things for me were some scenes not found in the book, like Brian nearly wrestling with a bear and later killing it. There were also flashbacks of Brian's previous home life dispersed throughout the movie, which even if served a needed function of contrast, they were exxagerated.
All in all, I and my 9 year old son enjoyed it. :::Spoiler::: Aside from the graphic scene of Brian encountering the dead pilot's body in the downed plane when he dives for the emergency kit stored there, and a bit of tense action with encountering bears, there was nothing innapropriate for children of any ages really.",1401148800,,1310,4.555084745762712

1084757,4,6305865590,"I'll start by saying I've not read the book, so I looked at the movie more for ""what it was"" than ""what it wasn't"".  What it is, is a good story of a boy caught up in all kinds of bad things beyond his control and not just surviving; but triumphing.
Accidentally discovering his mom is having an affair.  Watching his dad pack up and leave.  Oh, and having the only other person in your plane (who just happens to be the pilot) die right before your eyes, riding the plane out of radio range 'till your flying coffin runs out of fuel and crashes in a remote northern lake can suck too!
The movie is perhaps not as polished and handed to you on a silver platter as some here might like.  There are point one can fault and poke at if one wishes.  But the cinematography is great, and the young actor carries his role well.  While the character of Brian is lucky, he's also a young man reacting genuinely to what life hands him AND using his brain.  There's nothing presented there so far as survival, that a young person who is not a stranger to thinking couldn't come up with.
And perhaps it not being so ""polished"" brings an air of ""real-life"" and ""genuine"".  One can easily believe this is a young person reacting as a boy in that situation would.  You can easily believe he is totally cut off from the world -- rather than just being an actor surrounded by dozens of support and artistic staff watching him perform.  I think the plot flows, the flashbacks work, the setting is perfect, and Jared's portrayal of a boy abandoned first by parents then by the world, professionally delivered.
Not too many spoilers, but my favourite moments were the worms, how nonchalantly he handled the opening of the survival pack and tossed aside the survival guide (having already learned what he needed on his own), and how casually he greeted his rescuer, asking him if he wanted some supper!

The ending gave a lot to think about too.  Brian's reaction to the plethora of food suddenly laid out before him; comforts and luxuries galore; the look and smile he gave his mom; how well he handled mom's new boyfriend; his taking his place at the head of the family table not as a hurt boy, but as a recovering young adult.
(Those reviewers guffawing that he seems to have done this ""without therapy"" under-sell the resilience of the Human spirit greatly.)

A good watch if you like survival movies, coming-of-age movies, can relate to childhood abandonment issues like divorce . . . and are willing to grant a respectable movie enough artistic license to truly connect with what the writer is trying to convey.",1326931200,,2596,4.521367521367521

1084761,3,6305865590,"Based on the novel, ""Hatchet,"" by Gary Paulsen, this film focuses on a young boy who finds himself in the middle of the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. With very minimal equipment (his hatchet and Mother Nature), he must do all he can to survive in the wild before help arrives (if it ever does). A Cry in the Wild is basically a standard survival film, but it does have some beautiful scenery throughout. The production value is limited, so it does look very low-budget at times, but it's saved by some impressive camerawork. The minimal music sounds nice, and the film moves along nicely without being too slow or too quick. The performances are unfortunately lackluster: Jared Rushton gives a poor performance as the main character, but I give him credit for at least trying to act. Sue Martin and Meadows give average performances as the parents. Ned Beatty gives a slightly better performance, even if he only has five minutes of screen time.

All in all, A Cry in the Wild is a beautiful-looking film. The natural scenery makes up for some wooden performances in the film. I would still recommend it as a guide on how to survive in the wild.

Grade: 6.2 out of 10",1318118400,3,1178,4.604761904761904
1084785,5,6305865590,"This is an EXCELLENT FILM for many reasons. VERY REALISTIC and the plot holds strong throughout. It teaches you how to use your head in the wild. Many people don't know very much what to do in a stranded situation; how to use whatever resources you have around you (in ways you've never imagined), etc. Even through mistakes you learn and you eventually master. The film keeps your attention and you wonder what the boy is going to do in each obstacle. With the understanding that the boy is obviously upset and disturbed by the divorce/separation of his parents (the film shows a few short flashbacks of memories), he faces himself in a whole new light when he is alone in the nature, fighting to survive outward battles as well as inward battles. He becomes more of a man through it all and in the end acts more mature with his mother. (As for usage of bad words (cussing), I watched the movie on TV, so, sometimes they take out any bad words compared to the DVD. I have to say though that I can't believe they would put bad language in this family film - wouldn't make sense for the genre!) You can also see, that, even there are dangers in the nature, as is in the city too, the nature has a way of transforming kids to be more rounded, more mature individuals, through respect, a wild innocence and a joyous peace. I would say that A CRY IN THE WILD is very much like a young-people's 'Cast Away'.
