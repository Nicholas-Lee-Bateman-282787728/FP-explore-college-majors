3788716,5,B001TC6KIO,"If you are considering purchasing Release, I highly recommend it!  It's 55 minutes, but the last 10 or so are spent doing stretches that make you feel totally relaxed after your workout.  The workout itself is GREAT.  Having bought several yoga/pilates videos over the past few years, Release is above and beyond anything I've bought in the past.  For one, I never DREAD doing it; in fact, I find myself looking forward to it.  Once I finish...I feel totally refreshed!  After using this video 5 times...I can already notice a difference in the toning of my arms, legs and abs.  Also, unlike some videos, you never feel annoyed with the instructors.  Both Leah and Suzanne are great.  Sometimes they chime in with, ""Come on, you can do this!"" and it actually motivates me to hold the poses longer than I may have otherwise.

I'm very excited to own this video and I've told all my friends and family about it.  This is a must-have!!!",1241740800,6,933,4.628048780487805

 I was thrilled when I got my copy of this phenomenal workout DVD! Postural movement and flow is very different than what I am used to. I love, love, love the exercises in this workout.  The workout starts with lower body exercises to make your muscles burn in your butt, hips, and thighs. Exercises include variations of chair pose, lunge sequences, side lunges, plie squats, and sit-backs. The exercises alternate holds with movement for a higher calorie burn and to make your muscles shake! The floor work is intense as well with plank to push up variations, bridge work, side planks,  and weight-less  arm work (no dumbells needed! ). Abdominal work is felt from the very beginning of the floor work during the plank series, and continues at the end with C-curve exercises to isometrically work the abs.  The workout ends with great stretches for the entire body for ten minutes followed by ten minutes of relaxation- very soothing.  The music helps you stay motivated during the workout, but very restful during the stretches and relaxation. It is amazing how this  DVD will make you feel after the workout- completely rejuvenated!  The next day my muscles were very sore! I will keep using this workout DVD every week! You need to experience this video!",1239235200,6,1407,5.3881278538812785
3788718,5,B001TC6KIO,"As a mother of eight, I have nothing but great things to say about this exercise regimen.  I have found that most home workouts don't give you much of a workout and waste your precious workout time.  Often you feel like just when your muscles are getting warmed up, they move onto something else, or even worse...its over.  They also spend too much time in setting up each exercise.

Not so with Release, I've never felt such a deliciously painful burn in my legs and arms.  No time is wasted in set up.  The movements are simple and graceful, yet effective.

I haven't seen a narrative style before, but think its brilliant!  It flows with the music to make the killer exercises suprisingly relaxing.

I highly recommend Release to anyone who wants to make the most of their exercise time.  You will feel thoroughly worked out from head to foot...while also wonderfully stretched and relaxed.",1238630400,6,893,4.703225806451613
3788719,5,B001TC6KIO,"I couldn't wait to try this video after using and loving Suzanne's other 3 DVDs.  I hadn't tried anything by Leah yet, but she seemed just as great as Suzanne in this selection.

First things first,  the video is about 50 minutes long.  It includes standing work, floor work, and stretching with relaxation.  If you do the whole video, you will get a full body workout.  You don't need any equipment for this video (a huge plus!)  Maybe a mat, if you want one, but you could do the exercise on carpet too and you don't even need that much space.

This video is good for beginners and advanced exercisers alike.  Suzanne is pregnant in the program, so she demonstrates the modifications, which should be easy enough for anyone to follow if they are not up for following Leah who demonstrates much more challenging moves at times.  I am in great shape.  I work out 7 days a week for at least an hour a day. I weigh between 110-115.  Doing everything in advanced mode is still very difficult for me at times (especially the plank series - I have to drop down to my knees for a few seconds usually).  The only part I wasn't really that impressed with was the abs section.  First of all, it seems too brief and second of all, it's all performed on your back - shoulders off the ground.  This always causes me a lot of neck strain.  Also, my abs are pretty developed, so I didn't feel this was much of a challenge (even going with the advanced choices).  I guess from Suzanne and Leah, I was just expecting a little more creative ab exercises.  This is my only gripe about the video!  The rest is truly an amazing workout.  The music, as others have mentioned, is beautiful and soothing.  There is an option on the video to turn off Leah's voice over and just workout to music.  I think this would be cool after you have learned all the instruction.

The stretching portion is very good.  For some reason, it seems to make my body feel better than most other stretches I've done on different videos.  Maybe it's just the music, but it's a nice relieving feeling.  There is a nice addition at the end of the video - 10 minutes of the music for relaxation time.  I admit, it's hard to just lay there and not do anything.  If you're like me and your brain is hard to turn off and you're thinking of a million things you need to do, it's literally tough to make yourself just lay there, but force yourself because it is very peaceful if you can... even if you don't do it for the whole 10 minutes.

One last thing to add... Leah and Suzanne mention it at the beginning of the video, but this is more of a toning and muscle tension release workout.  If you want the best results, you need to do some cardio on top of this video.  While you will be burning calories doing this, it's really not a cardio workout.  Leah and Suzanne reccommend doing Release about 3 to 4 times a week.  I've been combining this with some Taebo and Jillian Michael's 30 day shred.  It works very well.  It may sound strange, but I like to do Release at about 8 o'clock at night before I go to bed because it relaxes my muscles.  Good luck to all!  Go Suzanne and Leah!  I can't wait for more videos!",1237420800,27,3166,4.2944162436548226
3788720,5,B001TC6KIO,"I am a person who does not like workout videos, but this video is so different.  I am a person who has a lot of stress in my life, and this was the most relaxing and feel good workout video I have ever experienced.  The workout was very intense, but I felt like I had a massage afterwards because it works the muscles so deeply followed by stretching and relaxation. I was definitely sore the next day, but I couldn't wait to do the video again.  I can see that my muscles look longer and leaner - not bulky.  The music is also relaixing, but rejuvenating. This workout DVD is a must have!",1235088000,19,589,4.185840707964601
3788721,5,B001TC6KIO,"This video is terrific.  It's great to finally have a video that doesn't spend half the time explaining the exercise over and over, each time you do the video.  Once or twice through the video and you can just do it without the pauses for a the beginner.  It's very calming. The music is great to work out to.  It's my favorite exercise video and I can see the results already.",1235088000,2,377,4.267605633802817
3788722,5,B001TC6KIO,I absolutely love this work out! It is so different than any other video out there. Leah and Suzanne have mastered a technique that doesn't strain my muscles and it's great for all levels. Leah's voice and the background music are so peaceful. I'm already seeing the results!,1235001600,,275,4.75
3788723,5,B001TC6KIO,"Suzanne and Leah have done it again...Release Workout is a fantastic mind/body balancing, toning, and energizing workout. Being able to customize my workout each time allows me to feel in control of what I feel I need to target. The ladies are excellent guides and effectively coach through the movements; hence enabling me to better my form and physique while having a great time doing so! This is not your everyday average at home workout video...

A Must Have!",1234828800,,463,4.860759493670886

3788725,4,B001TC6KIO,"This workout doesn't easily fit in any category, but it really does provide a great workout. The combination of planks and eccentric arm work really works the arms (hard!) and the various yoga-inspired leg positions give the legs a good workout too. The ab work is good (although I'd avoid if you have neck issues).
Leah instructs by voiceover, with Leah and Suzanne working out together (Suzanne provides modifications).
I'd definitely recommend having some experience in yoga or Pilates before doing this, as they assume a basic knowledge of some positions.

3788726,5,B001TC6KIO,"I am a mommy of 6 children and have used many workouts throughout my lifetime, but this one has done more for me than any others.  I have done well with my pregnancies and have managed to get back to my pre-pregnancy figure.  After my 6th child,  I found this video after using Susanne Bowen's Long and Lean prenatal workout during my pregnancy.  I not only got into shape much faster but have so much more muscle tone and even a better figure.  I love the way this video stretches and tones all muscle groups and is challenging, but doable.  It is also easy to follow!  My husband is constantly complimenting me on my tone arms, shoulders and legs and this is the only video I do!  Love the way I feel when I'm done... not exhausted, but refreshed!!",1377129600,2,750,4.345323741007194
3788727,5,B001TC6KIO,"This tape is amazing! Just hard enough to give you a great workout and manageable enough to leave you wanting to try it agian. I really liked doing this tape, and would highly recommend it to anyone. These two women are very inspiring and helpful in your journey to healthiness and wholeness.",1334620800,,292,4.634615384615385
3788728,5,B001TC6KIO,"I am a trainer/instructor (pilates, bootcamp) and I LOVE this video.  The chaptering is well done: Lower body (standing, Upper body I, Upper body II, Stretch, Relaxation/Meditation).  This is a great workout that is under an hour, so it is easy to fit in.  Perfect if you not in the mood to run or jump around...I love this addition to add to my non-cardio or heavy weights day.  Sometimes a full yoga class is too much and this video combines a little yoga and and a little pilates in one.  I also enjoy the relaxation and the end of the video.  This is one of my favorite low-impact, yoga/pilates videos...and, I have most of them!

It has great cueing and modifications for the novice.  I highly recommend this video.",1326067200,4,720,4.5271317829457365
3788729,5,B001TC6KIO,"I love this workout! Suzanne Bowen and Leah Sarago do a great job in having a diverse workout leaving you feeling fully rejuvenated, restored and relaxed while you will feel you have worked out all your body. I love this workout because it is a great complement to other pilates and yoga Dvds, the all dvd atmosphere is serene but Suzanne and Leah keep you motivated to follow through all the exercises. I enjoy the fact that it's a complete workout without all the repetition of crunches and monotone lunges. Don't be bothered by the title ""release"", you'll get some sweat out of the workout. I'd love to see the pair doing more Dvds.",1301184000,8,635,4.578947368421052
3788730,5,B001TC6KIO,"I can not express how much I love this workout. The production was very simple and very basic. The exercises are very clean/ to the point & so effective. I began sweating more than I would if I was doing an hour of Taebo! This is the perfect workout to keep me sane before & after work & I'm shocked at how much I'm building strength & how quickly. I usually don't go by other's reviews because you have to know what works best for you & what fits your personality/ style. If you're looking for a calming workout w/ Christian music (Soothing music done by Kimberly & Alberto Rivera) that brings peace to the soul- this is it. If you're looking for a strictly yoga workout, then this may not be a good fit for you. But this was the perfect fit for me :-)",1281484800,8,753,4.164383561643835
3788731,5,B001TC6KIO,"I use many workout DVDs, I exercise daily and have been involved in many sports such as gymnastics and basketball throughout my life.  I enjoy this DVD because it is different and challenging.  I was amazed that the first few times performing the workout it seemed difficult but afterward I felt rejuvenated and stretched.

The standing series is good for toning your legs and improving your posture I believe.  The floor series 1 is pretty challenging as many of the moves are plank moves.  In the beginning I couldn't get through the segment.  I kept working at them (now I can do the segment without modification) and they have helped my overall arm and shoulder strength immensely.  The abs section is good, but my favorite is the stretching and relaxation.  It is a nice segment with beautiful music.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone, it is relaxing and has helped my posture, strength and flexibility.",1262563200,2,912,4.794871794871795
3788732,4,B001TC6KIO,"I agree with the reviewer Red Panda, that the instructors should have left out ""sales spiel"" statements about arm circles burning the fat off your arms. There is also no cardio component to this workout in my opinion. I also agree that the intensity is not advanced. But I would rate it as intermediate rather than beginner. In pilates and yoga you need to practise with mindfulness and focus on alignment to feel the moves. Unless you have some prior experienced at these styles, the cueing in the video does not have sufficient pointers on form and range of motion. If you have some background in these styles or naturally high proprioception skills, I feel this is a very good add on to a collection of at home workouts.

For strength training, I rely on on conventional weight training. Yet, I enjoy mixing in yoga or yoga fusion style workouts into my routine. I think they complement the strength training that weights provide and work synergistically on strength, stamina, balance and flexibility. The emhpasis of Release is mainly on ""toning"" or strength (but more gentle rather than advanced strength challenges) and some-what on stamina. The moves are interesting - I haven't seen many of them before in other videos. Time passes quickly. The instructors are graceful and show great form. The music is wonderful. The production is professional. It is a great workout to use on lighter training days even for adcvanced exercisers.

I agree with the reviewer who commented on the abs/core sequence. It can aggravate pre-existing neck strain issues. It would have been nice to see at least some exercises in this segment that were more neck friendly. But this did not detract from the usability for me.

In summary, I am glad I picked up this video and recommend it to anyone who enjoys  pilates/yoga fusion.",1257638400,10,1815,4.864077669902913
3788733,5,B001TC6KIO,"This is a really well thought out and developed workout.  I am new to this type of exercise and when I first saw the movements in the sample video I wondered how they could be that effective, but believe me they are!! You really feel well worked all over. My sister does this video regularly and I can't believe the way it has lifted her once flat butt! It has given it a real JLo look. Her husband is thrilled and I am inspired to get the same!  I am also feeling generally stronger all over, and energized rather than drained as some exercise can leave you feeling. This is definately a top fitness video by some real professionals.",1242864000,2,634,4.319327731092437
8340951,5,B001TC6KIO,"Suzanne Bowen is great.  This is an excellent DVD, a must buy.",1464825600,,62,4.166666666666667

8340953,5,B001TC6KIO,"I bought this back in 2012 and have used it a few times since then.  I recently used it again, on a day when I knew I needed to move, but I wasn't up for much exertion.  Once I started the DVD, I remembered how much I liked the music, the set, the instructor, the movements, etc.  I thought, ""Oh, yes, this is perfect!""  Then when we started the floor work, I remembered how hard the arm portions can be!  There is stamina involved in the standing arm work and strength needed for the arm work when on the floor. However, modifications are shown.

This is a nice blend of pilates and yoga inspired moves.  The 15-minute lower body portion is standing.  The upper body portion is about 15 minutes. The core work, lots of pilates moves, is about 10 mintues.  There is a nice stretch section followed by a 10-minute savasana.

If you're someone who's bored by pilates or yoga, this might be the perfect DVD for you.  If you're a yoga enthusiast, as I am, it's a nice change of pace.  It's a graceful, flowing and well put together workout. It's nice for a light day.

I'm not sure who's doing the voice over, Suzanne Bowen or Leah Sarago.  Whichever one it is, she has a soothing voice.

The music is by Alberto Rivera, according to the DVD cover, and it's wonderful.

It's a lightly energizing workout due to so many things - the workout, the music, the set, the lighting, the instructor's voice, etc.

Compared to Warrior, this one is more upper body intensive.  If I remember correctly,Warrior focuses more on the lower body. Both are great.",1436140800,,1541,4.442857142857143
8340954,5,B001TC6KIO,"I have Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue and this DVD was a welcome find.  Prior to getting sick, I used to be a cardio junky, and it's been very difficult to find exercises that I can physically do now AND that I actually like doing.  This DVD is great for those days when I'm too fatigued for fast-paced exercises and/or when I'm too weak and sore to lift any weights.  I don't expect that it will restore me to my prior state of fitness, but it provides a solid 40 minutes of body weight movements that I can make it through without overtaxing myself while still feeling like I did something at the end.  It is also quite calming and relaxing, which helps to keep me mentally engaged on those days when I would find a healthy and energetic instructor too daunting.  It's not a DVD I would have found particularly challenging before I got sick, but it does the trick now.

I still use it even though I'm back to my regular Fitness routine and love it as an end of the day workout when I'm less motivated!
