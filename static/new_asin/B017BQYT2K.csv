8738557,5,B017BQYT2K,"I had heard about J.W. ""Blind"" Boone being a piano prodigy.  A man who could hear a tune one time and then replicate it flawlessly.  I always wanted to know more about him and this dvd provides a nice historical perspective on the life of a remarkable man.  While this is not a glitzy special effects kind of story, it is nicely put together and gives a viewer a well documented and deep insight into the man, his career and his music. If you want to know more about a man who overcame a severe loss and went on to international acclaim, I highly recommend this work.  This is a man who preceded Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder and who showed the world what could be accomplished even without sight at a time when travel was harder and life in general was harder.  It is truly an uplifting story and should make us all a little more grateful for what we have.  My one complaint is that it is not easy to find on Amazon.  If you simply search Prodigy it will not show up. I searched for blind boone in all departments and found it. I highly recommend this dvd if you are interested in a well written and performed story about the human spirit and how much a person can overcome.",1448582400,,1175,4.242152466367713
