4047715,3,B0030Y12BY,"I saw this movie when it aired on MTV, and my recommendation is to catch it there.  It's not horrible by any means, but to me (as a dancer) the dance sequences were too few, too short, and too choppily-edited to make up for some of the storytelling and acting flaws in the picture.

We expect a certain story arc in a dance movie, same as in a sports movie, but one thing I have little patience with is the idea that a complete unknown could or would be hired to produce a big event (see ""Honey"" for a very similar story).  Just not going to happen, folks.  I don't care how cute she is.  Someone with money on the line is going to hire a producer and choreographer with an actual resume.

Personally, my favorite scene was when the dancer's mom walked out on her bossy, judgy husband to go and see the show.",1273190400,4,808,4.180645161290323
4047716,1,B0030Y12BY,"The dancing in this movie is fun to watch. However, as a movie, the storytelling is incoherent, the plot is trite, and the characters are flat. There were multiple points during the movie where the it seemed to skip forward or backward in time without any kind of reference point, leaving me as a viewer lost and confused. If you're not a huge fan of dancing, skip this movie.",1272758400,,376,4.463768115942029

8386317,3,B0030Y12BY,"to see, but (for a very critical me) not a keeper. Cool music--new twists on great 70's tunes & good dancing too. But kinda skimpy on both. The most annoying thing, though, was all of the dissolves, probably because it was an MTV movie with built in breaks for (apparently) commercials.",1368835200,,286,4.627450980392157
8386318,5,B0030Y12BY,I give this movie a 5 star due to great dance scenes a  believable story-line and Romina D'Ugo - looking at her alone for over an hour is time well spent!,1363046400,,154,3.967741935483871
