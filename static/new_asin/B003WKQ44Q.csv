4214136,5,B003WKQ44Q,"Nova: Building the Great Cathedrals combines art history, architecture, history, biblical analysis, and a dash of mystery in this hour long program.  The program seeks to answer the question: How did medieval engineers construct these massive structures of stone and glass?  Modern technology reveals that while some of these magnificent cathedrals have so far withstood the test of time, some are actually on the brink of collapsing.  Architects, art historians, historians, and modern construction workers take you through the process of how medieval engineers would have made the plans and how they are currently working to ensure the vitality of these structures.  Additionally, historians try to decipher whether or not a particular Biblical code was used in the construction of these cathedrals.  A little under an hour, this program easily holds the audience's attention.  This is a perfect program for a high school course, lower division college course, or even for the general history buff interested in medieval history.",1304726400,8,1031,5.452830188679245
4214137,4,B003WKQ44Q,"I've always been interested in stone construction, whether it involved castles or cathedrals.  This video illustrated the challenges building with stone presented and the skills the builders had, building structures that still stand after hundreds of years.",1302739200,4,257,5.945945945945946
4214138,4,B003WKQ44Q,"This is a good video to show a college class, so long as you warn them that many of the ""discoveries"" that NOVA claims to make in the course of the video are actually pretty old scholarship (and that a number of the scholars who appear are being taken out of context).  My students enjoyed the DVD a great deal, and we're having a good time critiquing some of the claims in the video as we progress through the semester.",1298419200,12,420,4.25
4214139,5,B003WKQ44Q,Bought this as a gift for my daughter who is a student of one of the professors in this video. My husband and I saw this on TV and wanted to get our daughter a copy of this terrific show. Amazing pics!,1294099200,3,201,3.8095238095238093
4214140,5,B003WKQ44Q,"Although this is a short, one hour work, it is a wonderfully filmed and professionally written introduction to some of the great Gothic cathedrals of France. Because the production is so new  -- it was released in late 2010 -- the production has extremely recent footage of Amiens, Beauvais, and Notre Dame of Paris, with some shots of Chartres, Noyon, and the ruins at Ourscamp as additional teasers. The show is excellent for anyone wishing to be introduced to these marvelous structures, and even has a few unusual tidbits thrown in even for seasoned Gothic enthusiasts.

The episode focuses on the essential structural components of Gothic architecture, and keeps the narrative simple by focusing on the three most significant structural methods at use in the Gothic enterprise: pointed arches, flying buttresses, and ribbed vaulting. The video footage is absolutely first-rate, with most all of the footage new, and filmed with extremely good equipment (although this is not, sadly, high definition). In addition, the computer images that are used to illustrate the discussion are extremely well done, embedded directly within the video footage itself. If you think you'll have trouble visualizing the content, all you have to do is sit back and watch. The computer illustrations overlaid upon the video footage makes it all plain as day.

If you've had the chance to visit Beauvais, Amiens, Chartres, and Notre Dame, this video will bring back both warm memories, but will also help you to look afresh at these structures in a new way. If you've not yet had the chance to visit these structures, this video can serve as both your introduction to them and also as a teaser to do so as soon as possible. Although we can quibble at some of the numerical ""coding"" content at the end of the production that seems more an attempt to draw in the Da Vinci Code crowd, don't let that keep you away from a beautifully filmed and wonderfully illustrated look at French Gothic cathedrals. Highly recommended.",1291680000,50,2002,4.970149253731344
4214141,5,B003WKQ44Q,"Excellent program covering the very impressive design and building of Europe's great cathedrals, impressive structures accomplished before modern engineering or construction. An ancient Roman hoisting machine allows workers to life six times their own weight - the 150 lb. stones are well within the limit. Pressure from the weight of the stones and precise alignment are more important to keeping things in place than the limited mortar of the day. Flying buttresses, arches, ribbed vaults, and in one case, an iron chain are also key, and allowed walls to contain large stained-glass windows.

Some center areas were more than 12 stories high. Was interesting to also learn of how some of the measurements were specifically selected from the Bible, partly in an effort to create a sensation of heaven on earth.",1287792000,21,812,5.198473282442748

This program has both the history and the architecture to keep a math-mind, medievalist, or just a curious-about-science and history mind interested!  The video is first-rate, as this is a recently made (2010) production, and the snap-shots of famous cathedrals (Notre Dame, Chartres, and Amiens to name a few) are fantastic!

4214150,5,B003WKQ44Q,"This is a very interesting DVD, from the PBS Nova series, about the design of Gothic cathedrals and the architectural and construction techniques used to build them.

It goes into the Biblical inspiration for the design, the architectural and construction techniques involved and the engineering problems associated with the design, with required the use of architectural features like flying buttresses to support the structure.

The section showing the use of 3D laser imaging to map the interior of cathedrals and to detect potential structural weakness is very interesting.

Overall, a very interesting DVD that should appeal to anyone interested in art, architecture, engineering, history and Christian theology.",1424476800,,717,5.682242990654205

4214161,5,B003WKQ44Q,"Very well made film. I am a professor of religion so I am a tough viewer. This documentary is overall quite a good introduction to the medieval cathedral and situates it in the social, religious, and political developments of the time. It has a quite silly and vaguely preposterous storyline about ""secret biblical numbers"" built into the cathedrals, playing to the Dan Brown mystical conspiracy fans out there. Some of the uses of these ""biblical numbers"" were standard religious architectural tropes and hardly remarkable, others that the documentary considers to are most likely coincidences. Regardless, the film is excellent overall.",1364860800,,638,5.39

4214167,4,B003WKQ44Q,"This is a good introduction to gothic cathedrals for a general audience.  Their design and construction was an achievement which appropriately inspires awe even today, and I think this program gives us a good sense of why that is.

Looking at it from my engineering background, I did feel that some technical concepts were oversimplified and some terminology was misused - probably because the people interviewed apparently weren't engineers - but this isn't a fatal flaw and the content of the program was accurate enough for its purposes.  And indeed, I learned some things too (engineers today don't design gothic cathedrals!).

My biggest issue with the program, and the reason I've deducted one star, is that the religious connection hypothesized in the last third of the program is highly dubious.  They claim that design proportions drawn from the Bible and other religious texts were the key to making these structures stable, but the reality is that successful design proportions were the result of trial and error over a long period of time.  Sorry, there was no 'divine revelation' going on here.

Recommended, but take the last third of the program with a major grain of salt.",1336348800,10,1188,5.030612244897959

4214170,5,B003WKQ44Q,"How did they do it?  No computers or even heavy equipment, but these buildings soared skyward and many have been standing for centuries!  This program explains the critical measurement and mathematical formulas they used.  But they were not always perfect.  Some collapsed, and others have had dramatic methods to save them.  Modern technology, especially laser beams can do precise measurements and show the stress points in the arches.  Excellent information on the stained glass windows as well.",1318118400,2,498,5.402597402597403
4214171,4,B003WKQ44Q,"The latest in scientific technology is used to better understand the construction and in some cases structural failure of some of the world's greatest cathedrals.  No matter how you look at it, it is still amazing that such magnificent buildings could have been conceived and built many centuries ago with much less scientific understanding.  A very informative video, a shame that it runs less than an hour, though.",1305072000,4,416,5.102941176470588

8407373,5,B003WKQ44Q,"''Aristotle, Euclid, Pythagoras were revered by the medieval thinkers at Chartres. They were steeped in Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, science and literature. They seized on the idea that the supreme beauty of the universe is based on perfect proportions and ideal numbers. They saw god as a divine mathematician, a divine geometer.''

Interesting that mathematics is now not only revered, but just about worshiped as the key to all 'science'. Medieval thinkers understood the source mathematical structure of the universe, the mind of God. Moderns have a difficult time finding a sensible cause for ''the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics'', as noted by physicist Eugene Wigner.

''Taller than Egyptian pyramids, large enough to hold the Statue of Liberty, they are 100 million pounds of stone.''

How did medieval builders do it?

Shows team in California reconstructing a cathedral that Hearst bought and transported there. Never rebuilt. Team has spent years learning and working. Some of the key innovations are explained using their experience. The huge difference a pointed (Roman) arch makes compared to a older rounded one. Flying buttresses transfer the weight of a stone roof to the outside, enabling thinner walls, including much glass. This was a revolution in building.

Video explains that many of the construction decisions are religiously driven. For example, many are built in the shape of a cross. The enormous stained glass walls (can hardly be seen as windows) both allow the 'light of God' to influence the worshippers, but also to relate bible stories to educate the viewer.

Also relates that these were community, citywide projects that could take a hundred years. What contrast to today's world!

Nevertheless, the competition with other cities leads to dangers. The higher the building, the greater the danger. This work spends time showing the reasons and problems of some famous cathedrals. Uses computer models and laser measuring tools. Easy to follow and interesting. Most of the time spent on construction and engineering problems.

Video captures your attention. Good synthesis of various themes; engineering, religion, history, glass production, etc., and cultural change. Enough repetition to help comprehension without becoming boring.",1492214400,2,2402,5.520435967302452

8407375,5,B003WKQ44Q,There was a lot of clever technology applied to make church walls of stained glass instead of the heavy castle like walls. The priest and intellectuals of the day came up with some very clever technology to accomplish their goals. The film focuses on the cathedrals of France only. Some problems occurred when they didn't think things through and pushed the race too far too fast. This is very similar to what we see today when we push technology to the outer limits and cell phones or hover boards explode and catch fire.,1476835200,,522,4.623655913978495
