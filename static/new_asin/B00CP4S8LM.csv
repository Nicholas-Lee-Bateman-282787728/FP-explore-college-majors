5731678,4,B00CP4S8LM,"Structured in an educational and fun way for young children. It shows an animal shelter and even tells kids how to care for their pet cats and dogs. There is some animation that younger kids will enjoy. The best parts are the drawing lessons. The style is aimed towards younger children, ages 4-8.

Mark takes viewers to a humane society before having them draw a cat and a dog.  He then goes to an ice cream shop before drawing ice cream and an ice cream truck.  This is a fun way to draw viewers into the drawing lesson!  Viewers will be interested in the subjects even if they aren't interested in drawing.

The professional illustrator, Mark Marderosian explains the instructions very well and makes it easy to follow along. It may motivate children to try their hand at drawing and exercising their creativity. It really does show how fun it is to draw. Older children may be more interested in the drawing lessons themselves and less with the field trips and animations.

It is very respectful of children, shows a kindness towards animals and invites the audience to participate by asking questions they can easily answer such as: ""What do all pets need?""

Here's what our kid jurors had to add: If you love drawing like me, then you'll love this DVD. ""Drawing With Mark"" teaches kids how to draw while also teaching them their shapes and some history about the things they draw. Kids also learn three or four fun facts about what they are drawing.

The ""Happy Tails"" part of this show is about cats and dogs and how to draw them. He also talks about how much responsibility it is to have a dog; you have to groom it, take care of it, bring it to the vet and feed it. In the ""Ice Cream"" episode, Mark goes to the ice cream shop and learns about children's' favorite ice cream flavors and you'll never guess: it's cake batter flavor! When I heard this I thought that it was funny because I would never think that they would make a cake batter flavored ice cream. The lead  characters in these episodes are Mark (Mark Marderosian), Crystal Cat and Eclipse Doggy.

I like that this show helped me be a better artist and I learned how to draw a dog and a cat better than I already did. I also learned how to draw an ice cream truck and a man holding an ice cream. I love watching this because I learned a lot and it made me understand the fundamentals of drawing. I also like that they put a live-action human with animated characters. I also like it when they went into the ice cream shop and they saw Crystal Cat On the toppings section, they thought that it was funny because they were talking about all of the toppings that the kids pick every time they come in and Crystal Cat was right there so they started laughing. There is no underlying message in this story, because it's about drawing, except maybe that no matter how old you are, you can draw big things.

I recommend this show to anyone that loves to draw to express their feelings, or to just have fun. I recommend this for people ages six and older because anyone can draw if they want to. I would give this DVD  four out of five because overall I liked it but I hoped that it had more music. Valdi B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",1378944000,2,3196,4.38917089678511
5731679,5,B00CP4S8LM,"Critically acclaimed with awards from Parents Choice, Creative Child Magazine, Dr. Toy and an Emmy nomination, the Drawing with Mark series is broadcast nationally and approved by KIDS FIRST. The series teaches as a whole teaches children of all ages how to draw (perfect for ages 5-9) while also including educational journeys to fun and exciting destinations. Former Disney illustrator Marderosian has a gentle approach to teaching that children love. Each episode starts with a visit to a fun destination and then transforms into a methodically wonderful lesson on how to draw related items. In this DVD, he visits an ice cream parlor and a local humane society, and then shows kids how to draw such items as a puppy, an ice cream cone, a cat and more. An absolutely wonderful way to have a child spend his/her afternoon.",1375833600,2,824,4.9352517985611515
8584215,5,B00CP4S8LM,"Delightful. My 6 year old could not believe what she was able to create with his step by step instructions. Plus, fun tidbits/facts/info on the subject (visit a local ice cream parlor, when was ice cream invented, etc.). Something productive for kids to do inside and I enjoyed watching/doing with her... worked for this mom (on the 80 hundredth snow day of the winter....).",1425600000,,374,4.859375
8584216,4,B00CP4S8LM,"This is a fine video and my 8 year-old aspiring artist daughter enjoys it. Mark seems like a really good guy and he is engaging and enthusiastic, as well as encouraging. Adding the advice about taking care of pets responsibly is a nice touch. Well done.

The reason (and it really isn't much of one) I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that his delivery seems aimed at 4 or 5 year-olds, but the subject matter (the drawing) is more in the 7 - 10 year-old range. He acts as if he is speaking to pre-K kids, but children of that age would be frustrated trying to draw the pictures per his instructions.

My daughter wasn't the least bit bothered by that, however. She is just happy to have this quality drawing instruction at her fingertips. Excellent video.",1413504000,,756,4.392857142857143
8584217,3,B00CP4S8LM,My 2nd and 3rd grade students draw more interesting animals than the ones presented on this DVD.  I use examples from drawing books or draw examples myself with better results.  Might work better for kindergarten students- if they have the patience to follow along.,1411516800,,265,5.0
8584218,1,B00CP4S8LM,"I had high hopes for this, but, oh my. Mark tries really hard, but he needs to smooth out his presentation a lot! It's like a local cable television show with bad graphics.",1399593600,,172,4.242424242424242
8584219,5,B00CP4S8LM,"I wanted some drawing DVD's  with step-by-step ""how to draw"" lessons for my little 8 year old artist.  Drawing with Mark is just what I was looking for and my daughter really enjoyed them.",1394323200,,188,4.5
8584220,5,B00CP4S8LM,"This DVD is the best of its kind.  Based on easy drawing principles for children, it teaches them not only to draw easily but incorporates educational information at an appropriate level using animation and puppets.  As an educator I highly recommend it.",1389398400,,254,5.023809523809524
8584221,5,B00CP4S8LM,"I ordered this for my great niece.  I really liked Mark's enthusiasm, his clear instructions and the emphasis on FUN. There is no pressure -  just watch and see what you can do.
I wish we'd had something like this when we were kids!",1384819200,,232,4.25
8584222,5,B00CP4S8LM,"I received this DVD of Drawing with Mark as a gift for my kids. I previewed it beforehand. I love it! It reminds me of Mr. Rogers & his fantastical & realistic world he would bring his viewers into. It was always so magical to me as a child & Drawing with Mark is exactly the same & reminds me of my childhood. I love the calm pace, the educational component, the visits to real life locations, that not only educate our kids, but raises awareness to local charities & businesses. I enjoy the fantasy world of the animation & it's fun & educational point of view & the huge bonus is your child can draw along with Mark. Creating art is so important to our kids education & Mark makes it possible. He explains & simplifies how to draw so well & makes it so much fun for your child. What's also nice is you can stop & start the DVD if you need extra time to draw too. There's even some bonus animation too,that's just adorable. The video is so wholesome & it's such a refreshing change from all the super, hyper, fast-paced children's programming out there that only promotes stupidity in our children. I know my kids will love it as much as I do & I highly recommend this program. I look forward to more episodes!! This really makes a great gift too!",1381968000,2,1249,4.274261603375527
8584223,5,B00CP4S8LM,"Drawing With Mark is a really fun, creative and worthwhile DVD. Considering how little time is devoted to art in public schools compared to when I was a kid, this is a much needed DVD as well. Being one of those kids who drew all the time, and grew up to be a professional artist, I have always had paper and pens available when my kid friends were visiting, but there are always kids who hang back because they think they don't have any talent. Mark,  presents the basics of drawing in a way that is easy to understand for young kids, easy to copy for kids who are developing their drawing skills and something all young artists need to know for creating more complex drawings. Drawing With Mark is relaxed, kind and informative, as well as entertaining, and there are also many fun layers within the show for kids of all ages. The Angels themselves, are cute little sidekicks who are also learning to draw and enjoy the ""field trips"" the show takes. Older kids will enjoy the locations visited and the interesting facts throughout the lesson.
Drawing teaches kids a lot of things that are worthwhile in all forms of education such as focusing on a task, attention, the ability to stay seated while completing a task, hand/eye control, following instructions and much more. The Drawing With Mark show will teach kids all of these skills but most importantly, it's entertaining too! I'm anxiously awaiting even more Drawing With Mark DVD's!!!",1381881600,,1442,4.699604743083004
8584224,5,B00CP4S8LM,"I bought this for my 10-year old daughter who loves to draw and doodle but has never really had any lessons. Although the animation is probably intended for slightly younger kids, she immediately liked Mark, the presenter, and sketched along with him as he taught her how to draw an ice cream cone (easy but hard to make it really good) and then a puppy. She was delighted and actually made me try the drawings too. Mine weren't quite as good ... but better than I'd ever done before! I'm lovin' it.",1381449600,,499,4.434782608695652
